Dead Space is the unofficial Alien game we always wanted! The horrific plight of starship engineer Issac Clark aboard the U.S.G Ishimura perfectly replicates the feeling of isolation and suspense of Ridley Scott's classic, while also innovating and branching out on its own right to create an impeccable homage to sci-fi horror which continually surprises and rewards with each astoundingly well thought out design decision.Immersion is everything to Dead Space. The complete lack of a standard HUD or in level load screens, inventory and menus screens that don't pause the game and the fact you are never taken away from Issac's perspective whether during gameplay or in menus, all combines to ensure you are never taken out of the experience. I have to commend the developer for what they have done with the HUD, placing standards like health and ammo counts not on a floating display but physically on the character and weapon at hand. It is one of the most original ideas I've seen in any game for years that takes something simple and makes it elegant, and taken as a whole this is one of the most atmospheric games ever released.Gameplay is equally ingenious in that it takes something we know, in this case the shooting mechanics of a game like Resident Evil 4, and turns it on its head. Disregarding the tried-and-true ""aim for the head"" mantra, you are required to dismember the tentacle like arms and legs of your enemies piece by piece, chopping them up into limbless husks in a concise and diligent manner conserving as much ammo as you can in the process. It's as gruesome as it sounds, but more than just an all out gore fest it lends a more strategic and thoughtful approach to combat that asks you to hold still and be precise with your shots in the midst of extreme peril, which gives it a feel all its own and playing other games afterwards starkly outlines how traditional many of them are in comparison.Of course none of this impromptu surgery would be possible without one of the best weapons in video game history: the plasma cutter. A tool of Issac's trade, it shoots a beam razor sharp plasma perfect for severing the many appendages of your foes, and can be rotated for an even more exact cut. It's so good in fact that it actually forms one of my few complaints, as the other more rudimentary tools of destruction are far less interesting and practical to use, to the point I actively tried to avoid having to take them out. Thankfully after a few upgrades that became a very rare occasion, and the plasma cutter certainly is enough to make up for the lack of other useful weapons.Despite going on more than a half decade at the time of this review, this is still an exceptionally good looking game which stands testament to how impressive it was to begin with. The environments are vivid and cohesive without growing sterile, and the expert use of shadows is still unmatched by many more recent games. Reference quality sound design sells the experience, almost demanding a high quality sound system or pair of headphones to fully appreciate. The plot never intrigued me in any great amount, but like Bioshock before it much of the exposition is left in the form of audio diaries and notes which provided a great deal of backstory on the events before your arrival, and help compensate for the otherwise lackluster narrative that only barely covers the typical video game chicanery of sending you to every corner of the ship in a rather contrived manner.One final note isn't so much a con as simply something that should be stated. Despite its horror trappings Dead Space is still an action game first and foremost. After the first hour or so enemy patterns and scare tactics become easy to spot and predict, which while not detracting from the experience may disappoint some hoping to be frightened out of their wits. That said it is still very apt at getting your pulse up through the ever constant gloom and tenseness of its atmosphere, which even if it doesn't scare you should be more than enough to excite and increase your heart rate.For anyone not turned off by the extremely graphic violence, Dead Space is a must play. It excels at pulling you into its world and keeping you absorbed in it through an increadible atmophere that goes almost unmatched. With every step forward developer EA Redwood Shore (now renamed to the more fitting Visceral Games) show an acute knowledge of game design, never content to reiterate something already done without making it their own, and is does more for the horror action genre than probably any game since RE4. I was blown away with every passing moment, and cannot wait to dive into what horrors the future games hold. If you haven't already taken a trip aboard the Ishimura, there's no better time than now to do so, as I can assure you its a journey you won't soon forget.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

 Pros -Great atmosphere. -Great sound design. -Fun story and world. -Very fun and satisfying game play.  The dismemberment is incredibly well realized. -Monster design-One of the best minimalist HUD.  Cons -Can feel like one long fetch quest where everything goes wrong. -Monster diversity. -Running the game without vsync creates lights flickers due to the high frame rate at which the game runs on modern system. (fix by enabling vsync in the Nvidia control panel, in game vsync limit the game at 30fps) Neutral -Some of the mission objectives can become annoying.Great game overall, highly recommend it.			"

Shoot the limbs and dismember them. That should do the job.'Who Goes There?' — it's a science-fiction novella, written by John W. Campbell, which was adapted by John Carpenter as the 1982 famous film 'The Thing'. This phrase is well-suited as a slogan, which expresses all the essence of 'Dead Space' and emphasizes the outlines of its creators' intention.This game has the full right to be a challenger for the title of most creepy, brutal, nightmarish and atmospheric third-person shooter with horror elements of all time. 'Dead Space' stands as a perfect example of the unity of well-thought-out Sci-fi setting and a sinister survival action. Here we've got spectacular, dramatic storyline, smart gameplay, innovative design and stunning soundtrack.And although it's not 2008 now, but perhaps my review will encourage someone who hasn't yet been on the USG Ishimura decks to play this masterpiece.10/10			"

												Reasons why you should get this game -This game has an amazing 80's sci-fi/horror atmosphere and storyline. -Using stasis+the flamethrower is the most satisfying feeling in any game ever -It manages to keep you on edge, yes there are jump scares, but I found that the most terrifying moment is not knowing what creatures you will be up against next or what your next mission will entail. Reasons I would reconsider:-Would suggest using a controller for this game simply because the camera controls are a little difficult to work with.-The flickering lights don't really feel like they are flickering but more like the monitor is acting up (luckily there aren't too many scenes with flickering lights)   "

												Dead Space is, in my opinion, a good game. However, I've read many negative reviews calling the game terrible, which led me pretty confused because of how much I enjoyed playing through it. I'm the kind of guy who enjoys reading a lot of negative reviews before buying a game to see what isn't good about it, so I thought I'd dedicate a review to all people who aren't sure what to expect in this game because of reviews' conflicted opinions. No need to thank me, really. Yes, I love you too.""The controls suck""Huh... I dunno, I found they good. All I had to do was lower my mouse sensitivity in the options menu. Hey, maybe I'm a lucky dude, but even then, I'm pretty sure there's a Steam guide called ""How to fix mouse control problems"". I've also seen people complain about how Isaac takes one third of the screen, or how there's a deadzone (which never bothered me once) when it comes to aiming. My answer is : you wouldn't want to feel too comfortable playing a horror game now, would you? The limited FOV and the kinda awkward camera help the game feel scarier and more dangerous. If people call the weird camera angles in Resident Evil good game design, I don't see why this game shouldn't get the same treatment.""The game's glitchy""I haven't ran into a single glitch. While playing it, I even told myself more than once ""Wow, it's impressive how well coded this game is!"". Again, I think I probably just am a lucky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I guess. Maybe the game is trash on other systems. I heard there are game-breaking glitches, though! So you might want to save in different slots every once in a while. Never happened to me, but I guess you should watch out.""The story sucks""no""Dead Space isn't scary""...Yeah, I kinda agree with this one. Dead Space focuses a lot on disgust to scare the player, so if you're fine with the weird grotesque enemies (like me), this game isn't going to make you pee your pants. Many people call this game absolutely terrifying though, and you just may be one of these people... It depends on you. So why would people like me enjoy a horror game they don't find that scary? Answer's simple : the ATMOSPHERE. Dead Space's atmosphere is amazingly done, and even though I always knew the worst that could happen to me is some jumpscare that wouldn't be even close to making me scared (they're very predictable), I was often tense and paranoid. This is because of several things : amazing sound design, great soundtrack, good game design in general, but what really got me is the gameplay. Because if I'm not careful, enemies might just ambush me, make me use all my medpacks while I waste ammo trying to get a good shot at them, all of this using a gun I don't like because I'm trying to save ammo for that one gun I'm running low on ammunition with. ♥♥♥♥ing up has consequences in a game with limited resources. And that tension just makes the game great for me.To conclude, if you're interested in this game, just buy it. There's a refund option you can use if you've played less than two hours, so just use it if the game hasn't been working well for you. Hope you have fun/♥♥♥♥ your pants while cutting some necromorph limbs "

												Holy jeez this game scared the crap out of me! I love everything about this game, from the terryfying scenes to the hardcore gameplay.

												One of the best Space Horror games. Dead Space made me feel helpless & hopeless while moving forward through the unending tunnels, teeming of necromorphs...

												Yep, I'm 6 years late to the party with Dead Space, and even though it is that old, it still holds up well to being one of the most well-made games I have ever had the pleasure of playing. This is one of the few games that I was able to carry on straight into a second play through after finishing the first one. This is a third person, action, horror survival game, and you play the ever mute engineer Isaac Clarke.The scariness of the game is very much factor that dwindles as you play more and more. To begin with, every little noise kept me from turning a corner, but towards the end, the jump factor worse thin on most things. Even though the game is 6 years old, it still looks absolutely stunning, giving you plenty of chances to show off that lens flare in screenshots.  The combat can seem very difficult to get to grips with at first, but I bloody love how each part of the aliens can just blow up and be removed from the The game is locked at 30 fps until you turn off v-sync, which is on by default for some reason, although once you do turn  it off, your mouse controls become very slow and the only way I could get round this was by turning my DPI settings all the way up to max on my mouse itself. All in all, Dead Space is one of the past decades classic must play titles. Find more reviews at http://www.completingthebackloggroup.com/ "

												""The marker must be returned to the planet,IT MUST"" and to be honest i was glad that i to returned to this classic game and i really enjoyed losing my sanity all over again.I played this game when it first came out on the X-BOX 360 and at the time thought it was one of the best game's i had ever played and on finishing down loading it i was a little worried and concerned if i was still going to love it as much as i did and if after all this time i would not feel the same way about it ?????Of course i need not have worried as this game still pack's the same punch now as it did then,and still impressed me with both its jump scare's and its all together moment's of sheer horror i did not see coming the first time round and they still managed to make me jump out of my chair again this time as well.Dead Space - Official Trailer - YouTube

To most the plot wont need explaining and i wont go into to much detail here let's just say this,the game is set in the year 2508 and the USG Ishimura a ""planetcracker"" starship send's out a distress signal during a mining operation on the planet Aegis VII.The Concordance Extraction Corporation (CEC) send's the USG Kellion to investigate.After a guidance system malfunction crash'es the Kellion into the Ishimura dock (in explosive fashion),the crew set's out and tries to find other mean's of transport.As they explore what appear's to be an abandoned ship they find out it is'nt that abandoned after all,that's when the horror truely begin's for engineer Isaac Clarke, Commander Zach Hammond, and Computer Specialist Kendra Daniels as they encounter thing's that are (shall we say) no longer what they once were.The graphic's in this game are still as impressive now as they were when the game was first released (and that was 6 year's ago-and yet this game can still pack quite a graphical punch),and the enemies and the ship still look as good now as they did then.The sound and music in game are (not to put to finer point on it) amazing and really do help the scare's along and help you feel all together unnerved about your time on this haunted and possesed ship from hell.""Dead Space 1"", full HQ original soundtrack (OST) - YouTube

												9/10Overview: Survival Horror-Third Person Shooter The Good:+Graphics+Lighting+Atmosphere+No HUD makes things more immersive +I love that once you gain control of the main character, you never lose control, there are no cutscenes, cgi or anything that takes away control of the character. All the action takes place from the characters perspective and that provides an extra layer of immersion. +The game provides a great sense of pacing, slowly introducing new enemies, gameplay mechanics, locations and puzzles to keep you second guessing what's around the next corner. +Variety of weapons+Finding nodes throughout the ship as well as purchasing it in the store allows you to upgrade your weapons and suit+Combat, shooting limbs off enemies is satisfying+Monsters look, feel and act scary along with good diversity to keep combat engaging. +Variety of death animations+Sound effectsThe Average:Disappointing last bossThe story can be very predictableA few crashesThe Bad- The game has some technical issues that you should be aware about specifically regarding vsync, mouse lag, frame rates. Turn off vsync to get the best possible experience. ConclusionThis is arguably one of the best horror games to come out in the last decade. It does so many things right in the genre. I STRONGLY recommend this game to anybody who either loves survival horror games or third person shooters. "

												Dead Space is pretty cool, I guess.Set in the distant future of 2002, you play as Isaac Clarke, a man with two dads: Isaac Newton and Arthur Clarke. Unlike many Sci-Fi protagonists, Isaac is a space Engineer, which is like a normal Engineer but in space. And if EA promotional content is anything to go by, Isaac is also a golfer, a skateboarder, a mercenary, a world famous pugilist, and probably a really good kisser. One day, Isaac and friends go to fix a bunch of broken stuff aboard the USG Ishimura, a ship that's literally named ""Rock Village"". Unfortunately it does the opposite of make villages out of rocks and instead cracks planets open to eat the sweet sweet planet juice hiding inside. Ooh baby.  Unfortunately, someone opened the space zombie can and now there are space zombies everywhere.On the bright side, even though Isaac majored in engineering, he also apparently minored in being a unkillable death god from the 4th dimension because Isaac's right hook hits with about enough force to send the moon out of orbit and crashing into the planet below. When this game was still coming out back in 2008, the developers boasted that Isaac was at a disadvantage because he was an engineer and not a space marine. But Isaac still opens up more cans of Whoop A than the entire Earth military combined. It must be all that pent up space sexual frustration. Because he's in space. The most unique aspect is that, outside of maybe one or two weapons, Isaac remains in his field of expertise in terms of equipment. But then again, his first weapon is called a plasma cutter. As in a tool that cuts things with plasma. Why don't you just give him a asteroid chainsaw while you're at it? Actually, do that, that would be awesome. But outside of developer words, Isaac is a huge faker. Sure he screams at everything and runs like a girl. But at the same time the guy can quick draw and open fire like the best of them.  But lets stop talking about that hunk of murder for a moment and talk about the Ishimura itself.The Ishimura is the largest and oldest ship of it's class. Roughly 1.6 Km in length if the wiki is to be believed. When you're inside it's dark, dingy, Event Horizon inspired interior, you can actually kind of believe that people lived in there. Outside of the workbench and the machine that sells you murder tools for money. There are constant reminders that the Ishimura at one point, had it's own ecosystem and community. The ship seems to have everything from accommodations, recreational areas, movie theaters, video games, posters of products, vending machines, and even a restaurant. My favorite was the Zero-G basketball. Get dunked on, son. The Necromorphs, Daughter Space's antagonists, are gross little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Originally the inhabitants of the USG Stonetown, the necromorphs now hunt through the halls, killing anything that doesn't look like them as well as spreading this weird mossy flesh stuff that looks like the stuff I find on my toilet seat.But now that everyone is dead, outside of a few induviduals, as well as all of the angry space zombies onboard, is the Ishimura scary? Well, outside of the atmoshpere, no, not really. If anything the game is like a reverse horror story about alien lifeforms doing their best to try and stop an angry man covered in metal bits, jacked up on blue milk and packing more heat than the Detroit police department. Is Dad Space a good horror game? No. Is it fun? Yes, I would say so. The weapons are crunchy and fun to use, the enemies have enough variety to make you switch up your strategies, and there's enough bread crumbs and rewards for exploration to get you into finding audio logs and picking up space money to buy space stuff.  I'm not saying that Dude Space would be scarier if Isaac was defenseless. I happen to not enjoy horror games where you run away a bunch very fun because I'm already very good at running away from my problems. I'm just saying that maybe they should have turned it down a bit, maybe even gave Isaac less equipment but more evasion options, such as hiding or sweet slide tackles. Not even half way through the game I had to start putting health items away because my aim is as perfect as I am handsome and I was losing space for ammo in favor of the blue milk boxes. But should you play Father Area? It's a fun game, just not a scary one. I did not find myself pooping my pants or screaming really loudly for YouTube money. But I did find an appeal in going from room to room exterminating the space Vampires. It's almost like a natural selection thing.Man eat planet.Space zombies eat man.Immortal war god eat space zombie. DeDe Laboratory is on the cheap, and usually goes down in price during sales. Give the game a looksy, maybe it'll hook you in for the sequels, which I'm heading to next. It's definitely one of EA's better games, but that's probably not saying much considering the crimes they commit on a regular basis. Ded Sposs gets 8 irate space miners out of 10. Also, apparently the game had really gory death scenes but I didn't get any of those because I'm objectively the best.Just the best.The best Curator: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience "

Intro:The Dead Space games are survival horrors!! The series takes place in outer space in the 26th century. Mankind has expanded into space and colonized other planets, but Earth herself is in ecological crisis, having been drained of resources. EarthGov currently resorts to ""planet-cracking"" - the processing of mining entire planets for the recovery of raw materials, with a fleet of specially constructed space-faring vessels. However, EarthGov is investigating a second possibility. During the 23rd century, the Chicxulub crater was found to contain a ""Marker"" - an artifact of extraterrestrial origin which acts as a relay for a persistent electromagnetic field signal, with no apparent source.You are Isaac Clarke,  the protagonist and a ship systems engineer who is on a routine repair mission and hoping to make contact with his girlfriend who was stationed on the damaged vessel. Soon, all hell breaks loose and Isaac needs to survive the Necromorph scourge.A central theme in the games is the fictional antagonistic cult religion ""Unitology"". To me, there are many similarities between the fictional Unitology and the real-world Scientology, which I found interesting. (I am not a Scientologist, btw).To improve playability (this older game) in Windows 10, I used the following resources:1)  PCGamingWiki - Deadspace[pcgamingwiki.com] 2)  [Fixed] How to Fix Dead Space Mouse Lag - Solution 3)  Dead Space:: Get your game to work properlyGame ThoughtsThis was the second game I played in the Horror/Survival Horror Genre. I really enjoyed it! So much, I bought and played Dead Space 2. I will also buy Dead Space 3 when it is on sale. I only wish it was on Steam! This is the 1st game I used a controller with on my PC. I used a PS4 Dual Shock controller... I was not that accurate, so it took me a long while getting thngs done. :(I had a blast with this game. My rating system for Horror based games is: The Sphincter Factor. 1 thru 51 - Totally Open, you need surgery to fix this Muscle (game) ->5 - Totally Closed (Superb)! Tight as a well diggers a$$ (The Tops, a great game)The Sphincter Factor for Dead Space = Solid 4.5- Great replayability,- Great atmosphere, IMO,- Awesome soundtrack,- Decent story, - You can upgrade weapons and character armor, and- Boss fights were challenging (for me) and awesome!

IntroWelcome new recruit, hope you enjoy traveling through the emptiness and void of space as you traverse a deserted ship for signs of life that cried for help before their lives faded away. Once again another game that is so horrific by the end of it I hope the main character just has common sense to ask for a pay increase.AtmosphereDead Space is a great atmosphereic game that has alot of variety in enemies. While I did not find this game to be much of a ""horror"" like how I think of Amensia I did find it to be a very good action-thriller.Tools as Weapons+ Weapons and Gear can be upgradedNormally you would pick up a gun, and shoot aliens, however in this game you modify your tools to become weapons, each expressing its own style and functionality, constantly becoming powerful based how way you upgrade, really helps  blowing off limbs from alien hordes.Role as Engineer+ Repairing sections of the ship variesPlaying as a engineer feels very aethentic, repairing the ship, one section at a time feels not only rewarding but exciting, watching it come to life the further you go down the rabbit hole, while upgrading your gear along the way to avoid being overcome by the monsters laying in wait.Enemies+ Good Variety of Enemies+ Limb System adds dynamic ways to deal with enemyThere is a good selection of enemies and bosses to blow apart in this game. Brought me back to the days when games like doom had alot of variety in monsters. Their weaknesses being their limbs is also very interesting and somehow at the same time disturbing to a degree. A shame you cannot make any snowmen out of their limbs would be a real good scare for the children.ConclusionFor those who want to play a game where you play as a engineer who goes through a isolated spaceship and blast the limbs off your enemy I do not know why you are still reading this.Disclaimer: You might get so used to using tools as weapons that you go into your shed and modify everything into weapons and walk out like a berserker in a RPG fully geared to rock and load.

												One of the best triple A titles I have ever played. You are Isaac Clarke, an engineer who has traveled to a Planet Cracker class ship to fix a communication relay, your motivation, the woman you love. Things aren't so hunky dorey when you get there and what ensues is one of the best, albeit frustrating at times, survival-horror games ever made.+The game still looks beautiful 6 years after release and there are plenty of opportunities for great screenshots+Combat occasionally feels clunky but very satisfying when you dismember enemies+Overall gameplay is good and rewarding +Challenging boss fights+Resource management is challenging but adds another level of gameplay to Dead Space+When you complete the game you can start over with all of your items as well as some rewards for completing the game+/-The plot, while the storyline itself is excellent, especially the twist at the end, some parts of the game are incredibly frustrating, e.g. 'Oh great you managed to find that thing which will save us! Oh but I just realised actually it won't be good enough, go find something else'+/-Even medium difficulty is challenging at times, personally I like this but others may not+/-Creepy enemies but not a particularly scary game especially compared to DS2-Aiming while using matter cannons or while suspended by a 'large' necromorph is absolutely appalling even with a controller, very difficult to tell which way you need to move the weapon in order to get it in the right position-Mouse controls aren't great and controller sensitivity can't be changed-When using the steam overlay your normal mouse may appear in the game after using the mouse in the overlay-No achievementsVerdict:8.5This is easily one of my favourite games and I'm so glad I played it to completion.El K.

I take a deep breath. Come on, I tell myself, it's just another corner. You can't just stay here, wherever ""here"" is on this endlessly large and chaotic ship. And anyway, they'll come for you, sooner or later, here or there, so you might as well just go. Still, it takes all my resolve to move on, carefully aiming the welder straight ahead, expecting to be jumped at any moment now.Dead Space is the single most horrifying game I've ever played. It uses all the familiar horror tropes - isolation, darkness, the unknown, delusion, overwhelming odds, mistrust - and manages to not only make them believable in a sci-fi setting, but so visceral that they'll grip the player from the moment they set foot on the Ishimura. Nothing. Long corridors of nothing. Nothing but the noises, the creaks, the constant tension, the flickering lights, the many, many wall panels, each and every one fit to hide one of the horrors that crawl through the intestines of this ship, that have infected it to the core. And when they finally catch up with me, as they inevitably will, it still, STILL comes as a surprise, sending me frantically pacing backwards every time, aiming for... anything. Heads, limbs, whatever it is that keeps these monsters alive.Between all the scares and darkness, Dead Space also manages to be beautiful, almost transcendent at times. The quiet, damaged, empty bridge of the Ishimura, with its high glass panes, looking out into infinite space, for example, allowing you a moment of peace after encountering something that almost would've been the end of your journey. Space is peaceful, quiet, soothing, but it's a deceptive peace, trying to lower my defenses, distract me from the dangers that lurk all around me, just waiting or a chance to get to me. But... it's so beautiful. So calm. Can't I, just for a moment, rest among the stars, forget about the nightmare I'm in? Just for a moment...Even after all this time that I've played this game, I feel myself on occasion thinking back on it, remembering pieces, scenes, locations, sometimes dreaming about it. It's not often that anything gets under my skin like that, but Dead Space certainly did.			"

												I finally got around to this game. I played it bit by bit over time and it was quite enjoyable. Although it's in the horror genre, I didn't find it to be too scary, instead it felt like a slower-paced FPS dungeon crawler in space, which was great.I loved the theme of using engineering tools as weapons, and they made things interesting by making it more effective to dismember the enemies rather than just shooting for headshots or at the center of mass.There are a few caveats though.It is not a very good port. The mouse cursor feels terrible by default. You can fix the in-game mouse by locking the framerate to 60fps (see the PC Gaming Wiki[pcgamingwiki.com] for info) and use the keyboard for the inventory and menus. I also didn't care for the default camera view, so increasing the FOV using the Widescreen Fixer app[widescreenfixer.org] helped a lot. I set mine to +0.31.In all, it was a good game and I am looking forward to moving on in the series, hoping that a little more thought was put into the ports for the sequels.			"

												This game was released in 2008 and I am playing it for the first time here in 2015.  I have to say this is a fan-freaking-tastic game.Pros:-Graphics and textures were amazing for an older game.-The sounds and music in the game were fantastic. Made for some good scary moments. I jumped plenty of times.-Great upgrade and progression path of weapons and items.-Unique game physics and in game resource management.-Loved the 3rd person perspective.-Great weapon choices and secondary fire actions.Cons:-At times, felt a little repetitive and tedious having to always run back to the start to finish the missions.-At times, camera angles and aiming were difficult in tight corridors.-While the in game save feature is pretty unique, it got tedious constantly finding a save point and having to click through 3 screens to save.Overall, I would give this game a strong 8.5/10.I would highly recommend playing and picking it up on the next Steam sale.

												Dead Space is a game that achieved instant classic status with me. An honorary spot on my shelf.After finishing the game (which took me a while), I realized that the game had me on edge the entire time. And I mean the whole heart racing, eye wide open and sweaty palms deal.This game is very and I mean very good at maintaining an atmosphere which keeps you on the edge constantly second guessing your every move and wondering what is around that corner, that vent, that elevator.While steam only logged 30-ish hours of game play, I played my disk to death on my xbox. Literally, it has been run to the bare plastic film (May upload a screenshot later).Graphics: 9.5/10Sound: 10/10Gameplay: 9.9/10Atmosphere: 10/10I can and gladly will expand on the details of the above four catagories if you are contemplating on purchasing this game. Just simply send me a friend request and I will gladly tell it all.Bottom line: If you want to play a horror game set in deep space where no one can hear you scream, look no further for you've found the game.

												I played this game a lot when it came out in 2008. It's the scariest game in the Dead Space series. The gameplay reminded me of Resident Evil 4, the sci-fi element and horror reminded me of System Shock. Though I could never really enjoy the story or the Dead Space world, I appreciated how much work went into expanding it (mini-games, movies and books). What I enjoyed most about this game is the complete lack of UI. Without the UI the whole experience feels more like watching a movie (found footage?). I think that this is one of those games that you just have to have in your Steam Library.

												Steven King, that very prolific author, delineates three types of fear. First is the gross-out, or disgust; the thing you want to get away from. The second is horror, the unkown; an aversion to things that you do not quite understand. And finally there is terror, the creepiness; when something is so close to being normal, but off by a tiny bit that makes it completely uncomfortable to look at. Dead Space wants to be scary, so it taps into all three fears. However, it ultimately relies more on disgust and the jump-scare than anything else.Dead Space is a third person survival shooter set in space. You play Isaac Clarke, an engineer sent to repair the deep-space mining craft 'Ishimura'. Unfortunately, the ship is overrun with space-zombies called necromorphs and something really shifty is going on there so your job quickly becomes to get off that metal hunk before you're brutally murdered. As mentioned earlier, Dead Space is more like a shooter than a horror game. The trope of horror is invoked, with the shadows creeping along the walls and monsters scurrying in the vents while you can only hope they don't jump you when you're looking the other way. When the horror subsides the gross-out takes over as the monsters are disgusting amalgamtions of bodyparts with claws where hands used to be and tentacles from every orifice looking to turn you into deli-meat if you don't shred them before they get in your face. Is the game terrifying at any time? Once, in a cutscene for a second or so, but when you do the math, Dead Space is a survival disgust shooter. The reason why it isn't horror is because you get a good glimpse and understanding of your foes. The necromorphs all waddle toward you and they'll let you pick them off. Dead Space does not work quite like most zombie games. Necromorphs are completely unimpressed when you behead them. No, you have to dismember them; tear them limb from limb. This creates for some cool gameplay mechanics where you'll aim for the legs to slow them down and then tear their arms off to finish the job. Yet, some enemies require a more measured approach where you have to get around them or prevent them from falling in the first place, otherwise they'll spawn more trouble. Occasionally one will get the drop on you, but you're not scared of the creeps; you're spooked, anxious and thrilled, but not fearful. You're armed to the teeth to such an extent that you only really fear for your life, and that is classified as suspense. Dead Space plays much like Resident Evil 4 and 5 in terms of controls. You aim with a laser pointer and use your ammo conservatively. You can use special powerups to slow enemies down or to throw the set pieces at them. You're a veritable slayer of monsters and everytime you gear up with new tools you start to look the part as well. What also helps the suspenseful atmosphere is the intergrated HUD. You don't have a screen overlay; your health and ammo are displayed on your character's model and interacting with the world is done in the same manner. It creates a keen level of immersion that not many shooters can attain. When all is said and done, Dead Space makes good use of its atmosphere and lighting to build suspense and to release that tension at the best moments. You're on the edge of your seat, holding on for dear life as you fight off the hordes of disgusting creatures. Even the bossfights are a well measured and carefully calculated ordeal that keep you sucked in and fighting for survival without resorting to cheap set-pieces or quick-time events. Dead Space is an amazingly atmospheric thrill shooter that needs to played if only for its amazing presentation.			"

												I know this game is quite ""old"", I think it came out in 2008 or something like that but not only until now I got around to playing it. Dead Space is possibly not a horror game for me, it has some jumpscares and sometimes when a new enemy appeared I kinda freaked out trying to learn how to defeat him. The game itself relies on the dismemberment of enemy limbs in order to kill them, it also features some puzzle ""sections"" where you need to manipulate gravity and slow down ""stuff"" using your stasis in order to complete a certain objective. The soundtrack really keeps up the rythm and the action of the game with some intense sections where the music pumps in. Now, as far as I'm aware the PC version was ported from the 360 version and somehow (I doubt it's just me) they forgot to get rid of the mouse acceleration and smoothing which really annoyed me quite some times but once you get used to it, it's all good. Now, for me, the strongest point of Dead Space has to be the story, it's kinda ""unique"" per say and I really dig into these sort of religion fanatics messing up with alien tech. Another thing I must say is that the developers really put alot of effort into making the game world ""realistic"", across the USG Ishimura you'll find various advertising panels some of which are different and I feel like those small additions to the world design really make it unique and engaging. I believe I have nothing else to say about Dead Space besides telling you to go give it a try if you haven't played or beated it yet.			"

												This is the one that started it all. Join engineer Isaac Clarke on his creepy space adventure, wherein you must fight your way through an infestation of horrid undead abominations and face off against a fanatical death cult.In order to get the game to work correctly I would highly suggest looking up what other users have done to tweak the game’s settings, as it suffers from horrible console port-itus. Here’s a quick reference for ya.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Dead_SpaceDon’t let this dissuade you from playing it however, as it is a highly entertaining, monster filled romp through the bowels of the USG Ishimura, a gunmetal grey and black mining ship that literally rips out the cores of planets for relentless human resource consumption.If you like futuristic space horror, this is one of the best.

~This Game is a Defining Space Horror Game, although more action packed than something like Alien: Isolation but the Environment coupled with the Smart Mechanics and Formidable Enemy AI are the strong points of this EA Game!Alright let’s get Started on The Good Aspects first:Pros:+The Story is Immersive and Deep on the Scale of 3+ games. There’s much to understand, the whole cause of chaos experience in the Ishimura is not only explained in DS1 but also in other forms of media such as Books, Animated Movies, Graphics novels, a Wii Game and even a little Mobile game (How cute).  No Spoilers here but there are many things that contribute to the Plot such as that Universe's Primary ""religion"" (AKA- Cult) called Unitology.+Speaking of Story, a Bulk of the Backstory, is found from Logs within the Levels (Well Hidden of course.) This really Helps the Player (Isaac Clarke) understand Many Characters, Events and even teaches them how to play Zero-G Basketball!!+The HUD is very Realistic; it is Projected outwards in front of Isaac's face when he walks. Want to Rummage through Ammo while a battle is happening? You will most likely Die...+The Difficulties are very balanced for the types of gamer out there, from a simple run and gun easy difficulty with lots of supplies (i find it too many) to the Impossible mode which has fewer checkpoints, OP Enemies, hardly any Supplies (Just the way i like it), Bad Starting Suits, Few upgrades and a loss of that checkpoint instantly if you close/exit the game at all. That’s for the Hard-core Gamer who prefers a true horror Experience.+Loading Times? Where?+Atmosphere is undoubtedly the game’s biggest Strong Point. an almost empty ships filled with Necromorphs ( which are actually the ships deceased crew that, due to an Alien Virus, have Transformed into Bloodthirsty Recombinated Necromorphs!....Its complicated.) that seem to be around every dark corner (There’s quite a few!) The Metallic Clang of Claws in a vent above you, or the Creaking of the Hull, or Heavy Thuds from the Asteroid belt pelting the ship are all some prime examples of how well the game deals with the unique atmosphere. It’s a Mix of Event Horizon, The Thing and even System Shock 2!+Scares a-plenty!+Extremely Innovative targeting Mechanic= Strategic Dismemberment, go for the Limbs..+Sound is Very Realistic and Proportional, some moments you have to stand still and be quiet to hear where the necromorph is crawling...Can you hear that too?+Weapon Options are plentiful+Interesting Currency and requirements to get some Credits+Upgradable Suits (up to 6 levels!)+HUD is very informative, you will hardly ever get lost with the 3D map Design+New Game Plus Ability (Definietely Worth it)+Boss Battles are Excellent and each are around the right length as well.Huge Alien Creatures vs Puny Engineer with a Bulky Suit but Heavy Weapons and  Badass ""Gadgets""= Interesting/Gory Results!+Death Animations, Mortal Kombat meets the Thing! Blood will be spilled, then  poured and then Splashed! (R18 for this reason!)

Cons:-The Story is handled very slowly, which is bad for fast paced gamers. Easy to  Normal Mode should be the Right speed for most players.-By Default, the Mouse Sensitivity and Smoothing is Very awkward and irregular.-Crashes during Big Battles, with lots on the screen. Very rare though.-Linear Levels with little Variaton. Although you are on the Ship it would be  nice to see differently themed levels.-Lack of Interactive Items in levels-Many Collectibles can be too Difficult to find in 1 or even 2 playthroughs,  guide recommended.-Save File can be Overwritten Accidentally due to placement when you are  saving!!-Characters are hardly touched apon in detail. Little Emotional Connection  between the Player and Isaac! (Which is not good, because of his Motivations)-No Co-op, would have added a slightly more action feel. (Good and Bad)-No Achievements, Minor really.-Graphics issues include: Stuttering,Frame Drops and bad resolution by default.-Backtracking during the early parts up the Middle is really irritating!Final Thoughts?It has lots of replay value with suits and upgrades to try outBut id recommend buying during a sale since its been out for about 8 Years!!  (Already??)Its a Good Game just By Itself without the Sequels to steer the Underlying  Plot. (This is Because the other 2 PC games are more action orientated) Definetely a Wise choice for a Horror game Fan/Collector.It has aged well too, using many innovative features that would be on the level  of many horror games today!Isaac Clarke the Everyday Engineer turned Space-Hero, has a Realistic Feel to  it that fits well with the Plot.Final Score: 8/10!...Now wheres that Peng??-Kyle

												If it's lying on the ground, kill it. Don't matter if it looks mangled beyond recognition; if it's lying on the ground, you kill it with everything that you've got.That's the first and basic rule of Dead Space: a game that's full of horrifying surprises around every corner. This game is so scary, you'll feel relieved upon meeting that one random guy, banging his battered head against the wall. Everything that moves either wants to decapitate you, or make you one of their own - and those resilient beings will stop at nothing to get to you, unless you tear off their pointy limbs apart from their fast-moving bodies. The Necromorphs can crawl through the vents, and appear out of the blue - ready to pounce at a moment's notice. And what better man to face them than a hardened engineer who fights these abominations with space shop tools? Isaac Clarke acts like a desentisized shell for the player, lacking emotions and words to speak, with only one goal in mind: to find his girlfriend. In short, he's the perfect horror everyman - and he's too in love to let the undead freaks get in the way to his sweetheart.And there you have it.			"

 ""In space no one can hear you scream.” Dead Space represents a great third person shooter experience with intense horror elements and interesting combat mechanics. It is very atmospheric with ambient creepy sounds and music, which will keep you on edge. The slow-paced movement of the protagonist also contributes to the immersive atmosphere.The other large appeal of Dead Space is the combat system. Instead of going for the typical headshot, it introduces the strategic dismemberment. You must cut off certain limbs to kill your enemies, which is a welcomed variety within the shooter genre to unlearn the headshot.The absorbing storyline is another strength offered by the game, especially the background story profits from it and is continued in Dead Space 2.  Trivia: The weapons in Dead Space are mostly improvised from mining tools, such as a plasma cutter, rotary saw, a hydrazine torch (repurposed flamethrower), a high-energy contact beam, and a force cannon that emits powerful shock waves. Achievements: The game has no Steam achievements.

												I got this game years ago on another... online... game distrobution platform. A friend told me to play because I love horror games. I played the first few chapters and was so stressed out I ended up taking a break for over a year! I finally finished the game a few months before Dead Space 2 came out. It still stands out as THE most stressful, scary, and panic inducing games I have ever played.Even though it's ""old"" it has aged well and even through all the blood and gore, it's still beautiful. Dig into the story and you'll enjoy this even more. Dead Space is the only game series that I've geeked out hard enough to read books about, it's that good. I hold the DS series at the top of my list of best games, right along with the Half-Life, Portal, and Mass Effect games.			"

This is definitely one of the best games I've played in awhile.  I can't get into horror literature (my coworker once handed me some horror book and I just laughed at what I was reading...it just sounded too ridiculous to feel real and scary), but movies and videogames handle that genre brilliantly.What I liked:-I mostly love how Dead Space handles lockdown situations....  Without spoiling too much, I'll just say there are alot of situations where the game messes with your head - it throws a curveball and acts like it's helping you...but the situation gets worse.  -Being able to enter Zero-G and Vacuum areas is also fairly unique to this game and they add a bit of flair and puzzle factor to the mix of suspense and grotesque combat.  -The weapon selection is another of my favorite features, because they look like unassuming mining equipment, but - when activated - do so much more.  What I didn't like:-Potential spoiler, hover to read --> Unfortunately, like similar games System Shock and Half-Life, there are alot of ""situations"" that aren't affected by your actions.  Alot of crew the game wants you to save cannot be saved.  This makes the game boring, even depressing to go through, since you have no control over the outcome.-I also don't like the predictability of jumpscares (they still shock me every time - but you can tell there's a pattern).  -The mouse/controller sensitivity isn't easy to adjust for a game that requires precise aim.I had been putting this game on the back burner for so long because I thought it might be too scary, but I'm glad I jumped into it.  Totally worth it! "

												After beating this game, I can honestly say, I have no clean underwear.  There are a few annoyances though with this game on PC.  -You need to cap your FPS at about 120 otherwise you will run into various issues-using the ingame vsync options creates a HUGE amout of input lag-the y-axis on your mouse moves slower than your x-axisOther than the game being just old with issues listed above, the game is amazing.  Definitly with going through the fixes to play it.			"

												One of the greatest horror games of the last generation, for sure. Dead Space builds up suspense and tension, using a sci-fi environment, a creepy atmosphere, and lots of blood. You play as engineer Isaac Clarke, who goes on a routine mission to repair a damaged spaceship. Obviously the mission isn't so routine, and it's up to Isaac to find his girlfriend Nicole and escape with the rest of his crew. The enemies are known as the Necromorphs - humans who have changed into hideous creatures. Over the course of the game you will find new weapons, armor, and upgrades to help you along the way. Just be sure to stop playing the series at two; Dead Space 3 is a whole new kind of monster...			"

												TL;DR: Intense sci-fi horror with great atmosphere and solid gameplay mechanics; an old gem that still holds its own.For a player that was never interested in survival horror Dead Space was still attractive due to its setting and premisis. Having played it a long time ago on console and now revisiting it on PC, this game is still fantastic for old and new fans of the genre.Positive features:-Genuine horror elements-Satisfying gun play with a different range of weapons and upgrades-Graphically impressive and well optimised-Interesting story with detailed backstories found in game-Good UI and item management systemNegative features:-Occasional backtrackingTo conclude Dead space is a great game with a combination of horror and action, a classic, that deserves a play for any fan of survival horror and even new comers who are brave enough to try it.

★★★★★This game is about to be 10 years old. If you never found a chance to play it, just try and do it. Same goes with the arguably better Dead Space 2.This first installment is really well designed. To the enemies, the hud, the varied gameplay, the hallways (look at my profile for some screenshots of these), the combat, it looks like the team thought it all out and took the right amount of care for it. The only cliché you can't ignore while playing this, are the blood-written texts on the wall, which is since then overused by today indie developers.I should notify buyers that the devs never fixed the flashing lights issue when you play on unlimited FPS. It's not an huge issue, especially since its mostly only in the first chapter (of 12). The mouse sensitivity also doesn't work as desired at first since it's really low. Their are some easy work-arounds, and if you don't want to deal with that, you can always play with a (xbox one) controller.One serious con with this PC version is the lack of achievements, which were a joy to hunt on the 360/PS3 version. Nevertheless, it's a great game. Pick it up when its on sale, because it's often discounted with 50%.			"

												Dead Space is a survival horror game. You are slow moving with jump out and scare you moments. The character Issac controls slow and clunky. Plus your character Issac Clark takes up a lot of the screen, which I guess happens in a lot of over the shoulder shooters. You want to see what's behind you. Since this is an over the shoulder shooter, things can easily sneak up on your left side, even more so than behind you.The game drips with atmosphere, horror and gore, but it doesn't feel scary. Maybe I'm just used to horror games, or maybe its the fact when you run through a dead enemy, you kick it like a soccer ball and it flops like a rag doll fish. That's probably why Doom 3 had its dead enemies burn into nothing. With Dead Space, the idea is that enemies can still be alive... when they look dead. The game looks awesome and makes great use of lighting and shadow. You won't be in dark areas so much as dim areas with lights shining through vents. It has a great look to it.Dead Space boasts strategic dismemberment, such as first cutting off a leg of an enemy, before you cut off its head. If you cut off its head, it will blindly swing at you. If you cut off its leg, it will crawl and lunge at you. Most enemies are like this. Other enemies might explode with smaller, more annoying enemies if you're inaccurate. There are also reanimating enemies that take priority, because they'll monsterfy every dead body in the room. So if you're the type of gamer that likes aim over put more bullets into it, this game is for you! The enemies will even work their way through vents if you've gone to another room and they'll pop out. The vents are pretty easy to spot, but a lot of vents are on the ceiling. There are four major weapons in the game, the line cutter, flame thrower, plasma rifle and some sort of saw gun. It is unfortunate that you'll end up primarily using the weapon you start with for the entire game. That feels like a wasted opportunity. The flame thrower feels extremely weak if not completely useless.You're able to collect items, like health, ammo, air canisters for when you're walking in space and its all contained in your limited inventory. When you upgrade your 'rig' (suit), you can carry more stuff, but for the most part, since everything is sellable, you'll rarely run out of room. As the game starts, there is plenty of ammo, but at around six hours in, ammo gets scarce, but you can still buy more. Lack of ammo comes from missing vulnerable points of enemies and having them explode into smaller points.You'll also pick up node modules to upgrade things and if you start upgrading your line cutter, then why would you ever switch to a different weapon? Plus, any ammo that you get for other weapons, you can just sell at one of the game's stores for credits that you can use to buy more line cutter ammo. There are locked rooms that you can use a node to get into, but since nodes are one of the most valuable and costly items in the game, it might not be worth the risk to see what's in the mystery room. You'll also be able to explore and find items in cabinets, lockers and smashable boxes, but you really can't wander too far off the beaten path.Traversing the USG Ishimura feels like there is plenty of back tracking, with some getting lost. Luckily there is a 3D slightly difficult to use map. For the most part, each level is contained into branching segments, you'll start at the root of the map tree, clear out one branch and all of its limbs, end up at the root / hub of the level, then go for the next branch area. Sadly some of the 'chapters' reuse levels. The USS Ishimura is a big space ship, and I would call it similar to Metroid-Vania-ish since you'll revisit areas of a ship, but its all broken into 'chapters' that you can't return to unless its in the storyline to return to that section.There are some puzzles, but nothing major. You'll get powers like telekinesis to move objects and a slow down stasis to solve puzzles and get through areas. Without the puzzles, the game seems easy even on normal difficulty.The game has a very painful key binding system, especially for lefties. While you can rebind keys, you can't rebind all keys, so I recommend just using a controller. The controller works great and has simple controls for a complex system. You've got buttons for run, inventory, aim, stomp (to downed enemies and boxes), melee attack (which seems useless), use button and the D-pad will call your 4 weapons to switch. When you're aimed at something, you can reload, fire your weapon. alt-fire, use telekinesis or stasis to slow anything down.Thankfully save points and checkpoints are everywhere. It keeps the game progressing, but another negative of the game is when you run out of ammo or health and just can't pass a section, you're locked into that section. When you're stuck, you've got two choices, run all the way back to a store at the start of a level, or sometimes you might just have to restart from a save point. This is why I can understand EA's desire to throw micro transactions into the game. If you get stuck with no ammo, no credits and only have 1 save file, you might literally have to restart the game. When you get 10+ hours in, that will kill your desire to play.In all, the game feels good to play, despite how slow it is. If you enjoy typical space horror with the plot of Aliens, this game is for you! The game has been $5 on Steam and free on Origin. Chances are if you wait, there will be a sale, a bundle or a free download.			"

												I have played Dead Space across three separate platforms (PS3, XB360 and PC) clocking in over 300+ hours. One might say I have an obsession with the series and I can say with certainty that this game is worth buying, especially during a salePositives:- A compelling story which begins the epic franchise that has spanned 5 games (including Extraction and Dead Space IOS), 2 movies, 2 novels and 2 graphic novels- Fully immersive game mechanics. No HUDs, no pause while looking through inventory, all character data is displayed on Isaac Clarke's RIG in real-time, all 'cut scenes' happen in real time- Diverse weapons each with a primary and secondary fire mode, plus two tools to help in combat; Kinesis, which allows you to pick up and hurl objects; and Stasis, which slows enemies and dangerous objects- A terrifying and grotesque foe who are as varied as they are aggressive, who are capable of tactical adaption- Zero Gravity environments that change the dynamics of gameplay and how you fight- Rich and detailed environments with atmospheric ambient noises and music- New Game + which allows you to carry on your fight with all your previous gear and upgrades- The option to run game higher than 30fps on PC - please see below for issues howeverNegatives:- The port is not without faults. You are either locked to 30fps or, by disabling Vsync, unlimited fps but with physics issues- Poor M/KB compatibility and what appears to be command delay for controllers- Linear gameplay that begins to stagnate after one or two playthroughs- New Game + does not allow you to change difficulty level- DLC available on console absent from Steam. While not necessary I dislike content exclusivitySolutions:- Both of the first two negatives can be fixed, please consult the Steam Forum for solutionsConclusion:An absolute must for fans of great third person action games but especially for fans of Horror. Horror is a niche market in video games these days with fewer and fewer contributions to its genre. This might be from a previous generation of games but it still stands tall with the best of them in my opinion			"

""It's strange... such a little thing.""- Nicole BrennanSome games are what you'd call inspired. Others wear their inspirations on their sleeves. Then there's the games that are just their inspirations.Dead Space manages to be the latter, and still be more than the sum of its parts.Dissecting its frankenstein nature, you'll find a setting that's 3 parts Event Horizon, 1 part Alien, with enemy types from The Thing, with gameplay straight from RE4 and colour filters straight from the Discount Cellophane Garbage Disposal. EA Redwood, now Visceral, adds something to this derivative slurry, and that's commitment. Sheer belief in a butcher's vision carries Dead Spare where so many of its peers have failed. The dedication to aesthetic - where absolutely every player interaction and HUD is justified and explained ingame - if nothing else adds one metric hell of an aesthetic. One of videogame's best GUIs is joined by some remarkably decent levels, that's never too mazelike nor too streamlined, which breakneck pacing sees you speeding through to great production values and lab-brewed SFX that manages to make lazer guns - traditionally the most pew pew of weapons - hit hard and hit heavy.""Make us whole again.""- About half the NPCsEnemy variety is much more than you'd expect. You have your worthless mook, your ranged mook, your fast mook, your faster mook, your fat pregnant tank mook who'll explode into a horde of ""Up yours"" fleshbugs who treat your health bar like candy while calling you Daddy, and a couple of minibosses besides.You're given enough tools and mechanical aptitude that no situation feels like it's forcing you to take damage. From your comically-overpowered stasis to begin able to sprint backwards, to that every shot hitstuns an enemy for more than enough time to get past it, it hits all the right marks.But post-industrial blood-splattered wonderland that Dead Space is, it's certainly not perfect.The bosses suck. Shoot the big yellow glowing points at a midranged distance on our generically gory-looking fleshblobs. I'm fairly sure at least two of them are impossible without the hitscan weapons.Speaking of which, half the weapons are absolute garbage. Sure, Line Gun, Pulse Rifle, Plasma Cutter, more than carry the game. But the Flamethrower and Disc Ripper are infamously awful, with the Force Gun not lagging far behind. The divide in usefulness is so wide it boggles the mind how this reached final release.""I will leave you with my child.""- Dr. Mercer before unleashing Dead Space's NemesisThe incentives to play multiple times are also pretty thin. There's not enough ability to explore or to deviate from the norm to really justify just going through again, the bonuses that exist are just there to make an already easy game easier. Although there's Impossible Mode, which is nice if you like only using the Plasma Cutter ever and having enemies sidestep enough to star in a Thriller video.Most ingrained problem of all, though, is that the actual horror aspects just aren't very good. It mostly just amounts to enemies jumping out of vents - only vents - and screaming you in typical monster closet fashion, which is hack talk for ""please be scared"". Although some people couldn't finish the game due to being too scared, so what do I know.Now, this is a PC port. And not a fantastic one. The control issues are fairly infamous, and even once you apply the fixes it's fairly janky to get used to. Disable V-Sync, jack mouse sensitivity to full, navigate menus with keyboard only, treat actually aiming like ironsights and you have a setup, that while it takes some getting used to, makes the game a fair bit easier than it ought to be.There's a couple of inherent quirks - not being able to strafe diagonally, or that you can't initiate a reload while walking but it's fine to walk while reloading. Odd little details like that, that once you adjust to aren't an issue. Certainly not insurmountable issues for a PC port, and this is a PC port worth playing.""Cut off their limbs.""- wall graffiti, followed by an audio log, followed by an ingame conversation, followed by a tutorial promptDead Space is a mechanically-decent aesthetically-driven game that has a dream, or at least a nightmare, to share and does it well. It's definitely worth your time.			"

												A classic example of atmospheric horror that will, surely, stand the test of time and remain as one of the best horror games,  and one of the best sci-fi games, I've ever played. I have a lot to talk about for this one kiddies, so grab some popcorn or something. I won't spoil anything for you either, so don't worry about that, if you haven't beaten the game yetSOUND:____First and foremost: One of the most important pieces of any horror game is effective sound design. I didn't notice it as much on my first playthrough, sadly, because I only played in Stereo, but I went back recently and replayed the whole game in Surround Sound, high volume, with headphones, and oh boy, did I have a lot of pants to replace. Players aren't going to jump if a group of Necormorphs ambush them while the Betty Hill theme is playing in the background, likewise, the whispers you can hear throughout the ship wouldn't be as effective if they were accompanied by a vuvuzuela. In that sense, this game exceeds all expectations. They use just the right sound, every click, inhuman gurgle, and automated announcement falls so perfectly into place that you'll surely be looking over your shoulder.Again, to experience this, play at high volume with surround sound headphones. I guarantee you, the difference in fear is like night and day. On my first playthrough with just stereo, that I did years ago, I didn't even flinch once at any scares, on my most recent playthrough, with surround sound, I cried at least five times.The soundtrack is scary enough that even listening to it out of the game makes me feel like I should be on edge, looking over my shoulder. Beautiful composition, that fits perfectly with the world established by the game.The sound aspect of Dead Space scores a 10/10 from me. Suberb job, every audio-design student should play this at least once to see how much of an effect using sound correctly can have on a person's experience. It's the difference between confidently strolling down a corridor and hesitantly walking down it, moving your legs oddly as your legs are soaked in fear-urine.____GRAPHICS:___By graphics, I don't mean 'oh look how high-definition this texture is!"", I feel like people put too high of a value on that. A game can have 1080p textures and still look like digital vomit. No, what I mean is how appealing a game looks, the over-all design and how it flows together, immersing you.Dead Space's graphics are as good as the sound: They make you paranoid, even. The subtle way the gray hallways seem to endlessly blur together, mixed with the scratching of something following you, will make most people, myself included, feel intensely claustrophobic. It's beautiful how every texture, every object, seems to flow into eachother, all of them playing into the theme that 'I really, REALLY shouldn't be here"". From the uncanny way the monsters still retain 'just' enough of their human appearance, to the way certain vents blend into the floor so you can't tell a monster may pop out, to the way the lighting may be just dim enough you dread the idea something may pop out, Dead Space has got you covered.The Ishimura feels like a real ship, every deck feels just unique enough, yet consistent enough you can tell it's part of the same ship. It serves to further create an atmosphere of tension and loneliness.Dead Space's graphics get a 10/10.____GAMEPLAY:____Dead Space's gameplay is superb, but not a 'perfect' experience by any means. There are both pros and cons to the resource management. While at times it can correctly make situations more tense, at other times it just raises my blood pressure and makes me want to punch my monitor.It's a mixed bag as far as resource management goes, while the combat remains fairly standard. It's a point, click, you're dead kind of deal, with very little variation between the best ways to dispatch monsters. There isn't much to say about the gameplay, it's average. 7/10.___STORY (No Spoilers: Don't worry)___I'm going to be vague here to avoid spoiling anything, but the story of Dead Space is an emotional rollercoaster, and I craved more, and more as time went on. I was truly interested in fully understanding what went on on the Ishimura, and learning all I could about the crew who manned her. Furthermore, seeing how the characters interacted actually played out quite nicely, and their treatment of eachother was rather realistic. I myself have seen work environments where people act like that in real life, so it was refreshing to see actual human-like characters.The mystery, suspense, and all out dread is flawless. It has an odd balance where not knowing what's happening is horrifying, but understanding exactly what's happening is JUST AS SCARY. It's a weird trait that I don't see too often in horror games anymore. Most of the time, when you learn the mechanics behind the monsters in a horror game, their motives, their origins, it removes some fear, it grounds them into a Earthly point of view where you can try to understand. But in Dead Space, it's like the more you understand the more otherworldly your situation truly seems. It'll keep you on the edge of your seat. This is a game where you HAVE to read all the text logs and listen to the audio-logs, or else you'll miss a big chunk of the experience, and believe me when I say all of the video/audio/text logs are written well enough that they're juicy and will leave you pondering them. Dead Space has one of my favorite game universes of all time, and for that the story gets a 10/10.___OVERALL:___Overall, Dead Space is a stellar (Heh, see what I did there?) example of a truly genius execution of the decades old concept of being stranded in space with monsters all around. May Dead Space long live as an example to both the sci-fi and horror game developer and player communities as an example of when things are done right. For decades to come, I imagine Dead Space will still stand as one of the best horror games ever made, and THE best horror game franchise that EA's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t marketing ever ruined.9.9/10And remember, there's always Peng.

AND MAKE SURE TO TURN OFF THE IN-GAME V-SYNC, and enable v-sync in your amd/nvidia control center, AND USE A XBOX-360 CONTROLLER! TRUST ME.Cons to this game: No achievements, Mouse+Keyboard controls suck.			"

												This game is truly a horror masterpiece. The special about it is that Isaac isn't a soldier trained to kick ♥♥♥ but an engineer trained for fixing stuff. Going into a battle for survival against aggressive Necromorphs is always a terrifying experience. Do yourself a favor by playing Dead Space only in a dark room with headphones to experience the true horror. The only part I dislike about it is that it makes you feel edgy almost all the time knowing that danger lies around every corner.P.S. Playing the game with a controller is strongly recommended (for smoother aiming) and also please choose hard difficulty.GG!			"

												Dead Space can be considered a modern classic for survival horror genre or just a bland sci-fi shooter with horror elements. What ever you might think, you can admit that this game does have a decent gameplay and good atmosphere at some points. Weapons and armor look cool and are indeed memorable. Killing necromorphs is fun and sci-fi weapons make it even more fun. The game still does have a fair share of issues. PC version has poor performance for relatively old game and is buggy, but the amount bugs in play sessions changes. I had a invisible wall when I opened the door (at the first chapter in fact) and I couldn't get through, so I had to change some settings (I can't remember what I did, but you can find out yourself) to fix it. Another bug was in zero-gravity outside the ship where there was asteroids hitting the ship and you had to avoid those by getting into cover. You also had to jump to the walls because of cover and oxygen canisters, but my character somehow didn't land on it and stopped and died for no reason. I had to land much more carefully to avoid it. When I was a bit younger I stopped playing it because of this issue. I didn't understand, what I was suppose to do at the time.WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!  This game does have a story which has a lot of clichees. Characters aren't that good and it doesn't help that your main character, Isaac Clarke, is mute. They added voice later on with the sequels gladly, but his personality wasn't that interesting, but still OK. I should still say that the foundation of Dead Space is great. Humanity is lacking resources and for that reason, they built planetcrackers that can go into lightspeed and then grab a huge part of the planet/moon/asteroid to mine it and gather all the resources. There's also a cult with large amounts of members who have their own devious plans. Good setup, but the story of characters is lacking and could've been better.  If you're new to horror genre, this game might be scary to you. Though it's possible that if you're an active gamer, you'll notice the patterns in Dead Space. This review might sound too cynical to have a recommended status, but I should say that this game is good overall and you should try it if you're into shooters or horror.I wrote this review because I didn't have anything else to do, so it might be a bit messy. I do hope that my review was readable and easy to understand.(As always, I might do mistakes when writing text in english, so apologies for any mistakes I made)			"

												Dead Space is an action oriented survival horror game.You are Isaac Clarke, an engineer that is part of a rescue team. Your mission is to repair the spaceship USG Ishimura, a huge mining vessel that carves out chunks from planets and harvests the valuable ore. Shortly after they arrive on board all hell breaks loose. Their craft is destroyed, leaving them stranded on the Ishimura. The crew is attacked by nightmarish creatures. Seperated from the others it is up to Isaac to wander the halls, search for any friends or survivors that are still alive and fix as many problems as he can until he can find a way to escape the ship.The setting is where the game shines. It definitely feels like you are in deep space. There are sections in a vacuum, things sound differently as you would expect if you were in an airless environment. You also have a small air supply that will run out if you are not quickly. There are other parts where there is no gravity and you can leap from floor to ceiling or walk up the sides of a wall. A cool aspect is that there is no HUD. Health is displayed on the back of your suit and ammunition is displayed when you hold up your weapon. Another interesting feature is the holographic screens that appear throughout the ship and when someone is talking to you. All elevators and doors have one of these screens instead of a standard switch. The graphics are good. It has great lighting effects, textures, and models.The sounds also really help with the immersion. You will sometimes hear random clanking, footsteps, or alien grunts and shrieks that keep you on your toes. The music gets intense when you are under attack by a group of aliens and is kind of spacey when you are just exploring alone. Overall, if you like blood, gore, horror and action you should try Dead Space. There might be too much action in this game for the old school survival-horror fans but it should still be ok for them.Sounds 9/10Graphics 9/10Gameplay 9/10Atmosphere 10/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												Overall score = 8/10Dead Space is a wonderful game combining many genres, third person shooter, survival, action, and horror, all into on. While some games fail when trying to do too much, Dead Space is able to do all of these parts well and deliver a satisfying experience from start to finish.Dead Space progresses very nicely from start to finish. The story is intriguing and, while horrifying space creatures is nothing new, presents a well rounded and detail/lore filled experience that took some thought to follow. The opening sequence leads very nicely right into the action, immediately making you want to find out just what happened to that ship. As far as firefights go, this game offers some intense sequences. Whenever I overcame a hoard of enemies I felt like a badass, but I always hoped that an engagement like that wouldn't happen again. This may be what Dead Space does best: present you in an environment that makes you uncomfortable, leave you feeling exposed at all times, and give you just enough to get the job done if you do it right and think on your feet. That being said, I found the biggest flaws in the game to also center around the combat situations. While there are plenty of action sequences in the game, it is not as smooth as other action games, which is of course fine as this isn't the initial purpose. However, some sequences and enemies felt cheap to me when you meet them. The enemies are varied, challenging, and interesting as a whole, but some sequences are downright frustrating. Often this happens when an objective is not fully clear or your purpose is not adequately explained. I don't expect a game to hold my hand, but when it isn't clear what that button you just pressed does, but swarms of enemies come out of the vents, it can become exhasperating. Fortunately, this doesn't happen too often.The progression system in Dead Space is very good and rewarding. You can build your loadout to your playstyle and upgrade equipment to suit your strengths. Dead Space offers a variety of weapons to use and tactics to implement to keep battles fresh and fun.I would definitely recommend Dead Space, even though it is a few years old. It is still a great game, and at a discount during Christmas or summer for $5 simply can't be missed.			"

												Who is this Game For?==================Fans of Horror, puzzling stories and third person shooting will find a lot to like about Dead Space. The story in Dead Space is one of its strong points. It tells a great cinematic sci-fi action horror tale. You can definitely see the inspiration from films such as Event Horizon, Aliens and The Thing.Is it good?=================A lot of this atmosphere is due to the brilliant sound effects. The voice acting is good, but it's the background noise that really gets to you. Hearing monsters crawling around the air vents, or the growling of something possibly watching you, all adds to the level of tension and fear - especially during the quieter moments in the game, or outside the ship in the emptiness of space. The graphics help, too - this is a very impressive looking game with excellent lighting.Does it have any problems?========================Another thing that starts to kill the scare factor is the few times when you run into other people still alive (usually not for long) on the ship. These are always scripted sequences where you find someone and almost at that exact moment they either kill themselves (they've clearly gone nuts) or get killed by something else. This is fine a few times, but after a while, it's just a bit much and starts feeling too convenient and a little bit fake.As for PC ports go, it’s not the worst, but it does have its problems. There are problems with mouse lag, and running the game at higher frame rates. A lot of people still report audio shudder and crashing at desktop. All these problems can be fixed with a bit of tinkering (http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Dead_Space) but I would still recommend playing the game with a controller.Final Thoughts!====================Dead Space is one of best Survival Horror releases in years. Tense, violent and incredibly aggressive; playing it at night with a loud 5.1 sound system can provide you the most spectacular scare moments of your life. It is a potentially great game that's hamstrung by an attempt to completely ape a console controller with a mouse and keyboard. "

Teal DeerDevelopers: EA Redwood Shores Publishers: Electronic Arts Initial release: Oct 2008Genre: Action, Horror#Worth/NotWorth: #WorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationDead Space is a horror game. In where you play as our reluctant and intrepid hero Issac Clarke, a technician. Sent to the USG Ishimura, a Planet-Cracker class ship designed for mining. Upon arrival, Issac and friends have a bit of a tift actually docking with the Ishimura. After avoiding near death almost immediately upon introduction. We find ourselves upon the ship ready to get to work; Only no one is responding to our radio hails. Entrance into the first room, we are attacked by monsters later given the name Necromorphs and being the consummate professional that Issac is we decide to continue to repair the ship regardless of it's now infested alien presence. And so it begins...It's not a terribly in depth game. It is indeed your basic walk through hallways and shoot anything that moves sort of affair. But it's an effective and atmospheric one even still today. Is it contrived that in a world that requires you to dismember enemies you're given a plasma cutter that is effective at range and presumably your character would know not only how to use  it but an expert in his field? Yes, it is. The story is more in depth, I feel, than most horror. Creating a universe rather than “an experience”. Without saying anything specific, the game makes commentary on the frivolity of desperation in the creation of a new religion based almost exclusively on not knowing something. The game does feature what I'd consider “insanity effects” but they are more scripted than ambient. Throughout the game Issac does not speak. Sometimes awkwardly not saying anything but mostly this is reminiscent of the Gordon Freeman effect wherein it allows the player to place themselves more into the role. Now, at this point I should mention this is my 3rd play-through of this game and that I have also completed the rest of the trilogy. The series takes a direction that I am both happy with and thought could have been better. But that is neither here nor there. This is the beginning of that adventure. Mechanically, it's a shooter with a camera made popular by Gears of War and Resident Evil 4. It was also made in a time that “immersion” was all the rage. The HUD appears entirely “in-game” meaning that all feedback normally given to the player (Health, power for abilities, ammo count, inventory) are all made visible in-world to the characters themselves. You collect power nodes used for upgrading either your suit or weapons. The big mechanically unique thing regarding this game is the Zero-gravity areas. They are interesting, at the time they may have been more impressive but they stand to be a pretty standard element. Sound design is excellent, walking into the vacuum of space is always an incredible feeling hearing only the muffled shuffles within your own suit.Now, there is a section of this game that is borderline game breaking. It's one of the more egregiously needless frustrating sections of a game I've ever seen. Which incidentally speaks volumes to the rest of the game. I don't want to say exactly what it is, I get that it's supposed to be a stressful situation but I know a number of people that actually stopped playing the game because of that section. Addressing more topical issues, the game has full gamepad support and there is no issue with this. However, if you desire to use mouse and keyboard you'll notice that even at max sensitivity the controls are as though they are stuck in quickly hardening mud. (I used a 1600DPI mouse at max sensitivity and moved the mouse roughly 1ft actual space and turned about 90° in game) However, there is a simple solution to these issues. For whatever reason EA forgot to and didn't patch the fact the game V-sync doesn't include the mouse (console ports huh), so you'll have to force enable it through the video card control panel. The v-sync works as expected otherwise. THE GISTAtmospheric, weight-y and  heavy combat with a great narrative universe.Follow my curation for more "

												In my opinion, Dead Space is one of the best horror/shooter games out there, with just the right amount of atmosphere and jump scares. It focuses on a unique dismemberment mechanic, and trying to cut off enemiess legs while they charge you is always a rush. This game is more the spiritual successor to System Shock than Bioshock, which uses an upgrade system that makes your choices matter. There isn't as many utility skills as System Shock, but which weapons you choose to level up with your very limited upgrade nodes changes your playstyle. Just a few flaws specific to the Steam version: mouse acceleration is terrible in this game and you can't disable it within the settings. There's a fix you can download from pcgamingwiki which makes it bearable again, but it still feels off, especially using the mouse in menus. Also, once the mouse is fixed, the precision aiming makes the game much easier than intended. I originally played this on the 360 and I recall it being much more difficult. Enemies that would take 4-5 shots now go down in 2 well-placed shots, which also makes ammo too abundant. Still, it's a great game that aged well in the nearly decade it's been out.			"

Even nowadays I can easily fall into the spirit of dark and scary corridors of USG Ishimura and get my atmospheric gameplay and a lot of content for creation of my own way of struggle. I am very sure that even after some years, it will be very interesting for me to replay this game and relive its experience again.			"

												I bought the game as a bundle with the second one. I was hoping to play through them both but unfortunately for me and apparently for many others the controls on the PC port are completely broken, there is extreme input lag unless you turn v-sync off, the mouse sensitivity is excruciating low and has negative acceleration, meaning I literally couldnt turn a corner unless i picked up my mouse and moved it across the pad several times. Even with the fixes on the forums that require you alter the files for the game, I experienced freezes in the mouse controls, and glitches with the movement. Finally I hit an invisible wall in the only path forward, meaning I had to quit the game before even the first save point. I didn't bother to try to sit through the unskippable opening cutscene again.Luckily when i went ahead to the second game I found that none of these problems persisted and I was pleasantly surprised with extremely fluid controls and movement animations. I would only buy this game if you are looking to play through the whole series, because it is likely your game will be broken and you will have to jump through hoops to actually play it. If you are just looking for a bit of the dead space experience skip this one and go for number 2.			"

												EDIT: I bought a Xbox 360 controller and this game works perfectly with it. While this is good news it still does not change the fact that this game sucks with KB/M. Also to anyone who disagrees with me, please post a comment telling me why.This review is for the PC version only. I love this game, and have played it all the way through around four times. In my opinion, this game has one of the best horror atmospheres ever. Although its almost all jump scares, it kept me on my toes the entire game. The story was good enough to keep me entertained, and the use of audio logs was amazing. Nothing really wrong with the base game, a perfect jump-horror game. My HUGE issue with the PC port is the horrid control issues. Even on max sensitivity, it would take entire seconds to turn the camera around, and only through notepad tweaking could I make it bearable. This ""solution"" would ultimately create a form of mouse acceleration, so the movement was still not smooth. V-Sync is horribly tied into this game, which I believe is what causes this issues. Please buy this amazing game, but on a console, and tell the developers to stop putting out unacceptable PC ports.Pros:+Loads fastNegatives:-Absolutely unplayableOverall: 1/10 Do NOT buy this version, but please get it on console. This is one of my favourite horror games ever made, and it truly saddens me to give it such a low score, but this port absolutely sucked.			"

												I'm never touching this bloody game again. It made it hard to sleep for two nights because of how awesome/intense it is. You never get a break from the terror. You wanna walk around that corner? Make sure you're reloaded. You wanna open that door? Better aim and take a step back. Death can come from anywhere, and you're always low on health and ammo. It's not scary like typical horror games. It doesn't need jumpscares or anything like that. The incredible atmosphere of the game is enough to keep you terrified for the whole ride.

About halfway through I became a powerhouse and was just mowing down enemies. It has some puzzles in it that were solved quickly but brought a good change of pace when needed. The zero gravity rooms were cool and also disorienting. The checkpoints were very forgiving. If you can get it for 5 bucks when it is on sale it is very worth it. 8/10			"

												Fun, scary and intense! Half the time Im so anxious looking for whats coming around the next corner. This game keeps you on your toes and weapons aimed ready because enemies come from all different directions. Different strategies/weapons for different enemies is refreshing, instead of just blasting away you have to take off their limbs. Great graphics, atmosphere and sound surrounds you and puts you smack in the middle of its eerie environment. The gameplay, weapons and upgrade system are done really well giving good replay value.

												Do you want to be a badass?-Do you want kill %&#@?!-Do you want to wander aimlessly for hours finding parts to build your own damn gun!?! -Want to fix things?!If you answered yes to any of these questions, then this is the game for you!( In all honesty though, This game series is honestly of my favorites.  It has a great story and the games are pretty good when it comes to the horror aspect of things. Even for the age of the games they are still worth playing and hell i'd play through them again and again. ) 10/10***** "

												I'm not new to Dead Space. I got this game back when it came out for PS3 and it since then become one of my most loved franchises to have ever existed. Everything about this game was so perfect and back in the days, never seen in a game before. It mixed sci-fi with horror in such a way that movies like Alien and Predator could only do. Being the early 80's child that I am, this brought many smiles of joy, as well as screams of terror.I will not go much into detail, since most people who play this will be familiar with the game, wether they played it for Xbox or PS3. This game hasn't aged too well though. With so many masterpieces of the horror franchises out there, like Outlast and even the sci-fi brother Alien Isolation, Dead Space somehow does not feel too scary anymore. Not to say it's bad, but when you play Alien Isolation and then start Dead Space right after, you are not into it for the scares, but for the nostalgia.Nevertheless, Dead Space is a masterful game. So original that not many (or any) games could copy or surpass it, unless of course, we look at Dead Space 2. But I'm leaving that for another review.So moving on to the technical details:Graphics: -Playing this at 1080p on a GTX970 paired with an i5 6600k with 10% OC, running at 60fps with all settings maxed out. I can't say it looks great... It is 100x smoother than the PS3 version, yes, but that kind of hurts the game a bit since it makes the old and blurry textures stand out. The PS3 version was a lot darker, more grainy and the 30fps helped with the ""cinematic"" feel. Maybe it was my imagination. maybe back then this game looked great since there wasn't anything better.One th epossitive: Light effects are a lot sharper though, and the holographic menu looks gorgeous!Sound:-As wonderful and nerve-wrecking as I rememberControls:-Now this is where the game suffers terribly. This game on a keyboard and mouse is a no-go. Playing it with an Xbox One controller does help, but the analogs are way too sensitive compared to the absolute perfection that the Dual Shock 3 analogs were. I don't remember this game being this clunky (maybe it was), but now it is very bad. It will need some getting used to, but it will certainly won't stop me from enjoying.Story:-Very engaging, original, great character that you'll learn to love. It's like a good sci-fi B movie. It also takes some inspiration from the Alien franchise.Setting:-The sci-fi lore here is very good. I am an amature sci-fi novelist and it is absolute bliss to play this game for all those little science details. Even if some strech reality a bit, without getting too far from what it is possible.Replay value:-Not much to see here really. THis is a game you play once in a while.Port quality:-WARNING READ THIS: A lot of people complain of crashing, lag and glitchy v-sync. Be aware that this game does not play well on all systems. However there are a lot more people like me that are having absolutely NO problems with this game even maxed out. still, if you go for it and do experience problems, there are tons of threads here in the Steam community of fixes and setting combos that will certainly make the experience much more enjoyable.10/10 One of those great games that will forever be remembered in the gaming industry. Godly sequel, and even if the end of the trilogy wasn't too great (game-wise), it gave a spectacular finale to the hero that Isaac Clarke is.			"

												This is an amazing game. It has borrowed some of the mechanics from Bioshock, but it is nowhere near a ""Bioshock in space"". Where bioshock has offered you a wierd and twisted sense of dementia, this game offers a cold hard fictional reality of deep space. It is gritty, dirty and bloody in right amounts. It gives you that feeling of palpable reality that you can almost taste. If you are a fan of Event Horizon, Alien etc, you will love this game.The camera is over the shoulder 3rd person, which adds to the atmosphere of something lurking just behind your back and you not being able to clearly see it. One of the greatest additions, which I want to see in all games from now on is the complete integration of GUI into the game world. There is no button that takes you out of the game, everything you do, whether browsing your inventory or checking your map is done within the world. All readings like health, air etc are integrated into your suit so you have nothing that detaches you from the world. It is amazing how an apparently simple thing as that can add to the game atmosphere.Without giving too much away the game begins with you and a crew of astronauts on course to investigate a distress beacon from a stricken spaceship, and you guessed it all hell has broken loose when you arrive. You find yourself from the very beginning isolated from your crew forced to stumble your way through the eerie and downright terrifying tunnels and rooms of the stricken ship.And the atmosphere is scary, confined and claustrophobic. Parts where you go to 0G are downright disorienting in a right way, being that you are able to walk on ceilings and walls, you can easily lose the feeling of what is up and what is down. "

Dead Spaceis the best Horror Game I played 9 years ago!Its strange the game is 9 years Old and still kicking! Pros and Cons  Liked Hated   Best Space Concept and Planetary View. The Game is Scripted, which means that the people you like in the game dies anyway and there is no way or choice to save them.   Alot of Jumpscares and you Probably think twice before going into an unknown location. The Game becomes more easy after Completing the first round.   Psychic Horror. Nicole was Dead all along.  The Game is very likely to be considered similar to Capcom's Resident Evil 4 Slow Controls Senstivity and Low FPS, you have to manually Disable V-sync to get 60+ Frames.  You will get 60+ Frames. There is No way to Lock the Frames at 60 FPS. "

												This game is really gawdamn scary and very atmospheric. I wouldn't play it wearing headphones if somebody paid me. Mixed emotions run rampant as you are titillated by how cool the Sci-Fi aspect is while at the same time sh!ting your pants because there are creepy-♥♥♥ aliens coming at you around every corner and the desire to cry and seek comfort in the fetal position. Game play for me goes like this: Ooooh cool Sci-Fi stuff - get objective - head to objective - omg what is that sound - omfg I can hear them -OMFG what was that movement out of the corner of my eye -  Aaah AAAH AAAH AAAHF#CKB@STARD Aaahah - frantic shooting - frantic camera panning -  Aaah AAAH AAAH AAAHF#CKB@STARD Aaahah - frantic shooting - frantic camera panning -  Map - Run like you stole something to the closest save point - Save - Exit and watch baby animal videos on YouTube to recover - play again tomorrow because that adrenalin rush is damn addictive and the game is really cool.The sadistic voice in my head wants to get this for all the people I 'love' <3			"

												Dead Space is a fun horror survival game I have owned numours times and enjoyed replaying. I first bought this game on the PS3 and put almost 2 days worth into playing it both for achievements and the experience. Dead Space's atmosphere is great and does a beautiful job of creating a spooky sci-fi horror on top of third person survival shooting. The game's story starts off as players playing as an engineer named Isac Clark who knows how to fix  EVERYTHING  and his team who were sent to fix a planet cracker ship called the Ishimurra. Clark's wife named Nicole was working on the Ishimurra untill something went wrong with their dig site and sent out a distress call for help. As Clark's team enters the Ishimurra they uncover the horrorfying necromorphs in the ship and try to desperatly escape. This game offers hours of fun from straight replayability to the experimenting with gear and tactics used to help you survive. The equipment in Dead Space is upgradable consisting of your suit (RIG), Stasis, Kenisis Module, and a total of 6 guns to use; 5 of them purchasable in game. These upgrades require nodes found in game or purchased at the store to upgrade their arsenal. In order to kill these necromorphs players are forced to shoot/cut thier limbs off instead of just shooting their head or torso bringing a new formula to survival shooting. Shooting thier legs off will only make them crawl towards players and shooting their heads off will make them swing wildly and aimlessly. The horror in this game is good and provides good jump scares even to people who replay the game. There are small mini games in Dead Space both rewarding prizes that aid the player in upgrading equipment or selling to the store. Dead Space is a great horror survival shooter with replayability both for higher difficulty and new game + to experiment with new weapons or simply play again with current equipment. I would not recommend purchasing this game on its own purchasing the Dead Space 1 & 2 bundle is a better price and more bang for your buck as the sequel is equally if not better than the original Dead Space.

												Dead Space is probably one of the best scifi action-horror games I've played. It has amazing atmosphere, visuals that still hold up, art design and interface design that blends awesomely and some of the best sound design ever. Firstly, if you get this game turn the music off. Yes, off. It has musical ques that while cool, give away there are enemies around/alive. If there's still some kind of music playing, you have a monster about. It ruins the atmosphere as great as the music is. You get a number of weapons that have alternate firing modes that make the game pretty damn replayable. All function differently and offer different pluses and minuses. Some people write this off as jumpscare the game, I say ...well yeah kinda. But that's fine since the tension matches the jumpscare. Stand idle in any area and listen. The sounds you hear, the creaking of the ship, the buzzing of electronics and the rustling of monsters really sets the mood. This game is the scifi-version of Resident Evil. You're trapped in a large place and have to deal with the hell onboard while dealing with limited supplies. You'll be running all over the ship doing tasks but things change as you go along, it's never dull. They keep things interesting. The interface is as I said, brilliant. There's no hud. All of Issac's gauges are on the back of his suit, or project from them, including the menus. It's really really well thought out and it keeps you focused on what's important, the center of the screen. Now on to the problems. This is a old PC game indeed, right when PC games were getting back on track with decent ports. This game is pretty good but I'm going to say some things that may break this game for you. Unless you change the game to have vsync every time you enter it, the game will lock at 30 if booted with vsync on. If you put vsync on after the game is on it'll lock to 60. However blasphemous as it sounds, you may prefer 30FPS since if you leave the framerate unlocked the mouse controls even at wildly high sensitivity levels are too slow to use. Also, the physics go haywire at above 30, killed enemies will bounce up and zero G bodies will start spinning like tornadoes. The crap mouse controls can be countered by using ....I'm gonna say it, a controller. Works perfectly with a XB360 or XB1 controller straight away. Which may not be ideal but it works. There could be a mod to fix this as well, I'm not sure. But I've played it with a controller and it's nice. Then again I've used controllers a bunch back in the PS2 days so I'm familiar with them. The last thing I noticed is if you jump in zero G at too narrow an angle, the game can bug out. <-this is avoidable. Even with these problems I still recommend it. You may have to use a controller or use a mouse at 30fps but it's still a fun game. I kinda link it with you're not supposed to be a badass shot, you're supposed to unused to shooting people/creatures. The sequel fared much better in terms of porting and is also a great game.			"

												Dead Space to me is like Super Mario 64 to my Nintendo machine.  I don't know how and why the Dead Space series has slipped over the years, but Dead Space 1 was always the best Dead Space and a genre defining game.  In fact, no one has really created a game where there are space zombies, you fight these things in space, combined with scare and horror with the dread of being alone.  You are truly alone in space.  Dead Space 2 was great too but no where as near as great as Dead Space.  It's one of those games that left an imprint in my recollection of gaming experiences along with Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Super Mario 64, Street Fighter, Goldeneye 64, Lost Odyssey, Valkyria Chronicles, Halo series, and a few others.  The Dead Space Universe is where the heart is.  There's vast potential.  The world of Dead Space is intriguing, and when well written, developed, and executed, it's the definitive space zombie game with a major twist.  But to call it space zombie is a hit from the hilt.  It's a lot more than that.  They're called necromorphs, and they're terrifying.  Horrific.  They terrorize your soul.The premise of Dead Space is overwhelming with potential possibilities that could bring the series back to life.  Dead Space 4, if it happens, will hopefully revisit the memories of the first game.  It's a must-play, sit in a dark room, with your headphones on video game.  Immerse yourself fully into its atmosphere and it will be one of the best times you've spent playing a game.Rating: 9.2 out of 10			"

												I like Alien Isolation but I have no respect for the main director Alistair Hope, this guy obviously knows sh*t about it and his team probably did all his work on his place. He said that ''horror and the survival genre"" were banalized by games like Dead Space (he meant the series) and the violence and action suffered with it. Well, tell me about banalization 21st Century Fox... Colonial Marines was your idea. I wish I could have said that publicly but better late than never, you and your publishers were just full of sh*t.Most games you play were later created after the engine firstly made to build it, ultimately leaving it with some limitations followed by many cuts of contents. ‎Wright Bagwell and Dead Space's main writters ‎Warren Ellis, Rick and Antony were the only guys at the time to have enough balls to go for the opposite direction creating the plot first then the engine later, based on the idea blowing the genre and changing industry's rules. Maybe that's why the scary jumpy moments still works to this date and why it feels so mature during every scene and event. Voice acting was/is absurdly good and it was probably the first game to take motion capture so seriously. Screams from the Necromorph are ridiculously well done. ""There is no scape"" feeling precedes that. Even if I dislike Dead Space 3 so much, the studio works can still be seen there. No, it shouldn't have been a first person, period. Ask about RE4 Shoulder Camera.It's incredible how those sci-fi machinery can look and feel dead serious to mess with. This constant feeling of ''I'm screw*d"" persists with everything you do and walk on. Game came out by 2008 so expect some clunky mechanics and outdated graphics, old ideas like non-voiced main character (later improved and evolved) but those were features made to last and it sure does its job which I'm still impressed. If you think I'm exaggerating, only after a time I came to know about a mind blowing secret from the game. By now you may already know about the bathroom thing, but I will blur it all here because it wasn't just there... It's actually scattered all around USG Ishimura.During the entire game some brillant form of subliminal voice and textures were running on the background and later on I came to know about the creepy whispers. They were so low you couldn't really hear or make sense out of it.  Now... this explain why the game was always scary even when nothing was happening. ID Software was reluctant to use those techniques on Doom 3, they were affraid about some Disney-like accusations but Eastwood Studios didn't gave a sh*t. The symbols on walls aren't just symbols, they're an actual hidden language. The fictious group Unithology is clearly messing with the real world Scienthology religion bullsh*t. When you find this out you start to realize the game isn't about biological weapons and that the enemy might be more darker in nature and origin. Answers should come after DS3 but the Dead Moon looked hellish, but not really from ... hell?  Since Dead Space 3 got the plot so f*ck*d up, we may never known anymore. The series are now indefinitely cancelled. EA broke further partneship with Valve so don't expect it here neither.There is no way to not recommend it good old times of horror that still lives here to be experienced for a ridiculous low price.EA is in the game? Nope.Just push the discharge button and make it flow within the sewer system. Every game EA puts her greedy hands on, they manage destroy it somehow. Friend, you don't need Dead Space 3. It's just some cool action game that failed to deliver the basics of survival... unless you like some loose gunner game rap*ng your fan love, forget it. Maybe mister Alister is right after all? DS3 is mainly a co-op game but If you're playing alone you will laugh at the character teleport on animation sequences. I won't ever recommend you DS3, it is simply a f*ck*ng joke with a very nice design. "

												Do you like space?  Do you like zombies?  Do you like fighting through wave after wave of faceless, terrifying enemies?  If so, this game is a must!Story:  9/10  As Isaac Clark, you get plunged into a desperate struggle for survival as you try to find a way off of the USG Ishimura, a deep-space mining ship that becomes infected with an alien parasite that turns corpses into vicious, mindless zombie things called Necromorphs.  You must fight your way through the ship, repairing key systems and unravelling the mysteries of the ship's mission.  The tory does a great job of keeping the tone of the game consistent throughout.  The whole time, you are seemingly one step behind, as you desperatley try to repair life support systems, engines, etc.  The problem I have with the story is the plot twist at the end, which I won't spoil.  Gameplay:  9/10  This game has one of the most creative combat systems I've come across in my many years of gaming.  It is, at its core, a third-person shooter, but not like the Mass Effect series where you run around guns ablaze.  To kill the necromorph enemies, you have to dismember them with your improvised weapons made from engineering tools.  You have to use your environment to your advantage.  The weapon upgrade system is very simple, yet rewarding.  As the game progresses, the enemies become more challenging to defeat, and require different strategies and weapons to beat.  Also, this game does a great job, in my opinion, of making boss battles.  They are simple and not too challenging (at least at easy difficulties), but I can't think of many modern games with actual boss battles.  Pretty much every level ends with one.  You also have at your disposal a stasis tool that sets anything it hits, wether it's an enemy or malfuntioning door, into slow-motion.  You also have a kinesis tool that allows you to grab things from afar and throw them.  You will have to use these things in conjunction to solve puzzles.Setting:  9/10  The USG Ishimura gets a little boring after a few levels, as everything kind of looks the same.  That being said, I'm a sucker for scientifically accurate space games.  Upon entering the vaccuum of space, you loose sound for the most part.  There are many places of zero-gravity, where you get to float around in dissorienting fashion.  The ship is creepy and almost archaic-looking, which fits the tone of the game very well.  The game has a few moments of horror, especially at the begining.  You pick up voice and text logs throughout the game, which add depth to the story.  Overall, I really enjoy this game.  It also has some nice replay value as it allows you to keep all of your weapons, with their upgrades, and your suit when you start a new game.  The story is also pretty fun the second time around because of the several plot twists you know about from the first play through.  The best thing about this game is the atmosphere it creates when you play it.  If you aren't playing with all of the lights turned off with sound-cancelling headphones, you aren't playing it right!

												I encountered the Tentacle Hentai monster after it came out of a dark corner and I ♥♥♥♥ myself. It grabbed my leg and dragged me down a bloody hallway with corpses that had been ripped open. That was the point where I shot it so many times that Jacket from Hotline Miami would go ""Damn!""After I shot it off I then got an explosive weapon and fired all of my ammo for it into the vent that it came from. I then got all of my other guns and used all of the ammo for them as well. I then had to walk down a dark hallway with no ammo as the most paranoid person in all of existence. Then I got stabbed by a necromorph. Then I realised I didn't save; the true horror of Dead Space.Possibly the best horror game I've ever played.			"

												***I originally wrote this review on 11-04-2008***Creating a successful horror game is tricky. There needs to be just enough of a blend tension, fear and scare tactics so the game does not fall to mundane generic enemies jumping out at players. Dead Space not only creates the one of the best atmospheres in a horror video game, it’s full of enough puzzles, frights and dilemmas to make even the most jaded 3rd Person Shooter player sit up and take notice. You play as Isaac Clarke, a space engineer, traveling to the USG Ishimura, a “Planet Cracker” which is emitting a distress call. After a tense opening sequence, Isaac boards the ship with his coworkers, Lt. Zach Hammond, security officer, and Kendra Daniels, a computer expert, and soon realizes this is no ordinary distress call as the ship has been overrun by an alien race. Isaac gets separated from his coworkers and must fight his way through the alien monsters to bring the ship back online and find a way off the Ishimura. Gameplay: Dead Space has taken every great piece of third person gameplay in the history of video games and combines it together to deliver an entertaining, enjoyable journey. You navigate Isaac from an over-the-shoulder view. There is no Heads Up Display (HUD) in Dead Space. Your health is indicated by the light meter embedded in the spine of your suit spine. Your ammo is displayed above your weapon when you aim and your stasis meter is also located on the back of your suit. What is stasis? It is a piece of technology that gives you the ability to slow down objects and enemies for puzzle solving and reaction time. You can recharge your stasis by accessing stations located throughout the ship or by finding portable stasis packs. Isaac also has the ability to use Kinesis, which allows him to move heavy objects or acquire objects that are out of reach. Stasis becomes available to Isaac a few minutes into the game, and Kinesis becomes available for use when entering the second chapter and has unlimited use.The game's most unique and striking appeal is operating in zero gravity or a vacuum. When entering a Zero-G zone, Isaac has the ability to jump from one side of the area to another. This opens up an new realm of puzzle solving and is some of the most fun sequences in the game. The enemies in Dead Space are deformed humans that were killed and turned into monsters by a race of alien creatures. There are a dozen or so different styles of enemies that navigate their way through the ships ventilation system, which means you may encounter an enemy at any given time. As many enemies as there are, they all can be taken out with the same technique: begin by shooting off their limbs first. Direct hits to the body will waste ammo, especially during fights with the tougher, more advanced enemies. Some of the more memorable enemies are the epic boss fights that also combine a little Zero-G action. The threats on the ship are sometimes not always enemy related. Dead Space shifts gears twice for a little Han Solo, “Don’t Get Cocky” turret action. So how do you take out all the enemies? With a wide range of weaponry of course. Isaac begins the game with a Cutter, an extremely accurate “laser” that fires a wide beam either horizontally or vertically. There are tons of lockers and chests to explore during the course of the game. Some lockers may contain ammo and others may contain credits, which can be used in Stores. At these Store locations, Isaac can store, ammo and items. Isaac is limited in the number of items he can carry, however the number of items can be increased if he upgrades his suit. Usually near by a store, is a Workbench, where Isaac can upgrade his weapons and gear.There is a lot of backtracking in Dead Space. At the beginning of each chapter, Issac exits a tram which carries passengers from one section of the ship to another, and at the end of each chapter he makes his way back to the same tram to journey to the next section of the ship. Isaac visits some sections of the ship more than once. There are tons of save points throughout Dead Space, probably more than there should be. Even if you don not save, Dead Space autosaves so much that you really do not have to save once through the entire game, unless you want to exit out of Dead Space or turn off your PS3. To make the game even easier, the developers also added in a feature that actually maps out the direction Isaac needs to travel to complete his next objective. This feature is displayed by a blue outline on the ground. (see pic below)The problem that most avid gamers will notice is that everything, aside from the zero gravity gameplay, has been borrowed from past films, novels, or other games. The over the shoulder view bares a striking resemblance to Resident Evil 4, the monsters are mere replicas of John Carpenter's The Thing, parallels in Event Horizon are seen throughout the entire game including some obvious set design rip offs and features in Doom 3 and System Shock are also used in Dead Space. It is at this point where we stop and think: are these references by the EA Readwood Game designers an homage to their favs or are they simply thefts? No matter, the similarities are not enough to take away from the Dead Space experience which delivers a terrifying story, but the influences are definitely obvious. Graphics and Sound:Dead Space does everything right graphically. It looks beautiful in full 1080p when staring out into the vast ocean of space, blowing an enemies head off, or playing through some beautiful level designs of what a 'Planet Cracker's' engine room, maintenance bay and mining section may look like. The sound effects are also top notch in Dead Space. As Isaac communicates with his team, a 2D holograph image appears before Isaac, which the player can rotate. The static overlaid onto the video and audio logs is incorporated nicely, and the creeks and cracks heard throughout the broken ship add much to the atmosphere. Listen for the lullaby. Players may pick up quickly on how Visceral tries to scare its players. They use the same formula that Hollywood does, during a tense or critical moment in the game they play loud music like the typical brass pieces you hear in most horror movies. More often than not this takes place when a player looks in the direction of an enemy. So this tactic may help a player in certain areas rather than scare him or her. If a player is not paying attention and some random horns start playing, that is a pretty good indication that there was probably a monster that ran past the door that they probably missed. Pros: controls work extremely well on the PS3, terrifying boss battles, graphics and sound are gripping, Cons: : unoriginal enemies, predictable but engaging story, very easy to beat, lots of backtracking Bottom Line: I recommend this game in spite of my criticism of the unoriginality of some of its elements but it is defendable to question why this game has been so highly touted. Some have labeled Dead Space as the ‘Worlds Scariest Game’ and people are shouting from roof tops to “Buy this game immediately!”. The game isn’t perfect, but what is? It has a wonderfully smooth flowing story, a great environment, near perfect controls and graphics that can make a grown man cry. Dead Space is solid game that should be experienced by as many players as possible. There are striking resemblances to a dozen pieces of work, but they are forgivable. Expect a sequel.			"

												It's like you were dropped off in a horror movie. The fear will consume you. Your heart will pound after being jumped on when you least expect it. That fear will make you into a heartless machine that will anticipate any attack from any corner. You see that dark corner over there? Definitely going to be jumped there, you think to yourself. You think to yourself that you are the master of horror and know what will happen. You play several scenarios in your head of different actions to take when you get to that corner as you walk over with your gun drawn, anticipating a jump. Nothing. Paranoia is a sign of insansity, my friend. You will not escape this world as the same person you were when you entered.			"

												A terrifyingly good TPS game. Dead Space - I believe - reinvented the genre and showed that there were originals games at the time. I liked both its sequels - yeah, the 3rd part has more action, so what? The story continues, so this was needed so those of you who prefer the scary parts can easily play the first game again.Pros:--- hologram-like ingame menu: your inventory, the map, and even your objectives are projected in front of you--- the concept of dismemberment: forget everything you learned from FPS games - headshots this time will not work, at all--- amazing graphics and equally high-quality audio: my favourites are the zero-g scenes where you hear your breathing more than the surrounding sound--- high replayability due to the unlockable items, difficulty modesCons:--- not much to say here, really, perhaps that the game can be difficult at times, but not because it truly is challenging but because fighting in close-quarters can only be difficult (you cannot really come up with any proper tactics)The sequels only improve upon the experience by expanding upon the story and giving the protagonist a face and voice.

Dead Space is a good ride through a pretty scary ship. Packed with jump scares. The monsters are straight out of the 80's movie “The Thing”, with almost an Event Horizon style of design to the ship. There is a nice leveling up system, and there are some interesting weapons. There is even some Zero G action, which was a nice touch. The game does have a frustrating part at the end of chapter 4, but before you rage quit put down your 360 controller and grab your gaming mouse (solves the problem trust me). Dead Space is definitely one to buy on steam sale if you haven’t played it. The game being older runs well on a most systems (not your grandmas Windows 95, but anything from 2012 and up should be fine). The only thing that could have made this better would be some co-op, but it may have killed some of the atmosphere. Turn off the lights, crank up the volume, and get ready. Here it comes!OLDER GAMER APPROVED

												This is hands down one of my all time favorite games. I played all of these games in a mixed order, so this one, the first one, is the last one that I beat. The story was incredibly captivating and kept me on edge. The game play is based on focus and using everything you can to your advantage. Jump scares and intense alien combat are great. Highly reccomended. Personally, my favorite of the series.			"

												I find it easier to write reviews in a Pro and Con list style, as I find it's a more effective way to get my meaning across, so please bare with me if it's not to your tastes. The Pro's -Good graphics, even with things like AA and other advanced settings off.-Great atmosphere, especially with the music score at its full intensity and also by letting your imagination wander while playing.  -As I just touched upon, the sound design is fantastic, constant bangs, clunks, moans, and rattles give the effect that you are indeed aboard a decaying ship, with monsters moving throughout it. Fleshy bits make an appropriate ""squish"" when shot, and guns have an appropriate ""oomph"" to them. -Good variety of enemies, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. For example, Slashers are fast, but have exposed legs, Pregnomorphs are slow, but hard to take down without spilling their ""cargo"" all over the floor, etc. Other types of enemies have other weaknesses. -The A.I. is pretty good. Enemies will charge you if you turn your back, pop out of vents that are close to you, swarm you all at once rather than one at a time, etc. -The story is good, but it does have its issues, as I will state in the Con's section. -Voice acting is good, none of the actor's sound like they ""phoned it in."" While the main protagonist Isaac Clarke doesn't talk, he does make grunts, yells, and appropriately heavy breathing noises when necessary. -Environmental design is great, cargo rooms and mechanical stations are open, crew rooms are more enclosed, with tighter corridors, etc. Rooms are in places that make sense (i.e, no engine room on the opposite end of the ship from where the engines are.) -They story is pretty decently lengthed, I've beaten this game several times (mainly on console) and it still takes me around 8 hours or so. I'd imagine it would probably take a newer player around 10-12 hours to beat.-Character design is good, no one is stereotypical, and each character is decently memorable. -I enjoyed the audio and video log collecting, which helped expand on the backstory and helps determine just what happened aboard the  Ishimura  (the name of the ship you board.)-There's a good variety of weapons, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. There's also different suit levels you can get, which work well and look cool at the same time. -You can upgrade your weapons, armor, Statis unit (slows down enemies and objects), and kinesis unit (pick up objects from a distance) using ""Power Nodes"" you find throughout this ship or bought through the Store aboard the ship. -Each weapon also has an ""alt fire"" mode to it. The plasma cutter changes from horizontal to vertical shooting (more useful than you might think) the Pulse Rifle fires in a circle, etc. -Anti-gravity areas are cool, but could have been done better. (They are done better in Dead Space 2 and 3.)-There's more positive aspects, but that covers most of the main bits.-The game also likes to mess with you in small ways, areas that were safe most of the game may not be safe anymore, some enemies come out of unexpected areas, the game tenses you up for a scare that doesn't happen (but it's done well, and on purpose.)  The Con's -Aiming is a bit iffy with a mouse and keyboard, turning of V-Sync helps, which you have to do both in the in-game settings and in the .cfg files for it to actually work. However, I'd recommend playing with a controller if possible, if not, you can still play the game quite well with a M/KB. -While I stated earlier that the story was pretty good, it's not without flaws. For the most part you are the secondary protagonists *itch for most of the game, doing something or other for them, sometimes when it's something they could do themselves. Not to say they sit on their butts all game, but still. -This game also follows the horror game trope of magically seperating you from you allies when a situation arises. Granted, it doesn't do it as often as other games and sometimes you even meet up with them. (Who'da thunk it?)-As I said, this game has a cool variety of weapons, but for a more skilled player, they are unnecessary. I can make it through this game with just the Plasma Cutter and the Pulse Rifle as my weapons, not even touching the others. On console, I've even done an entire run through of the game with  only  the Plasma Cutter. -The A.I. is good, but it does have its..... moments. I've seen Necromorphs pop out of vents, only to hop right back in and pop out somewhere farther away from me. I've also seen the A.I. not want to walk through doorways that lead out of the area, but are willing to hop in a vent and pop out of a vent that  is  in that new area, for reasons I assume that involve the games pathfinding. -The game also can get repetitive after a while, not that it's not fun, but some Necromorph encounters do get predictable (mainly entering a new area and Necromorphs almost immediately showing up.) -The game has puzzles (not that I mind), but almost all of them are pretty basic and easy (at least to me) and don't offer much challenge. -Controls are tanky (much like Resident Evil 4), which is fine, but in some areas of the game (mainly anti-grav and space areas) these controls can get semi-annoying and cumbersome. -The game just isn't that scary for me, it's pretty decently thrilling the first time you play it, and its got its tense moments, but I was never crapping my pants in horror or dreading to go in the next room. I am also hard to scare however, while some people are quite the opposite.  Nitpicks and Personal Annoyances  -The amount of settings are decent, but nothing to write home about, and I was disappointed by some options that were missing. -The game isn't very optimized, I can play Dead Space 2 with higher settings than this one and run higher frames, yet I play this game with the same settings and get noticeably lower frames per second. -Another reason to turn V-Sync off (as if there weren't enough already) is that it causes a noticeably annoying ""dragging"" feel to your mouse, this is especially present in the Main Menu and the Pause Menu. -This isn't an annoyance, but playing this game with headphones is a good idea, it helps you find enemies easier, helps you get more enthralled in the atmosphere, and just makes it an overall better experience. If I had to give this game a number review it would probably be a 9/10. (It'd be higher without the wonky V-Sync and mild control problems.) And finally: TL:DR -MUST PLAY, BUT 2 SPOOKY 4 ME.  "

												Well, first of all, let's say, that entering Dead Space universe is kinda risky, because it can hold you for a looooong time.Dead Space is a some kind of masterpiece for me. I played it alot on pirated version, when i didn't even have a Steam, so don't pay too much attention about play time, just replayed it one more time on the hardest difficulty.So, what is this game?- First of all. NECROMORPHS! Yus, they are the key feature of this game, you will love them alot. They are very, very interesting, funny, lovely, and cute. But to be honest, ugly as hell, and sometimes Ishimura reminds hell really nice.- Atmosphere. It has amazing sounds, scenes, and environment. Just don't forget to listen to sounds a little more, and you will feel yourself uncomfortable.- Effort, length. Dayum, this game is longer, than 50% of our time's horrors. And very, very well made. Reading and listening to every note is making a wonderful feeling of very deep atmosphere.- Great OST. I don't have any words for it. Had a feeling, that actually it's not a music, but real sounds.Why i didn't say anything negative about game?Because... Urgh, don't even know. I don't think, that this game has something to let people ragequit, except jumpscares.Well. I'm giving to it 10\10, beause it's playable unreally good in our time too.  Graphics are good enough. xD			"

Gameplay wise it's really fun shooting limbs and jumping around in 0 gravity. It doesn't qualify as a survival horror game simply because you are VERY powerful and can wreck every single scrub coming at you.

												I found it unplayable on PC. Mouse aiming AND controller aiming are both worthless. Disabling vsync will only fix the lag and 10fps menus and 30 fps gameplay, which then leaves you with massive obvious tearing because half this game uses strobe lights. Then if you try to force vsync in AMD Panel or D3DOverrider, nothing works. RadeonPro did force vsync but it only ended up making the controls feel even worse. It will not fix the massive deadzone in your aiming. There's no analog to the aiming, or very little. You either dont move, or you turn full speed. Maybe I'm just picky but this is ridiculous. Just get the sequel. It has a nice summary of the first game for you and improved lots of aspects of the game.			"

												Dead Space is in my top ten favorite games list. I love all of the Dead Space games, but something about the first one is just different. It's far scarier than the later games, too.Even though the game is getting older now, and some of the texture don't look great anymore, I still give DS1 a thumbs up. For sure.			"

												Dead Space is a fun survival horror game that plays from the third-person point of view. The story is fascinating and will keep you engrossed as you walk through the dark corridors of the USG Ishimura, a ""planet cracker"" starship that sent out a distress signal. The game has an interesting premise that deserves a single playthrough, but the game does have serious technical flaws towards the game's conclusion that has long been reported on the Internet (lockups, Blue Screen Errors, crashes, etc.) There are a few suggested work-arounds, one of which worked for me, but it essentially kills the game's atmosphere and leaves you disgusted towards the developer/publisher since it is a poorly supported console port.

			More Chapters coming soon. For PC version, turn off ""V sync"", to get over 30 FPS. My PC runs at 200+ FPS. It also fixes input lag. This is on Max settings with a AMD HD 7870.		

I hope you like it because, everyone who likes FPS should have this game and Dead Space 2 and 3 for that matter.			"

												I'll be honest and admit that I failed to get into this one on the PS3 some years back, mostly on account of the controls being too unweildy.  But on PC and a keyboard this game frigging ROCKS (no, not just rocks: whopping great spinning METEORS, damn you all)!     Like any great horror game, the sound design is the single most effective element, and keeps you on your toes constantly...at least until the last quarter or so of the game, by which time things do become a mite predictable. But apart from being a tad overlong for its own good, this is pretty well a must-play for anyone who loves the Silent Hill and/or Resident Evil franchises, or similar third person horror games. It's by and largely a remake of Resident Evil 4 set in space, but fresh enough for all that.     Story and setting-wise, its influences are more noticeably cinematic, namely 2001: A Space Odyssey meets Alien, by way of John Carpenter's The Thing. All exceptionally good company, in other words!  Spooky, fun, stupidly violent...all the things any sane person demands in a video game. Looking forward to the next two!!!Verdict: 9.5/10.			"

												When it was released in 2007 I remember Dead Space being one of the best horror games I had played since the Silent Hill 2/Fatal Frame CB-era. Going back how does it hold up today? A bit on the good, a bit on the bad it seems.First off know that if you like horror games and have never picked up the series then there’s really no reason not to play the game. Despite some of its shortcomings it’s still a deeply immersive experience. Though I think the series as a whole gets lauded as “thah scuriest games evurh!” far too often (as you’ll eventually become used to its brand of trying to scare you and begin predicting where the next enemy is coming from) that doesn’t change the fact that the environments are excellently crafted, deeply foreboding, and the gameplay is fun if not perfect. In fact while I believe the later games certainly improved on the mechanics, and I eventually grew to like Isaacs voice (he’s silent in this one), I think overall this game creates a far better atmosphere. You rarely if ever feel safe, the graphics while aged still look nice, and unlike the later entries unless you’re playing on the easiest difficulty or two (or are a horror god) you’ll be rationing supplies to an extent. Additionally while some dislike it I quite liked the fact that except for a few rare occasions almost all communication with others is done via radio, true it isn’t as cinematic as later entries, but it gives the distinct impression that only you can save yourself and no help is coming. It’s true that thanks to an upgrade system most people do feel rather powerful by the end, but you have to work toward that and in the early to middle game it’s true survival horror.As for the bad, well as I said later games improved on the mechanics and that’s because some of the mechanics are broken. The big mechanic of “shoot the limbs” is completely missed by the inclusion of weapons that can do just as much damage shooting for the core (it can be fun to play through with only the base weapon and it is perfectly effective, but isn’t required and if you’re just breezing through can totally be skipped). The Zero-G sections are awe inspiringly painful to play, you’ll get the hang of it but because you have no control and can only jump from point-to-point it isn’t fun. And the physics are all over the place as well as the hit-boxes at times, especially where stomping or some of the more concentrated weapons are concerned.There’s also a small factor that never really bothered me but I see brought up all the time so it’s worth mentioning. This game truly is “fetch quest, the FPS”. Though the underlying plotline, the history, and the environment of the ship itself are all very interesting the actual activities you’re asked to complete aren’t. EVERYTHING is broken and because the other survivors are a bunch of sissy pants you literally get to fix a starship as a one-man engineering crew. The fact that the other elements are so strong glossed over this for me, but lots of people note it and I can’t deny its truth.In short the game is still a classic. Some of it hasn’t aged as well as other parts but like great horror games from the very start of gaming chances are you’ll easily forgive those things in light of the overwhelming positives.			"

												Just finished Dead Space on Medium (Normal) difficulty. So far the title has been an absolute thrill, with tension and terror at every turn, some physical and some psychological. The backstory of the game is very deep, with you being able to control the character Isaac in an attempt to escape a ship  filled with the undead alive, preferably with his allies and his wife, who is lost onboard. The background is explored through lost recordings, some video, audio, and text, as well as the environment itself.The title itself is very unsettling, as even bumping into a beer can will startle you. Undead can appear behind you, in front of you, above you, all around you. It was fairly challenging on medium, with an option for Easy, Hard, and an unlockable Impossible mode, which I haven't tried out yet. Items can be found through schematics, bought in the store, and then upgraded through the use of nodes (items which you insert into others to make them better). The story is long, around 8-10 hours if you spend time collecting everything. The replayability factor is large enough for maybe 1 or 2 extra playthroughs, which can be spent using your fully upgraded arsenal, or upgrading it to that, and collecting logs you may have missed.The downsides to this title are mentionable, although they don't detract from the experience very much. No steam achievements, cards, or DLC for this title. I cling to hope that EA may port their dlc to the pc, preferably in a package, although its small. I encountered a glitch, which I read is very common for pc gamers. That glitch is called the ""Continue glitch"", where if you start the game on any difficulty other than medium, save, exit, then click continue instead of load game, it will change your save to medium difficulty with no way to go back. I started on Easy the first play through, and it happened to me on chapter 2. This can be avoided though, although it hasn't been patched out yet. The aim is also sort of slow, but I can't tell if its a bug or if its part of the games' unique aiming itself.All in all I rate this game a 9/10. Its a great game to start off a series but it is hindered by an almost unavoidable bug, no steam extras, and no pc DLC, although the other two versions of this game recieved it. Get it on discount and you won't regret it.http://www.isthereanydeal.com "

												Fun as hell, and possibly the best in the series.  An excellent third person shooter - although not particularly scary.  It's very immersive, and you grow to care about the characters.  There is just enough mystery in the game to keep you interested in the storyline.  The fact that there are distinctive ""chapters"" you complete helps you feel a sense of accomplishment while playing - beyond the fact that you’re kicking some freak-monster-zombie ♥♥♥.Ammo is somewhat scarce, which allows for a sense of urgency in the game.  The chapters are varied, and present you with all sorts of different obstacles to overcome.  The upgrade system is simple, but certainly effective.   0n normal, monsters are a little tough, but not much of a challenge.  If you're looking for something more difficult, definitely play on hard.  The only criticism I have is that with my particular graphics card - GTX 770 - some of the character models glitch out and flop all over the place. PERSONALLY I find this hysterical, and am actually happy when it happens, but I could see how for a lot of people this could be frustrating.  Ironically running fraps fixes the issue somehow.  The only part that it really affected me is during a section where a boss fight was supposed to be, the boss never spawned - I just fixed it with fraps for that part of the game and all was good.Do NOT use a mouse with this game, however, because it was poorly ported and there are problems with the mouse sensitivity/acceleration/all sorts of other things, which is known issue.  Controller is certainly best in this situation.   "

												First of all the mouse sensitivity was all over the place. The camera wouldn't move and when it did it would move really slowly, making the game pretty much unplayable. I found a fix for that which still didn't work very well so I decided to play with a 360 controller. That worked fine but then I got to a door which I couldn't walk through because there was an invisible wall in the way. Apparently the first enemy in the game is supposed to come through it and start attacking you but that never happened. It seems a few other people have had this problem because I was able to find a fix which requires you to record with FRAPS while playing which will make the enemy appear and the invisible wall to disappear allowing you to progress.I don't know why I should bother playing any longer if I've already had this many problems in the first 5 minutes of the game. Luckily I got it on sale and only wasted a couple of dollars.			"

												Dead Space remains my all time favourite game. Replayed it over and over on X-Box, love it so much I got it on PC too. In this game you play as an engineer called Issac Clark and is set far far into the future out in Space. It definately does not lack a horror element and has a very very very good storyline. Play this game with headphones and you will appreciate Viscerals attention to sound details. Metal clashing, electricity buzzing, necromorphs (The monsters) moving around in vents, Issac's breathing, screams - all out horror noises. The graphics are good. Most of the game is quite dim to create the horror element. LIghts and sparks of electricity add to an array of lighting effects.You have a great choice of weapons which can be upgraded in-game by collecting powernodes. I love how you have in-game currency and literally do not have to spend real life money at all.PLAY IT before Dead Sppace 2 & 3 - otherwise the story won't make much sense, plus it's by far the best in the trilology.Dead Space - ruining my life since 2008			"

												There are few bad things I can say about this game. It has unskippable cutscenes and dialog. Some of the weapons just ain't great. That's about all. What's left is a thrilling experience and engaging gameplay.You will be fighting corpses twisted by a mysterious plague on a mining ship orbiting an alien world. You will not be a soldier though. You will be a space handyman. Against all expectations, you will be the only hope against this inhuman evil and your weapons will be your tools for the most part.Really I want to leave it at that so you can discover the horrors as Issac, the player character, does.IMPORTANT NOTE: I didn't play this for the longest time because the mouse is super laggy without some tweaks. I'm talking a good second to acknowledge my movements. It is fixable. Search google. It's something to do with the V-Sync implementation. You can override it through your video drivers.			"

												I really feel like this game must be played on hard difficulty because medium just feels like a casual third person shooter, you get tons of ammo and the necromorphs are easy to kill. Hard genuinely feels like a survival horror game. The monsters feel like a real threat because they are challenging and you have to conserve your ammo which creates alot of tension during the fights. I don't think the game is scary at all however. The atmosphere and setting is great but the scares themselves i didn't find effective at all.I can think of two reasons why the scares don't work, guns and third person. When an enemy jumps out you have a way of defending yourself by shooting them so that vulnerability factor is lessened because of that. This is why games like amnesia and outlast work so well at being scary because you have no way of defending yourself. Even a game like Fear works so well, even though its a first person shooter the scares are supernatural and unkillable which is what makes it so effective. Because the game is in third person the monsters don't jump out in your face like they would in first person. The scares are at a distance from you because you are positioned behind the character you are playing. I don't think the game needs to be scary to work though it's still a great game because of its amazing atmosphere and sound effects and the game is just fun to play. 8/10 (Great)			"

												I loved this game so much on the xbox that I played through several times getting all the achievements and even went on to buy it on the PC to live through the story and thrills again. Though everything is scripted, the first playthrough is wonderful. Even after I had just completed my first play through, I thoroughly enjoy playing through it again immediately. A great game for the horror genre.			"

												By far one of the greatest shooters ever. And I don't mean just survival shooters, I mean shooters in general. One of the few games that has a story that doesn't once seem to drag along.   Although you can probably run through the whole game without once giving the story a thought I found it pretty appealling.   Action-wise, keeps you at the edge of your seat all the way. The best horror game I played as of yet with some people saying they culdn't even play it.   On the replayability side of things it does offer unlockable difficulties and also lers you play it as New Game+ with the same difficulty but adding bonuses.   All in all , I'd give it a 9.5 cause I don't believe in 10/10.			"

												Being a huge fan of the horror genre, I was excited to finally get the chance to play ""Dead Space"" when I did.  The atmosphere and story that this game delivers is just that:  Horror.  The player experiences a sense of dread with every sound, or when rounding a corner.  The developers have said they were influenced by several different horror movies, but the two that shine through most notably are ""Event Horizon"" and John Carpenter's adaptation of ""The Thing"".  The story itself revolves around a planetcracker mining vessel known as the USG Ishimura, that sends out a distress signal from the planet Aegis VII.  You play as the engineer, Isaac Clarke, who is dispatched with a small crew to investigate the aforementioned distress signal.  While there isn't much variation on the types of enemies you'll encounter, the game itself is still an enjoyable experience if you love horror.			"

												One of the creepiest games I've ever played. This is mainly due to the feeling of loneliness that you have troughout the game. Isaac reminds me of Gordon Freeman from Half Life: the lonely hero. Dead Space knows how to build the tension by mixing very calm moments with very action-packed moments. And since these moments are pretty unpredictable, you're almost always scared about what will be behind the corner...The 'weak spots' of the enemies also make the game different from your standard zombie shooter.9/10			"

												So as of late I've been pretty bored with games. I've played Mass Effect and found that fun, have been mulling around on Ori  and the Blind Forrest, and have even bought and dowloaded other games that just don't seem to hold my attention. Well, I got some news for you, because I literally have played this game over a four day period from start to finish and loved every minute of it. Dead Space brought horror and dread back into my gaming library like no other game has in a long time. I'm not one for horror games, but if you enjoy sci-fi/action/horror and games like Mass Effect I HIGHLY reccomened you try this game! Pros:- Great use of multiple weapons and different functions for each weapon- Unique grotesque monsters designed off of actual dead and multilated corpses for extra dramatic effect- Enemies are difficult to kill in the sense that they have their own mechanics as in how to kill them all (cutting off limbs etc)- The character Issac may be a silent hero, but certainly a badass for going through some f@$ked up sh#t. - Unique Horror and jump scares- Sound design is wonderful, and you'll learn to hate violin after this game. (Lol)- Good use of starvation on items in certain sections of the game to make you feel like you're at impossible odds until you win.Cons:- Controls are odd and clunky at first, and melee animations and usage is nearly pointless and difficult to actually use- A maze like game where scenery stays stagnent for most of the game and can be boring at times when you enter a room designed like previous ones to know what lies ahead (obviously some baddies from a vent or from a wall)- The game can be very easily manipulated by the player after understanding all monster mechanics, and cheese strating enemies by knowing they cannot enter certain rooms or hallways. (By this I mean using a hallway with a door to protect you, running up so the door opens and popping shots to kill some baddies, then backing away from the door to stay shielded in your safe room)- Ammo clutter for weapons you didn't purchase because the only two weapons you'll ever need is the assult rifle and the pizza cutter (If you play the game, you'll undertsand why i call it the pizza cutter lol.)- underwhelming mini bosses and boss fights using the same mechanics as mobs, or using the same enemy as a boss multiple times.All in all, Dead Space was awesome and I thouroughly enjoyed it! It has its ups and downs with boss battles or mechanics when in Zero gravity and more. But over all it was a fun theatrical experience with many scares. I had blood rushing through my body most of the game. It is loaded with creepy errie sounds coming from vents, objects in the world, dead boddies, and whispers and cries coming from the distance. I can't wait to start playing Dead Space 2! And that's exactly what I intend to do after giving my thoughts on the first one. :)			"

												This is how action/horror should be done- SLOW BURN. I've played this game twice on both 360 and PS3 and now PC. Still a blast. +Simple but engrossing story with a small cast of memorable characters and great voice acting+Even after 5+ play throughs, its extremely satisfying dismembering enemies. Just the crunching sounds alone are fantastic...you can even stomp and crush their bones which is awesome+Lots of scary moments+It IS linear but theres plenty of freedom to go where you want and if you *do* get lost you can simply tap the RS stick and it'll show you where to go+Silent protagonist is always welcome +Nice variety of weapons with a simple but satisfying upgrade system+I like how the inventory, store, and upgrade station are in real time to keep you in the game and the tension high+No stupid silly ""epic"" moments like so many modern games do today (and back in 2008 too)+Even in almost 2017 the game still looks great and runs @ 60fps 1080p+Includes New Game+ to play on harder difficulties with all your equipment. -Seems like if i exit the game and come back to it, my graphics settings were bumped down to medium. Had to manually do this a few times.  -No achievements like the console versions (a very small minor gripe though)And one of the best things- if you beat this game and loved it like i did and wonder if Dead Space 2 is any good well...let me just say it does *everything* right. Reminded me how Resident Evil 2 improved so much from the first game. This is like that. :)9/10 "

												Heads up, if you listen to the wanks that are whining about the controls please read this before you miss this game.You are wearing a fork lift because Isaac is an engineer. He uses his suit to do heavy lifting. It is quite heavy itself and slow to move around in. So, you will feel it when you move. It is much heavier than what the security guy and the computer gal wear. You will feel like the suit is heavy (it is), top heavy (that too) and fairly tough. It can function in space for short periods of time, so it is not a pair of coveralls.Also, note that his first weapon (and my favorite) is a plasma cutter. Works great in the environment as intended, and not too bad in the new environment he is facing. I jumped back into the game, on sale(!), and it was like old times. Learn to cut the limbs, figure out how to adjust the blade. READ the command prompts BEFORE you exit them. Help is focused on KB/M so I had to futz around remembering how the controller mapped to the functions.If you use a KB/M ... well you are sort of on your own. Sorry, the game was designed for consoles and game controllers. That is how I played it and that is how I am playing it this time.Save points are little access points mounted on the walls. Learn to look for them early. Think old school console save points, like sitting down in Ico or sleeping in Fallout games.			"

												Back when Dead Space first came out I was really not interested in it. I initially thought it was just a modernized System Shock 2 ripoff. When I play it now I don't really see that. It's actually more Resident Evil 4 in space.You play as Isaac Clark and you're sent with a bunch of engineers to repair this one space ship yadda yadda yadda insert Alien reference here. One thing I should mention about Dead Space is it's a very polished game. The graphics and engine still hold up relatively well, and the lack of heads up display is fairly immersive. The storyline leaves something to be desired but like every game in this genre it has good audio logs.At the very least Dead Space still retains good value for money to this day, and if you enjoyed Resident Evil 4 this will appeal to you greatly.

												Dead Space provides one of the most interesting stories I have ever heard. A heavily immersive third person horror with a well developed story, as well as unique characters and enemies alike. Weapons and pick-ups are a topic in game that can make your brain think. Health is a vital thing, so you need to think about what med packs you should carry; small, medium, or large. You also must make room for ammo, as you might run out of that in only two rooms! Once you have planned out your inventory space, you can now take in the atmosphere-or not. Incredible sound system and atmosphere has you on edge in every location. When those lights turn out, so do the sounds for a brief moment. Then...BAM! Roar! This kind of encounter brings the chills down your spine like no other! Last but not least, is the story. To be honest, the story was the true reason I kept playing, as every chapter kept getting more and more interesting. If you want a scary game to play loud and proud on a dark and stormy night, this will be a keeper.			"

												Dead Space is a rare kind of game and one of the best linear singleplayer games I've ever had the tremendous pleasure to play. It has profoundly affected me as a gamer and has shown to me that you can do a lot with a little and make a game that not only plays good, but looks good. I feel it is a classic no one should go without, even if one is faint of heart.Dead Space has been out for many years and, by now, it has been thoroughly explored by player and developer alike. Even still, its well-balanced gameplay, mixing satisfying weapons handling, unique dismemberment mechanics, and survival elements that pressure the player throughout the game, leave it as one of the most entertaining third person shooters I've ever played. Interesting balancing of the player's enemy-slowing stasis module and object-manipulating kinesis tool make for unusual puzzles and gunplay that's more than just gunplay. Weapon balance, level design, and enemy variety all make for challenging combat scenarios that can vary greatly in execution with every combination of weapons, stasis use, and kinesis use.Graphically, Dead Space is unusually high in quality for its technical fidelity. While the game has relatively low detail models and textures, its good aesthetic direction, breathtaking animations, and clever manipulation of lighting and effects make for a game that will remain visually pleasing for a long time. Voice acting by its cast and atmosphere by its audio team continue to blow me away in sheer quality, even after nearly a dozen playthroughs between console and PC that have solidifed nearly every turn in my memory. Overall, I feel Dead Space has such cinematic and aesthetic quality that some live action movies fall short in comparison.A linear game such as Dead Space would be little but an on-rails third person shooter without a good story and, with all its great aesthetic traits in mind, it does not fail to disappoint. While not immensely groundbreaking, its often psychologically-oriented horror, novel take on otherwise run-of-the-mill space zombies, and interesting backstory woven into audio and text logs make it thoroughly enjoyable.No game is without its failings somewhere and, while I feel Dead Space's are relatively few, this game most certainly has some. While understandable as part of its placement in the horror genre, movement feels unusually clunky at times. Physics oddities and interaction with moving objects can make for some very bizarre moments, ranging from comically confounding and common ragdoll spasms to infrequent, but frustrating random deaths and object disappearances. Puzzles are often simple and blatantly obvious, usually relying overwhelmingly on the threat of death rather than true complexity.Additionally, Dead Space was made for consoles first, PCs second. Many users have run into issues with gamebreaking bugs resultant from their setup or PC-specific options and other port problems - such as control scheme modification being difficult at times - and, as with any console port, be ready for a little bit of work to get it to play nice. I, personally, did not experience many issues, but caution and patience are advised regardless.Modding in Dead Space is essentially non-existent, to my knowledge, as with many other Electronic Arts-backed titles. I feel the lack of support for a modding community is an incredible shame, as its gameplay and atmosphere could have been ripe candidates for talented and amateur modders alike.In the end, if you don't own Dead Space, whether you prefer action or horror, I strongly urge you to change course and pick it up. It is a title that has thoroughly impressed me and, for a time, restored some faith in Electronic Arts. It is a game that spooked me, challenged me, and satisfied me enough to buy it for both Xbox 360 and PC. It is an experience that I honestly believe you would do yourself a disservice not to try. It has earned every little penny I spent on it and thensome, and I will remember it fondly for years to come.			"

												This game is just straight up, no doubt about, 100% fact, awesome. It's also poop your pants scary. The graphics are very dark and detailed, which fits the game just right. The storyline is gripping, extremely intense, and, well, scary! Did I mention this game is super scary? Anyway, the game manages you to put yourself into the main characters shoes very well, even though Isaac Clarke, the man you play as in the game, does not talk, which something very few games manage to do. The gameplay is very gory, violent, and fun. I'd have to say this is one of my favorite games I played this summer, and I have to say, I don't like a lot of scary games!So in conclusion, Dead Space is just plain awesome, and I look forward to playing Dead Space 2 and 3. If you're looking for a game that is scary, but at the same time, has a great storyline and epic mechanics, then this game is for you.			"

												Yes, this game has weird mouse controls. Now, with all the negatives out of the way, this is hands down one of the greatest survival horror games out there -- that is, if you play it on Hard or higher (a strange bug causing your game to suddenly switch difficulty from Hard to Normal has however yet not been resolved and never will be). Love atmospheric survival horror but feel like being unable to defend yourself is not fun? Dead Space has you covered -- in layers of blood. Yes, one or two well placed shots to limbs (great system, headshots make no sense here anyway) can disarm (har har) the enemy, but the same pretty much applies to you -- ignore an enemy and say goodbye to half of your medpacks.Yes, this game utilizes jumpscares. A lot. But it also loves to fake them with long build-ups that result in a vent cover simply falling off. Together with DS2, this is THE survival horror series of our time. And yes, DS2 has superior gameplay, but it lacks the Alien-like atmosphere of this one. And DS3 lacks the ability to let your wallet intact (don't bother).Recommended: Do Unitologists like Markers?

												Dead Space – это научно-фантастический хоррор-экшен, который рассказывает историю рядового инженера на космическом корабле Исаака Кларка. Перед нами первоклассный научно-фантастический ужастик, авторы которого умудряются аккуратно играть на нервах на протяжении всего приключения.  В игре присутствуют космические зомби и инопланетные расы.  Враги быстрые, резкие, нападают группами и потому каждый бой увлекает, ибо приходится использовать все доступные средства, помнить об умениях, тактически планировать. Моя оценка 9/10.			"

												Highly recommended if you're willing to put up with a wonky port. Vsync locks the game to 30 fps, but running over 60 fps results in gamebreaking bugs. You might be able to fix that by forcing Vsync in your video card control panel, but I have a 144Hz monitor and it didn't work for me, even when I set my monitor to 60Hz.Also, there is awful negative mouse acceleration that makes playing this game with M+K really difficult. Some people have reported that locking to 60 fps fixes that too, but as with the bugs it didn't work for me. So, I ended up playing this game in ""console mode"" at 30 fps with a controller. That was actually OK, as good frame pacing and tactfully implemented motion blur make 30 fps totally fine in this game, and the shooting is not awful with a controller since it's relatively short-range and imprecise.Anyway, if you're not familiar with Dead Space, it's a survival-action horror-ish game where you have to dismember your enemies by cutting off their limbs rather than shooting them in the head or the body. The combat is excellent and very weighty and visceral. You have to cut, stomp, and bludgeon your enemies to death with engineering tools rather than shoot them run-and-gun style like in many shooter games. You also get to scavenge for ammo, health packs, and power nodes to help upgrade your armor and ammo. It's got a resource management component, but I didn't find that keeping my ammo well-stocked was all that hard.It takes place on a mining starship where the crew have all been infected with an alien parasite that transforms them into the limb-swinging monsters you have to fight. There's a lot more backstory, of course, but to reveal it would be to spoil the fun of uncovering what happened. You learn about the story from clues in the environment itself, rather it's text notes or messages scrawled in blood on the wall. There aren't too many jumpscares - the game is more gory than scary. The level design is linear but gives you just enough freedom to make you feel like you're in a real place and not a corridor. It's clearly dated graphically, but the design aesthetic of the game is consistent and compelling - this is a game world that's fun to look at and explore, even though it's full of gore.Overall, definitely worth a look if you're one of the 2 people who haven't played it yet, but be aware of the PC port issues before buying.

												Dead Space is one of the best survival action horror games out there. Is it resident evil 4, no. That dosen't mean it's bad. It's hard to be as good as RE4. It is a game that has some really great parts (first chapter is one of my favorite first levels ever) and some god awful parts ( boss fights, cluster♥♥♥♥ rooms). Either then the boss fights being bad (the regenerator is just a easy, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ nemesis) and being put into combos like it's mahvel and being able to buy ammo (makes the game way easier) it's just a few things from making this game top tier. I highly recomend this game and if you don't play this on hard, you're a casual.9/10 would poop myself againAlso one of EA's few good games!			"

												It's the original Dead Space... It uses the tried and true Resident Evil 4 formula and it works... it's creepy, it's actually scary, it's a survival horror with a sci-fi theme that doesn't actually suck like most movies of the same genre.After this one they fall heavily off the track and by Dead Space 3 you have a co-op 3rd person action horror game for the casuals that can't play games alone in the dark without shatting themselves.Stick with the original if you want a true survival horror experience.

												This game holds up way better than I expected it to. For me it feels like they put Metroid Prime and Resident Evil 4 into a blender and created this beatiful survivor/horror game. As you go on through out the game your skills progress and you find different strategies for how to tackle an enemy. You also can upgrade your suit by buying a new one with credits at the store, and you can upgrade your weapons at benches by spending power nodes which are scattered all over the place. I've been playing the game on hard difficulty, and I'm using mouse and keyboard. It's not that hard of a game, once you figure out the game's core you'll be fine in no time. I would however only recommend this game only to people who don't have a weak stomach. I can't eat or drink while playing, because my body just wants to vommit at some of the grotesque stuff you come across. Enjoy! 9/10			"

												Haven't gotten around to finishing it yet but, if you like scary games, this is definitely the one for you. While it does have some jump scares, like many games of this type do, it doesn't rely on them in any way, shape, or form. Dead Space is all about ambiance. Almost no matter where you go, there's deep dark shadows where things can lurk, twisted and broken scenery from past struggles, gaps in the walls, ceilings, and floors so that you can see the creatures crawling between walls and into vents. Then there's the sound. At all times there's the sounds of loose metal clanking, echoes of transmissions being broadcast and some of the eeriest music you'll find on a game. All of this combines to engender a feeling of constant anxiety while playing.			"

												I have had some mixed feelings about this game, but then again this happens for a lot of horror games I've played. I'm not a big fan of jumpscares as I feel them being a cheap way to enthrill. Then again I've played this game through 3 times and the reason for that is that this game has a very good gameplay. It has some mediocre issues in storytelling and atmosphere that prevents this being an outstanding game. Instead, this is just good.I have played all parts of the series, except third installement is still uncompleted. Then again the third one didn't seem to have anything to do with the first one so I though I might as well review this now.The plot of the game is pretty generic. In space no one can hear you scream. Weird monsters invade space ship and the protagonist must fight back after their immediate escape possibilities are cut down. Plot starts immediately and isn't very surprising at any point. Player travels back and forth in the ship doing stuff while other characters in the game stand still and cry. Kendra Daniels is one of the most annoying side characters I've so far seen or heard in a game.The part where this game excels is that it makes the playing part fun, although the plot is uninsteresting. By giving the possibility to cut limbs instead of just shooting aliens, this game makes the fights somewhat more interesting and more pleasing. In a fight with multiple enemies, one can shoot their legs off before move to finishing them with another weapon. Also by making playable character a walker instead of a runner, the game is much better paced than some other horror games. Sure he can run, but he cannot shoot while running and running usually ends in a situation where a necromorph is close enough to hug Isaac.Then again even though the pacing excels, this is yet another example where I think the game could've used a real director(like movies have). Though the game tries to be a horror game, it rarely excels in it. Most of the enemies are given away by loud roars or sudden violin sounds. Basically player just turns to where ever the sound came and shoots. Some jump scares are not enough to call it a horror game. It's a jump-scare-game. I'm not afraid of jumpscare, I just don't like them, like sewage. The game loses a lot of atmosphere by doing this. Games scaries part are the vacuum scenarios where no sound is played, so one must stay alert all the time for the enemy. Also there are occasionally so many enemies that I felt like playing a shooter instead of atmospheric horro game.The game is really cheap today(2,5eur in sales) so no hurt trying. Easiest difficulty setting is enough to take any challenge out of the game if one feels like going it just for the story, although some atmosphere is lost by doing this.To anyone suffering mouse problems, try V-sync out and force v-sync from video driver software or utilities like radeonpro. Also playable without v-sync but some say they've had problems related to one door not opening. Also playing without any kind of vsync might cause coil whine in gpu with FPS running over 200 with better cards(2012 enthusiast ->)I recommend this game as a nice way to pass 8-10 hours, but don't expect anything great out of it. It's solid and it's good enough to give it a try. If you don't like it, don't buy the next installements either, they give nothing more.			"

												Dead Space is the classic definition of horror. This game made me feel so uncomfortable and disgusted, yet so attached and interested. It has a good story, filled with mistery and conspiracy. Everything about the game feels right and natural. It delivers a solid gameplay, which consists of exploring and fixing a huge ship, fighting an endless variety of necromorphs, playing with gravity, crafting and upgrading equipment, uncovering the truth about what happened, and just trying to survive. You get to be Isaac Clarke, the ""speechless"" protagonist of the game, who slowly goes insane while under the effects of a ""relic"" called - The Marker.    The game's name is the perfect description of how the game feels. Everything seems so cold, so lifeless, diseased and abandoned. Everywhere you look, it's just cold metal walls, dry blood spilled on the floor and doors, rotten bodies everywhere and flickering xenon lights. Aside the ship, there are also times when you have to go ""outside"". The space looks gorgeous. It's dark and dangerous, but also endlessly beautiful. All of these create an unforgettable atmosphere, full of terror, shock and dementia. I wish I could say ""Don't worry, it's not that scarry."" But I can't. You will get scared. Even when you tread carefully, trying to notice the vents or ducts from where the necromorphs might come, you'll still get surprised every time. The developers have scripted the game so well, that it's impossible not to get scared. You'll start getting used to the monsters after a while. And when you're letting your guard down for a minute, just when you least expect it, you get a instant heart attack and a broken chair.   Dead Space makes you feel absolutely stranded, alone, but not helpless. The player can choose from a variety of weapons and tools. Which not only look cool, but also behave differently. And each of those weapons can be found and upgraded at the Work Benches. You also get to use Kinesis, which is totally awesome. Especially when combined with the Stasis. But what I liked the most most, was the suit. The RIG, as they call it, can also be upgraded and augumented. I just loved it. It looked so armored and heavy, and cold. But also so very cool and protective. The game becomes more challenging as you progress. There are new types of monsters lurking the corridors, wishing to get their... hands/paws/claws/teeth/blades/tails/tentacles/quills/proboscis/pustules and other limbs around your neck. But besides all those gruesome and brutal deaths, there are also other things that can and will kill you if you're not careful enough. Such as getting hit with some massive spinning tethers, getting electrocuted, running out of air, being hit with a meteorite, jumping into open space, and my personal favorite - getting crushed by a door. That's just what I remember anyway. But I'm sure there's a lot more to choose from.    Another absolutely great feature of this game is the sound and music. Everything sounds just right. Shooting sounds awesome. Stomping and punching the necromorphs feels so very satisfying, because I always found myself crushing every body I saw. Which is a little strange come to think of it... Oh, and the music. I don't know if you can really call it music, because it's mainly a series of very well done ambient soundtracks. Always tensionate, rhythmic, and terror-inducing. Nothing scares me more than a rotten-baby-tentacle-monster jumping on me, while some extremely loud and terrifying chimes are playing on the background. But it was also... fun. I liked to be scared. And if you like to be scared too, this is it my friend.   Although this game was made back in 2008, it looks fantastic. It has got awesome lightning, good-looking models and a most satisfying dismembering system. You can literally tear someone's limbs apart, one by one. And a good physics engine that allows you to do a lot of crazy stuff with those gravity boots.   Finally, a must play. It's a shame I haven't played this a long time ago. This game delivers an amazing experience, full of horror and action. With a good story and lovely sound design.   You need to hear this.  10/10 "

												When people say that only the japanese can make good survival horror, I slap them and tell them to play this game. It's EA before they got greedy, and Visceral before they started making mediocre action games. While it's relatively short and light on exploration, it tells a great story and is truly a horrifying experience if played in the dark with headphones in.Make yourself whole, buy this game.			"

												Excellent game, very moody and very creepy. Finally a new IP that takes horror seriously.It gets more action oriented about halfway through though, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing as the atmosphere will still be tense. The menus also integrate well into the gameplay without pausing the entire game so you have to keep on your toes at all times. Since the game takes place in space the graphics are a bit futuristic, but still dark. The voice overs are very good (your character doesn't speak though) and the sounds are just amazing.If you love horror games, make sure this is on your 'to play' list., I guarantee you won't be disappointed.[Rating: 89/100]			"

												Dead Space is one of those horror games that EVERYONE should own. The entire trilogy is worth every penny spent. The first game isn't perfect. It's flawed, it has issues, it's not really scary - but it's a damn good game.GRAPHICS: Visually, the game has aged quite a bit, but the graphics do their job. The game is every much as visceral and gory and disgusting as you could want, filled with Saw-like moments that leave you wanting to throw up.SOUND/MUSIC: The musical score isn't too special, but it does its job. Most of the soundtrack is composed of typical horror themes that play during jump scare moments. The sound design, however, is fantastic - every monster, gun, creak and groan of the ship; all of them set you on edge. There's never a moment where you feel safe, even on the easiest difficulty with the most maxed out character you could ever create. It's simply a wonder for horror fans.STORY: Story-wise, Dead Space is possibly one of the most unoriginal pieces ever conceived. If Ridley Scott's Alien was merely Jaws in space, then Dead Space is just Ridley Scott's Alien but with zombies. The plot is predictable, the characters on-dimensional and unlikable in every conceivable way, and the twists and turns so dull and emotionless that it makes M. Night Shyamalan look good by comparison. This game isn't really going to satisfy people searching for deep, interesting, unique lore by any stretch, but it's good enough to compel you to complete the game.GAMEPLAY: This is where the game flops - or at least, the PC version does. I played Dead Space on the Xbox 360 long before I had a functioning PC that could run anything more demanding than Solitare, and even then, the gameplay was clunky, but it at least worked. The PC version seems like it wasn't tested at all. The mouse and keyboard controls are abysmal and practically broken. The aiming in particular is so bugged that it's nearly impossible to hit your targets without wasting half of your ammo, and when it comes to the Dead Space formula (shoot off the limbs) that requires precision, it's absolutely ludicrous that the developers would skimp out on testing the most important part of the game. The Dead Space franchise has always had stellar gameplay: there's no hud, leaving you to see your health meter, ammo, and other such important pieces of information on your guns or armour. The gameplay consists of strategically shooting the limbs off of your opponents, and it's a blast to play, but even when I plug my Xbox controller into my PC, the port simply barely works. I've played this game for years, and can't even begin to count the amount of unnecessary deaths I've experienced on the PC port due to bad controls that hindered my ability to aim. The sad part is, I TRULY love this game, but with controls that are so dysfunctional, I doubt that I'll ever pick it up on my PC again.I wish there was an in-between rating, because the game is DEFINITELY worth playing, but people should be warned about the bad controls. Overall, if you can find a series of mods that will keep you from destroying your PC from the rage that this game will put you through due to the devs refusing to test it out, then you should DEFINITELY buy it.

												Dead Space is a survival horror game where you play a mute space engineer named Isaac Clarke. Isaac is a tragic character. When he was a child, malfunctioning SecuRom DRM prevented him from playing his favourite game. This traumatised him so badly he never spoke again. Although he occasionally yells ""Fark EA"", but nobody knows what that means.Isaac and his team are on their way to the Japanese mining ship USG Kutabare because a rare Pokemon that they want has been spotted on board. The USG Kutabare is a huge Chinko class mining ship that strip mines entire planets for rare minerals like Tiberium, Adamantium, Kryptonium and Unobtanium. Also, Isaac's attractive girlfriend Nicole is there and he's hoping to catch up with her for some surreptitious zero-gravity nookie.When they arrive near the USG Kutabare they suspect that something is wrong. Not only is the mining ship not responding, there are no Greenpeace ships in sight and no environmental activists chaining themselves to asteroids. Unbeknownst to Isaac and his team, something has indeed gone horribly wrong on board the ship, and its status is now officially 'clitical[www.engrish.com]'. That means 'seriously bad' in Japanese.Upon docking, they find the ship strangely deserted, and this is where the true horror begins. Some chick named Kendra starts telling Isaac what to do despite her not being his girlfriend or his wife. Isaac go get the keycard. Isaac go open that door. Isaac go fix the tram. Isaac put the toilet seat down. Isaac has to do everything she says. Seriously scary stuff. Admittedly Kendra is rather hot and perhaps Isaac is hoping to catch up with her for some surreptitious zero-gravity nookie.Anyway after much faffing about, Isaac discovers a sinister conspiracy involving the colony on the planet below. Hoping that there might be some colonist's daughters he could rescue from their virginity, he decides to investigate further. Apparently the colonists found an ancient alien obelisk thousands of years old. They also unearthed a box of McDonald's Cheeseburgers buried in the dirt that was also thousands of years old, but still edible. However no one was impressed because you could still buy McDonald's Cheeseburgers from the colony cafeteria that were older than that.During the excavation of the alien obelisk, the colonists accidentally released a contagious alien saprophytic parasite that contaminated the entire colony. This insidious alien parasite is not only highly virulent but capable of transforming corpses into monsterous human-porkchop hybrids called Necrochops. Mistaking the alien parasite for Curry Vindaloo, the colonists ate most of it during their Thanksgiving celebrations and were sadly all transformed into slavering monsters. Dumb ♥♥♥ colonists.Following in the footsteps of horror themed luminaries such as the F.E.A.R. and Residential Evil series, Dead Space is certainly not an original concept. What it does do incredibly well however is the atmosphere. Soft, almost indistinct susurration permeate the ship. Corpses, severed limbs, and other unidentified viscera litter the claustrophobic corridors. Blood splatters decorate the walls like the abstract art of some deranged artist. Lights flicker and occasionally go out. The feeling of paranoia, dread, and unease is palpable. This is the closest you'll ever get to the experience of being afraid and alone on a desolated ship beset by monsters. Other than going on a Contiki Cruise as an attractive nubile female.There are obligatory jump-scares, although they are used sparringly and not ingeminated to the point of banality. Incidentally, never trust corpses. Not because they send scam emails but because some of them have a disconcerting habit of re-animating at inopportune times. Conveniently, Isaac has a stomp attack and it's your sacred duty to stomp every single corpse into so much tenderised porkchop. It's the only way to be sure.Because Isaac is only an engineer, and not some tough Space Marine, most of his weapons are construction equipment that he uses in ways that contravene every single Health & Safety regulation in existence. Who would have thought the humble Plasma Cutter would be a good for impromptu face reconstruction surgery. But desperate times and all that. Fortunately for Isaac, he's on a Japanese ship and you can buy everything from ubiquitous vending machines; from dangerous weapons and ammunition to schoolgirl panties.The action of Dead Space is similar to the tactical 3rd-person aim-shoot style of Resident Evil instead of the FPS run-and-gun style of F.E.A.R. and Bioshock. What Dead Space does uniquely is the innovative selective dismemberment combat system where the good old Double Tap head-shot just doesn't cut it anymore. Severing the various articulated appendages of your target is the key to victory. Isaac also gets a stasis ability that allows him to violate the Laws of Physics by slowing time. It's used mainly for crowd control when surrounded by Necrochops and useful for getting that perfect sirloin cut.Dead Space has a steep difficulty curve, similar to Bioshock and Resident Evil 4, where the game is initially difficult because of weak weapons and sparse ammunition but gets easier after weapon and suit upgrades. Isaac has a melee attack, but it's about as effective as arguing with strangers on the Internet. Completing the game unlocks a New Game+ mode that allows you to retain your equipment and upgrades in the previous playthrough, but only on the same difficulty. Starting a new game in a higher difficulty resets your equipment back to nothing.Barring a few exceptions, Dead Space has aged rather well. It runs in 1080p with good frame rates and still looks good. However there are some problems with VSync on modern machines that prevents progress but workarounds are available. Also glitchy PhysX can sometimes cause corpses to catapult around the room, but the effect is more hilarious than horrific.Highly recommended for fans of space horror movies like Alien, Event Horizon, Prometheus, and Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens. This is one of those games that is best experienced in the quiet of the night, in a dark room, wearing brown underpants. Also best played alone. In space, no one can hear your girly screams.			"

												SCARY. That is the short review. Since its been a while since I played it, that is the overrall tone of the game. You play as Isaac, an engineer who just can't catch a break. You go to investigate a ship that has gone dark and is in need of repair. Boy does it need repair. The game has jump scares which I don't find to be a negative because there is tons of others stuff that should creep you out. The ship is a character, as you piece the story together through various videos, documents, and audio journals. It is a creepy story. Also, you feel very alone. Even though you arrive with a small team, it quickly becomes apparent that no one can really help you. I like to think of the monsters as space zombies, and man are they freaky. Instead of the normal pop them in the head method, you have to take care of the limbs instead. There is a nice variety of weapons and armor to keep you on par with the nightmares you face. This is a game meant for playing after 10 PM with a good set of headphones. The ending is great and creepy and gets you ready for Dead Space 2. Even though it relies on shooting and blasting your way through, you will be on pins and needles the whole way through, wondering if your gun is enough to get you through in one piece.			"

												If you want to play this game, play it on a console.PC version is extremely buggy and crashes frequently. The game was not made to be played with a mouse. Menus are only navigable with arrow keys, mouse sensitivity is ♥♥♥♥ed up, cannot turn off mouse acceleration. Zero-G jumps onto uneven surface or at too shallow an angle consistently causes freezing and death. ""Continue"" instead of ""Load Game"" will sometimes change your game difficulty, with no way to change it back.Half way through a run on Hard, I got bugged down to Medium and the game became trivial. There was almost no increase in difficulty for the second half of the game. I spent the entire game drowning in ammo and money. You start with the best weapon in the game; the rest are irrelevant. Very few of my deaths were attributable to enemies. Most of them were environmental deaths, and about half of those were the previously mentioned Zero-G bug. Final boss was underwhelming.Those things aside, the game was okay. Story was decent I guess. Gameplay was fine when not bugging. I had enough fun to finish it, but I'm probably never coming back to it.			"

												Dead Space is a First Person Shooter-Horror game where you arrive at a Spaceship which has ceased communication and must figure out what has happened to the crew. You make your way through various levels of the ship and learn about the horrors that have taken place, while fighting a variety of creatures who have infested the ship. With monsters that jump out around every corner, the game offers a fast-paced, fright-fest and should not be played by the feint of heart.I don't have to give away any more of the plot as it is a pretty interesting storyline. The learning curve is fairly decent and the game is fun on the hardest settings for the experienced FPS'er. Graphically speaking the game looks pretty good, the lighting is fantastic and adds to the thrill and horror of the gameplay. Dead Space is a good game to purchase and has been successful enough to spawn sequels			"

												So I wouldn't quite call myself a horror game enthusiast, but I certainly do enjoy the rush you get when playing games with some quite chilling and terrifying situations. Of all the scary games I have played, Dead Space still stands out in my mind.500 years in the future, you find yourself in the shoes of everyman engineer Isaac Clarke, who is sent on repair mission to fix communication issues on a deep-space mining vessel, the Ishimura. Little did he and his 5 man crew realize what they were walking into. Within minutes you are deep within the halls of the Ishimura, being attacked by an army of monsters known as ""Necromorphs"", all the while attempting to repair the heavily damaged vessel and hoping to escape with your life.Completing this game the first time had me with my jaw on the floor. The characters, the story, the graphics/atmosphere and the twist ending all kept me awake the next couple nights thinking about what I had just played. This game was incredible. I'm going to talk about each of the aforementioned parts of the game, and if I can think of any, criticisms for this game. I will do my best to keep this review spoiler free.On the characters; Isaac Clarke. Silent protagonist for a sci-fi/horror survival game? Surprisingly effective. It doesn't give his character a lot of depth but there are clever ways to convey his emotion through either gestures or his journal notes. The other two main protagonists are just your normal captain and computer specialist characters. While being average may not seem to be something worthy of praise, the game does a great job selling their situation. Being on a ship in deep space loaded with murderous aliens and a complex mystery is extremely terrifying and life-threatening, and their actors portray how people would act in a lethal situation.For the story, my god what a compelling one. Where is the crew? Why are these aliens running rampant on this ship? What the hell happened here? All were questions I had in my head throughout the game. As soon as one thing is figured out more questions arise, ESPECIALLY the ending. The depth, the emotional impact and the mystery surrrounding what happened on the ship all make the game that much more enjoyable. I don't want to talk too much about it as I don't want to spoil important plot points :)Especially for its time being released in 2008 this games graphics hold up pretty well. There are some terribly awful things (notably the hair on the main female protagonist), but aside from that and possibly a few minor things the graphics are terrific. The atmosphere. I swear about 90% of the time playing this game I was on the edge of my seat with my heartbeat off. That's how immersing and gripping this game is. Even when I replay it today I still feel the same way after 70 hours of it. The atmosphere is very convincing as the game is claustrophobic, eerie, dark and truly sells that this is a ship in deep space.I'm not gonna talk about the ending :) buy the game and enjoy it for yourself don't let me ruin it!There are only two real criticisms I have about this game and they are more of nit-picks and my own personal feeling after having 70 hours in the game.The first issue I have is the lack of consistent action, as there are moments throughout the game with lengthy battles, and there are moments of about 5 solid minutes of not shooting something. While a bit disappointing, the horror often times fills up the gaps of action. Now with the horror my issue is it becomes a bit flat as the game progresses. The game uses the same gimick with slight changes for scares repeatedly, sometimes it works, but a couple hours in the game it gets a little stale. However that all changes when the new type of Necromorph is introduced and another curveball is thrown at you. My absolute biggest issue with this game is the controls. I don't know what happened with the conversion from Xbox 360 to PC, or may it's just steam being bad, but there is some SERIOUS input lag with the mouse. There is a grossly notable delay in moving the mouse when compared to Dead Space 2 and Dead Space 3 on Origin. The latter two games are so smooth and crisp, while Dead Space feels like you are dragging the weapon through the dirt when trying to aim at an enemy. The two minor issues are overshadowed by the game itself, but the input lag makes playing on Impossible mode more difficult than it should be, and Necromorphs are not slow... Nevertheless, those are my only criticisms for the game. While the last one is major, it isn't fair to the game to mark it down in its final grade since I certain its a port issue.Overall rating: A-. I love this game. Love love love it. To this day I still haven't played a game with a compelling enough story to keep me up the way this one did. This game has changed my life and has helped me truly appreciate horror games, and really good games in general. Absolutely check this game out, while is has some serious issues with the controls and minor problems with the pacing of horror and action, this game does a marvelous job at providing a fun, creepy and yet exciting masterpiece that I would recommend to everyone.

												Got to curb stomp an alien zombie baby. 10/10 would curbstomp again.But in all seriousness, I was on the hype train for this game when it first released in 2008. Spent hours watching trailers and gameplay videos before it finally released and it did not disappoint in the slightest. It made its way as one of the most memorable games to date for me. The atmosphere of the broken down ship, the suspended jump scares, the claustrophobia, the enemies and the intuitive design of attaching your health bar to your back to fully immerse you in this experience was done flawlessly. I may be a little biased but i am with good reason. Its a great game.			"

												This game is right around 7 years old now, but I am just now playing for the first time, and boy do I love it. The combat is not anything special and is a little slow paced, but that really isn't anything to complain about. The game looks damn good considering how old it is, but the best part about the game is the story. I really like the setting and atmosphere of the game. I enjoy finding the audio/video logs that explain the lore even further. The game does a good job pacing itself and I am always intrigued to find out what will happen next to the characters and how it will turn out in the end. The game itself really isn't all that scary, just with some cheap jumpscares and all, but is rather creepy and eerie. I think this is one of the best horror games in the past decade.The actual port of the game is decent. After the Vsync change that fixed a gamebreaking bug the game plays just fine. I personally use a wired 360 controller because I just wasn't a fan of the default key layout and did't want to deal with the mouse sensitivity/acceleration problems. Other than those 2 issues I have had no other problems.I give Dead Space a solid 9/10			"

The atmosphere is very convincing as the game is claustrophobic, eerie, dark and truly sells that this is a ship in deep space.I'm not gonna talk about the ending :) buy the game and enjoy it for yourself don't let me ruin it!There are only two real criticisms I have about this game and they are more of nit-picks and my own personal feeling after having 70 hours in the game.The first issue I have is the lack of consistent action, as there are moments throughout the game with lengthy battles, and there are moments of about 5 solid minutes of not shooting something. While a bit disappointing, the horror often times fills up the gaps of action. Now with the horror my issue is it becomes a bit flat as the game progresses. The game uses the same gimick with slight changes for scares repeatedly, sometimes it works, but a couple hours in the game it gets a little stale. However that all changes when the new type of Necromorph is introduced and another curveball is thrown at you. My absolute biggest issue with this game is the controls. I don't know what happened with the conversion from Xbox 360 to PC, or may it's just steam being bad, but there is some SERIOUS input lag with the mouse. There is a grossly notable delay in moving the mouse when compared to Dead Space 2 and Dead Space 3 on Origin. The latter two games are so smooth and crisp, while Dead Space feels like you are dragging the weapon through the dirt when trying to aim at an enemy. The two minor issues are overshadowed by the game itself, but the input lag makes playing on Impossible mode more difficult than it should be, and Necromorphs are not slow... Nevertheless, those are my only criticisms for the game. While the last one is major, it isn't fair to the game to mark it down in its final grade since I certain its a port issue.Overall rating: A-. I love this game. Love love love it. To this day I still haven't played a game with a compelling enough story to keep me up the way this one did. This game has changed my life and has helped me truly appreciate horror games, and really good games in general. Absolutely check this game out, while is has some serious issues with the controls and minor problems with the pacing of horror and action, this game does a marvelous job at providing a fun, creepy and yet exciting masterpiece that I would recommend to everyone.

												This game is right around 7 years old now, but I am just now playing for the first time, and boy do I love it. The combat is not anything special and is a little slow paced, but that really isn't anything to complain about. The game looks damn good considering how old it is, but the best part about the game is the story. I really like the setting and atmosphere of the game. I enjoy finding the audio/video logs that explain the lore even further. The game does a good job pacing itself and I am always intrigued to find out what will happen next to the characters and how it will turn out in the end. The game itself really isn't all that scary, just with some cheap jumpscares and all, but is rather creepy and eerie. I think this is one of the best horror games in the past decade.The actual port of the game is decent. After the Vsync change that fixed a gamebreaking bug the game plays just fine. I personally use a wired 360 controller because I just wasn't a fan of the default key layout and did't want to deal with the mouse sensitivity/acceleration problems. Other than those 2 issues I have had no other problems.I give Dead Space a solid 9/10			"

												A fan of the horror genre has to appreciate the difficulty that game developers and film-makers have in creating a true horror atmosphere that isn't entirely reliant on gore and jump-scares. With that in mind, as a true-blue horror fan across all mediums, I am VERY forgiving of trash and, in fact, even rather fond of it. Horror can be campy and hilarious, it can be hard-hitting and metaphorical, it can be deeply satirical and subversive or it can be, as I said, mindless gruesome trash and still be entertaining.Dead Space, however, is not trash.Dead Space is true horror.Dead Space is the 21st Century's answer to 1979 masterpiece Alien and it deserves the same status, fandom and accolade.I played Dead Space when it came out and I still find it to be a fabulously clunky, unrelenting and an unflinching horror masterpiece. In the face of legions of fast, intelligent and resilient ancient alien demons, Dead Space puts you in the shoes of - not a soldier, not a superhero, not a warrior - a ♥♥♥♥ing engineer. As you would expect, prepare to get the absolute ♥♥♥♥ kicked out of you. When you play Dead Space you feel every movement. You have to thrash your arms wildly to survive, run like hell and sometimes you have stomp an enemy over and over and over because they just. Will. Not. Die. I love this. It gave me true insight into actually how many times I would die in (God forbid) a situation like this, and how many horrendous ways there are to die. There are many, and they were very creative.Unfortunately, the series didn't manage to continue the success that Dead Space 1 reached in tone and atmosphere, but I would argue that this game is so good at instilling fear into a player that it can be forgiven for all it's subsequent sins. It is also very hard. It is as much a work of the horror-genre for horror fans as it is a game for gamers.Casuals need not apply.			"

												This game is the best of both the horror and action genre. It mixes so many good elements to scare you through suspense, jump scares, gore, fear and the big broader threat that everyone could die if you aren’t successful. Dead Space has set the standard for Sci-Fi Survival/Horror and its name stills sends shivers down the backs of gamers almost a decade later. The game starts with you, Isaac Clark, with a maintenance crew attending to the distress call on the U.S.G. Ishimura; a massive mining ship. Things go south quickly as the ship crashed into the main hanger and the crew is nowhere to be found. Throughout your struggle to restore functions to the ship and find out what happened you have constant deadly problems to deal with. This game is very original in the way the threats develop and you deal with them. There are sequences where you have to solve zero-g puzzles, mazes in zero-g, fight enemies with unique abilities, time very careful threats from the decaying ship and use the full range of your abilities. The game has 12 chapters, which you can finish in about an hour each making it great to set down with natural pauses. The game has upgrades from the stores found around the ships and you need to balance your credits and upgrade pick-ups with your need for ammunition and health throughout the game. One of my personal favorite mechanics in this game has to do with the soundtrack changing from the ambience to combat music. Most games start combat music when you enter a room or an enemy spawns. In Dead Space, with the exception of cut scenes, the combat music doesn’t start until you almost make eye contact with an enemy. This makes it terrifying when that one enemy that you missed comes up behind you and grabs you suddenly out of the nice ambient space music. There are also many sequences when you are in the vacuum of space and the game lets you only hear one sound, Isaac’s breathing. Unless you see the enemy coming, he’ll be behind you. The most immersive aspect of the game is the face that there is really no HUD. Your health is displayed as a series of bars on the back of Isaac’s armor and when looking at your inventory he projects the screen from his armor rather than the game opening a menu. Overall, the game is a wonderful, immersive sci-fi survival/horror game that has really set the bar for its unique niche. I would highly recommend it and play it in a dark room with headphones all the way up in the dead of night.			"

												Got to curb stomp an alien zombie baby. 10/10 would curbstomp again.But in all seriousness, I was on the hype train for this game when it first released in 2008. Spent hours watching trailers and gameplay videos before it finally released and it did not disappoint in the slightest. It made its way as one of the most memorable games to date for me. The atmosphere of the broken down ship, the suspended jump scares, the claustrophobia, the enemies and the intuitive design of attaching your health bar to your back to fully immerse you in this experience was done flawlessly. I may be a little biased but i am with good reason. Its a great game.			"

Just walk slowly so you won't get a heart attack.3. Conserve your ammo. Aim his head (oh wait that doesnt work), ok then, aim his limb (wtf, you still not died yet?), Alright, shoot him with all you've got.4. Don't panic if you hear voice but you can't see the enemy.

Having to fix the Vsync issue was no big deal, but the game kept crashing all through out the game if I didn't save frequently which sucked (Was using windows 10 if that has anything to do with it)- M+K Controls are pretty terrible. I would recommend a Xbox remote if you have one.- Several of the storys plot points were straight ripped from System Shock 2. Not done any where near as well though.- Characters are boring for the most part- Wasn't all that scary to me. Overall this is a really good survival horror game.

												Dead Space is a gem as in a horror/action game, and to give you an idea what it is like, is that it is a mixture of doom and resident evil. The story is creepy and well made and the gameplay is pretty good ( would have been perfect if the controls for pc was not werid and you can adjust the senseitifity of the gamepad) and the atmosphere is very strong for this one. To me this game is not super scary but it does has its moments like the faint singing of a woman singing twinkle twinkle little star in the backround on chapter 6 and 10. This game is also super gory, so if you have a weak stomach than good luck :). Some of the missions are annoying but worth it in the long run. Overall I give this game (in my opinon) a 8/10.

												Replayed this in 2016 after being reminded by it in the ‘EDGE special edition – the 100 greatest video games’, not having touched it since release. Incredibly it stands up enormously today, both in terms of gameplay, graphics, and story. The integration with the game world is complete, focusing on survival, exploration, and tightly choreographed bouts of intense combat. In particular, the sound and monster design is out of this world, making it just as creepy and unsettling as it was back in 2008. While some critics prefer the sequel, I would liken it to the comparison of the film Alien, and Aliens; essentially suspense vs. action.Of the material that inspired it, Alien I strongly prefer, and if like me, you enjoy being sucked into a realistic world of terror in space, this is the one for you.

For a horror fan, this game is a must. The atmosphere this title manages to evoke is amongst some of the best I've ever come across in my 20-year gaming career. If you're a fan of The Thing, Event Horizon, Alien, anything along those lines, you will *relish* the game's mixture of music, storytelling and pace. The fact that I've just finished my god-knows-how-many-th run through here in 2015 having thoroughly enjoyed every minute really underlines how well the devs did.The game does like it's share of jump scares but I found it didn't overdo them - rather than go down Doom 3's route of continuously letting loose horrors from hidden cabinets, half the time the game lets your own head do it's work for you - you'll glimpse things rushing down corridors, you'll hear whispers in the dark without any clear source, every so often something will clang and crash. It's classic horror stuff of messing with your head to make the reveal all the better. The game drip-feeds it's story by way of audio logs, footage, and gradual exposition across what used to be a place where it's crew worked and lived, as you slowly learn what the f*** happened on this doomed ship, and the excellent voice acting really pushes the script in the right direction. Technically, it's a fairly standard third-person shooter - much of the ruckus about how your character is an average blue-collar Parker-from-Alien engineer thrown into a nightmarish ghost ship crawling with horrific entities is fairly thin, as your 'improvised engineering tools' can be turned into shockingly devastating instruments of destruction (quite what a miner needs a giant particle cannon for is explained as, um, shooting rocks... yeah, makes you wonder how fast and ferocious rocks are in the future) but none of that is really important - expect a gameplay pace sitting somewhere between Mass Effect 1 and Gears of War with *very* rough narrative outline and atmosphere similar to System Shock 2. Intially playing like a Survival Horror, padding down corridors with a palpable feeling that you are only alive by sheer luck with precious little kit, the game steadily becomes more and more action-packed with Isaac the Engineer undergoing some serious nerd rage, upgrading his contraptions to fight ever more gross and numerous monsters that take leaves out of pretty much every sci-fi horror of the last 20 years.But don't play this for the simple gameplay, as entertaining as it is. Play it to enjoy a truly awesome sci-fi horror and wish that the gaming industry produced half as much as this stuff as it did CoD clones.Then play it's sequel. Like me. :D			"

												This is one of my favourite games. The designers, artists, and developers at Visceral Games (formerly Redwood Shores) just nailed it perfectly.The whole idea of the universe, the atmosphere, the story, the location, the main character, the enemies, the weapons, the graphics and sounds, the TPS view, the ""HUD""; basically I feel that everything about this game is in the right place.I think you're a fool if you skip this (and don't forget that you need to play it on the hardest difficulty)! :)			"

												Excellent horror/adventure game with some good jumpscares. Especially the music in this game makes it so scary along with the nightmarish environment . The story was great with a good twist in the end. The only bad thing in the game was that you had to backtrack a lot. Which made it sometimes boring because you had already seen it.			"

												Dead Space conjures up the claustrophobic ambient terror that the first Alien movie did so well. You will simultaneously dread and relish turning each corner, and breathe a sigh of relief each time you discover a shop or save point.For added immersion, I played Dead Space in 3D with Nvidia 3D Vision, and it worked really well with this game. The smoky glare as the light from your plasma cutter disappears into the murky corridors makes you feel like you're looking through a window into a nightmare.			"

												I didn't play it straight through as I like to play later at night or whatever to set the atmosphere, but I did eventually get through the whole thing. (this won't be a thorough review because of this and since its been a little while).The horror aspect was well intigrated into the work: actually a legitimate tense horror game by my taste, without really overdoing anything. And, the shooter aspect of the game was not overexagerated.It was difficult at times, but as a whole it was just the right amount of challenging ^-^I haven't gotten into the after beating the game stuff, but I really have nothing to complain about with this one.The closest thing I have to a regret on this one is not buying the second in the same sale xD,but if I ever need another horror game, I know where I might start.

												I originally played this game on the  Xbox; and purchased it on Steam for a nostalgic replay. I got way more than just the nostalgia! The game aged well with it's storyline and I was still jumping from ther monsters surprising me! I would recommend this game as a necessity to a game library for its story immersion and gameplay. As you go through the levels you can tell the developers put a lot of love into the game with it's hidden Easter eggs, detail on each level, weapon upgrade system, and the backstory added to supplement the story. You do need to play through a second time to unlock the full backstory logs but it was worth it!One con is working the third person camera is difficult to use to see where you want to see. This happened very rarely so for me it is a forgivable annoyance.I played this game with an Xbox One controller (which required no set up) and I used a mouse for some of the in game challenges that required a more exact aim since I am not as good at aiming with a controller.

												Excellent game, decent enough story and moderate challenge, also has a huge array of weapons and upgrades to help you mow down the creepy crawlies. Good pacing, level design and plenty of tension. The characters are a bit cliched, but it's more about the atmosphere then anything else. Issac is mute, some people like it, some don't, but in my opinion, it helps keep the lonely atmosphere.The pc port could've been done better, like a lot better. It's certainly feels like the controls were rushed, and it doesn't appear possible to remap the gamepad controls (which, by the way, doesn't have a quick heal key assigned, even though it does on consle, which makes playing higher difficulties impposible on a gamepad, seeing as this feature is basically neccesary) meaing you're really only gonna be able to play it on mouse/keyboard, even though it was certainly not designed with it in mind. Not to mention achievments have been seemingly removed, and although it's not too big a deal, it's still an odd thing to do.All in all, pc port is kinda weak, but the game is certainly worth playing regardless.

												Dead Space is a game, which ignites my memories of films like Aliens, Lost In Space, and other movies with isolated, or abandoned space vessels.At first I found Dead Space boring, but on my 3rd play-through I eventually got hooked and started to increase further into the game, and story. Dead Space is amazingly eerie, and you have that 'alone' space feeling through-out the main campaign. As I got further into the main story I found myself getting hooked, and thinking to myself 'WOW'! This game is incredible, and for anyone that likes old space movies from the early 80's/90's, then this is the game for you!The plot of Dead Space is simple. You are sent with a crew to investigate a planet mining vessel that sent out a request for help. The game starts with you arriving at that vessel and then you begin to find out what happened, and why the help signal was sent. Not all is as seems however - as the badly damaged vessel seems to be empty upon arrival - Or is it?The story has many twists and turns. It's a story about experimentation, love, and 'what happens when things go wrong'.Dead Space is great! It's thrilling, inventive, and the level-up system, and skill tree is genius.This game is so alike to the scene in 'Lost In Space' when they arrive at the abandoned Space vessel. If you haven't watched Lost In Space, and you haven't played Dead Space - then you NEED to.I rate this game 10/10.			"

												Dead Space is one of my all-time favorites, and in a true sense a masterpiece. I bought and played it upon its original release, and it was pretty much bug free and stable out of the box, even if it pushed my trusty old Core2Duo I had then pretty hard.The design choices, story line (augmented by a couple of animated movies ,""Dead Space: Downfall"" and ""Dead Space: Aftermath""), atmosphere, and gritty industrial Sci-Fi environment, make this a memorable, terrifying, and unique experience. Think of it as an amalgamation of Aliens, Event Horizon, The Thing, and Pandorum. It does have some jump scares, but mainly all the adversaries are manageable, especially since you get to upgrade your gear throughout.You definitely get the feeling of being in space, in particularly due to the very, very awesome Zero-G sequences, and your requirement for Oxygen and the ability to magnetize your boots. This is pretty unique in games, and certainly was a novelty back when Dead Space was released. This is probably the fourth time I've bought the game, for one due to DRM-freeness, and because it's worth it. Of all the games published by EA over the years, the Dead Space (and Mass Effect) franchises are certainly one of the best games ever made.In fact, the only negative I have to say about Dead Space is the ridiculous control/button assignments. Being left handed I do not use WASD, I use the cursor, and surrounding keys, and Dead Space isn't very helpful there. I had to get a program called GlovePIE which I've had to use a few times since. Once setup though, everything works just fine.In conclusion, if you are a Sci-Fi/Horror fan, enjoy a good third person shooter style experience, and enjoy roaming around in beautiful, atmospheric environments, then this is for you! And remember: In space, no one can hear you scream!			"

												This is a heartwarming game about a man named Isaac Clarke going to a large spaceship and finding himself. He interacts with many of the passengers on the ship and makes many friends. He even reuinites with his love, whom had joined the space station much sooner than he. This game teaches us the value of friendship and kindness and displays messages of love and tolerance throughout the story. Overall this game is just a superb work of art that captures the essence of what it is to be human and generally just uplifts your spirit the entire time. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you will fall in love with this touching tale.Also theres flesh eating monsters...			"

The game features a distress call, a seemingly silent ship which we quickly realize is dark and full of monsters. Something has gone terribly wrong.The game's carefully crafted atmosphere and surprisingly good voice acting are really what draw you in. Although the plot is very transparent, and the character development (especially for Kendra) is a little weak, the game isn't really about that. It's about living out some version of the space horror fantasy you've had in your head ever since the first time you saw say, Event Horizon. The game has it all, spooky lighting, creepy cultists, a wide array of frightening monsters, and a slowing unfolding backstory involving a typical breakdown of the chain of command and descent into chaos.Playing this game with headphones and in the dark, while alone, even a second time through, is quite an experience. Your heart will pound and you will jump out of your seat.Graphically speaking the game isn't much to look at, and the necromorphs aren't very inspired in their design, although they are scary. Nevertheless, the lighting and audio more than make up for the game's low resolution textures and low poly models.Apart from really wonky object physics, the game feels very good to play as well. The slow turning speed of Isaac, your avatar, contributes to the sense of the game as being about horror/survival, and scavenging is essential. You aren't incredibly vulnerable, especially after upgrades, but you feel like you are, and that's what counts.Ultimately, Dead Space is a surprising and fun guilty pleasure of a game that will remind you of nights spent watching sci-fi horror movies scaring yourself senseless in the dark.

												This game is quite the terrifying single player adventure, and is intensely creepy playing by yourself in a room devoid of any light but from your computer monitor. You get that feeling of horror for your protagonist practically everywhere you go because you're not exactly certain what to expect next. You will soon learn to fear for the life of your digital protagonist after witnessing one death animation. Especially since you are isolated from the small crew you arrived with for the majority of the time. You will encounter torrid creatures that threaten the lives of you and your crew. You will be seperated from comforting human contact or support for substantial lengths of time. Your mission will take you to a massive mining vessel whose crew of roughly thirteen-hundred strong has ""disappeared"". First and foremost, you must survive using problems solving techniques and careful application of defensive resources. If you succeed, you will uncover the truth as to what happened on the mining vessel and the events that transpired before the collapse.This title is now on my recurring list of games to play as the years go by, and I'm quite certain the sequels will be as well.

												Only 5 hours in and already I can say: Fantastic, fantastic game, terrible port.I had to go through about two hours of fixing V-sync issues through online guides, and eventually even using my graphics card's control pannel to override the in-game anti-aliasing as it blurred up the screen. If you play with a controller things are a little easier, but somehow they screwed that up too. The game is obviously meant for a controller, but if you use an Xbox controller, the game adds a huge ""dead zone"" to the middle of the right joystick, meaning you need to aim with only the edges of the joystick. And even if you fix THAT, which you can't fix totally, there's no way in game to change joystick sensitivity, I don't know why, so you are stuck with  the default, slow as heck sensitivity that makes it impossible to make it very far on Hard without using up almost all of your ammo.Great game, terrible controls and port.

												11 hours to play through the story on medium difficulty.Dead Space has a decent story & good atmosphere though it is more action than horror. About a third of the way in you become too powerful, save for a regenerating enemy, which reduces the tension further so it might be better to start on a harder difficulty. Controls are a bit awkward & the bosses are a little underwelming , still worth a playthrough.Also there's stomping zombie babies.			"

It's very linear, mostly go to point A do something, go to point B, etc. The jump scares are good but the very best moments are when you panic because you don't have enough ammo to kill everything and have to run to find ammo and/or get creative.Very recommended, 9/10			"

												Dead Space is a gem as in a horror/action game, and to give you an idea what it is like, is that it is a mixture of doom and resident evil. The story is creepy and well made and the gameplay is pretty good ( would have been perfect if the controls for pc was not werid and you can adjust the senseitifity of the gamepad) and the atmosphere is very strong for this one. To me this game is not super scary but it does has its moments like the faint singing of a woman singing twinkle twinkle little star in the backround on chapter 6 and 10. This game is also super gory, so if you have a weak stomach than good luck :). Some of the missions are annoying but worth it in the long run. Overall I give this game (in my opinon) a 8/10. Also look at the chapter names and write down each begining letter and you are in for a treat!			"

												If you've been living under an asteroid for the past decade, this is a really, really frightening game. It is very atmospheric, one of the games selling points. Oh and the soundtrack doesn't do anything to help calm the nerves. The gameplay is a bit linear, though this isn't essentially bad, as this unleashes a majority of the game's scares. The weapon range is amiable, although most players will be satisfied with the plasma cutter.The story is fairly cluttered, although the mysterious origins behind the Ishimura is welcome ambiguity. The graphics and art direction are both effective and coherent, in particular the gorgeously horrific character models. Although the enemies do get a bit repetitive, the developer's reasoning behind intensifying things through plotting you against overwhelming quantities is...refreshing. This is an excellent horror shooter, with the only flaws being its lack of enemy and weapon variety and its linearity. Oh, and look behind you.8/10			"

												Dead Space is a game, which ignites my memories of films like Aliens, Lost In Space, and other movies with isolated, or abandoned space vessels.At first I found Dead Space boring, but on my 3rd play-through I eventually got hooked and started to increase further into the game, and story. Dead Space is amazingly eerie, and you have that 'alone' space feeling through-out the main campaign. As I got further into the main story I found myself getting hooked, and thinking to myself 'WOW'! This game is incredible, and for anyone that likes old space movies from the early 80's/90's, then this is the game for you!The plot of Dead Space is simple. You are sent with a crew to investigate a planet mining vessel that sent out a request for help. The game starts with you arriving at that vessel and then you begin to find out what happened, and why the help signal was sent. Not all is as seems however - as the badly damaged vessel seems to be empty upon arrival - Or is it?The story has many twists and turns. It's a story about experimentation, love, and 'what happens when things go wrong'.Dead Space is great! It's thrilling, inventive, and the level-up system, and skill tree is genius.This game is so alike to the scene in 'Lost In Space' when they arrive at the abandoned Space vessel. If you haven't watched Lost In Space, and you haven't played Dead Space - then you NEED to.I rate this game 10/10.			"

												Dead Space is one of my all-time favorites, and in a true sense a masterpiece. I bought and played it upon its original release, and it was pretty much bug free and stable out of the box, even if it pushed my trusty old Core2Duo I had then pretty hard.The design choices, story line (augmented by a couple of animated movies ,""Dead Space: Downfall"" and ""Dead Space: Aftermath""), atmosphere, and gritty industrial Sci-Fi environment, make this a memorable, terrifying, and unique experience. Think of it as an amalgamation of Aliens, Event Horizon, The Thing, and Pandorum. It does have some jump scares, but mainly all the adversaries are manageable, especially since you get to upgrade your gear throughout.You definitely get the feeling of being in space, in particularly due to the very, very awesome Zero-G sequences, and your requirement for Oxygen and the ability to magnetize your boots. This is pretty unique in games, and certainly was a novelty back when Dead Space was released. This is probably the fourth time I've bought the game, for one due to DRM-freeness, and because it's worth it. Of all the games published by EA over the years, the Dead Space (and Mass Effect) franchises are certainly one of the best games ever made.In fact, the only negative I have to say about Dead Space is the ridiculous control/button assignments. Being left handed I do not use WASD, I use the cursor, and surrounding keys, and Dead Space isn't very helpful there. I had to get a program called GlovePIE which I've had to use a few times since. Once setup though, everything works just fine.In conclusion, if you are a Sci-Fi/Horror fan, enjoy a good third person shooter style experience, and enjoy roaming around in beautiful, atmospheric environments, then this is for you!

												Excellent game, decent enough story and moderate challenge, also has a huge array of weapons and upgrades to help you mow down the creepy crawlies. Good pacing, level design and plenty of tension. The characters are a bit cliched, but it's more about the atmosphere then anything else. Issac is mute, some people like it, some don't, but in my opinion, it helps keep the lonely atmosphere.The pc port could've been done better, like a lot better. It's certainly feels like the controls were rushed, and it doesn't appear possible to remap the gamepad controls (which, by the way, doesn't have a quick heal key assigned, even though it does on consle, which makes playing higher difficulties impposible on a gamepad, seeing as this feature is basically neccesary) meaing you're really only gonna be able to play it on mouse/keyboard, even though it was certainly not designed with it in mind. Not to mention achievments have been seemingly removed, and although it's not too big a deal, it's still an odd thing to do.All in all, pc port is kinda weak, but the game is certainly worth playing regardless.

												I originally played this game on the  Xbox; and purchased it on Steam for a nostalgic replay. I got way more than just the nostalgia! The game aged well with it's storyline and I was still jumping from ther monsters surprising me! I would recommend this game as a necessity to a game library for its story immersion and gameplay. As you go through the levels you can tell the developers put a lot of love into the game with it's hidden Easter eggs, detail on each level, weapon upgrade system, and the backstory added to supplement the story. You do need to play through a second time to unlock the full backstory logs but it was worth it!One con is working the third person camera is difficult to use to see where you want to see. This happened very rarely so for me it is a forgivable annoyance.I played this game with an Xbox One controller (which required no set up) and I used a mouse for some of the in game challenges that required a more exact aim since I am not as good at aiming with a controller.

												If you are looking for a good horror game ... this one is the right choice ,I love horror games , I mean I really can't play a horror game without turning off all the lights and play alone ... Just to get the best out of the game ... most horror games nowadays try to scare the player by making something jump on the screen or a random unnecessary scream sound ... they are trying to scare the player rather than scaring the game character ...but in Dead Space you'll feel what your game character feeling .the scare , the Insanity , The Fear ....However ,If there is a thing I didn't like in the game ,It would be the FOV the character is very close tho the screen ,But you can solve this by a tweak called ( Widescreen Fixer ) . but it would be nice if it was fixed by the Developers . Plus a few bugs . Anyway My Rating for this game is :Dead Space - ( 7 / 10 ) "

												Don't buy this game, it's too scary and you'll have to fight space monsters and stuff. You get sweet guns and kill a bunch of things before they try to kill you. Why in the hell did they dock on this stupid ship in the first place? Didn't they have enough technology to maybe scan the ship and realize there is a bunch of crazy ♥♥♥♥ happening? Like, no way would I be going on a big ♥♥♥ ship in the middle of space. ""Oh we lost contact, better send 3 people to go find out what's up!""... yeah nothing could go wrong thereBut anyway, cool game, cool guns, controls can kinda be janky.8/10 - you should go buy it, ignore what I said earlier.

												This is a masterpiece of a game and one of my all time favorites, its the thing, event horizon and sillent hill all rolled into one big gore fest, its not the scariest of games but it does cause a few jumps when a creature sneaks up on you and gets up close just as you turn around, and panic can set in when your ammo is nearly spent whilst wiping out a large wave of creatures. This game still look great, the detail and lighting on the ishimura decks is so atmospheric and the creatures are so fantastically squelchy and gross it makes me wonder if many vegetarians can actually play this game without feeling ill.10/10 Full of meaty goodness.

												As a shooter, sure, I can definitely recommend this, but don't go into this game expecting horror. Maybe I'm just not affected by it but I didn't find what I've played so far to be scary in any way. I don't mean that as trying to say I'm tough either. I'd never played a horror game or seen a horror movie before and actually wanted to try one out to see if I'd enjoy it. What I got was dark corridors and the occasional jumpscare. I eventually grew to expect them as well. At one point I was in an elevator and took a few seconds to stretch. When the doors opened I saw a mutant, and wasn't surprised at all. I calmly reached for my mouse and took aim.Again, as a shooter, I think this game does a great job. You're encouraged to stay far from enemies and when you shoot you're told to dismember them for more damage. The game does a pretty good job of setting the atmosphere as well.One fallback I saw with it were the ragdoll physics. Maybe its just the time it came out but they seemed silly. I'd kill an enemy and go to walk past, only to have its body stick between my legs and vibrate. I don't think its that big of a deal, but if you do, be warned.If you're looking for something to scare you I suggest finding something else. However, as a dark mystery sci-fi adventure, I can safely say its not bad.			"

It combines the story of RE 1 with the aim mode from RE 4.This game deserves a solid 8, maybe a 9.			"

												Replayed this in 2016 after being reminded by it in the ‘EDGE special edition – the 100 greatest video games’, not having touched it since release. Incredibly it stands up enormously today, both in terms of gameplay, graphics, and story. The integration with the game world is complete, focusing on survival, exploration, and tightly choreographed bouts of intense combat. In particular, the sound and monster design is out of this world, making it just as creepy and unsettling as it was back in 2008. While some critics prefer the sequel, I would liken it to the comparison of the film Alien, and Aliens; essentially suspense vs. action.Of the material that inspired it, Alien I strongly prefer, and if like me, you enjoy being sucked into a realistic world of terror in space, this is the one for you.

												I decided to have another run through of this gem over Halloween - I've owned various copies on various platforms over the years but figured it might as well refresh my memory from my first playthrough back in 2008. For a horror fan, this game is a must. The atmosphere this title manages to evoke is amongst some of the best I've ever come across in my 20-year gaming career. If you're a fan of The Thing, Event Horizon, Alien, anything along those lines, you will *relish* the game's mixture of music, storytelling and pace. The fact that I've just finished my god-knows-how-many-th run through here in 2015 having thoroughly enjoyed every minute really underlines how well the devs did.The game does like it's share of jump scares but I found it didn't overdo them - rather than go down Doom 3's route of continuously letting loose horrors from hidden cabinets, half the time the game lets your own head do it's work for you - you'll glimpse things rushing down corridors, you'll hear whispers in the dark without any clear source, every so often something will clang and crash. It's classic horror stuff of messing with your head to make the reveal all the better. The game drip-feeds it's story by way of audio logs, footage, and gradual exposition across what used to be a place where it's crew worked and lived, as you slowly learn what the f*** happened on this doomed ship, and the excellent voice acting really pushes the script in the right direction. Technically, it's a fairly standard third-person shooter - much of the ruckus about how your character is an average blue-collar Parker-from-Alien engineer thrown into a nightmarish ghost ship crawling with horrific entities is fairly thin, as your 'improvised engineering tools' can be turned into shockingly devastating instruments of destruction (quite what a miner needs a giant particle cannon for is explained as, um, shooting rocks... yeah, makes you wonder how fast and ferocious rocks are in the future) but none of that is really important - expect a gameplay pace sitting somewhere between Mass Effect 1 and Gears of War with *very* rough narrative outline and atmosphere similar to System Shock 2. Intially playing like a Survival Horror, padding down corridors with a palpable feeling that you are only alive by sheer luck with precious little kit, the game steadily becomes more and more action-packed with Isaac the Engineer undergoing some serious nerd rage, upgrading his contraptions to fight ever more gross and numerous monsters that take leaves out of pretty much every sci-fi horror of the last 20 years.But don't play this for the simple gameplay, as entertaining as it is. Play it to enjoy a truly awesome sci-fi horror and wish that the gaming industry produced half as much as this stuff as it did CoD clones.Then play it's sequel. Like me. :D			"

												All around fun alien space shooter, with of course the jump scares and the music scares all in there too. I would say a very enjoyable game but at the least because of its bugs, mostly with people with very high end computers. If you're going to play this I ensure you to have VSYNC ON. Or certain things in the game won't commence. Other than that little problem. It's an amazing game and I'd reccomend it.			"

												""Aliens"", ""The Thing"" and ""Event Horizon"" had a baby.  This is where it all began. Forget the second and third games in the series, the first entry is it's own unique entry in the series before going completely off the rails by the third installment. What differentiates it is that the original game despite the gross-out horror and violent gore is that it is more story-driven than it's successors. The entire game plays out like a science-fiction horror film in deep space, richly establishing it's own universe and characters well before the other shoe drops, our woe-begotten protagonist and two others with him finding themselves stranded on a failing derelict ship that they had been searching for and finding no crew aboard but blood all over the place..then finding out that they're less alone than they thought and quickly having to fix the ailing ship to save themselves while defending themselves from terrifying nightmarish creatures. It sounds like a cheesy 80s thriller when I describe it that way but it's so much more than that and considering it often goes on sale for like 5 bucks these days you're certainly in for a treat.

												Wonderfully immersive and exciting. A true horror thriller with a nice twist of 3rd person action.For a long time i had played the IOS version of Dead Space, and loved almost everything about it - the graphics, the style, the action, the jump scares... I could go on! However, it lacked immersion due to the touch controls and how itd take up most the screen controlling Issac.However, when i then saw that Humble Bundle was selling this along side DS2 & DS3, i was over the moon - finally i would be able to play my favourite franchise (depsite never having even played the PC versions). A year passed and i had yet to play the game on my PC (a HP Pavillion Intel Pentium laptop, i think you can understand why), so when i bought a PS3, i once again bought DS1&DS2.Now here is why i have brought all this up - the controls. The games graphics and gameplay is stunning, however it may take you a while to learn the auxilliary controls on keyboard. Whereas there are 16 buttons max on a PS3/4 Controller, there are 80+ keys on a keyboard, which are not always the easiest to reach from WASD, so when accessing the mission log, map or objectives, it can be a pain remembering which keys are which and stretching to reach them. Sure you could remap the keys, but then once again youd be having to learn them again.Otherwise, this game is stunning, with a thrilling story and plenty of jump scares, and a real sense of terror.

												Dead Space is one of my all-time favorites, and in a true sense a masterpiece. I bought and played it upon its original release, and it was pretty much bug free and stable out of the box, even if it pushed my trusty old Core2Duo I had then pretty hard.The design choices, story line (augmented by a couple of animated movies ,""Dead Space: Downfall"" and ""Dead Space: Aftermath""), atmosphere, and gritty industrial Sci-Fi environment, make this a memorable, terrifying, and unique experience. Think of it as an amalgamation of Aliens, Event Horizon, The Thing, and Pandorum. It does have some jump scares, but mainly all the adversaries are manageable, especially since you get to upgrade your gear throughout.You definitely get the feeling of being in space, in particularly due to the very, very awesome Zero-G sequences, and your requirement for Oxygen and the ability to magnetize your boots. This is pretty unique in games, and certainly was a novelty back when Dead Space was released. This is probably the fourth time I've bought the game, for one due to DRM-freeness, and because it's worth it. Of all the games published by EA over the years, the Dead Space (and Mass Effect) franchises are certainly one of the best games ever made.In fact, the only negative I have to say about Dead Space is the ridiculous control/button assignments. Being left handed I do not use WASD, I use the cursor, and surrounding keys, and Dead Space isn't very helpful there. I had to get a program called GlovePIE which I've had to use a few times since. Once setup though, everything works just fine.In conclusion, if you are a Sci-Fi/Horror fan, enjoy a good third person shooter style experience, and enjoy roaming around in beautiful, atmospheric environments, then this is for you! And remember: In space, no one can hear you scream!			"

												A game that is visually great, neat monsters, more of the scary fps type of game more so than the bullets-blazing type of game, but sadly thrown together with a horrible control and aiming system, cramped cropped 3rd person over the shoulder shooting that restricts line of sight and correct tactics and aiming, and together you have a beautiful game that might have been great but sadly has none of the controls or abilities that most shooter type games similar to this have. All flash, no bang. Its well worth the price to get it on sale to see if you can stomach the controls enough to play it a while, some do, some don't. Dead Space 2 i hear fixes this problem but you do have it in dead space. I recommend the game since it a good price on sale, but sadly i got bored with the bad controls and fov very quick and didn't even feel like trogging through more of the same for a half dozen more chapters. Bad controls will turn me off a game very quick.			"

												If you've been living under an asteroid for the past decade, this is a really, really frightening game. It is very atmospheric, one of the games selling points. Oh and the soundtrack doesn't do anything to help calm the nerves. The gameplay is a bit linear, though this isn't essentially bad, as this unleashes a majority of the game's scares. The weapon range is amiable, although most players will be satisfied with the plasma cutter.The story is fairly cluttered, although the mysterious origins behind the Ishimura is welcome ambiguity. The graphics and art direction are both effective and coherent, in particular the gorgeously horrific character models. Although the enemies do get a bit repetitive, the developer's reasoning behind intensifying things through plotting you against overwhelming quantities is...refreshing. This is an excellent horror shooter, with the only flaws being its lack of enemy and weapon variety and its linearity. Oh, and look behind you.8/10			"

												I'm not a fan of jumpscare, but this game has an interesting gameplay. It's less scary when you know the enemies and what to expect (basically if you already watched videos). If you can make it through the first level, the following levels will feel less scary (although the game will still manage to startle you). The controls (character movement and mouse control) are kind of like GTA or any other TPS (Third Person Shooter) you might have played. You can use your mouse to move the camera around your character. Although the mouse control might feel weird and slow at first, you should be able to get used to it. I still had to set mouse sensitivity to 80% though.			"

												If you are looking for a good horror game ... this one is the right choice ,I love horror games , I mean I really can't play a horror game without turning off all the lights and play alone ... Just to get the best out of the game ... most horror games nowadays try to scare the player by making something jump on the screen or a random unnecessary scream sound ... they are trying to scare the player rather than scaring the game character ...but in Dead Space you'll feel what your game character feeling .the scare , the Insanity , The Fear ....However ,If there is a thing I didn't like in the game ,It would be the FOV the character is very close tho the screen ,But you can solve this by a tweak called ( Widescreen Fixer ) . but it would be nice if it was fixed by the Developers . Plus a few bugs . Anyway My Rating for this game is :Dead Space - ( 7 / 10 ) "

												Alien meets The Thing in 'Dead Space'. It doesn't escape horror cliche through its narrative, but its execution is brilliant - the immersive HUD, chilling sound design and music and grotesque monsters are a compelling combination. There are some memorable low gravity sequences too and, generally speaking, the pacing is consistent enough to allow the finale to pay off. Weapons are fun to use and I liked the emphasis on skill shots to limbs, rather than dishing out the firepower arbitrarily. This is all rounded up by a basic but effective upgrades system and the ability to slow objects and enemies down with Stasis, as well as move objects around with a Kinesis module.That said, it wasn't as frightening as I hoped it might be and was overly reliant on jump scares. Nothing really made me fear going round the next corner like other titles have. Tension failed to build as the game went on as the Necromorphs' tendancy to jump out of vents and stand behind doorways became predictable and noticeably scripted as the game went on. I think I only visibly flinched a couple of times during my 11 hour playthrough.Nonetheless, I had a lot of fun with this game and could really tell that a lot of very talented people were behind its creation. Would definitely recommend.			"

												I'm going to try to summarize the dead space experience.Slowly lose your sanity in a creepy atmosphere, face horrific monsters that require precision to kill, in an extremely frantic environment. Whispering voices in your head, Is anyone really alive or are you just imagining it? Seriously now, Dead space is a quality survival horror game, if you aren't careful your ammo will run dry and you'll be in big trouble, the jumpscares are there... but they're rare and far in between. The game changes pace in just the right places to keep you guessing what'll happen next. The story is simple, you crashed into the USG Ishimura and are trying to get back home. The characters you interact with are alright, some of them are there just to tell you what to do, then theres some that run the mad scientist trope, but all their lines are well written and the actors deliver with high credibility. If you have an old computer there wont be a problem, dead space's PC port is excellent and allows a smooth framerate with impressive visuals, not just for an old game.			"

												Despite having a lot of issues, Dead Space is still fun to play. It is not an amazing title by any means, but it gets the job done (barely).The Good:- The atmosphere is definitely the selling point of Dead Space. It is executed perfectly and it really conveys the feeling of ""Oh God... what happened to this place?""- The story is somewhere between ok to good depending on your perspective. I don't think it was an amazing story though.- Good characterization (minus the main character ironically).The Bad:- The combat is relatively oversimplified. There is no crouching. There are no stealth mechanics. There is no ""take the high ground for an advantage"" type of feeling. Tactical fighting is not present in Dead Space. Your goal during encounters is to dismember your enemies by destroying their limbs instead of aiming for their torso or head. Enemies are ""leashed"" to rooms, so if you find yourself in a tough fight all you have to do is step through a door and they cannot follow you. This really trivializes the game as you can bypass many enemies this way. - The location of your health bar is for some reason attached to your character (Dead Space is third-person). While this  looks cool, it does not work well in combat. For example, if you are backed into a wall by a group of opponents, you can no longer see your health bar and you have no idea how much damage you have taken. - As a port to PC, the controls are not fluid. Turning and moving around is not completely smooth. I had to adjust the mouse sensitivity multiple times in certain areas because it was so difficult to move. Also, while using the Store Console, there is no mouse cursor present to select items you want to buy from the list. You cannot scroll through the list with your mouse wheel. You have to manually use the arrow keys to scroll and choose your items. How can something as simple as a mouse cursor for a list of items not get implemented?- I found it very strange that the character you play as (Isaac) never says a single word the entire game (literally, he says nothing). Other characters even stop to ask you questions and talk to you but Isaac never responds. I find it hard to connect with a mute character. Also I think it's very important to connect with the main character so you care about what happens to him/her, but with Isaac presenting zero personality or speech, it is very difficult to care about him.- Considering how unique the enemies are that you fight, I would have thought EA could have created some very cool boss fights or interesting mechanics. The boss fights though were massively disappointing and not interesting.Overall, Dead Space is carried by it's perfectly executed atmosphere and well-paced horror gameplay. The game is actually pretty good, but the unresponsive controls and a couple of poor UI choices are noticeably detrimental. As a side note, the story (not the gameplay) of Dead Space and the way it unfolds is scary similar to System Shock 2 (probably 85% of the concept of Dead Space is the same concept as System Shock 2). System Shock 2 is a far superior game to Dead Space though in terms of both gameplay and story (I feel awful even using them in the same sentence). Dead Space takes about 12-15 hours to complete. 7/10Please upvote this review if you found it useful :)			"

												One of my top ten games I've ever played.  This game has a compelling story, scary atmosphere, wonderful gameplay, the whole package.  I enjoy a challange, and this game provided on higher difficulties.  Limiting ammo and ways to eliminate threats just makes horror games that much more horrifying.  I never really ran out of ammo, but in my playthrough I always remained fairly low and had to purchase some on occasion and it just made me really focus on how I killed things and added a level of a depth to the gameplay.I played it on x-box, if it shows  <1 hour or something10/10			"

												11 hours to play through the story on medium difficulty.Dead Space has a decent story & good atmosphere though it is more action than horror. About a third of the way in you become too powerful, save for a regenerating enemy, which reduces the tension further so it might be better to start on a harder difficulty. Controls are a bit awkward & the bosses are a little underwelming , still worth a playthrough.Also there's stomping zombie babies.			"

I've played it about 8-10 hours and I'm ready to play Dead Space 2, which looks a lot better.I haven't run into any bugs. The music, sound and voice acting are great, and at least, I think the graphics were cutting edge when the game came out.Clearly, this game was made by talented sadists.

												Great game to play if you love survival horror games. If you haven't played the sequels or watched the movies, play this for a couple hours and you'll see just how dark this game's can become. There's also plenty of collectibles to find. Some are video or audio logs, however most of it is text logs. Now while that may be a huge turnoff for some, you don't need those logs to know what's happening. The logs are there to provide some more details on what's happening as well as giving some background information. The combat system in this game is pretty unique, too. The Necromorphs which are like space zombies need to be killed by severing their limbs. Shooting them in the head however won't work Anyway it's been awhile since I played it on my Xbox One and I've forgotten how the story goes at some parts, but what I can tell you is that this game is worth the buy. Especially if you're reading this during the winter 2016 sale. $5 for a 2008 AAA title. Pretty damn good price. Same for DS2 (also on sale). 3 on the other hand isn't great.			"

												I enjoyed this game. It is scary... if dead bodies scare you. I mean, ..sure there are moments where I jumped a bit, but..scary is ..giving it too much credit. Perhaps how I played (as a paranoid person I shot all bodies, removed all corpses from rooms before fully entering them, had plenty of ammo at all times with all weapons, kept aware of all surroundings and exits, etc) maybe I killed the scary..but ...whatever. Its good. Good gameplay, good story, good characters, great environments. Even good puzzles / level design.What's wrong is that... its not scary, its just incredibly gore intensive. Its piles of flesh and blood here, constant disgusting dismemberment of reanimated alien dead things..and ...I was grossed out. Half the time I was supposed to be scared of something I was more worried how gross it was going to be to kill it. The game has some great moments though that are worth the money to experience. A good buy.			"

												This game is badass. Believeable sci-fi setting combined with great character performances, intriguing story, inescapable atmosphere, solid gameplay, and some of the best sound design I've ever seen.The enemies also make really good use of using body horror as a mental attack on you.Man this game is gewd. Only fault is probably making your character a bit too much of a badass, and the weapons a little too effective, making the latter half of the game a real breeze once you got some decent upgrades and cash behind you.

												Once you fix the mouse responsiveness issues (max sensitivity, remap, and disable vsync) the game is incredible on the PC.I wouldn't say it is the most terrifying game out, but it definitely had its moments and the atmosphere is superb. The story is slightly easy to guess (atleast it was for me) but that didnt prevent me from finishing it (may play it again soon too! :P).Yes, DeadSpace 1 (and 2!) support Eyefinity with +hoz. Infact I'd argue that the Deadspace series is my favorite eyefinity experience, I really enjoyed it THAT much.			"

												So much atmosphere, such great pacing in both the action and the story. Managing your inventory and scavenging for supplies and power nodes to upgrade your gear is actually fun and not a pain in the ♥♥♥. Also, this game will scare the crap out of you.Better than just scaring you, the developers actually understand pacing and relying on atmosphere to frighten you, rather than resorting to jump scare after jump scare. What that means is that you can play the game for long periods of time without having to put it down because you are simply drained or have too much adrenaline in your system to keep going. The developers did a good job of threading the needle.			"

												Horror probably isn't the right word here. The game doesn't really go for good scares, mostly just sudden ""oh my god it's an alien coming straight for you suddenly have a loud noise"" and they just got incredibly predictable after a while. But it can be quite creepy at times - probably helped absolutely humonguous amounts by the absolutely incredible sound design of this game. I think that this might the only time I max out one of the score categories for a game.Seriously, the sound design is just amazing. Incredible ambient noise, with really creepy nuances and fantastic utterly disgusting music for when you get under attack. Every single sound made is absolutely perfect.Also the UI of this game is just amazing. Everything makes sense in the game world, it's all projected out of your suit or from screens on everything. It's fantastic, and it helps increase the tension because you can't pause the game by opening the map screen/inventory screen.The gameplay is pretty good, though I didn't feel it got tough enough on Normal difficulty so perhaps Hard difficulty is the right difficulty to play it on. The weapons are all satisfying to use, and can be very effective when upgraded correctly. I liked the way most of the enemies had weak points you could exploit to kill them quicker and conserve more ammo. The design of the aliens was fantastic, and the ship design was quite good (I liked how you had to revisit some levels for good reason, and some things had changed and that actually made it slightly creepy and foreboding).The story wasn't particularly impressive, but a few bits of it were quite good. I was quite disappointed by the very end of the game though, like literally the last few seconds [if you've played it you'll know what I mean] because it just felt incredibly cheap.Other than that, this game was very good. A definite play, if not for the perfectly adequate gameplay then just for the mindblowingly incredible sound. Seriously, someone give the guy who did all that all the awards. Ever. All the awards.

												1st thing is first: DEAD SPACE IS NOT SCARY!!This has absolutly NOTHING frightening in it, there is no TRUE horror & irrational thinking brought on by the unknown;there are just Jumpshocks after jumpshock after jumpshock after jumpshock after JUMPSHOCKS!!(It's ripping off D00M 3, except your not scared when the monster jump out at you, you're SHOCKed)HOWEVER....Just because this ""survival horror"" game is not scary DOES NOT mean it is a bad game.In fact, it's quite a cool game, with some new mechanics.Like how there is no HUD for the game: everything is shown on Issac's RIG suit, & the occasional screen displayed around his armour.And how the Fact that there is only one WEAPON (Security Pulse Rifle (Aliens rip-off) & all the other weapons are engineering tools.And I DO have to mention the creative ways to kill enemies: The Necromorphs (Aliens ripp-off again) can't be killed by conventional headshots: you have to use your mining tools to cut off their limbs as they do the most damage & inhibit their attacks/movment, which IS admittedly creative. Although, I don't think they're doing anything creative with some enemies having the obvious Lost Planet ""Shoot the glowing orange point for more damage"" parts on monstersAnd the story IS kind of bogus: It isn't THAT original, & all the stuff you think is going to happen happens, they DID get the style (if it DOES exsist) right, as it's ""Generic but everyboy copies it's generic""They DO have some good back story, although you'll need to play the 2nd, worser Dead Space 2 to see it done PROPERLYAlso, is it just me, or does the USG Ishimora (<-bad spelling) look like it was BUILT to look like it's an unpleasent place that has gone to hell even BEFORE the monsters arrive?Because if ALL the elevators were built out of cages & chains to begin with, then it's almost like they're EXPECTING to be attacked..........but that's just me nitpicking.At the end of the day, it is widely agreed that out of the Dead Space series, this one is the best.And I would recommend you get it, but at half-price.It's enjoyable.... but it's not ""the master of sci-fi horror"" that idiots might tell you it is.3/5			"

												A nice horror 3rd person shooter action game that is Resident Evil + Silent Hill, in space.Similar to Resident Evil and Silent Hill, you play in 3rd person mode killing aliens with your various guns while scavenging for loot. Unlike the previous 2 games, you can actually buy items such as ammo from stores which are located throughout the game. You can also strategically shoot off body parts of aliens to damage them more, allowing you to conserve ammo.The graphics and sounds are good. The story is decent enough, though story was never a forte in this game genre.The con is that there are too many moments where aliens suddenly appear in your face, scaring you through sudden shock. So if you have a heart condition, do not get this game. But if you don't, consider getting this game while it is cheap.			"

												While catagorized as horror its scares rely on keeping you on edge with both jump scares and health-kit/ammo shortages. The controls are a bit stiff and there is an intentianal delay in some actions, but rather than being broken it instead makes you feel immersed. You are an engineer in the game, not the doom guy. You aren't trained for combat and you weren't expecting any of this to happen. Your weapons are your literal working tools and you're just trying to get the hell out of dodge alive. There are certain points in the game were you can die in a scripted sequence very easily and the mini cutscene can drag on forever, especially for the final boss. 7/10 no replay value really.			"

Running Dead Space on an AMD GPU 
A Guide for Dead Space
By: Hootie

			 Framerate slowdown? Mouse acceleration and sensitivity issues? The invisible door bug?  The port for Dead Space 1 isn't perfect, and nigh unplayable on some machines.		


 Follow those instructions specifically as it says AND, then after that restart your computer. Trust me, it doesn't kick in until you restart your PCStep 2: Also Click on this link, again, it's another Steam Guide but this one helps to fix the terribly low and awful mouse controls that the game has on default, trust me, its a very serious issue - 


How to fix mouse control problems 
A Guide for Dead Space
By: Bropalm

			Here's how you can fix all problems with the mouse controls by editing the game's config file.		


Step 3: There's no step 3 because that number is not in the Steam text unicode of this user review client...jk moving on, MAKE SURE TO TURN OFF V-SYNCStep 4: *SPOILERS BUT I NEED TO TELL YOU* So there's a part in the very beginning of the game where you are going to come across what is infamously known as the ""Invisible-Wall-Bug-Of-The-Dead-Space-PC-Port"". This invisible wall bug is found right in the beginning of the game in the first chapter where you first recieve the plasma cutter right after you exit the elevator unarmed from the slasher necromorphs chasing you. This room has a wall that says ""cut off the limbs"" and has a guy screaming behind a door, if you were to continue your journey that exact door that dude is behind will not let you pass, seriously, it's a stupid glitch but theres many stupid glitches in this game that shouldn't be in there. So this is what you are going to do, I recommend you save your game before hand in the first save station to do this. Once you reach the first elevator and you are in it quickly go to your options menu and turn on V-Sync, you may have to deal with terrible framerate and mouse controls but once you make it pass that door you can turn it off and continue your survival through the USG Ishimura. (If this doesn't work then try to find a way to decrease your framerate under 30 fps, the game is capped at 30 anyway, I heard Fraps helps with this under the same process I specified).Soooo yeah, now that that's out of the way, lets get on to the review shall we?ReviewSo excluding the atrocious PC port Dead Space is a fantastic and immersive horror experience. Now I got to be frank with you, I pretty much spoiled Dead Space when I saw a let's play from like 3-5 years ago yet my memory was very vague when I played this game. To tell you what's going on in the story I recommend you play it for yourself because duh spoilers, that plus other people who give reviews will tell tend to explain the story, mine is more of the experience.Besides spoiling the game for myself I have also played Dead Space 2 and completed it (On the Xbox 360) and have got to say that the experience was very unique compared to if I played Dead Space 1 first and then 2. You know that feeling when you look at a picture of a famous monument and actually went there? Or go and experience that one place that's so talked about and then actually visit it? Well that's what Dead Space 1 was like when I played it, so much of the trilogy's plot all revolves around the events of what happened on the USG Ishimura and the planet Aegis 7 along with the developement of the main protagonist Isaac Clarke, that plus the event's of the USG Ishimura acts as a catalyst for pretty much the entire 3 game's story.As a survival horror game Dead Space does it pretty well even though the gameplay mechanics are straight up Resident Evil 4 just with new stuff that you can do. Now yes as much of the Dead Space community has stated Dead Space 1 is a lot more scarier than is Dead Space 2 for many reasons. Now I'm pretty tough when it comes to scary games yet Dead Space still tends to frighten me compared to the jump scare infested and cinematic sequel that was Dead Space 2. The game kept my heart at an above than normal pulse in certain parts and some parts have truly made my heart race.The Immersion in Dead Space is incredible with the sound design being spot on along with the game's mechanics and setting working together to make the immersive experience amazing, here's how it works: Dead Space's indicators is all attached to the character's body such as the character's ""RIG"" stating the player's health along with the Stasis meter being on the character's RIG aswell, The game's mechanics such as the Stasis ability and Kinesis ability are all integrated uses in the game's setting, story, and lore, not some thing tacked on for just gameplay purposes. For example the use of stasis and kinesis are actual tools used by the USG Ishimura's crew along with the weapons of the game being mechanical power tools used on the ship (excluding the Pulse Rifle of course). The sound design is spot on and it all makes sense and adds to the game, you will hear distant screams of unlucky survivors and necromophs alike that will make you wonder if there were any other survivors still on the ship through out your journey, you will hear clanks and sounds in the vents and in the distance that make you tense thinking that a necromorph can come out of any vent at any time possible.Dead Space's story is very interesting and many of the concept's of the game are ones that I have never seen in anything before, sure the game take's influences from franchises such as Alien along with how the premise of the game has already been done by titles such as System Shock 2. Besides that I think the game is very original for its time and I think anyone should do some research on the lore because the setting of Dead Space with planet cracking, the Marker, necromorphs and the Church of Unitology is one that I find interesting.The Bad n' UgryThe port for Dead Space on PC is atrocious, not for the fact that it has issues but by the fact that it's bugs are absolutely pathetic, like really, some of the bugs in this game make Call of Duty: Ghost's PC port look good, I mean here's a list of the bugs that I've encountered:1. The game doesn't even try to run on AMD alone 2. Stupid invisible door glitch in the beginning3. Broken physics and highly sensitive hitboxs for non-static objects that cause things such as corpes and dead body parts to flail around when you give a slight love tap to them (chapter 2 body bag dance party lel)4. Player model/Isaac Clarke tends to spaz out when you sprint on some parts of the ground5. Finicky mouse controls with horribly low sensitivity even on the highest setting6. Some wierd thing that happens to a tram door that gets stuck mid animation that causes you from passing7. Characters that die tend to spaz out when they go from static character to ragdoll (hilarious and somewhat immersive breaking)8. (MY ABSOLUTE HATED) So there will be parts where you will have to float in space and there is a slight chance that your character make freeze via clipping into geometry and just die as if Isaac sufficated from I don't know, polygons? This happened to me like 3 times and 2 were by the end of the gameBut hey that doesn't mean it's a bad game! So go out and buy it and have a good ol' time!			"

												A true masterpiece. This game is a literally terrific combination of despairing emptiness, gory shootouts, and frigthening silence. It won't make itself impossible to play as Amnesia would, yet it will make you clinge to your chair and try to remember what on Earth made you start playing on the first place.Some people had problems with the camera and mouse, but I haven't seen any of that. Even more, I love how the game is controlled, similarly to Mass Effect.The lore is amazing, it will drag you and cry for more when it ends. Luckily there is more, by now. The art concept is sort of a crossover between ""zombie apocalypse"", ""steampunk"" and ""space conquest"", which I love to no end.You just can't go wrong buying this game.			"

												Probably my FAVE fps series of all time... or a pretty damn close tie. Dead Space is a BEAUTIFULLY made Horror FPS like no other. The series is packed full of gore, excitement, thrills and twists that will leave you to find yourself letting that pizza you just ordered get cold as you lean closer and closer towards your screen getting sucked into the nightmare that is Dead Space.The game takes place where the Animation Movie leaves off, and it has a wonderfully executed story line that will grasp your attention and interest. The cutscene are awesome and the death scene are even more spectacular. If you happen to play this game it is at least worth dying once and sometimes twice to every enemy type as the cinematic death cutscenes definitely go unrivalled. The game is also inredibly fun playing it multiple ways. My personal favorite is to beat it on hardest difficulty with only the starting plasma cutter. I have completed 1,2 on hardest that way and 51.4% through 3 on impossible which is ludacris and might very well be close to impossible if not impossible. Either way, AMAZING SERIESS11/10 MUST BUY			"

												A hugely intense game marred by a bad case of consolitis. Dead Space spawned a whole host of imitators, and for good reason -- it's well-made and placed in a setting original enough to make it stand out from most third-person shooters. Great atmosphere, exceptional surround sound, and ingenious weapon design combine to make a game worth playing through to the end.Unfortunately, Dead Space suffers from some of the worst console-to-PC translation I've ever experienced. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gamepad controls make movement and aiming more painful than they need to be, and there's a hardware conflict that can cause the gamepad to do nothing but spin the camera in a 360° pattern (something that the devs never bothered to fix through the entirety of the series, amazingly enough). The unchageable FOV prevents me from playing for more than a couple hours due to motion sickness. There's also a bug that causes stuttering when vsync is enabled.The positives definitely override the negatives though, and Dead Space is a game that should be experienced by horror aficionados and shooter fans alike.

												For those looking for a game from one of the BEST years in gaming, look no further. Dead Space pits you in place where both fear and paranoia may become your best allies. Dead Space is the first of three games in the main series with two spin-off games, several novels, and a few animated movies. The story pits you in the midst of a communications blackout on a massive mining ship and  you're an engineer stuck inside the infested ship that hordes a morbid secret. You and the other survivors of a ship responing to a distress signal must now find a way of the mining ship before being consumed by the nightmares that reside within.This is no ordinary jumpscare thrills shooter as the encounters with the enemies in combat can be just as terrifying as the jumpscares placed by the devs. This game will test your will and the harder the difficulty the more you will gasp for air.

												I never write reviews.But this game deserves one. Out of all the games in the Dead Space series, this one, in my opinion, is the scariest BY FAR.I do not find any other setting for a horror game more suitable than a derelict space craft drifting in space, knowing that YOU have no allies!10/10 would crap my pants again like I did in 2008.

												The game itself is fantastic. Great graphics, atmosphere, and gameplay. However, it has some annoying ""console port' issues. There's two showstopping bugs. One happens in the first 5 minutes of the game, the other in the last 5. First bug is a door that has an invisible wall inside of it and won't let you go through. The 2nd bug is a crash to desktop when opening a door. Both can be bypassed by temporarily turning on v-synch. You'll want to keep the in-game v-synch off most of the time because otherwise you get locked to 30 FPS..I also recommend capping the game at 60 FPS using something like dxtory, otherwise there's some weird physics bugs. They don't impact the gameplay, but I saw a bunch of corpses that should have been stationary wildly twirling in the air. It was as comical as it sounds. All these bugs are realted to the fact that in the late 2000s developers had this habit of tying various scripting and physics math to the in-game FPS.  I assume this was done because the console version was locked to a certain, and consistent FPS. However when you're getting above 60 FPS on a PC, things start to wig out. If you notice anything weird happening, that's likely why. I also had an issue where I would instantly die while doing some of the zero-g sections. It would happen when flying between surfaces. Sometimes when landing on a surface at an awkward angle, my game would freeze for a moment and then play a death animation. Not sure if that last one is an issue with the game itself, or due to the some of the fixes I was using to improve other parts of the experience.Highly reccomend the game as it is worth playing. There aren't really any other huge issues with the port, but I thought the two issues I described were big enough to warrant mention and criticism. Check out: http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Dead_Space for some additional tweaks and fixes. I found the FOV adjust and the ""mouse fix"" pretty handy.			"

												One of my favorite games, incredibly atmospheric and fun to play several times. Much more a survival-horror game than its sequels, especially at the higher difficulty levels. I love the design and storyline of this game as well (much more than the sequels)On that note, the sequels basically ignore the story of this game entirely, the story of this game had a lot of potential and was certainly more interesting than what it would become later. I think as an individual game this particular entry in the series speaks for the story better than the other two.Overall, Its a great game.			"

												Dead frustratingOkay, let’s get the bad out of the way first. The controls for the PC version of this otherwise good game are the worst I have ever encountered. I won’t go into detail but they’re so awkward they almost spoiled the game for me. Almost. (There are also some truly annoying problems with camera and viewpoint angles, but don’t get me started on that!) But what about the good? DEAD SPACE succeeds, despite the aforementioned problems, mainly because it oozes atmosphere. This is a very claustrophobic game that sucks you in and really does induce anxiety. You will jump many times, trust me. The story is okay, within the usual limitations of such games, the voice acting is uniformly convincing, and the graphics are good but not outstanding. Where this game excels is in the way it draws you in; immerses you in it’s dark atmosphere. This is a game that makes your palms sweat, which is exactly what it’s supposed to do.3.5/5			"

			 Framerate slowdown? Mouse acceleration and sensitivity issues? The invisible door bug?  The port for Dead Space 1 isn't perfect, and nigh unplayable on some machines.		


 Follow those instructions specifically as it says AND, then after that restart your computer. Trust me, it doesn't kick in until you restart your PCStep 2: Also Click on this link, again, it's another Steam Guide but this one helps to fix the terribly low and awful mouse controls that the game has on default, trust me, its a very serious issue - 


How to fix mouse control problems 
A Guide for Dead Space
By: Bropalm

			Here's how you can fix all problems with the mouse controls by editing the game's config file.		


Step 3: There's no step 3 because that number is not in the Steam text unicode of this user review client...jk moving on, MAKE SURE TO TURN OFF V-SYNCStep 4: *SPOILERS BUT I NEED TO TELL YOU* So there's a part in the very beginning of the game where you are going to come across what is infamously known as the ""Invisible-Wall-Bug-Of-The-Dead-Space-PC-Port"". This invisible wall bug is found right in the beginning of the game in the first chapter where you first recieve the plasma cutter right after you exit the elevator unarmed from the slasher necromorphs chasing you. This room has a wall that says ""cut off the limbs"" and has a guy screaming behind a door, if you were to continue your journey that exact door that dude is behind will not let you pass, seriously, it's a stupid glitch but theres many stupid glitches in this game that shouldn't be in there. So this is what you are going to do, I recommend you save your game before hand in the first save station to do this. Once you reach the first elevator and you are in it quickly go to your options menu and turn on V-Sync, you may have to deal with terrible framerate and mouse controls but once you make it pass that door you can turn it off and continue your survival through the USG Ishimura. (If this doesn't work then try to find a way to decrease your framerate under 30 fps, the game is capped at 30 anyway, I heard Fraps helps with this under the same process I specified).Soooo yeah, now that that's out of the way, lets get on to the review shall we?ReviewSo excluding the atrocious PC port Dead Space is a fantastic and immersive horror experience. Now I got to be frank with you, I pretty much spoiled Dead Space when I saw a let's play from like 3-5 years ago yet my memory was very vague when I played this game. To tell you what's going on in the story I recommend you play it for yourself because duh spoilers, that plus other people who give reviews will tell tend to explain the story, mine is more of the experience.Besides spoiling the game for myself I have also played Dead Space 2 and completed it (On the Xbox 360) and have got to say that the experience was very unique compared to if I played Dead Space 1 first and then 2. You know that feeling when you look at a picture of a famous monument and actually went there? Or go and experience that one place that's so talked about and then actually visit it? Well that's what Dead Space 1 was like when I played it, so much of the trilogy's plot all revolves around the events of what happened on the USG Ishimura and the planet Aegis 7 along with the developement of the main protagonist Isaac Clarke, that plus the event's of the USG Ishimura acts as a catalyst for pretty much the entire 3 game's story.As a survival horror game Dead Space does it pretty well even though the gameplay mechanics are straight up Resident Evil 4 just with new stuff that you can do. Now yes as much of the Dead Space community has stated Dead Space 1 is a lot more scarier than is Dead Space 2 for many reasons. Now I'm pretty tough when it comes to scary games yet Dead Space still tends to frighten me compared to the jump scare infested and cinematic sequel that was Dead Space 2.

 ""Make us whole, Isaac. Make us whole."" TL;DR: Play as Isaac Clarke, the unluckiest son of a ♥♥♥♥♥(literally) engineer in video gaming history ever. Be haunted by a mysterious artefact that is somehow the key to stopping aliens(but still wants to kill you because plot holes).Dead Space is supposedly a survival horror TPS game. While I personally don't think this game as a good horror game, it at least attempts(and sometimes succeeds), which is much more better then Dead Space 3(that game didn't even try).This is what the game is about: you are part of a repair team, heading towards the USG Ishmura, the biggest 'Planet Cracker' in the universe. It sent out a distress call and lost connection, so you, as the engineer(you're accompanied by Kendra, a hacker, and Zach Hammond, a security officer, and his team), is to fix up Ishmura(and your ship as well, the USG Kelion) and find the source of the call. Of course, everything goes south when in the first 30 minutes, you become haunted by the 'Necromorphs', mysterious, grotesque and dangerous humanoid creatures that quickly panics the entire team. Now, since you're the only one able to do anything(because game protagonist logic), you have to find out what the ♥♥♥♥ happened here.The game is kinda like what everyone calls it: Resident Evil in space. After all, the developers based the gameplay off of Resident Evil because they didn't have much time for development. Though there are very unique gameplay features in Dead Space.The game doesn't have a HUD(Heads Up Display). Your health is represented by your RIG, the Resource Integration Gear. Everyone has one of these in the future- it a computer device(looks like a mechanical spine) that you attach on your back. Since this is a TPS, you can see your RIG most of the time, and as your health goes down, the bar on your RIG gets low(like how health bars get low), and it changes color to blue to yellow to red.This game also has a inventory and a store system, so you press tab to see your inventory. When you press tab, your suit(you wear a engineering/or a mining suit that makes you look like a  badass [images1.wikia.nocookie.net]) will display a hologram inventory screen in front of you. It fits in with the SF feel of the game, and is much more immersive then a generic HUD. Your ammo will also be displayed when you aim, much like Halo, though your number of clips is not displayed, so you have to check your inventory.You will find money inside crates and corpses of Necromorphs, which can be used at the store to buy ammo, health packs, etc. You will also find schematics for new items so you can just install it at the store and buy it. New suit schematic are important as they increase your armor and inventory size. You will also find 'Power Nodes' to open 'Node Rooms', which has very good things like much needed ammo on higher difficulties, and most important of all, new schematics(there are only one schematic for one item, so if you miss that schematic, it's gone for good).You can also go to the Bench and upgrade your RIG(armor, health, air, etc), weapons, your Stasis Module which slows down enemies and objects, and your Kinesis Module which picks up heavy objects without a use of ammo- very important in higher difficulties. You upgrade them with Power Nodes, so be careful- you never know if you'll find a Node Room right after you spend all of your Nodes on upgrades.There are also good variety of weapons, though the first free weapon you get, the Plasma Cutter, is very versatile and is good at everything(it's basically the best weapon in the game. you never want to sell it) As you can see from the name, it cuts things. It's a tool for cutting rocks, but in this game, it's used to cut off limbs. Why? Because headshots or bodyshots doesn't work for these monsters. You have to make them useless by cutting off their limbs. They don't die just from headshots(though they do lose their vision), and their torso is made out of ♥♥♥♥ing metal or something.So we know the gameplay is at least something, so move on to the story- it actually has a very deep world(that you get to know more about in the second game), and the story intrigues you right from the start. The atmosphere and the story in general is heavily inspired by a 1997 movie 'Event Horizon'. The box cover for the game(a hand floating in space) is a homage to a scene in the movie, actually.(the more you know) It has that general feel of 'what the ♥♥♥♥ happened here' like in Half-Life or Bioshock(this game probably did the best job on that), and finding out the mystery by checking out all of the text logs is pretty fun. The dispute between Kendra and Zach(Kendra says 'let's get the ♥♥♥♥ out of here', while Zach says 'We still have a mission') also seemed to be pretty good, though it stops right after Kendra disappears, then she comes back then Zach disappears.Oh, and Isaac- you just gotta ♥♥♥♥ing feel for him. He doesn't talk(he does in the later games), but he just does all of these things, and everytime he screams of fear(his 'AHHHHRG!!' is very memorable in some death scenes), you can't but say ""dude... this is ♥♥♥♥ed up."". And oh yeah, the death scenes in this game is notorious for being grotesque(much like the rest of the game), and it's true. It's the only thing all of the fans have praised throughout the series(the later games adds even more).Let's take a look at some of the other miscellaneous things though- the graphics are not dated. It's good enough, and the gore is like I said, great(though I don't know if it's a good thing or not). The soundtrack is very similar to Half-Life's case. It's mostly ambient tracks, which makes the atmosphere a lot better, but lot less memorable.So we narrowed down Dead Space, and is it a good game? Yes, it is. It's a great game in fact- and you can tell from all of what I said earlier. Though it still has its cons.The controls. The game's notorious for having terrible mouse controls, while it gets better in the later games, and gets better in this game as well if you tweak some of the files, the fact that they haven't released a official patch on Steam makes me feel pain inside. The difficulty is also a problem. If you get used to it(and you will), it's really really easy. If you watch  Jesse Cox's   blind Dead Space playthough , he plays it on Medium and does not die a single time(and he's known to suck at bideo gems). The boss fights are especially bad- you just shoot at the yellow balls and poof, you win. Every. ♥♥♥♥ing. Boss.Also, the 'survival horror' part is very subjective- the game does a good job of jumpscares in fact. They pop out of the vents and sometimes sneaks up on you, etc. They even play dead sometimes. But all of the monster spawns are scripted, so if you know where they'll spawn(or if you played 70 ♥♥♥♥ing hours like me), it's not that scary at all anymore. The atmosphere still might still spook you, though many people have said that they are not even scared of that anymore. Dead Space 2 and 3 leaves the whole 'closed down environment' atmosphere behind(well, maybe not Dead Space 3), but Dead Space 2 has other things to scare you(spoilers!).Except for that, there isn't much to say. I give Dead Space a 8/10, it's a great game. The execution is near perfect, though the minor gameplay issues and the bugs ruins it a bit. The storyline is still great though, and since it is even more expanded in the later games, I highly recommend you to buy Dead Space 2 and 3 as well. In my opinion(that I will explain in the Dead Space 2 review), Dead Space 2 is gamelay-wise better, and while Dead Space 3 was a huge disappointment, it's still a good game and you should try it out.

												Dead Space: Succeeds where many other survival horror games fail. This game is brutal, bloody, and as hard as asteroid debris. Pros: + Gore. You get a sense of dread in your stomach watching severed body segments float in zero gravity.+ Challenging. You will die several times. Several times. You really have to want to beat this game to get to the end.+ Long. It took me more than 17 hours to get through this game on medium, and that's pretty impressive for a game of this type.+ Stage design is immaculate. Your objectives in each section are varied, tie in nicely with the story, and the game looks great on a nice rig.+ The “Ripper” weapon is pure, unbridled joy. Cons:- The load screen makes you wait. If you try to minimize the screen and go do something else, it will still make you wait when you pull it back up. At least a third of the time you play this game you will be staring at the load screen. Ah, so this is how they meant to artificially extend playtime.- Frustrating controls and camera angles. Why must I watch from his shoulder like a parrot? Oh, you didn't mean to hit that button? Sucks to be you. Hope you like staring at load screens.- The protagonist is mute. When he gets ripped to shreds by Necromorphs, it's gross, but I feel no sense of connection to the hero.- The asteroid-shooting mini-game is pure tedium. Pro/Cons:+/- The upgrade system is appreciated, but the changes you make to your gear don't always seem that significant. +/- There is no cooperative mode, but then being the only person accomplishing tasks ramps up the tension. +/- Objectives can be vague and will make you consult online guides, but then, this game doesn't always hold your hand. The stages aren't as linear as they are in the 2nd and 3rd installments, where you're carted along one path like a theme park ride. Summary: This game is more than just Resident Evil in space. “Dead Space” does survival horror better. There is just a perfect amount of ammunition and supplies to keep you on the edge of your seat, amazing sequences, machines, and scenery, and it doesn't blatantly coddle the player. It qualifies as a classic. Who should buy this game:*Mature gamers that want a real survival horror challenge. *Horror aficionados who feel that most games aren't gory enough. Who should avoid this game:*Gamers who want something to play with friends.*Squeamish people that are upset by monstrous sounds, blood, and dead bodies. I give it an 8.9 out of 10.			"

												Awesome game. I wasn't really sure what to think of it when I bought it shortly after it came out. This series has become one of my all time video game favorites, and I have been playing video games for almost 25 years now.Tips to enjoy:1.) Turn out lights.2.) Play at night.3.) Be the only one home and expose your back to a large dark room.4.) Get headphones with surround sound5.) Enjoy peeing in your pants and jumping at shadows.Seriously, this game is morbid, dark, twisted, and tons of fun. I keep going back for more.The game may be old (2008ish), but is still lots of fun. Everything is done in 3rd person. This mean all interfaces, inventory screen, video/audio/text logs, maps, etc are shown in 3rd person at anytime where you can be attacked from mosters. The controls may seem unresponsive at first but it quickly adds to the game machanics and atmosphere and don't really become a burden. The lighting and sound design is spot on. That is where this game really, really shines. This game may not have the greatest graphics, but you couldn't ask for better lighting placement or sound effects. The game does mix things up and it never overuses a game concept which does add for atleast a second playthrough. Each enviroment feels different yet somehow familiar but you never get that feeling of ""been there, done that.""  The dismemberment mechanic (where the best way to kill something is to shoot its limbs off), the 3rd person everything, the lighting and sound design, the level design, the ""Zero G' and vacuum machanic, the pacing of the game, and the general atmosphere of the game makes it unique and one not to be missed. This is one that you will remember for several years and probably pick up to play after a couple years and still find it fun.This game is NOT to be missed.			"

												The game itself is fantastic. Great graphics, atmosphere, and gameplay. However, it has some annoying ""console port' issues. There's two showstopping bugs. One happens in the first 5 minutes of the game, the other in the last 5. First bug is a door that has an invisible wall inside of it and won't let you go through. The 2nd bug is a crash to desktop when opening a door. Both can be bypassed by temporarily turning on v-synch. You'll want to keep the in-game v-synch off most of the time because otherwise you get locked to 30 FPS..I also recommend capping the game at 60 FPS using something like dxtory, otherwise there's some weird physics bugs. They don't impact the gameplay, but I saw a bunch of corpses that should have been stationary wildly twirling in the air. It was as comical as it sounds. All these bugs are realted to the fact that in the late 2000s developers had this habit of tying various scripting and physics math to the in-game FPS.  I assume this was done because the console version was locked to a certain, and consistent FPS. However when you're getting above 60 FPS on a PC, things start to wig out. If you notice anything weird happening, that's likely why. I also had an issue where I would instantly die while doing some of the zero-g sections. It would happen when flying between surfaces. Sometimes when landing on a surface at an awkward angle, my game would freeze for a moment and then play a death animation. Not sure if that last one is an issue with the game itself, or due to the some of the fixes I was using to improve other parts of the experience.Highly reccomend the game as it is worth playing. There aren't really any other huge issues with the port, but I thought the two issues I described were big enough to warrant mention and criticism. Check out: http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Dead_Space for some additional tweaks and fixes. I found the FOV adjust and the ""mouse fix"" pretty handy.			"

												A good sci-fi, horror. Set on a space ship that is infested with aliens. Variety is one of the reasons I enjoyed this game so much. You have a very nice array of weapons in this game with two firing modes for each and many different alien types to kill. The gameplay was fun although slightly clumbsy at times. It had cool zero-gravity areas where you can jump/fly from floor to ceiling and walls in sometimes large areas in the spaceship. The backgrounds and and enviroments were very realistic and added to the overall atmosphere of the game. The story to be honest wasn't very immersive or gripping I felt but then again not many games draw me in story-wise. I loved the upgrade system on the guns/rig and it gave me an excuse/reason to go exploring for power nodes (you use them to upgrade). Although variety in regards to weapons and enemies were enough to keep me enjoying this. I did find some areas/puzzles to be slightly repetitive as it seemed as though I was doing mundane tasks at times but nothing too majorly boring. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys, horror, sci-fi, aliens, space and shooter games. 7/10			"

												This was probably almost a metroidvania during development, there's a lot of little things like the pointless mapscreen and often being able to tackle several objectives in any order (everybody just follows the breadcrumbs anyways) that point towards it. But even though that was a bust there's still lots to like here. the basic gameplay is very RE4 inspired but there's a lot to set it apart in the enemy design, and i think it puts an acceptable twist on the gun economy/inventory system compared to that game too. Cool gameplays, cool graphics, cool as hell setting, alright story. One of the few truly good 7th gen games, 9/10			"

												Buying the Humble Origin Bundle with the knowledge that 2/3rds of the Dead Space series was included, my feelings were probably akin to a royal food tester's: I love the banquet, but the thought of that one deadly dish is absolutely terrifying. I've played my share of Survival Horror (starting with the granddaddy of them all, Alone in the Dark), but there's just something about Dead Space that's truly terrifying - the same reason Amnesia still sits on my digital shelf collecting digital cobwebs.But then the backlog starts piling, and a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. I finished Dead Space, and that should count as something when I get to Purgatory. The worry of absolute terror never ended - that's really something considering the game clocks in about 12 hours; and most survival horror/action games usually lose the terror after a few hours of collecting heavy weaponry. I was hooked with the atmoshpere and story that borrows a lot from scifi horror greats, but somehow puts its own stamp of uniqueness on what it steals.Speaking of uniqueness, there's a lot of it in Dead Space. The gameplay twist that enemies go down easier by shooting off their limbs instead of the head sounds wonky in the beginning, but a few encounters with the necromorphs made me a believer. It's perfect because arms and legs tend to move more erraticly than one's head, which adds to the tension when aiming. Also, as a result, probably the most unique weapons I've handled in a game were created for this Dead Space. The cutter, the linegun, the ripper, all have their special use when it comes to dismemberment, with just the right amount of frustration to give them character - give them a sense that these are real tools.Another thing to note is the game's inventory system. Very much like Resident Evil's limited slot-based  inventory, complete with external storage nodes that transfer excess baggage from one spot to another, Dead Space ups the ante by adding money to the mix. This actually made inventory management fun instead of frustrating, as I was figuring out how much of which ammo I should have, I should sell in exchange for Power Nodes (basically upgrade points). It became a mini game in itself. I'd be sad to hear if this lead to the adoption of microtransactions in Dead Space 3, but for this humble begging, it's very much welcome. (It also helps that plot items have their own inventory space, so need to worry about not having a crucial item when you need it).That's Dead Space in a nutshell. A rancid, mutating death nutshell. I'm still getting that same sense of thrill/dread about sampling the next two installments, so maybe I'll give the other gut-friendlier dishes in my buffet a try for the time being.			"

												The first installment in the Dead Space series is set in the year 2508 and begins when a mining starship, the USG Ishimura, sends out a distress signal during a mining operation on the planet Aegis VII. In this game, players step into the role of Isaac Clarke ― a ship systems engineer whose journey starts on a seemingly routine mission to fix the communication systems on the planet cracker.It is not long until he realizes that he stepped into a living nightmare of vicious alien creatures and a dead silence ship where he must constantly fight to get out alive.The story in Dead Space is one of its strongest points. Most of it is told via video, audio and text diaries you find scattered around the ship. Another strong point is the atmosphere, a lot of it due to brilliant sound effects. It's a very impressive looking game overall, though sometimes you will feel like you are going through the same corridors over and over again. The combat is also good. Some sections may look a bit repetitive, however, the strategic dismemberment and the stomping are just extremely fun and satisfying.Being a fan of the survival horror and sci-fi genres, I played this game myself and have watched other people play it, and it simply does not get boring. It does stop being truly scary after the first few hours but jump scares are always around the corner.			"

												I have mixed feeling for this game.Pros1. It's not a regular shooting game where you blast through your enemies and do n0 sc0p3 360. It hits the sweet spot between shooting game and horror game.2. Headshots do jack ♥♥♥♥. You have to cut off their limb to do more damage. Also most weapons are designed to be good at cutting things so it is forgiving to players like me who suck at aiming.3. You get to be a engineer that kills off things and saves the day much like Gordon Freeman(my favorite protagonist).4. The ambience is great. Distant sound of crying makes you scary. Footsteps in the vents makes you ♥♥♥♥ your pants. You can never be confident that you are safe.Cons1. Control is just terrible. Vsync on, latency is too high. Vsync off, you can barely look around with max mouse sensitivity and 3000dpi. You have to turn on vsync in your graphic card's settings. Too small FOV doesn't help either. Movement is also very delayed.2. You can barely do anything. You can't jump, duck. I keep doing stomp attack as I press space bar expecting Isaac to jump. Compared to half life 1 and 2, it feels so stiff. It would be much better if Isaac can at least duck.3. Menus being in the game itself is very creative, but it creats problems on keyboard. You can't use mouse or movement key to navigate menu(it will just make Isaac look around or move), so you have to move one hand to seperate keys. This gets annoying quickly.4. There are not many weapons and some of them are just useless. And more weapons you have, more varied ammo drops are and more inventory clog. I only used cutter and rifle and still had inventory problem.5. Battles get old pretty quickly. Same enemy, same stratagy. Puzzles are boring and too obvious. Game just drags after chapter 5 or 6.I wouldn't recommend this for full price. But it's worth buying when on like -75% sale.			"

												Dead Space is a third person, linear story-drivien, single player horror game. Gameplay focuses on third person shooting with some light puzzel solving.Oh, Dead Space, why did I wait so long to play you? This title has been in my backlog since 2010. I can't believe it took this long for me to play it, but I'm glad I finally did. The graphics hold up and in many cases still look amazing, but the real draw here is the ambiance. EA redwood Shores completely nails the derelict spaceship atmosphere. I'd like to put the sound design on a pedestal here as well. The 5.1 surround sound mix will instill a deep paranoia within you, making your walks through the ship extremely tense. Another stand out here is the HUD, or lack thereof. All the elements of a traditional HUD you would find in another game are here, but they are cleverly presented in a fashion (mostly through holograms) that fits the game world. You're left with a third person perspective that feels incredibly immersive and cinematic. I liked how most of the weapons had a utilitarian use (cutting, mining, torching, etc) that fit within the game world rather than just being military in design. The zero-g sections of the game did a good job of distorting your perspective and in a couple cases gave me that weird feeling in your gut like you're falling. It reminded me of Prey (2006). There's some solid Sci-Fi elements to be found here too.If there's a weak point, it comes from the story. It's not bad, but certainly not great. It doesn't bring anything new to the table and that's not necessarily a bad thing, just a little disappointing. What it does bring though, comes with competence, at least at first. The setup is perfect. You're there to investigate a communications black out. It was intriguing to unravel the mystery of what happened on the USG Ishimura. But near the end of the game, all the typical tropes and cliches of the genre surface and you're left scratching your head as to some character motivations and the would-be twists that you saw coming a mile away. Had the story been less typical and more interesting, I would call this a must play title. But it misses that mark for me. Near the end of the game I grew weary of the tasks and the ""but first you need to do this"" missions. I spent about fifteen hours for my play-through on normal difficulty and around hour ten I seemed to have built up a tolerance for the jump scares. My fear dropped a couple notches down to anxiety, but I'd say that's probably normal for most people and just the nature of repetition.Still, it's easy to forgive any negative points when you're having such a great time. The game lives up to the atmosphere of titles like BioShock and Resident Evil: Remastered. It's one of those games I'll buy the art book for. It's scary and well crafted throughout.TL;DR: Play this game.			"

												So I just finished this game for the very first time...What can I say...It's a decent game, I think the best way to describe it is by saying it's mixture between RE and Doom.The ending was a bit annoying before the last boss but once I reached him I had a blast again.Graphics are pretty impressive considering when it was released.Sound is really good too, play it with a headphone on and you'll feel really claustrophobic.I bought the pack (Dead Space and Dead Space 2) and paid only 18 bucks for it, it almost seems like stealing.Anyway, from 1 to 10 I'd give this game an 8.

												Hi, this is my first review on Steam and I'll keep it short. The main problem you might experience with the game is the bad port and the graphics issue. I have Windows 10 & Nvidia GeForce GTX 960 and it works fine after following the instructions of this short and simple video (it is not my channel, but it really helped me solve the problem quickly and easily):

												This game has such a fantastic atmosphere. Stranded alone on a derelict station, you fight for your life against weird aliens. The game very much reminded me of games like System Shock or Alone in the Dark (the classic one!), with its great sense of loneliness, fear and mysticism. The parts where you walk on the outer shell of the station are especially terrific.			"

												Dead SpaceBeing honest, I would say that Dead Space is like Resident Evil 4 in space with futuristic weapons. The atmosphere throughout the campaign accomplishs what its goal, scare the hell out of you, at least in your first playthrough. More that once I was suspicious about entering a room or walking near a corpse.The graphics are pretty nice, considering its kind of an old game. I have played Dead Space only with the xbox controller, and the mapping, movement and aiming were really good; don't know about keyboard/mouse. The sound quality is amazing, the background music or noises that you hear makes you turn around and check for any foe. Sometimes when you are shooting a necromorph, you hear some odd noises behind you, and then you realize you got another necromorph behind you D:The boss battles were nice, the upgrading system with nodes, and the store had me hook up in having everything upgraded and bought.I've played Dead Space like 6 times, and I do not regret it. It is totally worth your money. Btw, I beg your pardon if I've written something wrong, as english is not my first language.			"

												Dead Space is a 3rd Person, Survival Horror game unlike any other I have previously experienced. In many other horror genres I'd be able to call all the pop-up scares and gruesome mishaps...but not dead space. You can still see some coming, don't get me wrong, but there will be more times in which you just feel like screaming ""NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE"" the entire time something comes flying out to kill you when you are not looking. In Dead Space, you play as the engineer known as Isaac Clarke who boards a deep space mining vessel to try to fix it up. However, just looking at the title, things do not go according to plan, and soon Isaac and his two other companions are having to fight for their lives aboard a vessel of the living dead. These creatures are not your normal run-of-the-mill zombies...they come in a variety of deadly shapes and sizes, all wanting your flesh. Oh, and when I say you and your two companions must fight, I mean YOU (Isaac) must fight; they provide you with objectives to the next area where things that want to kill you in the most gruesome ways imaginable reside. Dead Space is a disturbing, gore-filled game that mainly the mature should purchase and play. It possesses an enthralling and suspenseful story as you must try to put together all the pieces to a nightmare brought to life. I cannot wait to play Dead Space 2 now as a result, and I highly recommend purchasing this game if you are up for a good scare every now and then. I must say that the game probably lacks some replay value (unless you play on the higher difficulty for the challenge). Not because it is a bad game by any means, but because the ""scares"" are never quite as good as your first runthrough of a horror game, especially when enemies have set spawn points and are not randomly placed. That being said, Dead Space constantly introduces new enemies, various weapons, upgrades, and fast-paced life-or-death scenarios throughout the entire gameplay that will keep you wide awake with a twitchy trigger finger. I'd easily give this game a solid 9 out of 10. So pick it up in the steam sales the next time you are up for experiencing something new or would just like a good scare. Oh, and I do hope you enjoy your stay aboard the USG Ishimura if you do: http://youtu.be/WFUNguAX9d8?t=36s :)			"

This review covers some of the features of Visceral Games' original Dead Space title that make its atmosphere effectively tense and creepy.[. . .] The sense that player-character Isaac Clarke is on his own in Dead Space is incredibly pervasive. The design of the ship often puts him in humongous corridors and chambers, and the zero-gravity mechanic in many such areas sees Clarke juxtaposed to the vastness of the distances.

												Great game, picked this up to relive some of the good ol days. Problem is the game is broken on modern machines. In game vsync makes the game unplayable, but turning it off breaks progress relient triggers, makes the environemnt spaz out ect. Literally unplayable trash. Turning vsync on in nvidia control panal did not rectify the problem for me, though its apparently helped others. The fact that EA fixed the origin version of the game but didn't bother to fix the steam version is absolutle garbage. The fact steam is still charging 20 aussie bucks for this is godamn criminal.

												I am reviewing it not on the game, but for the bad port on PC. don't get it the controls are horrible and and need to play it on a controller, you have to turn off v-sync for good frames, and if you have a decent computer you can run into a game-breaking bug (Invisible wall glitch). There is discussions to how to fix it, but it never works, thank the refund system.			"

												Freaking uncontrollable garbage. You can't even use the mouse because if you move the camera slows down a ton. If you try to fix it then the camera becomes even worse. And the view is like one inch away from you so that just excaberates the camera problems. Then you can use a gamepad and the game doesn't show it's controls in the options menu.			"
