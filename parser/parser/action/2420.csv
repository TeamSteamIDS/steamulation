												Welcome aboard the Ship: Single Player standalone campaign! Since this is a standalone campaign, if you want multi player, you'll need the Ship. You kick off this first person action, stealth, life simulator with a masked man telling you why he's brought you aboard his ship. Everyone aboard is to murder a specific someone, and look over their shoulder, because ultimately someone will trying to kill them. Its a beautiful premise that might be used better in the multiplayer version, because the single player version forgets about it after the first chapter or so and it falls into a standard game of do this for me and report back.On these missions, you'll need to murder people all while keeping an eye out for security and cameras. Other passengers don't care if they see me shoot someone. Its cool. If you so much as have a weapon out in front of a camera, you're instantly arrested and thrown in the brig for less than a minute. Its all an easy to follow green eye and red eye. If there's a green icon, you won't get punished, if there's a red eye you will.Like in real life, you have needs. You have hunger and thirst which you can die from. If you're thirsty you can't just drink from a sink like a deer on holiday. That's why I'm pretty sure your character is an alcoholic. He needs to sit down at a table near the bar to have a martini. Water doesn't count as hydration. You'll need entertainment and to use the bathroom. Both number one and number two have different meters. Of course if you wait too long to use the facilities you'll just go on the spot increasing the need for hygiene. You can shower to get clean, or the more efficient way is just to use the sink twice. Even if you unload, all it takes is a sink. The last need is the one to sleep. Sleeping aboard a ship with people out to kill you is an interesting prospect, but since this is single player, you're the only killer on board.You play as a silent protagonist named Charlie Panther. Your only motive is to get off the ship and there's a bellboy named Jimmy that will let you escape. It'll cost you though, one hundred large. How do you get the money? By doing missions of course. The first series are strict assassinations, murders of other passengers for the bartender. You collect the wallets and purses of your victims then return to the bartender to give him his cut. You can thank him with three different gratuities. Too little and he'll get angry with you. Then from there its stealing items for a wealthy lounge about. He's also got other people either searching for or guarding these treasures, so you'll need to take them out.Anyone in black is a criminal so its okay if you kill them. You can sneak up on them from behind. If they can't see you they forget about you, even if you just shot at them. Everyone in blue works for the ship itself. They're either security, clerks or nurses. Its a rule to not attack them. Everyone else is a civilian that if you kill them when you're not told to, you restart the chapter or the mission.So how do you murder people in the game? With weapons of course. You can't just find weapons, you need to buy them. Even a fire axe on a wall or a pool cue next to a billiard table needs to get purchased for thousands of dollars. Its a way to keep the game interesting. Pool cues, fire axes and prison shivs will always be there. Other items found in dressers and cabinets will deplete. So if you take an umbrella out of a dresser and you die, that umbrella will never be there again. That's why there are weapon lockers. These rare lockers are always full of random weapons to buy. For every weapon you'll see its damage stats, but not range stats. I assume that a katana covers more distance than a scalpel.There is more than just simple melee weapons. You've got a few different types of guns like pistols, tommy guns, rifles and even a musket from the 1800s. If those are too easy for you, there are sleeping syringes and poisons that kills a victim in a minute. Those feel more like story items than actual weapons. You can also find items to help you with your daily needs. Things like colostomy bags, energy drinks and food from vending machines if you can't make it to a restaurant.You hold all these items in a limited inventory. Anything more and you'll need to store stuff in a closet. The inventory felt over sized at least for the single player game. You can only have four active weapons to equip even if you're carrying eight of them. You can even throw the weapon, which is helpful for taking out goons that have guns.With all these weapons, the enemies have weapons too, both melee and guns. Their aim with guns is laughably bad, so just keep your distance if you're faced with someone that has a gun. Then just wait for them to run out of ammo. The enemies are too dumb to drop their weapons and fight. Instead they just keep trying to fire with nothing happening. Since you need to buy weapons, you can't just loot an enemy for their gun or ammunition.There is a map that shows you where you are and where your objective is. You can even see icons where everything else is located. I'm happy there's a map, but to be honest my player location felt inaccurate. The game would say I'm in a room, when I was in a corridor.The characters that give missions are all voice acted and it enhances the game. Talking with non essential characters results in silly gibberish like the Sims.The Ship is set in a vintage era. There are wall cameras, old televisions with rabbit ears. The decor is beautiful and classic. Like a black and white movie come to life in full color. The ship is all one big four floor map with no load times. D deck has the sick bay, brig, museum and several low class quarters. The C deck has shopping and higher class quarters. The shopping felt useless at least in this stand alone single player version. The B deck has a lot of outdoor areas, restaurants and bars. As for an A deck, I can't remember anything about it.With all that said, now its time for the negatives. I can recommend this game as a comedy of errors. I can murder someone in front of staff and no one cares. Just as long as I wasn't in the red. It didn't count. I was able to assassinate a person only to have their body fall at a guard's feet and he didn't mind. The masked Mr. X has everyone killing one another, yet you get busted for having a weapon equipped. It is his ship, this is his staff. Why should they care? The only condition is that I don't kill his staff. Rolling pins and claymore swords fit in dressers. People that I had killed were later seen up walking around. Video games use assets over and over again, but I felt a bond to the civilians I had killed, like I wouldn't see them again. The thugs and goons I knew I'd see again. People would go into pools with their clothes on. There were a few graphical issues, like a staircase with no railing when the rest had one. Certain outdoor railings didn't always connect to posts. These are all nit picks, but it all made me laugh when I would have overlooked the same things in other games.The bellboy Jimmy said that I needed one hundred thousand before he'd let me escape the ship. Well I had the one hundred thousand and I still had to go through the final two out of ten chapters. Then when I had blown a lot of money on weapons and had less than one hundred thousand, he still let me off the ship when I had finished the game. Its just laughable inconsistencies like this that made the game more fun.It was a funny four hours, even if I had to do several missions over and over. While I appreciate the developers making a Single Player campaign, I'm just not sure if I was laughing with the game or at the game.			"

												I got this game for $1 on bundlestars - it also came with the tutorial and multiplayer components (install separately). Considering the replayability, I think it is well-worth the price. I have played a game mode on Garry's Mod that was roughly similar to this game (one or two people are ""killers,"" and have to kill their targets while avoiding capture from a ""detective(s)."" Clues are sometimes given on the identity of the killer). The Ship has SOME elements from that popular game mod, however, do not expect the same game.If you like maintaining ""needs"" (like in The Sims series), Clue-style gameplay, hunting for your targets while avoiding witnesses, and (sometimes) random violence, then you should like The Ship.The aesthetics are good - there is enough detail in the scenery and different rooms to make the game world appear crisp and polished. The character models are a bit dated, however, the numerous outfits (clothes, hats, eyewear) and weapons add enough variety to keep things interesting. There isn't any music, but the weapon and other in-game sounds are decent. The controls are simple and typical of an FPS. The learning curve is minimal to moderate - the most challenging part of the game will probably be balancing the maintenance of your ""needs"" while also searching for your targets. It takes a bit of time to get used to the layout of the Ship, however, once you do this, orienting yourself and quickly locating your targets will become considerably easier. The tutorial is pretty quick and very helpful in familiarizing yourself with the gameplay mechanics - recommend trying it out first.I was expecting the singleplayer component of The Ship to simply be any of the multiplayer game modes (deathmatch, hunt, survival, etc) with bots in place of real human opponents, however, I was pleasantly surprised to find an actual ""story"" mode instead. The story is basic - passengers on a cruise ship are tasked with killing their targets for money, with the ""winner(s)"" being allowed to leave when the competition is over (aka Hunger Games/Battle Royale on a ship). The missions have a fair amount of variety - it is not simply ""kill x,"" ""kill y,"" however, most of the missions will still require you to kill a target. The elevators provide a much quicker route to the different decks of the ship. There are stores where you can purchase different outfits/hats/etc. Many of the rooms are lootable with random items (especially weapons). To manage your ""needs,"" you can do things like eat/drink consumables (which can be purchased from vending machines), use the bathroom, wash your hands/shower, sleep on beds/couches/chairs, talk to NPCs, and read books. The feedback is very good, the HUD will always show the needs that require the most immediate attention, and you can press ""N"" to view all of your needs. When you do relevant things, an up or down arrow will be shown next to the need(s) that your action is affecting. A green eye icon will let you know when there are no witnesses to your actions. Red icons or camera icons will indicate that witnesses are nearby or that you are in a camera's radius. Taking out a weapon and/or killing someone while you are visible will cause you to be arrested (and jailed). While in jail, you must wait for a certain amount of time before you can continue playing - you also lose a percentage of your money depending on your charges. During your jail time, this is a good time to attend to your needs (you can eat by interacting with the benches). Scoring is based on the money you have in your bank account. It is recommended that you periodically depost your money in order to protect it, however, be sure to keep a few hundred dollars to pay for things like food/drinks in the vending machine (when you can't find any while looting) or even outfits at the stores. During my playthroughs, I noticed that you will sometimes see the AI killing their targets - you can kill non-targets, however, you will not be paid any money. You can also check the weapons list for bonus money rewards based on different weapons you use to kill your targets.The singleplayer is fun, however, you should definitely take the time to try out the multiplayer component - if you can play with some friends, it will be especially fun.If you like murdering victims while trying to remain anonymous, give this game a try.Recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												The Ship: Singleplayer Campaign! I like it. It's very different from other Source games. You start as someone on a ship where a man named Mr. X is controlling everyone. You have a quarry you have to kill, but you are also being hunted. Seems like a good game. The first part of the game shows you what to kill and how to kill your quarry. After that, you can meet a bellboy that tells you how to get off of the ship for $100,000.  Around the ship, you complete missions to collect money and get off the ship. The story is really nice. I don't think it needs polishing or anything. It's good enough. The story and game feel is nice, but the gameplay falls short. There's nothing wrong with the controls or the movement, but your character has basic human needs. Needs such as sleeping, using the restroom, personal hygiene, and talking to other people. These make the game more ""realistic"", but it really is impractical. Most of the time, you have to search the ship just to find a chair, or a shower, or a restroom, and it really isn't fun. It takes away from the mission! I'll mind my own business, trying to steal the Holy Grail, when all of a sudden I need to shower. There aren't many things to carry out your life processes on the ship unless you know where to look. I'm not saying these things are bad, I'm just saying that it takes away from the story.The Ship is a good game.			"

												Nice idea but too easy and way too short. A very linear game, with an idea like this the makers should really explore all the possibilities. As it is it feels sort of unfinished.

												The Ship is HORRIBLE as a single player game. Outerlight must have felt obligated to add a singleplayer campagin and while I appreciate the effort, the final product is just terrible. It's honselty more fun playing against bots in the multiplayer client.This is literally the entire game:Talk to someone.They want you to kill someone else.You walk to the person you're supposed to kill.You kill them, usually by clicking on them.You walk back to the person who hired you.They give you money and tell you either the next person they want you to kill or the next person you're going to work for.Repeat for 2 hours.Sometimes they'll change it up and force you to wear a disguise before killing them but it's just..so...dull.Also the ending is hilariously dumb and I'm pretty sure there's only 2 voice actors doing the voices for everyone.

												While the single player of The Ship is really only supposed to prepare you for the multiplayer, it is in itself not a terrible game. It's more or less what you'd expect; clue on a ship except you're supposed to kill people without being found out. The gameplay is decent and the graphics are on par with it's era, but if you can't get a good server, the singler player is really all that's left. That being said, if you and a few friends want to goof around and make your own game lobbies, the multiplayer is fantastically fun, and single player can prepare you for that. I'm not going to reccomend this game on the basis that it's replay value is virtually non-existant, but it's still a fun game and that shouldn't deter you if you think that this game is exactly what you need in your life.

 A Good Pathway for Multi-PlayerThis single-player experience of the ship is good for players wanting to see what the game is about before going into multiplayer. The start lays out a good tutorial of the game to come and a few levels to get you started. However, as you progress through the levels, it gets a little easier but i guess that means that you are ready for multi-player!			"

English Version: I bought this game a few years ago (in fact it was released in 2006), but I've decided only recently to play this game in order to finish the single player campaign, which intrigued me indeed.The gameplay is very exciting, although my expectations were not met completely(not chased by anyone for killing you, excluding in the start). The plot is almost non-existent, in order to appreciate the graphics you have to consider that this is an old game, and the soundtracks are pretty neutral to me, nothing extraordinary. Another flaw is the lack of longevity: in fact it took me just a few hours to complete the game. But I liked this game for the simple fact that's a DIFFERENT idea, from the classic shooter '' shoots shoots''. And different is good.I'd advise you to buy It during a sale timeP.s.: The Multiplayer is dead, if you wanted to play online, forget it.Italian Version: Sono venuta in possesso di questo gioco qualche anno fa (difatti è del 2006), tuttavia l'ho ripreso da poco per finire la storia in single-player, che mi incuriosiva.Il gameplay è molto stimolante, seppur non abbia rispettato diverse mie aspettative (non vi inseguirà nessuno per uccidervi, escluso l'inizio). La trama è quasi inesistente, la grafica è ciò che è, essendo un gioco vecchiotto, e le colonne sonore sono abbastanza neutre, niente di straordinario. Un'altra pecca è la poca longevità, mi ha intrattenuto giusto qualche ora. Tuttavia questo gioco mi è piaciuto per il semplice fatto che è un'idea DIVERSA dal classico shooter ''spara spara''. E diverso è bello. Lo consiglio, tuttavia meglio aspettare gli sconti, per acquistarlo.P.s.: Il Multiplayer è morto, se volevate giocarci online, lasciate perdere.			"

												There are so many ways this game ♥♥♥♥s up I feel like I'd waste way too much time delving into all of them so I'll label the main ones I found in my brief 2 hour playthrough before uninstalling this game and wishing I had never witnessed such garbage.#1. Reading a book is a life necesity. seriously, you need to go through about 10 books an hour to LIVE. I go through maybe 10 books a year and I am indeed alive.#2. In the game there's a security camera system called the ""Eye of doom"" (dumbest name ever by the way) and it makes so whenever you get caught wielding a weapon in public you get arrested (see #3 for my rant on being arrested). This sounds like a cool system and all to add some stealth and timing to the game but here are a few things that pass for ""weapons"" aboard the Ship: A sewing needle, a ball of yarn, a syringe, a mannequin arm, a pot, a fire extinguisher, a knife (my issue with this one is that it's a steak knife and you're on a rather fancy ship so these are distributed quite often whenever someone orders a dinner that requires a knife).#3. what is your grand punishment for getting caught with one of these deadly balls of yarn? THIRTY SECONDS IN JAIL! No joke, 30 seconds and a little fine. Also, the main premise of the game is that the ship is owned by a man who hired all these people on his private ship and then told the passengers to kill one another to escape the ship... if that's the case, then WHY THE HELL DO YOU GET ARRESTED IN THE FIRST PLACE?!?! If this game is about murdering others, and the man who's making you murder others controls this ship and all the crew aboard, then WHY DO YOU GET ARRESTED FOR DOING WHAT YOU'RE TOLD?!? This little logic loop here confuses me to this day.#4. when you get hungry, you eat, when you eat, you have to poop (near instantly by the way), when you have to poop you run to a bathroom and poop, when you run to a bathroom and poop you lower your hygiene, when you lower your hygiene you have to shower, when you have to shower, there is only ONE available shower and it's on the bottom floor of the ship way out of the way of any objectives meaning you have to run all the way down there and shower. And after you've done all that walking.... YOU'RE HUNGRY AGAIN!!! This makes progressing really hard.#5. If you don't shower every 10 minutes, you get a deadly disease and die. I can personaly tell you from going a week without a shower (I was camping, don't judge) that you can live.#6. The voice work is just.... bad....#7. When you kill someone, they ragdoll and fly 50 feet.#8. There is this song in the brig that annoys me so much. Whenever you go to jail you have to hear it. It's almost like that's the real punishment for being caught by the ""Eye of Doom""#9. The game has a seperate game just for the tutorial.#10. It's just a bad game (that and I wanted to end my list on an even number.)Please save yourself some money and never buy this game. "

												Throw away your moral compass, because you won't be needing it! The premise is simple. A mystery man tells everybody aboard a luxury cruise ship that every passenger has been assigned to kill someone else. They may choose not to play this twisted game, but they must remember that they may also be hunted too. You play as one of these passengers.Aside from murdering yourself towards freedom off the ship using a multitude of weapons, you'll be disguising yourself, avoiding security, stealing, and taking care of your... ""needs"". As with real-life, you'll need to juggle your character's hunger and thirst among other needs to continue your survival challenge. Elements like these add a little more complexity to the fray to make things a lot more interesting.It's quite apparent that the developers took their time with polishing the gameplay to make it all work well. The single player campaign serves as a great tutorial extension that leads into the multiplayer, which is simply asymmetrical greatness. Yay murder!			"

												This game was really fun to play. There are 10 chapters, and of them, only 2 were challenging. The graphics were not the best, but it did make the game easy on your computer. I was able to run it perfectly fine, and I have a pretty bad computer overall. The game is fun if you can get a basic layout of the ship early enough so that you can collect firearms easily. Bombs, on the other hand, are somewhat hard to come by.Overall this game is pretty fun, But it's best bought with the multiplayer version as well. Its really only around 3-4 hours of gameplay if you take it somewhat slow-ish. 8/10 game, would recommend to friends			"

												Review is for the single-player only:Summary: A short, silly single-player campaign that isn't worth your time.This quickie single-player component was, I believe, tacked on to the multiplayer component at some point early on to make the game feel more complete.Pros:-The cast of characters is goofy and somewhat memorable.-It teaches you basic mechanics of the game that will help you in multiplayer.Cons:-It's short. It takes about 3 hours to complete if you don't get stuck anywhere.-The missions vary in difficulty. The hardest mission is in the middle of the game where you have to wheel the diplomat around in his wheelchair.-I believe the wheelchair mission is impossible on hard difficulty. If you can do it, tell me.-The plot makes no sense. Why are there random goons all over the ship working for Mr. X? Aren't they part of the hunt game too? How will collecting money buy your way off the ship when you can just jump on a lifeboat? Ah, whatever.Also, the single-player portion is being deleted/consolidated in the near future with the other components (?). So everyone with the single-player should have the multiplayer too? In any event, go play online, not this.Also, while I'm at it, the tutorial sucks. It teaches you nothing about combat or stealth, just how to manage your needs. But it takes 10 minutes, so whatever.			"

												The Singleplayer version of the ship focuses on the storyline of what the game is solemly about.Much like the multiplayer version, you still have the basic needs system and can find weapons and clothing around the ship.Unlike the MP version, there is the more in-depth storyline. You will meet characters that do not appear in the MP.While it is worth playing once, it isn't worth coming back unless you really enjoyed the game. If you liked the MP, this will be at the least, an interesting insight into a more solo play of the Ship.The game sets itself in 10 chapters. If you die or fail a mission, you will have to restart the whole chapter. Each chapter can take around 10-15 mins, so overall the game can be completed really quick. On the otherhand, some chapters can prove very hard and unfair, so expect to fail atleast once and have to redo a whole chapter.I would recommend this game but only for once, as there's not much to come back for.

												The Ship Single Player is effectively an extended tutorial for The Ship's multiplayer game, lasting a little over an hour. The player is given a series of tasks from an NPC which all involve killing one or multiple people in a variety of ways while avoiding detection. It's a good overview of the mechanics, but as an independent game, there's not a whole lot to it, so I can't really recommend it. Additionally, there's a few mechanical issues on a couple of the quests that can cause game-breaking bugs where you have to reload your save (for example, not getting into an elevator and going downstairs a different way in one circumstance).I can't speak for the multiplayer game's community at this point, and I suppose it might be worth it for people who intend to dive wholeheartedly into the game so they can have some extra experience when going in, but as a standalone game, there's not much there.

												This game is actually a good game but the problem with it (IMO) is that there is no ""save"" option. yeah sure the game autosaves for you, but only at the begining of missions. this would be fine if it werent for the long missions and the way to impossible objectives... i havent beaten the game, im at a mission where i am supposed to body guard an ambassador... sounds simple. the only problem is that you need to hit the enemies 2 times (doesnt matter if its melee or ranged) and the ambassador dies in one hit... its actually not that hard but the fact that you have to stand behind the ambassador and push him in order to move makes him the most easy target on the ♥♥♥♥ing planet and since he dies in one hit there is nothing you can do... ive replayed this ♥♥♥♥ing mission like 6 times... i even know where and when the enemies respawn and still i cannot finish this ♥♥♥♥ing mission, the last ""assassin"" has a gun and i manage to hit him once with my gun but he maneges to shoot the ambassador and i keep failing!... and the worst thing is i lose at the END of the mission... and since there is no save i have to start ALL OVER AGAIN! ♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME#ragequitEDITED!i have now beaten the game and i can say that it is a really short ""campaign"" and i do not think its worth the 5€. the campaign is about 8 missions, and they arent hard (as i mentiond before they are, IMO, unfair)			"

You have to feed, sleep, poop, entertain etc.. all while hunting down your marks.I would love to play this with just the story and the murders. Lower marks for too much work.Worth $3.

												The Ship MP is a really cool concept and generally well-executed. The single player campaign is mostly just frustrating. It strays from the concept of the multiplayer and instead gives retrieval objectives that are usually hindered by an enemy ambush. I am probably just really bad at playing it, but I thought the controls were ill-suited to the task of defending yourself against an AI that knows you're coming. The checkpoint system is a lesser gripe, but it always starts you at the very beginning of an objective, which I found it makes continuing after failure very discouraging.			"

												Fantastic art, good concept, good map, BUTTTT.....-single player lacks any sugnificant story line, and also lacking in gameplay. -Multiplayer also has a very interesting concept, everyone has one person they are sopost to kill. Kill your target before you're killed! bonus points for killing your target with interesting weapons (ex. candle stick, as opposed to a shotgun) HOWEVER.... Single player mode usually degrades to a bunch of 8 year olds who are bored with CoD running around and killing    whoever they damn well please (target or no) with shot guns and katanas and whatever other 1 shot kill weapons they can find.

												For a $1, i got what i paid for, a big issue is doors open into you, and you don't phase through the open door, it pushes you into a corner, biggest pain in the butt, every door you have to open and then step back, just poor planning, second of all is the commands are clunky, just going throuh your inventory and having to equipt weapons or use books, gets annoying.  The mission system is poorly defined, you can play through a mission and kill 10 or so people or complete a couple mini quest along the way, but if you go to jail or kill the wrong person its reverts as if you never did anything during that npc's mission.Only redeeming quality the game has is the developer console and its online play(though about 50% of the commands don't work on a 7 year old game), fun for a pick up match with a buddy.

												I hate this game so much , I just hate it to it's core, the ♥♥♥♥ing doors, ♥♥♥♥ING DOORS, JESUS JUST STOP HITTING YOUR HEAD OFF OF THE DAMN DOORS, ♥♥♥♥, *Ahem* Just ♥♥♥♥ this game, I swear to god, one shot deaths, guards that only care if you have a weapon and then only for like a minute because, I DON'T KNOW WHY, DO THEY ALL HAVE SHORT TERM MEMORY LOSS OR SOMETHING?? I was having fun with all the different ways to kill people, all of the ridiculous weapons, like a ♥♥♥♥ING MANNEQUIN'S ARM?? WHO KEEPS THAT SOMEWHERE ON A BOAT?? *Ahem* No it's great and then it gets stupid, like just butt scratchingly stupid, see how that doesn't make sense WELL NEITHER DOES THIS GAME, ♥♥♥♥ING HELL!! After reading that I am sure you're asking yourself why I recommend this game, one reason, you can blow people up with fake wallets. 11/10 too many explosions not enough bodies. Also, ALSO WHY DO YOU GET ♥♥♥♥ING ARRESTED FOR MURDERING PEOPLE WHEN YOU ARE HAVING A MURDER PARTY?! THAT'S LIKE TELLING PEOPLE NOT TO EAT AT A PIE EATING COMPETITION OR SOME ♥♥♥♥. The AI's aim is also astounding, I mean X must have hired these people for their eyes rather then their ♥♥♥♥ING MEMORY, LIKE ""OH LOOK THIS GUYS BACK IN JAIL AGAIN, WHAT FOR THE ♥♥♥♥ING 19'000 TIME, HOW LONG THIS TIME?"" ""Sixty seconds"" ""Sounds ♥♥♥♥ING fair to me."" Also, also, also, WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ IS THE POINT OF HOSTING THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME IF YOU CAN'T WATCH IT YOURSELF, LIKE X JUST HAD THE WORST PLAN EVER, ""I want you all to murder one another, but I want you to do it so that I don't get to see it."" THIS MAKES NO SENSE!! ALSO THIS RANDOM WOMAN CAME UP TO ME AFTER I HAD MURDERED 10 PEOPLE AND SHE JUST SAID REALLY QUIETLY, ""You..."" THE MONEY FOR KILLS THING ALSO DOESN'T MAKE SENSE LIKE IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE, YOU DON'T GET EXTRA CASH AT THE END OF EVERY MISSION, IT JUST DOESN'T WORK. This has been a rant more then a review but I needed to just express all my hatred for this game. Yet at the same time I love it because it is just THE WORST.			"

However the learning curve takes a few games to get over. After that youll be fine.If anything could be said on the advent of 2014, its that this game has aged amazingly well.

												This single player version of the game is really just for practicing how to play before trying the multiplayer game. It is not a particularly fun game to play in itself. The concept is so over the top ridiculous that it makes it a bit amusing though. The gameplay itself is no good at all, you mostly just walk around the ship searching for weapons and other items which can be absolutely anywhere and then do some shooting/slashing/hitting of targets with no AI, while keeping track of your needs and finding food, showers etc to satisfy them. None of this poses much of any challenge or is particularly fun. It does teach you a bit about how to play the multiplayer game, but that is it.			"

												Haven't played through yet, but found this very interesting/entertaining. In The Sims, a person has stats like hunger, sleep and such - The Ship gives the same kind of stats to you, the 1st person 3D character. ""Duh - survival games have this often."" Well, you'll see that the comparison specifically to The Sims (in regards to the stats) is apt.			"

												This is the story mode for the game. THE STORY MODE, PEOPLE, NOT THE MULTIPLAYER PORTION. Don't let this review deceive you, Arcade Mode (Multiplayer) is damn good and I highly recommend it. I can't say the same for the single player story, hence this review.It wasn't the worst I've ever seen, but it just doesn't live up to Arcade mode. Since you move so slow and can only sprint for a short while, and the map makes little to no sense, getting from point A to point B becomes too much of a chore. Do yourself a favor and skip the story mode; Arcade mode is where the game is most fun.			"

												The Ship is a decent interactive story, you find yourself trapped on a cruse ship and informed by the devious Mr. X that the only way to possibly save your life is to play his game and slay the other passengers onboard. this sets the direction for the rest of the game, simply learning the layout of the giant ship and scroungeing for weapons and neccesities to help you get off the boat. and the game does its best to create the look and feel of being on a large cruse ship with all the extras and exploration is part of the fun of the game. now for some of the issues I had, now please note that i've only played through on easy so i dont know how or if the story changes based on difficulty. quickly after i found my target and took it out, the focus shifted away from Mr. X's game to doing oddjobs to buy passage off the boat. in fact though he says in his intro that he would be ""checking in on us from time to time' hes never seen again outside of a large statue of himself onboard. also I imagine as a way to help pace the gameplay  so the player isnt just turning into a murder hobo on a boat the game has 2 features the first is a 'needs' system in the sims vein where you have to eat/sleep/restroom/ect. or suffer consequences for letting them go on without paying attention to them. i know this was to help with interaction but it didnt really work out too well. the second is the onboard Security. stationed throughout the ship are guards and video cameras that cant be disabled ingame or in the case of teh living guards killed, because the moment you step infront of either while wielding a weapon of any kind your instantly jailed, stripped of all weapons, fined based on the amount and variety of weapons found on you and left to roam around an empty brig. once again this is to prevent the player from going on rampage but it just slows you down  as you have to roam around to regain a useful supply of weapons to continue along the storyline. overall its a good game and teh story was strong and intresting enough that I wanted to see it to the end.

												The Ship: Singleplayer Campaign! I like it. It's very different from other Source games. You start as someone on a ship where a man named Mr. X is controlling everyone. You have a quarry you have to kill, but you are also being hunted. Seems like a good game. The first part of the game shows you what to kill and how to kill your quarry. After that, you can meet a bellboy that tells you how to get off of the ship for $100,000. Around the ship, you complete missions to collect money and get off the ship. The story is really nice. I don't think it needs polishing or anything. It's good enough. The story and game feel is nice, but the gameplay falls short. There's nothing wrong with the controls or the movement, but your character has basic human needs. Needs such as sleeping, using the restroom, personal hygiene, and talking to other people. These make the game more ""realistic"", but it really is impractical. Most of the time, you have to search the ship just to find a chair, or a shower, or a restroom, and it really isn't fun. It takes away from the mission! I'll mind my own business, trying to steal the Holy Grail, when all of a sudden I need to shower. There aren't many things to carry out your life processes on the ship unless you know where to look. I'm not saying these things are bad, I'm just saying that it takes away from the story.The Ship is a good game.			"

												The ship single player is a overall unique game. The idea and the story in it are very well put together and the gamepley isn't that bad either. It's great for people who like to just play games casually. But don't get me wrong, there are some parts of the game that will make you scream in frusturation and possibly throw your computer out your window. But besides that, the graphics are nice, the controls are easy, and the weapons are awesome.Just the fact that you can kill someone with a maniquen arm is a hint that this game is the best. 7/10!

												Think of Assassins Creed Multiplayer, now add the needs of the Sims. You have to kill a target while also being stalked by another and at the same time you've begun to stink, you're starving and need to take a poop. Good thing your target is busy reading a book.			"

I like the story and array of weapons.But like all games thee are bugs.I would still recomend this game either way because it is fun to play online.I also think that it's kind of col that you have to kill every one on the ship to live.

												This game was obviously designed to be multiplayer. Basically, instead of stalking quarries to kill them without being noticed, you become hired muscle. Every target you are told to assasinate convienently is out of camera view. Nobody is hunting you. There's no manual saving feature, so you have to restart every mission from a distant checkpoint if you fail.This version makes a chore out of the multiplayer game, and removes it's best aspects. Don't get this as a standalone.			"

												Okay, First im going to reveiw the Story mode, then ill get to the multiplayer and count them as seperate games, which they are in fact. Now then to the reveiw:Wow... Just... Wow... XD I wasnt really expecting this one, Im kind of on the fence with this game, but i lean more towards reccomending. Um Its really fun to me, but the story is a bit lacking. So the catagories: Storyline, Weapon and Tool Originality, Fighting, Character customization and generation, And the Overall thought. Without further ado, i give you my reveiw: (heh i rhymed, ♥♥♥♥ing shoot me in the face if i do that again) :DStoryline: 3.7/10The storyline, While on the boat is quite informative, is a bit lacking on both the backstory of the main protaganist and the other boat...members? The storyline is an important part of any singleplayer game and i was quite dissapointed in it, the gameplay on the other hand... This was the main problem with me reccomending this title but there are so many good things about this game i just couldnt go through with not doing so.Weapon and Tool Originality: 7/10The Weapons in this game are a bit, How do you say? Well there arent many, but what there are, are so crazy and fun, you barely give a ♥♥♥♥, not even half a ♥♥♥♥, maybe 1/4, MAYBE. The weapon choice in this game blends beautifully with the environment of the time, sometimes (most of the time) oddly placed, but otherwise easy to come accross.Fighting: 5.1/10Yes i realize im being a bit harsh on this game, considering how much i love this game, but the fighting seems a bit, Stale, if you will, or fake. it looks like theyre acting, and badly, The A.I. in this game however, is wonderful, and i just love it, As well as the ragdolling.Character Generation and Customization: 6.7/10There is NO character creation in this game, But... the generation of the characters is a healthy ammount, while there arent too many models, theres always clothing, accessories, names. I think it could use more, but i love this the way it is so im on the fence, I realize that this game is complete and will never get updates, But i like to dream you little sh- And now for the overall game.Overall Gameplay: 7.3/10While this game has missed a couple of marks, the gameplay is really fun and charasmatic, the challenge is great, and the quests are nice and different from eachother (sometimes) and i really do love this game, go and buy it if its on sale, people.

												This game (at least the single player portion of it) seems like something that could be good and interesting, all the fun components are in place: a ship with people who have been given motivation to hunt each other down, systems to manage your needs sims style which ensures that you can't just hunker down but have to keep yourself fed and equiped to fight off an attack. So what's wrong with it? The single player does nothing with all this, you just walk around and do quests in the ship enviroment and that's it. It's like being in an amusement park all alone except for the occasional employee in a mascott costume to point you around to the next attraction. The novelty of being able to explore and manipulate with a lot of objects will wear off quick and you're left with a game that's basically a series of fetch quests with occasional combat or assassination thrown in. And then the game ends, no real build up or conclusion. For all this, the single player portion of the game isn't really interesting beyond the first few minutes.			"

												A horrible montonous campain for a multiplayer oriented game. You get almost nothing from playing this besides learning your way around the ship a decent amount and what to do to manage your personal ""needs"". Other than that its a painfull waste of time with missions setting you back 15 mins if you mess up in the rigth spot. This with the combination of dieing in 2 hits makes the least amount of fun to be had.I do give them credit , the story did gived me a couple chuckles here and there and the character animation was good enough.Conclusion to all of this, don't touch the single player campain unless you are desberate to do something.

												This game was really fun to play. There are 10 chapters, and of them, only 2 were challenging. The graphics were not the best, but it did make the game easy on your computer. I was able to run it perfectly fine, and I have a pretty bad computer overall. The game is fun if you can get a basic layout of the ship early enough so that you can collect firearms easily. Bombs, on the other hand, are somewhat hard to come by.Overall this game is pretty fun, But it's best bought with the multiplayer version as well. Its really only around 3-4 hours of gameplay if you take it somewhat slow-ish. 8/10 game, would recommend to friends			"

The Ship really does have a fantastic story/gameplay setup. It's enjoyable enough just experiencing the rarity of exploring a big ship out in the empty ocean. Even better when random spawning of objects urges you to search carefully and plan your approach for objectives and merely surviving on this pretty but dangerous cruise. In no way can I fault the developer for their ideas and ambition in development. The issue here in particular is that instead of being no more than an offline version, it tries to insert a 'campaign'. Despite never having much cleverness in the way of writing and design, it could still have been moderately enjoyable were it not so difficult. Around halfway through, the tasks become frustrating with ambushes that make it almost impossible to complete on the first playthrough of a mission. And that comes not only with low hit points, but also lack of manual/quick-save feature. Were it fixing most of these things, this single player mode could have been better and more fun by miles. Still can be enjoyable though, if you are willing to endure some frustrations.55/100			"

												Okay, First im going to reveiw the Story mode, then ill get to the multiplayer and count them as seperate games, which they are in fact. Now then to the reveiw:Wow... Just... Wow... XD I wasnt really expecting this one, Im kind of on the fence with this game, but i lean more towards reccomending. Um Its really fun to me, but the story is a bit lacking. So the catagories: Storyline, Weapon and Tool Originality, Fighting, Character customization and generation, And the Overall thought. Without further ado, i give you my reveiw: (heh i rhymed, ♥♥♥♥ing shoot me in the face if i do that again) :DStoryline: 3.7/10The storyline, While on the boat is quite informative, is a bit lacking on both the backstory of the main protaganist and the other boat...members? The storyline is an important part of any singleplayer game and i was quite dissapointed in it, the gameplay on the other hand... This was the main problem with me reccomending this title but there are so many good things about this game i just couldnt go through with not doing so.Weapon and Tool Originality: 7/10The Weapons in this game are a bit, How do you say? Well there arent many, but what there are, are so crazy and fun, you barely give a ♥♥♥♥, not even half a ♥♥♥♥, maybe 1/4, MAYBE. The weapon choice in this game blends beautifully with the environment of the time, sometimes (most of the time) oddly placed, but otherwise easy to come accross.Fighting: 5.1/10Yes i realize im being a bit harsh on this game, considering how much i love this game, but the fighting seems a bit, Stale, if you will, or fake. it looks like theyre acting, and badly, The A.I. in this game however, is wonderful, and i just love it, As well as the ragdolling.Character Generation and Customization: 6.7/10There is NO character creation in this game, But... the generation of the characters is a healthy ammount, while there arent too many models, theres always clothing, accessories, names. I think it could use more, but i love this the way it is so im on the fence, I realize that this game is complete and will never get updates, But i like to dream you little sh- And now for the overall game.Overall Gameplay: 7.3/10While this game has missed a couple of marks, the gameplay is really fun and charasmatic, the challenge is great, and the quests are nice and different from eachother (sometimes) and i really do love this game, go and buy it if its on sale, people. DO IT NOW.Thank you SO SO much for reading this reveiw!!POWER TO THE PIGGLEZ <3(grenda voice activate)PIGGLEZ			"

												The Ship: Single Player seems to be an addon to the multiplayer. The game campaign itself only lasts 1-2 hours, including endless repetition of unfairly hard missions.The gameplay is repetitive.The plot is poor. It involves the protagonist talking to several stereotypical characters and doing various tasks for them. The ending makes a poor attempt at being meaninful, but falls on its face.This was included with the full game of The Ship, which is the only reason I played it.I enjoyed Arcade Mode, with bots replacing human players, on the regular version of the game more than this.

												I thought the single player game would be as fun as the Multiplayer game (both of them install completely separating, including a 10 minute tutorial that takes up a third space in your Steam Library), but it doesn't even compare. It doesn't live up to arcade mode. It has a good idea that should have built onto the multiplayer mode by giving the player goals and objectives to complete as a way to escape off the Ship everyone is trapped on, but it adds nothing. With very simple shallow gameplay, there's not a whole lot to this game. All it is, is a long string of repetitive tedious fetch quests, running from to one place to get something and then running back to the exact same place you were at previously only to do this two more times. Getting from point A to B is such a chore even, often getting lost and needing to back track because your location on the map isn't accurate. Your pinpoint is constantly in an area beside your actual location, thus disorientating your sense of direction and making you double check and guess where to go. There are other glitches too that hinder your progress, such as elevators not working. There was a guy even who was completely frozen in front of the door I needed to go through, and it was the only door to that area. There were security cameras so I couldn't even hit him, and when I stood back and threw weapons at him, nothing happened. The game registered him as an object instead of a kill-able person. The voice acting is bad, and the animation is really stiff and bad. The mouths barely move when characters are talking, and in the case of the opening cutscene, the characters were reduced to bean poles. They stood there very lifeless, not even moving, and didn't even react verbally or with facial expressions when the antagonist, Mr. X, revealed that they were trapped on the ship and would be forcing the crew members to murder each other against their will. The opening itself was even very corny, as well as how the story line is executed. A good concept, but done poorly. The way the NPC's react to your character is very odd I thought, and not at all realistic. From the very beginning, a bellboy wants to help you get off the ship, and he chooses you instead of all the other passengers because he says he likes the way you kill, which I thought was very strange. The other NPC's, who offer to give you money in exchange for completing certain tasks (so you can afford the bellboy's 100,000$ ticket to somehow get off the boat) seem by no means distressed or even concerned about Mr. X destroying the boat after all the games are done. They just care about making money. Perhaps the NPC's aren't aware of what's going on, but from my understanding by the cutscene, Mr. X had locked all the crew members inside a room to tell them about what he was doing. It seems eerily and very creepy that none of the NPC's care about the disturbing things going on aboard of the ship or that they'll all be killed. Further more, what also doesn't make sense is that the guards will arrest you if you are seen holding a weapon or hurting someone. These guards are stated in the opening to be hired by Mr. X, who explains that he wants them left out of the killing because the uniforms are expensive. Why would you get taken to the jail cell for murdering when that's exactly what Mr. X is wanting the crew members to do? Yes, it adds to the challenge but plot wise, it makes no sense. This game is so basic I couldn't wait to complete the first chapter. It was very long winded and filled with back tracking. In fact the entire gist of that chapter was backtracking, backtracking again and oh wait, more backtracking. At the end of it, you need to protect an Ambassador and are thrown three different enemies to kill, but it's unfair because they run to kill the Ambassador who you are behind because you need to push him in a wheel chair. You don't have enough time to get in front of him to kill the bad guys. They always come out of no where, and in the case of the final one, he jumps out with a gun and shoots immediately. It's very hard to react to fast enough, not because of bad reflexes but because the character's movements aren't quick enough. It's unfair cheap deaths, and you will be replaying that part again and again trying to succeed. Over all this game is simple, repetitive, and annoying and not worth playing. I was bored the entire time playing this and couldn't possibly endure another chapter. Skip this game and buy the multiplayer version instead, but even then I don't recommend that game for full price.			"

I had a lot of fun playing it and had a lot of fun losing my temper when ever I failed a mission. the positives of this game are the setting as well as the story! the big things I didn't like about it though was that it didn't fully explain what to do in some missions (i.e The Dognapper Mission) and also the game doesn't tell you that you can not reveal weapons to security and also in front of cameras! one big thing that frusturated me was the gauges that show your hunger, thurst, bowel movements, ect. but all in all this was a fun game, not my favorite, but still good. 7/10			"

												The ship single player story was promising, you're a tourist trapped in a death cruise where Mr. X is playing a little game , everyone got a target to kill, hunt or be hunted, your goal is to survive and escape the ship, so far so good but 10min in game you'll just forget about mr.x completely.All you do in this game is linear story missions mostly just killing people to raise an enormous amount of money in order to buy your ticket out of the ship.During the game no more transmissions from Mr. X will happen but you can clearly tell who's mr x after just a few minutes, the ai is stupid you can approach a guy with an axe and he won't bother to run away, unless there's a guard or security camera watching you, which if they are you'll go to prison for a few minutes... really.Even if you get the money before the last mission you'll be forced to continue doing them, and most likely you'll get the money before last 2 missions if you don't spend it all, nothing there to spend them on anyways.

												To start off let me say the the The Ship: Singleplayer is an interesting idea, poorly executed...The Singleplayer addon to the uniquely blended multiplayer game The Ship is a curious one...with many faults.The Singleplayer part of the game (actually it is more of a mod actually) try's to act as a introduction and tutorial to The Ship.The opening scene of the game starts with a bunch of captured idiots watching a television in which Mr. X is broadcasting himself. He then proceeds to tell them that he likes to play a game...a game where you shall receive a quarry, in which you must proceed to kill without you yourself getting killed. You receive money for killing your quarry without being killed by your hunter. You earn extra money by killing your quarry with ""unusual"" weapons (frying pans, syringe, hammer, croquet racket, flare gun etc.). Whoever is left standing at the end is the winner.Oh, and another thing, you have to eat, sleep, entertain yourself, stay happy, stay clean, pee, poop...If you don't take care of your ""needs"" consequences to make things more difficult for you will occur. So for instance if you don't sleep you'll be unable to sprint, and fall asleep at random moments. If you don't eat you will stave and die. If you don't entertain yourself and stay happy, you will commit suicide. If you don't stay clean you'll turn into a pile of dust. If you don't go to the bathroom, you'll either pee, or poop on yourself...or both.  The Singleplayer addition try's to teach you these basic things. Many parts of the game seems as if it was created by a third party modder, who wanted to make their own version of The Ship without slaughtering general concept.The graphics are the same as the original game and have not improvements whatsoever. Nothing to complain about here, but nothing to be impressed with.The sound remains the same, as the repetitive music plays itself over and over and over again...The worst portion of the game is perhaps is a annoying voice acting. The characters voices are fake and totally unbelievable. They don't bring life to the characters, rather they bring stupidity and gullibility. The gameplay is boring and very simple. The game will set you up in a situations like, where you have to stalk two unsuspecting women (yeah, REALLY unsuspecting) into the bathroom and slaughter them while they are in the restroom...like...duh! Don't freak out cuz there is a guy with an axe chasing you into the WOMENS' bathroom! They don't even fight back either they just let you hack away...So the gameplay was a fail. As a game no. As a tutorial, yes.I must admit I learned a lot about how to play the game though this. Not that I couldn't have learned it myself, but hey, I got the game for free so I can't complain...Overall Rating: 5/10Presentation: 6/10Gameplay: 5/10Story: 4/10Graphics: 6/10Sound: 4/10Lasting Appeal: 4/10Overall Rating: 5/10			"

												This game has a really good story, its about this crazy guy Mr X causing his own passengers to murder eachother. But it is hard to play as the mapping system is quite hard. Also whats so stupid is when you attack someone infront of the guards they will arrest you, but when it comes to npcs attacking you like someone is assigned to murder you they won't arrest the npc thats attacking. If you try and attack them back you will get arrested that should be seriously fixed.			"

												A battle-royale simulator that takes ques from games like the Sims and Hitman.  A mysterious man threatens the entire people on the ship by enforcing a battle-royale.  Things take a turn the moment you hunt down your first victim as you try to make sense of the insanity aboard.You have to constantly manage your character's needs from reading, eating, drinking and cleanliness in order to consistently be on top of your performance.  Money is earned depending on what type of weapon you use based on the requirements. The downside to this game as it lacks core focus, having the gameplay set-up as a farce in favor of the narrative designed by the creator.  Game has fun, but it also lacks balance causing you to find exploits within the game to have the upper hand.  Damage has no indicator for both player and NPC's making the game frustrating when enemies are capable of taking you down instantly with no sense of rhyme or reason.  Saving is automated through chapters which means failing a mission would cause you to restart from the beginning of the chapter.Despite all this, the game is relatively interesting for it's concept as many of the stealth/assassination games are focused on power-fantasy dudebro market.  This is probably closer to the passive nature of Splinter Cell & Hitman in terms of pacing which may interest those looking for a more focused game.  A little polish could make this game reach its potential but clearly a concept sold as a work-in-progress.  Best check it out for a steam sale if the premise deem to risky for your cash.   "

												Unfortunately, not as good as expected...I just don't understand some things about game mechanics.I don't understand why character has to go pee every 5 minutes (also eat, drink etc.).This is simulation? OK, then this ship is maybe over 9000 meters long so the hero is so tired going from one side to another?I peed, went from deck D to deck C and I have to pee once again. Boring.Instead of hunt, I just playing sims.This looks good only for one reason: it is better to kill somebody in the toilet rather then in the corridor.So making everybody to go pee every 5 minutes is a solution to make everybody be in the silent places.But it is really annoying. There had to be other solutions, I think.The other thing is the rules. Everybody has a ticket to kill a query.And ship is full of different weapons.But you can't hold this weapon in your hands in public places... because you will be arrested (!), by whom?By Mr. X? Seems like no. By some judge on the board? Why not just kill him?This is a part of rules of Mr. X? Oh, this is really stupid.To make everybody kill other in silent place it is enough to kill killer if he breaks this rule.Arrest, judge, jail (for 90 seconds!!) – this is realy weird.In single player this is much worse.After some checkpoint you have to kill 3 queries.You kill first and second, but failed to kill the third.You was arrested for some time.And after escape you have to kill the first query once again.But... I've already killed him before arrest, nope?Of course, this is just a game with some limitations.But it is really hard to play in a game with so weird logic.Idea is excellent. Just like the massive Hitman game.Realization: poor and boring.			"

It has elements of stealth, action and fps.In the game, you are a passenger of a cruise ship that has been taken over by Mr. X, a mysterious figure, that forces you and everyone else on board to kill others on the ship. You initially will think that your goal is to hunt and be hunted as you try and take down your target, but its basically just you taking down other targets, because of reasons explained in the story.This game lacks any heavy plot and is instead, do this and kill him basically. If you are anything like me in this game and suck at the melee combat, then the NPCs that are trying to kill you, can make it frustrating. Especially due to the lack of saving during missions. It can sometimes feel very dragged out since you basically walk anywhere. You have meters that keep track of your needs, such as, eating, drinking, sleeping, reading, talking to others, etc.Overall the game is a decent casual game that only takes a few hours to complete. It has decent graphics, decent gameplay, and an ok story. It also comes with online multiplayer which I will not be reviewing, at least not here or now. I will, however recommend that if you buy this game, it should at least be on a 25% sale.With all that being said, I rate this game a 6.5/10~bottlehead			"

												The very short's single player game but very enjoyable to play at the same time. The puzzles in the game weren't hard to figure out.the characters in game were very fun to play with. Story made sense at the then but it left you wondering in the end. It went off the source engine so gameplay was very good. it's really fun to kill people in mysterious ways. It was a very enjoyable game to beat!			"

												The voice acting is nice, but that's about it. The single player here is a short campaign that can be completed quickly, even if you don't know what you're doing. It teaches you some gameplay aspects, but you'd be better off with the multiplayer game. The MP includes a single player vs AI mode that better emulates the online experience.			"

												The game had so much potential and the reviews were so great. I hopped in a server after the promising tutorial to find it was just a death match game. The need for eating/sleeping/peeing/showering didn't have anything to do with the game I played, and I was REALLY hoping for a game where you went on with your things you needed to do while having to watch your back for that guy looking to assassinate you.I didn't enjoy the game, and after I bought the game and talked to people I didn't find one person who had played it that liked it as well. I'm so frustrated that the game wasn't what seemed to be promised imo. I was hoping for things more in the direction of Hitman, where you can go in and kill someone using distractions. Poison their soup, rig their shower to scorch them, make the statue fall over on them while they slept.Instead, the weapons remain mostly bludgeoning type weapons.I'm sure one of the problems is that I joined after the buzz of the game, the servers are slim, the choices of what to play are even less. If you want to try it out I suggest wait until there is a sale. The $9.99 price tag is way to high for a gamble in my opinion.			"

												The ship single player story was promising, you're a tourist trapped in a death cruise where Mr. X is playing a little game , everyone got a target to kill, hunt or be hunted, your goal is to survive and escape the ship, so far so good but 10min in game you'll just forget about mr.x completely.All you do in this game is linear story missions mostly just killing people to raise an enormous amount of money in order to buy your ticket out of the ship.During the game no more transmissions from Mr. X will happen but you can clearly tell who's mr x after just a few minutes, the ai is stupid you can approach a guy with an axe and he won't bother to run away, unless there's a guard or security camera watching you, which if they are you'll go to prison for a few minutes... really.Even if you get the money before the last mission you'll be forced to continue doing them, and most likely you'll get the money before last 2 missions if you don't spend it all, nothing there to spend them on anyways.

												recorded a lets play for this game at Radical XGames. I had a lot of fun playing it and had a lot of fun losing my temper when ever I failed a mission. the positives of this game are the setting as well as the story! the big things I didn't like about it though was that it didn't fully explain what to do in some missions (i.e The Dognapper Mission) and also the game doesn't tell you that you can not reveal weapons to security and also in front of cameras! one big thing that frusturated me was the gauges that show your hunger, thurst, bowel movements, ect. but all in all this was a fun game, not my favorite, but still good. 7/10			"

												The Ship: Single Player seems to be an addon to the multiplayer. The game campaign itself only lasts 1-2 hours, including endless repetition of unfairly hard missions.The gameplay is repetitive.The plot is poor. It involves the protagonist talking to several stereotypical characters and doing various tasks for them. The ending makes a poor attempt at being meaninful, but falls on its face.This was included with the full game of The Ship, which is the only reason I played it.I enjoyed Arcade Mode, with bots replacing human players, on the regular version of the game more than this.

												This game was really fun to play. There are 10 chapters, and of them, only 2 were challenging. The graphics were not the best, but it did make the game easy on your computer. I was able to run it perfectly fine, and I have a pretty bad computer overall. The game is fun if you can get a basic layout of the ship early enough so that you can collect firearms easily. Bombs, on the other hand, are somewhat hard to come by.Overall this game is pretty fun, But it's best bought with the multiplayer version as well. Its really only around 3-4 hours of gameplay if you take it somewhat slow-ish. 8/10 game, would recommend to friends			"

												This game (at least the single player portion of it) seems like something that could be good and interesting, all the fun components are in place: a ship with people who have been given motivation to hunt each other down, systems to manage your needs sims style which ensures that you can't just hunker down but have to keep yourself fed and equiped to fight off an attack. So what's wrong with it? The single player does nothing with all this, you just walk around and do quests in the ship enviroment and that's it. It's like being in an amusement park all alone except for the occasional employee in a mascott costume to point you around to the next attraction. The novelty of being able to explore and manipulate with a lot of objects will wear off quick and you're left with a game that's basically a series of fetch quests with occasional combat or assassination thrown in. And then the game ends, no real build up or conclusion. For all this, the single player portion of the game isn't really interesting beyond the first few minutes.			"

												Welcome aboard the Ship: Single Player standalone campaign! Since this is a standalone campaign, if you want multi player, you'll need the Ship. You kick off this first person action, stealth, life simulator with a masked man telling you why he's brought you aboard his ship. Everyone aboard is to murder a specific someone, and look over their shoulder, because ultimately someone will trying to kill them. Its a beautiful premise that might be used better in the multiplayer version, because the single player version forgets about it after the first chapter or so and it falls into a standard game of do this for me and report back.On these missions, you'll need to murder people all while keeping an eye out for security and cameras. Other passengers don't care if they see me shoot someone. Its cool. If you so much as have a weapon out in front of a camera, you're instantly arrested and thrown in the brig for less than a minute. Its all an easy to follow green eye and red eye. If there's a green icon, you won't get punished, if there's a red eye you will.Like in real life, you have needs. You have hunger and thirst which you can die from. If you're thirsty you can't just drink from a sink like a deer on holiday. That's why I'm pretty sure your character is an alcoholic. He needs to sit down at a table near the bar to have a martini. Water doesn't count as hydration. You'll need entertainment and to use the bathroom. Both number one and number two have different meters. Of course if you wait too long to use the facilities you'll just go on the spot increasing the need for hygiene. You can shower to get clean, or the more efficient way is just to use the sink twice. Even if you unload, all it takes is a sink. The last need is the one to sleep. Sleeping aboard a ship with people out to kill you is an interesting prospect, but since this is single player, you're the only killer on board.You play as a silent protagonist named Charlie Panther. Your only motive is to get off the ship and there's a bellboy named Jimmy that will let you escape. It'll cost you though, one hundred large. How do you get the money? By doing missions of course. The first series are strict assassinations, murders of other passengers for the bartender. You collect the wallets and purses of your victims then return to the bartender to give him his cut. You can thank him with three different gratuities. Too little and he'll get angry with you. Then from there its stealing items for a wealthy lounge about. He's also got other people either searching for or guarding these treasures, so you'll need to take them out.Anyone in black is a criminal so its okay if you kill them. You can sneak up on them from behind. If they can't see you they forget about you, even if you just shot at them. Everyone in blue works for the ship itself. They're either security, clerks or nurses. Its a rule to not attack them. Everyone else is a civilian that if you kill them when you're not told to, you restart the chapter or the mission.So how do you murder people in the game? With weapons of course. You can't just find weapons, you need to buy them. Even a fire axe on a wall or a pool cue next to a billiard table needs to get purchased for thousands of dollars. Its a way to keep the game interesting. Pool cues, fire axes and prison shivs will always be there. Other items found in dressers and cabinets will deplete. So if you take an umbrella out of a dresser and you die, that umbrella will never be there again. That's why there are weapon lockers. These rare lockers are always full of random weapons to buy. For every weapon you'll see its damage stats, but not range stats. I assume that a katana covers more distance than a scalpel.There is more than just simple melee weapons. You've got a few different types of guns like pistols, tommy guns, rifles and even a musket from the 1800s. If those are too easy for you, there are sleeping syringes and poisons that kills a victim in a minute. Those feel more like story items than actual weapons. You can also find items to help you with your daily needs. Things like colostomy bags, energy drinks and food from vending machines if you can't make it to a restaurant.You hold all these items in a limited inventory. Anything more and you'll need to store stuff in a closet. The inventory felt over sized at least for the single player game. You can only have four active weapons to equip even if you're carrying eight of them. You can even throw the weapon, which is helpful for taking out goons that have guns.With all these weapons, the enemies have weapons too, both melee and guns. Their aim with guns is laughably bad, so just keep your distance if you're faced with someone that has a gun. Then just wait for them to run out of ammo. The enemies are too dumb to drop their weapons and fight. Instead they just keep trying to fire with nothing happening. Since you need to buy weapons, you can't just loot an enemy for their gun or ammunition.There is a map that shows you where you are and where your objective is. You can even see icons where everything else is located. I'm happy there's a map, but to be honest my player location felt inaccurate. The game would say I'm in a room, when I was in a corridor.The characters that give missions are all voice acted and it enhances the game. Talking with non essential characters results in silly gibberish like the Sims.The Ship is set in a vintage era. There are wall cameras, old televisions with rabbit ears. The decor is beautiful and classic. Like a black and white movie come to life in full color. The ship is all one big four floor map with no load times. D deck has the sick bay, brig, museum and several low class quarters. The C deck has shopping and higher class quarters. The shopping felt useless at least in this stand alone single player version. The B deck has a lot of outdoor areas, restaurants and bars. As for an A deck, I can't remember anything about it.With all that said, now its time for the negatives. I can recommend this game as a comedy of errors. I can murder someone in front of staff and no one cares. Just as long as I wasn't in the red. It didn't count. I was able to assassinate a person only to have their body fall at a guard's feet and he didn't mind. The masked Mr. X has everyone killing one another, yet you get busted for having a weapon equipped. It is his ship, this is his staff. Why should they care? The only condition is that I don't kill his staff. Rolling pins and claymore swords fit in dressers. People that I had killed were later seen up walking around. Video games use assets over and over again, but I felt a bond to the civilians I had killed, like I wouldn't see them again. The thugs and goons I knew I'd see again. People would go into pools with their clothes on. There were a few graphical issues, like a staircase with no railing when the rest had one. Certain outdoor railings didn't always connect to posts. These are all nit picks, but it all made me laugh when I would have overlooked the same things in other games.The bellboy Jimmy said that I needed one hundred thousand before he'd let me escape the ship. Well I had the one hundred thousand and I still had to go through the final two out of ten chapters. Then when I had blown a lot of money on weapons and had less than one hundred thousand, he still let me off the ship when I had finished the game. Its just laughable inconsistencies like this that made the game more fun.It was a fun two hours, even if I had to do several missions over and over. While I appreciate the developers making a Single Player campaign, I'm just not sure if I was laughing with the game or at the game.Final Decision: 6/10			"

												Though there are some bugs this game was really fun to play and its easy to sink some time into it. I enjoyed the story, and the game play was pretty easy. I didn't know what I was doing going into it but it was easy to learn. I will definitly be playing more of this game.			"

												I know this is just the single-player and not the full game, but it is still so much fun!  It really introduces you to the game concepts without making you feel like you're being crushed by other pro players, which is what a straight jump to multiplayer would have been like.  But anyway, the idea of actually having needs is novel, and actually pretty fun.  Although I do wish random dudes would stop opening my bathroom stall door!  I hit him with a fire axe though, so its all good.   Good game, definitely worth the price.			"

												Welcome aboard the Ship: Single Player standalone campaign! Since this is a standalone campaign, if you want multi player, you'll need the Ship. You kick off this first person action, stealth, life simulator with a masked man telling you why he's brought you aboard his ship. Everyone aboard is to murder a specific someone, and look over their shoulder, because ultimately someone will trying to kill them. Its a beautiful premise that might be used better in the multiplayer version, because the single player version forgets about it after the first chapter or so and it falls into a standard game of do this for me and report back.On these missions, you'll need to murder people all while keeping an eye out for security and cameras. Other passengers don't care if they see me shoot someone. Its cool. If you so much as have a weapon out in front of a camera, you're instantly arrested and thrown in the brig for less than a minute. Its all an easy to follow green eye and red eye. If there's a green icon, you won't get punished, if there's a red eye you will.Like in real life, you have needs. You have hunger and thirst which you can die from. If you're thirsty you can't just drink from a sink like a deer on holiday. That's why I'm pretty sure your character is an alcoholic. He needs to sit down at a table near the bar to have a martini. Water doesn't count as hydration. You'll need entertainment and to use the bathroom. Both number one and number two have different meters. Of course if you wait too long to use the facilities you'll just go on the spot increasing the need for hygiene. You can shower to get clean, or the more efficient way is just to use the sink twice. Even if you unload, all it takes is a sink. The last need is the one to sleep. Sleeping aboard a ship with people out to kill you is an interesting prospect, but since this is single player, you're the only killer on board.You play as a silent protagonist named Charlie Panther. Your only motive is to get off the ship and there's a bellboy named Jimmy that will let you escape. It'll cost you though, one hundred large. How do you get the money? By doing missions of course. The first series are strict assassinations, murders of other passengers for the bartender. You collect the wallets and purses of your victims then return to the bartender to give him his cut. You can thank him with three different gratuities. Too little and he'll get angry with you. Then from there its stealing items for a wealthy lounge about. He's also got other people either searching for or guarding these treasures, so you'll need to take them out.Anyone in black is a criminal so its okay if you kill them. You can sneak up on them from behind. If they can't see you they forget about you, even if you just shot at them. Everyone in blue works for the ship itself. They're either security, clerks or nurses. Its a rule to not attack them. Everyone else is a civilian that if you kill them when you're not told to, you restart the chapter or the mission.So how do you murder people in the game? With weapons of course.

												(This is for the Singleplayer missions)(Played 3.6 at the time of this review)This is an interesting and fun game. I am not exactly sure what this game would be considered. It has elements of stealth, action and fps.In the game, you are a passenger of a cruise ship that has been taken over by Mr. X, a mysterious figure, that forces you and everyone else on board to kill others on the ship. You initially will think that your goal is to hunt and be hunted as you try and take down your target, but its basically just you taking down other targets, because of reasons explained in the story.This game lacks any heavy plot and is instead, do this and kill him basically. If you are anything like me in this game and suck at the melee combat, then the NPCs that are trying to kill you, can make it frustrating. Especially due to the lack of saving during missions. It can sometimes feel very dragged out since you basically walk anywhere. You have meters that keep track of your needs, such as, eating, drinking, sleeping, reading, talking to others, etc.Overall the game is a decent casual game that only takes a few hours to complete. It has decent graphics, decent gameplay, and an ok story. It also comes with online multiplayer which I will not be reviewing, at least not here or now. I will, however recommend that if you buy this game, it should at least be on a 25% sale.With all that being said, I rate this game a 6.5/10~bottlehead			"

												Cross-genre games typically take a walk on the mild side. You usually get something to the order of role-playing-game leveling up in a real-time strategy game, real-time-strategy combat in a role-playing game, or maybe a few adventure-style puzzles in a shooter. Generally, the more a developer hypes hybrid gameplay, the more predictable the game itself is likely to be.			"

												DONT BUY REMASTERED JUST BUY THIS ONE.The single player for this game gets dull but if you find you are bad at multiplayer because you cant find people it is a really good learning tool for figuring out how to get around the ship			"

												I love the concept, only played The Ship Tutorial and now still playing The Ship Single Player.*SPOILER WARNING*But I don't know why the heck did the ambassador only took one shot before he died (last assassin before going back to his room) and why did he kill me instantly after and made me do the whole mission again that a nuts.
