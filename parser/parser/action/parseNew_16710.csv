												I have no idea why this game gets such bad reviews.  I had a lot of fun with it, never expereinced any bugs, played it to the end, and was really impressed overall.  Is it a AAA-quality title?  Of course not.  Is it a very inexpensive, fun little hybrid action/adventure game with clever dialog, fun story, and good-enough gameplay.  IMO, yes!Really the only problem is that the game is only Part 1 and there will apparently not be a Part 2.			"

												Background: Picked up during the summer sale for pennies. Apparently it's an upgrade of a 2008 DS game with improved visuals and audio, part 2 was never released but you can complete the story on youtube via officially released cinematics.The Good:* Great story and plotting that mix things up* Characters and voice acting are fantastic* Self-aware quips make the characters stand-out* Fun mix of gameplay styles show depth right from the startThe Bad:* Looks dated, the pixelated cut-scenes especially* Awkward controls for interacting with characters but you get used to it* Mismatched lipsync is distracting* Combat is simplistic and weapons lack impact* Half a game that stops just as things are movingImpressions: Looks dated with low-rez cutscenes, awkward controls and mismatches mouth to voice work.. but in the first 10 minutes I was impressed by the story-telling, characters and gameplay. Reminds me of the first time i played Sam & Max.Recommended for: Noire detective fans who don't mind some run n gun n puns.Conclusion.7/10. Shines through its limitations to be memorable and a lot of fun.			"

												Being a platform-shooter/point-n-click detective game it is interesting to say the least. I picked it up for cheap during the holiday sale soley based on the fact that it kinda looked like Psychonauts and I have a soft-spot as well as a hard-on for platformers. Unfortunatly this game completely comes off as unfinished and under budget. It has the means to be an ok if not a good game but the bugged controls, fairly crappy graphics (ESPECIALLY during cutscenes), and flat out lack of quality sadly pretty much ruins it. Coulda, shoulda, and probably woulda did things differently if they could have, maybe if someone tested and polished it, maybe, who knows. Definatly worth trying if you can get it cheap (I got it for $0.74) or if you like point-n-click puzzle/detective games...			"

												A film noir homage in the vein of Pixar and Dreamworks 3D animated movies that combines platforms, action and point & click mechanics with uneven results.

												This game has definitely gotten a bad rap by it's reviewers, but I actually liked it a lot. The plot and acting is decent. The platforming parts are kind of bad, but the adventure game ones aren't, and it feels kind of Beyond Good & Evil-esque.The worst part is that the publisher decided not to release the second half of the game for PC, which means you either have to buy it for the DS (with inferior graphics and cutscenes), or watch the second halves cutscenes on youtube, where the developer uploadet them: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL963FBBF618092865 "

												Yes, this is only half a game. The 2nd act got cancelled when the original publisher has gone under. Insecticide's full release happened only for the DS.Nevertheless, the soundtrack alone is worth Insecticide's price on Steam. Not an exaggeration! You liked Grim Fandango's stylishness? - all the people responsible for that game's art direction are back for this one. The combination of crime-fighting action levels and investigation-based adventure levels simply works. On top of that add the kind of humor that could have been given birth only by the collaboration of Space Quest and Curse of Monkey Island designers.			"

												Insecticide Part 1. More like Insecticide Part 1 and never get to see Part 2. It's not the developer's fault in that regard, as Part 2 was cancelled.The first problem is that this is a flippin' Nintendo DS port. It clearly shows, as it's a combination of poorly done shooting, platforming, and point and click. There is not much for any type of help in the game (the 2nd mission took me the longest, with the final taking me the second longest due to lack of telling me what to do other than a vague sentence).The controls were awkward, the difficulty was random if it was Easy or Hard. The FMV sequences were also horribly compressed compared to in-game mission audio. The game is also only 5 missions long (4 technically since ONE IS A CUTSCENE).I'm glad I bought this when it was about 40 cents. It's not worth anything else.			"

												Regrettably, Insecticide is a Part 1 of 2 series that will likely never be able to be finished as part 2 is not available. You can do some research on your own if you want to know the whole story of why.Part one provides a hybrid gameplay style consisting of action blasting platforming with point-and-click detective work. The mix of the two elements is done well and there are several cinematics that provide a game feel very similar to Psychonauts.As a stand-alone game, it is decent. But without a part 2 to compete the story, it feels half-baked.If you do play through this one and want to find out more of the Part 2 story, the developers posted the cinematics from the sequel on YouTube:

												Insecticide is an old favorite of mine, because I like those hard-boiled flat-foots with a dose of humour.  ""Don't worry, kid, it's just an exosceleton wound."" All in a day's work in the Insecticide Division.Gameplay-wise, Insecticide isn't much to write home about: it has sequences that are third-person-shooter with platforming elements, part action adventure game where you need to investigate a crime scene (and how to get the precinct coffee machine to produce the kind of coffee that Roachie likes), and lots of cutscenes. None of that is particularly difficult. The game does show its age, what with the low-poly models and the low-res, video, but who cares?The writing and the voice acting put Insecticide far above and beyond your average shooter. The character designs and the jazzy soundtrack support the game well. So even though it's never been a triple-A title (nor any kind of A, come to think of it), I'll gladly replay it once in a while (e.g. when it comes up in a Steam sale), just to hear Chris Lizt say, ""Stop, or I'll shoot - some more!""(The only disappointment with this game is that part 2 never came out. Insecticide has no Steam achievements.)			"

												Have you ever wished your graphic adventure games had a little more action? Or that your platformers required a bit more puzzle solving? Well, Insecticide is here, kind of a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup of point-and-click and action games. Unfortunately, only one of these elements turned out well. While the investigative segments of the game are a blast from the past, the platforming and combat are clunky and frustrating.Developer Crackpot has created an engaging world for Insecticide. The game is set in an alternate future where insects have evolved past humans and become humanoids. People are still around, but they have devolved into hominids and are barely surviving in the sewers. Many crime story clichés have been written into the script, but videogames can usually get away with reusing material movies ran into the ground years ago. You've got your grumpy police chief, your stakeout mission, your conspiracy that goes all the way to the upper echelons of power… All of the dialogue is peppered with insect puns that may have you rolling your eyes at first, but they end up being endearing. The game is often funny, and there are lots of geeky references to 60s sci-fi movies and other areas of pop culture.The player controls Detective Chrys Liszt as she investigates a possible homicide at a powerful corporation. To catch the bad guys, she alternates investigating crime scenes and chasing suspects. The crime scenes feature tried-and-true point-and-click gameplay and it's done very well. These portions of the game are fun, funny, and will provide a decent challenge to adventure gamers -- in fact, the game was created by LucasArts veterans who clearly know the genre.When the action kicks in, though, the fun checks out. Chrys can only fire one shot every few seconds, so forget about intense shootouts. And while she has a decent inventory of weapons, there's no way to switch them quickly. Either the Y button can cycle through them one at a time, or you can remove your hand from the fire button and select the gun you want with the stylus. She also turns at snail speed, so trying to dodge enemy fire is fruitless.The investigation sequences are really fun. The platforming...not so much.The graphics during the action sequences are pretty drab, and it can be hard to tell where you need to go next. Even if you do know, the camera might not let you get a good look. The game is also very dark, so playing on an old-school original DS phat might give you problems.There are unforgiving tightrope-walking segments that you'll be playing many times over. Most of the time the game respawns you near the place of your demise, but there are a few sections that send you too far back and force you to repeat frustrating areas over and over again.For the most part the audio is a quality affair. The voice acting is great, and the music is fully orchestrated. The soundtrack is a mix of seedy jazz and more intense, action-packed stuff. But the music doesn't loop smoothly, so it stutters briefly as it restarts, like a DVD menu. Sound effects are often missing at key moments. At one point Chrys defeats a giant, mechanical spider boss, but the beast disappears from the screen without any noise, any explosion, nothing.THE VERDICTThis one is a real heartbreaker. I really wanted to score it higher, but the action sequences get in the way of what could have been an extremely enjoyable adventure game. Crackpot has created an engrossing world with Insecticide, so maybe a sequel will focus more on pointing and clicking than frustrating and agitating. There are a lot of places this franchise could go, with plenty of interesting characters to develop. Sometimes a game should just do one thing, and do it well.RatingDescriptionout of 10Click here for ratings guide7.5PresentationCrackpot has created an engaging world, but skimped on some of the bells and whistles like key sound effects and animations.7GraphicsNice in the investigation sequences, bland in the action sequences.7.5SoundGreat voice acting and soundtrack, but the music doesn't loop smoothly.7GameplayAwkward platforming gets in the way of fun puzzle sections.6Lasting AppealAround ten hours of gameplay, but nothing beyond that.7OVERALLGood(out of 10, not an average) "

												Insecticide is a film noir styled action and adventure game with a great atmosphere. Set in a world populated by human-sized insects, you control a young female detective trying to solve a murder, and uncover what's behind a strange series of events. I feel the game is meant for children, rather than grown-ups, but I still found it quite enjoyable.I recommend it, if you don't mind dated graphics and somewhat quirky controls, and the fact that part 2 was never done for the PC (Nintendo DS only).

												This could be a decent game, but they didn't put enough effort into it.The atmosphere reminds me of Psychonauts but Insecticide is far worse.The voice acting is good, and the controls aren't bad (although I'd like more melee attacks). There are action and point-and-click adventure levels, so there's some variety. The enemies have very high accuracy, so it's challenging.I guess these are all the good things the game has to offer.Everything else is bad. The game is not complete (Part 2 confirmed for never being released on PC. You can play the full game on Nintendo DS, but with slideshows instead of cutscenes. And without voices, of course). The hitbox of enemies isn't clear (sometimes you're in front of an enemy and you'll miss some hits), there aren't subtitles on cutscenes (even if you turned them on in the options menu).""Bad conveyance"" are another two words that help me to describe this game. You can complete it in less than 4 hours, but you'll probably spend/waste more, because in some levels the game do nothing to point you into the right direction, and a bad palette choice don't help (you'll know what I'm talking about when you reach the level ""Pier Pressure"")			"

												You can tell these people love the adventure genre enough to want to update it with action elements for the new generation. Unfortunately, the action segments of the game, while not terrible, aren't seamlessly integrated into the game which makes Insecticide feel like a mixed bag.Insecticide can't decide whether it wants to be an adventure or a platformer, so it does neither particularly well.There are certainly some positive elements in Insecticide that make it worth a look, mainly in the classic ""adventure"" half of its action-adventure gameplay. The trouble is, that’s only half of what is only half a game to begin with. Overall, I'd give it a 6/10.			"

												This game has a number of things going for it but some pretty major flaws. It is an interesting mix of point and click and shooter. The characters are well designed and likeable. The voice acting is good and I love the word play. The story as far as it goes is decent but there is no getting away from the fact that this is only half the game; just as it gets into its swing the game ends. There are a couple of frustrating bits too where I wasn’t sure what I was supposed to be doing. So as long as you manage your expectations then this game provides a few hours of enjoyable entertainment.			"

While it excels at the former, it falls a little short in the latter. That being said, the game plays very well and is very entertaining. The plot and characters are engaging and well written, but, unfortunately cut short, as this is the first half of an incomplete series.			"

But beyond that it is a pretty good game, Just wish they put out part 2. But if enough copyies are sold, they might do so. Besides, you want to see the whole story you have to find a copy of the DS version, and the differince between them and the PC is like night and day, if not for the fact that both are the same story and almost the same levels.

												While the game is not all that bad, it's not worth much more than the price I paid for it, which was  $.29.  My major beefs are two fold: (1) You will need a walkthrough or guide, and (2) if you leave before ending the episode, even though it says  ""saving"" it still only takes you back the very beginning of the episode when you start  up again. That truly sucks. The graphics are cute and some of it is witty, but frankly it's not worth the time even for free. My recommendation is to skip it.			"

												This game perplexes me. Graphics are stylized quit nicely, but lip syncing is nonexistent. Bug puns exist literally everywhere, but most of them are forced. Enemies rarely hit you, but dodge your slow-moving bullets easily. Enemy AI is near perfect at dodging, but their pathing is awful and often leads to them running back and forth. Despite enemies practically never shooting directly at you, extra health is everywhere. Bullets deal miniscule damage but kicks instantly kill. To top it all off, the second leve, which I'm assuming is a ""Puzzle"" level, asks you do to a large number of completely unprompted and largely unaided tasks. The platforming sucks too because of how badly your character controls while in the air.I ended up paying about 30 cents and I still wasn't happy with it. At least it isn't buggy.			"

												Insecticide Part 1 Review - Raymond KT The game itself is fun to play. The art is fun to watch, but graphically it's a mess. Game stutters from time to time like some flash game. There's no support for widescreen displays either. In general, this game feels like a worked up flash-based game. Mediocre, short, and not very detailed. Good atmosphere. Not impressive. The game was meant for the DS. It was obviously ported to PC, and has graphics comparable to a mobile game system, which is not very good for PC. The action gameplay is basic, the voice acting is acceptable, and the ""detective"" sequences are basic ""click everything"" with minimal actual puzzles. I ran through in a very short period of time, then uninstalled, as it has zero replayability, and rather want the time and money back. The film-noir that it clings to is all that makes it tolerable, the game fits the word ""mediocre"" quite well. I've gotten more enjoyment for less money from MANY other things. The rhyme (commercial) at the beginning was interesting. I won’t get part 2 btw.			"

												I don't know if anyone likes this game since it's bundled with Real Horror Stories and Bad Rats (in which both were pretty bad games), but I don't care about anyone's opinions, this game is pretty awesome.It's basically a mixture of very popular games such as Fallout, L.A Noire, etc., it contains a fair amount of humor, and very difficult puzzles and maps, but fun to play and figure out. This game makes you feel like your playing Spongebob: Battle of Bikini Bottom (for the Xbox), in which by the way, was a very memorable game, so you can have a nostalgic feel while playing this game. Trust me, this game is worth every single penny, in fact, it's worth 5 bucks instead of  3, it contains everything that keeps you entertained, so do not have any regrets, buy this game now.			"

												I went into pun overload in the first five minutes. Everything else is just forgettable.This game looks and feel really bad, it wouldn't be too bad for the year 2000, but this was released in 2008. I understand it's basically a DS port, but this only makes it look even worse. Was it really necessary?Graphics are clearly lacking for the Portal era, obviously they thought porting to pc means only changing the control settings. Again, it could've looked nice on a DS, but on a pc it's unforgivable. The cutscenes are pre-rendered and the quality drop is absurd, the audio level goes down and up in a second and the cutscenes are in low definition and short too.Characters are flat and the plot is typical, but I really didn't expect much from it. This clearly isn't a narrative masterpiece, but it's not meant to be. It's meant to be funny and entertaining, which it is, for the first half hour. After the first two levels everything else is boring and repeated, and the investigation parts will only bore you and frustrate you, spending 44 minutes on one level because you couldn't understand you need to examine an inventory item, then examine it again, then use it in a place, then use it again on the HINGES you didn't even see. These investigation parts are supposed to be a reference to the old sierra games but they're really just boring and tedious and break the flow of the game.TL,DR;Only buy this game on discount if you miss old titles like Sly Cooper and King's Quest.Otherwise, avoid this game.

												This game is nauseating to play. Not because the characters are all bugs, mind you, but for reasons that are hard to put your finger on. Well, I think I have it figured out:1. No AA. That's one thing. The game is full of jaggies. It is AWFUL.2. Framerate locked to 50 FPS. What is this? Seriously? What the actual f*@k.3. 1080p? Kind of... but the FOV doesn't change, so really it's just as bad as sloppily stretching 1280x1024 over your whole monitor. Looks like complete balls.4. Strange mouse movement. This is linked to the resolution thing, I think, but here's the basics: in menus, it's too fast. In gameplay, it's just kind of awkward.5. Altogether poor controls. Seriously, what is this? The controls for the third person shooter parts are clunky to say the least, and then there are the ""Detective Mode"" controls. Unlike your traditional point n' click adventure game, this crams those third person shooter controls in with very few changes. In short, it makes no sense. 6. Unrelated to performance, but it takes itself WAY too seriously.All of these issues combined make it unplayable for me. As I said, I feel slightly ill after playing for five minutes. It kind of sucks, because there are some good qualities:1. Character designs. They remind me of psychonauts, which is always a good thing.2. Voice acting. Meh, it isn't awful. Better than early Telltale stuff.I can't comment on the plot, though, because I can't play this game. And really, I don't think anyone should play it. Watch the cutscenes on Youtube or something. Because this game can be summed up in one word: sloppy. Seriously, don't even buy this for 79 cents on sale like I did.			"

												You will never find a walkthrough on how to finish this game, because nobody's really ever finished it.I haven't played this game for about a year, but I remember it running decently.Oh yea, and the window this game is played in is freakishly tiny, and that bugs me.Pun intended.

												Really nice game, in the vein of PC/PSX/PS2 platformers of the late 90's and early 00's.Gave me a bit of nostalgia for the genre. Decent voice acting, the graphics are plain in today's day and age but they have their charm.Recomended especially if you grew up on spyro, jak and daxter, ratchet and clank.Also, got it on a sale for 29 cents. Great value for the money.			"

How exciting is that?Think back to all those first kills in games you enjoy, then imagine Insecticide doing the exact opposite. Awful...absolutely awful.			"

												Insecticide Part 1 ReviewInsecticide is hard to recommed as a game worth your time, mainly because it leaves off on a cliffhanger that is never to be finished.  According to online sources the publishers were aquired by SouthPeak Games who then decided to cancel Part 2.  All that said, you might find enjoyment in Insecticide if you are a more casual gamer, or are just curious as to what it is.  Gameplay consists of stages that are split up into action and ""detective"" parts.The action ones control like a standard third-person shooter.  You start off with a simple gun and then get stronger guns later in the game.  Unfortunately there are areas where you have to platform, and these controls simply don't work well here, not to mention there are times you can't tell if what you're trying to jump on is actually where you have to go or not, or you might slip off and die.  The enemies use the same model over and over again, occasionally get stuck in walls or do a glitchy bullet-dodging dance within two square feet.  The only source of replay value here is the collectables that are Soda Bombs which are littered throughout the environments.  You can try getting all if you want but be prepared for frustration if you decide to do this as any time you die all the Soda Bombs reset to their original locations, as well as any enemies you killed.  There are also wires you will have to cross which may or may not work.  I died more than once trying to get on the wires only to fall and die because I wasn't in pixel-perfect position.The detective parts are easily the worst parts of the game.  The only reason I beat these parts is because I had a walkthrough kept open in another tab, and that's honestly how I recommed you play these parts as well.  You essentially have to talk to other characters to get clues, get a few items, use items in specific parts and then move onto the next board.  Maybe I'm just bad at puzzles and such, but the logic didn't quite seem to click with me here.  The game will give vague instuctions but you'll be dozing off from boredom at that point.  Once again there are parts where you have to stand pixel-perfect for certain things to work.  It's kind of a shame that these parts are so story-driven yet the story doesn't get a proper ending.My last complaints about this game are trivial but I want to mention them anyway.  While the voice acting is decent, you will be hearing a lot of the same lines over and over again.  The lines that you do want to hear will likely be drowned in the sound of other explosions and gunshots going off, or your own character having to say her own line, thereby cutting off the soundclip that you needed to hear.  Also the enemies that hide under the manholes in the final stage can only be killed by hista-mines, not that the game ever tells you (or if it does I didn't notice).  Although I know it's a ""Part 1,"" it's still too short.  The final boss simply didn't feel like a final boss and instuctions were vague on how to kill it (lure the spiderbot to the railroad and shoot it with the ambergun right before the train comes).  And of course, the game has no ending.  I honestly wanted to see where the story led, who the ultimate bad guys were.I still give Insecticide Part 1 a thumbs up as there is stuff to like here.  It is a very quirky game and self-aware.  There are plenty of bug puns from start to finish both in the dialoge and the environments you play through.  Casual gamers will probably like it more than the hardcore crowd.  There is also a Nintendo DS version of Insecticide but it seems to be pretty much the same game.  I would say if you're curious, then give it a go.  However if you decide to pass it up, you're not missing much.			"

												""Part 1 of 2"" says the title screen, but sadly there is not part 2. Part 1, however, is a hybrid between shooter, platformer, and adventure game. The AI is a bit wonky and instantly dodges your shots and the adventure sections are very unclear about what the heck to do, but otherwise, this game is very enjoyable and has a Tim Schafer-esque art style. Just don't get your hopes too high for a satisfying story, because it leaves you at an unsatisfying cliffhanger with no plans on a follow-up.			"

												I love this game. But this game makes it hard to love this game. I purchased this game at a discounted price, and I would do it again. I desperately want somebody to remake this game, just fix the mechanics. However, I still love it. ALRIGHT.Pros: -The voice acting is absolutely amazing, I can't get enough of it.-I really love the story, it's one of those detective sitcom types.-The puns are fantastic. It's a very comical game and they do it well.-Graphics really aren't that bad. I like the character design.-Levels do not feel repetative, or badly designed.Cons: -The ♥♥♥♥ing jumping.-Awkward controls to interact with characters/items, but you get used to it.-Movement and firing feel is just not what you'd like. -The ♥♥♥♥ING jumping.-They don't put enough save points at places that get hectic, making this game sooo hard sometimes lol-Truthfully, with all that is going on, you never remember to try and get the soda bombs, lol.Overall, I REALLY want someone to remake this game, I would buy the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it. But I still recommend buying it. The story and all that is very much worth it.			"

Most fun I've had in a long time, and I finished it in one five hour sitting. Couldn't put it down. It takes a classic detective setting, and throws it into a completely unique world of bugs. I loved the protagonist straight off the bat, all the characters had their own quirky charm, the voice acting is fantastic, the lines were witty and made me chuckle often, and there was something kinda charming about the older graphics too.Do I recommend this game? Oh fudge yes.			"

												To be clear, I bought the game to see the female protagonist in action. She's a bug but I like her style being a female lead in a Noir-type setting. It's quite unique. Despite all the negatives I am listing below, I still don't regret getting the game while it was on sale.The game does have some issues for me though so here we go:1) Screen resolutions. It has oddball resolutions and none fit my screen. Best to play it on windowed mode if you're out of luck in their limited selection.2) Setting mouse sensitivity all the way down will actually disable your mouse.3) You need to save the changes before changing tabs in the optons menu. O.o;4) No tutorial I think. 5) You have a double jump. I wish I knew that before the first platform leap (which you can't do without double jumping).6) I feel that the ammo recharge is pretty slow.7) You can just double jump from behind cover to pop the AI enemies hiding behind cover while in mid-air.

												I can't help but like this game. Despite being brutally cheesy with its constant puns. Despite having bad/floaty controls. Despite being just a few hours long.....I enjoyed myself.The game alternates a few times between a 3rd person shooter and a detective point and click style. I think it worked well. The graphics looked fine, sharp and scaled surprisingly well to my 1440p display. The cut scene graphics and sound were of terrible quality though. I could see the video being bad but even the audio was noticeable worse. Pros+Easy (health and ammo are everywhere)+Decent graphics+Decent sound+Voice acting was better than expected+Point and click + 3rd person shooter gameplay+Bought it for 29 cents.+Stable. Never crashed+Smooth fps. It ran at either 33fps or 47fps. Although it always seemed smooth. Cons-Very short. I took my time and even then it was only about 3-4 hours max-Can't customize the control layout-Very short distance falls kill you instantly. -Conversation in game is chatty. Luckily you can skip dialog if needed.Bottom lineI paid 29 cents for this game…what else needs to be said?! It has a charm to it that made me enjoy it more than I thought I would. Only buy it for under $1. Not worth it otherwise. 7/10 Good. Above average			"

												I'd say this game is kind of mediocre. Its gameplay is split up in 2 parts: jump'n'run'n'shoot á la Ratchet and Clank and ""investigation mode"", which rather plays like a point and click adventure game. It feels more like a console game than a PC game as you not often require the mouse, just while interacting with a scene during investigation mode and in the menus,  furthermore the cutscenes (which seem kind of compressed along with its audio) and the overall graphics seem pretty outdated, considering the game came out in 2008.But now let's get more into detail:The combat/jump'n'run sequences is/are okayish. Every weapon is kind of viable, even the weakest one is still usable against the toughest ones, and also every weapon is usable against every weapon, and there isn't much tactics involved. You can dodge bullets, but some parts make it impossible to do so, as some corridors are too narrow to strafe. Fall damage is kind of an odd deal, as you either are fine or die, making you restart from a checkpoint (which feels kind of weird, as it just quickly fades to black and then fades into the last saved position, however sometimes the checkpoints are placed rather inconvenient, since some are around enemies, and while you figure out where you are now after respawning you propably will take a hit or two.The investigation parts play alot like point'n'click adventure games. You walk around, press spacebar when you are near an interactive scene and take items or use items from your inventory on other items. The first and second one are kind of tough, as the rooms are pretty big, and you don't get much hints on what to do, also items that have no more use doesn't always dissapear from your inventory, making the parts even more tedious to solve with. The third one (and last one) is incredibly easy on the other hand.Overall the game is, as said, mediocre. It isn't that bad, but also not a masterpiece. The price is kind of justified, considering the quality and the length of the game. However this game is only part 1 of 2 parts, however part 2 will propably never come out as a game (although all remaining cutscenes are on youtube I heard), so it should be kept in mind that this isn't a 'full game' as in a game that has a clear ending. So I reccommend it rather to those who like odd jewels (if you want to call it that) than to those who actually want to buy it and hope to get a good game in the traditional sense.			"

												I liked this game mostly, but it doesn't matter since there is no part 2 and never will be so don't bother buying it.			"

												Entertaining game, rough around the edges but considering it was less than a buck you can't go wrong. ""I'm 1/5th praying mantis, you know how we are, sometimes we lose our head.""			"

												The game features some really flat third-person platforming and shooting that never feels good or fun. It also has a point-and-click style ""detective mode"" that never really delivers on what you would want with that genre of games. The only thing this game has going for it is the voice acting and characters.			"

												This is one of those silly rediculous games that are a good means to make your mind go blank. Don't try to understand it or you might damage your brain. It's about a world inhabited with anthropomorphic insects and you are supposed to fight crime.			"
