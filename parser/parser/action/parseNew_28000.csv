												I do not understand the bad reviews on this game at all.The game is slick and focus' on telling a story about two murdering, arms dealer scumbags in shanghai. Focusing on a single gameplay element which is cover based/run and gun third person shooting.The cover system works like any other game as far as I could tell press a button to snap to cover, press the button or movement, the default button is C which is annoying you can change it in the config.The shaky camera didn't both me, mosts of the time I liked it, if you don't you can also turn 'steadycam' on.The story is dark and brutal, the proganists are prposely unlike scumbags and it's brillant because even when you die you're thinking the worlds probably better off without these guys anyway. It's one of the few games where you play the bad guy and it's fun.don't let my logged game hours fool you, I've probably replayed 20-30 timesPro's graphics are still greatstory is dark and intensegameplay is simple and funruns on almost any machine from the last 4 -5 yearsThe first game is also awesome for all the same reasonsCon'sThe final level and ending is anti climaticLots of people gave bad reviews about it largely complaining about camera and control schemes than can easily be configured from the in game menu.

												The story of Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days unfolds through forty-eight hours of hell, with a script that would look deep into a film of high quality. The two characters find themselves in very difficult situations and once again have to rely on each other to survive, which is far from obvious when you were at his heels is a huge criminal organization that the law enforcement agencies in Shanghai. It is the usual ""two against all"", therefore, strengthened by a series of elements really hit the spot (the camera movement, the enemy AI), which perhaps is not surprising for the variety of situations but that bases its success on a gameplay solid and engaging. In this sense, the multiplayer mode serve as effective boundary while not stealing the show at the story mode, and complete the picture of an experience perhaps not very durable but certainly intense.

												  Finishing Kane & Lych 2 feels like when you wake up from a horrible nightmare. You'll feel tired, with a headache, disoriented, trying to understand what just happened, trying to make some sense out of it.   It took me a while to realize that despite all the flaws that the game has concerning the shooting and cover mechanics, it succeeds in delivering a nauseating and nightmarish experience.   The dark, dirty and repulsive places that you visit, the amateur camcorder camera style, the convoluted storyline and characters and the unexpected and inconclusive cliffhanger ending all work together to make playing this game a nauseating and repulsive endeavour.   Most ""critics"" failed to understand that Kane & Lynch 2 is an ugly and disgusting game because it was designed to look like that. This is a game for those of us who ""just want to watch the world burn"".			"

												Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days is by far the hardest review I had to do. Not because it proved difficult to analyse or form an opinion of, but because it teases me with something that could have been great - yet is not. I don't like destroying a game I have a thing for, even though it's just on paper in the shape of a review, but there's no going around it. The franchise screams for a more flexible versatile game but instead I'm left with a repetitive hallway shooter.Adam 'Kane', as ex-mercenary, and James 'Lynch', as felon convicted of manslaughter, form a crime duo to arrange an arms deal in Shanghai. However, sh¡t hits the fan and Kane accidentally shoots the informant's girlfriend. Unfortunately she turns out to have been the daughter of some thé mobster in Shanghai all of China, whom is not fond of his daughter dying from a bullet Kane fired. The game follows our protagonists through Shanghai as this crime lord throws in everything at his disposal as a means of revenge, which is a lot. From local thug to police officer, a few military companies to several special forces, this guy has them all in his pocket and intends to use every man to kill Kane and Lynch.There really is nothing wrong with the writing, and reading about Kane & Lynch (either of the two parts) will want to make you play the games. The protagonist duo have a background together (as portrayed in Kane & Lynch: Dead Men) which - coupled with their voice actors - look like cold hard m☮therfµckers. There's no other way to describe them. This is actually necessary to make their survival credible as far as the setting is concerned, and it does add up.Though what doesn't add up is everything around it, with the partial exception of screenwriting: since the fundamentals of Dog Days is its hallway shooter mechanic, there isn't much freedom for screenwriting to begin with. The scenarios are heavily constrained to these mechanics and it doesn't take long for an observant player to notice that the intended storyline doesn't carry over as strong as it could have with different mechanics. The attempt is very admirable however, as even though some scenes are incredibly violent, they never feel forced or out of place.The graphical quality is above average, though the used shaders and camera movement prove to be rather annoying over time. The bobbing, lens flares and shaders look great when only observed, but when you are in control of the camera yourself it quickly feels as if the game consistently misinterprets movements. There are glitches involved as well, though this might have to do with the fact that Dog Days is an older game and my newer hardware might not render some things correctly.The sounds are too diverse to criticize in general. On one hand there are flat unconvincing gunshots, average ambience and mediocre soundeffects. On the other hand there's the convincing gritty voices of Kane and Lynch. While dialogue is well dosed, a great majority of the game still consists of shooting and as such there is little the dialogue of Kane and Lynch can do to make the game sound better in overall.All of these assets could be worked with if it weren't for the repetitive hallway shooter mechanics. All details aside, this game is mainly about sitting behind cover, shooting people that are also behind cover, and moving up through the predefined path. The entirety of the game is played like this while every now and then a cutscene plays. The motives behind these mechanics might have to do with the developers intending to reach maximum cinematic experience by constraining the player, but when a game starts to feel like something that can be played on an light-gun arcade cabinet - graphics aside - a lot of players are going to conclude the game is boring without ever finishing the first playthrough. And that's a shame because just the storyline, the strong characters being coupled with great voices, and the potential hidden in screenwriting makes this game a hidden gem. My conclusion is that it's definitely worth a play, Dog Days is truly different from a great majority of titles and a developer's second attempt to bring a franchise to life that is much more potent than the games are willing to show. While compelling story-wise, the gameplay itself will most likely bore you. In that regard it's funny how Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days is only three to four hours worth of playtime, because anything more would have been too much in its current form. Collectors will probably not mind putting down €10,- for this, and I would plead the same for gamers with a thing for mentionable titles. If you are on a tight budget and have no idea about what I'm trying to unveil with my review, then you wouldn't be able to appreciate the title(s) and it's best to stay away from the franchise.I'm clicking the thumbs up for this game here because as broken as it might be: I admire the story, characters and voices, three things I value. Someday I will try the first Kane & Lynch and I'm also hoping the scheduled movie isn't going to ruin the franchise even more.			"

												It's no masterpiece.  I believe we are all aware of this... But, to be honest, I didn't find it near as ""awful"" or ""worst game ever"" status as most ""reviews"" would make you believe.Let's start with one of the highlights: the scenery. Good god, this game looks the way a crime shooter game should look.  It's gray, it's shiny, it literally makes this the better-looking iteration of Shangai I've seen in a video game. The lighting in the game is very good as well. Yes, the ""filmed with a phone"" look can get tiring, but, honestly? I even got used to the running, which I believe it's what made most people sick with this particular aesthetic. Second highlight: the sound design. No epic music, no rock and roll, just a superb ambient music soundtrack that helped making me feel the desperation these two scumbags go through in this game. Highly recommended soundtrack. Overall, the art direction in this game is superb. Regarding its flaws, this is something no one will take away from it.Now, the story:It feels like Spec Ops: The Line without the twist. It servers its purpose, but nothing else. Now, the characters, we could argue all day long. No, they're not complex, and no, they're not even memorable, but I'm sure they don't want to be, either. They are both psychopats, there's no question about it. In the middle of a shootout you can listen Lynch trying not to lose control over himself, trying to count to ten, and by the end of the game, you can notice the paranoid feel over him. Now, Kane, he's no strange to being crazy. Most of the time he seems the more reasonable one, but there's a point where you can see he's not. Near the beginning of the game one random officer surrenders and asks you to please not kill him. While you consider sparing the poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥´s life, Kane just comes in and kills him, and not a single frak is given. And if there's other debatable aspect on this game, is your partner's AI. Yes, he gets in the middle of the shooting because he's a friggin bullet sponge, but he PROTECTS you. More times that I can count I see an enemy shooting me from an angle I can't reach, and he takes care of him. Sadly I can't say the same thing about the enemy's AI. They're dumb. And they're bullet sponges as well. I don't believe the shooting is THAT bad, because it even feels the way these two morons would shoot guns, but the hit detection on the enemies is crap. Sometimes you empty half a clip on the enemies, and not only a fully armored SWATlike, but enemies with a shirt and a short absorb the bullets like mofos. It's even funny that sometimes you shoot them instead of falling, it gives them a boost so they move to other place. Add to this that they spot you no matter what. By the second ""stealth"" section I ddn´t even bother and started shooting like hell.Yet, I played through it with no regrets. There are a couple of levels that I actually enjoyed A LOT. Specially the last one you play as Lynch. That whole going through the crumbling building was great. Level design is a bit ""off"" (says the one who never designed a level in his life), but some mechanics, like destroyable cover and throwing fire extinguishers that knock enemies if you hit them in the head, are great. Speaking of the latter, the ""shooting the whatever you just threw to make it explode"" could have use some more polish. It's so random and impossible sometimes that when you are able to shoot something over 3 walls, it's ridiculous.A few bugs here and there could have frustrated me, but nothing too crazy. Haven't tried the co-op yet, though, so no idea of how it plays with a buddy. I got it for like 2 bucks, but I think it can even be worth up to $7 for singleplayer only. I wasn't sad when IO cancelled its 3rd installment back then, because I enjoyed Hitman: Absolution so much and loved they were going to focus on that, but now I do feel kind of sad. With better gameplay, it would've been the anti-shooter to hold the crown until Spec Ops came out.TL;DR: Play it, at least to enjoy the wonderful art direction.			"

												Time for me to rewrite a review for Kane & Lynch 2.This game is misunderstood and negatively criticized for the wrong reasons (characters being old grown men, art style being intentionally ""annoying"", ending that is indeed empty but still fitting with the game's tone), while the real problems are, sadly, technical issues that were not addressed (poor netcode, AI at times not reacting, very basic multiplayer system etc) and might ruin the experience for the player sometimes.+ Kane & Lynch 2 is a gritty third person shooter starring ""gaming's worst scumbags"", in a good way. While the plot itself is nothing special, no other game has nailed the feeling of being in the middle of a ♥♥♥♥ed up situation, where corruption plays a big part into the chinese underworld and law enforcement. The disturbing art style, the shaky camera and the terrific Industrial Ambient soundtrack all add up to the darkest moments of those 48 hours of hell, making the game highly memorable. Certainly the best atmosphere in a crime shooter, in my opinion.+ The gameplay is a generic third-person cover shooter. What makes the gunfights enjoyable though, is the fact that guns are not always accurate, resulting in more immersive and believable shootouts. The ""down but not dead"" feature is also a nice touch.+ Multiplayer is pretty innovative and entertaining, involving heists. The strong point of this mode is the ability to betray your own teammates to try and take more money, that can be used to buy new equipment in each round.  Join this steam group to organize multiplayer matches and join them.+ Arcade mode makes the game a bit more replayable, with AI teammates instead of human players. Downside is, it is not available for the remaining 2 heist gamemodes.- Released a bit too soon: poor netcode is the worst of all issues that affects both coop and multiplayer. A few adjustments to gameplay, AI, lobby system and general fixes were also needed.- Story mode is short, lasting around 4-5 hours.- Long loading times.- Other minor flaws, like not being able to play as Kane offline, immersion-breaking hitmarkers and no facial animations during gameplay.- DLCs should have been part of the base game.Despite the lack of polish here and there, Kane & Lynch 2 is a unique experience that I enjoyed, personally. I'm sure people would have appreciated it more if developers took more time to fine-tune the game before release... which is why I think the K&L series needs to be remastered with all its issues fixed, DLCs free, better multiplayer system and online co-op for the first game in the series. What we're getting nowadays are remastered editions of games that were already bug-free to begin with. IOI and Square Enix, make it happen! "

												If Gaspar Noe made a game it would probably be this, pure sensory abuse from beginning to end. A fast nightmare of car alarms, blinking lights and a drone soundtrack that really puts you into the head of its schizophrenic title character. Its basically Spec Ops: The Line if it didnt treat you like a moron. Play it, its only about 3 hours long and is a genuinely unforgettable experience. Also features probably some of the best visual and sound design I have ever seen in a game.Theres never going to be another Triple A game that delights in alienating its audience as much as this one did.

												If you can look past bugs, textures, enemy AI, and the cover system. You'll find a game that clearly had a lot of love put into it, unfortunately, the budget given to them didn't allow for the full picture.I would definitely recommend picking this up whenever it's next on sale. If you keep in mind that this is a low budget title, you might be surprised what you find. It probably has the most unique soundtrack for a shooter you're likely to find. It really helps punctuate the main-character's mental illness and the insanity of the events that unfold over the course of the game's story.			"

												Very underrated series. I love the feeling, setting, sound and characters of Kane & Lynch. Even though the gameplay is not the greatest, it is still worth playing just for those. It is very dark, depressing and the youtube like format of the grainy camera fits perfectly. Imo it is worth buying just for the menu screen! Best menu screens ever! Some of the scenes in the game also feel very unsettling thanks to the music design. Especially a shootout early in the game where police sirens is mixed into the sound and music makes for a very nice, hopeless and unsettling feeling. I would love for Rockstar to get involved in Kane & Lynch. It would fit their style perfectly. If they can just keep the feeling but polish up the gameplay it could be truly amazing.Gameplay: 7/10Overall: 9/10			"

There's a highly crowded environment that wants to be discovered, the main characters feel both unique and real, but the story mode is extremely short and somewhat unfinished. The sound is breathtaking and the difficulty is extremely high, so...  It's definitely nice, but limited to hardcore gamers (with that being said, the original multiplayer is long time dead). As you might understand, it offers too few hours of fun, so the price/quality balance might not be that attractive until you find a sale... c(;			"

THE LOWDOWN:Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days is another third person corridor shooter with cover mechanics.  It comprises of a single 11 mission campaign based on a fictional representation of Shanghai, China. The campaign can be played solo or with another player.  There are also three online coop and pvp player-modes: Fragile Alliance: free-for-all team-based robbery missions, Undercover Cop: FA w/ a hidden infiltrator twist and Cops & Robbers: Up to 6vs6 shootout and escape or die.THE GOOD:+ A well established story in the mould of HEAT. Great if you loved the movie and want to play something akin to it.+ Take on the role of two great characters with striking personalities.+ Top-notch voice-overs which bring them to life. Compliments the action perfectly with some great dialogue.+ A very good selection of weapons provides decent variety in your play-style.  Limited to two weapons at any one time.+ Some great fast-paced action, gratifying kills and gory takedowns.+ The enemy A.I on the second hardest difficulty presents a great challenge if you are into hardcore shooters.  On the hardest difficulty it is even more of a ♥♥♥♥♥!THE BAD:- Levels are linear and undynamic in content.  Once you play it through, follow-ups will be essentially the same.- On the hardest difficulty even being in cover doesnt necessarily mean you are safe!- Flaky keyboard controls means you can leave cover unexpectedly and die.  Moreso on highest difficulty.- Multiplayer needs at least 2vs2 players for FA & UC modes and 3vs3 for C&R.  Which is extremely difficult given that MP is virtually dead except for a few random players.  Moreso as some achievements require all players to have the Doggie Bag (map) DLC.- Head-bobbing together with a bad camera angle may make you travel-sick, when running!- Experienced a few crashes in singleplayer.  - MP can suffer from lag though I think this is a memory leak and just needs a game restart.- Online modes are hampered with a terrible graphical glitch that sometimes also requires a restart.  - A problem with owners of the Doggie Bag DLC not being able to play a map was fixed in a patch.- Achievements cannot be 100%d because of one broken achievement.  'Harry Houdini' was likely broken in a botched patch after release.  Believe me I tested this substantially and was unable to trigger it!- Requires purchase of Doggie Bag DLC to get [nearly all] achievements.- You will need a very capable partner to complete the game at its highest difficulty.  Unless you are Chuck Norris. :)- I still dont know why they censored the gory details of dead bodies.... maybe a Germany thing!AND THE ORDINARY:* Levels are essentially enclosed areas with limited movement options.  * Decent cover mechanics but limited tactical gameplay mostly centred on pinning and flanking, taking the high-ground, feinting, or flushing enemies out of cover.* Level design is basic with only the location setting changing between each one.* Enemies range between law enforcement(mainly cops) and other villians.  As usual health and weaponary are the only thing that really differenciates between them.* AAA graphics that were probably great at the time.  Look a little dated now but still very good.* The campaign is certainly replayable.  I finished it solo and then completed it on the hardest difficulty with another player. Campaign will take around 15-20 hours.* Longevity is focused on multi-player which is actually great fun but difficult to get enough players at the same time.  VERDICT:Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days is a very capable third-person shooter.  It captures your interest with some very visceral gunfights.  Without doubt despite the repetitive nature of its gameplay, its replayable numerous times.  Even for someone who doesnt like MP/PvP, online sessions are very short and you dont lose anything but some time if you are defeated.  I enjoyed playing this game. You will enjoy it too if you are a fan of the film HEAT, where this game generates a similar & familiar feeling.  If you prefer open-world games then maybe avoid it.  Also if you like to achieve 100% achievements and don't use SAM.  Just be warned that the camera angle and bobbing perspective isnt for everyone.  Its just a shame that the online side of the game is virtually dead.			"

												You're running starkers through a city, your skin cut to pieces, a gun in your hand. Your buddy is also naked and bleeding from numerous wounds all over his body. This is the crazy life of Kane and Lynch, gaming's most unlikable leading men; psychos who just can't stay out of trouble. With the original game failing to be a critical success, developer IO Interactive's sequel has a lot to prove.Without spoiling the plot of this sequel too much, Kane and Lynch bodge a job, resulting in the death of someone with connections to a huge criminal organisation in Shanghai. With an army of goons out for blood what follows is an often unpleasant tale of revenge, torture, murder and the ramblings of a psycho and his mate. This time around you play as Lynch, although the slightly less unhinged, but still more or less a psycho, Kane is always at your side.Dog Days is, at its core, a fairly simplistic cover-based third-person shooter. You can now hide behind objects by pressing a button, rather than the awkward auto cover system the original game employed, and the controls feel tighter too. Environments this time around have been designed to allow for better use of these basic mechanics.With enemies dropping guns and ammo all over the place, and a plentiful supply of explosive canisters and crates, you're never short of ways to dispose of foes.The duo's fairly brief murderous adventure is unquestionably full of intense shoot-outs, but memorable moments are few and far between. The naked scene alluded to at the start doesn't deliver anything new in terms of gameplay, but the events were shocking enough to make me feel a bit uneasy. Equally, a level set inside an office block under attack from a gunship is full of things being shot to pieces, but it still somehow lacks spectacle.Dingy levels merge into one rather depressing whole, with the various Shanghai environments doing little to sell the Chinese city as a hot tourist destination.Audio work is rather impressive, with the excellent voice acting paired superbly with ambient sounds from the city. Fire fights send bullets ricocheting through your surround sound speakers, while our heroes constantly bicker with each other. The lip synching could certainly have been better, but on the whole the performances of each virtual actor make a basic story very entertaining.Sadly very little is made of main protagonist Lynch's mental state. He's almost always shouting something that only an unhinged man would, but his unique characteristics don't translate into the gameplay.A rather unsatisfactory ending to the psychotic double act's ordeal sours things somewhat. I was left expecting the pair to return to the screen after the closing credits, but there was nothing of the sort.Co-op play, via split-screen or online, adds in an element of working together, but the only differences are enhanced flanking abilities and being able to revive your buddy if he's downed by enemy fire. Split-screen is also vastly inferior to online co-op.The campaign feels a few hours short, but you do get a very decent multiplayer component, with game modes that test your skill with weapons as much as they do your morals.Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days is a visually unique title, glossing over a fairly by the numbers third-person shooter. The deranged duo's return is worth experiencing and is far more accomplished than its predecessor, but the gameplay on offer still doesn't match the quality of the characters IO has created.			"

												Extremely misunderstood game.  It was clearly made as an artistic demonstration.  Most game characters are murderous during gameplay but heroic in cutscenes conveniently ignoring the fact that they've just killed hundreds of people.  Kane and Lynch are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s through and through.  Just thoroughly dislikeable people.  And this game is about a ♥♥♥♥ed up situation that they get stuck in and try to get out of, but everything just keeps going from bad to worse.  The visuals are intentionally disgusting with glaring lens flare, harsh neon and pixellation all designed to emphasise how messy the situation is.  The combat is also not the smoothest with you easily getting knocked down on your♥♥♥♥♥all adding up to what a total♥♥♥♥♥♥storm of a mess this tale is.A revolting hot mess of parts that somehow comes together as a great experience overall.  Be prepared to be disgusted and best played co-op with a friend.			"

												Terrible, TERRIBLE game. Although graphics are nice and I salute the effort it must have taken to emulate the handy cam, this game is just half baked. The cover system is broken but above all, the aiming system is awful. You can unload clips on an enemy that is 5 feet away and spray your bullets all over without a single hit. However, the enemies have dead aim at 500 feet, killing you almost instantly and they can take 4-5 bullets in the head without dying. They can also shoot you accurately hitting 90% of their shots while blind shooting from cover. And I played on easy... You survive between 5 and 30 seconds and then restart over and over again until you get so frustrated that you just dump the stupid game. Kane & Lynch? Dead men for sure!			"

												At first I really liked this game, but the aiming is so broken beyond repair. I'm not talking about going full auto on a 10m away enemy and miss every shot (that's of course understandable). I'm talking about unloading all the shotgun shells on an enemy at a point blank range and he wasn't even scratched - I got killed instead. Tested repeatedly on the same enemy, I always consistently missed point blank shots. This is not realistic shooting anymore, this is broken shooting and it's irritating me. I had to stop playing after like the second level or so (the first level doesn't seem to suffer from this erroneous aim issue) I was looking for fun, not annoyance.For those who complained about shaky camera, there's a setting to turn this off in ""Controls"". This game has issues, but shaky camera isn't one of them.			"

												This game has received much hate from many people, but I found it to be one of my favorite games. It's dark, gritty, and violent. Your two ""protagonist"" are nothing more than murderous scum  who you somehow root for. The action in this game is fantastic and it provides you with a fast paced third-person shooter.  Playing co-op makes it that much better. However, the multiplayer is without a doubt my favorite in any game. Fragile Alliance is what a heist game needs to do. You never know if your allies are actually your allies and you must always have an eye out for everyone. It's an amazing game and I have never had any problems with it. It is incredible and one of my favorite games.			"

												I was quite surprised with this game. The story gets dark in terms of graphic violence very fast and never lets up. There are scene skips between waypoints I felt where the game was rushed and should have included transition pieces to make it flow smoother (such as a certain mission where you are trying to reunite with another group, reach the waypoint, then jumpcut to standing right next to them). Altogether the actual story portion was short and sweet, leaving a satisfactory feeling for about 4 hours of content. I did have 3 crashes in game and it was the game itself, no need to reset my computer or anything like that.I recommend playing it on easy or medium as the guns are mostly inaccurate, even when trying to fire single shots. You will often die to random headshots that cannot be controlled even when in cover on harder difficulties, so it will be mostly frustrating than tactical fun. Thankfully the camera angle can be changed on the fly, making it playable in certain environments like tight corners when the enemy has high firepower to potentially take you down fast.Online Co-OP worked very well. Me and a friend had no issues joining each other's game for the story mode. I haven't tried the multiplayer version yet because I don't like game modes that reward antisocial behavior in a team. Since it is a game, there will be somebody that betrays the group and it puts unneeded pressure in completing objectives. If you have a group of friends who aren't D-bags, then give it a go, otherwise, be cautious.After beating this on normal difficulty and expert, I'll probably never touch this game again, but I had a great and memorable reaction to the story and recommend fans of dark and semi-realistic stories to try it when on sale.

												The reason behind all these negative reviews may be the fact that this game isn't worth the price of a full game. So, now that the game is priced at 10€, I can say that it is more reasonable now. (However, it's still not worth when it is not on sale because of it's dead multiplayer and short story).It has its flaws, but if you ignore them, you will be left with a pleasing experience, especially if you play it with a friend on co-op, as there aren't any critical issues. The graphics are good (even for today's standards) and the soundtrack and the environment fit the game's dark tone perfectly. Also, the plot is okay and, even though the two main characters are ""ugly"", the developers managed to make me feel something for them, which is a great plus for the game. So, if you haven't played this game yet, ignore all the negative reviews and give it a try! With a friend, I assure you that you will have a good time playing it. (Be careful, though! The extreme difficulty can be quite challenging at times!) (Also, you can disable the shaking camera if that's a problem for you!)			"

												What makes this game so disappointingly bad is not all of its bad qualities, but all the good ideas that were executed poorly.The game's unique ""amateur Youtube video"" style is one of the most unique aesthetics choices I've seen in a while. There is a healthy dosage of shakicam, the screen has artifacting, the video lags when you are near explosions, and there are light streaks from very bright lights. Unfortunately, the problems this game has will make you forget those things. The shakicam is very disorienting, both during combat and when trying to figure out where to go (a strangely common problem in a linear cover shooter). Furthermore, the actual combat is too basic and the enemies don't really change besides what they are using. Lastly, all the automatic weapons have terrible recoil and spread, which makes the rifles and shotguns the weapons of choice.Lastly, the game is short. It took my friend and I 3 hours to complete it on Medium. It's not worth buying even on a sale.			"

												As continuing the lines of Kane & Lynch 1, the story is quite good, the controls and the hitbox have been improved but sometimes camera fells quite annoying.If you enjoied the prequel, you probably will enjoy this game too. I felt it was quite short, even more than the prequel. It took me 3.5 hours aproximately to complete the game. I played the single player campaing but it also has a coop campaing that could be interesting to look at if you are a coop lover (as I am).I enjoied it but I will problably not play this game never again so I would recommend its purchase to people who liked the prequel.For 3.5 hours of gameplay I would not recommend to purchase the game unless you get it under 5$.

												Kane & Lynch 2 is what the first game should have been. I played the first Kane & Lynch all the way to its conclusion and knew what the developers were going for, but they never really hit the high notes with their first effort. Kane & Lynch 2 is completely different in that respect as this game is raw, brutal and very violent... It still has a host of missed opportunities gameplay wise regarding controls that could have been tighter; the cover mechanic work but only just and the weapons; while most feel good, there are a few that don't really feel under powered. The game also suffers from a very short story mode that severely hampers the overall product on offer. The positives do make up for the negatives above in some respect. The story maybe short but what we have is two desperate men fighting their way out of China's criminal underbelly. From the first mission where Lynch needs to 'talk to someone’; the whole scene is turned on its head in seconds. What entails is a desperate struggle for survival for our two main men. Although the quality of dialogue varies it is still nice to hear Kane and Lynch communicate with one another. Lynch, who has deep lying mental problems, can be heard talking to himself more frequently over the course of the game. Kane tells him to pull it together has he knows what a loose cannon he can be but this fuels Lynch even more. Also, when the s**t does hit the fan, the characters sound like they are clearly fuelled by adrenaline when talking... This is a very nice touch and in some fire fights, it adds momentum to the scene. Graphically, this is where the game stands out to me! The handheld video effect is amazing and adds the grit that this story needs for player immersion. When you see naked people or shoot someone in the head, the camera goes blocky just on the 18+ parts. The brutality of the killings is better overall and I was pretty bored with other games that had gratified enemy’s heads exploding up walls. With this kind of game, this sort of graphical execution is great and differentiates it from the pack. There is other stand out moments in the game but I wanted to just mention Arcade mode and multiplayer. On PC the multiplayer is dead which is a shame has the modes on offer where great and a lot of fun to play. However, if you and your friends have this game, you can do coop through arcade mode and story mode using HAMACHI (program that lets you connect to friends over the internet but tells the game you are playing it through LAN). Arcade mode is fragile alliance which is a great and it will keep you busy for a while. It's a bank heist with 8 other players, AI or friends and you; the mission? To escape with the money but friends can turn on you at any point in the level. It’s nice being on edge all game as an alliance in one round can be forged by helping a team mate out if they are caught in a sticky situation, however; due to the nature of the levels you can sometimes shoot a heist member accidently meaning you are labelled a traitor for the rest of the round. It is a stand out feature but is lacking further development as the 7 levels can be completed in around 5 hours. The only drawback to such a feature is the guns that you unlock as you gain new ranks. In conclusion it is a package that should have been developed better as a single player game with the multiplayer additions adding weight to the product. Instead, what the game has is a under developed single player and good foundations for multiplayer. Combined it is a game that would be a good pick up from the bargain bin for under a tenner given that the online multiplayer is dead. The single player game is worth a run through twice if you like collecting achievements but a once through is suffice. I do like Kane and Lynch 2 I just wish the single player had a few more chapters and because of this, it gets a good 7/10.			"

												Better playing with a friend. The game is short, fast paced and action packed rollercoaster. The shaky camera wasn't a big deal, so I don't really understand the hate. The enemies aren't dumb, at least not to me. It's not one of the ""easy-sleazy"" short games that once you finish it, you don't look back. There are multiple ways to roast your enemies, eventually you'd want to go back and kill them again using a different strategy. And the censorship when you shoot someone's face off? Well, you can ignore it. The censorship is only for the ""cool effect"" since Kane & Lynch are captured on camera (hence the shaky camera). Anyhow, grab your friend by the p u s s y and enjoy this short adventure together.			"

YouTube™ Video: Kane and Lynch 2: Dog Days - Review 

			Views: 200		

			A mediocre cover based shooter that is made fun by shooting civilians with a friend by your side. Curator page - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/hihugames Eidos Anthology -...		

Everything about this game is so middle of the road, from the ordinary combat & weapons, to the glitchy mess that is the cover system. The story is no better either. An annoying shaky cam and some choices with censorship I am confused by. This game isn't that great, nor is it bad... its just eh. Kane and Lynch is a good time to play with a mate for a few hours and enjoy the overall clunkyness and ability to murder countless civilians and for that I am recommending the game as I feel like I got my moneys worth as I received this on discount. Pick it up cheap and with a friend as it's not worth it outside of that...			"

												I'm writing this just after finishing the main campaign and I feel compelled to do this. (2 of those hours are the online multiplayer by the way,) Yes, this is a 3-4 hour single player campaign, I DO NOT recommend this game for many reasons.1) The levels in this game are almost exactly the same, you fight through maybe 8 different maps before the game just ends abruptly with no explanation, a story closer, or even a story wrap-up. 2) The cover mechanics are utterly useless unless you can find a place that is cut off from one side or the other and hug a wall corner.3) The guns aren't varied and there isnt really much of a selection, Oh and the shotgun is the only gun worth while in the game because it is more accuate than any other gun, even at longer distances and the other weapons seem to have so much kickback that even if you aim directly at somebodys head it'll magically miss. 4) The story itself is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and it may be easy to follow, but you'll ask yourself what the actual ♥♥♥♥ as the story is completely uninspired and written poorly. The only thing that I can give this game is the camera effects/ graphics, it looks semi decent even though the player models look like plastic. Oh and the online play is semi-decent as well, but, like the single player campaign it gets very repetitive as there are only 6 maps to play on ( 9 if you choose to get the DLC) and the game modes are throwbacks from the first game apart from the undercover cop bit, also, you run completely naked and lashed through the streets in one level, and later in the campaign you shoot out of a helicopter that only lasts for about 8 minutes, and that is about the most variation you'll get from this game.

												Kane & Lynch:Unforunately, this is the first time I make a negative review about a game. After playing the BOTH games, I can only say, Kane & Lynch games sucks. The story behind every each of the games is really boring and kinda...well, corny.... The grapichs (For the year each game came out) are ok. The gameplay system sucks in both games. you get shot even when you're using cover areas and the camera is also pretty bad in my opinion. The recoil of the shoting in both games is pretty bad and even when you do hit the enemy it takes you alot of shot to kill them, even if the shot was an headshot. Also, each game is very short. This game is fun to play only if you're really bored and got nothing to do... And if after all this you still want to get this game, I recommend to buy it only on a sale.			"

												Kane and Lynch 2: Dog DaysPositives: + Decent graphics, but nothing amazing.+ Arsenal of weapons to use throughout the game, such as uzi's, shotguns and a variety of military grade assault rifles, along with pistols.+ This entire game is action, with frequent shootouts and some intense cutscenes (although these are all too rare). As a result of this non-stop combat you do feel engaged in the game.+ Various parts of the environment are destructible, and become damaged amidst the firefights Kane and Lynch are involved in. Negatives:- The story is lacklustre in comparison to Kane and Lynch: Dead Men (the original). The characters themselves feel dull and the interesting aspects of their personality are absent in this game. The story is straightforward and doesn't have any complexity to it. - The main campaign takes about 3-4 hours. It would definitely be longer on the highest difficulty but still nowhere near long enough.- While the constant shootouts in this game can be viewed positively, it also becomes so common  that it loses its charm.- The new arcade mode is boring and repetitive. If you like to unlock achievements this is a grind. You join a team of AI criminals where you execute a heist to steal cash or other valuables, then shoot your way to the escape vehicle. After you become accustomed to the different maps (which are nicely thought-out I shoud add), you just repeat them over and over to gain ranks and access to different weapons. Not fun.Overall Score: 5.0/10Kane and Lynch 2: Dog Days is ideal for an afternoon playthrough when you have nothing else to do. A short game filled with action and a story which isn't quite in-depth enough to be captivating. It features some cutscenes which will move you, but in the end falls short in many areas.Only grab it very cheap on sale like I did.			"

												If you ever wished you were a sad middle-aged balding man who shot his way through China, this is the game for you. You are not a fit muscular man with impeccable reflexes and cool gadgets. You don't have space for a thousand rounds of ammo. You cannot hang from ledges and execute cool take down moves. You barely have clothes on some levels as shielding. There is you, your buddy and some guns, and lots of Chinese people who apparently have taken it upon themselves to kill you.I watch Dexter, I've played through some disturbing games, but this game takes gritty realist discomfort to another level. I would have to stop in between levels just because the gritty realism was too much for me. Another point, though I am not Chinese, is that I was somewhat uncomfortable with the way the makers portrayed China, chinese people and treated the lives of chinese people as valueless. But thats video games for you.			"

												It's a fun run-and-gun gameplay with a melodramatic story was background, there is a few issues with the camera that may interfere with the gameplay, but If you enable the ""Steadicam"" feature, you'll find the game to be more enjoyable and actually fun to play alone or with friends.The graphics are good for the time the game was released, the voice actors do a good job by impersonating the characters, and the gameplay is solid enough for third person shooter with cover mechanics.Besides the Story, you have the Arcade mode and few diferent multiplayer modes that improve the lenght of the game, giving it a somehow replay value, the only issue i faced was the constant crashes in the campaing, but i dont really know if this is a issue with the game itself or my computer configuration.

First you've met with your friend and now both of you are canvas for a knife. Seconds ago you're going for the deal and now you in the backyard of some flat saving life of chinks girl. Dirt and constuction sites, narrow streets and backyards of Shanghai, no sun at all and rain all the time. In firefight you screaming name of your teammate just to check is he alive or not, because you're really afraid to be alone in this♥♥♥♥♥♥Most gruesome and disturbing experience i've ever had.

												Erm i played 2 hours and suddenly the credits rolled. lol? Gladly i got this game really cheap on discount. Well so whats to say about this game?The story is boring and just never catches you since the whole gameplay resolves around hiding behind various objects and spraying with your gun and hoping the enemy will die. Seriously, as much guns these guys use its a wonder they have such a horrible aim. But well you will never run out of ammo at least since there are always dozens of weapons laying around.Its always the same. You enter a room/hallway/open area and take cover behind some object and a wave of enemies approaches. When uve killed them all, move on to the next location and take cover again. Another wave of enemies and so on. Between those waves u get cutscenes which arent really great since they mostly consist of a shaky camera and somebody getting killed. And between those ""real"" cutscenes u get some short cutscene showing kane&lynch opening a door or climing a wall to get to the next shooting range area.Yeah, this game is probably an advanced shooting range simulator. That could sum it up well. Otherwise its quite boring and repeating itself til suddenly the credits roll. This title is really a shame for Square Enix. They can do way better. Still, i bought it cuz i got the First Kane&Lynch but i dont think u need to buy this game because its really much worse than the first one. Storywise u wont miss  anything since the story is probably as entertaining as vacuum cleaning.If u have a ""running around naked"" fetish (perhaps involving blood too) then this game is definitly for you. Otherwise....well you wont miss anything.			"

												TL;DR♥♥♥♥♥♥story. Sickening camera bob. No blood - censored faces when headshot. Useless allies. Useless cover. Limited mobility (and therefore view/protection) when in cover. Useless graphics settings. Dead multi-player.Story is worse than the first one and it takes about as long to beat. Screen shakes enough to give anyone motion sickness whenever you're moving (and sometimes when you're just trying to shoot from cover). There's no blood, just blurred out faces. You can't switch your allies' weapons manually like you could in the first one, so a lot of the time they just have a pistol or SMG when you're fighting guys with rifles. However, they do have ammo (though they don't seem to shoot a lot and, when they do, they miss 95% of the time) and, when they run out, they pick up a weapon. Multi-player is dead, so the DLC is useless, but it sounds like it would be fun for probably longer than the story took to beat if people played it. Aiming is terrible, although you don't shoot the cover you were hiding behind as much as the first one, you do sometimes shoot it. There's a lot of cover that's breakable and after breaking, the AI will move to a different cover, giving you some time to shoot them. Although it seems like the AI could shoot you through most, even unbreakable, cover, so the cover is mostly useless. Moving along cover just didn't happen - most of places you could use cover was right at the end of an object, which isn't the best if you can't see the enemy from that spot. If you wanted to move along the object, you had to get out of cover and run to the other end of the object where you could use cover again. There are some graphics settings that are supposed to make the game better to look at, but nothing seems to make it look better. Pretty much just like any other third-person shooter with a short, poorly-written story.			"

												The aiming in this game is terrible, so you have to get close to kill the hords of enemies.Although you hit explosives you throw without even aiming at them.Don't trust your AI-mates. They will walk into your line of fire and can't kill enemies that walk past them to get you from behind.Getting an image of the battlefield is extreme hard:-The camera shakes all the time.-Friends, civilians and enemies look alike; (at least in the first levels)-The camera angle is sometimes so bad you can't see or shoot enemies that can shoot you.-Characters seem to scream all the time even if noting happens around them.-Ai shoots unbreakable walls right in front of them.If you think this game can't get worse, try the censored german version.When an enemy sits next to a civilian or a teammate walks into your fireline, your gun won't shoot...Although I played K&L 1, which was a ""close fail"", I couldn't bare play one more minute of this game.

												I haven't played the first game completely (only the demo), but it made me want to buy this game when it was available in a Humble Bundle.What I liked:* The environments were really good, some things like walls, boxes, signs etc. are destructible which makes it a lot more fun* The graphics are decent for when it came out* The script/story is decent - definitely wanted me to keep playing* Awesome guns - later in the game you'll be facing harder enemies who drop better weapons* Explosive canisters - you can throw them and they act as shootable grenadesWhat I disliked:* I completed the campaign in about 4 hours (on the easy difficulty), which is quite short* The ending of the campaign left me staring at the credits thinking ""was that it?"" Don't get me wrong, I'd love to know what happens next, just a strange cliffhanger. Not sure where they would take it if they made a 3rd game* The shaking of the camera when you are sprinting is ridiculous - this is probably the most frustrating thing in the game* Not really the games fault, but the multiplayer is pretty much dead. If you want the achievements you are going to need some friends to play this with* Some things are censored in the game - I can understand the naked parts but why is it censored when I shoot someone in the head?Overall I thought the game was good. It has it's postives and negatives, but I had a pleasant experience. The game is not as terrible as some people make it out to be. I don't think I would buy the game full price but if it was on sale or in a bundle, it's worth it.			"

												While the core mechanics are fairly unremarkable, with shooting and movement that feels a bit titchy and weightless, the characters, world and overall gonzo-style presentation is slick, bold and very memorable, and the game-theroretic-inspired heist multiplayer mode is genuinely innovative. Though not without flaw, with each release, IO interactive seem to be edging ever closer towards Kane & Lynch's transition from cult favourites into genuine mainstream success. I, for one, hope they nail it if they ever make Kane & Lynch a trilogy.Overall: 7/10 "

												This is a vastly underrated game easily worth the current price tag of about 10 bucks.Whether you will like it or not, though, might mainly depend on how you will feel about the camera perspective - a shaky hand cam following your character around. I for one came to love it. Yes, it does need a bit of getting used to, but then it provides a remarkably authentic feel of actually ""being there"". There's no other TPS with this unique atmosphere. Also, considering the game is from 2010, the graphics did age surprisingly well. (Edit: I just became aware of the fact that you actually can make the camera more ""steady"" in the options, so if you're put off by the default camera, this might let you reconsider.) The shooter mechanics we get are competent. There's situations where your char will not use the cover like you'd intend him to do, but that's an issue encountered in almost all cover shooters. Also, I can't remember any other game where the impact of enemy bullets into your cover feels equally menacing.   The story is nothing to write home about, but more important IMO is that the two lead characters are interesting and - in their special way - likeable. I find they are much better than those we got with GTA V. The story mode is not very long, but quite replayable because the Shanghai settings are fun. If you're even remotely interested in third person shooters, you should absolutely get this.			"

												Although Kane and Lynch 2: Dog Days from IO Interactive has a distinct visual style, the other parts of the game never branch out in any interesting or different ways, and made worse by the shockingly brief 3-5 hour single-player campaign.The best part of Dog Days is the visual style. The game is shot like you are looking through a handheld camera. Although you can turn on steady cam for anyone prone to motion sickness, the rest of the effects cannot be turned off. This is a welcome change. Most games allow you to turn off their effects, I appreciated that Dog Days had a vision and stuck too it with this game.While the visual style is distinct, unfortunately the other parts of the game are not. It's a standard cover based third person shooter, the story did enough to keep me wanting to see how it played out, despite the fair amount of cliches, such as Kane talking about this being his last job, or one the characters literally saying ""I'm too old for this"".The game is also incredibly short, it took me just under 4 hours to finish the single-player campaign on medium. Even though their is multiplayer, I was unable to find any ranked or player matches.Ultimately Kane and Lynch 2: Dog Days is a flawed game, the visual style is very unique, but goes to waste in a game that is not that much fun to play.

												I completed the first game yesterday and I enjoyed it a fair bit.I loved its variety, story, character building and level design.But I also hated the cover mechanics, gunplay and just overall gameplay stuff.Well, this time around, this game did it all kind of opposite.I'll start off with mentioning that the style of graphics/filters that this game has is pretty damn awesome. It looks like a documentary that had been filmed about the adventure of our protagonists. There are even things like rendering bugs, timers and best of all: censoring. Yup. When you see Lynch's flobby♥♥♥♥♥♥ you'll be spared the details. Same goes with a mob boss's daughter's ♥♥♥♥♥. The shooting is great and feels very responsive. All gunsounds also sound amazing. Although later on in the game, enemies become slightly bulletspongey, which I don't approve. An early game enemy can take 2-3 bullets max. While at the same time, a late game enemy will most likely take 5-8 bodyshots or 1-3 headshots. The sound design is... fitting. I personally didn't like the idea of excluding music and adding some weird noises to be played every few minutes, but at the same time, the lack of music introduces loud gunshots that were truly powerful thanks to the lack of tunes. I would've preferred a lack of music in the key points of the game, but that's mostly a personal preference and what they did was still executed well.The story is less interesting than the first K&L, but this story will instead make you care about the characters a bit more and maybe have you even root for them. The ending, while hated by most, felt ok to me. It was pretty abrupt, but looking at the game's tone, it made sense. Same went with transitioning between levels and the upright skipping of filler content, like pointless running. It made sense in this documentary format and I'm fine with it ending like it did. I would've preferred a quick 2 minute cutscene of what happened next, but it doesn't really matter. The characters are pretty boring now compared to the predecessor, but since they were built up, there was no reason to just keep adding stuff there.The length of the game has been its criticism. But... why? This game was short, but sweet. It never really had a dull moment, except for the last mission. If you want a long game, then just play Minecraft and WoW and stay there. Those are people that don't understand the idea of quality hours vs. random game hours. The tone that this game has is gritty... really gritty. There is death and violence, sure, but the way that it's presented is what really impacted me. It does the gritty stuff without ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dialogue, without bad graphic filters or anything like that. At one point in the game, it even felt more like a horror game than anything, even though I was shooting at enemies and there were no scares there. What scared me was the idea of all of that happening and looking realistic enough to be considered plausible. The spectacle that the game offers in the game is really damn great. It's like an indie action flick that knows its audience. There are no moments of downtime really and that's just perfect. Seeing random character development is not what this game should focus on and they understood that.And for my last point: Variety. It's... I mean... Hmm.. It's weird to talk about this one. There's variety, but it's nothing compared to the first game. You're mostly running around on the streets of Shanghai or in the buildings of Shanghai, but the variety comes in in the locations you're in. There's never a point, where something feels familiar or similar to something before. So, while it doesn't excel in this, it doesn't really fail at it either.Overall:Objective grade: 6/10 Above averageSubjective grade: 8/10 A truly great game(All games start at a 5/10 and move upwards/downwards based on the pros and cons presented in the review)P.S. All of this is from single-player. I didn't play in co-op. We all know co-op is better, so take that into consideration.			"

												It's a fun, action packed game that has a short but compeling story if you pay attention to it.I finished the game in one go with a friend over co-op, the campaign lasts about 4 hours.The arcade mode is fun and gives the game an hour more if you want to get more time out of the game. On the multiplayer side it sounds and looks great, but there are no servers or players that you can find. During the co-op campaign I've experienced shaky player animations that weren't a problem, but brought a few laughs here and there. For those that have problems with the shaky camera and the grain effect, you can turn that off in the options menu. To summarize it's a medicore game with a few problems here and there, but it pulls through with its fun action packed gameplay, and story. I rate this game 6 out of 10.			"

												Everynight as soon as I am able to achieve the sweet bliss of sleep, this game pops up into my dreams a forces me awake with the sheer shock of terrible gameplay it gives me. Every time I close my eyes, the visions of the this game haunts me to the point of no return. The visceral impact of this awful game on my life has been a blatant curse upon the time and effort I have spent playing it. There is almost no compensation that could equalize the very disturbed soul that I now carry afflicted by this game. There is no tranquility within me, and it is with great warning that I deem this game as a form of visual terrorism on the gaming community. If you buy this game, and do not heed my warnings I only ask that when your soul is as perturbed as mine that you will know the very essence of my words. This embodiment of mind imploding of disruption is only the matter of true evil, and may God have mercy on your soul.			"

												This game could have been much better.First of all, let me highlight positive sides of the game (potential spoiler here). It has intensity and is pretty atmospheric. You are not playing as some badass heroes fighting for just cause. Kane and Lynch were complete bаstards in the first game, and they remain being themselves in this sequel. And even those attempts of Lynch to save his girlfriend don't change fact: he and Kane lack pretty much every good moral side that any normal person has. This makes you feel the originality of the game, as it clearly doesn't have modern popular action game cliches.But still, I can hardly recommend this game to anyone. I could barely follow the plot of the game, as it is unclear. Most of the time you are simply forced to survive in unending street gang and police gunfire. Graphically the game did not evolve even the slightest bit since ""Dead Men"", although there are solid 3 years between the releases of ""Dead Men"" and ""Dog Days""; all they did is that swaying and shaking camera, as if an amateur cameraman follows every step of those two, shooting all the action on his mobile phone (it can be disabled in the options at least). Character control is rough, it lacks smoothness; try running around in co-op with your friend and you'll see. Cover system isn't great as well: you may get shot just because you hit ""cover"" at the wrong side of the cover itself, which leaves you exposed to enemy fire, and it takes some time to jump over to the other side. Leaving cover may not be always convenient, as the ""cover"" button has multiple functions depending on the nearest environment. AI is not smart at all, especially when in cover; you can simply run to the other side and shoot the crap out of your enemy while he won't be able to do anything about it, although this can be dangerous in the end, because there are usually lots of them; so, quantity over quality.And yeah, the game is too short. I mean, you are able to complete the singleplayer within, literally, 3 hours. Same is about the co-op.The game had potential, it just needed a lot more polishing. But alas.It may be worth a shot when on a discount, though.			"

												I got this off the Humble bundle and I played around until I got really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and stopped. If you get this in a pack of games on the cheap and don't mind a 3rd person game with weird shooting - get it. Otherwise give it a pass.Pros:- The presentation is awesome- Kane and Lynch- ShanghaiCons:- The gunplay is beyond broken: hit detection is wack, recoil is over the top non-realistic (it goes all over the place even when I fire in bursts with an AK-like weapon, cmon)- The cover system is really a hit and miss: sometimes it'd get you stuck, sometimes you won't be able to get into cover and sometimes enemies somehow shoot you through a few layers of cover from an impossible angle- Enemy AI seems to hit me from across the level with an uzi / pistol, but when I shoot dead at them I get no hit markers nothing, with any weapon other than the sniper (which also doesn't work at times)- Friendly AI is complete garbage, often taking vital cover and leaving you completely vulnrable out in the open...this might be a level problem too, now that I think about it- Friendly AI's aim is...just as good as...VHS amateur porn from the 80s- On the sections where you and your Friendly AI partner are supposed to split into a two-lane style level the Friendly AI doesn't shoot the targets on its lane and they start shooting at you, and since it's a corridor where you're exposed from practically over 180C you get insta-slaughtered in no time			"

												I loved the original Kane&Lynch when I first bought it for the xbox 360. I had never bothered with the sequel since I kept hearing so many negative opinionsWhoo boy were they right.The original game had a fairly interesting story to it and the action scenes were fun. From escaping a robbing a bank to rappeling down a skyscraper, it had me feeling like I was playing the video game version of 'Heat'. This game felt like a nonstop series of hallways and alleyways. Hallways in apartments, hallways in warehouses, hallways in airports. The one thing I did enjoy about this game was the whole handicam aesthetic. Its gimmicky and I had to turn off the shakycam sprinting but otherwise I liked the muddy noises and visual artifacts. Too bad it didnt cover up all of the awful bugs in this game.			"

												Have you ever thought about taking on the Hong Kong underworld in a quest for vengeance, money and lost love? Well then this might be the game for you.This game takes everything the predecessor did and improves upon it immensely. The game play is much more responsive and fluid. The array of weaponry at your disposal really packs a punch adding to the heart pounding action you find from pretty much constant shoot outs.The story is winding and epic, with many great set pieces and extended firefights. The environments are more vivid and feel alive. The whole game takes place throughout Shanghai, from slums to sky scrapers each level feels unique and feels totally different. The characters are much more fleshed out and defined, there isn’t a huge cast of secondary characters but this game is focused almost exclusively on the main duo and their exploits in a very short period of time.I like this game and I had a good time working my way through everything. It is not the best game I have ever played but I did have a better time with it than the original. The one drawback is the sudden ending, but right up to that point everything was pretty solid. I would recommend this over the original but I still can’t recommend this at full price. Pick this up on sale, play it for a while but don’t bother completing it as you will be left with a bittersweet taste. Have fun ^_^			"

												An absolutely groundbreaking game featuring next gen graphics. It covers so many topics within the plot of the story, political conflict, love & war, and especially true friendship. Never before has a more thought provoking game forced it's way into the market. Kane & Lynch 2 asks the deep questions; ""Why is this game only 4 hours long?"", ""Did people really pay $60 for this♥♥♥♥♥♥at release?"", ""Who thought this was a good idea, can we file a class action lawsuit?"".

												Quick Summary: Kane & Lynch 2 is a superior product to the first game, not just with the improved graphics and arcade mode, but also with Steam achievements and co-op campaign play. It’s still inferior to Max Payne 3, but you should enjoy the experience. Note that the game is extremely short, and multiplayer is dead.Once again, you play one of the dysfunctional anti-heroes Kane or Lynch (which character you play switches during the campaign) and this time around you’re dealing with crime lords and corrupt officials in Shanghai. Both Kane and Lynch are bad dudes, so you’re not trying to clean up the streets, you just want to do your dirty work without being crushed by your powerful enemies. Despite the grittiness and ultra-violence in the story, the game is still censored for some reason. When you perform a headshot, the dead guy has his head pixelated. This appears to be a stylistic choice because there’s blood and gore everywhere, not to mention non-stop cursing.Just like Kane & Lynch 1, the game is played in third person and you run around blasting rival gangsters and taking cover to regenerate your health as needed. The bullets are flying everywhere, so you take cover or you’ll die. By the way, even on easy mode you die pretty fast in this game if you’re up close to the enemy. Don’t think you can just run up to everyone just because you have the difficulty set low. Just like in the first game, you can find all sorts of weapons dropped by your enemies, some good and some bad. In the multiplayer, guns you pick up have like half a clip of ammo, but in the campaign you can go through the levels picking and choosing what you want to use. Unlike the first game, you cannot request more ammo from your team mates.Pros:+Decent graphics and storyline.+The Fragile Alliance multiplayer mode is kind of fun, too bad nobody is playing online anymore. At least you can play it in Arcade mode with bots as team mates. Work together to grab cash, then turn on them so you can get it all!Cons:-Very short game. Maybe less than 5 hours for the campaign.-Nobody online to co-op with or play heists with.Overall if you got this game in the bundle with Kane & Lynch 1, give it a try because it’s better than the first game. It won’t blow you away though. "

												So... This is my review for Kane And Lynch 2 Dog Days: 61% / 100%Gameplay: Well the gameplay is smooth I should say. Typicall TPS-Action shooter, but it plays fast in terms of taking cover, getting out of cover, shooting, running with camera action following you eveywhere.That's what made the game so excited while playing.Not even mentioning the weapons (there are pistols/assault rifles/shotguns and even a minigun in later missions.)But it is afterall, repetitive while you are reaching half of the game. (7/10)Gameplay Styles: Multiplayer is probably dead. So count that one out. Offline, you can complete the story missions in 4 difficulties (Easy-Medium-Hard-Extreme) which will give you 6-12 hours of gametime assuming, you try 2 difficulties. (4/10)Graphics: The graphics are not any type of special but they are well organized for a cover-based action TPS game.I'm talking about the weather, and other obstacles in every map. (5/10)Sounds: Weapon sounds are loud and clear for each weapon catagory. Characters-Wise , you hear them talking during missions which is nice even when you shoot or take cover. (6/10)Cover System: The cover system is well done, in levels of Max Payne series if you would. If you like a fast-paced and short action tps game with cover system, this is your game. (8/10) P.S even when you are down and hit, you can actually slide and shoot until you get up and take cover again.A.I: Your Side - Well it's not exactly A.I it's just one guy who's helping you alongside the campaign.He's shooting/taking cover exactly when nessecary and sometimes he will save your♥♥♥♥♥ I got no complains against the A.I in this game. Enemy Side - The A.I in Medium Difficult where challenging. I did die multiply times in a mission even tho I'm a great shooter.. So Imagine playing in Extereme Difficulty..I see the A.I a big part of this game, that's why I'm giving this section a (8.5/10)Enjoyment: (7/10) - It is fun to play for an hour or two but gets repetetive real quick.Repetetive: (6.5/10)Frustraiton (3/10) - Except for few unnessecary deaths.. I'm good.Boredom (2/10)			"

												Short: K&L 2 is a game where you run around in a pretty city environment and shoot people while everyone around you is screaming and shouting things intensely. Long: K&L 2 is interesting. It’s one  of those games that tries to be a super-serious, hardcore, gritty, gang-war, weapon-selling, drug smuggling simulator where you’re never sure if the antagonists are heroes, or just a couple of tough guys out for themselves in a world that’s filled with horrible things.Now, we’ve all seen or played this plotline at one point or another before, but the difference between K&L 2 and say, GTA, is that in GTA I can never take the plot or the environment seriously, even though I get the feeling you’re meant to. Let’s be honest--you only do the missions in GTA because you have to, and really you’re just planning the next hooker bar you’re going to shoot up. Here’s where K&L 2 gains my respect--it maintains a more or less completely immersive experience within the environment I’ve described--it doesn’t relent in being an uncomfortable gritty world where the mire is as thick around the heroes as it is the world they live in.The environments in this game are superb--not strictly from a graphical sense, but from a design standpoint. Layouts feel natural and detailed; desks are lined with believable objects, streets are filled with restaurant tables and stacked chairs. It truly feels real, as you wander through the city streets and in cramped buildings.The problem is that in its essence, K&L 2 is merely another cover-and-shoot game. It starts off with you interrogating some guy, which quickly leads to taking cover and shooting a bunch of dudes. It then cuts to a car crash where you take cover and shoot a bunch of dudes. Kane and Lynch decide to go visit the gang boss that is harassing them in hopes of figuring out what’s going on--all the while taking cover and shooting all his dudes. You’re at a restaurant… suddenly people bust in and you take cover and shoot. Mechanically speaking, while the game isn’t horrible, it’s nothing new or particularly engaging.That’s not to say that the game is easy--staying true to its sense of immersion, it’s actually somewhat difficult. You never really feel powerful as you hide behind every piece of cover you can, and if you think you can run into a room and reliably gun everyone down like some super hero (or villain) you’ll quickly find yourself flat on your back in a puddle of your own bodily fluids. That being said, one rather unrealistic feature is that you can soak up more bullets than an elephant could, but considering the intelligent and coordinated attacks executed by your enemies, you need to in order to make the game playable while you learn your way around.Kane and Lynch are interesting characters, in spite of not really saying much about themselves. I’ll admit to having no clue about any of the previous plot concerning the duo, but the two of them have an uncanny unspoken chemistry between them--something that oddly might be described even in the short time that I saw them, as a trusting love. That being said though, very little of who they are, what they do, or what their motives are, are revealed to the player early on. I have no doubt that there would be some interesting twist, some dark reveal near the third act of the game’s story, but I haven’t played far enough to see it, and I’m not sure I’m really motivated to do so.In closing, I feel that K&L 2 would probably have made a much better under-funded TV show than a game, if they could somehow have kept the same feeling the game provided and just cut out 80% of the “running around and shooting guys” segments. Kane and Lynch are interesting characters, and I would love to see more of them… I’m just not sure that I’m willing to fight through bloodbath after bloodbath to find out. I would recommend that those who enjoy cover shooters with a gritty, uncomfortable, Pulp-Fiction-like atmosphere give it a try, but otherwise you might, like me, find yourself wishing you could just walk through the well-built streets of China, listening to conversations between Kane and Lynch instead of the sounds of bullets and the F-bomb being dropped every-other sentence.

												Bland, unoriginal, uninspired. Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days is exactly how you shouldn't do a sequel and why you shouldn't do a sequel to a bad game anyway. The worst thing about it has to be the use of the awkward Youtube filter, it blurs the visuals and makes what could of been a visually superb game into a grotesque being equivilent of Katie Price. Ultimately this Gears clone lacks any sort of a substance. Kane & Lynch 2 has a weak story, weaker characterisation and is an unrewarding experience all in all. Levels grow repetitive fast, cover doesn't actually work and online co-op is laggy even on a solid connection. Please, please, please avoid Kane & Lynch 2. IO Interactive, it's developers, are capable of more - their work on Freedom Fighters and Hitman is evidence of this. As attractive as Kane and Lynch 2 may seem, especially for it's low cost price tag, the game is worth no attention.			"

												I don't find this game to be bad, but rather the opposite. The one negative point people tend to make, is that the camera is god awful. I don't think so. I beleive that it makes the game unique and really fits in the gritty world of kane and lynch. (Also, if it bothers some people that much, a simple trip to the control settings will solve your problem).Speaking about the world. The developers really did a good job portraying Shanghais underbelly. They did good work with the story, and an absolute steller job with the setting, which really stands out to me, especially the neon lights and market stalls. The gameplay is solid, responsive and brutal. The game does get rather challenging on higher difficulties, but that is to be expected. Sadly i wasn't given the chance to play the multiplayer portion of the game, because it's practically dead. Although the arcade mode is a good distraction and serves as an offline multiplayer mode. There is also a co-oprative campaign mode, which the players will both control Kane and Lynch.The only really negative thing i can really make about this game, is that there are some minor bugs (nothing game braking), short story mode (finished it in a few houres) and finally the ending...What a bad ending. The reason why it's bad is because the game just ends. That's it. No real conclutuion to their story or anything like that. Overall, the game is good. Dispite those hiccups, the game is a fun and solid experience. If anything, download the games demo. If it interests you, buy the game only when it's on sale.			"

												The problem with Kane and Lynch is not the approach IO Interactive has to tell a story. Some notable elements people do not like about the game: shaky cam when running (you can actually turn this off), pixelation and ""elongated"" lighting effects. The last two are in line with the documentary style concept the developers had - all these serve to tell you a story in a more realistic way. To a certain degree you feel like watching a sequel to Heat. Now, how cool is that, right?The problem with Kane and Lynch is how IO Interactive could not put these pieces together very well. Instead, the game is marred by several other issues that do not let you understand what the creators tried to achieve here. Notable examples: the game is extremely short. Can be completed in a couple of hours and then you are off to coop should you be able to find anyone out there waiting for you for the same reason (it is unlikely, though). The game utilises a cover-based system in a horrible way: enemies can easily hit you once behind cover for no apparent reason. This is challenging, yes, but not in a positive way. Furthermore, each and every foe is a sharp-shooter while you can barely hit anyone with precision aiming as the controls are so bad. Even headshots do not count occasionally. And as throughout a level you are apt to eliminate dozens of criminals, cops and members of the special forces the aiming issue is an unforgivable one.It is already difficult to accept a game that follows a very violent, dark and gritty theme. IO Interactive made it even more difficult by not paying enough attention to the gameplay itself - it is simply not fun to play this game. Its predecessor was already a passable product but this is quite horrible, actually. Skip this one and pick up something else that is on sale.			"

												This is a really cool and stylized thrird-person shooter.  The game takes place from the perspective of Lynch and if you can find someone to play with you can get a very Dead Space 3 type game in which Lynch is having delusions that Kane cannot see.  Dog Days is really interesting because you are throwsn into a gang war right from the start.  The camera is really well done in a modern reality T.V. type perspective as though it is a camera person following you around.  This leads to the action feeling appropriately jarring and disorienting.  I'm really enjoying this so far and find it to be a huge improvement over the forst game.  Definitely check this out and get a friend to play with if possible.			"

												Kane & Lynch 2. I liked the first one, it had good story, nice chemistry, pretty good graphic at the time, guns were fun. Automatic reload and cover were annoying. In short, it had its problems.This one though, was very short, which is actually good thing because it has almost no chemistry between Kane and Lynch. Story is classic cliche, shaking of camera when sprinting was stupid idea. K&L kils of entire shanghai population. Some missions are fun, some sucks and are boring.Coop is very buggy, we ended up many times with bugged camera (character in middle of a screen, could not aim properly). Sometimes enemy spawns behind your eyes with a shotgun which results in a game over.5/10			"

												My review is based purely off single player mode. Do understand that this game comes with multiplayer mode as well as co-op mode which might differ from my playthrough experience.I was very excited about this game right after i finished the prequel. The excitment was because the prequel was promising, and had potential back did not deliver thus I was excited to play this sequel hoping to see improvement. Man was i disappointed.Yes its true that there are improvements on the gameplay etc, but the major turn off about this sequel is the camera. From what i read about censorship, it seems that the developer chose for a ""handheld"", ""youtube"", ""homemade"" camera art direction style. Oh my, its the first time i ever get giddy from playing a FPS.Improvements such as better aiming and hit recognition (still bad) can be seen in this sequel. The AI partner also has been improved greatly. They actually do kill the enemies unlike the previous game. Storyline is very shallow, worst still than the first. I personaly preferred the plot of the first story. Not to worry, you won't miss out much in terms of story if you decide to hope into this.I would say i'm greatly disappointed about this game. Just can't wait to faster finish it (self fullfillment of clearing backlog) and leave it in my library for good.Do not recommend it.			"

												In Kane & Lynch: Dead Men, Lynch was schizophreniac. Since he has a chinese girlfriend he doesn't need to take pills anymore. But then Kane came back in his life and ruined everything.Running naked with scars all over the body is what Co-op gaming in Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days is about. Don't mind the shaky video cam and the censorship.Start a Co-op game and crank up the game difficulty to Extreme. And see how fair the game is :- 5 seconds to revive your teammate...- Broken cover system...- Low accuracy weapons...- Inconsistent damage output...Really hard to imagine this game was made by the team who made the Hitman series...Rating:4.0			"

												Most of film directors and film studios are professional in specific genre(s). It usualy does'nt work when a famous director who makes horror films, leaves his major genre to make movies in different genre, for example comedy. It would be interesting to see their effort in different fields but just for a test. It would take so much time and effort if Rockstar want to leave open world games to develop a FPS like COD and I believe it won't be a good game, atleast not like COD.I wrote all the description above to say it dose'nt work for IO interactive too. When they developed the first Kane and Lynch, I played it and it was obvious that the game is'nt a good Third Person Shooter. I found that IO is not a good shooter developer and they should remain at stealth genre and just rule at Action/Stealth kingdom. I was never thinking that IO is going to develop a sequel for Kane and Lynch.Kayne and Lynch Dog Days is just ordinary and even bad. Like the previous game, here we face repetitive action flow in most of levels. Developers have tried to refresh the game flow by defining some action scenarios like shooting from a flying heli or scorting a car but num. of these scenes are very low and they can't help. Shooting machanic does'nt feel good again just like KL1. Enemy AI is awful and It does'nt try to challange player through the appropriate way like flanking, changing cover to get some better position or trying to get player out of his cover; they just wait for player to peek cover to start shooting him. In some of the levels, there are encounters which player faces so many enemies and because of AI system. it just turns into a frustrating battle. The only innovating element of the game is its camera which would seem very intresting, but after a few minutes, the feel of interest will be replaced with headache because of its shake and noises. Kane and Lynch characters may seem attractive at the first place. I know people who say they like Kane and Lynch serie just because of their characters. But good characters need room in a good story to act and shine. Both Kane and Lynch games have very simple and repetitive story so there's no chance for characteriztion. Honestly, I really don't know why some of gamers like Kane and Lynch characters, because except some cool visual elements, Kane is an ordinary criminal who loves his daughter and Lynch is a crazy idiot partner who always makes trouble.After all things I wrote, you better know that Kane and Lynch 2 has an online mode too with some interesting modes, and you can also play coop throuhg main campaign with another player which sounds great. But unfortunately, there are no online players most of time and unless you have some friends in this game to play with, you won't be able to try the online or coop mode.Final word, just try IO's hitmans and enjoy them because there's nothing precious in Kane and Lynch waiting for you.

												This game really isn't as bad as some people say. Once you disable the annoying effects and enable steadycam in the options menu, the game actually becomes a fairly solid 3rd person cover shooter that you can play with your friend for about five hours or so. If you can get Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days at a low price during sales, then it's worth your time. But I wouldn't recommend paying more than 2€ for it.The game is not perfect though, and it does have flaws. One complaint I have is that the enemies take a lot of bullets before they die unless you can land a perfect headshot. Also the controls can feel a bit floaty compared to other games in the genre, but this is something that you get used to after playing for a while. Besides that the game is a lot of fun when played in co-op mode. Just make sure to disable the ""Fullscreen Effects"" before you start playing.			"

												Jesus, this kotaku BIG TURD web site don't know♥♥♥♥♥♥about video games ! Kane & Lynch 1 & 2 are in my favorite games list. They are living Action-movies, with an outstanding level design, dynamic movie-style' story-telling, very immersive ""taking cover"" gameplay, and even the voices and the sounds are way better than in most games. You can replay chapters with different weapons or for achievements, you always have enough ammo or you can pick up enemy weapons if not, and when you take cover for a while, you recover slowly, which is a very good gameplay option to keep you focus on the action. (better than running under enemy fire like a crazy rabbit to pick up ammo like in ""The Heist"" or than searching for med packs)And in addition to the story you can play it in coop with a friend or even play the multiplayer mode alone with bots.In 2014, this game is still beautiful.Thanks to Square Enix & I.O. those games are as nervous and powerfull as their model HEAT.

												Sadly a short, awkward, terrible looking game.  Some interesting ideas, but quite poorly executed.  I really wanted to try and meet it halfway but ultimately felt it outstayed it's welcome even though it is also a very short campaign.  Best played on easy as the mechanics don't hold up to a satisfying playthrough on the harder settings.  Momentum is important to the scripted scenes fast pacing and I feel this breaks down when the enemies take many hits.  The guns are unbelievably inaccurate and once all the eye candy/ set dressing has been destroyed and yet you are still firing at the same enemy in cover, well it becomes rather tedious and at odds with the narrative.Really can't recommend overall.  Just not worth your time.			"

												I don't know why people dog on this so much (see what i did huh huh, no? f*ck you then) from the reviews i read beforehand and from just having played the first game this is much better than i expected, much less jank than the first one, i really enjoyed the shooting in this.This had to have influenced Max Payne 3 as well from an aesthetic perspective. For some reason which isn't explained in the game, there is an documentary style guerrilla filmmaking gimmick used in this, where when you run the camera shakes behind you violently like Paul Greengrass is the cameraman. There is also this terrible filter used throughout the game where the faraway image is compressed and when you move around or things explode you can clearly see compression artifacts...purposefully done to cement the fact that you are viewing this on a really bad £200 handheld camera. This is never even explained in game from a storytelling point of view, like seeing the police or someone watching the footage back. It's just one of the worst if not THE worst design decisions i have ever seen used in a game before. There is even this pixelation that occurs when you shoot or shotgun enemies in the face, like they do on tv when it's too graphic to censor it or they want to blur someones identity (again unexplained).Max Payne 3 had a blurry drunken effect every so often throughout the cutscenes which was a mistake but nowhere near as bad as this. One thing i noticed is that both games removed being able to use grenades which annoyed the hell out of me, i miss using grenades! you're taking my fun away.There is an option to turn off the shakycam in the game if it makes you feel nauseous, i kept it on because i was already used to it and it looked weird to me when it was turned off.Story wise i still don't understand why Kane & Lynch continue to work together, especially after what happens to them halfway through the game. After what they were put through why would Kane continue hanging out with Lynch? There was talk of them making a movie out of this property and if that ever happens i really hope the writing is 100 times better than what they used in the games.If you can get past those decisions then the actual gameplay is fun and the level of detail used in recreating Shanghai where the game is set is second to none. It really feels like you are in Shanghai and there is a nice variety of locations throughout the city, but the best ones are in the first half of the game, with more warehouse style bland stages towards the end, with a peak again at the end with a shootout at an airport. The graphics are a huge step up from the first Kane & Lynch.The game is really short though, i completed it in 3 hours (it's meant to take 4) but i did play it on the easiest setting to start with. Multiplayer seems to be dead, i couldn't get into any games, but apparently there is a bot mode where you can play against AI.I would recommend this if you can find it dirt cheap like i did and are a fan of shooter games, and cover based Gears of War style gameplay.

												'The bigger they are, the harder they fall'Kane&Lynch Dog days suffer from too many promises which only looks beautiful on paper but akward in the final execution. The shake camera feature is superb and unique, it adds a layer of engagement and un-matched feeling of tension to the gameplay, the setting is also attractive which you battle through the city of morden Shanghai againt elite police force of China(PRC) and gangsters. Unfortunately, the lack of optimization and the cover system dragged the triple A could be game down to a B rated product. If you like ganster movie and the movie 'Heat' and not obseesed into completing every game on the hardest difficulty level then this is a worthwhile experience. "

												Compared to the first Kane & Lynch game, this is better in every way.Graphics look WAY better, even though it has got lots of annoying filters.Sound is also better, this time the voices never sound ouf of place in any way. Also, the guns sounds better as well.The controls are not that very different from ""Dead Men"" but this time the player is allowed to reload whenever he or she wants to do so. That's always something.Also, the story is better this time around. Somewhat more interesting.Overall, it's a better game than ""Kane & Lynch: Dead Men"" and if you can buy this at a discounted price, you're likely to get the first game ""in the deal"". I had some fun with the game and I'm sure someone else would have that too.			"

												great game !! the story is gritty, actiony, and a very modern like sotry telling. Its a shooter for once what dosent over draaticcizes situations in the story *cough* cough* call of duty *cough* cough*. Other then the gritty story telling and actiony somewhat disturbing cutscenes the story is great!!! On the other habd if you are getting this game in hopes of an online you will not be getting that because there are no servers set up and simply no body playing which is a bummer considering the fact that the only people who really got to play the online is the people wh had it id say the first year. Overal, great, gritty, modern actiony story telling, with a great arcade mode to boost the play hours up a bit. I say this game is good and definitly worth a buy!!!			"

												Despite quite a short campaign with a fairly abrupt ending, this game is still worth playing because of its co-operative mode.The visual style is very dark and dreary, as if filmed from a low-end camcorder in the hands of a novice journalist documenting the exploits of an ex-mercenary and his unmedicated psychotic best friend, complete with light flaring, grainy image and mosaic censoring out headshots and nudity.The co-op campaign is interesting enough as-is, but the game also comes in a co-operative/backstabbery multiplayer flavor called 'Fragile Alliance' where teammates rob a cache of money and compete to try to make it out with the most cash. Everyone starts out as friends and teammates, but at any moment any player could decide to betray the alliance, to try to keep his share for himself and not split it. This fact keeps the multiplayer very dynamic and tense, and you have to keep an eye over your shoulder constantly, as any of your teammates could decide to shoot you in the back, given the opportunity. The multiplayer is, in that way, just as vicious as the campaign.The game isn't without flaws, the campaign is fairly short and ends pretty suddenly, and the story may be lacking in some departments. But it's still a solid title for people itching to play something with a friend. As opposed to the first game, this title can be played in co-op online.The gameplay is fairly standard third person cover shooter with pretty entertaining gunplay and cool effects.All in all I recommend a buy. It's 9,99€ so if you want a good co-op experience, do pick it up.			"

After playing this game you really want to relate to them in some weird way, give it a shot. Go crazy and start killing people.			"

												Kane and Lynch 2 is in some ways better and some ways worse than the previous game. This game focuses more on Lynch and has a great atmosphere and presentation once you're used to it. The art style is fantastic, with a ""user generated content"" sort of look, as though you're being followed by a guy with a handicam. It's shaky because of that, though that effect can be turned off. The weapons are more enjoyable to shoot in this game though the story isn't quite as good. Sound design remains great and multiplayer is basically an improved version of what it was in the first game except with more content.			"

												You can sum up this game in one word: Decent.But what bothers me it's that the story and the game overall had some potential, you can see that potential in the torture scenes and specially the city. The game takes place in Shanghai and even though this is from 2010, the graphics still pretty good, and that comes from the city which is pretty well built and fits the story really well. If the gameplay wasnt so repetitve and boring, i could appreciate the world more.The gameplay couldnt be more standard, you fight tons of enemies and progress to the level, but i gotta say that the cover system of this game is pretty bad. I dont know what it is, but i always seem to get shot no matter what i do. There's nothing much else to talk about, both Kane and Lynch are boring and the only time you'll care about them its in the torture scene.That ending though, you gotta see it for yourself, i thought it was kinda of funny although people seem to dislike it .I wanted to try the co-op but none of my friends wanted to buy the game and i couldnt find anyone else to play online so yeah, i cant have an opinion on that, but i'm talking about it because i heard that was pretty good.6/10, i dont recommend buying this game if the price is higher than 5 dollars.

												Kind of spoilers?Kane and Lynch 2: Dog Days.Such a pretty game. Had such potential, but the length of the campaign itself hinders what could have been a great game.I mean, Kane and Lynch.A self serving ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who cares only about what he wants and the other one is a psychopathic killer but still happens to be a bit of a softie on the inside.The story on this game revolves around mistakes. As a lot of mistakes were made by Kane and Lynch and those lead up to a ton of killings. But that's what you came here for right? Yeah. It is. You get to shoot a lot of people and basically ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥up.BUT. THE LENGTH. FFS. I wanted it to be longer.You could extend the gameplay with the arcade mode (something i wished that the first game had cause i liked Kane and Lynch: Dead men better than this game) or you could try your luck at Co-op play.They added in DLC's and oh..steam achievements so you can spend more time with the game so it won't seem so short.Pick it up on a sale and try it out, i'm keeping it installed and playing it from time to time cause it has the arcade mode.Feels like a third person version of Payday: The Heist.Overall, i really wish it were longer like i wished Kane and Lynch: Dead Men was longer.I give this one 7/10 cause even if it was short, it was a sweet ride.(I'm guessing the Chopper ending for Dead Men was canon then, eh?)

												Vastly superior to the first game, what this game lacks in plot it makes up for with its impression of constant forward progression and connectivity between levels. Unlike the first game, this time you play through as the more interesting of the two, Lynch (until the final level, for no clear reason), and it's more of a typical AAA third-person cover-shooter. The constant shaky-cam will likely make you feel ill after a while (imagine your average 'running' shaky-cam when you walk, and multiply that by 4 when you run in this game), but it's not too bad as to be unplayable. There's no team management like the first, but Dog Days give you far more interesting visuals, locations (if you like a Chinese aesthetic) and set-pieces (the standout moment of playing a full level compltely naked after being tortured). This game is by no means ground-breaking, but if you like the genre you won't find anything too offensive here.			"

												I really don't see why has this game so bad reputation. Yes, it's a bit short, and the story is rather straightforward, especially when compared to the prequel, but I still had fun playing it. It has a specific atmosphere - not every game lets you play as deranged criminal, and as story drags you from one ♥♥♥♥ed-up situation to another even ♥♥♥♥ed-upier, adrenaliín flows and for once, I didn't care for headshots or conserving ammo and just emptied mags to everything around while sprinting for the exit - I don't remember any other game feeling like this.

												Pros: One of the most intense shooters out there. The ""YouTube/documentary"" filters(and don't complain about the ""hand-held"" camera style - go to Options, turn Steadicam on. You're welcome) are well-done and a memorable approach to the gritty, realistic TPS. Both new multiplayer modes are great(Undercover Cop joins Fragile Alliance in providing a unique approach to multiplayer shooter game-play). The setting of the crime-ridden, corrupt-laden Shanghai manages to be bleak without getting boring, repetitive or off-putting. Controls, shooting and cover mechanics are responsive, open enough to not feel linear yet tight enough that it always does what you want it to. This never, ever lets up, telling the story, establishing characters and keeping it all moving with twists along the way without ever, for a single second, pausing... and yet it doesn't overpower the player; it's like The Terminator in video-game form. Challenging. Online co-op. Great graphics and atmosphere.Cons: Not only should the first one never have a sequel, but plot-wise, this does not need to exist, and completely undersells both leads; why is Kane doing another job(and don't say ""money for you-know-who"" - that's an excuse, and not even a good one), and in what *universe* could Lynch ""settle down"" like this? This is one of the shortest SP campaigns you'll ever find, and the ending is unsatisfying. Multiplayer is all but dead, the only way you'll get a match going is to find people who also want it.My recommendation: Only the biggest fans of the TPS gritty crime story will like this, and most people will never need to give this even a first look.

They can be anywhere, and you won't be able to hit them because the accuracy of your gun really sucks. So shooting a lot and having very limited ammo and having erratic NPC behavior is not fun at all. Also, the cutscenes have overly shaky cam. Why? I have no idea, I mean it's super shaky, so bad that i can't even stand to look at it. It's horrible, like you have a disease or something... who thought that was a good idea?

Kane & Lynch 2: We should have stopped at oneThe first thing I noticed with this game, was a headache. I mean, the shaky cam gave me a headache, and for the first time in my life I got to experience motion sickness. Once I figured out where they hid the option for the shaky cam (hint: it's in the controls section), I finished the main game in only 3 hours... without rushing.The main story revolves around Kane and Lynch getting together for one more job. Everything goes to hell, and you shoot your way out. That is pretty much the whole story, right there. I wish I was kidding right now.The game was short, repetitive, and for the most part, downright awful. Aiming sucked, the cover-based mechanics were sub-par, and the story was nowhere to be found. The graphics, while alright in some places, were stitched together with overused lighting effects, and what J. J. Abrams would consider to be too many lens flares. This was likely used in an attempt to hide their rushed graphics.They also do this weird thing in the game where they censor headshots... you shoot someone in the head, a big blur spot appears and breaks immersion. If you want to kill a game, this is a good place to start. Was it supposed to be artistic, like the shaky cam?I'm really not sure there is much to recommend with this game, I barely stuck with it long enough to finish it.Graphics: 6/10 (once you turn off shaky cam)Story: 2/10 (Hey, we're shooting people... that's a story, right?)Gameplay: 5/10 (it was playable, not much else)Overall: ... 3/10?

												Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days is much better than the first game. However, I still cannot recommend the game due to the extremely short story (<3 hours to complete) which makes no sense, insanely shakey camera (you need to turn on SteadyCam to remove), and the unnecessary full screen effects and filters (you can also turn this off under Video options), and no attempt whatsoever to develop the story or the characters. It appears the characters have had their personalities ""changed"" from the first game and there's very little mention of actions from the first game. It's almost like they took the characters and just put them in a whole new game without any care about the first game. The graphics and gameplay this time is much better, however there's simply not enough content in this game to keep people interested. The story is forgettable where you just run around Shanghai killing everyone for no reason and the arcade mode/multi-player is fun the first time around and then you realize it's essentially PayDay.

												Not sure why this game gets so much hate. Sure, if I had paid a lot for it, 3.5 hours of single player content is simply not enough. Pick this up in the bargain basement however, and that's 3.5 hours of highly stylised adult entertainment, that feels like playing a movie.Graphics look highly original and stylised (but only with full screen effects left on) and the gun play does feel good, once you realise that SMG and Shotguns are next to worthless and that headshots are king.The compression artefacts are overdone, as well as the shaky cam when running. In the last level this actually made me feel a little ill. However I found the cam when walking etc to be great, and it felt like a movie.If you are looking for a quick, violent adult experience that plays a little like the child of Gears of War and a Quentin Tarantino movie, this is for you. Wouldn't pay more then £5 for it though! 7/10.			"

												While the original Kane and Lynch may be remembered for its review controversy, for me, it was a title that really tried to do something fresh and unique in a lot of ways. Kane and Lynch: Dead Men had main characters that were difficult to like, but by the end of the dark and compelling story to save Kane’s family, players felt a bit of Stockholm Syndrome for the duo. The co-op, while offline only, offered a unique perspective for both players, something we rarely see in the age of co-op clone characters. The sequel has arrived and our anti-heroes are back again, this time across the world in Shanghai with Lynch’s story as the focus. But can Kane and Lynch 2: Dog Days recapture the same fresh feeling of the first game?The story of Dog Days has Kane meeting up with his old pal Lynch who promises a job with plenty of riches. Upon Kane’s arrival a simple task for the two turns sour and inadvertently starts a gang war. Soon you realize that your deal is going south as your contact is attacked in an intense highway assault and you make a desperate attempt to escape with all your lives. It wasn’t long after this I lost what was going on, the overall purpose of what the duo was doing.Despite some great voice acting and plenty of memorable lines - I had completely forgot the purpose of what I was doing midway through the title. “Why am I shooting these army guys again?” I asked my co-op partner. It had something to do with a big Chinese mob boss and not dieing, but beyond that everything is a bit of chaos. Perhaps this is what IO Interactive was going for, as the main character this time is Lynch, who’s not exactly mentally stable. There’s plenty of times Lynch voices over to himself, trying to use psychological tricks to calm his nerves - no doubt from some sort of therapy sessions.The graphical style and display are going to be the most memorable and controversial piece to this game, the shaky YouTube style camera is either going to be a complete turn off or something people really like. At moments the grainy and over saturated look of the game world makes it look eerily realistic. The neon glow of lights bouncing off reflective surfaces, the distant city line of Shanghai, and the dark alleys all can trick your eye in an almost photo realistic moment. Other times poor textures in certain areas, stiff character animation and improper lip syncing totally break the immersion.Shortly into my first mission I almost felt nauseous from the camera movement - but it passed. The shaky camera is only really bad while running and once you get used to it, it provides some useful info on enemy position and adds to the immersive effect. Thankfully if you can’t get over it you can disable it, though it’s still there to some degree. IO Interactive really wanted to have the feeling of intense and gritty shoot outs. They wanted your palms sweaty and your grip tightening on your controller through every twist and turn. To some degree, this holds true. There were times the firefights were memorable, with exploding objects and cover flying everywhere as bullets rained down on Kane and Lynch. The atmosphere is further enhanced by Asian inspired pop music blasting from in game radios and intercoms, giving it an almost John Woo movie feel in certain situations.Sadly the intensity is broken once you realize the firefights break down into duck, pop up wait for guy to peak his head out of cover, and shoot mechanic. This style of combat is rinse and repeat for most of the game with save for a few battles. Which is sad, because some of the key moments like a helicopter attack on and in an office building and a mission where you need to cover Lynch’s girlfriend in an apartment building across the street are really fun. The level after Kane and Lynch are tortured is one that will be forever burned into my retinas. I just wish there was more of these moments. Kane and Lynch 2 does make a huge improvement in terms of co-op options over it’s predecessor. Full online play and local play is supported and there’s options for matchmaking too. And while the single player is fun, like all good co-op games, playing this with a friend is much more satisfying. You can really tell that K&L 2 was designed from the ground up for co-op play; level layouts are well crafted into separate paths for cover and flanking maneuvers and there’s a nice balance of weapons to choose from for both close and long range giving players defined roles. One thing that sadly appears to be missing is some of the crazier elements of Lynch from the first game - instance where the players actually see different things. As far as we could tell they weren’t as prominent as the cops/civilians bank scene from the first game. Co-Op makes the game a bit easier as well. While in the single player game if you get shot you’ll get knocked down and have a chance to get up, a second subsequent knock down will kill you. In co-op this second knockdown is actually revivable by your co-op partner. This can help in some of the trickier situations when the game is throwing what seems like hundreds of guys your way only to be killed by the last group and having to do it all over again. While the checkpoint system seems ok, it never seems to be quite enough, and starting a co-op game will lose any single player checkpoint progress - so you’ll need to restart back at a chapter beginning. It’s these little nagging issues that constantly remind you that perhaps Kane and Lynch 2 wasn’t quite ready. I hit numerous technical bugs as well - mostly while playing as a guest co-op player over Xbox Live. Cut scenes were missing characters, character animations got stuck, audio cut out on me completely, and the game even crashed at one point. Strangely while playing solo or as the host these seemed almost non existent. If you don’t want to play Fragile Alliance online there’s a new Arcade mode where you can use all AI guys and try to get the highest score possible. This mode is surprisingly addictive, though, it does get a bit long in the tooth by the 9th or 10th round. The game will up the difficulty with every round and you can keep going until you run out of your 3 lives. So does Kane and Lynch 2 deliver that fresh feeling of the first game? Sadly I don’t think it does. While IO did a great job of fixing the cover and shooting mechanic, adding online co-op, and deepening the addictive multiplayer modes - it seems the rest of the game suffered as a result. With two characters as memorable and unique as Kane and Lynch, I was sad to see the story - which took only 5 hours to complete - a bit lacking. Don’t get me wrong, Kane and Lynch 2: Dog Days isn’t a bad game, it’s just not a great one. The Co-Op Experience: Team up online or offline through the story in co-op with a friend. Play as Kane or Lynch and work together with a revival mechanic. Online play allows 8 players to rob a bank together in a Fragile Alliance that can turn co-op into competitive. Co-Op Score: 3.5 out of 5 General Score: 3 out of 5			"

												I want to start by saying that I absolutely loved the first game. I'd heard bad things about it, but wanted to play it for myself and give it a chance to stand on its own.IMHO, this game is terrible. The story is nonsensical. It seems to try and be gritty for the sake of it. Its extremely clunky! It seems to play far worse than the first game, which to be honest also had some flaws in regards to smooth gameplay. It all feels slapped together hastily and in the most wonky way possible. I was shocked that it was made by the same team from the first game.I got it on sale a while back for around $3 I think. I beat it in one sitting, and I unlocked a slew of achievements that were just handed to the player, well because. I didn't do anything special, just obtained achievements for playing the game. I don't feel that a game should be measured based on how long it is, but I really can't honestly say my 3.7 hours was 'fun'. I finished it just for the sake of doing so, and because of how much I loved the first game.If you are curious about Kane & Lynch, play the first game. If you are interested in playing multiplayer, then 'maybe' play this one? I didn't play the multiplayer, but it does look like it offers some decent fun with interesting modes. You may also like this game if you love shakey-cam...seriously, this game is Shakey-cam and Camera Filters 2: Dog Days -_-What happened IO Interactive? What happened? :(Pros: Kane & Lynch are interesting characters overall         Some of the sound effects are decent         The voice acting is fairly good         Some of the environments are pretty awesomeCons: Terrible cover system           Really really really bad gunplay           AI so stupid, it made my head hurt! Or maybe it was-           The shakey-cam...seriously, too much shaking           Very short with a stupid ending thrown in for good measure			"

												I'm sure this would be a decent game if I could keep it up and running long enough to really enjoy it. With the small amount of game play I've got in I've had numerous crash to desktops and a few bug that stopped me in my tracks. Literally. My character is standing there getting shot while the audio from a cutscene plays in the background. No recomended. Sadly. And I had such great hopes.			"

												Ok first of all this game is a great game. I loved all the music soundtracks that were in the game which made it more enjoyable. A lot of people on youtube comments were looking for the artists and we're trying to find atleast any full song at full length just because its so nice. This game may be violent or rough in some way and I've seen how many people despised the game a lot because of its violence I agree some things shouldn't have been put in the game ""Developers"" Learn from these mistakes and there is nothing I can do this game already came out in 2010 long time ago. It has a great story to it. The graphics at it's time during 2010 were a great improvement which made it more exciting at that time and if your looking for a game to keep you going a lot Then this is the game for you. The game has an actual story and meaning when you play it through till the end. If you play Kane & Lynch: Dead Men You will see how Kane and Lynch were and how they became like this in 2. Again this game is great but should be for someone who is 18+. The game still has a nice story of what happens to Kane and Lynch. Again Games aren't developed in 1 day or 5 days. It takes years with even practice.			"

												Kane and Lynch are back in this sequel and it is improved. While the story still doesn't deliver, the game is a big improvment from its previous version. This tyme around we play as both main characters from the games. Everything was repolished and improved in this sequel. The enemy AI is not good here, however the damage you take from getting hit have increased and the game will throw tons of enemies at you all the time. Now you need to be careful not to get hit, because 4 to 5 shots from an automatic gun will take you down on normal difficulty. The graphics have increased drasticaly and the good cover system is back with even more destruction. It is obvious that the sequel has the same concept as the previous game, but this time around the overall story and feeling of the game is much darker. You will find really disturbing scenes and crazy new ideas the developers used to make a great experience.Don't worry about multiplayer, because this time around it works. However you won't find many people playing this game. But once you gather a group the multiplayer mods are really enjoyable. Such as cops and crooks.The different levels of difficulty and new achivments will make you want to come back to replay some levels you unlock. However, one of the annoying aspects of the game is the camera system. The default camera system is aweful. It will shake a lot when you run or fire the weapons, they try to make the game more realistic but it just gets extreamlly annoying not to be able to shoot your enemies because of it. Thankfully there is an option to tun off this shakey camera system, which improves the gameplay a lot. This time around the weapons have some good weight and feel good to fire. Alhtough they are not very accurate and one can't simply click the mouse button like crazy, they still feel good to use.Overall this sequel is an improvment over the first game with an even darker feel and good combat. The game is still short but fun. Good:- The mood of the game and overall feel- Improved difficulty - Voice acting and characters- Great Multiplayer (if you can find a match)Bad: - Shakey camera system, even in cutscenes- Censored head shots and nudity (with pixels)- Again the game is too short (4-5 hrs. to finish on normal in Single Player mode :/)76/100			"

												ok so, i never review games, but i have to this time :SHORT VERSION : if you loved Kane & Lynch : Dead Men, buddy don't even buy this one, you will be heavily dissapointed.TL;DR VERSION : absolutely loved the first kane and lynch, i really felt the atmosphere, the characters... i dunno, i felt a whole lot more involved i guess...anyways, this game dissapoints me : the shaky cam  Mc.boobyhead vibe i do not dig at all, the weapons shoot all over the place but not on your target, the characters are underdevelopped and even if the story is clearly not the main element of the game, shooty shooty bang bang aint enough, jerky and bugged props, some pretty baaaad voice acting and poor exposition.... the game looks unpolished, unfinished and cheap... i feel like the developers just lazily wanted to make a sequel... i am going to finish the game because the first kane and lynch holds a soecial place in my heart.but i guess if you wanna shoot stuff, you shall be served			"

												As a Dane who loved the original HitMan from Danish IO Interactive I also eventually decided to like the original Kane & Lynch Dead Men. I didn't want to buy this title at full price due to the mixed review but years after i picked up Dog Days on a discount from Steam.In my view there are two original aspects in the game - the shaky cam and the brutal nude-level. You can either love or hate it but at least it's not medicore or generic like the rest of the game. There is so much wasted potential in this unsatisfying game.You will hate the generic enemies coming at you in endless waves and if you have played the original the missed oppotunity in regards to the story will be down right insulting. Actually the story is insulting even compared to a generic shooter as the ending sets a new standard for 'worst ever'.While the original also had broken game mechanics you came to accept this as a 'factor' in the fights. In Dog Days it's even worse. At the end of the day I'm sad to say the game is not worth your time.			"

												I've finished this game back on Xbox 360 way back in the day, it may be short; can be finished in about 4/5 hours but it's (to me anyway) worth the sale price ($2.49) on Steam. Something you can finish over the weekend or after a long week. My only real complaint is some weapons don't have very good accuracy, but that shouldn't stop you from giving this a go. Especially at a sale price. I recommend this game. ★★★½			"

												This game... Just... Eh. I don't know if it's because I never played the first one and I'm missing a lot of backstory or what. But to put it bluntly, this game sucked terribly. The Arcade mode is okay, I can say that.Story mode of this game was just terrible, awful, atrocious. Aside from the fact it was extremely short (3.5-4 hours) there were no real quality elements to draw you in. It was more like an arcade mode with some attempt at a story. None of the story brought you in or got you engrossed in the characters or what was happening. Mostly, it was just a run-and-gun game.I was honestly surprised when after just four hours into the game the credit were rolling.Overall, this game is disappointing and not worth it at all. If you want to play a game like this, but better and with a good story I'd recommend getting Sleeping Dogs.			"

												A nauseating experience even with the horrendous camera effects disabled. Most firefights are orchestrated behind cover, turning the game into a cakewalk even on the hardest difficulty coupled with truly putrid graphics and engine glitches that turn even a modest playthrough into a bug-ridden train-wreck.The gunplay is awful, with most weapons having the realistic accuracy of an episode of Operation Repo with a multiplayer element that is actually worse then the first game.And that's just the gameplay. Kane and Lynch are a couple of morally bankrupt ♥♥♥♥♥♥s and the story is a♥♥♥♥♥♥show from start to finish with no rhyme or reason to the chaos and sensless logic of our main leads.The only redeeming qualities are the COOP (preferably while done drunk) and the (praise the lord) laughably short lengh. There is nothing fun about this game! The entire experience went by like the worst day at school and my only regret is that I should have spent the paultry sale price on a decent BLT.Spend your money elsewhere, hell, spend it on Hitman Absolution. You can rightfully execute both Kane and Lynch who make a cameo a couple times in the main game. That's a great selling-point in my book.			"

												Rating 6.5/10 Recommend at discountOverview: Third Person ShooterThe Good:+ The only thing that I can say is good is Arcade mode. A mode in which you and 7 npc's rob a location and then proceed to the extraction point fighting off police. The cool thing is you can kill your own partners and collect their money at the expense of everybody turning on you. The mode features different maps to play on, some easier than others. The AverageThe single player campaign is woefully average, from the graphics to the gameplay to the design, nothing about it stands out. The game has a filter to give the appearance that its being filmed by a cheap video camera, apparently this is suppose to make the game 'edgy' but in reality its incredibly annoying. The good news however is that you can turn this filter off. Technically the graphics are good giving you plenty of graphical options to play with yet artistically the game is boring, every level looks and feels the same and no risk or creativity was taken with the level design. In a third person shooter you need interesting set pieces to keep things fresh and engaging and this game has none of that. Every level plays out exactly the same way, enter a room, kill wave of enemies and proceed to the next area...rinse and repeat until the game is over. One aspect the campaign got right was your AI companion is actually useful and is pretty effective in combat, something that I rarely see in games these days, most AI companions are either incompetent, bullet sponges or distractions. The other positive thing I can say is that the campaign is short so you don't have to suffer through mediocrity for too long.The character Kane and Lynch are decently written but nothing really makes them stand out among the other generic videogame characters in the same genre.  The Bad:Multiplayer is dead as usual, shame, because if arcade mode is anything to go by, multiplayer looks like fun.ConclusionI never played Kane and Lynch before, the first one requires GFWL...so yeah... and this game did little to impress me. There are plenty of other great third person shooters on Steam worth your attention and money. This is a game you play when you have no other games to play. Worth purchasing at a steep discount. "

The developers, knowing how boring and predictable the game is thankfully only made it 3 hours long.

												After fully completing this with a friend when we got it on sale, I can officially say that this game was pretty awful, which made it fun.  The guns have crazy recoil and bad accuracy, there are weird stream lines coming from lights, the camera was shaky (which I turned off).  The game was so much fun because my friend and I didn't take it seriously (like everything else) and in turn made it fun.  This game has a lot of bad reviews, I recommend getting it on sale with a friend if you just want to have a laugh at this game.			"

												This game only took 3 hours to complete, that being said I only paid $2.50 for it so it meets my value requirements.  The gunplay is pretty fun, the recoil really isnt that bad just don't be firing on full auto.  Being an invulnerable tank is part of what makes the game fun.  The cover system is a little wonky but I didn't have much trouble with it, only got me killed a few times.  Your allies have the aim of a 5 year old attempting to fire a S&W 500 but is also an unkillable bullet sponge so I think thats a balance thing.This game gets more hate than it deserves, did the develpers mail it in? Probably. Is it still pretty fun? Yes. Is it worth buying? At $2.50 yes.			"

												I never was able to play the first game in the series, and went into this game knowing nothing about it or its background.I can't say very much for the story. It is violent, but I can't get a hold of the story. I'm a believer that you should be able to glean even a bit of story if you jump into a sequel, but there is none of that here. It almost seems as if you're just re-enacting a bunch of gunfight scenes from a bunch of different movies.One thing I noticed is that a lot of the game seems similar to those 'carnival-style' games where you have to shoot the ducks as they pop up behind obstacles.Another criticism I have is the lack of jumping. You have to crouch, then press a combination of forward and uncrouch. It's a 21st century 3D game, how hard is it to add jumping over obstacles?The graphics are fairly good, but I hate the way the camera moves. I get that its supposed to be mimicking a handheld camera, but it really goes over the top, and it makes it very hard to play the game.Also, the very-close over the shoulder angle is very difficult to play by.As for sound design, I found that in some of the cutscenes the background sounds were loud enough to encroach on the spoken words, and I had to rely on subtitles.I just don't think this is very much of a game. I guess if you're a fan of the series you might be able to make more out of it, but to me it just seems awful. "

												The campaign is short but is worth a playthrough. When you can get people on multiplayer it is really fun. Fragile alliance is a really great mode. Get it on a good sale and you will get some fun out of it. Get a friend and co-op will make it worth the price of admission as well.			"

												Good continuation of the last game, but in contrast the end of the game was THE most disappointing I've ever had.Without telling you how it plays out, it's abrupt, meaningless and hollow like there was supposed to be more somewhere.Shame, I really liked this series - though I can't tell if it's just my terrible taste in awkward shooters (such as Condemned).

There is no character development what so everPros:- Decent Gameplay- Good GraphicsCons:- Sloppy Story- Less than 5 hours of gameplay- crappy cover mechanic Verdict: 5/10  (Average) NOTE: If you are looking for some cheap fun have at it, if you wan't to play for the story go buy the 1st one			"

												If you find this game under 5€, and don't mind shaking camera, you'll enjoy it.It pretty much solves all problems of KL1, except lenght.Great thing about this game is the atmosphere and feel. It's so evil and dark. Rough.Characters are very well designed, once you know them you are never going to forget them.Cover system works very well.Graphics is absolutely amazing. Plus the camera effect. Its simply amazing.Also sound is great. There is no music, however you will never miss it. There is always something happening, including sounds.Game is very challanging on hardcore difficulty. Actually, its almost impossible. But enjoying.Well, its a great game. I completed it about three times, the replayability is good (since you can skip all cutscenes, the game tells you story on-foot).+perfect gamepad support			"

												I don't get why most people hate this game. I just finished it and I think it's really cool for what it is. The levels look great. The characters and the voice acting are awesome. And I actually like the shaky cam and the gritty digital camera look. The only downside to the game is, that it is very short (you can finish it in under 5 hours). I haven't really gotten into the multiplayer yet but it looks fun from what I've seen. Give it a try if it is on sale. You can get it for under 3€ if you're lucky. It's definitely worth it.			"

												I never was able to play the first game in the series, and went into this game knowing nothing about it or its background.I can't say very much for the story. It is violent, but I can't get a hold of the story. I'm a believer that you should be able to glean even a bit of story if you jump into a sequel, but there is none of that here. It almost seems as if you're just re-enacting a bunch of gunfight scenes from a bunch of different movies.One thing I noticed is that a lot of the game seems similar to those 'carnival-style' games where you have to shoot the ducks as they pop up behind obstacles.Another criticism I have is the lack of jumping. You have to crouch, then press a combination of forward and uncrouch. It's a 21st century 3D game, how hard is it to add jumping over obstacles?The graphics are fairly good, but I hate the way the camera moves. I get that its supposed to be mimicking a handheld camera, but it really goes over the top, and it makes it very hard to play the game.Also, the very-close over the shoulder angle is very difficult to play by.As for sound design, I found that in some of the cutscenes the background sounds were loud enough to encroach on the spoken words, and I had to rely on subtitles.I just don't think this is very much of a game.

The guns have crazy recoil and bad accuracy, there are weird stream lines coming from lights, the camera was shaky (which I turned off).  The game was so much fun because my friend and I didn't take it seriously (like everything else) and in turn made it fun.

												I love Kane and Lynch, don't get me wrong.Everything about the game itself is appealing and really well done.This is the second chapter in a third-person shooter franchise made by the creators of Hitman.It is gritty, it is vulgar and it is relentless.Most of the issues people complain about are the cinematic effects the developers chose.Which admittedly after awhile I did get nauseous, but you can turn it off in the settings menu.The most I can describe it is that the camera moves as you move.The idea was they wanted to give you the sense that you were being followed by a guy holding a camera.It's a cool concept and it was innovative going even further with blurred out ultra-violence...And I get that the dev's wanted a sense of realism and immersion. But such type of immersion hurts. Alot.Anyway, it's the port I have a real issue with. You see I have 184 products in my account and none of them have any issues launching...None except this one.It will get the start menu and crash upon clicking anything. I have to disable my internet connection if I want to play the game. That is really, really lame and there is 100% no excuse for such a thing.I will be uninstalling this as soon as I am done and never playing again.Gameplay 8/10Game on PC 5/10			"

												★★☆☆☆ - ""Average at best, Id give it a miss"" PROS:- Destruction effects are pretty good- Difficulty is just right and is a decent challenge (played on normal)- Range of guns and you you can shoot them at people or gas canistersCONS:- Cover system is awful, especially getting up into cover. The game will place you against any surface in the line of fire or not, many frustrating deaths to be had.- AI is terrible, they stand in the middle of nowhere going in circles or go through walls and kill you out of nowhere.- Both characters are unlikable.- Story is non-existant, but you dont care cause the characters are pants.- Controls are clunky.- Opponents, gameplay, script is all repetitive, even the animations are the same.- Shakey camera, I dont usually have a problem with this and understand its effects in both game & film, when done right. Here it isnt, its quite funny cause when you run you cant see a single thing.- Filter, there is some type of dull filter on the screen which makes everything look like dog crap, ah thats where they got the title from!VERDICT? I played this through just because I wanted to shoot at things but the game is just lazy in every aspect so I cannot recommend it.			"

												Didn't know exactly what to expect when I purchased this title.. So far it has been quite enjoyable. For a moment I actually thought that something was wrong with my monitor because their were blue lines going through my screen and some distortion, but it turned out to be part of the experience. You feel like someone is following you with a video recorder.. Took some getting used to but it really adds to the atmosphere of being in a run down part of town in constant gun fights, battling for your life while someone is filming the entire thing. Some areas can be quite challenging but overall fun. Has good graphics, sound, and controls.. The story is dramatic with some disturbing moments.. basically everything I paid for.			"

												Kane & Lynch 2 is another example of why the outside public believe gaming is aimed at an adolescent audience of monosyllabic thingy somethings.  The main focus of the game, being the story campaign, boils down to a 2.5-3 hour endurance of the two antagonists (Kane & Lynch if  you've forgotten already) cursing at one another, cursing at the triad, cursing at the police, cursing at the army and cursing at anyone else they feel like cursing at. The actual gameplay is a rather rudimentary objective consisting of trying to shoot and trying to hide, ""trying"" is what you'll be doing, as the overrall mechanics just work, if they were more polished, the game would be much shorter and easier to play than figuring out which side to aim from or which gun shoots better.  Not only is it not a particulary interesting game of hide and go shoot, but it tries so very hard to be mature by gratuitously showing 80s style video nasty sequences, in its approuch to appeal to an audience who think acting in such a manner would be considered edgy; by saying some rude words and shooting lots of people. An interesting side note would be the digital mosiacing of graphic scenes of violence, that for some reason is deemed to be too mature and gritty. Kinda of a dichotomy to the overall nature of the game.   The only few possitive things, one being the lead voice talent for Kane (Brian Bloom) and Lynch (Jarion Monroe ). The other being its unique approach to its visual asthetics, simulating digital video noise and video grime, bringing with it a documentarian style cinematography during its cut scenes which may be nauseating at times. But the immersive effect is often broken by the overall graphics looking poor and AI enemies missing key frames of animation when they move.  As a cultural artifact Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days is not something to be held with high regard.			"

												Like the first game this one is pretty good. It has about the same problems as the first, but as you don't control teammates the bad AI isn't that much a problem, and checkpointing was greatly improved. Overall much better than the first. The camera system is made to feel a bit like an amateur movie, and that's a bit distrubing at the first but once you get used to it, it's good. A lot of effects to reproduce this, like lens flares or ""bleeding"" lights, but it's ok because there's a reason. Unlike most FPS that uses lens flares. SP is very short but nice. Good game.			"

												★★☆☆☆ - ""Average at best, Id give it a miss"" PROS:- Destruction effects are pretty good- Difficulty is just right and is a decent challenge (played on normal)- Range of guns and you you can shoot them at people or gas canistersCONS:- Cover system is awful, especially getting up into cover. The game will place you against any surface in the line of fire or not, many frustrating deaths to be had.- AI is terrible, they stand in the middle of nowhere going in circles or go through walls and kill you out of nowhere.- Both characters are unlikable.- Story is non-existant, but you dont care cause the characters are pants.- Controls are clunky.- Opponents, gameplay, script is all repetitive, even the animations are the same.- Shakey camera, I dont usually have a problem with this and understand its effects in both game & film, when done right. Here it isnt, its quite funny cause when you run you cant see a single thing.- Filter, there is some type of dull filter on the screen which makes everything look like dog crap, ah thats where they got the title from!VERDICT? I played this through just because I wanted to shoot at things but the game is just lazy in every aspect so I cannot recommend it.			"

												Didn't know exactly what to expect when I purchased this title.. So far it has been quite enjoyable. For a moment I actually thought that something was wrong with my monitor because their were blue lines going through my screen and some distortion, but it turned out to be part of the experience. You feel like someone is following you with a video recorder.. Took some getting used to but it really adds to the atmosphere of being in a run down part of town in constant gun fights, battling for your life while someone is filming the entire thing. Some areas can be quite challenging but overall fun. Has good graphics, sound, and controls.. The story is dramatic with some disturbing moments.. basically everything I paid for.			"

Kane & Lynch 1 was really a good game and was a follow up of the freedom fighter 1 on pc for me. It's a shame that K&L2: DD is nothing like that. on the other hand game is long and hard.Never found anyone to try the multiplayer parts. what a shame. p.s. there is a naked mission in game!  "

												Kane and Lynch 2: Dog Days. What can I say about this game... Well, it's mildly entertaining and does have some nice set pieces, moments, etc. But, after the 4 hours (3.8 to be exact) it took to beat the game, I'm left saying, ""meh"" to it all.The story is pretty hum-drum, i.e. The big crime boss' daughter gets killed and suddenly, *SPOILER* you're in the line of fire for being the ones that got her killed. And if you think it gets any further than that, story-wise, you'd be wrong. It just felt like a generic 80's film where some americans shoot some guns at the ""bad guys"" with the loosest possible plot being attached. Oh, and Kane & Lynch are not exactly likeable, so...yeah, there's that.The gameplay itself is enjoyable to a point, but it does get pretty repetitive. Take cover, shoot at some menz. Run up to the next area, but, oh no, more menz! Best take cover and shoot them when possible! Rinse and repeat. There's nothing else in this game! No variation. Well, except for a brief helicoptor ride, but that's all I can remember.And the last thing I want to touch on are the graphics. They're ok, but, the FOV is HORRIBLE! For the first time ever, a small FOV actually did make me slightly nauseous. Well done K&L2, no other game has ever done that to me! Also, some of the art style choices were a little odd. E.g. the game censors people who you shoot in the face. Legitimately, it puts that mosquito looking haze over someone's face! But it never explains why it does this. If it's a style choice, it's a strange one for a game. And there are parts of the game where dead characters are similarly covered in this hazy effect to hide their nudity or injuries. Lighting could also have weird (not even as good as) J.J. Abrams lens flare effects!Overall, I have to say, it's not worth recommending. I mean, true, taking down the gangster's henchmen while juggling which guns to pick up from the bodies that littered the streets, was mildly entertaining as a game. If it's a couple of quid and you just want some mindless shooting with a minimal plot, go for it. Anything more and you're in a HUGE disappointment. But yeah, it's not really a recommendation! Saying that, try it, don't try it. But don't say I didn't warn you :)			"

It's a cover/corridor shooter, the  story should have been more fleshed out, and you run into a bug every here and there.  It's not something I'm going to remember or rave about, but it was worth a play-through.I rate it ""good gaem"".			"

												I have been on Steam for more than 10+ years now, and this is the first time ive EVER written a review...  That's how dissapointed i am with this game.  First of all...  I finished the game in just over 2.5 hours.  It was fun for a while (Maybe the first 30 minutes) but it was over WAY to quickly...  Now i know what chicks feel like...  This game also has near game-breaking bugs.  For example: when i started the second level, the game was litterally running at 1fps.  I had to constantly alt-tab the game to keep the glitch in check.  This is more than what i can say for the first version of this game.  The entire game runs a 1fps reguardless of the gfx settings, or any tweaks or hacks.  This game doesn't have this issue in an unfixable way, but it did threaten to do that 1-FPS thing -- just like the first Kane & Lynch game.In short...  I bought the two game ""Kane & Lynch 2"" and ""Kane & Lynch 1""  I payed under $4.00 for the both oth them.  And although i could finish ""Kane & Lynch 2"" - the first one was unplayable even on my High-End gaming rig.  Compatibality issues caused the game to run at 1-fps.  So if you wan't to kill 2 hours play ""Kane & Lynch 2"".  But STAY AWAY from ""Kane & Lynch 1""P.S.  The ending sucked!			"

												Before anything, you should take note that this game has to most daring title you can find in the whole of gaming industry. This game is racist, in the way that you and your best buddy are 2 white dudes taking on and killing battalions after battalions of Chinese gangsters, soldiers, special forces, apaches, and any chinese being which you care to put a bullet throguh. All the female characters in this game are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥killed/kill♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ except for the air-stewardess at the end, which maybe the main characters will♥♥♥♥♥♥as well. Shanghai is your playground, where the dammages you will cause are in the billions. This game is also highly queer as you and your best buddy are two middle aged white men, of which they have shown affection towards each other, and this affection grows strong as one of the men, Lynch, screws up over and over again while the other, Kane, sticks with him throughout the series. These two men are bonded by sweat, blood, tears and expletives. A fine piece of affection is displayed between these two men throughout the game. This game has gore as well, though which game doesn't?But the thing is, why does this game have to censord anything that they feel ""gruesome"" or ""obscene""?! I don't really care if a naked girl is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and gutted and killed with blood and sperm all over the place, or that a girl is stripped off her underwear, showing her pubes (or that she doesn't have pubes), or even if the two protagonists have their 7-inch ding-dongs (not measured) dangling out and swaying around in a pendulum motion, but why the hell do you have to put mosaique on almost everything?! That girl without her underwear looks like some actress from Japanese pornography, and so do the two main characters and their hanging ding-dongs! Worse still, any gore are censorded with squarish mosaique boxes. Meaning: headshot - censorded. Blood, censorded. Naked chicks, censorded. You got shot, censorded... Not that I care about a few extra boxes (well, I actually do when you are censording cute naked girls, just saying), but do you have any idea how laggy those mosaique boxes are? My computer has no problem running Dark Souls 2 at max setting, but my system hanged while the mosaique strikes - the only time my computer crashed when I run any games! Heck. Talking about bugs, please do expect some unforeseen circumstances, such as the loss of voice, sudden lags, teleporting enemies, and, for my pal, the inability to deal any dammage. Yes, this game is quite buggy at times, especially when you are in a co-op game with your pal, so do expect some turbulence at times.I am not saying that this game isn't good. The story-line is worth exploring with your pal, but please bear in mind that this game does NOT contain a free-world, meaning both the story and the maps are extremely linear. You walk from point A to point B, cutscenes, repeat. Some of you might like this bold story, and others might not. Whatever the case it is, try it, but only at an extremely discounted price.			"

												I thought I had experienced it all. F.E.A.R 3, X-Blades, Resident Evil: Operation Racoon City, but none of those games were nearly as bad as Kane and Lynch 2. It has all the worst elements of bad video games: -a non existent story with two very boring chacters Kane: The boring guy and Lynch: ARGAAHAHARGH-bad gunplay with half the guns being terrible and the other half being so good they are broken-enemy ai that goes between ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and aimbot in a matter of a second -one of the most sickening artstyles ever with the discion to make the players viewpoint that of a camera following the player complete with pixilation and sound distortion which just wobbles back and forth when you sprint and makes you sick -enemies that spawn out of corners like Time Crisis and just knock you over and insta death you-bugs -bad netcode. I thought I had played some of the worst games ever but this blows those out of the water with how bad it is. Usually at least when a game is bad I can find something funny about it to make it entertaining. This game is just painful to play with it's only saving grace being that it ends before you decide to shoot yourself.I give this game a ♥♥♥♥in Disgusting Dog♥♥♥♥♥♥10.Not even worth playing if it was free.

												Game sucks in so many ways. I got it against all bad reviews since I wanted a story about an evil protagonist.  It's lame.  Postal 2 was way better than this Kids rating game.  I was expecting the Teletubbies and Barney to come in for fun.  This game is meant for people who still believe in Santa and are made to feel uncomfortable easily.			"

												Kane and Lynch 2: Dog Days is the worst video game I have ever played.The story begins with Kane and Lynch in Shanghai trying to scrape together a gun running deal.  Before the deal goes down, Lynch drags Kane to go settle a grudge match with some guy for some reason.  The duo accidentally kill a girl who happens to be the daughter of some government bureaucrat with enough money, power, and influence to not only control his own gang, but the police and even the Chinese military.  His goons pursue Kane and Lynch.  Kane and Lynch get caught and tortured.  What follows is the most gruesome, unncessary, and tasteless sequence in an already awful game, in which we see our lovely protagonists running around naked and covered and blood.  Then they get captured again, get taken to the villain's building, and decide to kill him while they're there, because why not?  After killing him, they escape, and the player is left wondering what the point was.Because having a shallow, pointless, and disgusting plot wasn't enough, the game also features a shallow, pointless, and disgusting graphical gimmick.  The entire game is designed to look like it's being filmed on a handheld camera.  This makes no sense in-universe since nobody with a camera is actually following the duo around.  The result is shaky cam that would disgust Paul Greengrass, horrible looking lens flares, and a generally disgusting visual aesthetic.  The effect is amplified when running, and will make you want to puke as the visuals go out of focus and shake wildly.  Just charming!The gameplay is built around simple, co-operative third person shooting.  It's about as standard and bland as it can get.  Headshots instant-kill enemies that would otherwise be massive bullet sponges.  You hide behind cover (which feels miserable).  There are the mandatory ""stealth"" sequences that don't actually work.  A turret level.  Shooting down helicopters.  Pretty much all of it is standard to the point of being boring, or it would be if not for the horrific AI.  The enemies are both dumb and dangerous, featuring absurdly good aim (despite the guns being horribly inaccurate when you wield them) and bricks for brains.  They also have a tendency to only peek out of cover for a fraction of a second at a time, turning the game into an obnoxious whack-a-mole clone.  The terrible AI is made even more obvious in coop, since the AI will only ever target one player at a time, and will instantaneously snap between the two.  Because of this, it's not uncommon to sneak up on an enemy only to have them abruptly spin 180 and kill you.  Getting killed is also very frustrating in coop.  You can mash E to stay alive longer so they can come help you up, but the timer is really short and mashing E appears to make absolutely no difference in the amount of time you can survive.  In addition, the E key is used for pretty much everything, so it's not terribly uncommon to try to pick up a friend and find your character instead picking up a fire extinguisher.  While mentioning multiplayer, I should also mention that my experience was extremely laggy.  This could have been my connection, but I think the game just has bad netcode.A terrible story, hideous visuals, and awful gameplay are capped off with glitchy animation and showstopping bugs.  Numerous animations look quick and jerky.  When you open doors to proceed to the next room, the animation just cuts midway through.  Later in the game my friend and I began to experience characters getting stuck on geometry, massive frame-drops, garbled video, and outright crashes.  The game barely feels functional at all.Kane and Lynch 2: Dog Days is the worst.  When the game isn't glitching itself into unplayability, it's merely disgusting and unpleasant to experience.  9/10 pretty ok.			"

												Has a sickeningly wobbly camera like a drunk with parkinsons following you with a camcorder. Thankfully you can turn it off in the options, problem avoided. Otherwise it gives me a really bad headache.The shooting system is only decent, but still manages to be satisfying when you figure out which weapons are horribly innacurate (useless) so you can avoid picking them up unless you are out of ammo and have no choice which normally isn't a problem. There's no time to ♥♥♥♥ around with garbage weapons when you get downed in only a few hits. As far as everything else? I love it. Super violent, plenty of attitude, and it is dark and gritty, even as dark as Max Payne 3. Kane & Lynch are really awesome badass characters, some of the best I've ever seen in any game. If nothing else, pick it up for some solid movie-style fun. And give us a K&L 3, you A holes.			"

												I don't usually recommend games that are physically painful to play, but Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days has managed to defy the odds and gain my love.I'd like to preface this review by saying that I have not played the first game, Dead Men, in the series, but I am fully up to date with the story and many of the gameplay elements. The first one never drew in my attention because of certain mechanics it used, but this one did.Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days is the second instalment in a third person cover based action shooter game series focused around the stories of two guys. Kane, and Lynch. Kane, a man with a questionable past and morals (who was the main playable character in the first game) has come to Shanghai to visit his... partner, Lynch, a literal psychotic with who he has worked with before, in order to do some business with him. I won't help into too many details, but as expected, things go bad really quickly, and you're thrust into a non stop action thrill ride that will either make you violently ill, or wanting more.What do I mean by this? Well, if you've played the first game, you'll know that it was a fairly normal feeling third person shooter, in which you played as Kane and focused on his story. Now, the focus is put on Lynch, the psychotic. And boy, the game sure does feel like it was made with you actually controlling a psychotic. If Dead Men was a Kane focused normal third person shooter, Dog Days is a Lynch focused psychotic trip.The way this is accomplished is mainly by the visuals and camera, which I feel is one of the biggest draws in the game. The visuals in Dog Days behave as though the entire game was being filmed by someone with a camera. There are visual artefacts, intense glare, and blur/pixelation effects used throughout the game. When you get shot, you might see your screen go fuzzy in some areas. If you see a bright light, you might get intense glare. If you shoot a civilian in the face, you might get a pixelated area where their face should be. These are all really neat features and really help to make the game feel like a video. While these have a relatively minor impact on gameplay, there is one more effect that is always in use that may make or break the game for you. The screen shake.The screen in this game is ALWAYS shaking. And I do mean ALWAYS. Even when you're crounching behind an obstacle, the screen is still shaking slightly. Sprinting make the camera shake like you'd expect someone sprinting with a video camera would. You get shot? Shaking. You need to run? Shaking. Getting into cover? Do you even need an answer? And considering this game really is non stop action with hardly even a minute of relaxation every now and then, the screen is going to be shaking more than wet dog that's had 50 cups of cold coffee in the snow. This shaking, along with the other effects, can make the game more difficult to play, and can make it difficult to see enemies sometimes, it is also the cause of many headaches from many people, and it's clear to see why. And yet, I absolutely adore this feature. Once again, it really helps with giving the game a gritty feel, and a sense of speed and urgency. Everything is always moving so fast, and Lynch, being a psychotic, obviously has a harder time dealing with it than most people. He's in constant pain, and to a degree, you feel this as well.Speaking of fast, by god is this game fast paced There's no collectables or anything to slow you down, and the game in constantly RUN AND SHOOT COVER AND SHOOT RUN AND SHOOT COVER AND SHOOT REPEAT FORVER! The game can be pretty difficult as it doesn't take much for you to get killed, but you also regenerate life fairly quickly and this works really well. Since you play as Lynch for the majority of the game, you always have the computer (or other player) controlling Kane, who is with you for almost the entire game. You can't give him any commands or whatever and he just deals with things himself, and he can't die, so there's no reason to pay mind to him. But the banter between the characters in game is really enjoyable and he doesn't have any negative effect on the game at all. The game is build around having these 2 together and it does so well. If you hate having an extra character constantly tag alone, like Ashley is RE4, Shiva in RE5, or Alyx in HL2, I assure you, the game works really with both of these characters and you are still in complete control the entire time. No waiting for the other character, no inventory management, no revival, or anything like that exists. At least not in single player. In multiplayer, a revival mechanic does exist, but not the other stuff.However while the game is really fast paced, naturally, the game is also over really fast. It takes only 4 hours to beat the main campaign, and I'm counting deaths. If you managed to beat this game without dying (extremely difficult even on normal difficulty and probably on easy, I'd say I died about 100 times on my first playthrough, and don't worry, there's VERY frequent checkpoints) then you're looking at maybe 3  or 2 and a half hours of straight gameplay. While this is a con, the game is VERY jam packed and never has a dull moment to lengthen it out. It also have several extra missions that you can play alone or in multiplayer which add a few hours. I also feel the game is very replayable, as there are no skills trees or anything to worry about. This is a game that starts fast and keep going.The story, while nothing particularly noteworthy, does at least draw you into the feelings and thought of the 2 main characters, who are still totally jerks, but ones that you can't help but feel sorry for.Music that shows up now and then isn't very noticeable and very forgettable, but isn't bad, and sound effects are fine for the most part. There are some glitches in the game, like the screen going grey and not showing the game, but these are rare and usually fixed just by restarting the game. The weapons feel pretty good to me to be honest, but some seem to not like the sound of them. True, they don't feel overly strong, but since you're shooting 90% of the time anyway, I feel that they feel strong enough. Some of the guns also feel as though they have little to no accuracy to them (except the shotguns, which have a pretty good range for most videogame shotguns) but these weapons are quickly replaced by much better guns with better accuracy. In general, the gunplay feels quite good, covering works fine (most of the time), and it's a joy to play.Sometimes, it also feels like the game hates you, as some parts are incredibly difficult, even at the start, and the ending really seems to come out of nowhere and leaves you asking ""was that it... seriously?"", but to be honest, I feel this is very refreshing, and sort of goes along with the struggle of Lynch through the game and his deranged mind.All in all, Dog Days is a fantastic game, but one that most people will not enjoy. I feel as though a game like this will never be made again considering the reception it got, so this is one of a kind. It's sick, twisted, sad, and psychotic, just like Lynch. And I wouldn't have it any other way.Want to keep updated on games I recommend? I'm a curator! Follow me here!http://store.steampowered.com/curator/8963340-NeonAbomination/ "

The sound work is bad, the characters are bad, the game crashes and is fairly buggy. The net code for coop play is bad and it'll make all the enemies sake and warp. The AI is bad as you'll see throngs of them run single file through doorways you're shooting into.Do not touch this game. It will be the worst experience of your life.			"

												You might wanna ask why don't I recommend this game based on four hours playtime. Well guess what, that's how long it took me to beat it. I finished it in one evening in co-op with my friend. And that's the only reason I really enjoyed those four hours. Because I played the story in multiplayer. Otherwise everything is wrong. The enemy is dumb as hell, the story sucks, the gameplay is somehow weird - but that might be me, and before you can get into the ""story"" or to know the characters it's over with the most wtf are you kidding me ending ever to be seen. I thought it's a bug when the credits came up. If I bought this game for full price at the time it was released I am pretty sure I would have sent some unpleasant package to the developers right away. Play this if you wanna do some shooter with your friend in co-op and you're not interested in non-story multiplayer like CS or CoD or such are. Otherwise there's no reason to even touch this.			"

KANE & LYNCH: DOG DAYSA flawed follow up to Kane & Lynch: Dead Men that covers much the same ground.Rating 4/10Great art style, setting and characters in a story that doesn't go anywhere. Its greatest strength is the style; similar to lo-fi handheld shaky cam. The setting of Shanghai is also well realised, showing the seedy underbelly with bustling streets and markets however in later levels it reverts to overused locations such as warehouses and docks.It also suffers the same problems as Kane and Lynch: Dead Men, great characters but stale and awkward gameplay. Simple mechanics such as getting into cover can be tricky and the aiming is clumsy at times. There also aren't any real variants on the gameplay, often narrow alleyways where it's a repetitive game of whack a mole, popping in and out of cover until it's safe to proceed. The recent Spec Ops had an interesting story to make up for it's lack of gameplay, Kane and Lynch Dog Days has two great disaster-prone characters but not a great story. It's also so short the first time I completed it I thought it was the end of Act 1 only to realise it was the end of the game, and incredibly short single player campaign that ends suddenly.  Multiplayer isn't much better as it died a month or so after release and now it's impossible to find other players.There are far better 3rd person shooters out there now such as Kane and Lynch: Dead Men, Max Payne 3 and Spec Ops which all do it better. Worth picking up for the art style alone but don't expect much from the game.			"

												This game is a real turd. Avoid it at all costs, even if it sells for pennies, avoid it. There is absolutely nothing good to say about it. The graphics are terrible. The controls are terrible. The characters are terrible. The music is the worst I have ever heard, and I use the term music very, very loosely here. The sound work is bad, the characters are bad, the game crashes and is fairly buggy. The net code for coop play is bad and it'll make all the enemies sake and warp. The AI is bad as you'll see throngs of them run single file through doorways you're shooting into.Do not touch this game. It will be the worst experience of your life.			"

Campaign, co-op campaign and single arcade modes are good fun! Mp sadly empty.  One down more is the missing split-screen for campaign, arcade and mp-modes. Shame u devs, thats unfinished.

												The first game finished so badly (one of the ending anyways) that it had to continue with Kane & Lynch 2. Thats a good thing, right ? Nope. Not here.  The story uses the same overused theme thats been done in movies and games since the beginning of games...revenge. Its predictable from start to finish which is kind of boring if you think about it. Theres no more character dept and Kane stops Lynch from learning more from each other right from the start, Personally I think its the biggest mistake that the devs made.For the gameplay, I have to be honest what impressed me the most are 2 things. First is the enemy AI...It's brutal. If you take cover and don't look around you, the enemy will come up to you and ♥♥♥♥ you up. That is impressive since most AI will just stay behind cover and shoot you endlessly without anything more to do.Second is the cover system. Far from perfect but at least this time I press C to activate it so in a very wierd way...its works. Since Kane & Lynch : Dead Men, the cover didn't work almost all the time.The game forces you to change weapons since enemies don't use all the same weapon so its possible you'll run out of ammo for a specific weapon so you'll have to change. I personally don't mind that because it forces you to change strategy to kill your enemies (don't snipe with a shotgun) and you have to think about ammo conservation as well.Level design is the most absurb thing besides the story of course. What you see is only Shanghai city...its the same view you get from room to room, to buildings to ... well everything looks the same. So level design is just really bad, boring not appealing at all. Story doesn't make any sense to me, why the hell are they staying in Shanghai ? Everyone in the city goes after them and the only thing they have in mind is...complete the transaction...stay here. WTF ??? It's just an excuse to use the same textures over and over....and I completed the game in 4 hours...shorter than the first one.Sorry but this is not recommended. If at least they would of done a great job with the level design I would of recommended this. If you add everything with the bad levels, the game becomes unacceptable.			"

												After playing Kane and Lynch first game I have high hopes for this game.  Game had story.  Characters were distinct.  Each level was different.  Leaderboard make people cry.Kane and Lynch 2 is a game where you play same level over and over again.  You shoot either Chinese street brawler, Chinese police or Chinese army enemy across map from behind cover.  When loading level it give me message saying this is not racist.  Just coincidence that everyone you kill is Chinese.  Once I shoot some helicopter.Levels are small such as go around corner in street or run through abandoned pillars.  At one point you shoot out of helicopter but level last 5 minute.  If no texture load then you see that every level is the same.Cover system is very bad.  Most time I did not bother hugging wall and just line up shot by standing near corner.  Enemy cannot hit me but I kill them no skill.  When I use cover I get hit.Many gun bad.  Really bad.  Like you do cover battle with uzi.  Uzi terrible.  Shotgun seem like only accurate weapon until you fight army.  But you only carry enough ammo to kill like 3 Chinese at any one time.Story line is terrible.  Kane do some deal and need Lynch.  For some reason you try kill some man in underwear but kill wife.  Then you try to patch wound by just killing anyone Chinese.  Lynch new wife get killed.  You then need to run around a level completely naked with Kane.  At end of level Kane give a motivation speech completely naked.  It should make you say ""Yeah, let's do this"" but pixel♥♥♥♥♥♥kill moment.  After long cold shower I play final level on skyscraper then airport whilst crying into my goat's milk.Lynch is no longer crazy man who need pill otherwise everyone appear like bunny.  Kane no longer leader with all the ideas.  It is like watching James Bond film after Sean Connery leave.  Everything different.  Tim Dalton different.Multiplayer is dead but new arcade mode is only good thing about game.  Arcade mode made into new game called Payday 2.I wish I never play this game.  It is very bad and make me very upset.  Like hearing joke about He-Man sexuality when older.  I have the power.If you really hate someone tell them to play this game.			"

												The camera is insanely shaky. Until I found the setting to disable it, I literally couldn't tell what was going on in the game. Shooting mechanics are also pretty terrible with every weapon having ~3% accuracy. I'd be okay if weapons had imperfect accuracy like a Gears of War game, but the sheer amount of enemies who are almost always in near perfect cover makes for tedious fights that force you to charge ahead only because your ammo capacity is too low for a firefight.

												I don't know quite what to say about this game. It has contempt, utter contempt, for videogames and for the player, and it's ugly -- very, very ugly. They've done something very strange here; it's a game about bad people doing bad things and destroying themselves because of it. The protagonists are not likeable, and the people they kill are only trying to kill them because Kane and Lynch tried to kill them first. It's very stylized, but the style is terrible -- the whole game, from beginning to end, looks like a badly framed video shot handheld on a terrible camcorder.People criticize it for being too short, which was valid when it was Sixty US Dollars, but is no longer the case. If you want to play a cover shooter for thirty hours, you're probably not going to want to play a game which seems to deliberately destroy everything that justifies those games. This is a game about the death of the American Dream. Play it.			"

												I'm recommending this on the premise that I got this from a sale at $2.50At this price, it's worth it to me. Players can skip the DLC because most of it pertains to the multiplayer which many players have moved on from this point in time.Treat this game as a B rated movie with some realistic sentiments from those that wheel and deal in illegal contraband. It isn't anything really special when it comes to acting and the set pieces.As for the gameplay, it's a generic third person shooter.  For a game in recent memory, Spec Ops follows this same flow as well: 2-3 weapons, regenerating health and pop out of cover-drop some guys.  Rinse and repeat.Also for those that are curious about play time, it's about 3 hours long with gameplay and watching all of the cutscenes.			"

												I bought this cheap and I'm still disappointed. The first K&L felt like a decent B movie. You could see some thought and soul in it. This one, feels like the corporate rip-off of a sequel that always follows. The camera is terrible. I'm not usually picky on this but it appears they just gave a camcorder to some random buzzed out teenager and said ""watch us do stuff"". There's actually a part later in the game where the already bad camera becomes worse. There's nothing new or exciting for gameplay. In fact, I would argue they actually downgraded on the gameplay from the first. Kane and Lynch are...boring. With the exception of some shock value scenes, there's very little to grasp you into the story line. Overall, the only way I can recommend this is if you're like me and enjoy terrible games. (The sort of idea that it's so bad, I have to see it).			"

												Welcome to the lives of Kane and Lynch. One man is a psychopath who just loves the thrill of crime, the other a psychopath who blacks out in fits of murderous rampages when his medication wears off basically. The unlikely duo have one last deal to do in Shanghai before they stop their crime ridden lives to live in normalcy...of course this deal goes horribly wrong when a government official who is involved with the mob daughter gets shot by Lynch on accident and dies.The games story is very much a crime drama, and if you're into that the story alone is more than enough to keep you hooked through the four hour campaign. Yes, the campaign is THAT short, though this isn't that bad of a thing. I feel like if the game were any longer it would have wore out its welcome. I say this because the gameplay is your standard third person shooter.You take cover on walls, you can pick up weapons and ammo dropped by dead bodies, and when you get knocked down before death you get one more shot to get back up before you're down for the count. This is all fun and well even with the linear progression, but taking out one horde of cops, thugs, and scumbags after another does become slightly repetitive.The game is more style over substance than anything with how the camera is. The camera works like a camera man is following you through the campaign filming every little thing with a grainy, somewhat low res camera. Kane and Lynch 2 does this very well, and it goes with the gritty graphics, story, and violence perfectly, though it can sometimes be a strain on the eyes.Overall I recommend the game. If you like violent crime drama films you'll feel right at home with this game. If you're against a ton of blood and dead bodies all over the place...Well, you should probably stay far away from Kane and Lynch.			"

Finally once I get it up and running, the ambience overshadows the voice acting (which sucks anyway) and the story doesn't make sense. Gameplay is laughable. You run so damn fast. Easy is too easy and hard is too hard. Not fun. Buy it if you want something to laugh at with a buddy, but even then it's kinda sketchy. 1/10...maybe.			"

												It's a very intense game. Personally, I think it's one of the greatest criminal games I've ever played. For one thing, there really isn't much of a stumble effect, where you have no control over your character if he falls down, takes damage etc. That really doesn't happen much in this game. While the storyline is a tad short, the single player AND multiplayer Fragile Alliance mode will undoubtedly serve you a good 4 - 6 weeks of replayability. This game is Well worth the purchase if you ask me.			"

 Pros -  Some degree of realism.  Shots to the head or upper torso kill you instanty (in  Extreme  difficulty atleast). Shots to other body parts hurt you or knock you down.-  Nice setting.  You get a glimpse of the dangerous life in the dark alleys of Shanghai. Cons -  The camera is horrible.  I don't understand what the developers were going for. The shaky portable-like camera during sprints and cutscenes was a bad idea. It didn't make the game any better, it makes your life more difficult. On the bright side, you can turn on Steady Camera.-  The aim system is bad...  I couldn't find a better way to put this. I know aiming a gun in real life isn't easy but the way it behaves in this game makes  Extreme  difficulty unnecessarily stupid. Enemies have incredible aim and range (they are police officers, SWAT agents and Shanghai gangsters after all), they can headshot you from a ridiculous distance or atleast kill you with a couple of shots. In my opinion, the least the game could do is let you aim your guns properly from the same range (or any range above 10 feet (~3 meters)) to stand a chance.-  Checkpoints are too spaced.  Yes, this is one of  those  games. You spend half an hour trying to get through a tough spot or a difficult situation where you're always outnumbered and outgunned, only to be killed by that last single ************. What happens? You start way back there, one or maybe two areas before that one. Again, really frustrating in  Extreme  difficulty.-  Graphics.  Not as relevant as the former cons but still. They aren't total garbage but they're not good either. Some edges and textures are poor and the shaky camera just makes it worse (or better if it can distract you from them).In conclusion, I wouldn't recommend this to most people. If you like the chinese setting and/or old school clunky gameplay go ahead and try it. Or if you're that guy that wants to try every shooter out there, try it aswell. But don't say I didn't warn you :POh and don't judge me on only 3 hours game time. I had played this before without Steam and I thought I'd play it one more time. Not one of my best decisions... I stand by what I've said in this review.			"

												This game makes no sense after the first one. Both are pretty bad to begin with. Bad voice acting and dialogue. This game gives me a headache with all the shaky cam. How does it pick up right in china after you leave Lynch at god knows where after the first one and hes okay with that??? 0/10 came in edios anthology.			"

												Who in there right mind would  recommend this game? Its terrible. Cover mechanics is terrible and outright doesnt work most of the time. The game is short and not worth playing. There are a ton of better FPS out there at this high price. Terrible game do not buy this. I have saved you. I must be a hero!			"

 Pros -  Some degree of realism.  Shots to the head or upper torso kill you instanty (in  Extreme  difficulty atleast). Shots to other body parts hurt you or knock you down.-  Nice setting.  You get a glimpse of the dangerous life in the dark alleys of Shanghai. Cons -  The camera is horrible.  I don't understand what the developers were going for. The shaky portable-like camera during sprints and cutscenes was a bad idea. It didn't make the game any better, it makes your life more difficult. On the bright side, you can turn on Steady Camera.-  The aim system is bad...  I couldn't find a better way to put this. I know aiming a gun in real life isn't easy but the way it behaves in this game makes  Extreme  difficulty unnecessarily stupid. Enemies have incredible aim and range (they are police officers, SWAT agents and Shanghai gangsters after all), they can headshot you from a ridiculous distance or atleast kill you with a couple of shots. In my opinion, the least the game could do is let you aim your guns properly from the same range (or any range above 10 feet (~3 meters)) to stand a chance.-  Checkpoints are too spaced.  Yes, this is one of  those  games. You spend half an hour trying to get through a tough spot or a difficult situation where you're always outnumbered and outgunned, only to be killed by that last single ************. What happens? You start way back there, one or maybe two areas before that one. Again, really frustrating in  Extreme  difficulty.-  Graphics.  Not as relevant as the former cons but still. They aren't total garbage but they're not good either. Some edges and textures are poor and the shaky camera just makes it worse (or better if it can distract you from them).In conclusion, I wouldn't recommend this to most people. If you like the chinese setting and/or old school clunky gameplay go ahead and try it. Or if you're that guy that wants to try every shooter out there, try it aswell. But don't say I didn't warn you :POh and don't judge me on only 3 hours game time. I had played this before without Steam and I thought I'd play it one more time. Not one of my best decisions... I stand by what I've said in this review.			"

												Aside from the blurred out headshots that happen at times this game isn't too bad. There are certainly plenty of flaws, but as a straight shooter and something to play for a few hours it certainly hits the mark. If you are able to play coop with someone that would be the best choice, but good luck finding anyone.			"

												I'm recommending this on the premise that I got this from a sale at $2.50At this price, it's worth it to me. Players can skip the DLC because most of it pertains to the multiplayer which many players have moved on from this point in time.Treat this game as a B rated movie with some realistic sentiments from those that wheel and deal in illegal contraband. It isn't anything really special when it comes to acting and the set pieces.As for the gameplay, it's a generic third person shooter.  For a game in recent memory, Spec Ops follows this same flow as well: 2-3 weapons, regenerating health and pop out of cover-drop some guys.  Rinse and repeat.Also for those that are curious about play time, it's about 3 hours long with gameplay and watching all of the cutscenes.			"

												Kane & Lynch are two characters I've liked since the first game.In this sequel they pair up again and quickly end up in deep trouble with various parts of the underworld, gangs and police.Story is good and gritty like the first.Gameplay is mixed in that some weapons can feel pretty useless with not much accuracy, while others are great and effective. Enviromental destruction is decent in some levels too.Thirdperson can be troublesome given the ""shaky-cam"" effect...but I liked the whole cam-corder reality vibe and stuck with it. (you can turn it off in options)Graphics and sound are good. To sum up, I really liked it but I can see why others don't.			"

												Welcome to the lives of Kane and Lynch. One man is a psychopath who just loves the thrill of crime, the other a psychopath who blacks out in fits of murderous rampages when his medication wears off basically. The unlikely duo have one last deal to do in Shanghai before they stop their crime ridden lives to live in normalcy...of course this deal goes horribly wrong when a government official who is involved with the mob daughter gets shot by Lynch on accident and dies.The games story is very much a crime drama, and if you're into that the story alone is more than enough to keep you hooked through the four hour campaign. Yes, the campaign is THAT short, though this isn't that bad of a thing. I feel like if the game were any longer it would have wore out its welcome. I say this because the gameplay is your standard third person shooter.You take cover on walls, you can pick up weapons and ammo dropped by dead bodies, and when you get knocked down before death you get one more shot to get back up before you're down for the count. This is all fun and well even with the linear progression, but taking out one horde of cops, thugs, and scumbags after another does become slightly repetitive.The game is more style over substance than anything with how the camera is. The camera works like a camera man is following you through the campaign filming every little thing with a grainy, somewhat low res camera. Kane and Lynch 2 does this very well, and it goes with the gritty graphics, story, and violence perfectly, though it can sometimes be a strain on the eyes.Overall I recommend the game. If you like violent crime drama films you'll feel right at home with this game. If you're against a ton of blood and dead bodies all over the place...Well, you should probably stay far away from Kane and Lynch.			"

												Heh...bad bad game. I played the co-op. First off it took so many tweaks to get this thing to work without the sound glitching. Also, connection problems. Finally once I get it up and running, the ambience overshadows the voice acting (which sucks anyway) and the story doesn't make sense. Gameplay is laughable. You run so damn fast. Easy is too easy and hard is too hard. Not fun. Buy it if you want something to laugh at with a buddy, but even then it's kinda sketchy. 1/10...maybe.			"

												It's a very intense game. Personally, I think it's one of the greatest criminal games I've ever played. For one thing, there really isn't much of a stumble effect, where you have no control over your character if he falls down, takes damage etc. That really doesn't happen much in this game. While the storyline is a tad short, the single player AND multiplayer Fragile Alliance mode will undoubtedly serve you a good 4 - 6 weeks of replayability. This game is Well worth the purchase if you ask me.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Kane and Lynch 2: Dog Days is a game developed by IO Interactive and published by Eidos Interactive and Square Enix and is a sequel to Kane and Lynch: Dead MenEverything about this game is so middle of the road, from the ordinary combat & weapons, to the glitchy mess that is the cover systemThe story is no better either. An annoying shaky cam and some choices with censorship I am confused by. This game isn't that great, nor is it bad... its just mehKane and Lynch 2: Dog Days is a good time to play with a mate for a few hours and enjoy the overall clunkyness and ability to murder countless civilians Pick it up cheap and with a friend as it's not worth it outside of that...

												If ever there were a time to recommend Kane & Lynch 2, now would be that time.With the sudden glut of shooters focused on characters going mad, the darkness of the average video-game player-character, and what I see as the start of unique artistic approaches to games (see: Routine, Tangiers, etc), it should be clear that this game was well before its time.It was critically derided, despite being Spec Ops: The Line's nasty older brother. The censored headshots turn a stomach far faster than the gory over the top madness of any other game that comes to mind. The visual style is bright, eyepopping, unique, will never be seen again due to gamers not being ready for the game when it was released.This game is worth a playthrough if you want to taste blood, smell sweat, hate yourself. That is in no way a point against it as a game -- it is uniquely visceral, and we will have a hard time seeing another game willing to go so far until the critical backlash from it is forgotten.			"

												Did you like K&L? It had a good story, ok gunplay, levels were more or less varied, etc.This is not that game. It's got a gritty presentation, that's it. The story is not worth mentioning. Lynch calls Kane to work with him on a weapons deal in Shanghai, supposedly his last deal, before he wants to spend life with his daughter (who hates him). That's it. Everything around that is just bland paste of names who are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off.The German version is also severely cut (pixelated headshots (even after death), enemies don't really die, but are just ""injured"", etc.). You can kinda get around with it, because the impression is that Lynch is being followed by a camera man who films the whole story. Meh. It's unique, I'll give it that. Graphics are also neat for a game this old. Very nice setting and all.Now to the main problem of the game, besides its lackluster story: The gameplay is severely unfun...every level has you fighting lots and lots of goons, I know that this was also the case in K&L 1 to some extent, but here the enemies just keep spawning from doors and everything...you easily kill 50 or more enemies per level. It's always just shoot, go to the next ""checkpoint"", shoot some more, and so on...and 1 on-rails-session for good measure which is absolutely boring.I completed the game in 3 hours...three. It took me twice as long for the first game I think. 3 hours is just ridiculous, but I was glad it was over, because each level simply plays the same way, just a slightly different look. The best thing about this game are its gritty cutscenes and implications...but there is no real character development, nothing. Guess, that's also why there is no 3rd game...better that way, but too bad, since there aren't enough games out there, in which you play as the ""bad"" guys.			"

												A flawed, divisive shooter that focuses on a story of nihilism and brutal violence.Its unique design choices far overwhelm the flaws though.Right from the start, the first thing that hits you is its art style, which is a fully realized gritty, and grimy Shanghai. The game never lets up from its dark tone, and this will divide players from loving or hating this game. If you dont mind a game with a darker tone, with a focus on antiheroes who dont actually become heroes, this game may surprise you.From its intentionally inaccurate weapons that force you to spray, to its visual effects and sound design, it sucks you into the underground world of violence, and 2 Anti heroes. Word of caution, At 5 Bucks, this is a steal, but multiplayer is pretty empty now, and so is Coop.There is a stand alone Arcade mode but that wont last very long.Still, this is well worth getting for the Campaign Alone at a discount.

You can kinda get around with it, because the impression is that Lynch is being followed by a camera man who films the whole story. Meh. It's unique, I'll give it that. Graphics are also neat for a game this old. Very nice setting and all.Now to the main problem of the game, besides its lackluster story: The gameplay is severely unfun...every level has you fighting lots and lots of goons, I know that this was also the case in K&L 1 to some extent, but here the enemies just keep spawning from doors and everything...you easily kill 50 or more enemies per level. It's always just shoot, go to the next ""checkpoint"", shoot some more, and so on...and 1 on-rails-session for good measure which is absolutely boring.I completed the game in 3 hours...three. It took me twice as long for the first game I think. 3 hours is just ridiculous, but I was glad it was over, because each level simply plays the same way, just a slightly different look. The best thing about this game are its gritty cutscenes and implications...but there is no real character development, nothing. Guess, that's also why there is no 3rd game...better that way, but too bad, since there aren't enough games out there, in which you play as the ""bad"" guys.			"

												If ever there were a time to recommend Kane & Lynch 2, now would be that time.With the sudden glut of shooters focused on characters going mad, the darkness of the average video-game player-character, and what I see as the start of unique artistic approaches to games (see: Routine, Tangiers, etc), it should be clear that this game was well before its time.It was critically derided, despite being Spec Ops: The Line's nasty older brother. The censored headshots turn a stomach far faster than the gory over the top madness of any other game that comes to mind. The visual style is bright, eyepopping, unique, will never be seen again due to gamers not being ready for the game when it was released.This game is worth a playthrough if you want to taste blood, smell sweat, hate yourself. That is in no way a point against it as a game -- it is uniquely visceral, and we will have a hard time seeing another game willing to go so far until the critical backlash from it is forgotten.			"

												Summary of the Story :-Kane( a tragic and disillusioned figure) & Lynch(a lunatic in the eyes of the World) are in China delving into the grit and grime of Shanghai's criminal underworld.After a simple job goes wrong they find themselves wanted by every lawless thug in the city, and despite their differences they have to rely on each other for back-up.Once together they set off a chain of devastating events over a period of two days.As things rapidly start to fall apart Kane & Lynch face the consequences of their actions the hard way.****Epilepsy Warning****Once must try to avoid but overall the Game consists of :-1)Story Mode,2)Arcade Mode,3)Co-Op and Steam Achievements.....It is really an Awesome Game of all-time..Once Must Play...I mean but Legit :3 plz no piracy :3...xD			"

												Kane & Lynch are two characters I've liked since the first game.In this sequel they pair up again and quickly end up in deep trouble with various parts of the underworld, gangs and police.Story is good and gritty like the first.Gameplay is mixed in that some weapons can feel pretty useless with not much accuracy, while others are great and effective. Enviromental destruction is decent in some levels too.Thirdperson can be troublesome given the ""shaky-cam"" effect...but I liked the whole cam-corder reality vibe and stuck with it. (you can turn it off in options)Graphics and sound are good. To sum up, I really liked it but I can see why others don't.			"

												A clunky, boring, uninspired disaster.The entire game consists of running between cover and trying to kill the exact same bullets sponge enemies over and over and over again. All that changes is the look of their character model. And he shooting system is horrifically bad; machine guns will miss constantly as you fire but shotguns can pull off a surgical headshot from three rooms away. Objects have strange collision dection too, so many times you won't be able to shoot an enemy despite seeing a whole arms sticking out from behind a car's hood. It's the most bizarre hit detection I've seen in an FPS.There's no music and virtually no story either. Kane and Lynch just run around a few corridors over an over in an attempt to pull off one last heist and retire. Obviously things go wrong early on and the remainder of the game is running from A to Z while you listen to some of the worst dialog I've ever heard in a buddy game storyline. Someone made the brilliant decision to film this game as if it were taken from Michael Bay style security footage. It's god awful and make running a chore (not to mention any time it zooms in on a character model you want to cry at how horrible the graphics are).Stay away. I feel sorry for anyone who paid $60 when this game launched.			"

												I really wish I hadn't wasted my time playing through almost the entire game.Like the first game, it has highly inaccurate weapons that will mean you will only want to use the pistols or rifles when you find them, or the ammo for them. Pair this with the bullet-spongey army of enemies, and you have firefights that last forever because you cannot damage anything further than point blank at an acceptable speed. The enemies seem to have pinpoint accuracy with all their weapons, which is very irritating.The cover system is bad. Enemies will still be able to hit you sometimes, and you will only be able to poke your head up for long enough for the animation to finish before being damaged enough that you have to retreat back into cover. You will need to wait 5 seconds before popping back up to fire off another bullet only for it to miss and have the cycle start again.The camera shaking and the J.J.Abrams effects are some of the most obnoxious and nauseating graphical effects I have seen in gaming. The game actively tries to make you sick and hurt your eyes. I did not find out until an hour in that these could be disabled because they are not labeled well in the options menu.The game is around 4 hours long. I quit 5 minutes before the end because I could not handle anymore of the cheap deaths or bad gameplay. Do not buy. If you own it from a humble bundle, you can experience all the game has to offer from the first hour.			"

												Its ok for a very high discount, but not really for € 10.-, let me explain why.Its pretty uninspired and very short (3-4 hours), its one of the worst sequel of this generation, its very insulting. The story is almost non existent, many plotholes and the game is basically ""OH SH*T duck shoot duck shoot"". The gunplay is not that good and thats a huge problem because thats the only thing you do in this game. Enemys take way too many hits and its hard to hit them in a long distance. If they hit you, you mostly fall down and you have to get back up, in the meantime you are a very easy target and you die fairly fast in this game, especially if some guy sneaks up to you and shoots you in the back. The coversystem is also a joke, you get hit so many times anyway. The AI is actually pretty bad, some enemys just stand in the open or take in open places cover and civilians sometimes just act like nothing is going on and walk casually into your shooting sight. Some parts are so hard because the game throws so many enemys at you that you can barely survive and there are also stupid escort missions (ugh...), all this probably because to extend the game lengh, but in a bad way. It almost seems like the devs put most of their effort into the Multiplayer that no one wanted and cared about in the first place and also into visuals, irritating mobilephone filming filter effects and the annoying as hell shaking cam and called it ""immersion"", but actually forgot to make the mouths of the characters move when they talk in gameplay (they did in the first one actually). It also seems like they cut allot of content and ideas out of this game because of time isssius and rushed it out of the doors, there are some huge areas where you just run through and its nothing going on there. The ending is one of the biggest middle fingers in gaming i have ever seen, when you thought the game is finally about to start, it just ends without warning and lefts you with some stupid porn music in the credits and you're like ""huh? What, thats it? THATS IT?! WTF?!"".They probably thought the Multiplayer will hold this game up and thats why there was allot of focus there, but no one is playing that anymore and thats not what the original Kane and Lynch was about. It was about the two antiheroes, one a professional criminal with a dark past and one a psychopath with mental blackouts, in a cruel and tragic storyline against a powerfull criminal organisation, all inspired by movies like ""Heat"". But they threw everything that made the first game good out of the window (the good characters and what made them interesting, engaging storyline, different locations etc.) and desided to make one generic immersive shooter instead and reduced the gameplay just into ""duck, shoot, duck, shoot"" with a annoying shaking cam and ugly filter effects which just looks cool in trailers but doesn't feel good in the game. Kane and Lynch 2 improved nothing as a sequel gameplay wise over the original and made actually some things worse and the first one wasn't actually that good in the first place, but still much better than this. Where are the teammates which i can give orders like in the first one? There is only Kane, but he doesn't seem to do much and i can't give him any orders. In the first one we had multiple teammates that can revive you with a adrenaline shot for a second chance, but you would die of an overdose if you get another injection immediately after you had one already or if your teammates dont make it to your position in time. The only downside of this is that your teammates can die too and you have to revive them in time as well, that can be really annoying if they go down in a position with allot of enemy fire, but this does mostly only happen in later levels. There was also a system where you can change weapons with your teammates and give them the ones you want. This could have been improved in the sequel, but they desided to drop all this entirely instead and if you go down, you're just dead now, no adrenaline shot, not be able to change weapons with kane and no orders. In the first one we had splitscreen co-op on PC, but they removed it in the sequel and made it console exclusive. Why?! There is no reason to remove this, i don't get it if developers do something like that, especially if it was in the first one. They also removed grenades and smoke grenades which you were be able to throw and also the ones from your enemys back as well, but now we have fire extinguisher and oil containers which we can throw and enemys can throw them too. Its a neat idea, but there is no reason to remove grenades completely anyway. In the first one we had unique locations like the streets of an american city, the bank, the prison, the tokio nightclub, the skyscraper, the streets of tokio and also havana. In the second one we got the slums of shanghai, a skyscraper with an office and the airport, thats it! It was a game that had HUGE potential because of its predecessor, but they screwed up almost across the board. I was actually one of the people that waited for this game because i liked the first one allot, but i'm glad that i waited for the reviews and didn't bought it on full price. I'm still dissapointed though but not as burned as others because i had patience and waited for the price drop, this is why i'm glad that a platform like Steam exist. Later i found the Kane and Lynch 2 i wanted actually in Max Payne 3 which was ironically hated by the fans of the previous Max Payne games too. But atleast it didn't forgot its roots completely and its a great game with nice value and has a engaging storyline with interesting characters and awesome gameplay, like Kane and Lynch 2 should have been.

 IntroductionThis game is a linear 3rd person shooter that tries to look like a documentary. Gameplay The gameplay is quite repetetive, it is just shooting every guy in a room and proceed to the next one for the most part, the biggest problem with that is that the guns are highly inacurate so it is mostly spray and pray at the exception of the sniper rifle which you are only able to use it a couple of times since you get very little amunition for it and there is very few snipers in the game. You can only carry 2 guns at the time and when you ran out of ammo you have to pick up another gun on the ground so you will be forced to switch weapons whether you want it or not and alot of them are very similar in gunplay. So yeah the core gameplay is quite repetive and dull. Story The story is mediocre at best since is extremely predictable and linear like a battlefield game campaign's story. The idea was to show the raw lifestyle of people of the ppor parts of a city however it doesnt acomplish bc the story becomes rediculous pretty fast just to give more enemies to shoot at so overalll the story is extremely dull and mundane. Camera The camera by default moves around woubles a alot in order to give a sense that someone is filming the thing as a documentary but that only made me want to vomit bc the camera shakes alot and it just makes trying to aim a nightmare thankfullly you can disable that in the options menu but the woubly camera is still there in the cutscenes. Conclusion Kane and Lynch 2 tries to innovate but fails miserably and the result is a repetive shooter with highly inacurate gunplay I honestly recomend people to play something else bc even for free this game isnt worth your time. If you want game that shows the street life of a place in asia try Sleeping Dogs is alot better than this crap.			"

												This is the 2nd worst game ive ever played, #1 being Superman 64 which is a horrible abomination which also must be played. Kane and Lynch 2 is so ♥♥♥♥ing bad, it must be experienced to be beleived, i urge everyone to pick up this game, and enjoy the whopping 3hr campaign filled with horrible writing, mechanics, story, characters, visuals, pretty much everything about the game is awful. YOU MUST PLAY IT.			"

												Kane and Lynch 2 is a sequel to a game no one wanted - at least this is what the press tells you. I played Kane and Lynch 1 and the game definetly has its flaws. But story wise the game is unique as hell and has introduced two of the most memorable characters of the gaming industry. Kane and Lynch 2 looked great on the paper. They took the dark and gritty atmosphere from the first game and made it even more ♥♥♥♥ed up. The tech of the games wasn't too great in 2010 but the game doesn't look horrible. This ""cameraphone"" style also hides the fact of the aged graphics. Are the graphics bad? I disagree. Is the filter bad? I don't think so, I really liked the visuals. I also haven't seen anything like this in any other game. This doesn't sound too awful so far. Not super-duper graphics and a weird filter aren't a dealbreaker even if you are not a fan. The gameplay is unfortunately pretty bland so is its story. You have a simple cover mechanic, your cover can sometimes get destroyed just like you can destroy other's cover and that is it. The guns perform a bit weird, they aren't spot on with their accuracy but I think this is a gamedesign choice and not the result of bad programming. Funnily, the shotgun is the best game in the game - even in long range. I like the idea, because ""shotguns"" aren't the spray and pray close-quarters-combat thing everyone thinks. They are pretty precies and can shoot pretty far, but that is offtopic.The story isn't well written as well and stays bland most of the time as well. It has its moments though and I liked the scenery of this dark Hong Kong. To be real honest, Kane and Lynch 2 isn't a bad game but not a great game as well. If you are looking for a 3rd person shooter, K&L 2 is a choice and you can get it fairly cheap. The biggest point of criticism was back then, that you simply didn't get your money's worth. 60 bucks for 5 hours isn't great and the game was only mediocre at best. But times changed and you now get it for a lot less. I would suggest to go for it, if you want a simple game with a really raw feeling to it with its style and the small plot.			"

												If you want to see a live demo of how to kill a franchise or if you want to see two naked guy walking around and shooting people, grab it. The original game was surprisingly well considering how it was panned by critics. But this thing is just♥♥♥♥♥♥ It just took me 4 hours to play the game and I am already saying to myself, I can't take it anymore. 1st one had an exceptional story, this one doesn't, you do mindless killings for nothing in this game. 3/10 just for the good graphics. Spoiler - This game doesn't answer what happened to Kane's Daughter, Jenny. Lynch has turned into a family guy from psychotic madman without any explanation. He even has a chinese wife, I think devs forgot the fact that he killed his own wife in the past. Don't bother with another sequel IO, stick to Hitman and maybe Mini Ninjas. No Kane and Lynch 3 please.			"

												I spent quite a number of hours on this just to actually wager on how bad people say it is. In the end, it’s not bad at all. Without a doubt, there are noticeable flaws in this game, so I’ll push them out of the way now. The annoying camcorder effects -- which thankfully can be turned off in the advanced settings, except the constant shaking when you run -- and the abysmal ending that was set for a sequel. When there is enough damage to the head (i.e. a buckshot from point-blank range) causes a censor effect. To me, this is questionable, but when you have that chance to see what it's censoring depends on the viewer. It does have detail, such as the bullet hole down to the blood streak coming from the eyes. I guess people really did want that gruesome detail. I can see why the shotgun is “accurate” due to the fact that it fires buckshots. But they don’t cause that much damage.The StoryThe introduction jumps you to how badly Kane & Lynch are involved in. Throughout the game, they are hit from practically everywhere they go, desperately trying to make it better. Character development is practically nonexistent in here, or rather, much of their character from the previous game. Lynch’s psychotic episode isn’t involved here, not like it was back in Dead Men. Disturbingly enough, they remind me of Michael and Trevor from GTA V, only one is keeping his issues under control now. Vague conversation is used between the two, unless it’s later in the story, where Lynch describes who or what is going on. Finally, the levels are incredibly linear, the story is pretty weak, and -- of course -- it's ending is unsatisfactory. Arcade ModePossibly the best thing that came out of this game since this is where most of my time was used on. The heists were nice, ranging from difficulty rising after each completion, along with the option to select various weapons (that are named differently from the realistic versions, take the PAC 10, Kaliningrad 47, and Doretta that are obvious to spot) to the scenarios of said heists. The characters here are fine, along with the detail that differs from each other, such as their conversations in the loading screen. Even the characters in this mode have more… well, character when it’s compared to Kane & Lynch in this game! Ranking up in this mode is a pain, but is worthwhile later on, making the heists much more easier for the later rounds. The opportunity to turn into a Traitor is nice, if you want to be the greedy all-for-me type of person, or just want to be that much of an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.MultiplayerIt’s dead, couldn’t try it for jack.I can’t hate nor love this game, it really did put me in the center of the two. What does upset me is the fact that the third installment is cancelled. Not sure if it’s better off that way, seeing that we received all of these Hitman games over the last few years. Personally, I wouldn’t mind a continuation, but oh well. Sadly, I cannot recommend this game, at least in its full price. Buy the collection when it goes back on sale, enjoy the story (or what’s left in it) and the Arcade mode. No doubt the Co-op must be fun, if you find a friend that’ll play with you.			"

 2/5. BAD GAME !  OVERALL Have you forced yourself of finishing a game just to see if you get to enjoy it down the road? Well, that's what this game was for me, it's a really unrefined shooter and would never pay $10 for it, I got it in a bundle but wouldn't pay more than $3 for it, and even then I would rather expend the $3 on an indie game who will be over 5h of fun. REPLAYABILITY Once you finish this dull adventure and try to squeeze a little more of fun from it you may replay a couple of levels to get some achievements, I did so in about 35min just to convince myself to never ever touch this tittle again.  GAMEPLAY The shooting is horrible unless you are using a shotgun at close range, assault rifles or pistols at mid or sniper at long, other than that forget altogether the SMGs unless you want to save some bullets and prepare to be frustrated with the low accuracy of the guns when they are in your hands and the ultra high precision they get on AI hands, seriously the reticle of the AI is perfect and you get one the size of a watermelon. AESTHETIC The visuals of your surroundings might be the best part of the game, and that's not something to brag too much about, however the character models are bland and don't look very good, shooting cars and some elements in the environment might be what gives your heart content at the end of the day, after gunning down your enemies of course. STORY If you look at the big picture the story isn't THAT bad, but while playing it it feels very uninspired, there are parts that are really stupid and to make it worse you have to deal with some horrible animations and rather dull voice acting (the phone calls between chapters are the best voice acting you will get, I guess not looking at the stiff animations helped). In my opinion the story twists were pretty dumb, *SPOILER ALERT*  when you get caught and thrown into the garbage after been cut off by a butcher you were supposed to be dead, but no, you get back into the building and manage to kill the bad dudes with your bare hands...  that's the dumbest moment in my opinion. MUSIC The ambient sounds and gun shooting aren't bad, but in the end the score is pretty forgettable, you know, if there was any...			"

												It somehow manages to be worse than the original. This game has no redeeming qualities other than the fact that it takes place in shanghai which is cool. They center the gameplay even more on cover based shooting this time and it is probably the most generic third person cover based shooting I have ever played. The shooting is so unbelievably basic, bland and dull. It’s just bad, all the guns feel awful to shoot. The controls in this game just feels very finicky and sluggish both on keyboard and controller. They could have done so much with this setting but they squandered the opportunity because the level design is very generic and lacks creativity. The story is horrible and these characters are horrible too. Even if for some reason you liked the two protagonists in the original they made them even worse in this game by pretty much removing that tiny shred of personality that they had in the first game. Thank god this game is as short as it is people use the length as a complaint but I was just glad it was over.  I would go as far as to say it’s one of the worst games I have ever played.2/10 (Awful)			"

												A sequel to a 2006's generic third person cover based shooter - Kane & Lynch: Dead Men. You'd have think, that after a failure that was the first instalment of Kane & Lynch, IO Interactive would carefully analyse all the feedback and adjust to it. Sadly this isn't a case. While K&L2 no longer uses GFWL and allows to play cooperatively over the internet (finally?), it still has all the flaws of the first game. Hell - it even has few more.Firstly, Lynch's episodes of violent psychosis? No longer present in the game! It's kind of depressing that IO basically killed the most interesting (although, certainly - not positive) aspect of Lynch.What is also a step back, comparing to original is the music. Jesper Kyd - the composer behind music to Assassin's Creed, Hitman series and many others... no longer present in here. And sadly - a music of a new composer - Mona Mur doesn't really work. It isn't bad - it's just so easily forgettable.Forgettable is also a word, that describes storyline of Kane & Lynch 2. After the first level, everything is based around the same idea - you trying to escape from Shanghai. It's ""OMG, we have to get out of Shanghai... Lynch, let's get your girlfriend and then we go"" (*level later*) ""Plan failed... it's all your fault, Kane... she's dead... you've destroyed my life (blahblahblah) let's get out of Shanghai"". How does it end? Kane and Lynch get to the plane and leave Shanghai.Whole storyline takes around 3-5hrs to complete, which is just a terrible length for a game, where singleplayer is focal point of the game. There is a multiplayer and you can play the game in COOP. Problem is - I was never able to find anyone playing anything except COOP. And while playing a game in COOP certainly helps - it doesn't even add much replayablity (at least nowhere near as much as COOP in most of shooters).What kills the game however is its gameplay mechanics and terrible visuals. I get the difference between aesthetics and graphics and I do understand importance of artistic vision. And to some extend I do admire it's interesting visual style. Problem is - all of the post-processing effects get in the way of gameplay. With all the intense lens-flare effects, noise, color correction etc. not only spotting enemies becomes difficult. It's hard to aim and shoot. And when you disable them - you are left with nothing but highly outdated graphics, that look like something from 2003 (although - aesthetically, Unreal Tournament 2003 still looked better than K&L2)Shooting in K&L2 lacks impact and isn't satisfying. Combine that with a glitchy cover mechanics and you have 2 main reasons why K&L2 fails to be an enjoyable shooter. What makes the cover mechanics even worse is something what should have worked in game's favour - destructible environment. Destructible environment sounds cool, but sadly, you are the one that dies more often, because of it. And while games like BFBC2 or even Red Faction were able to make it work in their favor, in K&L2 it's just another frustrating feature.Bottom line: Kane & Lynch 2 is a bad third person cover based shooter, that fails to provide entertaining experience. Avoid it, if you're planning on playing alone. It can be a bit of fun while playing COOP, but in that case - I recommend picking up Rainbow Six Vegas - it's at least equally as long, has higher replayablity, looks better, has better level design... hell, it even costs less!

												Repellant and pointless.  Kane and Lynch 2 is the worst kind of bad game, one made by a developer with the talent and resources to have done something better.  What goes wrong here-and it's just about everything- feels deliberate, not the result of inexperience or a lack of money.The protagonists are utterly unlikeable and barely developed except to constantly reinforce their odious nature. The story goes nowhere, the gameplay is nothing but repetitive shooting behind cover, and the shakycam/lensflare effects are obnoxious.Mercifully, the experience ends with a soggy whimper after a brief 4 hours.  Everyone's got one game that they consider the worst they've ever played, and this is mine.  Avoid at all costs.			"

												I'd heard hype for this game, but honestly it fell down in expectations for me. Take this with a grain of salt as I haven't played the full game. Can't bring myself to play it anymore.PROS: Little to no lag in co-op, tight control schemeTHINGS I HAVEN'T DONE (before you complain about my cons section): Whole story, multiplayer, the first gameCONS: repetitive gameplay, little variety in weapons, strange camera which wobbles, very arcade-styled, not much depth.All you do is run from cover to cover shooting at people for no other reason than to shoot from what I've seen. Frankly, I could have saved the $10 I spent on this for a plethora of better games.			"

And why is gore and nudity censured?The guns are weak, and doesn't really feel like they do any damage. The story, well, I never really got it - you hunt someone in the beginning, and your girlfriend gets *snip*, and you hunt the people behind? From all previews I thought it would be about a robbery, but that's only the multiplayer part (or arcade mode).I've played 4.4 hours so far, and that's 3.5 hours of completing the whole campaign(!), and 0.9 hours playing arcade mode. I'll try to complete the co-op campaign, and then I'll just try to forget this game...			"

												If you were looking to give yourself a giant headache then this is the game for you! The game is a bug ridden intensely ugly mess.------Firstly, the game crashes for me on launch unless I'm in offline mode for no obvious reason and google doesn't have an immediate fix for this.The oddly positioned camera has giant amounts of sway. There's also a regularly reoccuring bug with aiming down sights in which your character model gets stuck directly in front of your crosshairs and aiming from cover is flat out broken.Guns have ludicrous spread. Enemies are ever-so-slightly bullet spongey. Every time I pressed the sprint button I had to go and sit in the bathroom due to nausea. 95% of the game's dialogue is four letter words. Every light source emits a strange, intensely distracting verticle bar. For much of the game there is a constant droning noise in the background.There is a story but it can be summed up as ""Weapons deal goes bad and lots and lots of shooting happens. There's also a bit of torture."" It also has probably the worst stealth section I've ever seen, though thankfully it's quite short.They must have released this having done zero testing on the product at all. It's a thoroughly bad time, has unforgivably horrible gameplay and I don't recommend it not one bit.You might be thinking ""Well, it's a third person shooter and I feel like some junk-food nonsense gaming so I'll try it anyway"". Don't. It is genuinely atrociously awful.			"

(As i'm writing this, i'm expecting a lot of hate for this review.. In case anyone happens to read this in the first place.)Kane And Lynch 2 is a good.. Well at the very least a competent third person shooter. It's almost literally like Payday The Heist/Payday 2 except that it doesn't have nearly as much depth or content as those two games mentioned before. That being said, I feel like this is still a better game than THOSE TWO GAMES MENTIONED BEFORE. Allow me to tell you why:People always complain and whine about the length of the Story in this one, yeah you can finish it in 2 or 3 hours, yeah it's very linear, yeah it's very repititive.. But at least this game has a f*cking story mode to begin with. Which Payday doesn't.. The reason why i'm comparing K&L2 to the PAYDAY series because they're so similar to each other gameplaywise. The Characters, Kane & Lynch (who woulda guessed?) are also pretty cool and brutal characters.. Very interesting characters indeed since they're sort of evil people. The game has character development, does the PAYDAY series do any of these? Nah.Also, the multiplayer mode is pretty decent if i do say so myself if it wasn't dead.It's 9,99 Euros guys.PAYDAY 2 is 29,99 Euros.Despite the short story mode it's a good game. And the multiplayer being dead really isn't even that big of a deal considering you can play the Multiplayer with AI. And the friendly AI in this game manages just fine, compared to PAYDAY. Since in the PAYDAY series you have objectives that you must complete in order to progress through the match or whatever, in K&L2 you get the loot and get the f*ck out. The AI is competent enough in K&L2, in PAYDAY, it isn't.I hope my gibbering nonsense has made some sense and given you some new perspective about this game. TL;DR IT'S PAYDAY 2 WITH LESS CONTENT, DEPTH AND THIRD PERSON VIEW.Note: When i talk about depth i mean the multiplayer, PAYDAY 2 has a LOT more of guns and other cool stuff to waste your money at.

Poor graphics quality, crash each time I alt+tab and go back in the game (fatal error), insane amount of glitches, how many time my character went glitched in some kind of invisible wall, and no way to get out of it except restart (in only 30 minutes of game), and the camera moves WAY too much!!I do not enjoy this game at all.The only good thing I can say is the overall sound quality (except gunshots) and the voice acting.

												This game is utter garbage not worth one dollar, Dog days is a doggy bag of flaming $h!%.  See the M rating, it doesnt matter because the entire game is censored, if you shoot anyone you get this mosaic box that appears.  There is NO way to disable this mosaic box making the game just feel like... a game, so theres no immersion.  Whats annoying is the graphics are great, someone took the time to make a great looking game, but everytime you shoot someone invisible parents step in blocking us from seeing the terrible violence.  Odd the game lets you shoot people but not see their shot bodies, this is something anomalous in gaming, unique to this game.  Look at the screenshots, notice NONE of them are censored.  Marketing wasnt stupid they only used screenshots that didnt include the censored in game footage because they knew noone would buy this crap.  Its time we kick out these game devs and put the marketing team in there making games, because these guys dont have a clue about game design.  Watch ANY gameplay footage, K&L2 looks like its made by an 8 year old with a video editor, it uses EVERY filter making it almost impossible to see the game at times, from lens flare, to blood over your screen, static boxes, just open up a video editor see all those effects?  Their ALL in K&L2 with most being impossible to disable like that stupid censorship box.Get Kane and Lynch 1 since Kane and Lynch 2 sucks.Rating:  0/10  Value:  $-9,999,999.00 (<---they should be paying us to play this kind of trash)			"

												of all the games i've watched disappear from steam, i've got to admit, i am a little shocked that this one still resides here. the storyline is brutal and not politically correct.it's a good game for single or co-op, once you turn off a few of the more annoying visual effects and if you can tolerate the headache inducing FOV.the multiplayer was never really much fun, conceptually, it's ok if you could find a game with human being playing it instead of emotionally-re_tarded, child-monsters who were allowed to grow up but that's life in the modern world.below you will notice some of my comments from my original review from 2010, i will leave them because they still apply somewhat but keep in mind the narrow, unchangable 4:3 FOV and the long since dead multiplayer thing.

												Despite its atrocious length (just under 4hrs on medium) and oft-annoying cover system, I really enjoyed this game. That said, I am fully aware that Im one of the very few who think this way:). I do have my reasons, however. Firstly, the game possesses an atmosphere that very few developers can match, even to this date. Its gritty, unforgiving, brutal and very realistic/life-like. Even before I got to the ending, which basically confirmed my thoughts, I constantly felt like in a 1990s Michael Mann movie (Heat, anyone?). The shaky cam-style, along with its visual effects is another major plus in my book. Immersion is simply a given, the mechanic is not violated or overused. Voice acting is a third plus, but only if you consider the two main antagonists (cant really name them protagonists, now can we). So basically, I got so immersed in the world and the perdicament that the two psychos got involved in, that I forgave the game its length, its problematic game mechanics, heck, even the (at times) mediocre graphics. I did not really dwell on the fact that the characters are visualised in a less-detailed manner, the Shanghai setting sold me alone. I will not grade the multiplayer, as by now, it is totally dead, arcade mode is fun, but given the low number of maps, its a try-a-few-rounds kind of entertainment. To sum up, if you are into gritty, brutal crime stories told from a view point of two very despicable personas, Id say go for it:) I sure had fun with them.			"

												If you enjoy heist movies and the two titular characters appeal to you, I highly recommend K&L2 for anything under $10. It's a bit short, but the pacing and style are spectacular. You see a lot of content in the 4-5 hour campaign.I don't play online multiplayer, so no comment on that.			"

												Do not buy this game. Don't do it. It's not even the kind of bad that's funny. It's just flat-out bad, the kind of flat-out horrible-ness that doesn't justify playing it even if you got it for free. What's wrong with it? Everything. Camera is awful in-game and in cutscenes. Storywise, I'm not even sure what's going on. Controls are clunky, and that's being generous. Gameplay wise it's about as entertaining as repeatedly slipping in a pool of liquified crap. Cover system works about as well as a potato works for cleaning your dishes. Half the guns can't hit anything within five feet of them turning shoot-outs into a horrible process of wasting ammo in the hopes that something will hit, or charging the enemy head on and using the ol' spray and pray. Health makes little to no sense with random blots of blood splattering all over your screen to confuse you as to where the enemy attacked from and just how much health it is that you have. Overall there's about a dozen different things to plague the experience at all times to make it as much of a chore as possible to trudge through the game. Do yourself a favor, don't play it. Save your money and buy a potato or something, whatever it is it's bound to be better than this game.			"

												This is a very short game, but that doesn't necessarily make it bad. Although you can finish the singleplayer in a day, the characters and action make it something everyone should try. I've never seen a game with such a unique set of characters that make you love them and hate them at the same time. The faux video camera style of the game is really something to be seen. The multiplayer is also fun for a couple of rounds, but it really isn't anything to keep you playing for days.Is it worth $20? No. Is it worth $5? Yes.			"

Cons :I couldn't figure out the difference between any of the weapons; I couldn't care about the story;no wow moments.			"

												This game holds it's prime with it's amazing atmosphere. The soundtrack really made you feel part of the situation and feel worried. Not to mention the soundtrack gave it a very dark feel too which I enjoyed very much. The story felt a little too predictable and has it's share of bugs and glitches. One of the major bugs I bumped into was in the last mission. When I had aimed down the sights of my gun, the whole screen went pink. It took me about 30 minutes of messing around with settings until I ended up restarting the game and it had seemed to work fine. I think it was the restart or the fact I was able to hit the next checkpoint. Towards the end of the game it'll get pretty challenging which I feel was pretty nice and bad. Enemys had more and more health and dealt more and more damage further in the game. On normal I felt like the last 3 missions were expert difficulty. So expect to die a few if not a lot, even on normal. So overall this game holds key it's atmosphere and it's ability to bring you in the game and really be embraced into the situation which I thought was really amazing. At the end of the day this game is a 8/10			"

												I bought this game last year in a sale without actually playing the first one, completed it in co-op with a friend in around 3 hours which is very short but worth it for the price which I have paid. I believe that many people were dissapointed with this game's lenght when they paid the full price.The shooting mechanics are solid and fun, the action is great, the soundtrack is great too and atmospheric.The game has a very unique art style, the whole game looks like a gritty amateur homemade movie shot by an unseen cameraman running after the player, complete with lens flares, distortions, blurs and even a shaky cam while sprinting which can be turned off. It's so bad it's good.The game has a serious and mature storyline which gets kind of repetitive.It basically goes like this:""Kane, come to Shanghai, I need your help.""A few moments and dead bodies later...""Let's get out of here!""The environments are detailed and look authentic.If I were to review this on release it would be terrible due to it's lenght but for what I bought it I really can't complainThe game takes you throught 3 hours of of non-stop action which follows the same routine: cover, shoot, run, cover, shoot, run, repeat.The game ends just as it was warming up and the ending is nothing thats worth mentioning.The multiplayer is pretty fun and a mode called 'Arcade Mode' is included which is the Fragile Alliance multiplayer mode in singleplayer which is pretty fun and adds replay value.The co-op is fun and worthwhile and may add to the replay value if you want to play with a friendOverall this game is recommendable only if it's on a sale, it is worth no more than £5 due to the linear short and kind of predictable story. But there are some memorable moments and fun gameplay as well as a great visual style. The game is like a gritty action movie, short but sweet.Good to complete on a boring night, buy it on a sale, play with a friend.			"

												So after beating the first Kane & Lynch I can fairly say that they improved a lot of things that really bugged me. Shooting is more accurate (still a little fustrating at times especially when the bullets are not going where you aim), they added hit markers to indicate that you hit them and where. The levels are drastically better designed in this one, from the streets of Shanghai to the dirty cluttered sweat shops, everything is beautifully done giving you a sense of realism the last one lacked. The variety of weapons was definitely welcomed, there were several different kinds of pistols, machine guns, and shotguns. This game encourages you to experiment with each one to find out which compliments your playing style. They improved the cover system as well by simply giving a cover button, letting you control where and how you want to take cover, its way better but could use some tightening up. The characters Kane & Lynch are better represented and displayed this time around, Kane is again hastily trying to rush to his own agenda (doesn't really contribute to the story beyond the point of telling us what happened to his daughter who we saved last game, and providing some assistence in fire fights), Lynch on the other hand puts on a pretty good show, I actually felt bad for the guy, he had his life together then all these bad events start to happen. There are plenty of memorable moments in this game, like when Kane & Lynch get sliced up all around thier bodies and they have to escape while running around completely naked. A lot of tense fire fights and action to keep you busy (which was one good thing about the first game), it rarely slows down to catch your breath, you always want to keep going and see what craziness is going to happen next. For the most part this game was really good with only a couple of issues that bothered me, one was the camera, they were going for an amatuer filmed experience, its a great idea but in practice it got really annoying and bothersome, so I'm glad the developers thought of putting an option to disable it (steady cam). Its very shaky at tmes which can throw you off because the game has a lot of tense battles, you don't want the camera to assist the enemy, so I ended up turning steady cam on. Another thing thing that bothered me was again the lack of any real story, this game is a short experience (beating it took me 4.6 hours) and there is no reason to replay it unless you want the achievements for beating it on hard or extreme. So I'm confused to why they didn't try to throw some more story, whether learning more about the character's past or adding some information about the current relationships these characters have. There is really nothing here story wise which is a shame because I like this game.Kane & Lynch 2 is a good game that I recommend giving it a shot, but since the multliplayer is dead the $10 price is pretty good, not worth $60. Playing co-op with a friend is also a great idea for a short acton packed experience.			"

												  This is a strange game, you are not a hero, in fact you are a really, really bad human being, is more difficult than you are average shooter, that corner you didn´t check before you entered the room? sorry, you´re dead. you rush in guns blazing, you ´re dead. i´m suree you get what i´m trying to say, you´ve got to take you´re time, but not to much because the enemies are going to flank you, if you take cover, and you happened to be behind something that would break in the real world? it breaks.    The story is a dark as it can get, no redemption, no happy endings, only killing and suffering, this game would have been a critical darling if it was released after Spec ops the line, because it shares a lot of things with that game, essentially that is difficult to play, because it was designed that way, the shooting mechanics are hard in an almost phisycal way, it shares is grim tone, but doesn´t fall in the preaching tone of spec ops the line, this game is an ugly game, because it´s protagonists are ugly people in all the senses, and they live in an ugly, depressing world, specs ops is a glorious failure, this game was a failure in its time, and that´s a shame, its not for everyone that´s for sure, but if you like to take a walk outside of the usual path, this game deserves some of your time, but be aware that is not going to help you, it´s going to make you sweet, it´s a game that knows what it is and is not ashamed, and i can believe how much i liked it			"

												One of the most underrated games ever made. Beneath the cookie-cutter gameplay lies disturbing and damning revelations about modern FPS games. The hand-held camera visual style adds a visceral touch to the goings on, but it's the up-close headshots being pixellated out that should do the most psychological damage to the thinking gamer. This game will make you really think about the violence being carried out on-screen. The two anti-heroes are also well worth the entry fee and their depressingly familiar descent into violence really makes you question where there's any good guys here. There is a very abrupt ending (almost akin to how the Pink Panther series ended back in the day) so a sequel is unsure... but definitely play through both games just so you can say ""I was there, and I GOT it"".

His game kept crashing with no error messages, in the end it turned out to be because he didn't have headphones plugged in. When we finally got the game to 'work' it was a laggy, jumpy monstrosity. The jittery camera and the poor controls in combination with screentearing and slowdown made this unplayable. Multiple freezes of around 20 seconds each on my part (host) and finally a fatal crash that locked my computer and wouldn't even let me force quit or shut off my computer. Never again.			"

												OK, this game is not good, I mean not good at all, at least that's what all the reviews say. And they are RIGHT, at least from one point of view. I played the first Kane and Lynch and quite enjoyed it,it had a fairly good story, even though the story was very predictable, it played fairly well, it looked somewhere between ok and mediocre it was just another cover based shooter. But I still enjoyed it. But part 2 was just bad, I was able to finish the story in some 2-3 hours and the MP didnt work very well for me... I liked the art style of the game, it managed to cover a lot of the games technical shortcommings, since at times all you see is blurry visuals and video artefacts, you dont see bad textures or crappy animations. Anyway I do not recommend this game for the full price, hell even a discount of 75% still is not fully ok, I bought the game together in a package with the first one for a few euros, which still bugs me...Nevertheless if it's for 1-2 E you can give it a try since it's a mediocre shooter with an interesting visual style (I'm not saying pretty) Other than that just get something else...

I would stick around to play this game through but it gets rather tedious to get behind cover and inaccurately shoot at enemies that are also behind cover. This game has great potential, however, when I'm nodding off to sleep because of the lackluster shooting mechanics, I'm not going to be willing to fire up this game again anytime soon.			"

You can play the campaign story in co-op or multiplayer heist mode. The heist mode is set up so that you all start on the same team and have to rob the target store, you do this by standing next to cash points which then gets transferred into your bag. You then have to escape at the getaway point where the loot is shared among the survivors. The twist is that you can choose to betray your team mates by killing them or escaping by yourself. On top of this if you die you respawn as a cop and get a monetary reward for killing the other players.			"

												Kane and LychA pair almost as misunderstood as the games they inhabit.Both the original and the sequel do not conform to the norm.They have their flaws - but despite or perhaps even because of these flaws they are valuable. They are different. This game presents a unique and well executed visual style. The weapons feel potent and sound brutal. After finishing this game I felt compelled to visit China and Shanghai. To soak up the grime, sweat and the thick, heavy air. To see the decaying buildings and the crime and the corruption. Whether these things exist in this way? I dont know, but for me this game recreates precisely what it feels to be in a place I have never visited and for me that is the essence of what a game should do.To provide some context, games like Mirrors Edge, Far Cry 1 and Far Cry 2 also had this effect on me.If you want to sit in your living room and glide through bland environments in your gucci camo yelling oorah, then leave and never return.If you want to stumble through the streets of Shangai naked in the rain, in a nightmare that doesnt end until it does :), then play this game,As with every game, best played in CO-Op.

												This is a tough one because it was too expensive when it first released but is now too outdated to really justify. PROS: -Interesting ""internet video"" artstyle. When i first played it years ago i was stunned when certain scenes from certain angles looked almost exactly like a low quality internet video captured on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ video camera..... This sounds bad but it actually lends to the artstyle and makes it a unique experience. -The gameplay is solid and competant. Can be intese depending on the situation. Sometimes when you're shot you will be knocked on your♥♥♥♥♥and forced to shoot from a laying position until your character can get up. This is well implemented. -The multiplayer is the same as the first game. Very cool mode for its time but by now probably outdated with a dead community. -Coop is fully supported and is honestly how this game was meant to be played. -Story isnt bad but isnt great. Comparable to a decent crime movie. CONS: -Outdated graphics-If your internet craps out during coop you will be lose significant progress. This is frustrating during the more difficult levels. -Run of the mill cover based shooting. Lots of games do it better. - short campaign. - ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ending. -Dead multiplayer-The first Kane & Lynch game was probably better overall. CONCLUSION: I would give this one a pass unless you are desperate for a cheap crime game or simply love these characters. Otherwise play GTA5 instead.			"

												Good enough for a bargain, but the game could have been much better. The main problem are the controls and the camera, which are quite frustrating. The control system is similar to Rainbow Six Vegas or Deus Ex HR, but both them are much better. In Kane & Lynch, you have too often the sensation that controls are not behaving properly and the camera is not focusing where it should. This never happens in Deus Ex or Rainbow Six Vegas.			"

												I know this game has its draw backs, poor controls, imbalanced weapons and its short. But for all its flaws I have played, replayed and replayed it. It is an adults game with some hardcore sequences....the razor blades is a horrible scene. The story though lacking doesnt seem to matter as the characters of Kane and Lynch are so fascinating. The action sequences are thoroughly enjoyable if you can get past the poor contronls. It is visceral and totally unrelenting, at times I felt like I need a break as it is a constant onslaught, which I guess is why I love the game. I do feel like a character in a Michael Mann movie and its  a great thrill. I hope if there is a 3rd they will take their time and do it right. I would like to mention the workmanship on the game which is shoddy at best. It feels half finished, the ending is abrupt and the central plot is weak to say the least. The controls and enemy movement are poor. I would also like to point out how it takes 3 shots to put down Kane or Lynch yet the enemy can take almost an entire magazine and still get up.... I have seen this - not to mention a headshot, bing right in the dome...and yet he is still running.In its current state it is a £10 game and worth it....if you can get past its flaws.....but nothing more.

												It pretty much sucks but: It's basically a case of ""games as art"". The visual youtube snuff style is nauseating but clever and original. Voiceacting is nice like in the previous game and the plot is... well it's okay. The setting is totally cool nihilistic grimdark where there are no good guys. Some levels/scenes are worth experiencing. Kind of like the first game, where you had on the other hand some reeeeally awesome levels and the bulk of the game was horrendous crap.Too bad the gameplay itself is infuriatingly BAD. It's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ third person cover shooter. It even lacks the distant Max Payne vibe the first game had with all the bullet spray destruction. I paid like 3 eurobucks for this and it takes around 3 hours to complete, I wouldn't really pay more than that and the only redeeming quality is the ""art"" style.It has the betrayal multiplayer too, tried it against bots and it's decent probably if you get a good group going but it starts to repeat itself after 30 minutes.

												So after beating the first Kane & Lynch I can fairly say that they improved a lot of things that really bugged me. Shooting is more accurate (still a little fustrating at times especially when the bullets are not going where you aim), they added hit markers to indicate that you hit them and where. The levels are drastically better designed in this one, from the streets of Shanghai to the dirty cluttered sweat shops, everything is beautifully done giving you a sense of realism the last one lacked. The variety of weapons was definitely welcomed, there were several different kinds of pistols, machine guns, and shotguns. This game encourages you to experiment with each one to find out which compliments your playing style. They improved the cover system as well by simply giving a cover button, letting you control where and how you want to take cover, its way better but could use some tightening up. The characters Kane & Lynch are better represented and displayed this time around, Kane is again hastily trying to rush to his own agenda (doesn't really contribute to the story beyond the point of telling us what happened to his daughter who we saved last game, and providing some assistence in fire fights), Lynch on the other hand puts on a pretty good show, I actually felt bad for the guy, he had his life together then all these bad events start to happen. There are plenty of memorable moments in this game, like when Kane & Lynch get sliced up all around thier bodies and they have to escape while running around completely naked. A lot of tense fire fights and action to keep you busy (which was one good thing about the first game), it rarely slows down to catch your breath, you always want to keep going and see what craziness is going to happen next. For the most part this game was really good with only a couple of issues that bothered me, one was the camera, they were going for an amatuer filmed experience, its a great idea but in practice it got really annoying and bothersome, so I'm glad the developers thought of putting an option to disable it (steady cam). Its very shaky at tmes which can throw you off because the game has a lot of tense battles, you don't want the camera to assist the enemy, so I ended up turning steady cam on. Another thing thing that bothered me was again the lack of any real story, this game is a short experience (beating it took me 4.6 hours) and there is no reason to replay it unless you want the achievements for beating it on hard or extreme. So I'm confused to why they didn't try to throw some more story, whether learning more about the character's past or adding some information about the current relationships these characters have. There is really nothing here story wise which is a shame because I like this game.Kane & Lynch 2 is a good game that I recommend giving it a shot, but since the multliplayer is dead the $10 price is pretty good, not worth $60. Playing co-op with a friend is also a great idea for a short acton packed experience.			"

												  This is a strange game, you are not a hero, in fact you are a really, really bad human being, is more difficult than you are average shooter, that corner you didn´t check before you entered the room? sorry, you´re dead. you rush in guns blazing, you ´re dead. i´m suree you get what i´m trying to say, you´ve got to take you´re time, but not to much because the enemies are going to flank you, if you take cover, and you happened to be behind something that would break in the real world? it breaks.    The story is a dark as it can get, no redemption, no happy endings, only killing and suffering, this game would have been a critical darling if it was released after Spec ops the line, because it shares a lot of things with that game, essentially that is difficult to play, because it was designed that way, the shooting mechanics are hard in an almost phisycal way, it shares is grim tone, but doesn´t fall in the preaching tone of spec ops the line, this game is an ugly game, because it´s protagonists are ugly people in all the senses, and they live in an ugly, depressing world, specs ops is a glorious failure, this game was a failure in its time, and that´s a shame, its not for everyone that´s for sure, but if you like to take a walk outside of the usual path, this game deserves some of your time, but be aware that is not going to help you, it´s going to make you sweet, it´s a game that knows what it is and is not ashamed, and i can believe how much i liked it			"

												Despite a five hour campaign with flaws, I feel the gameplay and the moments is quite hectic and tense, and associates with the setting of Shanghi perfectly. Its a pity that splitscreen cooperation is left out despite the predecessor having the ability to play like so. In comparision to the original Dead Men, the original has narrative that spans across multiple countries and gives it freshness and varity as the sequel lacks it. The improvements in the sequel is the ability to be knocked down and not fallen down to be unable to be revived in safety and the complete frustration of the fact that it has AUTOMATIC cover system meaning some segements take a while to force the character to take cover and thus in a fatal situration be dead from the teammates inability to be revived for example after a a handful of missions the huge amount of ai being pitted against you in open space to take cover in a low cover wont register renderign you to get downed then die;the very ability to MANUALLY take cover allieviates the frustation while inaddition to the ability to move when knocked is an extremely helpful feature allowing the game to stay tense, and not frustrating knowing you can defend your self and not killed due to the ai after getting up or teammates dead from the inability to revive in time.is it worth $5 USD / $7AUD? For me use, the gameplay changes make it vastly less frustratiing, the narrative falls flat. So probably not since it was rushed sadly... After all its my opinon, you shall do what you wish with that information.			"

												This game is an alright shooter but doesnt offer anything special but it is an ok coop shooter if you want something to play with a friend but this game is fairly buggy and suffers from an awful camera that often puts your character in your reticle and you aren't able to see what you are aiming at. I wont recommend this game as the only decent feature is the coop and it brings nothing unique to the table, just another bland 3rd person shooter.			"

												A wtf story with non stop action til the very anti climatic end. Leaves you going AND THEN?! Otherwise, everything before that will have you wincing, and squinting and shooting through the gruff terrain of K and L 2. Highly recommend playing the first one which I never did. Just so you don't find yourself like me going www.wikipedia.com now wtf is up with these guys. However, I will say that the characters of this game truely remade the idea of what hardcore criminals would be, should they selectively choose to have heart. Almost reminds me of Army of Two, without the cuddling.			"

												Kane and Lynch 2: Dog Days is a much improved version of it's predecessor.  The ai has been improved, as has the cover system and hit detection.  What stands out the most about this title however, is the dramatic improvement in graphics.  The developers really have gone to great lengths to deliver a visual feast.  At times, the natural movement of the camera combined with the stylized but detailed graphics deliver an almost cinematic experience.  Like the original, Kane and Lynch 2 also featured an online co-op mode, Steam Overlay support, and of course widescreen resolutions.  The title is so improved over the original, I would endorse this title at full price.  Altogether the game is a solid choice at full price and a must buy on sale.			"

												It pretty much sucks but: It's basically a case of ""games as art"". The visual youtube snuff style is nauseating but clever and original. Voiceacting is nice like in the previous game and the plot is... well it's okay. The setting is totally cool nihilistic grimdark where there are no good guys. Some levels/scenes are worth experiencing. Kind of like the first game, where you had on the other hand some reeeeally awesome levels and the bulk of the game was horrendous crap.Too bad the gameplay itself is infuriatingly BAD. It's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ third person cover shooter. It even lacks the distant Max Payne vibe the first game had with all the bullet spray destruction. I paid like 3 eurobucks for this and it takes around 3 hours to complete, I wouldn't really pay more than that and the only redeeming quality is the ""art"" style.It has the betrayal multiplayer too, tried it against bots and it's decent probably if you get a good group going but it starts to repeat itself after 30 minutes.

												Having played the ""flawed in everyway"" frustrating first game I was not excited to play the second. Having purchased them together for $5 I felt obligated to play them both instead of them sitting there in my library never to be touched. When I started playing Dog Days it was like a completely different IP than the first.  Shooting was about the same but cover mechanics were vastly improved, with a dedicated into and out of cover button, and a whole array of new weapons, and most importantly a story you cared about... to the extent a game like this can have.  If this had been the first game in the series I'm sure it would have been much more successful. Although it was generally panned by most critics it improves over the first in everyway.  The pacing is tight and there is always the sense of ""you have to keep moving"" or the situation just gets worse.  Constant difficult battles, even on medium, challenge you to be frantic with your movements, and small amounts of ammo, combined with how innacurate most aiming is, constantly require you to go pick up dead enemies weapons or rush out into gunfire to collect ammo. The ""found footage"" style of the camera movements (sometimes nauseatingly shakey :D) and the quality of the picture make it seem like a documentary of two men that just can't catch a break playing back on a vhs player.  There isn't some grand epic adventure unfolding before you a la uncharted or gears of war.  It's just 2 guys trying to escape the streets of Shanghai and it's all gone to hell.  For how cheap it is you should pick this up.  You can skip the first game and just play this one without being out of the loop on things for the most part.  If you can stomach the first one play it to get a little backstory.  Or just read the synopsis on wikipedia. I'd give it a 7/10.  Not amazing but a solid game worth the money and few hours of insanity.  I think it took me 6-8 hours to beat.			"

												I can't really recommend this game.I really tried to like it and push on in the campaign, but there is just some things that bug the **** out of me.- Story isn't good, but are not bad either. In the beginning it's confusing though.- The camera tends to bug and makes the game unplayable from time to time. (By not follow you in cover and by doing that, you are not able to take proper shots without having to stand up and expose yourself)- Cover system is not that good, i got killed several times without looking, no matter where the enemies stand. Oh yeah, 50% of all the times i looked i get shot isntantly with no time to shoot anybody.- SMG's.... they suck for you... but apparently the AI can headshot you from 100 kilometers distance without a sweat.- Shotguns should be a close quarters weapon.. can almost be used as sniper rifle.- It might be a 2010 game, but i've seen better graphics in games from before that time.- Somewhat boring characters.-There's no ending.. just a short cutscene with little to no content.Must say that the atmoshpere as a whole is quite dark, that's one thing i like about it. No heroic stuff like in so many games, and whole story isn't great, it's not bad either. Basicly it's just about 2 dudes who got themselves into some♥♥♥♥♥♥ but that's it.So buttom line is: Gameplay is choppy and buggy. Story is average.. AI is a bit stupid and predictable, but can also prove very challenging by headshotting you through cover. So, nope, won't recommend it. It's bad. And before you judge my review, yes i did complete the story mode. Replay value is zero.			"

												PLEASE make Kane and lynch 3! This one’s SO good. This is one the most atmospheric shooters ever made.  I don’t understand the bad reviews for this game because it is addictive and stylish and creates a feeling of tension and dread and exhilaration like no other shooter I’ve played, and I’ve played a lot of shooters.  The aiming is difficult but that’s what makes the game so unique because your shots will go astray meaning you really need to judge each weapons handling, recoil,  bullet trajectory and move to a position where the weapon can be best utilised. That’s what’s so great about this game is that it forces you to keep moving and create better angles and tactical positions with each fire fight you can figure out your own strategy. I played on the higher difficulties and it is very challenging and satisfying to think up a plan and execute it or try something else when it doesn’t work.The game is short and repetitive but that’s the only negative. It has great characters, environments, graphics, phenomenal weapon sounds, tight game play, and rewards risk taking, strategy, and creative movement in a fire fight.  It’s a shame they won’t make a third because I would love to see another game like this with more weapons, items, maybe opportunities for stealth. But really, Kane and lynch 2 is already so refined you wouldn’t have to change much. I love the handheld shaky cam style of the game and the lens flare and just the general grittiness. I-O interactive needs to make the third one. Seriously. "

												If you're expecting a solid and interesting thirdpersonshooter, look elsewhere, the gameplay -while functional- is the standard modern shooter fare: cover based shootingbloodyscreensorealannoying squadmate that gets in the line of firepress X to stealthkillcarry only two weapons at maximumblind fire and hipfire near uselesswait for your squadmate to open the door for youhelp your squadmate over the fenceshoot explosive barrels etc. etc. etc.The game doesn't even try to hide that it is uninspired, it has no gimmicks at all, the mechanics never evolve, it's just a shooting gallery from start to finish.So if you're coming in from a gaming perspective, stay away. Because this game is nauseatingly generic and wants to be a movie really bad, it has that nasty framework that people are so fed up with these days, i.e: ""corridor-shooting gallery-cutscene-repeat""But here's where things might get a bit controversial: if you come in from the perspective of a movie fanatic, and review the game as if it were a movie, this game is actually pretty neat! It turns out that it works pretty well as a pseudo-movie.and since i didn't go in expecting a good game, and just wanted to see how the game handled that striking neo-noir theme its got going on. it actually didn't disappoint in that department.The cinematography and level compositions are gorgeous. Gritty city decay contrasted against neon-spangled streets, all viewed through a wide angle lens camera with deliberate digital artifacts such as scanlines, noise, low bitrate, screen tearing, bokeh, light bleed, chromatic aberration and dynamic range fluctuations. the acting and pacing is on hollywood level and the soundtrack and sound design has a real sense of space and depth. It's field recordings of city noise interwoven with eerie electronic patterns and feverish soundscapes of pulsating drone.I personally think that it all is meant to convey the mind of lynch, and how he is hungover, miserable, confused, disorientated and detatched from reality.Definitely something to check out if you're into neo-noir movies. if you can bear the gameplay that is. Its atmosphere felt reminiscent of enter the void or trainspotting, and if compared to games i would say i felt a bit of the hotline miami and max payne mood.That's all folks!

												This one is a mixed bag. All I can tell is that it is really underated. The game has an amazing graphics with detailed environment and an unique graphics style. Every scene in the game is rendered like the effect of a shaky, entry-level camcorder, even in the gameplay. Some may feel frustruate, others consider as challenges. The game is strongly brutal, but most of them are censored. Again, not everyone loves that. The story itself is just like a great movie which is a bit complicated. Its gameplay is pretty basic cover point style, which seems okay in general. Talk about the game as a whole, some might love it, other would hate it, but surely you won't see that kind of game coming out often.			"

												""Kane & Lynch 2 is definitely worth playing, as it's unique in a way where brutality, violence and misery of the protoganists crosses the line over perhaps any video game out there. IO Interactive is not afraid to step over it. A tip: Play it coop-compaign with a buddy, it is something you will not, I repeat not forget"".As you may be aware Kane and Lynch 2: Dog Days is the sequel to the infamous Kane and Lynch: Dead Men, a mediocre cover shooter by IO Interactive(Hitman<3), notorious for being so bad it got Jeff Gerstmann fired. Really, it's not THAT bad. I mean it's pretty bad but I'm pretty sure I like it better than the first Uncharted at least. And anyways it came pretty close to having an interesting narrative. It starred two awful, irredeemable people(and not in the Booker DeWitt way where they're still cool and doesn't afraid of anything), one of whom has an estranged daughter. Like a lot AAA games this generation with a focus on story, it kinda fell short of its potential. 2, though, is something special. It feels like a singular artistic vision rather than a design-by-committee Frankenstein.Dog Days takes place several years after Dead Men. Lynch is now living in Shanghai with a woman named Xiu, and works for one of the local crime syndicates. He calls in Kane to help with an arms deal. The game follows the two for 48 hours starting when Kane arrives. The very first level involves Lynch taking Kane along on a small errand to ""send a message"" to someone who's apparently been talking too much. Things get out of hand, the man in question leads them on a chase, the girl he's with ends up taking a bullet. The man then slices his own throat. This seems bizarre now but it will become obvious why he did it in retrospect.- The Michael Mann Connection: (Director; Heat, Public Enemies, Collateral):Now Dead Men took a lot of notes from Michael Mann movies, particularly Heat and Collateral, and did its damnedest to imitate that style to a tee. Honestly it does a pretty great job at it, with the club section and the Tokyo streets level in particular evoking iconic scenes with skill. Dog Days follows in these footsteps, but in its own way. For the past ten years or so, Mann has been shooting on digital instead of film, and using hand-held camerawork more often than not. K&L2 takes this and cranks that mother up, making a kind of grainy found-footage look.That said, while Dog Days may model itself after latter-day Mann's aesthetic, it has much more in common with his 90's classic Heat. The mondo rad DeNiro/Pacino joint is about two men who can't conform to a normal way of life. They seek the thrill of The Score at the expense of everything else, including their loved ones(notice how Pacino's scene with the mother at a crime scene is more emotionally powerful and wrenching than anything to do with his family). Kane and Lynch are two men trying to reconcile the fact that their only verb is kill.Contains probably the best quote from a video game I've ever played.GLAIZER: So how you like Shaghai, Kane?KANE: It's ♥♥♥♥ed. I hate it.Kane and Lynch 2 especially has some of the best atmosphere and use of style I've seen in a shooter. Shanghai looks beautiful, yet gritty underworld, this seedy urban nightmare I find really intoxicating.Verdict:A real underrated title. I like its solid/no frills shooting and the visuals/atmosphere is one of the best this gen. Voice acting is top notch. A unique game overlooked due to poor reviews and media journalism, give this a go, you'll be doing me a huge favor! "

												Good enough for a bargain, but the game could have been much better. The main problem are the controls and the camera, which are quite frustrating. The control system is similar to Rainbow Six Vegas or Deus Ex HR, but both them are much better. In Kane & Lynch, you have too often the sensation that controls are not behaving properly and the camera is not focusing where it should. This never happens in Deus Ex or Rainbow Six Vegas.			"

												DONT BUY THIS GAME. I'd rather play GTA IV rather than this. Altough the game mechanics (shooting, cover, running ) is awesomely good, but it's only limited to that. You got strict, linear storyline, limited and repetitive gameplay, which fun only for the first few hours. It's like only a portion from GTA IV. You can only do bank heist, etc. You cannot ride bike, go free roaming, etc.			"

												PLEASE make Kane and lynch 3! This one’s SO good. This is one the most atmospheric shooters ever made.  I don’t understand the bad reviews for this game because it is addictive and stylish and creates a feeling of tension and dread and exhilaration like no other shooter I’ve played, and I’ve played a lot of shooters.  The aiming is difficult but that’s what makes the game so unique because your shots will go astray meaning you really need to judge each weapons handling, recoil,  bullet trajectory and move to a position where the weapon can be best utilised. That’s what’s so great about this game is that it forces you to keep moving and create better angles and tactical positions with each fire fight you can figure out your own strategy. I played on the higher difficulties and it is very challenging and satisfying to think up a plan and execute it or try something else when it doesn’t work.The game is short and repetitive but that’s the only negative. It has great characters, environments, graphics, phenomenal weapon sounds, tight game play, and rewards risk taking, strategy, and creative movement in a fire fight.  It’s a shame they won’t make a third because I would love to see another game like this with more weapons, items, maybe opportunities for stealth. But really, Kane and lynch 2 is already so refined you wouldn’t have to change much. I love the handheld shaky cam style of the game and the lens flare and just the general grittiness. I-O interactive needs to make the third one. Seriously. "

												i) This sequel has way better gameplay than the first Kane & Lynch. ii) Its graphics somehow, often  reminded me of the image of a typical 80's movie on a VHS cassette, they are very good in their own way.iii) Good use of interactive scenes.iv) At last, no Windows Live. Steam achievements. Hooray.a) A big con is the duration of the game. It's really short.b) I shouldnt forget to mention that multiplayer is dead.c) There aren't many characters like in the first game. Also the personalities of Kane & Lynch, aren't so emphasized like the first one.d) The plot is a bit weak and although they tried to create a connection between the first and the second game, it failed but anyway it doesn't matter that much.I'd love to watch a movie based on the characters or the game itself, but with more details and no plot-holes.Recommended, wait till you find it on sale for like 4 - 5 euros.

												Always ready for moreDespite all the badmouthing this series has received, it remains to be one of my favorite.  Dog Days drops the GTA style gameplay from Dead Men and injects it with pure arcade adrenaline!  The story is very dark and mature, with some of the most memorable moments i've had in a game.  The ending definately has a big middle finger salute to the player, but the overall experience is still worth it.The gameplay is some of the most fun I have had in a shooter.  Having the all out shoot outs in the streets or parking garages will fill that void left by Michael Mann's HEAT.Overall, it is not a perfect game, but what it lacks in fluidity, it more than makes up for in overall experience.  This is one of the only games I find myself playing over and over, even as Steam sales are going on!			"

The Developer tried to achieve this with various effects like video artifacts when the camera is heavily shaking and  strobelight like effects cause by the light sources in the environment. That all does look kinda neat when i first started playing until i started to run.Me beeing a Gamer originated on Consoles, so i am used to low Framerates and narow Field of Views.Kane and Lynch 2 started feeling ill and around the second chapter or something, after you figth trough a parking garage i stoped playing because the game made me feel so ill.Don't touch this even for a low prize.

												One of the most underrated games ever made. Beneath the cookie-cutter gameplay lies disturbing and damning revelations about modern FPS games. The hand-held camera visual style adds a visceral touch to the goings on, but it's the up-close headshots being pixellated out that should do the most psychological damage to the thinking gamer. This game will make you really think about the violence being carried out on-screen. The two anti-heroes are also well worth the entry fee and their depressingly familiar descent into violence really makes you question where there's any good guys here. There is a very abrupt ending (almost akin to how the Pink Panther series ended back in the day) so a sequel is unsure... but definitely play through both games just so you can say ""I was there, and I GOT it"".

												  This is a strange game, you are not a hero, in fact you are a really, really bad human being, is more difficult than you are average shooter, that corner you didn´t check before you entered the room? sorry, you´re dead. you rush in guns blazing, you ´re dead. i´m suree you get what i´m trying to say, you´ve got to take you´re time, but not to much because the enemies are going to flank you, if you take cover, and you happened to be behind something that would break in the real world? it breaks.    The story is a dark as it can get, no redemption, no happy endings, only killing and suffering, this game would have been a critical darling if it was released after Spec ops the line, because it shares a lot of things with that game, essentially that is difficult to play, because it was designed that way, the shooting mechanics are hard in an almost phisycal way, it shares is grim tone, but doesn´t fall in the preaching tone of spec ops the line, this game is an ugly game, because it´s protagonists are ugly people in all the senses, and they live in an ugly, depressing world, specs ops is a glorious failure, this game was a failure in its time, and that´s a shame, its not for everyone that´s for sure, but if you like to take a walk outside of the usual path, this game deserves some of your time, but be aware that is not going to help you, it´s going to make you sweet, it´s a game that knows what it is and is not ashamed, and i can believe how much i liked it			"

												Dog days is the sequel to Dead Men game, this time around you're in china dealing with some dangerous people Lynch calls Kane for help.The game starts with you and Kane being tortured by the infamous 1000 cuts method with a nasty youtube camera effect and i do not mean nasty in the good way, in fact the entire game has the stupid pixelation and camera shake effects making the gameplay really unconfortable.Also if you headshot someone his head becomes pixelated...... same goes with naked characters.It's a shame they had to go with that idea of game style, because it really does ruin the gameplay a lot.Don't buy this game at full price, not even during discounts, maybe if you get it from a bundle then it's ok , you can beat this game in 4 hours tops, with probably one of the laziest endings ever, less even if you're decent at third person shooters.

												I played through this game two times and the 6.6 hours total played is accurate (this is literally a 3 hour game.) The gameplay is boring but fun enough that I played it twice. I think I bought this for 12 or 7 dollars, and 7 seems fair to me. It has a cool aesthetic with the faux-youtube thing. Kane and Lynch has always been much better on paper. I wish they'd just make a good game out of it already. Get it if you like cover shooters and it doesn't cost more than 10 dollars.			"

												K&L2 is a cover shooter with a very good single-player/two player story mode and novel themed multiplayer modes. Its story mode is very tightly written and well-voiced, and it took me through gunfight to gunfight at a very quick pace. MP is more straightforward, but is more involved than other shooters' MP modes. All are co-op/team based to an extent, but they all boil down to earning the highest score at the other criminals' (your teammates) expense.The shooting feels appropriate, the cover shooting system is quite good (for a cover shooter) and moves at a very frantic pace. It's almost always easier to survive by moving over cover to get closer or to flank. The guns are interesting if not punchy, firing blindly from behind cover is possible, and fire extinguishers and gas cans provide meaty explosions when thrown and shot. Solid, if not innovatK&L2 is exceedingly stylish, and it received too much undeserved negativity for its divisive art design. I love the hell out of it.			"

												Possibly one of the worst shooters I've ever played and yet I still like this game. Flaws with this game include poor frame rates, poor level design, amatuer AI, lack of weapons and the main selling point the characters have very little development. The cutscenes and story aren't very good either. If this was the 90's this would be a classic. I'd only accept this as a humble gift.			"

												This is one of the titles, I wish I could permanently removed from my library. I played the first Kane & Lynch and it had something. Remind me a bit of ""Heat"" and it had the lobby scene from Matrix.This squeal has none of that. You can feel that the northern European game designer was torturing the Asian art design house with this messed up vision for this title. ""I need you 'people' to render this awful stereotype of yourselves. Northern Europeans think you murder each other all the time, are terribly corrupt and have zero family values."" These guys must have felt awful coming to work every day making the artwork for this title.After the first hour you are asking yourself: ""Why am I playing this looser character?"" None of it makes any sense... "

												Personally I love Kane and Lynch 2: Dog days. The theme of the game gives you a feeling of raw brutal criminality. The characters is like taken out of a action movie, two hardcore old timers in shanghai to do an armsdeal with the chinese mafia. But  something goes horribly wrong and Kane and Lynch ends up being hunted through the streets of shanghai, and the run of their life begins to escape the chineese mafia. The game graphics are ok, at times the extra graphics effects can be a little annoying. But you have options for that.The gameplay can seem a little booring and at time a little monotonous for some, its a typical hallway run for cover type of shooter. This game is for people that loves the criminal action hero type of theme game, and there is not a lot of those kinda games around. For me the game is all about the theme, the characters and the city scenery. The gaming critics around the world slaughtered this game, and it was no hit when it was released. But I say it deserves a try!!!			"

												This game. Got it through the humble bundle and decided to try it with a friend. His game kept crashing with no error messages, in the end it turned out to be because he didn't have headphones plugged in. When we finally got the game to 'work' it was a laggy, jumpy monstrosity. The jittery camera and the poor controls in combination with screentearing and slowdown made this unplayable. Multiple freezes of around 20 seconds each on my part (host) and finally a fatal crash that locked my computer and wouldn't even let me force quit or shut off my computer. Never again.			"

												I bought this game last year in a sale without actually playing the first one, completed it in co-op with a friend in around 3 hours which is very short but worth it for the price which I have paid. I believe that many people were dissapointed with this game's lenght when they paid the full price.The shooting mechanics are solid and fun, the action is great, the soundtrack is great too and atmospheric.The game has a very unique art style, the whole game looks like a gritty amateur homemade movie shot by an unseen cameraman running after the player, complete with lens flares, distortions, blurs and even a shaky cam while sprinting which can be turned off. It's so bad it's good.The game has a serious and mature storyline which gets kind of repetitive.It basically goes like this:""Kane, come to Shanghai, I need your help.""A few moments and dead bodies later...""Let's get out of here!""The environments are detailed and look authentic.If I were to review this on release it would be terrible due to it's lenght but for what I bought it I really can't complainThe game takes you throught 3 hours of of non-stop action which follows the same routine: cover, shoot, run, cover, shoot, run, repeat.The game ends just as it was warming up and the ending is nothing thats worth mentioning.The multiplayer is pretty fun and a mode called 'Arcade Mode' is included which is the Fragile Alliance multiplayer mode in singleplayer which is pretty fun and adds replay value.The co-op is fun and worthwhile and may add to the replay value if you want to play with a friendOverall this game is recommendable only if it's on a sale, it is worth no more than £5 due to the linear short and kind of predictable story. But there are some memorable moments and fun gameplay as well as a great visual style. The game is like a gritty action movie, short but sweet.Good to complete on a boring night, buy it on a sale, play with a friend.			"

												Despite its atrocious length (just under 4hrs on medium) and oft-annoying cover system, I really enjoyed this game. That said, I am fully aware that Im one of the very few who think this way:). I do have my reasons, however. Firstly, the game possesses an atmosphere that very few developers can match, even to this date. Its gritty, unforgiving, brutal and very realistic/life-like. Even before I got to the ending, which basically confirmed my thoughts, I constantly felt like in a 1990s Michael Mann movie (Heat, anyone?). The shaky cam-style, along with its visual effects is another major plus in my book. Immersion is simply a given, the mechanic is not violated or overused. Voice acting is a third plus, but only if you consider the two main antagonists (cant really name them protagonists, now can we). So basically, I got so immersed in the world and the perdicament that the two psychos got involved in, that I forgave the game its length, its problematic game mechanics, heck, even the (at times) mediocre graphics. I did not really dwell on the fact that the characters are visualised in a less-detailed manner, the Shanghai setting sold me alone. I will not grade the multiplayer, as by now, it is totally dead, arcade mode is fun, but given the low number of maps, its a try-a-few-rounds kind of entertainment. To sum up, if you are into gritty, brutal crime stories told from a view point of two very despicable personas, Id say go for it:) I sure had fun with them.			"

												One of the most underrated games ever made. Beneath the cookie-cutter gameplay lies disturbing and damning revelations about modern FPS games. The hand-held camera visual style adds a visceral touch to the goings on, but it's the up-close headshots being pixellated out that should do the most psychological damage to the thinking gamer. This game will make you really think about the violence being carried out on-screen. The two anti-heroes are also well worth the entry fee and their depressingly familiar descent into violence really makes you question where there's any good guys here. There is a very abrupt ending (almost akin to how the Pink Panther series ended back in the day) so a sequel is unsure... but definitely play through both games just so you can say ""I was there, and I GOT it"".

												OK, this game is not good, I mean not good at all, at least that's what all the reviews say. And they are RIGHT, at least from one point of view. I played the first Kane and Lynch and quite enjoyed it,it had a fairly good story, even though the story was very predictable, it played fairly well, it looked somewhere between ok and mediocre it was just another cover based shooter. But I still enjoyed it. But part 2 was just bad, I was able to finish the story in some 2-3 hours and the MP didnt work very well for me... I liked the art style of the game, it managed to cover a lot of the games technical shortcommings, since at times all you see is blurry visuals and video artefacts, you dont see bad textures or crappy animations. Anyway I do not recommend this game for the full price, hell even a discount of 75% still is not fully ok, I bought the game together in a package with the first one for a few euros, which still bugs me...Nevertheless if it's for 1-2 E you can give it a try since it's a mediocre shooter with an interesting visual style (I'm not saying pretty) Other than that just get something else...

												Lots of players and 'le critiques' gave this game so much s*it.I honestly didn't mind the stale gameplay (at the end of the day, a good shooter ends up on how well the firing weapon feel was executed), it felt good and sounded good to shoot the baddies.Yeah, there's a non-sensical ""Crank""-like type of excuse for plot, but, for one, voice-acting was done on a level. Plus, an interesting story is always a nice feature, but not necessarily a ""must have"" in FPS-games (don't say you didn't mind to have your fun with Doom and/or Duke Nukem with their one-liner stories)But the most important thing I like in this game is how the combination of ""sh*tty mobile camcoder"" post-processing effects, a well done photo-captured texture work + high quality of ambient sound design captured alive the atmosphere of rotting pits of urban low-life blocks. The game's really got that unique illusion (not through the good NPC/protagonists characterization, but solely by its visuals) of a having stuck inside some disgusting, but very real and alive place of our world.Could probably recommend it only in case, if you'd want to have some mindless, smoothly controlled, GoW-type of shooty fun in Chinese district.

												The game has a clearly distinct visual asthetic the developers were trying to convey. Unfortunately that aesthetic was a faux low bitrate/live footage/youtube camera simulation that didn't age well with the game; it makes the game feel like there is texture pop-in or there are glitches in the game rather than being perceived as an art style. The campaign didn't make a lot of sense either. The entire story played out like a DLC add-on that was difficult to follow. The characters are in a strange land, get in trouble, shoot their way out of trouble, then the game ends abruptly. The gameplay mechanics are OK, but the aiming is terrible. You have to get really close to enemies to land a shot. Otherwise the reticle on any weapon is too big. The weapons aren't very diverse either.The whole game can be completed in ~4hours. 4/10. If you were a big fan of the first game, then you'll probably want to play this. Otherwise there are much more polished 3rd-person shooters out there that don't try to overplay their hand in pushing an ""edgy"" visual aesthetic.			"

The characters are boring and the story is forgettable.

												As good as this game is. Steam needs to find a way for it not to crash when Online. I cant get passed the menu. Its not Eidos' problem...its yours considering its launching through steam and has been bought from steam. Fix it. If you buy it and it doesnt work give Steam hell until they fix it.

												Wish I hadn't bothered, camera view is awful, story is pooh. Last level in the airport and camera view was wrong, was unable to peak around objects anymore, crosshair was in the object I was trying to see around, swapping side made no difference either, made completing the last few chapters difficult. Would not recommend, Kane and Lynch 1 was average, this was Dog Turd.			"

												Dog days is the sequel to Dead Men game, this time around you're in china dealing with some dangerous people Lynch calls Kane for help.The game starts with you and Kane being tortured by the infamous 1000 cuts method with a nasty youtube camera effect and i do not mean nasty in the good way, in fact the entire game has the stupid pixelation and camera shake effects making the gameplay really unconfortable.Also if you headshot someone his head becomes pixelated...... same goes with naked characters.It's a shame they had to go with that idea of game style, because it really does ruin the gameplay a lot.Don't buy this game at full price, not even during discounts, maybe if you get it from a bundle then it's ok , you can beat this game in 4 hours tops, with probably one of the laziest endings ever, less even if you're decent at third person shooters.

												Before i write my rating so will i say this is MY personal preference of this game, thank you.Story: 3/10 (didn't understand much of the story exept that i needed to kill people to escape)Gameplay: 6/10 (Awkward cover system)Visual: 6.5/10 (can't really say more before of my crappy PC)Voice acting: 7/10 (heard better) Sound reality: 8/10 (as before, heard better) AI: 7.5/10 (got supriced the AI actually tried to flank me then in other games, which they just stand behind cover and pop up sometimes) Overall rating from me: 6/10And now to what i think about the game which is not a whole lot because of the numb get in the cover and shoot when the enemy pop up once in a while, and resurecting your partner. I will admit that this game is not a walk in the park as some may believe as you can easily die in this game if you're just trying to go gun blazin', which is not a good advice to do. The character per say can use a bit more character than just the crazy guy and the semi-stupid guy which just follows around for the ride. This game give the player different locations throughout Hong Kong. I dont have much more time to follow up with more of my thoughts on this but i sincerely say and hope that you dont buy this game as i did, even if you just want to shoot people for no reason in China, just buy CoD (Call of Duty) or CS (Counter Strike) instead. Well thanks for checking my rating/review of this game and i hope it will decide if its worth your purchase. Good bye and have a good time. -ZKD			"

The first game had a better story.The fights are good for a 3rd person shooter although the weapons spray pretty much and the KI is just cannonfooder.I had some bugs but reloading from last checkpoint always fixed it.

												It looked like a good game when I was buying it, but after playing 2 hours of storyline, I do not recommend this game.TL;DR: Characters (Kane & Lynch) - awesome, story - looks good, gameplay - sux; get Spec Ops: The Line instead.Pros:If you are looking for a game with good characters (i like kane & lynch) and maybe a story then try to get it. Maybe the gameplay will not♥♥♥♥♥♥you of so much as me.Cons:The shooting system in this game is weird. Recoil on every weapon is weird, enemy can shoot you through whole alley, but you miss every shot. Enemies after getting 5 hits to the head, fall down, 10 seconds contemplate if they shoud die, then stand up and run around like nothing happened. Your partner is idiot, leaving enemies to flank you from side and shoot you from behind, he takes the only valuable cover leaving you to run around in the open getting shot and if you manage to get good cover, he wil stand in your shot just when enemies are shooting at you. You are getting hit by enemies you cannot see from a weird angle even if you are in the cover. Character leaves cover when he wants to, causing a lot of situations when instead of moving he will leave cover and even if crouched before he will stand up.I wil try to finish the game for achievs, but curretnly I am contemplating really uninstalling it from my library.

												Unplayable piece of crap with broken and repetitive gameplay. The difficulty is unfair and plain stupid, it feels like you're shooting BB rounds, while the enemies can snipe and headshot you with crappy sub-machine guns from the other side of the map. Cover doesn't do jack sh*t, you'll get shot anyways, and that's pretty bad in a game which combat mechanic consists solely of covering behind things and shoot. And of course, what everybody hates, the graphics. This is like, the only game in history that eats memory to make the graphics ♥♥♥♥♥ier. It's supposed to look like it's a youtube video recorded with a cell phone camera. And it looks like it, but that only makes it all blurry and seizure inducing.

												Where do I start with this pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥It's definitely better than the first game but that’s not saying much. It’s a first person shooter that follows two scumbags rather than a military force. That would have been a nice change of pace but the story is so♥♥♥♥♥♥that I didn't care. The characters are boring and the story is forgettable. The entire game is literally ""shoot all the dudes"" it's so monotonous and the characters have no charisma which means all you're focusing on is the gameplay. The enemies will get shot 4 times and then just get up and shoot. The cover system is♥♥♥♥♥♥because it doesn't understand what wall I want to stick to and it’s really short (5ish hours for me). Just buy another game.			"

												The game has a clearly distinct visual asthetic the developers were trying to convey. Unfortunately that aesthetic was a faux low bitrate/live footage/youtube camera simulation that didn't age well with the game; it makes the game feel like there is texture pop-in or there are glitches in the game rather than being perceived as an art style. The campaign didn't make a lot of sense either. The entire story played out like a DLC add-on that was difficult to follow. The characters are in a strange land, get in trouble, shoot their way out of trouble, then the game ends abruptly. The gameplay mechanics are OK, but the aiming is terrible. You have to get really close to enemies to land a shot. Otherwise the reticle on any weapon is too big. The weapons aren't very diverse either.The whole game can be completed in ~4hours. 4/10. If you were a big fan of the first game, then you'll probably want to play this. Otherwise there are much more polished 3rd-person shooters out there that don't try to overplay their hand in pushing an ""edgy"" visual aesthetic.			"

												This game holds it's prime with it's amazing atmosphere. The soundtrack really made you feel part of the situation and feel worried. Not to mention the soundtrack gave it a very dark feel too which I enjoyed very much. The story felt a little too predictable and has it's share of bugs and glitches. One of the major bugs I bumped into was in the last mission. When I had aimed down the sights of my gun, the whole screen went pink. It took me about 30 minutes of messing around with settings until I ended up restarting the game and it had seemed to work fine. I think it was the restart or the fact I was able to hit the next checkpoint. Towards the end of the game it'll get pretty challenging which I feel was pretty nice and bad. Enemys had more and more health and dealt more and more damage further in the game. On normal I felt like the last 3 missions were expert difficulty. So expect to die a few if not a lot, even on normal. So overall this game holds key it's atmosphere and it's ability to bring you in the game and really be embraced into the situation which I thought was really amazing. At the end of the day this game is a 8/10			"

												Kayne and Lynch 2 DEFEATED!!!What a mix of bad meets good.Pros:Smooth as butter gameplay on PC. Environments look great and combat takes place in plenty of locations. Lot's of powerful weaponry to use topped with great sound effects.Lot's of shooting for the shoot 'em up junkie.Partner AI Kane is actually useful and kills lot's of enemies.Don't ♥♥♥♥ with whitey.Cons:Short. But I paid 5$ for it so I'm not complaining.In one particular stage, your ability to aim is hindered by horrible cover camera angles and the crosshair being useless. How did this get pass testing?While combat is fun, the pacing is hindered by to many enemies at certain points, bringing a sense of boredom from repetition. The drunk camera while sprinting is wtf. I say it's worth the 5$ on Steam if you skipped this game. Go check it out. Outside of one particular level, the game isn't bad. It just isn't anything special.			"

												I think I got this game on sale in 2010 for about 5 bucks or so. Even at that price, I really can't recommend it.When I first tried playing the game, I got DESTROYED by run of the mill enemies that could seemingly shoot through my cover and flank me with the greatest of ease. I got frustrated and shelved the game for 5 years. I'm not sure what bug crawled up my backside, but I decdied to install the game and grind away until  I saw the game through completion. I really enjoy the atmosphere in this game, and I am probably one of the few who actually enjoy the 'shaky cam' aspect/angles they were going for. That is really where my enjoyment stops, though. The gunplay is dated, even for 2010. It takes a ton of bullets to take down normal civilians wearing nothing but clothes. You can take cover, but you will still be hit, and when you look out to shoot, you will nearly die... every time. It took me many tries just to get used to the shooting mechanics, and I failed over and over on the 2nd level of the game, completely frustrated. I got better as the game went on, and it became easier, but not any more fun.I've heard the multiplayer is really fun, but I can't bring myself to play any more of the game after the extremely lackluster single player campaign. 3/10			"

You take damage while in cover  (?????)  , I actually DIED while in cover once. The mouths of the characters are disinchronized with the dialogue, the cutscenes are horrible (most of the time). Oh, and did i mention the controls are sorta confusing and respond POORLY?                 Kane & Lynch 2 : Dog Days has a real Grand Theft Auto vibe going on , but it loses it's magic really fast since the game was not made with enough effort and it ends up just making you extremely mad with it's flaws (that are many, as I mentioned).

												For as long as it lasts, Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days is a good game. The story mode isn't likely to take much more than four hours on your first play-through; the Arcade mode takes even less time than that to get old; and while the multiplayer options are fun, they suffer from lag and there simply aren't enough of them to compensate for the shortcomings of the solo offerings. With a longer and more varied story mode and a better, lag-free suite of multiplayer options, Dog Days would've been very easy to recommend.			"

												K&L2 was a lot of fun. I played the campaign coop. The game is done in the style of a home movie. It felt like the game was being viewed through a camcorder. 'Gritty' is a good way describe the story. Some really ♥♥♥♥ed up things happen, and that was besides me shooting every random NPC that was in distance.

The weapons were highly inaccurate, but were still fun when spraying those that got in our way.  The campaign took almost five hours to beat on medium difficulty.

												This is no ordinary game. And it is not passable. This is a creative thing. Everything from the original graphic style to the story is very impressive, very much. The game is very realistic, if you miss the point that throughout the game companions killed over 500 people (similarly, of course, in other shooters), but an incredible ride in a helicopter enters the action presents an absurdity, though, and lasts 20 minutes (the duration of the mission). Crumpled ending, though somewhat disappointing, but leaves it open that pleases! Nevertheless, my rating is 9 points, although the game makes it to fall in love  their characters, plot, graphics and gorgeous menu! P.S. Multiplayer is dead. So bad			"

												Count me as one of those who like this. Although it can get repetitive and the combat could be more involving and lethal, it otherwise evokes a Michael Mann feel and for some cinematic, mindless shooting action it's pretty decent.			"

												Production value on this game is top notch!It's a shame that it didn't do too well in sales, but it defnitely is worth its full price.Visuals take the form of a video being shot by a camcorder, and the general grahpics  are true-to-life depictions, which makes for a gorgeous scene at all times.Gameplay is typical cover based shooter, but the atmosphere while doing the deed makes it a great experience. I'm yet to finish this, and I can recommend this game to those who have played the first kayne & Lynch!I'm yet to try Co-Op and Multi player...			"

												This one is controversial, but I recommend it since it provides a unique experience... and goes very cheap on sales.Yes, the game is very short (3-4h) - but it goes very well with the intensity of the gameplay and the unique camera work.The game is presented as if it was shot from a hand - the screen wobbles all the time, there are tears, artifacts... and pixelization of victims/nudity/mutilation. It can be nauseating (I had to make a break and finish the game on second evening), but it also provides a oddly realistic feel. Paired with some disturbing scenes it can be a strong experience.Gameplay is very hectic. We often have to push forward to avoid being overwhelmed - the covers are not impenetrable and we'll often get flanked. The enemies are rather dumb, but there's not much time to wonder about that.I had a great chance to play the game in co-op with a friend who already finished it once and it clicked with the game's plot - he was playing Lynch who lived in Hong Kong for some time, while I played Kane who was fresh from the airport :)Short, but very intense.

												Kane & Lynch 2: Dog♥♥♥♥♥♥seems to think that a camera akin to one you would find in Cloverfield or the Blair Witch Project is great for an action shooter with constant motion and gunplay.  It's as if all the resources for this game went into this awful camera and at the end nothing else was left but a barely playable steaming mess.  Horrible gunplay, cover system, and every other awful thing you can imagine in the third person shooter genre is here on display like the island of misfit cover based shooters combined together like Voltron to form the epitome of♥♥♥♥♥♥  Curiousity of how bad this was is how they got my money and I feel dirty.

												Kane & Lynch 2 was not a game very well received by the critics but that does not mean the game is bad at all.If you like action games will enjoy this. It reminded me a bit Army Of Two 2 due to local (China) and because of the co-op.But not counting many prominors Kane & Lynch 2 is a game that has a story full of tension and action, the graphics are a bit different from what we are used to and in my opinion the graphics are original, I must say that the sound component is fantastic!  If you think buying this game because of the online I regret to inform you that not many people will wait for you, unless you pass by the community and ask to play with you.This was my opinion and I have helped.

												Despite a five hour campaign with flaws, I feel the gameplay and the moments is quite hectic and tense, and associates with the setting of Shanghi perfectly. Its a pity that splitscreen cooperation is left out despite the predecessor having the ability to play like so. In comparision to the original Dead Men, the original has narrative that spans across multiple countries and gives it freshness and varity as the sequel lacks it. The improvements in the sequel is the ability to be knocked down and not fallen down to be unable to be revived in safety and the complete frustration of the fact that it has AUTOMATIC cover system meaning some segements take a while to force the character to take cover and thus in a fatal situration be dead from the teammates inability to be revived for example after a a handful of missions the huge amount of ai being pitted against you in open space to take cover in a low cover wont register renderign you to get downed then die;the very ability to MANUALLY take cover allieviates the frustation while inaddition to the ability to move when knocked is an extremely helpful feature allowing the game to stay tense, and not frustrating knowing you can defend your self and not killed due to the ai after getting up or teammates dead from the inability to revive in time.is it worth $5 USD / $7AUD? For me use, the gameplay changes make it vastly less frustratiing, the narrative falls flat. So probably not since it was rushed sadly... After all its my opinon, you shall do what you wish with that information.			"

												Well... you watched Heat with Pacino, Kilmer and rest of them?This game has some moments that definlty remind me of tha movie.lots of street fighting sceenes with copes, people screaming, running around, you are down behind a car with not enough bullets, cops are in baricade, and one moment, you just start blazing the rest of the magazine on cars, glasss shaters, news stand magazines, papers are flying throug the air, and you hit gas line in the store behind cops. Ok you are now 50 meters closer to the next wave of cops:PYep, its like that.Kind of movie like atmosphere, still not 100% , little shallow, and definitly short. You can download, instal, play through, and deinstal in one afternoon.But its fun afternoon. Guns sound amazing, shotgun, on big speakers sound mighty, Some maybe will be not satisfied with camera, it is 3rd person, but still action is good.Some parts are little horror like, hack and slash etc, so i wouldnt give this gave to any kid under 16 at least.But hey its nothing that we didnt see in the weekend movies.

												CONS:- You can't skip cutscenes.- Checkpoint save failed to trigger several times.- Enemies take 5-10 bullets to die, and you barely can hit anything beyond 5 metres. It's like playing Monopoly, you never know, if you hit them, or if they hit you.- Kane/Lynch is often useless. He too can kill only someone standing near to him.- Your teammates get back or run forward into group of enemies for no obvious reason. Thanks god, they're invincible.- AI sometimes it runs at you and instakills you, an it takes about 5 seconds for Kane to react to that.- If you ambush AI, or do something, that was not expected, which is about a half of the time, it stands next to you and does nothing, or it doesn't notice you, or just blatantly runs into you.- There are lots of laughably obvious scripts.- Enemies like to teleport or spawn from thin air.- Controls could be better, and cover button has problems to react in certain situations.- Physics of throwable explosive objects is rubbery and unusable.- Sprinting camera movement gives me motion sickness. Seriously.- 1 gun on the ground will replenish almost all your ammo. Which is understandable, because you will spend half of your ammo to kill 1 enemy.- There is a scene with a helicopter and it takes 20/40 mags of rifle/SMG ammo to destroy it. Helicopter is scripted and the scene is super slow and tedious.- Bugs and unfinished stuff...Pros:+ I like the setting of Shanghai and mature theme+ You can run while reloading. + Main menu is great.Gameplay consists:1. Run into new location2. Wait for them to assume their position, don't you dare run forward, left or right, or you will break the game.3. Wait for them to peak out of cover, shoot 5 bullets and hit 1.4. Repeat 10 times to kill one enemy. Repeat until all are dead.5. Don't leave cover! Few new waves of enemies will spawn.6. Move bit further or onto a new location.The whole game is tedious, unimaginative, obviously scripted and it feels like playing whack'a'mole. 3/10			"

												This game is pretty okay and it entertains you for around 2-4 hours, but you shouldn´t spend 10€ for it. I got it for 2,5.The Characters are awesome and the story is good enough only the ending is poor. The first game had a better story.The fights are good for a 3rd person shooter although the weapons spray pretty much and the KI is just cannonfooder.I had some bugs but reloading from last checkpoint always fixed it. I only played singleplayer by the way.I hope there will be a Kane & Lynch 3 or 2,5 which continues the story  I rate it 72/100			"

												Story might be not as good as in first one, but characters still feel flesh and blood and, unlike original, it has proper gameplay where things actually work as they should. My only gripe is how painfully short it is. Well, that and atrociously bad ""cinematic"" post-processing effects, but these can be turned off in video options.			"

												I want to like this game, but I can't. What it lacked in gameplay in the first game, it just does it worse in the sequel. The only time I had somewhat fun in this was some of the multiplayer, which is actually fantastic, but here's where we get ugly. First of all, Eidos has just said ♥♥♥♥ this game and has forgotten it. When you start the game, it crashes, unless its been fixed, and I don't even want to start it again. So to play it you have to go offline on steam, or just disconnect your cable and plug back in. Thats the only way I was able to play with a friend for around maybe 25 minutes. Instead of maybe adding some new mechanics to gameplay, we just get ""Hey look, your seperated, so you will have to fight alone and get to each other."" The stories ok, but has ♥♥♥♥ing goofy♥♥♥♥♥♥throughout it. Im sorry to spoil it, but that ♥♥♥♥ing helicopter scene was the stupidest♥♥♥♥♥♥i've ever seen. The camera looks like your on acid, shaking like ♥♥♥♥ing crazy when sprinting, which is kinda cool, but annoying. The camera effects are cool as well, but it's supposed to be someone filming them on a hand held camera? The story just has dumb twists, Lynch complains about how Kane has ruined his life at one point, and they talk about seperating, but suddenly he just says ♥♥♥♥ that im coming with you. The ending is just...it basically isn't even an ending. The beginning of the game makes no sense depending if you got a specific ending from the first one, which I guess means I got the wrong ending. Believe me, the game has an ok story, but just has such dumb moments it will make you laugh and outweighs the good. There are some badass moments between them, but as said, dumb moments. Only thing you will find good is the multiplayer, and nobody plays it anymore, don't buy this mess, unless you really want to see how dumb this game is.			"

												I think I got this game on sale in 2010 for about 5 bucks or so. Even at that price, I really can't recommend it.When I first tried playing the game, I got DESTROYED by run of the mill enemies that could seemingly shoot through my cover and flank me with the greatest of ease. I got frustrated and shelved the game for 5 years. I'm not sure what bug crawled up my backside, but I decdied to install the game and grind away until  I saw the game through completion. I really enjoy the atmosphere in this game, and I am probably one of the few who actually enjoy the 'shaky cam' aspect/angles they were going for. That is really where my enjoyment stops, though. The gunplay is dated, even for 2010. It takes a ton of bullets to take down normal civilians wearing nothing but clothes. You can take cover, but you will still be hit, and when you look out to shoot, you will nearly die... every time. It took me many tries just to get used to the shooting mechanics, and I failed over and over on the 2nd level of the game, completely frustrated. I got better as the game went on, and it became easier, but not any more fun.I've heard the multiplayer is really fun, but I can't bring myself to play any more of the game after the extremely lackluster single player campaign. 3/10			"

Imperial Stormtrooper Training SimulatorThere were enough negative reviews of this game floating around to make me cautious. Yet the combination of a bargain price in the sales and the 2-player coop mode were sufficient to make me part with my money. Given what I'd read and heard, my expectations were pretty low, predicting something along the lines of Payday with a little more in the way of storyline and set-pieces.Despite setting the bar so low, Kane & Lynch managed to limbo right under it. There is very little about this game to recommend. One of the key features seems to be the gritty handicam perspective, which tries to make the game look like one long amateur video, replete with back angles, shaking and the pixelation of exposed genitalia and gunshot wounds. A marmite moveUnfortunately it's something of a marmite move, since the movement makes a lot of people feel confused or even nauseous. Turn off the dodgy camera options though, and you get to the meat of the game which is... patchy at best. The majority of the time you find yourself playing a kind of whack-a-mole down an extensive series of corridors. Sadly the mallet you've been given has a mind of its own, making the whole thing feel like a training programme for Imperial Stormtroopers. Perhaps 90% of the game you'll be standing at a corner pointing your gun at another corner waiting for an enemy to pop out so you can fire a bullet into a nearby wall and perhaps make him jump. A few magazines later and you might have cleared out enough enemies to progress to the next area, which apart from the slight scenery change will be nigh on indistinguishable from the previous section. Interestingly, whilst you're lucky to hit a barn door from ten paces, if you throw a gas can or fire extinguisher in front of you, you'll hit it no matter where it lands – even if it bounces completely out of sight!Wooden characters in a cardboard worldThat's just one of the many moments in this game which make it feel completely unpolished. The AI is inordinately stupid, which isn't unusual for an action shooter, but still jars with the gameplay. Enemies occasionally spot you from a country mile away, firing at corners before you appear, shooting through otherwise opaque objects. At other times they completely ignore players only a few feet in front of them, presumably because the scripting sequence hasn't been activated yet. The player characters will randomly call out 'It's this way!' even though both players are nowhere near the route, which happens far more often than in should. In an action shooter like this one, good level design should provide players with the semblance of freedom and openness, whilst subtly leading them towards the path they're supposed to take. In Kane & Lynch, the levels pull off the remarkable achievement of being obviously linear and yet simultaneously confusing. That's when the game isn't use crude and clumsy invisible walls to prevent players from interfering with an NPC's orchestrated death sequence.Forgettable coopOne of the main reasons I picked up this title was for the co-op mode, but this offers little in the way of variety. Many of the game's locations feel claustrophobically narrow, and apart from a few two-man doors, there never feels like a reason for needing your partner. It's possible to go down in this game, in which case you can either get straight back up again (presumably that bullet to the temple didn't hit anything vital), or you're told to press E, which appears to do absolutely nothing, as it's your partner who's the one to get you up. Even were they in a position to do so, there's barely any time to react, and some levels specifically split up the two players making this mechanic entirely useless.Clumsy controlsMaybe it's something to do with the German translation of the game, but it felt like many of the buttons displayed didn't do what they claimed to. Even where the controls do what they say on the tin, they feel clunky and cumbersome. Trying to get into cover often feels like tossing a coin as to whether your character will press his back to the exposed side of a box. There is no jump key, so hurdling over obstacles is generally limited to very specific areas (and confusingly involves the cover key). Even picking up weapons and ammo can be something of a headache, as moving around a fraction can mean the difference between replenishing your supply of rifle ammo and swapping it for a different peashooter.Perhaps this game's only saving grace is that it's soon over. You can easily complete it within 4 hours, during which time the virtually non-existent plot cleverly unfolds, going from being vague to hazy. To be honest, I can't see any reason why you would want to play it any longer than that!			"

												Kane and Lynch 2 is a TPS game that contains awsome gameplay experience.Unlike ep1, the 2 got a better graphic and gameplay system. The pixelized headshot censord is an interesting idea as a part of the system. After the main story, player can also experience the mutiplayer mode or arcade mode (offline mutilplayer game mode). Its mostly about robbery which is quite fun to play. The only thing that Kane and Lynch 2 doesn't have from the 1, is the game plot. Personally, dev is intented to make an ep3, so they decided to make 2's ending like this. However, if there is no ep3 coming up, the 2's ending is kind of suck.At the end, i will give this game 9 out of 10, still a good game that everybody should try it			"

												I finish this little gem in one sitting (6hours in total), game is AWESOME, fun to play, fuc*ed up (even more than the first), the story is pretty damn solid (and now lynch is the main star, so, even more awesomeness is ensured). Game mechanics are GOOD, period. Visuals are quite a thing, six years after release they still look quite impressive. Oh, and if you love 3D vision like me, this game is NUTS on 3d. It looks AS GOOD as resi5 and several other great 3d enabled games (the only downside? the aim cursor is 2d, so it might take a little practice on how to shoot your enemies without wasting bullets or die trying, but it's totally worth it. You like fuc*ed up criminal-heist stories? Get this one.			"

												Having played the ""flawed in everyway"" frustrating first game I was not excited to play the second. Having purchased them together for $5 I felt obligated to play them both instead of them sitting there in my library never to be touched. When I started playing Dog Days it was like a completely different IP than the first.  Shooting was about the same but cover mechanics were vastly improved, with a dedicated into and out of cover button, and a whole array of new weapons, and most importantly a story you cared about... to the extent a game like this can have.  If this had been the first game in the series I'm sure it would have been much more successful. Although it was generally panned by most critics it improves over the first in everyway.  The pacing is tight and there is always the sense of ""you have to keep moving"" or the situation just gets worse.  Constant difficult battles, even on medium, challenge you to be frantic with your movements, and small amounts of ammo, combined with how innacurate most aiming is, constantly require you to go pick up dead enemies weapons or rush out into gunfire to collect ammo. The ""found footage"" style of the camera movements (sometimes nauseatingly shakey :D) and the quality of the picture make it seem like a documentary of two men that just can't catch a break playing back on a vhs player.  There isn't some grand epic adventure unfolding before you a la uncharted or gears of war.  It's just 2 guys trying to escape the streets of Shanghai and it's all gone to hell.  For how cheap it is you should pick this up.  You can skip the first game and just play this one without being out of the loop on things for the most part.  If you can stomach the first one play it to get a little backstory.  Or just read the synopsis on wikipedia. I'd give it a 7/10.  Not amazing but a solid game worth the money and few hours of insanity.  I think it took me 6-8 hours to beat.			"

												Sure, it's ridiculously short, has a silly plot, is mostly racist, gets Shanghai right only about 5% of the time, and the cover system is so-so. But i can't help but think back and decide that Dog Days is one of the most memorable titles published in the 2005-2013 era, aka previous generation as of this writing. For a third person shooter, it's lots of fun, and as undeveloped they are, Kane and Lynch are really quite OK characters. Plus the look and feel of it is just awesome to me. Replayed it four times now, three on 360, once on PC, and it was equal fun all four times. On easy it's about 3 hours, hard is really hard so maybe 5 hours if i remember correctly? In short, good shooting action, great art design, some nice destructability in environments, and easy to digest. Get it on sale, then it's a nice little trip down memory lane. Can't believe this came out in summer 2010. Time flies faster than the cliffhanger IO left it on, and it's a shame Kane and Lynch are unlikely to return.			"

												Kanee, don't lose your mind! Kanee!Here we are, a new chapter was missing and a new chapter was finished, at hard difficulty. Kane and Lync 2 is a good side shooter that probably represent a secondary project. It started like a simple shooter, probably done under the shadow of another game (or at least this is my impression) and the final result is a fast and furious shooter that every hardcore gamer should engage. Shangai is the worst fetid and dark place ever created under the infinite rain of the metropolitan towns, and between the various clan of mafia that the player meets, between tons of bullets and blood that is spend all around the street, this game try to explain a sort of moral of two unsaveable killers. They did this♥♥♥♥♥♥for their love, they get mad for the same, and in a world full of weapons and drug traffic, probably they wash a bit the corners.Camera will move like a crazy horse to provide a cinematic feedback also during gameplay, and after a while you will accept it as a part of the story.This game is rude, graphically dark, and blood and bullets will cover the screen a lot of times. In any case it's enough playable to be bought in discount, for a week of fun. There isn't in any case the dare to do a ""Big"" title, but what you find is almost well done. Sound, scream, bullets, and environments that are enough destructable, are all at the good place.Play it, finish it, and proceed to something else. There is no more to say.Lord Hol Napult's experience: 7-/10			"

												Friend and I played through the campaign together. We really wanted to like it, especially since there's so few games these days that offer a co-op campaign.The shooting mechanics are average and slightly below average at times. The graphics are okay looking. The dialogue is mostly just swearing and yelling.The story itself is so poorly told and put together it can be hard to tell why you're doing something in the first place.The ending... it just ends. There's no conclusion or reason to it. It is literally a cutscene, stuff is happening... and then it stops.			"

												Absolute trash. The camera shake is sickening and while the ""steadycam"" option helps during gameplay, it has no effect on cutscenes, of which there are many. I don't even usually get motion sickness and it still hurt my eyes. The game takes forever to load (it even has a loading screen for quitting the game), co-op gameplay is laggy even for the host, the cover and shooting mechanics are terrible and the guns are frustratingly inaccurate. My co-op partner couldn't play past a certain point since his screen went black so we just gave up on it.Do not purchase this game. If you already have it, do not play it.			"

												Kane and Lynch 2: Dog Days is a much improved version of it's predecessor.  The ai has been improved, as has the cover system and hit detection.  What stands out the most about this title however, is the dramatic improvement in graphics.  The developers really have gone to great lengths to deliver a visual feast.  At times, the natural movement of the camera combined with the stylized but detailed graphics deliver an almost cinematic experience.  Like the original, Kane and Lynch 2 also featured an online co-op mode, Steam Overlay support, and of course widescreen resolutions.  The title is so improved over the original, I would endorse this title at full price.  Altogether the game is a solid choice at full price and a must buy on sale.			"

												It pretty much sucks but: It's basically a case of ""games as art"". The visual youtube snuff style is nauseating but clever and original. Voiceacting is nice like in the previous game and the plot is... well it's okay. The setting is totally cool nihilistic grimdark where there are no good guys. Some levels/scenes are worth experiencing. Kind of like the first game, where you had on the other hand some reeeeally awesome levels and the bulk of the game was horrendous crap.Too bad the gameplay itself is infuriatingly BAD. It's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ third person cover shooter. It even lacks the distant Max Payne vibe the first game had with all the bullet spray destruction. I paid like 3 eurobucks for this and it takes around 3 hours to complete, I wouldn't really pay more than that and the only redeeming quality is the ""art"" style.It has the betrayal multiplayer too, tried it against bots and it's decent probably if you get a good group going but it starts to repeat itself after 30 minutes.

												For as long as it lasts, Kane & Lynch 2: Dog Days is a good game. The story mode isn't likely to take much more than four hours on your first play-through; the Arcade mode takes even less time than that to get old; and while the multiplayer options are fun, they suffer from lag and there simply aren't enough of them to compensate for the shortcomings of the solo offerings. With a longer and more varied story mode and a better, lag-free suite of multiplayer options, Dog Days would've been very easy to recommend.			"

												At the risk of sounding like a rant, I'll like to begin with saying that there were a few elements in this game that I found attractive - especially with playing the first game by Square.  Now the beginning of this sequel had a lot of promise with it's cinematic feel and it's very realistic atmosphere - you feel like you're getting dragged into the game and caring for it's characters.  Unfortunately, this honeymoon period ends rather quickly with a very uninspired cover-shooter with a lack of fresh mechanics.  In trying to maintain realism, the game lacks any actual boss battles but this just means the gameplay is dampered by repeatedly shooting waves upon waves of generic enemies.  The camera becomes a problem in this thirdperson shooter - especially on cover mechanics where it won't shift over the left shoulder correctly at times and putting your avatar smack in the middle of the screen.  The hollywood-esque shaky camera is used often even when you begin sprinting which doesn't heighten the experience or make the action more frantic, it's just a cheap trick that invokes dizziness/confusion.Now the main focus of this game is the story - unfortunately it's like a hollowed out action movie's plot where it begins with some buildup then quickly deteriorates into ""NOOOOOOOOOOO"" territory.  The villians become one-offs that should just be dispatched like the hundreds of other faceless mooks rushing at you. The inbetween level voiceovers lose their charm after a few levels and 12 chapters later the game just abruptly ends with a credit screen into a return to the main menu and no actual closure.The game had the high production values (for it's time) and the potential to be much bigger but unfortunately it falls short in my book and I couldn't recommend it to others unless they were real fans of the first game and wanted to see a continuation.

												I can't really recommend this game.I really tried to like it and push on in the campaign, but there is just some things that bug the **** out of me.- Story isn't good, but are not bad either. In the beginning it's confusing though.- The camera tends to bug and makes the game unplayable from time to time. (By not follow you in cover and by doing that, you are not able to take proper shots without having to stand up and expose yourself)- Cover system is not that good, i got killed several times without looking, no matter where the enemies stand. Oh yeah, 50% of all the times i looked i get shot isntantly with no time to shoot anybody.- SMG's.... they suck for you... but apparently the AI can headshot you from 100 kilometers distance without a sweat.- Shotguns should be a close quarters weapon.. can almost be used as sniper rifle.- It might be a 2010 game, but i've seen better graphics in games from before that time.- Somewhat boring characters.-There's no ending.. just a short cutscene with little to no content.Must say that the atmoshpere as a whole is quite dark, that's one thing i like about it. No heroic stuff like in so many games, and whole story isn't great, it's not bad either. Basicly it's just about 2 dudes who got themselves into some♥♥♥♥♥♥ but that's it.So buttom line is: Gameplay is choppy and buggy. Story is average.. AI is a bit stupid and predictable, but can also prove very challenging by headshotting you through cover. So, nope, won't recommend it. It's bad. And before you judge my review, yes i did complete the story mode. Replay value is zero.			"

The cutscenes and story aren't very good either. If this was the 90's this would be a classic. I'd only accept this as a humble gift.			"

'Gritty' is a good way describe the story. Some really ♥♥♥♥ed up things happen, and that was besides me shooting every random NPC that was in distance. Some of those pedestrians and baggage handlers did manage to run to safety. Those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. The combat is mostly satisfying. The weapons were highly inaccurate, but were still fun when spraying those that got in our way.  The campaign took almost five hours to beat on medium difficulty.

The game is very realistic, if you miss the point that throughout the game companions killed over 500 people (similarly, of course, in other shooters), but an incredible ride in a helicopter enters the action presents an absurdity, though, and lasts 20 minutes (the duration of the mission). Crumpled ending, though somewhat disappointing, but leaves it open that pleases!

Lynch really felt like he was a psycopath in the original, now he's just angry all the time for seemingly no reason. Even the co-op is dulled, the first game had a ton of nice touches and differences in perspective for each character, this time all we have is two areas where you briefly split up. Maybe get it on sale if you have a buddy to play it with, but otherwise avoid. Also FYI the multiplayer is RIP.			"

												Kanee, don't lose your mind! Kanee!Here we are, a new chapter was missing and a new chapter was finished, at hard difficulty. Kane and Lync 2 is a good side shooter that probably represent a secondary project. It started like a simple shooter, probably done under the shadow of another game (or at least this is my impression) and the final result is a fast and furious shooter that every hardcore gamer should engage. Shangai is the worst fetid and dark place ever created under the infinite rain of the metropolitan towns, and between the various clan of mafia that the player meets, between tons of bullets and blood that is spend all around the street, this game try to explain a sort of moral of two unsaveable killers. They did this♥♥♥♥♥♥for their love, they get mad for the same, and in a world full of weapons and drug traffic, probably they wash a bit the corners.Camera will move like a crazy horse to provide a cinematic feedback also during gameplay, and after a while you will accept it as a part of the story.This game is rude, graphically dark, and blood and bullets will cover the screen a lot of times. In any case it's enough playable to be bought in discount, for a week of fun. There isn't in any case the dare to do a ""Big"" title, but what you find is almost well done. Sound, scream, bullets, and environments that are enough destructable, are all at the good place.Play it, finish it, and proceed to something else. There is no more to say.Lord Hol Napult's experience: 7-/10			"

												I like this game. It felt meta towards the end, a comment on video games in general. The entire time I listened to Kane and Lynch both complain about the game, the killing, the mindless drudgery and the feeling of ""one last job"" I felt the same. The gameplay is terrible, I fought to the end of each mission, massacring police and gang members to do the same in the next area. To do the same in the next. Then the next. Rarely mixing it up with an escort mission or turret segment.Towards the end the pair orally ask when it will end multiple times, pleading for it to be over and I started to feel the same. Relief at the end of a mission, a sigh at the beginning of the next. ""When will it end?"" shouted Lynch, as he prepared to fight yet another wave of Shanghai's police.Three and a half hours from the beginning, a cut to black and the end of the game where I felt relief the same as Kane and Lynch. It was over. There was no triumph, no lessons learnt, and no achievements; just a temporary escape until the next game. I think that was intentional, an artistic move on the part of the IO Interactive to induce the same feeling that the pair go through on missions, to highlight something about video games and gaming culture.That said, I still can't recommend it because it's three hours of shooting down corridors at waves of enemies. Artistic statements and interpretations only really end up working in games when the gameplay is good in the first place. This was a massive chore from start to finish.			"

												Absolute trash. The camera shake is sickening and while the ""steadycam"" option helps during gameplay, it has no effect on cutscenes, of which there are many. I don't even usually get motion sickness and it still hurt my eyes. The game takes forever to load (it even has a loading screen for quitting the game), co-op gameplay is laggy even for the host, the cover and shooting mechanics are terrible and the guns are frustratingly inaccurate. My co-op partner couldn't play past a certain point since his screen went black so we just gave up on it.Do not purchase this game. If you already have it, do not play it.			"

												I vaguely remember the original Kane & Lynch being something of a mediocre shooter, mostly written off for being uninspiring with unrelatable protagonists. So when ""Dog Days"" came out, and the reviews trashed it for being nauseatingly bad, I felt no strong urge to pick it up. Then Eidos had that massive Steam-Bundle and both games were sort of shoved in there,which is how they ended up in my library. I feel like I specifically need to point this out, I did not go out of my way to get this game. It was essentially just a freebie that I decided to check out to see if it was as bad as everyone seemed to think it was.I kept an open mind and fired it up. First thing that struck me was the absolutely nauseating camera. That's not hyperbole either, the god awful ""found footage"" style wobble was so bad I felt physically ill. This is the first and only game that has ever had that effect on me, by the way, I typically don't get nauseous from bad camera work. Second thing I noticed was the audio engineering was all sorts of broken. Bad repetitive gunshots, weird ambient noise and a cacophony of shouts and screams made every waking moment playing this feel like an assault on your ears. It never let up except during the loading screens, and then the effect was is so jarring you feel like you experienced whiplash.The graphics are passable, for a PS3 port. There were minor issues of pop-ins and screen tearing, but otherwise it was fine. Overall the mood was they were aiming for was dark and grungy, and I suppose they did alright at that.The gameplay is probably the worst aspect of the Dog Days. All you'll be doing, from the minute you start until the final cutscene is third person running and gunning, broken up in only one area where you're stuck in a fixed position shooting out of a vehicle. Occasionally they will insinuate that you are supposed to be engaging the enemy from stealth, but I never seemed to be able to sneak up on anyone, the enemy always seemed to detect you, no matter how slowly you moved past them.When it comes to the cover based shooting mechanic, they manage to somehow mess up the two most fundamental aspects of the gameplay style. The shooting, and the cover.Sticking to cover, never seems to really shield you all that much from enemy fire, and you can't aim your gun to save your life. The targeting reticle is always so massive, and the firearms so inaccurate it feels like you are constantly blind-firing from the hip. I swear at one point I unloaded an entire SMG on an enemy no more then 10 meters away from me without any effect.Couple this with the fact that the enemies soak bullets like sponge does water and the main... no, check that, SOLE gameplay becomes an exercise in frustrating tedium.The plot to this game is fairly threadbare as well. Kane and Lynch meet up in Shanghai to sell guns and murder people, only they murder the wrong people and now they are being hunted. Lynch has a girlfriend, she gets killed, he goes nuts, badguy gets killed, and the credits come rolling down in what was such a startling surprise I actually laughed out loud.You can see that the time I spent playing this game was just over three and a half hours. That's how long it took me to complete the single player storyline. I didn't even consider checking out the multiplayer aspect.So yeah, avoid this game, unless you are morbidly curious about just how bad it is.			"

Game mechanics are GOOD, period. Visuals are quite a thing, six years after release they still look quite impressive. Oh, and if you love 3D vision like me, this game is NUTS on 3d. It looks AS GOOD as resi5 and several other great 3d enabled games (the only downside? the aim cursor is 2d, so it might take a little practice on how to shoot your enemies without wasting bullets or die trying, but it's totally worth it.

												Kane and Lynch 2 is a TPS game that contains awsome gameplay experience.Unlike ep1, the 2 got a better graphic and gameplay system. The pixelized headshot censord is an interesting idea as a part of the system. After the main story, player can also experience the mutiplayer mode or arcade mode (offline mutilplayer game mode). Its mostly about robbery which is quite fun to play. The only thing that Kane and Lynch 2 doesn't have from the 1, is the game plot. Personally, dev is intented to make an ep3, so they decided to make 2's ending like this. However, if there is no ep3 coming up, the 2's ending is kind of suck.At the end, i will give this game 9 out of 10, still a good game that everybody should try it			"

I think that was intentional, an artistic move on the part of the IO Interactive to induce the same feeling that the pair go through on missions, to highlight something about video games and gaming culture.That said, I still can't recommend it because it's three hours of shooting down corridors at waves of enemies. Artistic statements and interpretations only really end up working in games when the gameplay is good in the first place. This was a massive chore from start to finish.			"

												The game isnt as bad as it looks , the graphics are decent and it has interesting story .The problems too many lights, too many camera shakes, ending is garbage, and its too short.Overall 6.5 scoreAt first this game looks weak but it gets better going deeper in the gameThis is how much it took to finish this game !!!!!!!!!!!!

												This game is... unique. It's not 8/10 good, not even 7 in most eyes. But I consider this game an experience.The visuals  always gave me this weird vibe that I was constantly under threat, which kept me on my toes throught. There are this camera blur and pixelization efects on the whole game, and most peole complain about them, but you can turn them off. There is a big enphasis in cover combat, but that indescreptible feeling that it's you aganst the world kept me playing.  It's short, about 6 hours, but it's also cheap. I recomend it still for the scale of the game and the constant tension in the atmosphere.By the way, the visuals in the beginning...haunting.			"

												This game has good visuals that can create good atmosphere and improve game immersion. Talking about core gameplay quality this is surely not the best third person shooter out there, moves are very basic, gameplay lacks in some mechanics. In my opinion it is not worth the regular store price, buy it on sale.			"
