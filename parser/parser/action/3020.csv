												In the series, Call of Juarez has to be the best one, Techland did a good job portraying the old western theme,the guns feel good, and you have the freedom to either use one revolver, akimbo two of them, use different kinds of two handed weapons like  shotguns, saw-offs, rifles, OR! you could be a badass and read the bible while you shoot bandits. And talking about being a badass, the main protagonist - Reverend Ray, voiced by Marc Alaimo who did not just a great work, but one of the major points why I simply LOVE the game, not to mention that the story itself teaches you important lessons.Overall the game is great for its age(2006) and I highly recommend it to try it10/10			"

												By video games standard, this is an old game.  However, the atmosphere, the voice acting, the action, the gameplay and the storyline all come together to make a great western.  Techland, creators of Dead Island and the Call of Juarez series, offer a wonderful graphical experience.  There are some little issues here and there with the game.  I had my share or horseriding issues, or the strange sneaking ability that doesn't always work.  As a whole, great game, and I highly recommend it to those who want to play a good Western style game.  Just be aware, this game is not easy.  Even on easy, the game will make replay the same mission again and again.  Sometimes the autosave feature is too far between saves, so make sure to save your game often.  Restarting a mission just before an autosave and having to do the whole thing again is very frustrating.			"

												I'm crouched, hiding in a bush. I see my enemy, but he doesn't see me, yet. I draw my bow back, slow my breathing, aim center mass, & let the arrow fly. He goes down with a groan. I slowly exit my hide & creep over to the body, making sure not to alert any nearby enemies I haven't spotted. I retrieve my arrow, which has pinned his forearm to his chest. Great FPS Wild West style! This is NOT an easy game, even on easiest difficulty. You can run 'n gun, but that tactic will only get you so far. Some parts require stealth, which adds to the difficulty, but also the fun. And yes, you can retrieve your arrows!The GoodGood character development, decent story, loads of authentic weapons from the time period (and a few not-so-authentic), fun to play, horse riding sim, horse thief simNice little detail: firearms will blow up in your hand if they overheat, causing injuryThe BadCompared to other FPS's, certain parts of this game are very difficult, although pretty realistic. This may not be such a bad thing, though. Using the whip to ascend, swing, jump, then cling to an outcropping can be tricky & frustrating, but can be very useful to get above your enemies, especially in a canyon setting.The UglyHaving to pick up boxes and drop them in order to climb up/over things is a pain which looks and feels clunky. When you quick save, everything freezes for like 10 seconds (gameplay, music, SFX), which kind of detracts from the immersive first person environment.10/10 The best horse thief sim I've ever played!

This review is a little lengthy, so if you just want a quick summary of why I recommend Call of Juarez skip the Results and read from there.Techland starts the series with the epic western mystery action adventure. Call of Jaurez draws you in to a world of hardship and torment that plagues the old west. In particularly how racism and corruption of the older days impacted the life of Billy Candle, a young man. Story:Call of Juarez is a Western style action game. The story is incredibly interesting, but honestly takes a while to get into. Call of Juarez is a western mystery surrounding the story of the gold of Juarez. The story surrounds the protagonist Billy Candle, a boy without a father, from the little town of Hope (an ironic name). Billy ends up being caught up in a mystery of whether he may or may not have murdered his parents. The death of Billy’s parents and the prejudice of the Hope forces Billy to go on the lamb. Reverend Ray, brother to Billy’s mother’s lover, hunts Billy for this crime. In order to start a new life Billy is set for Juarez, but will Reverend Ray catch him?Campaign:In the campaign you play both Billy and Ray throughout. Billy as he is on the lamb and the Reverend as he hunts him down. There are fifteen chapters to the game, and they only become longer as you progress further. Each chapter begins with a dialogue read either by Billy or Ray. The story is rather gripping, but I didn't start really caring much about the characters until about Chapter VII. The game has some levels that are incredibly long, while others than are very short. I would recommend saving a lot during the game as for me the Auto-Save feature did not work. What is most interesting is how the levels are designed; some of them are essentially open world while others are pathways. For an older game, 2006, the levels can be quite expansive and rather innovative. Some of these levels will require you to solve puzzles, other will require you to complete tasks, but most the time you will just be running and gunning like a madman. Gameplay:Once you’ve mastered the basic mechanics of the game there is not much more too it. Billy Candle should always use the Bow and Arrow as it causes time to slow for him. While Reverend Ray should always quick draw as it causes time to slow for him. There are many different types of weapons, but you will notice that as the game progresses they are all essentially the same and pistols with quick reload are always the best bet. Rifles win over shotguns, because you will never be close to enemies that need a big dose of Lead (Pb). And on the incredibly rare occasion you find one, a scoped rifle is the best gun. The weapons break over time, so you will be constantly throwing away your guns and essentially selecting the same ones.  The movement is rather clunky, but for a 2006 title it does a good job. If you are interested in getting into Call of Juarez series (although I have not played Bound in Blood) Gunslinger is a completely different game with no references to the original. So you could start wherever you want and just work your way back to this one.Hints:>Despite there being many interesting and cool guns, they all do the same basic damage and essentially there is no reason to use anything other than the Quick Reload weapons and the Bow. >Just remember with Reverend Ray you can always quick draw, just put away your guns, wait a few moments, and then right click your mouse.Difficulty Problems:I beat this game on Medium Difficulty, but I would say I was really upset I couldn't play it on Hard Difficulty. I wanted to, but the first episode where you had to run away from the rain of bullets was essentially impossible, so because of that one annoying part I had to play the whole game on medium. Results:If you like Westerns, you can get past the mechanics/graphics of older generation games, and are interested in an epic adventure then this is the game for you. The game presents a lot of challenges, mystery, character development, open world environments, and combat. The game was incredibly easy and I never was really posed with a single challenge, although a lack of challenge just makes the game seem like a 80s action movie. Call of Jaurez is a fun game coupled with a fantastic campaign. I recommend Call of Jaurez, especially if you can get it for a good sale. Pros:+Interesting story, characters and level design.+Nice variety of weapons (despite you only ever really using one type of them)+No limit to “Quick Draw” Ability+A long campaign that requires a variety of tactics and battle types.+Being able to swing with your whip from tree to tree.Cons:-My game glitched making me unable to finish the final scene, but you can easily watch it online (despite it not being as gratifying as completing it yourself). -The game can take a while to load even though its an old game.-The dialogue at the beginning of each episode is read incredibly slow-The guns lose duration and break, which is incredibly annoying as some weapons, like the scoped rifle, are near impossible to find.-Some of the levels are so big you find yourself running between zones for a couple minutes with no enemies.

												Call of Juarez is one of those games already fading from memory. Solid shooting mechanics mix with poor level design while potentially interesting protagonists are bludgeoned with ho-hum enemies. Sadly some of the game's signature features, such as the slow-motion focus shooting, are hugely overused and actually drag the game down.Call of Juarez's plot unfolds from each of two character perspectives. The first, Billy, is a worthless do-nothing that finds himself wandering back home after years of searching for the mythical treasure of Juarez.He's an entirely annoying character in spirit and nearly all of the levels designed for him involve some sort of sneaking or rock climbing expedition, which only compounds the issue.he second character, Reverend Ray, is a preacher with a dark past that has actively been seeking redemption through prayer and church. When his brother is killed, supposedly by Billy, his more violent side pushes to the front again as he begins the chase for righteous vengeance across the wild, slaughtering any wicked men in his way. The violent road eventually leads to unfortunate consequences as Revered Ray's convictions and faith are turned upside down. Both characters are given skills to help differentiate their styles of play, Ray being the run and gun and Billy being the sneak about, but the techniques aren't necessarily welcome.One of the game's more interesting features, called concentration mode, also ends up being one of the game's worst enemies. When activated, time will slow down for Ray after drawing his guns. The recharge time on Ray's ability is too fast, allowing you to simply wait and use it over and over. Having a special ability like this should actually be special rather than standard.While the special focus ability is optional, the levels, unfortunately, are not.  The corridor shooter sections with Reverend Ray running point aren't necessarily all bad. Running and gunning through an Old West town is fun. But corridor shooting can only get you so far these days. Even worse are the levels with jumping puzzles and whip swinging. Visually Call of Juarez is decent enough though it won't win any awards. It looked pretty good when it was originally announced, but these days it's mid-range at best. Character models, faces particularly, are the best the game has to offer. Environments are blocky and offer up some strange texturing creating passable play areas. Multiplayer also has its moments, though most of them are more cheap thrills than deep gaming. Call of Juarez might appeal to you, but it's not the Wild West fun I was hoping for.			"

												This game is nearly ten years old, I'm not going to lie to you, it's aged. Not in a good way like a wine either. The Good:The first person shooter mechanics work well, though they do feel like an older style. This game tends to be ""run and gun"", think Quake, but perhaps a little more tactical. The enemy AI don't exactly outwit you, although, do they ever in a first person shooter? The combat is surprisingly fun, and the bullets feel surprisingly real. You get shot in the head with a rifle in real life, chances are you're ♥♥♥♥ed. You get shot in the head with a rifle in Call of Juarez? Chances are... you're ♥♥♥♥ed. Don't get me wrong though, this is no Dark Souls. The combat can be challenging (at least I found it so on normal difficulty), but you're not going to be repeating fights over and over again. The story on offer whilst not ground-breaking is what any Western fan would like. You've got fabelled treasure, Mexicans, a Native American who offers spiritual guidance, and of course vengance.The Bad: The voice acting in this game is average as hell. In particular the main character sounded so false I'm convinced that I myself could portray a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Mexican better. The Preacher's voice on the otherhand was pretty bad ♥♥♥, so not too many points lost here.The Ugly:The graphics like the rest of the game are close to 10 years old. They're pretty gross and the textures lack diversity. That being said, you probably can't find any other game of this age that has aged any better. The graphics are still at a level where gameplay isn't a blurred mess, all the main characters look distinct and that's good enough for me! Conclusion:Do you love Westerns? Do you like feeling love you're a cowboy? Can you tolerate a dated game? If you're answer is yes to these, this games worth picking up.Do you love high res textures? Do you love high quality voiceacting? Do you hate dated mechanics?If you're answer is yes to these, don't bother. Get down to gamestop for the latest and greatest Assassins of Duty III - Escape to Africa  :^)My personal score: 8/10, looking forward to picking up the sequel.			"

												Rating 6.5/10 Overview: First Person ShooterThe Good+ Graphics look great especially outdoor environments. + I love the western frontier setting. + The story and characters are really well done. The story is told over the course of 15 levels switching between two characters and retelling certain events from different perspectives. + Good soundtrackThe Average:Controls and animation feel stiff and cumbersome. There are times when you can jump and grab a ledge easily and other times you are not allowed to jump over a knee high barricade because the game designers don't want you going a certain way.  The game features stealth sections every once in a while to break up the gameplay. Although its nice to have a change of pace, these stealth sections are average at best. Enemies will sometimes spot you a mile away while other times you can crouch right in front of them. Worse, if you do get spotted you have to replay the entire section over again, granted they are not very long but still frustrating none the less. Shooting mechanics are average. Guns have no weight or feel to them, have poor accuracy and often times gets pretty frustrating to get through certain sections. The bad- While the graphics are good, especially the outdoor environments, textures and character models are bad. - The last main mission has respawning enemies making for a very frustrating experiences causing you to abuse quick save/load to get by certain sections- game crashed a few timesConclusionAlthough a very average game by today's standards I still think its worth checking out even at a discounted price. Strangely enough the outdoor environments are really the best thing this game has to offer.   "

												I completed the game a week ago, so while my memories of this game are still fresh I'll write a review.What I gotta say first, I love western games and overall I liked Call of Juarez. This game is pretty old now and there are some problems with this game, but I still liked it very much and I recommend it to everybody who likes western theme.First, let's talk about the good things. What I especially liked is the atmosphere, soundtrack and the story (except for this terrible final ending scene). You know, there are some games that keeps you interested in the story from the beginning and till the end. Call of Juarez is one of those. About the gameplay - we have 2 playable characters with different playstyles. When you play Reverend Ray its your classical FPS, where you shoot your enemies using rifles, shotguns, dual pistols and stylish slowmotion ability. When you play as Billy Candle, prepare for some stealth and lasso swinging (both are extremely unpolished, but you will get used to them after some time). Actually Billy's missions can be frustrating at first, but when you get used to them, they will not be a problem. Unfortunately there are plenty of bugs in the game, I've had some funny ones with people stuck in the walls etc. Weapon variety is not impressive either. But anyway, the game is decent, and you should try it.VERDICT: There are some problems, unpolished stuff and bugs in the game, but captivating story, decent soundtrack, ""dark atmpsphere"" and Reverend Ray, who is a total badass makes this game worthy of your attention. I honestly didn't like it at first, but the more I played, the more interested I was. If you don't like western setting, maybe you won't like it. But if you do, this is a must.My personal rating for the game is 7.5/10			"

												Basic facts: A western story-focussed FPS game with two stories running side by side, crossing over and twisting around together. About 8 hours worth of gameplay, with many interesting and innovative features, including some way ahead of their time.CoJ is a rather good game as games go. The story covers Reverend Ray on one side, and Billy Candle on the other. Ray's gameplay in rather combat heavy, with lots of gunplay. Billy's story is more stealth focussed, with a bullwhip for mobility and a bow for stealth/long range combat. If the game had an unremarkable story, its gameplay would earn it a decent enough review.But the story is where this game stands out. Without revealing anything or putting up any spoilers, it features two awesome characters who you genuinely begin to feel for at various points in the story. The first 2 thirds of the story set what would appear to be a set in stone atmosphere, but this changes in dramatic fashion. One of few games which would make a good movie.Well worth playing for anybody who appreciates a fantastic story. If you just want a western shoot 'em up, Dead Man's Hand is a better alternative of similar age.  "

												I actually got really surprised after playing Call of Juarez, I didn't knew what to expect but the game exceeded my expectations. Despite the outdated graphics which might put some people off, but please do consider it's a game from 2006, and the performance issues I had I actually really enjoyed my time with it. Call of Juarez lets you play as two different characters and both play an important role on the plot which I found out to be rather interesting but, of course, that depends from person to person. The two things I most enjoyed about Call of Juarez was probably the soundtrack which sets you in the right western mood as you play and the gun handling, I actually was really surprised by how good each gun felt and how satisfying was to shoot and kill someone with a headshot. Probably the worst thing about this game for me is the level design, even though it might look interesting at certain points, I realized that most of the time it lacks variety and they just put up a bunch of hills, grass and trees and there you go. Overall I think Call of Juarez is a very good First Person Shooter and I highly encourage any fans of the genre or western stuff to try it out.			"

												Call of Juarez makes a nice first person adventure game. It has some action as well as stealth sequences, which overall leaves quite unique wild west experience. The grahpics are dated, and so are some mechanics of the game, but I believe it's still enjoyable. The story is just ""okay"", but what's really fun about it is we get to experience it from two different perspectives, since we play as two different characters, which is nice. I believe the game is worth a try, but I'm not sure towards what kind of gamers should I recommend it... I believe that if you enjoy first person shooters, and if you can deal with doing some stealth, you'll be fine.			"

The story is good overall, and gonna hook you up till the end. You get to play as two characters , Ray McCall, and Billy Candle, in an alternate episode of both. It also has stealth mechanics , mainly used while playing as billy. The graphics isnt bad at all for its age, sometimes, the scenery tends to be beautiful. Sometimes the gunfights are challenging and the duels, too , sometimes feels easy, sometimes a bit hard. Although, this game is not perfectly Awesome, it impressed me a lot and cant wait to try out its prequel Bound in Blood, which features Ray, when he was a badass, before becoming a preacher.

												If I were to some this game up in a sentence:  Frustrating but rewarding.  That's the feeling that permeates my experience playing.  Some controls and features have a tendency to cause a lot frustrated cursing.  But after those moments are eventually conquered, a rush of excitement is usually the reward.  From riding in mine carts to burning down brothels, this game succeeds more often than not in making the player feel like they playing an action packed western movie.Pros:-Pretty solid visuals that hold up fairly well considering the games age.-Music that won't be making Ennio Morricone jealous any day soon, but certainly fits the mood.-Great voice acting from Marc Alaimo as Father Ray.-Father Ray.  Pretty much the main reason I keep playing.  A psychotic priest that quotes bible passages while shooting hombres.-Quick, exciting gunfights filled with tension as well as adrenaline.-A pretty good learning curve.  It takes a while to get used to, but it doesn't through you into situations that you don't feel entirely unprepared for.-Pretty entertaining story.  But I'm mostly in it just to shoot people.Cons:-Billy Candle.  A bland, whiny little waste of code that exists to drive the plot forward and introduce new game mechanics that usually don't involve shooting bandits in the nuts.-The whip mechanics.  Trying for an Indiana Jones vibe.  Doesn't quite stick the landing.  Literally.  I can not tell you how many times I've died because I didn't swing far enough to make the ledge, or fell to my death because the whip didn't actually grab the branch.  Probably the most frustrating aspect of gameplay.-Kind of glitchy.  This might due to the games age.  I don't mind glitches normally, usually find them pretty funny.  But there have been some occasions where I died because I fell through the ground, or enemies literally materialized into existance right in front of me.  Not game breaking, but a bit annoying.-Tries too many gameplay styles.  I think this is a syptom of the games time.  At the beginning of the 7th generation of consoles, developers crammed all sorts of differing play styles into their games hoping to impress consumers with variety.  This leads to games sometimes feeling more like glorified tech demos than straight Action/Shooter/Platformer/ect. Again, not the end of the world, but hurts the final product.-Father Ray is pretty much only half the game.  The other half is stealthy, whip-swingy douchbag Billy Candle.  Missed opportunity.All in all.  A fun western shoot'em up that loses it's way a bit under the weight of it's own ambition.  Totally reccommended for fans of the genre, so long as they're willing to put up with some of the games idiosynchrasies.7/10			"

												     I'll open by getting this out of the way, I haven't played The Cartel. Reviews were negative and the whole first person,GTA knockoff thing didn't appeal to me. I've only played this, Bound in Blood, and Gunslinger. So, on to this game.     I think this is the best, and worst game in the Call of Juarez series. First, the good stuff. With the exception of the stiff facial animation, the graphics are kinda neat for a 2007 game (obviously aside from Crysis). The foliage actually looks better than most games I've played, and the screen space sun rays make for some cool lighting. The shadows are actually higher resolution than the sequels. But the thing that most impressed me, regarding the visuals, was the dust effect from bullet impacts. In other games, you shoot a tree, the ground, whatever, and the bullet kicks up a small cloud of dust. Call of Juarez goes one step further. If you fire a bullet, an arrow, or even use Billy's whip on one of those dust clouds, it will spread out and away from the projectile. I love the dynamic effect this has on shootouts.     How's the gameplay? Pretty good, when you're in combat. As Ray McCall you can dual wield pistols and occasionally activate a sort of bullet-time for a few seconds. As Billy, the game enters slow-mo every time you aim your bow. Levels tend to be fairly wide open with plenty of space to move around. But there was one thing I could not stand, the duals, which, like the sequels, were a real pain. Overall, the combat is fun, though difficult. However, this game isn't all fighting. It also has stealth and platforming sections, but these were worse than the duals. Enemies seemed to spot me no matter what I did. And there's nothing more infuriating in this game than thinking you've just escaped, and a sharp sound indicates you were caught, triggering an instant fail state. If you manage to get past the stealth sections without rage quitting, then the platforming level might just do you in. Jumping gaps feels awkward, and while using your whip to swing on branches SOUNDS cool, it's almost impossible to accurately determine where you'll land. I lost count of the number of times I fell to my death because of the clumsy first-person platforming.     The story is alright, better than Gunslinger, but worse than Bound in Blood.     I recommend this game IF you can get past the frustrating platforming and stealth levels, and have fun with the combat and visuals. "

												If you're a fan of Spaghetti Westerns or say Stephen King's Gunslinger series, you'll probably like this game. This game is basically a Spaghetti western, from the story line to the bullet-time-like concentration mode. The story is linear and central to this game. For those who insist on an open world, this game is not for you. I noticed quite a few reviewers gave a thumbs down to the game simply because it was a linear game.That said, there are some really annoying things about this game. The physics don't work right at times. For example, you can get stuck trying to simply jump a broken fence or onto a crate. Not being able to pick something up that's inside a drawer you just opened is also annoying. You'll have to try to figure out how to crouch in just the right position in order to target the item.  It's just unnecessary frustration. I also really hate that they made jumping a mandatory skill in the game. You'll find yourself falling because you timed your jump between platforms wrong. This isn't a Mario Bros. game, so why am I doing that anyway?All in all, I really do like this game. The developers captured the essence of the Spaghetti western like no other game.			"

												The gaming industry has been attempting to make a successful Western first person shooter ever since Outlaws, and Call of Juarez succeeds in bringing that to us. The game combines stealth, adventure, combat, gun-play and an open world to explore. This is what a Western should be.While Call of Juarez isn’t particularly perfect in most of these areas, the graphics are visually pleasing for a dated game, the atmosphere is excellent, thanks to the superb cinematic score and the game play is not only varied, but intense and immersive.When you’ve finished with the brief, yet engrossing single-player campaign, you will enjoy the online multiplayer, thanks to some classic modes re-created with some old-west charm.

												One of the best games ever made. It was the first game EVER to have DirectX 10, and it's absolutely beautiful for being a game that's a better part a decade old.My absolute favorite western game, and it's looking like it will be for a long time to come.And for uninitiated, the beginning of this game is semi-buggy. Stick with it, the game stabilizes and will stick with you for a long time.			"

												Pew pew. Reach for the sky. hey partner if you want a nice western game, well you can walk your chaps outta town. Haha im just pulling your reins. This is a good o'l western game classic, the other ones in the series are pretty good as well, as apposed to the Call of Juarez Cartel wich is like a modern time one, where the others are westerns. So lasso up some gold, or rob a bank, and spend your pretty penny on this fine game right here. Doesnt show windows 7 support, but it works fine and dandy on it. And you can right click and run on Dx10.			"

												One of the best and sadly most underappreciated first-person shooters. I loved it back when it came out and it's still as good as I remembered it. The graphics are a bit bad for its time but the gunplay is the best I ever felt in a fps. You play as two characters : Billy Candle, a delinquent accused of murder who must sneak his way through enemies like a stealth game and the crazy old badass Reverend Ray who pursues him while gun-blazing through lots of bandits using akimbo revolvers that allow him to slow down time to shoot groups of enemies Clint Eastwood style.It's a must-play.

												Back in 2006 Techland were still relatively unknown. Having released Chrome before hand, a shooter that got a rather mixed reaction. They followed up with Call of Juarez. Going even further into their own direction they decided to focus on a wild west themed shooter built on their own in house engine. What we got was a gorgeous looking shooter that palyed like a spagetti western with bits of Robert Rodriguez attitude here and there. I bought the original retail release back in 2006 and after finishing it, I hadn't ever really returned to it. But, recently I bought the game again on STEAM and decided to give the entire series (yes even The Cartel) a proper rerun. With the first Call of Juarez I'm still in love with the verys imple and direct style of the game. While at times still wonderfully beautiful in it's visuals, it still comes up short on character animations, which were a bit stiff even back in 2006. And at times, the character models even look a bit rough, as if they are not up to the same level of quality as the levels themselves. The levels... vast, wide open areas. They don't offer much (or any) in the way of exploration. But, they are large enough to give you the feeling of how large the wild west was. The story, is good. Nothing great, but nothing bad. It's solid writing, decent voice acting... but nothing I want to spoil or get into. But, the game is worth playing simply for Reverand Ray alone. His character is and will always be the best part of the first two CoJ titles. The other main character Billy, is... okay. But, at times he's more annoying then engaging and a lot of the time I simply wanted to return to Ray. Gameplay is were the game falters. Switching back and forth between Ray and Billy, offering up variety in gameplay and level design. Something most shooters struggle with. With Ray, it's a more straight forward shooter experience. He's a brawler, strong and a very talented gunfighter. Billy, is weak, but fast and sneaky. And very skilled with a bow and arrow. While the variety is nice, it's also here that problems arise. Ray's levels are wonderful. WIth his armor chestplate able to deflect shots, and his concentration mode being able to down multiple enemies quickly. Issues arise during the ""dualing"", never a great setup... a mouse cursor bug on mordern OS causes the game to be incredibly frustrating during these parts. As for Billy, while the platforming works very well and the stealth is actually done very well also. Billy is very weak, and more often then not they throw you into combat situations as him. Often expecting you to try and just run from them instead of fighting. But, as weak as he is even one lucky shot as you're trying to run (or ride away on a horse) can kill you. A flawed gem, but one I'm enjoying replaying.			"

												The game is a little outdated and therefore has some issues like poor AI and arguably ugly graphics but it's still worth your time.Both the gameplay and the plot are good enough to hold your attention for 8~9 hours, which is how long you'll probably take to finish the story mode.The story alternates between the point of view of two main characters, a badass armored priest and a mexican kid who can use a bow and a whip to stealthily kill people. Each character has unique skills and plays somewhat differently, keeping things interesting.There's also a multiplayer mode, but I never tried it.I doubt there's still people playing it, though.Also, as the priest you can equip a bible on your right hand and a gun on your left hand so you can read bible verses as you shot people.That's the pinnacle of badassery.

												The first Call of Juarez was by far the best western experience in the entire gaming world - both gameplay and story wise - until the release of Red Dead Redemption and it still outshines all other entries of the Call of Juarez series, although Gunslinger did manage to come close.Never before and never again has it been so much fun to rampage around with a completely batshit crazy priest. And the passages where you play Billy are - although frustrating at times - still to this day the best take any game ever had on using whips (I'm looking at you, Indiana Jones).Call of Juarez is definitely part of my everlasting hall of fame and will remain there for many years to come.

												To recommend or not to recommend, an impossible question without knowing who is asking and who much they're thinking of spending. The last six and a half years have be relatively kind to Call of Juarez but it is definitely one for the genre or series fans rather than everyone and the current Steam price of £14 that I'm seeing is definitely too much and I'm glad I didn't pay that much. Mechanicially the game is quite interesting. The plot and the mechanics revolve arround two seperate characters, the young agile sneaky Billy and old psychopathic Reverend Ray. Billy's levels revolve arround stealth and movement, Ray's arround shooting everything that moves before it can shoot you. Neither is perfect, Billy's stealth ability to hide in bushes for instance is particularly dependant on the level designers whim rather than any sense of logic and the Reverend's bullettime ability with pistols is obscenely overpowered, makes no sense at all and breaks up the shooting almost as much as Fallout 3's V.A.T.S. system. So yeah, the run and gun character plays like something out of an RPG... Honestly, it isn't as bad as that sounds though and I had fun playing his levels, and Billy's for that matter, throughout the game. The fact that the mechanics are a bit different from the norm and have their own particular feel is really what has kept this game feeling fresh. It also doesn't outstay its welcome, which admittedly is a flattering way of saying it is short but short and good is a heck of a lot better than long and boring any day. Particularly if you're not paying the sort of money that would demand a game that is both long and good.Plot wise, well it is a western and as such it probably can't be expected to deliver too much and it doesn't really. Two fairly interesting main characters, Ray in particular wouldn't be that interesting just as a background character but as a viewpoint character he is a minor stroke of genus. Sadly the supporting cast are wooden cutouts at best. The female characters are particular badly done by. There are four in total that I noticed: there is Suzy, who works as a prosititute and who basically only exists to have her gun stolen by Billy while she is trying to ""welcome you home"" behind her pimp's back. Then there is Billy's mother who is brutally murdered before she even has a chance to appear in the game and exists pretty much only as an example of the woman in the fridge trope. Then there is the sheriff's wife who is a damsel that must be rescued from some random dudes for reasons. Then there is Molly, the love interest and main female character who is pretty much the most generic boring useless damsel in distress you could hope to meet. If any of these characters had anything approaching an actual character then I must have missed it. As a side note the game should probably come with a trigger warning for sexual violence since it can't seem to shut up about it. I guess they were trying to make it sound gritty but it is completely overdone.Would I recommend it? Well for all my gripes I did have fun and for the couple of quid I paid for it I easily got value for money out of it. I didn't pay £14 for it though and I wouldn't recommend that you do either but as a game that is still fun and interesting, so yeah, I'll recommend it.			"

												This game hasn't aged as well as I'd like, and some of the load times are a bit absurd (for some reason, loading the first level takes so long that the main character is able to fully voice his 3 paragraph introduction before the level is halfway loading - it's easily the longest loading screen I've seen in a game, beating out Civilization 5 and STALKER, even though the scene isn't even that long, and even though the load times are somewhat frequent none of them are nearly as long as that one) and certain parts of the campaign (mainly a few of Billy's parts, which mostly focus on stealth and exploration) just make you want to get back to the shooting, but it's still a great game and the first of a great series (except for The Cartel). If you like the Western setting, I'd very highly recommend it. You can get the full series (this game, Bound in Blood, and Call of Juarez: Gunslinger) for $35 even without a sale, which is completely worth it, but if you want to wait for a sale it'll be a steal. It's also worth noting that even though the DX10 version of the game looks a lot better, it also breaks the steam overlay, so it's a matter of priorities.			"

												I really wanted to like this one because I loved the sequel (Bound in Blood), which I played first. Overall, the production values were great. Voice acting, art style, story, etc. Switching between characters on both sides of the fence also made for interesting gamplay styles and narrative. However, some of the gameplay mechanics are very flawed. Random difficulty spikes and changes in mechanics like fist fighting weren't really fun. There are some stretches of the game where you have to go a long time without heath pickups, and whether you take damage or not is dependent on a random dice roll of whether or not enemies hit your armor or head. The maps are generally linear but whenever new path ways open up, it's not always evident where you are supposed to backtrack to find a new path. This leads to a lot of wandering around, and if you are in a sequence where you have a time limit, finding out where you need to go may lead to failure. There are also stuck in geometry problems if you wander off the the path. It was probably great at the time it was new but it  seems like the game didn't age very well by today's standards. By the end it felt like a boring (but very difficult) slog. I'm still glad I got to get closure on this story, but if you are interested in a western themed shooter, play the sequel Bound in Blood first, and then decide whether you want to play this one to get the full story. The sequel is actually a prequel story-wise, so you don't really lose anything by playing them out of order, in my opinion. Playing this one really made me appreciate the sequel. The devs learned many lessons and improved upon pretty much every gameplay aspect.			"

Techland's only failure in making this game is that their priorty was more about content stuffing, which contributed to a lack of developer-provided intuitiveness in the game.

Oldtimer with some troubles!First of, yes, this game is old, and it sometimes shows. Especially finetuning the game to get it work on modern machines under Windows 7, 8 or 10... You might get the game running, and then you notice, the sound isn't online... next you notice there are graphical glitches. Thank god there are workarounds for this, and if you have some skill in research you will find them quick.The story is good with two protagonists, who are antagonistic. They are old school antiheroes of the italian western style. It's a love/hate thing in this game. Sympathies are misplaced though because both protagonists are more or less... well let's just say they are both not the kind of neighbor anyone wants to have close by. One is a scoundrel and loafer, while the other is a bigot and former gunslinger turned priest. This should be enough about the two protagonists. The story that unfolds during the game is nice though, but you have to kill a lot of people in either forms, they are different in style and in motive. Both are driven by revenge. I played the game when it came out back then, it was fun to play. Now there is of course the feeling of a rerun. Which might scratch a bit on the patina of the game.There is a lot to like about this game, first, the characters are developing during the game. You will see a story and misunderstanding that only unfolds during the run of the game. It is a FPS game, yes, but also it is an adventure.To modern standards this game is a bit dated, it shows in several ways, smudgy textures, not so well in supporting higher resolutions, and then there is the trouble with soundsystems and startup. But with a big ""But!"", this game is fun once you get it started. It reminds a lot on the time when the game was first introduced. Which has been ten years ago. If you like hardcore FPS with some puzzles and twists, some agility parcours and a good backgroundstory, then this game is cut out for you. Besides it's inexpensive and offers a lot for that.RecommendedOn my personal score this game has on a scale between 1 and 15 a rock solid 9 Points. Which would be a C+ or 3+ if put into notes. It's not the perfect experience from back then, but it still has a lot of charm. Even though it's technically far behind, you still can play it and have fun with the game.			"

												Well this game was good. I played it, completed it just now. Graphics coulda been a little better, and it's quite buggy and glitchy, so I was tempted to not recommend it, but it's a good game really with a great story and characters. One thing that ruined it for me and has kind of put me in a downer *POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!*, is at the end, you have to shoot somebody, and it wasn't working for me when I was clicking my left and right mouse buttons or pressing two to reach for the gun in my inventory, and I had to search for like half hour what the heck was up with that and I thought it was a glitch. So I ended up nearly half smashing my keyboard mashing every button to see what worked and it didn't. But I found out you draw your gun by the controls you would use in a gun fight (moving mouse up and down), which was odd as it wasn't, and that really bugged me and put me in a grump by the time of the ending. It was a decent conclusion to the story, though it does end rather sort of obruptly if you will, not too great of a conclusion when there is a lot of things that could have been revealed, and it just pops up with ""THE END"", and when you continue, you're right back at the menu again. Not very heartwarming ending from that. But, I liked it more than not so, here y'are.			"

												Call of D̶u̶t̶y̶  Juarez is a m̶i̶l̶i̶t̶a̶r̶y̶  western themed first-person shooter. The levels are pretty linear and slow-motion is used constantly.Real talk tho, this game is good.	The story covers most of the usual western fare; Horseback chases, a train scene, a lone badass laying waste to the population of an entire town, everything is covered fairly well. The voice acting and writing is nicely done, though the written text can get a bit sloppy, such as the unforgivable ""of"" in the place of ""have"".	An interesting thing to note is that the game doesn't let the player abuse corpses and innocents, sometimes punishing the behavior with a game over. This can get annoying during particularly intense battles. If I accidentally click on a corpse, I'll be prevented from shooting for a second while the character I'm playing as tells me that he won't do it, and sometimes that moment is enough to let something kill me, but that's the thing; From a story perspective, it makes sense. Both of the playable characters have established personalities, and neither of them is a heartless enough ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to disregard their morals, even when it may be convenient.	However, it sometimes gets unrealistic. For example, during the carriage chase, when other horseback riders appear, the only real option is to shoot the riders, and not the horses. I've emptied guns into those animals, but the game doesn't let them die because the developers have made it clear that this is not how the game is meant to be played. The flipside of this is that they can be used as instant barricades to take cover behind, and I did this several times when playing on the hard difficulty.	The best examples, I feel, are the stealth sections as Billy. For most of them, you are not allowed to kill the people you are trying to avoid, essentially making it forced stealth, because they also happen to be innocent, and the entire first half of the game is Billy fleeing from a false murder accusation. However, there's one part, where he has just escaped from town, and the people he has to avoid are criminals. THEN, he has other options.	This game excels at depth of gunplay, and it does so without feeling insulting or overpowering to the player. There is no lock-on, unlike in many other games of the genre. Slow motion is used, sure, but only when it makes sense, such as duels, or to give the player a small advantage in combat. Multitasking is rewarded immensely via the full akimbo shooting. The weapons are all unique, and each has its own practical application; I found myself voluntarily using every type of weapon the game provided to staisfy certain combat situations. However, because the guns degrade and eventually break from continuous use, the player will sometimes have to make use of unpreferable alternatives just to survive. It's all enough to keep the shootouts tense, and that's what really matters. That's when the game is at its best, when the player is ducking in and out of cover with extremely responsive controls to fend off hordes of enemies.	My biggest problem with the game is that it just feels lacking. It's difficult to put into words, because pretty much everything it does, it does well, but it never feels like it goes quite as far as it could. The levels often contain wide stretches of traversable land, but the objectives are fairly linear, so while it is possible to explore much of what there is to see, there is usually no reason to do so apart from (maybe) collecting some pickups. I had to play through it several times before I felt satisfied.	The multiplayer is also pretty dead nowadays. There aren't many populated servers, and most of the ones I found had pretty high ping. If you're getting this game, you're going to be sticking mainly to the single player, so thank heavens it's breddy gud.			"

Играя за двух персонажей, вам придется подстраиваться под их стиль. Один предпочитает скрытность, а второй - сущий дьявол, и убивает всех направо и налево.

												A peculiar cycle of games, the Call of Juarez series was one of the more thoughtful FPS shooters to be produced in many years.   The first game was a prequal to the second, using  a very post modernist way to tell its backstory. Well designed, Call of Juarez has an intuitive game system and graphics engine, no doubt. Despite the valleylike walls of the settings, which make the levels feel like open mazes, the environments are  pleasing tothe eye. The shooting dynamics are well implemented. Billy's whip and Ray's excellent handling of guns are interesting new features. However, the stealth chapters of the story tend deprive players of having more of a chance to have firefights, which is remedied later on in the game, but only in the final chapter. Also, interactions with NPC's of the chapters is reduced to a minimum, leading to the impression that there isn't much human involvement beyond the strictly necessary.Call of Juarez is a useful case study and a compelling adventure, though it was a new breed of animal in its infancy. The game has to be appreciated for all that it's got, not the elements that sometimes don't feel satisfying or complete enough.			"

												This is a Jekyll and Hyde game. The parts with Billy are just tedious and boring. They could have been left out completely, save for the plot. The other parts with the priest are the most fun. At its core this is basically a shooting gallery on rails.  But it's fun, and it does the western them well. Plus, the bullet time mechanic keeps it fresh most of the time. It does suffer from some bugs and or bad design on higher difficulties. So I'd recommend just the normal difficulty. Also, the textures are pretty outdated. However, from my understanding gfx mods are available to give it a more polished look. It's hard to say I'd necessarily ""recommend"" this game. I had a good time for the price. And since this game is regularly on sale, I'd say pick it up if you're looking for a western-themed game. And if you cheat through the Billy missions...don't fret. We won't judge...			"

												A fun western shooter, the first in it's franchise. While I found the controls somewhat clunky and the game immensly difficult (even on easy) I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The beginning is a pain in the ♥♥♥, as you have to dodge bullets and learn to use the whip to swing from ledges like Indiana Jones. Once you get past that part though, it gets a fairly bit easier. Also, I recommend keeping an online walkthrough handy as at some points I had no idea where to go or what to do. (In the end I only used the walkthrough once, and that was during the final mission.) In Conclusion it's a fun and interesting start to a great game series.Tl;DR: Game is fun, but at times difficult and confusing; controls can be clunky.			"

												it is one of the gems from the past. the story is a blast and the general game mechanics are pretty neat to think of when the game was made. the game takes place back in the wild west of texas in 1884 as a youngster call'd Billy Candle. the story is pretty straight forward and easy to grasp. Billy was the ""trouble maker"" and everyone in the town hated his guts. the only one who liked you in the home town was your ma, and a girl at the brothel named Suzy. after everyone giving Billy the hardest of time, he ran away to look for the Gold of Juarez. some time later he returns empty handed, and the town is still on his neck.im gonna skip the rest for now to get onto the gameplay, you get 2 pistol sloths, this is pretty cool as you can dual wield identical guns or diffrent guns. some might be rusty and break after a few barrels, some might be ready to break. you get a sloth for ranged and shotgun on the share. its a small variety, but enough to get you trough thte game without losing intrest. there are more sloths, but they are specific for each char.with that said, you play between 2 characters: Billy and Ray. Ray being the brother of you stepdad, being a priest. while Billy is the acrobat, Ray is heavy and have a chance of dodging bullets thanks to his chainmail armor. but this takes away his ability to climb. Ray can use dynamite whenever he finds it and got a bible he will always carry around. Billy on the other hand.. personally i never found dynamite as billy.. but he gets to use a bow which is the most usefull weapon you get. there are plenty of ammo, and i always had above 50 bullets, but when aiming with the bow, you enter slowmo, making it easy to hit moving targets, but you gotta aim infront of the run motion, or else you'll just hit the air behind him.another good thing about controlling billy is the stealth mechanics, it doesnt work too good on its own, but during stealth chapters, its pretty fun. you get prectiaclly invisible in bushes and the AI dont know you'r whereabouts unless they've seen you hide.here is the downside, tought.. sometimes during cutscene, if you see the screen sorta shake, get ready to load back, cause you'll either fall trough the map, or levitate up, just to fall to your death. its a problem i had a few times, mostly as Ray, but just stand on solid ground before entering the cutscene and try from diffrent angles and you'll bne fine. another bad thing that is more major to the game is the Whip mechanic. as billy, you get the whip that will help you around, over clifs, scaling mountains and some other places.. but its so inacurate that it was a pain to use instead of fun. the whip is so short that its barely usefull, and you gotta stand on the edge of the cliff to use it, risking falling down. and you can even use it on the thinest of branch.. it is usefull as a melee tough, as you might not wanna waste bullets on the wildlife or close up enemies.aiming from a distance with the guns need some work, and you're practically a sitting duck if you try. unless you got a rifle. you collect health from bottle of alcohol(?) and depending on the difficulity you choose, it gives a fair amount of health.. i usually play on the hardest difficulity to get the challange and put the game to the challange, but i barely could stand the 2nd chapter, because the aiming and the cutscene went against me. it got too frustrating, so i finishd the game on easy. its hard enought to fight against the game mechanics of the first stages. but it either smoothes out the futher you play, or you simply get used to itthere is a dual system that is alil funny and alil wierd. when you are challanged, you push your mouse up to draw your gun. you dodge bullets in slowmo while aiming for the kill.. nothing to say about it. its fun and difficult, but not because of the game mechanics, its because you gotta do serval things at the same time. aim for a lethal shot on the enemy, watch out for bullets, dodge bullets. even if it is slowmo, bullets travels fast, so you gotta keep up.i give alot of these verdicts, and i cant really tell why, but i enjoyd the game enough to give it a 7/10. its clunky and got some stupid things, yeah, sure. but that didnt really take away from the whole experience. Call of Juarez is a game serie i could get addicted to if it wasnt for the lack of games and replayability. atleast this is a game you might just wanna play trough once or twice. the others however... i will cover that on those games ;P			"

												Before Dead Island brought Techland to the spotlight, they'd actually already released the fantastic Call of Juarez.Let's start with the negatives; the loading times are atrocious. I mean, you could probably fire up the game, go to the bathroom and take a dump and be back in time just to see the last centimeter of the loading bar filling up. The other negative is a technical issue, there's no option for vsync and it has to be forced on via d3doverdriver. I wasn't able to force it via AMD's CCC. Another negative would be the horse controls, not the best, but a good effort for a game from 2006.Now the positives; the story is a classic western tale. A young man comes home after months of searching for treasure and isn't exactly given a warm welcome. It only gets worse when he arrives at his farm to find his mother and step father dead. Billy is one of two protagonists, the other being Reverand Ray, the brother of Billy's step father. Switching between the two characters throughout the various episodes during the duration of the game sets up brilliant pacing with the story. As Ray hunts down Billy, believing he murdered his brother and in-law, you'll come across bandits and apache, various landscape of the massive western USA. From mountains and valleys, to the heat stricken Mexico. It's quite the adventure. What I really liked about the gameplay was the change in tone, Billy, being a slimmer character and less hardened, used stealth to sneak through levels, while Ray is the run and gun type while taking cover and strategizing. That's about it.9/10			"

												One of the best games i ever played. first started playing this back when it came out but the old dell's and HP's couldn't handle it properly. I always expected it to be a western shooter but it's much more than that! You got platforming, stealth, quick-handled gunfights and a fast-paced storyline right here at the end of your big iron. Or bow, if that's what you prefer.The setting, Texas, San Jacinto, Coldspring. Beautiful platform mountains and pricklu cacti. The story, you're learning about the main characters and see them change and grow. It captivated me the whole time.10/10 would bury the poor man's father all over again			"

Story is fantastic but the presentation isn't the best due to graphical limitations. Still, it's difficult to decide which Call of Juarez is best but this one lets you equip the Bible and press a mouse button to quote passages from it while shooting desperados with the gun in your other hand.

												Call of Juarez is a very weird game to explain. One minute you will be having the time of your life and the next you'll be wishing it was just over.. Call of Juarez shines when you are in a shoot out with bandits. When you shoot a guy in the face and he does three backflips before he lands it's pretty funny. Also Billy gets to use a bow which goes into Slow Mo when right clicked. I never had as much fun with a video game then I did with that bow.Sadly Call of Juarez lacks focus. It has a poor story, poor platforming, and poor direction. Most of the level are completely linear but at the end they throw in these big open world like areas with nothing at all in them. They also have a level that is based around platforming which like I said isn't all that great. CoJ also wants you to remember everything it teaches you because at some point in the game it will use that feature. I found myself stuck many times because a feature that quickly explained then never used again is randomly used again under a time limit(short ones at that).None the less I say pick of CoJ for yourself and give it a go. It's fun for bit but some things will just make you say what the ♥♥♥♥ were they thinking?			"

												Before Dying Light, before Dead Island, a little company known as Techland developed Call of Juarez.  Not a bad title but in hindsight I can see they had a huge scope of what they wanted to do, but they werent quite sure how to convey it.The story was decent, but where it shined was the way it was told.  Told from two perspectives, flitting back and forth in a dance of death, deception, and flying sombreros.  At the same token, I didn't find myself becoming immersed in the world or really caring one way or another for anyone in it.-A linear fps.  Tries to have open-world levels that don't add to the experience.-Stealth mechanics that don't really matter.-Fun gun-fights with weapons that can jam up or break!-Showdowns that tested my frustration limits.-Bullwhip physics!Not a great game, though you may have more interest in it if you are a fan of westerns.  6.5 out of 10.

												Call of Juarez is a throwback to the old westers, but is it a wester you want to visit ? In Call of Juarez you play as Two charecters Billy is on the run when framed for murder and Ray (the other charecter you play) Is hunting down Billy. So hows the game ? Well its pretty standart fps stuff. The guns in the game work like any other guns but as a cowboy you can duel wield two guns of youre own choice. The hit detection isnt the best in the game since many times you miss youre target completly and the stealth is broken beyond repair since enemies see you five miles away and have shoot you and dont miss a single shot. This game has a pretty good story and the graphics do look good when maxed out, but some of the charecter desings do look ugly. Overall the game is a really fun cowboy game, great story, interesting charecters, great gun battles and all things that make a wester game are in it and the game is pretty long and plus a fun Mp to take away some of youre time check it out for the full price its worth it i give Call Of Juarez an 8/10			"

												The shooting mechanics are pretty aged, but the same can be said for just about every FPS from 2007.The game really stands out in its story, and by extension, the level design. Instead of just going around shooting people in the Wild West, you visit a great variety of locations and often have goals beyond just shooting things. Climbing a giant plateau in the middle of a lake to steal an eagle feather from its nest was more entertaining and tense than pretty much anything an FPS has thrown at me in the past 5 years.			"

												From the moment you start playing the game you can tell the studio was very ambitious and put a lot of heart into this western fps title, however, either due to their inexperience, budget constraints or some drunk binges between level and gameplay designers, they also created mechanics and levels that led to a lot of frustration.Throughout the campaign you play as either Billy or the Priest. They both play quite differently based on the mechanics and weapons they get in the levels. The Priest is where the meat of the game is. Fun, fast, frantic shoot em up action with slo mo, dual pistols, shotguns and rifles and the occasional stand off western style(which is pretty meh because its timed and thus you know exactly when the opponent is about to shoot). As a counterpoint to that, to let the player take a breather, Billy gets the levels where he has to stealth and platform. This would be fine, except both elements are pretty flawed. Stealth is mostly fine and will provide little to no challenge as you can sneak by anyone as long as they're not looking directly at you, however platforming is really really bad. First of all, you get a whip which you can use to attach to trees. The hit detection is very poor and you'll often only be able to use it only specific branches or trunk of a tree, which sometimes turns it into a tedious guessing game. The whip is also a missed opportunity as you could have used it in clever ways in combat to reposition enemies and grab items, but ultimately its for swinging from trees. Then the very worst part of platforming is that an animation plays out every time you reach for a ledge and Billy makes a noise. Now, in the early levels thats fine, if a bit annoying. BUT. Some level designer decides to a create a whole mission around you climbing a mountain. Now imagine that you have to wait for an animation and sound to play out as you're climbing 30-40 ledges, sometimes up to 6 in a row.The only redeemable quality about Billy is that he gets to use the bow, which is one of the best and most fun to use weapons in the game as you slow down time when you aim with it and its fun to take out enemies from a long range. Now, i mentioned that you had to a climb a mountain. That mission is part of series of bizzare quests involving a shaman thats easily the worst part of the game. You have to hunt 3 rabbits, which would be fine if they weren't REALLY REALLY SMALL, and some of the areas you're supposed to find them have grass twice as big as the rabbit. Even after the string of horrible shaman related quests, most of Billys quests after that resolve around platforming and solving puzzles all of a sudden, it takes a bizzare turn, as if the developers didn't know what to do with the character and the approach they were taking.Besides the mentioned shaman quests which have pretty poor level design, you will also be revisiting the same levels with both characters for the majority of the game(due to budget constraints im guessing), which also makes me think that the shaman quests were implemented just to extend the playing time.Talking more on the side the pros than cons, as I mentioned, it's really fun to play as the Priest Ray and the horse riding and horse combat in this fps is surprisingly really really good, which makes for exciting chase scenes. The game also creates an immersive atmoshphere and has a passable story. Billy isn't really likeable as a character, but Ray is definitely the highlight in the story, a flawed man on his own path to redemption, his voice acting really stands out as one of the best I've heard in a game ever, and stands tall above the passable voice acting of the other characters. It's grizzly and haunting.Overall, it's hard to recommend the game to everyone. I can see that playing as Billy could really turn some people off this game and the levels in which you play as him become more flawed as you go along, but the Ray segments are all fun shoot em up segments, and evne Billys levels have some exciting moments. It's definitely flawed, but if you can get past that it's a short, fun campaign. "

												This game gave me times of raging because you would die in the dumbest ways so easy but it made up for all the ridiculousness with fun gameplay and wonderful visuals. The gun fights in this game are awesome with the physics of the AI as you shoot them they die the way you shoot them instead of just falling to the ground which is a very nice touch to the game. The slow-mo action is really awesome and gives you the edge you need to defeat your enemies. The things to know when playing this game is first and far most save alot, if you don't it will bring you back quite a bit because the auto-save feature sometimes has a big gap in between each auto-save. I loved the shootouts, the scenery of the valley's,canyons, and towns were you fight. The horseback riding was fun but a little stiff. The overall game and story were very well done . Multiplayer is still active but small. The whole game was a great story and adventure!			"

												This is an excellent but short FPS along the lines of Half Life, but in a faithful western setting.While old, it has aged well and runs completely bug free in 4K under Windows 10.   Numerous graphics settings round out the PC-first ethic of the developers.Gameplay is novel, with two protagonists (each level has you controlling one of the two), each with different strengths and weaknesses.  While this could have just been a gimmick it was implemented in such a way that you can enjoy the strengths of each character without being frustrated by their limits.Great level design gives you multiple paths to achieve the same outcome, and excellent re-use of assets stretches the game out from the (admittedly short) 15 hours it took me to finish.A few small gripes - the ""quickdraw"" duel mechanic is janky and annoying.   Some of the puzzles are obtuse.  The game is dated (but has aged well).    These aren't showstoppers, however.			"

												Call of Juarez is the first of a rather unremarkable series of western shooters. The series is about half and half in my opinion. Bound in Blood and Gunslinger are both great entries in the series. This one is the original and all I have to say is that it's outdated and unremarkable. It runs like crap on high end PCs in DirectX 10 mode and it feels janky at 60 FPS. The bullet time is awkward (you have to holster your guns first and then whip them right back out while trying to shoot with two auto piloted crosshairs) and the stealth is just god awful. The premise is cool, where you play two characters playing a game of Cat and Mouse with each other but that's all I have to say that's positive. Many might say this harkens back to the older, more open first person shooters. While this may be true, it still doesn't change the fact the game gives you very broad objectives with very little hints as to what you actually need to do to complete these objectives and not die four times doing a simple task such as ""Jump out the window of a house"". My bullets didn't feel like they made any impact and the game is strewn with bad level design. Refund please.			"

Do I simply ""Play Call of Jaurez"", OR ""Play Call of Jaurez - DirectX 10... Play Call of Jaurez in safe mode... Play Call of Jaurez in safe mode - DirectX10... Play Call of Jaurez dedicated internet server... Play Call of Jaurez DirectX 10 benchmark""

WHAT KIND OF F*CKING OPTIONS ARE THESE!?!?!?! THEY MUST BE HERE FOR A REASON, IS GOD GIVING ME A SIGN THAT THIS IS A SH*TLOAD OF F*CK!?
Oh Techland, you're games are so sh*tty, I think I should play in safe mode. But I'm going to try vanilla, I'M GOING IN MISSIONARY. ...Just watch me get F*CKED IN THE A**HOLE!

Anyways, the graphics are decent for its time. Although the wind blowing with the environment looks like f*cking white squares which irrtates my eyes god damnit!

I had to go down a hill at the start, and hold S to slow myself. So I go down, hold S and nothings happening, and die! Great!
I try again, kind of worked, hurt myself though and now my health's at 10/100.
Next you break into an old grumpy mans farm, steal his handgun and force him to let you in his land to shoot empty bottles for target practice.
I tried to shoot him first, BUT OH NO! ""If you shoot innocent people we will end the game."" ... okay? None of your f*cking business what I do in your game I PURCHASED IT YOU HAVE MY DOUGH $$$$.
Then I met up with a rabid wolf, so I shot it. After it died I tried to shoot it again, BUT YOU CAN'T EVEN SHOOT DEAD THINGS!!!! It doesn't let you! What the f*ck!?

The loading screens are like Half Life, you walk to the next section and have to wait for the new one to load, but it takes FOUR TIMES LONGER! JESUS CHRIST! Even loading the game from the menu it's SO LONG!
When I saw the Sheriff, even though the big red X was over him, I did the classic; aim away, then shoot while moving towards your target AND KILLED HIM!!!! And yes, the game does restart, but f*ck you!!

So after getting an almost bl*wjob in the act, you have to run away. Which is impossible cause the town is shooting your a*s (come on do I really need to block out ♥♥♥ at this age where even family tv shows say it??) while you can't defend yourself and have to run into brush. BUT I CAN'T MAKE IT OUT! My health has been at 10 SINCE THE START AND NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I TRY I DIE.

You know it's really not that bad of a game, I'm just not restarting. Even though I didn't get very far. I'd stick with Bound in Blood!

												on the topic of lunchables pizza i just had one of these the other day it was perfection in a can, i tell you what.

Last, but not least, the cheese, mozarella cheese to be exact. If you're tied of big business pushing overly flavorful cheese products in your face then this is was made for you. . Ok so the nitty gritty when you combine all the ingreds with bread>sauce>cheese>pepperoni its like a taste of nothing you've ever wanted to experience before. The bread, which is in no way cardboard, even though it keeps cardboards classic texture, holds up the ingreds perfectly and you def do not drop any cheese with every bite all over your shirt. all in all i would give this product a 8713/10 i was blown away with its affordability and versatility to take the place of actual food.

Unfortunately can't give it a thumbs up as I did not enjoy playing CoJ.			"

												Solid gameplay but gets in the way too much. Forced stealth sections. The game constantly patronizes you, can't even shoot at a corpse.The game is just constantly getting in the way of itself. I suppose they wanted to add all these sections in for the sake of immersion or an epic story, but it fails due to terrible execution.Shame because the levels look beautiful, guns feel nice, good music too. Too bad though.			"

												Once upon a time, when this game was new, a younger me clocked many a hour into the console version of the game.  The graphics blew my mind, the gameplay was challanging, and it was all around good.  I am sad to say it has not aged well.  The graphics, while still decent, take such a toll on processing its anazing how hard my PC had to work.  Gameplay feels very clunky, and once you master the abilities that slow time, you have won the game.  The ""Indiana Jones"" part is still part entertaining and hair pulling frustrating, as it was back then, but sometimes you fail to level design mistakes as opposed to your own actions.  If you get it, SAVE OFTEN, it will pay off.If you don't have it, go for something else.  The multiplayer is Ok, but if thats all you want, there are free games with basically the same set up.			"

												Spend 90 seconds moving your cursor around a tree trying to find a spot where the game will allow you to attach your whip.Finally attach your whip and try to swing across the gap.The place on the tree you grabbed doesn't let you swing far enough across. Fall and die.Reload save.Repeat 30 times.Give up.This has been my experience with Call of Juarez. The gameplay mechanics are bad even by 2006 standards. The protagonist rolls into town and everyone hates him enough to start trying to him. I can't blame them. In the first half hour I wanted to kill the protagonist too. Combine that with bad first person stealth sections, unbearable first person platforming, and load screens that are just as long or longer than they were a decade ago, and you've got a pretty miserable gaming experience. There might be a decent story later on, but I can't imagine it being good enough to slog through this gameplay.UPDATE: So after eventually jumping the gap while waiting for all the trading cards to drop I completed a few episodes. In those episodes I encountered annoying timed pursuit scenes, lackluster gunplay against bullet sponges, and gunfight encounters with unskippable intro cutscenes. I'm doubling down on the ""not recommended.""			"

												Plays like one long cutscene with only one path and one way of playing (and has some unskippable actual ones I had to endure multiple times after a savepoint). The only real gameplay I've seen so far is whip swinging, which I gather from other reviews, features heavily, and is pretty awful. Admittedly I haven't got very far, but I quit out when going slightly the wrong way brought me into contact with an invisible wall which instakilled me, putting me back before another cutscene. 'the sherrif always blames me' - decides he needs a gun so he illegaly visits a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with intent of stealing hers gets shot at, then later steals bullets from an old guy in the forest, who enacts the exact same scene.

												The first real 'mission' requires you to sneak out of town; Good luck with that! According to the few available guides you're supposed to go through an alleyway, which simply doesn't exist for me for whatever reason, and going through the broken fence in the direction of the objective results in being shot to death, that's if the fall down the hill doesn't kill you first.How is this a good starting point for any game, at all?Then there's the problem of the auto-save feature not actually showing any saves in the load menu, the 10 minute battle with the video settings file to try and remove those dumb black borders (editing the file only resulted in the game resetting all the video settings) and the very irritating mini-cutscenes interrupting movement every 2 minutes... not to mention the ♥♥♥♥-poor voice acting, this was a really disappointing waste of time and money.Maybe 2007 me would have angrily persisted through before getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at some other ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game-breaking mechanic, but not sane, current-day me.

												Horrible game. Old. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Runs poorly on Windows 10. No manual save. Ridiculously bad controls for an FPS. First I fell down a cliff in the tutorial and lost 90% of my health, great. Then the tutorial told me to go to a place, but didn't tell me sneaking through tall grass wouldn't get me spotted (which was a problem, since the guy always spotted me). After finally getting a gun and shooting 3 cans, my gun gets taken away, because ♥♥♥♥ you Sherriff. I then don't even get a blow job from the cute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, because I have no money, so I have to sneak in through a window with a whip. Great. Bad mechanics already. Of course I get found out, the gun I was supposed to steal has no bullets, so I have to flee. Through said window. I died, because I took fall damage. Ok, next attempt. Unskippable cutscene. Great. Didn't die outright. Ran outside, cutscene didn't trigger. Wandered around aimlessly for a few moments. Still hearing the guy shout obscenities at me. Checked back in the room. No guy. Died by jumping out the window. Rinse repeat. Cutscene triggers this time. I am told to SNEAK OUT OF TOWN.Of course no matter if I run or sneak the cowboys find me and start shooting at me as I make my escape. Since I only have SEVEN HP left, 1 shot kills me. Since it is unavoidable apparently to not get hit, I am now stuck. Thanks. That would mean restarting the whole ♥♥♥♥ing game. Ok, I look for a cheat to replenish my health, since it's wasn't possible before that (seriously, if you make a tutorial in which the player can take irreversible damage and thus can't continue? F yourselves). So I make it out of the town, thanks to Health. I have to once again jump down cliffs. I come to another set of cliffs. I try to go down. I die. Apparently I went out of the level -.-Next try. Of course the save point is BACK IN TOWN and I have to ♥♥♥♥ing use the cheat again. This time I don't fall to my doom but continue forwards on an inconspicuous path. Until I get to a tree branch on which I need to swing with my whip...yeah. The first time it actually worked. When I got to the second branch where I actually had to swing like a monkey, my character didn't make the jump. BACK TO TOWN!!!!!! That's when I rage quit the game. Seriously. ♥♥♥♥ this game.

The game is easy with the slow time for pistols (Ray) and bow (Billy), but the quicktime draw events seem unbalanced.  I also dreaded the bad stealth and jumping/lasso sections.I guess if you really need a western fix, this would be an option. Otherwise I'd stick with the newer CoJ releases.			"

It's a pretty decent game- it's pretty to look at, the story is interesting, gameplay is decent, controls are easy and it is challenging..... but I'm just not a big fan of western shooters. I did give it a good go with the hope that it would get better, but I just found it a little too repetitive. Make your way here, avoid baddies there, shoot baddies everywhere. In some parts, I found it so challenging that I wanted to throw my computer out the window and I found myself stuck in some places and had to read through a walkthrough.

I did not get very far in the game, due to having major problems with the whip, using it to get over gaps. The controls for the whip are very difficult, with trying to swing across, and failing multiple times over, which can be very frustrating. Maybe other people will like it and become more acceptable for the controls, but for me, I was not satisfied with it. Sorry :(			"

												There's an equation in the gaming industry that every developer seems to believe: popular genre A + popular genre b = awesome!  In practice, sometimes this is true (first person tower defense games are ok), but in the case of Call of Juarez, it simply leads to jumbled, subpar gameplay.  It's not even fair to say that Call of Juarez is a hybrid, it's basically two different games in the same shell tied together with a crappy story.  You could get much the same experience by playing a level of Thief, and then playing a level of Call of Duty.  Well, sort of, both of those games are much better designed than their respective segments in Call of Juarez.  Starting with the sneaky bits, in Call of Juarez there doesn't appear to be all that much actual sneaking.  Apparently to the developers, jumping out of windows is the same as sneaking, because you do that an awful lot.  Even if you do manage to sneak past your enemies, the game will just have them find you anyway at the next set piece.  Also, a hallmark of sneaking games is the relatively open level design and expectation that you'll find your own way around.  Call of Juarez thinks you're too stupid to handle open levels, so the everything is just linear with a couple of crate puzzles thrown in.The shooting bits are hardly any better.  Every shooter has to have its AWESOME SHOOTER MECHANIC THAT NO ONE HAS EVER DONE BEFORE to differentiate itself, and in the case of Call of Juarez, it's a quickdraw mechanic.  In practice, this is sort of the wild west version of bullet time from Max Payne except for the fact that your character can't hit the broad side of a barn.  In most fpses I can crack off head shot after head shot, but the controls are so soft in this game that I'm lucky if I manage to shoot in the general direction of my foes.There's not to say there aren't some cool things about this game.  For one, you play as a preacher for the shooty bits, and there's nothing cooler than a preacher with guns.			"

												hard to believe it's 2006 game, feels like playing video games at late 90s. Yes history is not bad. however very bad gameplay, terrible graphics and animayions makes realy hard to play (in bad way). If you can buy with bundle (definately not worth to buy as standalone, definately not worth that price) maybe you can spent some time for it. Otherwise no way, ignore metascore, it's seriously overrated.			"

												Call of Juarez is a great western game plaged by some minor issues that while they can be annoying still make the game worth while. First of all the setting music characters and weapons are all well realised despite the fact that there is no new spin on the formula. The voiceacting is pritty good especialy Ray who's preacher background and line delivery make him a true badass. The story follows Ray and Billy. Who must find out both wish to find the killer of billys parents. On this journy there is a lot of gunplay stealth and puzzel solving between the two characters who you both controle during their own levels. The only downside to this is the re using of locations but the narritive justifies this in a decent manor. the platforming can have some annying physics puzzels and hit detection but since most western games dont feature it it's a nice additon.  the gunplay is good it has a dueling mechanic that works well, there is a mode that slows time down and lets you get off a couple of shots when you draw. Also Ray can use his bible to scare the enamies I didn't use it much but i thought it was a fun mechanic. The graphics are good for a 2005 game. there is a bunch of texture popin though. It didn't break the western admosphere for me. While no Red Dead Redempton this game is defniatly worth your time.			"

												Only 9 hours on Medium difficulty, but it was just right.  Call of Juarez was a very pleasant surprise.  I had gotten good press on it from a friend who had just played it, and so I picked it up on sale from Steam.  The story is awesome, and it's just difficult enough so you can't just play straight through it without having to try a few times in certain places.  The graphics, while dated don't look bad when you play in DirectX 10 mode.  The physics of the weapons, while sometimes a little unreal, overall I enjoyed getting used to.  I have to say that my favorite weapon in the game was the Bow and Arrow.  It was a very fun play, and over way before I knew it.  The ending was a little bit on the shallow side, but the content throughout the whole game made up for it.  Buy It!			"

												I grabbed this western for 2.50 a few years ago and finally decided to play it. And..it's alright. The story is okay. The graphics (for it's time) were okay. The gameplay was okay. The soundtrack was okay. The game is average. Guns randomly explode and quit working after extended use (which is stupid). You have to defeat the final boss three times (which is also stupid). The platforming is absolutely awful. But it is definitely worth 2.50. The best part of the game is Reverand Ray. His dialogue is entertaining and his parts throughout the game are bloody and lack platforming. I'd recommend it for anyone when it is on sale and are willing to shell out a few bucks for a few hours of distractions (and frustration). 7.5/10 "

												This game already had a pretty good reputation, so I'm not going to say it was better than I expected, but it certainly was more than I expected. I went in anticipating a simple FPS in a western setting, but the truth is that it's much deeper than that. It has adventure, puzzle, and platforming elements, which are incorporated into the game with varying degrees of success. Being in control of two very different characters adds even more to the already varied nature of this game. The story is pretty decent and keeps you entertained, although at times it's undermined by the uneven voice acting. All in all, this is a pretty good title and you can see that Techland have poured their hearts into it. Recommended.			"

												The only reason I would play a 10 year old FPS is because I like Western games that much. I was looking to sate my western hunger again, and found the Call of Juarez series. It's definitely dated, but it's a good western. The fun mechanics include dual wielding guns, and ""Concentration Mode"" where you draew both guns, you get a slowed down ""bullet time"" effect to shoot multiple bad guys very quickly. The game crashed on me several times. I played it in ""Safe Mode"" for the majority of the game to ensure it wouldn't crash. It still did. But it's mostly playable. The story is good, and the voice acting is great, but the last third of the game feels like you're just doing tedious stuff to drag out the time. I played it in 11 hours. If this wasn't a western, I would have given up on it. But if you're hankering for old tiney gunslinging, I'd say it's worth it. Don't pay $20 for it though. Find it on sale.			"

												This game is pretty fun overall but it has a massive flaw: Billy Candle. In my opinion this character is the only thing really holdign this game back from being as good as Bound in Blood. Ray's levels are fun, and the shooting is satisfying, but Billy's levels ae a mixture of broken stealth and the same shooting but with a character who sucks at everything. Billy can't use guns nearly as well as Ray and can take about two hits before dying. Instead, he has to rely on a bow that slows time, but is finicky to use. Not only that but Ray's end of the story is far better, I cared about what happened to him because he is a good character. Billy's story made me irritated, primarily because he is a huge whiner who is a complete scumbag for most of the game. In the very beginning he talks abot how the sherrif of his hometown is always giving him crap, and then the first thing he does when he gets to town is steal from three different people, two of which were being kind to him. Basically, this game is good as long as you are playing as Ray, Billy can go die in a fire.			"

												Call of Juarez... anxty western with bad hair, nice horse animation and an enjoyable (if forgettable) overall experience. I picked this up in a bundle offer a while ago (I think it came with my copy of Metro 2033) and it sat patiently in my games tab for over six months before i finally decided to give it a try. After having shot through the storyline in a shade over 8 hours, I wound up at the finish line with a slight feeling of disappointment I mean, it's a nice game overall with some lovely wildlife animations, a clean minimalist HUD, an interesting (if cliche'd) story and a good pace changer with the story and gameplay switching between the two dfferent characters. But despite the overall pleasent experience, there are some crumbs in the bed causing a serious itch.First, the observant will notice that some loading screens have gross typos and grammatical errors that should have been caught in pre-release by QA.Second, the PC controls and gameplay reek of a quick and dirty port from console to PC platform, this can lead to some annoying moments of button mashing at times. Additionally, the mouse input during duels feels like my crosshair is mired in treacle.Third, the gameplay is short... as in you can get through it without trying in under 10 hours with ease and more likely you'll finish it in 6 to 8 hours and little replay factor other than backtracking to pick up Wanted posters that you missed on your first run.So overall, if it's on offer and you have a day to waste then pick it up, just don't count on it for replay value.And in closing, what happened to Suzy after the Reverend finished with the saloon???

												A great game, even if i replayed it now after a lots of years since i played it first time in highschool time. It was a nice experience to replay it and still it has a good graphic. It is a western, who is played as a story in two characters, one as Billy a young man who is returning in his own town and get in a lot of trouble, and the other character is the priest who is runinng after Billy the most part of the game and in the final he figure it out that Billy was set it up for some murders and it wasn't his fault so they join together in the last mission. Overall a short story but a nice one, good graphics for his time and a nice trip in the old wastern. Enjoy it. i put some pictures on my profile so u can see the graphics.			"

												I loved playing ""gunslinger"", so added the rest of the series to my wishlist and waited for a sale.  The ""black Friday"" sale resulted in all of the Juarez games being 50% off, so I took the plunge.  Unfortunately, it is really hard to go back to the beginning on some of these franchises, as the early ones seem so primitive by comparison.  Maybe this game was great years ago when it came out, but I m finding it a little-- well, primitive.  With the graphics this is to be expected.  Howver, the user controls have apparently also evolved quite a bit since the original game.  I didn't expect this much difference, as many games have pretty similar controls from the beginning-- like the COD series.  The user controls in the original  COJ are pretty different from Gunslinger, especially the focus and dueling.  I'm still trying to figure it all out.  I realize the later games built on these early techniques, but again-- very differentn, and hard to go back.Still, if you get it on sale, and don't mind a nostalgic game experience, you may enjoy the original Call of Juarez.  If you already played Gunslinger, Just don't expect too much.			"

												I used to play a game called Outlaws in the mid nineties, which was such a good  western game at the time, but windows 95. Since then I have tried several good western games such as gun, which is also good, but not with the game play of Outlaws - now there is. Call of Juarez is like a modernised version of Outlaws and it is very enjoyable. Have seen some complaints about the fast draws, but I am a PC person and use a mouse and keyboard, so no problems and great fun. I am so happy to have found this gem and have played it all the way through. I have an i3 processor and GTX 750 graphics card  and could run everything at max settings, which meant fairly good graphics. Have fun, which is what gaming is all about for me.			"

												All in all, Call of Juarez is a great game that blends elements of old and new FPS together in an intriguing way. Combined with an awesome story and voice-acting worthy of any good western film or novel, the game is more than worth the cost. It takes a little getting used to but if you keep at it, you won't be disappointed.       The game regularly shifts between two characters, which is very cool from a story perspective, as you see how two people sharing the same story can have very different perspectives. However, the two characters are mechanically different, which can be a pain as one gets used to the play style of one, only to be thrown back into the other guy and having to adjust abruptly.       Billy plays fast and light, and integrates some modern ideas of platforming such as grabbing ledges and using a whip to swing across gaps or climb up to higher places. The whip requires precise placement to work correctly and the timing of jumps and swings can be tricky to learn, but it beats having to stack boxes to get over a two-foot fence any day. Save often though!      Reverend Ray is a very different play. He can only do classic hop-style platforming, which means even the simplest fence can require piling of crates to surmount, a distracting thing to do in the middle of a wild shoot-out.  However, he is a great gun handler and even wears a breastplate that blocks a lot of otherwise painful shots. However, this is essential as Ray is not very fast and fighting from cover is not the easiest thing to do. However, there are few things more evocative than to walk through a town full of bad guys, shooting them down while listening to some of the best voice-acting I've ever heard in a game. Fear the wrath of Ray!       Shooting is very much a mix of old and new. The basic shooting is very old-school with lightning reloads, no ironsights, and most guns need multiple hits to kill even basic baddies. But there are more sophisticated shooting modes such as dueling mode and quick-shooting which wouldn't be at all out of place in the latest games today.       One thing that must be addressed because some gamers really get hung up about these things: there is culturally-insensitive content in this game including casual racism, sexual violence, and religious extremism. This is a spaghetti western in game form, not a documentary trying to encapsulate the truth about people in the Old West. Movie stereotypes and cliches are in full force here. Mexicans are portrayed as brutish and dishonest; Christians, both Catholic and Protestant, are intolerant and cruel hypocrites; and aboriginal Americans are either wizened animists or blood-thirsty savages. There is also plenty of bad language, much of it sexually explicit. This game is not remotely as extreme as many, but it earns its M-rating nonetheless, so parents be advised.       All that said, enjoy this first of a great franchise, one of the best western FPS ever made, and a delight.  "

												It's flawed, but has nice moments and plot twist:+The narrative is nice and funny+Alternates Action/Sneaking+Nice old graphics-The guy/horse gets stuck on corners-The men (yes, there are 2) can't jump higher than 1 cm from the ground-The indian talks like a ""niga""Give it a try!			"

												This game is pretty fun overall but it has a massive flaw: Billy Candle. In my opinion this character is the only thing really holdign this game back from being as good as Bound in Blood. Ray's levels are fun, and the shooting is satisfying, but Billy's levels ae a mixture of broken stealth and the same shooting but with a character who sucks at everything. Billy can't use guns nearly as well as Ray and can take about two hits before dying. Instead, he has to rely on a bow that slows time, but is finicky to use. Not only that but Ray's end of the story is far better, I cared about what happened to him because he is a good character. Billy's story made me irritated, primarily because he is a huge whiner who is a complete scumbag for most of the game. In the very beginning he talks abot how the sherrif of his hometown is always giving him crap, and then the first thing he does when he gets to town is steal from three different people, two of which were being kind to him. Basically, this game is good as long as you are playing as Ray, Billy can go die in a fire.			"

												The only reason I would play a 10 year old FPS is because I like Western games that much. I was looking to sate my western hunger again, and found the Call of Juarez series. It's definitely dated, but it's a good western. The fun mechanics include dual wielding guns, and ""Concentration Mode"" where you draew both guns, you get a slowed down ""bullet time"" effect to shoot multiple bad guys very quickly. The game crashed on me several times. I played it in ""Safe Mode"" for the majority of the game to ensure it wouldn't crash. It still did. But it's mostly playable. The story is good, and the voice acting is great, but the last third of the game feels like you're just doing tedious stuff to drag out the time. I played it in 11 hours. If this wasn't a western, I would have given up on it. But if you're hankering for old tiney gunslinging, I'd say it's worth it. Don't pay $20 for it though. Find it on sale.			"

												I loved the voice acting, specially Ray - there should be an oscar for him. I liked the gameplay, being able to grab different types of gun on the ground (because your current rusty gun would soon cease to function), ride a horse, shoot a bow and arrow, use the whip like Indiana Jones...I also liked the outdoor environment a lot. The lighting of the different parts of the story. And the soundtrack, too.Funny thing is, although I liked playing as Ray much better (I don´t like stealth, I prefer frontal assault), the more intense memory I´ll have of this game will be of Billy and the time the spent in his spiritual journey with Calmwater, hunting rabbits with the bow - for respect for the prey - and climbing the mountain to fetch the eagle´s feather. That was the moment I felt more immersed in the wild West world of Call of Juarez.			"

												Really great western game, the mix of the two characters you play can be annoying at times as they have set gameplay styles. But the mix can be refreshing also. It just depends which play style you like more when youa re given a choice in say Deus Ex.Played the game through multiple times. Although it says only 7 hours on record, that figure is wrong!!!

												Well, I've finally completed the game. It's not bad for its age I suppose. I love westerns and this game is very fitting for anyone who also likes this type of game. There are various weapons from the period that you can use. However, the game has obviously aged some given its time of making. The graphics for its time are reasonably good but the maps are of limited size. The linear playability isn't bad either and the scripting/story is okay. The controls are pretty responsive overall. However, there are some annoying factors about the game which obviously come as a result of it's age, such as not being able to walk around, or over boxes or bushes, not being able to skip certain cutscenes at various points and you have to play them through their entirety which can be highly annoying if you die. There are also some silly bugs/glitches such as dying before the gunfight duels even begin. Overall, though it wasn't a bad game for its age and I would recommend it to anyone who hasn't played this type of game yet.			"

												old fashioned fps game ,with some RPG action elements.the bad：bugs every,coincidently get out of the storyline,plus stupid AI,zombie like NPC.both tell you it's just a game.the trigger design is extremely ridiculous:in the first chapter,the character run to a wooden house.you can only sneek into the house by the way preset by designers.when you walk into ""unauthorized area"",the NPC knows immediately or you die in smooth rock like a bomb blows just in your body.(dont tell the everywhere existence of wall opacity)only you get in the ""right path"",even you operate just in front of the owner ,its ok.previously when i jump from SUsy's room ,you dont reach the triggering point ,the story no proceed.then every npc stand still like idiot.recently i just watched first season of the TVplay WestWorld,so i ""requaint"" this game which played in 2007. feel has A familiar atmosphere like the scene WW presents  .still recommend ,if you dont have this type ,single storyline game played,or you are just a fan of westworld like me.

												I recommend this game because overall it is pretty good, but with some reserves. First off if your like me and like to play FPS games with a controller, then like me you may get a headache trying to figure out a setup that works for you. I tried my wired & wireless Xbox 360 controller with no success. Then tried out just the Keyboard & Mouse, but the game can be too fast paced at times to really enjoy. I ended up using my Razor Tartarus & finally got a decent amount of control over the game to be playable. Plus to add to the frustration the games controls can be rather clunky at first. However with all that being said, the Storyline is really good, the gun play is alot of fun & there is a good mixture of stealth, guns blazin & puzzle solving with none of these aspects being overwhelming.

												I liked this game very much. Action is great and world looks nice. Graphics are maybe a little dated but it didn't bother me. I didn't have any technical difficulties with this game on Windows 10. Only bad thing I can come up with is that in player freedom is restricted so you can't harm innocent bystanders. It's a very good western shooter.			"

												Between a crazy old preacher running around with bullet time at his disposal to rain down fiery retribution from God and a scared half to death thief who just keeps getting deeper about fifty miles the wrong way up sh*t creek, you met with a surprisingly decent first person shooter styled in the mid 19th century. You play as both these characters, one running from a mixture of crimes he did and didn't commit and a preacher who sees near nothing but evil in the world, their contrasting characters in what limited dialogue your given give an almost bleak tone to the lawless Western expanse of the United States. More so, this game manages to be driven by both fun arcade like gameplay with a strong though cliche narrative. Now though the game is very linear, the story and gameplay keep this game standing on it's own.On the technical side, the game ran perfectly fine on Windows 10 OS 64 bit. Though I have seen others complaining the game can't run or has severe issues performing on both the Windows 8 and Windows 10 operating systems. So that is something to watch out for, I would simply recommend comparing PC specs to get a rough idea whether or not this game will be compatible for your system. But as said, I didn't have a single issue with this game running on it's highest specs at a 1600x900 resolution.Pros:-Fun arcade like gameplay-Engaging narrative, though a bit cliche-Bulletime-Moderation between use of charactersCons:-Contrived platforming sections-Too much bulletime-Difficulty curve fluctuates back and forth a lotOverall, this is a game worth playing. The graphics have aged okay though you can tell the gameplay was designed more for a controller than a keyboard and mouse, but for the most part the controls are fine. No spoilers, but I do recommend switching the sprint key for your horse from the caps lock button to shift, as that won't effect gameplay much if at all.			"

												Call of Juarez tells a cohesive narrative of two brothers who set out to avenge the murderous of their mother. The twists and turns are pretty unpredictable, and it wraps up quite nicely as a wholesome western story. They even did a great job basing the story from the points of views as the brothers – one in a traditional shoot-em-up cowboy style, while the other is more cunning in terms of clunky 2008 stealth mechanics and tedious obstacle mantling. However, I cannot recommend this game from a gameplay perspective. The whole game offers more of the same in terms of repetitive environments, and an overall lack of diversity in terms of combat. Weapons all felt the same with little variation, and enemies were too predictable. This could have been made up for if environments had engaging obstacles to surpass or they peppered more of the story into these levels, but a lack of either made it feel as if the levels were dragging on. Stealth elements were unbearable - you crouched in bushes to hope no one saw you, and the second they turned their back you were allowed to run full force in the opposite direction. But if they were facing your direction, you could be spotted even at a hundred metres away. While many games can come out alright if the story can surpass the gameplay, but even then there still needs to be a baseline level of interesting stuff to do to make it worth sticking around for. As a result, I just didn't feel that in my playthrough of the first Call of Juarez.			"
