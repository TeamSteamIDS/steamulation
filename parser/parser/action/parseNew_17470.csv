Dead Space is the unofficial Alien game we always wanted! The horrific plight of starship engineer Issac Clark aboard the U.S.G Ishimura perfectly replicates the feeling of isolation and suspense of Ridley Scott's classic, while also innovating and branching out on its own right to create an impeccable homage to sci-fi horror which continually surprises and rewards with each astoundingly well thought out design decision.Immersion is everything to Dead Space. The complete lack of a standard HUD or in level load screens, inventory and menus screens that don't pause the game and the fact you are never taken away from Issac's perspective whether during gameplay or in menus, all combines to ensure you are never taken out of the experience. I have to commend the developer for what they have done with the HUD, placing standards like health and ammo counts not on a floating display but physically on the character and weapon at hand. It is one of the most original ideas I've seen in any game for years that takes something simple and makes it elegant, and taken as a whole this is one of the most atmospheric games ever released.Gameplay is equally ingenious in that it takes something we know, in this case the shooting mechanics of a game like Resident Evil 4, and turns it on its head. Disregarding the tried-and-true ""aim for the head"" mantra, you are required to dismember the tentacle like arms and legs of your enemies piece by piece, chopping them up into limbless husks in a concise and diligent manner conserving as much ammo as you can in the process. It's as gruesome as it sounds, but more than just an all out gore fest it lends a more strategic and thoughtful approach to combat that asks you to hold still and be precise with your shots in the midst of extreme peril, which gives it a feel all its own and playing other games afterwards starkly outlines how traditional many of them are in comparison.Of course none of this impromptu surgery would be possible without one of the best weapons in video game history: the plasma cutter. A tool of Issac's trade, it shoots a beam razor sharp plasma perfect for severing the many appendages of your foes, and can be rotated for an even more exact cut. It's so good in fact that it actually forms one of my few complaints, as the other more rudimentary tools of destruction are far less interesting and practical to use, to the point I actively tried to avoid having to take them out. Thankfully after a few upgrades that became a very rare occasion, and the plasma cutter certainly is enough to make up for the lack of other useful weapons.Despite going on more than a half decade at the time of this review, this is still an exceptionally good looking game which stands testament to how impressive it was to begin with. The environments are vivid and cohesive without growing sterile, and the expert use of shadows is still unmatched by many more recent games. Reference quality sound design sells the experience, almost demanding a high quality sound system or pair of headphones to fully appreciate. The plot never intrigued me in any great amount, but like Bioshock before it much of the exposition is left in the form of audio diaries and notes which provided a great deal of backstory on the events before your arrival, and help compensate for the otherwise lackluster narrative that only barely covers the typical video game chicanery of sending you to every corner of the ship in a rather contrived manner.One final note isn't so much a con as simply something that should be stated. Despite its horror trappings Dead Space is still an action game first and foremost. After the first hour or so enemy patterns and scare tactics become easy to spot and predict, which while not detracting from the experience may disappoint some hoping to be frightened out of their wits. That said it is still very apt at getting your pulse up through the ever constant gloom and tenseness of its atmosphere, which even if it doesn't scare you should be more than enough to excite and increase your heart rate.For anyone not turned off by the extremely graphic violence, Dead Space is a must play. It excels at pulling you into its world and keeping you absorbed in it through an increadible atmophere that goes almost unmatched. With every step forward developer EA Redwood Shore (now renamed to the more fitting Visceral Games) show an acute knowledge of game design, never content to reiterate something already done without making it their own, and is does more for the horror action genre than probably any game since RE4. I was blown away with every passing moment, and cannot wait to dive into what horrors the future games hold. If you haven't already taken a trip aboard the Ishimura, there's no better time than now to do so, as I can assure you its a journey you won't soon forget.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

 Pros -Great atmosphere. -Great sound design. -Fun story and world. -Very fun and satisfying game play.  The dismemberment is incredibly well realized. -Monster design-One of the best minimalist HUD.  Cons -Can feel like one long fetch quest where everything goes wrong. -Monster diversity. -Running the game without vsync creates lights flickers due to the high frame rate at which the game runs on modern system. (fix by enabling vsync in the Nvidia control panel, in game vsync limit the game at 30fps) Neutral -Some of the mission objectives can become annoying.Great game overall, highly recommend it.			"

Shoot the limbs and dismember them. That should do the job.'Who Goes There?' — it's a science-fiction novella, written by John W. Campbell, which was adapted by John Carpenter as the 1982 famous film 'The Thing'. This phrase is well-suited as a slogan, which expresses all the essence of 'Dead Space' and emphasizes the outlines of its creators' intention.This game has the full right to be a challenger for the title of most creepy, brutal, nightmarish and atmospheric third-person shooter with horror elements of all time. 'Dead Space' stands as a perfect example of the unity of well-thought-out Sci-fi setting and a sinister survival action. Here we've got spectacular, dramatic storyline, smart gameplay, innovative design and stunning soundtrack.And although it's not 2008 now, but perhaps my review will encourage someone who hasn't yet been on the USG Ishimura decks to play this masterpiece.10/10			"

												Reasons why you should get this game -This game has an amazing 80's sci-fi/horror atmosphere and storyline. -Using stasis+the flamethrower is the most satisfying feeling in any game ever -It manages to keep you on edge, yes there are jump scares, but I found that the most terrifying moment is not knowing what creatures you will be up against next or what your next mission will entail. Reasons I would reconsider:-Would suggest using a controller for this game simply because the camera controls are a little difficult to work with.-The flickering lights don't really feel like they are flickering but more like the monitor is acting up (luckily there aren't too many scenes with flickering lights)   "

												Dead Space is, in my opinion, a good game. However, I've read many negative reviews calling the game terrible, which led me pretty confused because of how much I enjoyed playing through it. I'm the kind of guy who enjoys reading a lot of negative reviews before buying a game to see what isn't good about it, so I thought I'd dedicate a review to all people who aren't sure what to expect in this game because of reviews' conflicted opinions. No need to thank me, really. Yes, I love you too.""The controls suck""Huh... I dunno, I found they good. All I had to do was lower my mouse sensitivity in the options menu. Hey, maybe I'm a lucky dude, but even then, I'm pretty sure there's a Steam guide called ""How to fix mouse control problems"". I've also seen people complain about how Isaac takes one third of the screen, or how there's a deadzone (which never bothered me once) when it comes to aiming. My answer is : you wouldn't want to feel too comfortable playing a horror game now, would you? The limited FOV and the kinda awkward camera help the game feel scarier and more dangerous. If people call the weird camera angles in Resident Evil good game design, I don't see why this game shouldn't get the same treatment.""The game's glitchy""I haven't ran into a single glitch. While playing it, I even told myself more than once ""Wow, it's impressive how well coded this game is!"". Again, I think I probably just am a lucky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I guess. Maybe the game is trash on other systems. I heard there are game-breaking glitches, though! So you might want to save in different slots every once in a while. Never happened to me, but I guess you should watch out.""The story sucks""no""Dead Space isn't scary""...Yeah, I kinda agree with this one. Dead Space focuses a lot on disgust to scare the player, so if you're fine with the weird grotesque enemies (like me), this game isn't going to make you pee your pants. Many people call this game absolutely terrifying though, and you just may be one of these people... It depends on you. So why would people like me enjoy a horror game they don't find that scary? Answer's simple : the ATMOSPHERE. Dead Space's atmosphere is amazingly done, and even though I always knew the worst that could happen to me is some jumpscare that wouldn't be even close to making me scared (they're very predictable), I was often tense and paranoid. This is because of several things : amazing sound design, great soundtrack, good game design in general, but what really got me is the gameplay. Because if I'm not careful, enemies might just ambush me, make me use all my medpacks while I waste ammo trying to get a good shot at them, all of this using a gun I don't like because I'm trying to save ammo for that one gun I'm running low on ammunition with. ♥♥♥♥ing up has consequences in a game with limited resources. And that tension just makes the game great for me.To conclude, if you're interested in this game, just buy it. There's a refund option you can use if you've played less than two hours, so just use it if the game hasn't been working well for you. Hope you have fun♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants while cutting some necromorph limbs "

												Holy jeez this game scared the crap out of me! I love everything about this game, from the terryfying scenes to the hardcore gameplay. I really enjoyed the way the camera angles and mouse set up really lent to the scariness of the game. It causes a certain degree of panic when you know there is an enemy, but you can't find him unless you stay calm and move slowly without panicing. I really liked this game a lot and I definitely approve!!			"

												One of the best Space Horror games. Dead Space made me feel helpless & hopeless while moving forward through the unending tunnels, teeming of necromorphs...

												Yep, I'm 6 years late to the party with Dead Space, and even though it is that old, it still holds up well to being one of the most well-made games I have ever had the pleasure of playing. This is one of the few games that I was able to carry on straight into a second play through after finishing the first one. This is a third person, action, horror survival game, and you play the ever mute engineer Isaac Clarke.The scariness of the game is very much factor that dwindles as you play more and more. To begin with, every little noise kept me from turning a corner, but towards the end, the jump factor worse thin on most things. Even though the game is 6 years old, it still looks absolutely stunning, giving you plenty of chances to show off that lens flare in screenshots.  The combat can seem very difficult to get to grips with at first, but I bloody love how each part of the aliens can just blow up and be removed from the The game is locked at 30 fps until you turn off v-sync, which is on by default for some reason, although once you do turn  it off, your mouse controls become very slow and the only way I could get round this was by turning my DPI settings all the way up to max on my mouse itself. All in all, Dead Space is one of the past decades classic must play titles. Find more reviews at http://www.completingthebackloggroup.com/ "

												""The marker must be returned to the planet,IT MUST"" and to be honest i was glad that i to returned to this classic game and i really enjoyed losing my sanity all over again.I played this game when it first came out on the X-BOX 360 and at the time thought it was one of the best game's i had ever played and on finishing down loading it i was a little worried and concerned if i was still going to love it as much as i did and if after all this time i would not feel the same way about it ?????Of course i need not have worried as this game still pack's the same punch now as it did then,and still impressed me with both its jump scare's and its all together moment's of sheer horror i did not see coming the first time round and they still managed to make me jump out of my chair again this time as well.Dead Space - Official Trailer - YouTube

To most the plot wont need explaining and i wont go into to much detail here let's just say this,the game is set in the year 2508 and the USG Ishimura a ""planetcracker"" starship send's out a distress signal during a mining operation on the planet Aegis VII.The Concordance Extraction Corporation (CEC) send's the USG Kellion to investigate.After a guidance system malfunction crash'es the Kellion into the Ishimura dock (in explosive fashion),the crew set's out and tries to find other mean's of transport.As they explore what appear's to be an abandoned ship they find out it is'nt that abandoned after all,that's when the horror truely begin's for engineer Isaac Clarke, Commander Zach Hammond, and Computer Specialist Kendra Daniels as they encounter thing's that are (shall we say) no longer what they once were.The graphic's in this game are still as impressive now as they were when the game was first released (and that was 6 year's ago-and yet this game can still pack quite a graphical punch),and the enemies and the ship still look as good now as they did then.The sound and music in game are (not to put to finer point on it) amazing and really do help the scare's along and help you feel all together unnerved about your time on this haunted and possesed ship from hell.""Dead Space 1"", full HQ original soundtrack (OST) - YouTube

												9/10Overview: Survival Horror-Third Person Shooter The Good:+Graphics+Lighting+Atmosphere+No HUD makes things more immersive +I love that once you gain control of the main character, you never lose control, there are no cutscenes, cgi or anything that takes away control of the character. All the action takes place from the characters perspective and that provides an extra layer of immersion. +The game provides a great sense of pacing, slowly introducing new enemies, gameplay mechanics, locations and puzzles to keep you second guessing what's around the next corner. +Variety of weapons+Finding nodes throughout the ship as well as purchasing it in the store allows you to upgrade your weapons and suit+Combat, shooting limbs off enemies is satisfying+Monsters look, feel and act scary along with good diversity to keep combat engaging. +Variety of death animations+Sound effectsThe Average:Disappointing last bossThe story can be very predictableA few crashesThe Bad- The game has some technical issues that you should be aware about specifically regarding vsync, mouse lag, frame rates. Turn off vsync to get the best possible experience. ConclusionThis is arguably one of the best horror games to come out in the last decade. It does so many things right in the genre. I STRONGLY recommend this game to anybody who either loves survival horror games or third person shooters. "

												Dead Space is pretty cool, I guess.Set in the distant future of 2002, you play as Isaac Clarke, a man with two dads: Isaac Newton and Arthur Clarke. Unlike many Sci-Fi protagonists, Isaac is a space Engineer, which is like a normal Engineer but in space. And if EA promotional content is anything to go by, Isaac is also a golfer, a skateboarder, a mercenary, a world famous pugilist, and probably a really good kisser. One day, Isaac and friends go to fix a bunch of broken stuff aboard the USG Ishimura, a ship that's literally named ""Rock Village"". Unfortunately it does the opposite of make villages out of rocks and instead cracks planets open to eat the sweet sweet planet juice hiding inside. Ooh baby.  Unfortunately, someone opened the space zombie can and now there are space zombies everywhere.On the bright side, even though Isaac majored in engineering, he also apparently minored in being a unkillable death god from the 4th dimension because Isaac's right hook hits with about enough force to send the moon out of orbit and crashing into the planet below. When this game was still coming out back in 2008, the developers boasted that Isaac was at a disadvantage because he was an engineer and not a space marine. But Isaac still opens up more cans of Whoop A than the entire Earth military combined. It must be all that pent up space sexual frustration. Because he's in space. The most unique aspect is that, outside of maybe one or two weapons, Isaac remains in his field of expertise in terms of equipment. But then again, his first weapon is called a plasma cutter. As in a tool that cuts things with plasma. Why don't you just give him a asteroid chainsaw while you're at it? Actually, do that, that would be awesome. But outside of developer words, Isaac is a huge faker. Sure he screams at everything and runs like a girl. But at the same time the guy can quick draw and open fire like the best of them.  But lets stop talking about that hunk of murder for a moment and talk about the Ishimura itself.The Ishimura is the largest and oldest ship of it's class. Roughly 1.6 Km in length if the wiki is to be believed. When you're inside it's dark, dingy, Event Horizon inspired interior, you can actually kind of believe that people lived in there. Outside of the workbench and the machine that sells you murder tools for money. There are constant reminders that the Ishimura at one point, had it's own ecosystem and community. The ship seems to have everything from accommodations, recreational areas, movie theaters, video games, posters of products, vending machines, and even a restaurant. My favorite was the Zero-G basketball. Get dunked on, son. The Necromorphs, Daughter Space's antagonists, are gross little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Originally the inhabitants of the USG Stonetown, the necromorphs now hunt through the halls, killing anything that doesn't look like them as well as spreading this weird mossy flesh stuff that looks like the stuff I find on my toilet seat.But now that everyone is dead, outside of a few induviduals, as well as all of the angry space zombies onboard, is the Ishimura scary? Well, outside of the atmoshpere, no, not really. If anything the game is like a reverse horror story about alien lifeforms doing their best to try and stop an angry man covered in metal bits, jacked up on blue milk and packing more heat than the Detroit police department. Is Dad Space a good horror game? No. Is it fun? Yes, I would say so. The weapons are crunchy and fun to use, the enemies have enough variety to make you switch up your strategies, and there's enough bread crumbs and rewards for exploration to get you into finding audio logs and picking up space money to buy space stuff.  I'm not saying that Dude Space would be scarier if Isaac was defenseless. I happen to not enjoy horror games where you run away a bunch very fun because I'm already very good at running away from my problems. I'm just saying that maybe they should have turned it down a bit, maybe even gave Isaac less equipment but more evasion options, such as hiding or sweet slide tackles. Not even half way through the game I had to start putting health items away because my aim is as perfect as I am handsome and I was losing space for ammo in favor of the blue milk boxes. But should you play Father Area? It's a fun game, just not a scary one. I did not find myself pooping my pants or screaming really loudly for YouTube money. But I did find an appeal in going from room to room exterminating the space Vampires. It's almost like a natural selection thing.Man eat planet.Space zombies eat man.Immortal war god eat space zombie. DeDe Laboratory is on the cheap, and usually goes down in price during sales. Give the game a looksy, maybe it'll hook you in for the sequels, which I'm heading to next. It's definitely one of EA's better games, but that's probably not saying much considering the crimes they commit on a regular basis. Ded Sposs gets 8 irate space miners out of 10. Also, apparently the game had really gory death scenes but I didn't get any of those because I'm objectively the best.Just the best.The best Curator: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience "

Intro:The Dead Space games are survival horrors!! The series takes place in outer space in the 26th century. Mankind has expanded into space and colonized other planets, but Earth herself is in ecological crisis, having been drained of resources. EarthGov currently resorts to ""planet-cracking"" - the processing of mining entire planets for the recovery of raw materials, with a fleet of specially constructed space-faring vessels. However, EarthGov is investigating a second possibility. During the 23rd century, the Chicxulub crater was found to contain a ""Marker"" - an artifact of extraterrestrial origin which acts as a relay for a persistent electromagnetic field signal, with no apparent source.You are Isaac Clarke,  the protagonist and a ship systems engineer who is on a routine repair mission and hoping to make contact with his girlfriend who was stationed on the damaged vessel. Soon, all hell breaks loose and Isaac needs to survive the Necromorph scourge.A central theme in the games is the fictional antagonistic cult religion ""Unitology"". To me, there are many similarities between the fictional Unitology and the real-world Scientology, which I found interesting. (I am not a Scientologist, btw).To improve playability (this older game) in Windows 10, I used the following resources:1)  PCGamingWiki - Deadspace[pcgamingwiki.com] 2)  [Fixed] How to Fix Dead Space Mouse Lag - Solution 3)  Dead Space:: Get your game to work properlyGame ThoughtsThis was the second game I played in the Horror/Survival Horror Genre. I really enjoyed it! So much, I bought and played Dead Space 2. I will also buy Dead Space 3 when it is on sale. I only wish it was on Steam! This is the 1st game I used a controller with on my PC. I used a PS4 Dual Shock controller... I was not that accurate, so it took me a long while getting thngs done. :(I had a blast with this game. My rating system for Horror based games is: The Sphincter Factor. 1 thru 51 - Totally Open, you need surgery to fix this Muscle (game) ->5 - Totally Closed (Superb)! Tight as a well diggers a$$ (The Tops, a great game)The Sphincter Factor for Dead Space = Solid 4.5- Great replayability,- Great atmosphere, IMO,- Awesome soundtrack,- Decent story, - You can upgrade weapons and character armor, and- Boss fights were challenging (for me) and awesome!

IntroWelcome new recruit, hope you enjoy traveling through the emptiness and void of space as you traverse a deserted ship for signs of life that cried for help before their lives faded away. Once again another game that is so horrific by the end of it I hope the main character just has common sense to ask for a pay increase.AtmosphereDead Space is a great atmosphereic game that has alot of variety in enemies. While I did not find this game to be much of a ""horror"" like how I think of Amensia I did find it to be a very good action-thriller.Tools as Weapons+ Weapons and Gear can be upgradedNormally you would pick up a gun, and shoot aliens, however in this game you modify your tools to become weapons, each expressing its own style and functionality, constantly becoming powerful based how way you upgrade, really helps  blowing off limbs from alien hordes.Role as Engineer+ Repairing sections of the ship variesPlaying as a engineer feels very aethentic, repairing the ship, one section at a time feels not only rewarding but exciting, watching it come to life the further you go down the rabbit hole, while upgrading your gear along the way to avoid being overcome by the monsters laying in wait.Enemies+ Good Variety of Enemies+ Limb System adds dynamic ways to deal with enemyThere is a good selection of enemies and bosses to blow apart in this game. Brought me back to the days when games like doom had alot of variety in monsters. Their weaknesses being their limbs is also very interesting and somehow at the same time disturbing to a degree. A shame you cannot make any snowmen out of their limbs would be a real good scare for the children.ConclusionFor those who want to play a game where you play as a engineer who goes through a isolated spaceship and blast the limbs off your enemy I do not know why you are still reading this.Disclaimer: You might get so used to using tools as weapons that you go into your shed and modify everything into weapons and walk out like a berserker in a RPG fully geared to rock and load.

												One of the best triple A titles I have ever played. You are Isaac Clarke, an engineer who has traveled to a Planet Cracker class ship to fix a communication relay, your motivation, the woman you love. Things aren't so hunky dorey when you get there and what ensues is one of the best, albeit frustrating at times, survival-horror games ever made.+The game still looks beautiful 6 years after release and there are plenty of opportunities for great screenshots+Combat occasionally feels clunky but very satisfying when you dismember enemies+Overall gameplay is good and rewarding +Challenging boss fights+Resource management is challenging but adds another level of gameplay to Dead Space+When you complete the game you can start over with all of your items as well as some rewards for completing the game+/-The plot, while the storyline itself is excellent, especially the twist at the end, some parts of the game are incredibly frustrating, e.g. 'Oh great you managed to find that thing which will save us! Oh but I just realised actually it won't be good enough, go find something else'+/-Even medium difficulty is challenging at times, personally I like this but others may not+/-Creepy enemies but not a particularly scary game especially compared to DS2-Aiming while using matter cannons or while suspended by a 'large' necromorph is absolutely appalling even with a controller, very difficult to tell which way you need to move the weapon in order to get it in the right position-Mouse controls aren't great and controller sensitivity can't be changed-When using the steam overlay your normal mouse may appear in the game after using the mouse in the overlay-No achievementsVerdict:8.5This is easily one of my favourite games and I'm so glad I played it to completion.El K.

I take a deep breath. Come on, I tell myself, it's just another corner. You can't just stay here, wherever ""here"" is on this endlessly large and chaotic ship. And anyway, they'll come for you, sooner or later, here or there, so you might as well just go. Still, it takes all my resolve to move on, carefully aiming the welder straight ahead, expecting to be jumped at any moment now.Dead Space is the single most horrifying game I've ever played. It uses all the familiar horror tropes - isolation, darkness, the unknown, delusion, overwhelming odds, mistrust - and manages to not only make them believable in a sci-fi setting, but so visceral that they'll grip the player from the moment they set foot on the Ishimura. Nothing. Long corridors of nothing. Nothing but the noises, the creaks, the constant tension, the flickering lights, the many, many wall panels, each and every one fit to hide one of the horrors that crawl through the intestines of this ship, that have infected it to the core. And when they finally catch up with me, as they inevitably will, it still, STILL comes as a surprise, sending me frantically pacing backwards every time, aiming for... anything. Heads, limbs, whatever it is that keeps these monsters alive.Between all the scares and darkness, Dead Space also manages to be beautiful, almost transcendent at times. The quiet, damaged, empty bridge of the Ishimura, with its high glass panes, looking out into infinite space, for example, allowing you a moment of peace after encountering something that almost would've been the end of your journey. Space is peaceful, quiet, soothing, but it's a deceptive peace, trying to lower my defenses, distract me from the dangers that lurk all around me, just waiting or a chance to get to me. But... it's so beautiful. So calm. Can't I, just for a moment, rest among the stars, forget about the nightmare I'm in? Just for a moment...Even after all this time that I've played this game, I feel myself on occasion thinking back on it, remembering pieces, scenes, locations, sometimes dreaming about it. It's not often that anything gets under my skin like that, but Dead Space certainly did.			"

												I finally got around to this game. I played it bit by bit over time and it was quite enjoyable. Although it's in the horror genre, I didn't find it to be too scary, instead it felt like a slower-paced FPS dungeon crawler in space, which was great.I loved the theme of using engineering tools as weapons, and they made things interesting by making it more effective to dismember the enemies rather than just shooting for headshots or at the center of mass.There are a few caveats though.It is not a very good port. The mouse cursor feels terrible by default. You can fix the in-game mouse by locking the framerate to 60fps (see the PC Gaming Wiki[pcgamingwiki.com] for info) and use the keyboard for the inventory and menus. I also didn't care for the default camera view, so increasing the FOV using the Widescreen Fixer app[widescreenfixer.org] helped a lot. I set mine to +0.31.In all, it was a good game and I am looking forward to moving on in the series, hoping that a little more thought was put into the ports for the sequels.			"

												This game was released in 2008 and I am playing it for the first time here in 2015.  I have to say this is a fan-freaking-tastic game.Pros:-Graphics and textures were amazing for an older game.-The sounds and music in the game were fantastic. Made for some good scary moments. I jumped plenty of times.-Great upgrade and progression path of weapons and items.-Unique game physics and in game resource management.-Loved the 3rd person perspective.-Great weapon choices and secondary fire actions.Cons:-At times, felt a little repetitive and tedious having to always run back to the start to finish the missions.-At times, camera angles and aiming were difficult in tight corridors.-While the in game save feature is pretty unique, it got tedious constantly finding a save point and having to click through 3 screens to save.Overall, I would give this game a strong 8.5/10.I would highly recommend playing and picking it up on the next Steam sale.

												Dead Space is a game that achieved instant classic status with me. An honorary spot on my shelf.After finishing the game (which took me a while), I realized that the game had me on edge the entire time. And I mean the whole heart racing, eye wide open and sweaty palms deal.This game is very and I mean very good at maintaining an atmosphere which keeps you on the edge constantly second guessing your every move and wondering what is around that corner, that vent, that elevator.While steam only logged 30-ish hours of game play, I played my disk to death on my xbox. Literally, it has been run to the bare plastic film (May upload a screenshot later).Graphics: 9.5/10Sound: 10/10Gameplay: 9.9/10Atmosphere: 10/10I can and gladly will expand on the details of the above four catagories if you are contemplating on purchasing this game. Just simply send me a friend request and I will gladly tell it all.Bottom line: If you want to play a horror game set in deep space where no one can hear you scream, look no further for you've found the game.

												I played this game a lot when it came out in 2008. It's the scariest game in the Dead Space series. The gameplay reminded me of Resident Evil 4, the sci-fi element and horror reminded me of System Shock. Though I could never really enjoy the story or the Dead Space world, I appreciated how much work went into expanding it (mini-games, movies and books). What I enjoyed most about this game is the complete lack of UI. Without the UI the whole experience feels more like watching a movie (found footage?). I think that this is one of those games that you just have to have in your Steam Library. 


wow, such good graphics :)

This is definitely one of the best games I've played in awhile.  I can't get into horror literature (my coworker once handed me some horror book and I just laughed at what I was reading...it just sounded too ridiculous to feel real and scary), but movies and videogames handle that genre brilliantly.What I liked:-I mostly love how Dead Space handles lockdown situations....  Without spoiling too much, I'll just say there are alot of situations where the game messes with your head - it throws a curveball and acts like it's helping you...but the situation gets worse.  -Being able to enter Zero-G and Vacuum areas is also fairly unique to this game and they add a bit of flair and puzzle factor to the mix of suspense and grotesque combat.  -The weapon selection is another of my favorite features, because they look like unassuming mining equipment, but - when activated - do so much more.  What I didn't like:-Potential spoiler, hover to read --> Unfortunately, like similar games System Shock and Half-Life, there are alot of ""situations"" that aren't affected by your actions.  Alot of crew the game wants you to save cannot be saved.  This makes the game boring, even depressing to go through, since you have no control over the outcome.-I also don't like the predictability of jumpscares (they still shock me every time - but you can tell there's a pattern).  -The mouse/controller sensitivity isn't easy to adjust for a game that requires precise aim.I had been putting this game on the back burner for so long because I thought it might be too scary, but I'm glad I jumped into it.  Totally worth it! "

												Steven King, that very prolific author, delineates three types of fear. First is the gross-out, or disgust; the thing you want to get away from. The second is horror, the unkown; an aversion to things that you do not quite understand. And finally there is terror, the creepiness; when something is so close to being normal, but off by a tiny bit that makes it completely uncomfortable to look at. Dead Space wants to be scary, so it taps into all three fears. However, it ultimately relies more on disgust and the jump-scare than anything else.Dead Space is a third person survival shooter set in space. You play Isaac Clarke, an engineer sent to repair the deep-space mining craft 'Ishimura'. Unfortunately, the ship is overrun with space-zombies called necromorphs and something really shifty is going on there so your job quickly becomes to get off that metal hunk before you're brutally murdered. As mentioned earlier, Dead Space is more like a shooter than a horror game. The trope of horror is invoked, with the shadows creeping along the walls and monsters scurrying in the vents while you can only hope they don't jump you when you're looking the other way. When the horror subsides the gross-out takes over as the monsters are disgusting amalgamtions of bodyparts with claws where hands used to be and tentacles from every orifice looking to turn you into deli-meat if you don't shred them before they get in your face. Is the game terrifying at any time? Once, in a cutscene for a second or so, but when you do the math, Dead Space is a survival disgust shooter. The reason why it isn't horror is because you get a good glimpse and understanding of your foes. The necromorphs all waddle toward you and they'll let you pick them off. Dead Space does not work quite like most zombie games. Necromorphs are completely unimpressed when you behead them. No, you have to dismember them; tear them limb from limb. This creates for some cool gameplay mechanics where you'll aim for the legs to slow them down and then tear their arms off to finish the job. Yet, some enemies require a more measured approach where you have to get around them or prevent them from falling in the first place, otherwise they'll spawn more trouble. Occasionally one will get the drop on you, but you're not scared of the creeps; you're spooked, anxious and thrilled, but not fearful. You're armed to the teeth to such an extent that you only really fear for your life, and that is classified as suspense. Dead Space plays much like Resident Evil 4 and 5 in terms of controls. You aim with a laser pointer and use your ammo conservatively. You can use special powerups to slow enemies down or to throw the set pieces at them. You're a veritable slayer of monsters and everytime you gear up with new tools you start to look the part as well. What also helps the suspenseful atmosphere is the intergrated HUD. You don't have a screen overlay; your health and ammo are displayed on your character's model and interacting with the world is done in the same manner. It creates a keen level of immersion that not many shooters can attain. When all is said and done, Dead Space makes good use of its atmosphere and lighting to build suspense and to release that tension at the best moments. You're on the edge of your seat, holding on for dear life as you fight off the hordes of disgusting creatures. Even the bossfights are a well measured and carefully calculated ordeal that keep you sucked in and fighting for survival without resorting to cheap set-pieces or quick-time events. Dead Space is an amazingly atmospheric thrill shooter that needs to played if only for its amazing presentation.			"

												I know this game is quite ""old"", I think it came out in 2008 or something like that but not only until now I got around to playing it. Dead Space is possibly not a horror game for me, it has some jumpscares and sometimes when a new enemy appeared I kinda freaked out trying to learn how to defeat him. The game itself relies on the dismemberment of enemy limbs in order to kill them, it also features some puzzle ""sections"" where you need to manipulate gravity and slow down ""stuff"" using your stasis in order to complete a certain objective. The soundtrack really keeps up the rythm and the action of the game with some intense sections where the music pumps in. Now, as far as I'm aware the PC version was ported from the 360 version and somehow (I doubt it's just me) they forgot to get rid of the mouse acceleration and smoothing which really annoyed me quite some times but once you get used to it, it's all good. Now, for me, the strongest point of Dead Space has to be the story, it's kinda ""unique"" per say and I really dig into these sort of religion fanatics messing up with alien tech. Another thing I must say is that the developers really put alot of effort into making the game world ""realistic"", across the USG Ishimura you'll find various advertising panels some of which are different and I feel like those small additions to the world design really make it unique and engaging. I believe I have nothing else to say about Dead Space besides telling you to go give it a try if you haven't played or beated it yet.			"

												This is the one that started it all. Join engineer Isaac Clarke on his creepy space adventure, wherein you must fight your way through an infestation of horrid undead abominations and face off against a fanatical death cult.In order to get the game to work correctly I would highly suggest looking up what other users have done to tweak the game’s settings, as it suffers from horrible console port-itus. Here’s a quick reference for ya.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Dead_SpaceDon’t let this dissuade you from playing it however, as it is a highly entertaining, monster filled romp through the bowels of the USG Ishimura, a gunmetal grey and black mining ship that literally rips out the cores of planets for relentless human resource consumption.If you like futuristic space horror, this is one of the best.

In Space, no one can hear you squeal like a scared little B*tch!~Dead Space is one of the First Horror games that i really wanted to complete simply because of the story, although, as you read, it has more to understand than just a Abandoned Space Ship with ""Absurd Monsters""....


Dead Space 
A Screenshot of Dead Space
By: Jaeger




~This Game is a Defining Space Horror Game, although more action packed than something like Alien: Isolation but the Environment coupled with the Smart Mechanics and Formidable Enemy AI are the strong points of this EA Game!Alright let’s get Started on The Good Aspects first:Pros:+The Story is Immersive and Deep on the Scale of 3+ games. There’s much to understand, the whole cause of chaos experience in the Ishimura is not only explained in DS1 but also in other forms of media such as Books, Animated Movies, Graphics novels, a Wii Game and even a little Mobile game (How cute).  No Spoilers here but there are many things that contribute to the Plot such as that Universe's Primary ""religion"" (AKA- Cult) called Unitology.+Speaking of Story, a Bulk of the Backstory, is found from Logs within the Levels (Well Hidden of course.) This really Helps the Player (Isaac Clarke) understand Many Characters, Events and even teaches them how to play Zero-G Basketball!!+The HUD is very Realistic; it is Projected outwards in front of Isaac's face when he walks. Want to Rummage through Ammo while a battle is happening? You will most likely Die...+The Difficulties are very balanced for the types of gamer out there, from a simple run and gun easy difficulty with lots of supplies (i find it too many) to the Impossible mode which has fewer checkpoints, OP Enemies, hardly any Supplies (Just the way i like it), Bad Starting Suits, Few upgrades and a loss of that checkpoint instantly if you close/exit the game at all. That’s for the Hard-core Gamer who prefers a true horror Experience.+Loading Times? Where?+Atmosphere is undoubtedly the game’s biggest Strong Point. an almost empty ships filled with Necromorphs ( which are actually the ships deceased crew that, due to an Alien Virus, have Transformed into Bloodthirsty Recombinated Necromorphs!....Its complicated.) that seem to be around every dark corner (There’s quite a few!) The Metallic Clang of Claws in a vent above you, or the Creaking of the Hull, or Heavy Thuds from the Asteroid belt pelting the ship are all some prime examples of how well the game deals with the unique atmosphere. It’s a Mix of Event Horizon, The Thing and even System Shock 2!+Scares a-plenty!+Extremely Innovative targeting Mechanic= Strategic Dismemberment, go for the Limbs..+Sound is Very Realistic and Proportional, some moments you have to stand still and be quiet to hear where the necromorph is crawling...Can you hear that too?+Weapon Options are plentiful+Interesting Currency and requirements to get some Credits+Upgradable Suits (up to 6 levels!)+HUD is very informative, you will hardly ever get lost with the 3D map Design+New Game Plus Ability (Definietely Worth it)+Boss Battles are Excellent and each are around the right length as well.Huge Alien Creatures vs Puny Engineer with a Bulky Suit but Heavy Weapons and  Badass ""Gadgets""= Interesting/Gory Results!+Death Animations, Mortal Kombat meets the Thing! Blood will be spilled, then  poured and then Splashed! (R18 for this reason!)

Cons:-The Story is handled very slowly, which is bad for fast paced gamers. Easy to  Normal Mode should be the Right speed for most players.-By Default, the Mouse Sensitivity and Smoothing is Very awkward and irregular.-Crashes during Big Battles, with lots on the screen. Very rare though.-Linear Levels with little Variaton. Although you are on the Ship it would be  nice to see differently themed levels.-Lack of Interactive Items in levels-Many Collectibles can be too Difficult to find in 1 or even 2 playthroughs,  guide recommended.-Save File can be Overwritten Accidentally due to placement when you are  saving!!-Characters are hardly touched apon in detail. Little Emotional Connection  between the Player and Isaac! (Which is not good, because of his Motivations)-No Co-op, would have added a slightly more action feel. (Good and Bad)-No Achievements, Minor really.-Graphics issues include: Stuttering,Frame Drops and bad resolution by default.-Backtracking during the early parts up the Middle is really irritating!Final Thoughts?It has lots of replay value with suits and upgrades to try outBut id recommend buying during a sale since its been out for about 8 Years!!  (Already??)Its a Good Game just By Itself without the Sequels to steer the Underlying  Plot. (This is Because the other 2 PC games are more action orientated) Definetely a Wise choice for a Horror game Fan/Collector.It has aged well too, using many innovative features that would be on the level  of many horror games today!Isaac Clarke the Everyday Engineer turned Space-Hero, has a Realistic Feel to  it that fits well with the Plot.Final Score: 8/10!...Now wheres that Peng??-Kyle

												If it's lying on the ground, kill it. Don't matter if it looks mangled beyond recognition; if it's lying on the ground, you kill it with everything that you've got.That's the first and basic rule of Dead Space: a game that's full of horrifying surprises around every corner. This game is so scary, you'll feel relieved upon meeting that one random guy, banging his battered head against the wall. Everything that moves either wants to decapitate you, or make you one of their own - and those resilient beings will stop at nothing to get to you, unless you tear off their pointy limbs apart from their fast-moving bodies. The Necromorphs can crawl through the vents, and appear out of the blue - ready to pounce at a moment's notice. And what better man to face them than a hardened engineer who fights these abominations with space shop tools? Isaac Clarke acts like a desentisized shell for the player, lacking emotions and words to speak, with only one goal in mind: to find his girlfriend. In short, he's the perfect horror everyman - and he's too in love to let the undead freaks get in the way to his sweetheart.And there you have it.			"

 ""In space no one can hear you scream.” Dead Space represents a great third person shooter experience with intense horror elements and interesting combat mechanics. It is very atmospheric with ambient creepy sounds and music, which will keep you on edge. The slow-paced movement of the protagonist also contributes to the immersive atmosphere.The other large appeal of Dead Space is the combat system. Instead of going for the typical headshot, it introduces the strategic dismemberment. You must cut off certain limbs to kill your enemies, which is a welcomed variety within the shooter genre to unlearn the headshot.The absorbing storyline is another strength offered by the game, especially the background story profits from it and is continued in Dead Space 2.  Trivia: The weapons in Dead Space are mostly improvised from mining tools, such as a plasma cutter, rotary saw, a hydrazine torch (repurposed flamethrower), a high-energy contact beam, and a force cannon that emits powerful shock waves. Achievements: The game has no Steam achievements.

												I got this game years ago on another... online... game distrobution platform. A friend told me to play because I love horror games. I played the first few chapters and was so stressed out I ended up taking a break for over a year! I finally finished the game a few months before Dead Space 2 came out. It still stands out as THE most stressful, scary, and panic inducing games I have ever played.Even though it's ""old"" it has aged well and even through all the blood and gore, it's still beautiful. Dig into the story and you'll enjoy this even more. Dead Space is the only game series that I've geeked out hard enough to read books about, it's that good. I hold the DS series at the top of my list of best games, right along with the Half-Life, Portal, and Mass Effect games.			"

												After beating this game, I can honestly say, I have no clean underwear.  There are a few annoyances though with this game on PC.  -You need to cap your FPS at about 120 otherwise you will run into various issues-using the ingame vsync options creates a HUGE amout of input lag-the y-axis on your mouse moves slower than your x-axisOther than the game being just old with issues listed above, the game is amazing.  Definitly with going through the fixes to play it.			"

												Dead Space is a survival horror game. You are slow moving with jump out and scare you moments. The character Issac controls slow and clunky. Plus your character Issac Clark takes up a lot of the screen, which I guess happens in a lot of over the shoulder shooters. You want to see what's behind you. Since this is an over the shoulder shooter, things can easily sneak up on your left side, even more so than behind you.The game drips with atmosphere, horror and gore, but it doesn't feel scary. Maybe I'm just used to horror games, or maybe its the fact when you run through a dead enemy, you kick it like a soccer ball and it flops like a rag doll fish. That's probably why Doom 3 had its dead enemies burn into nothing. With Dead Space, the idea is that enemies can still be alive... when they look dead. The game looks awesome and makes great use of lighting and shadow. You won't be in dark areas so much as dim areas with lights shining through vents. It has a great look to it.Dead Space boasts strategic dismemberment, such as first cutting off a leg of an enemy, before you cut off its head. If you cut off its head, it will blindly swing at you. If you cut off its leg, it will crawl and lunge at you. Most enemies are like this. Other enemies might explode with smaller, more annoying enemies if you're inaccurate. There are also reanimating enemies that take priority, because they'll monsterfy every dead body in the room. So if you're the type of gamer that likes aim over put more bullets into it, this game is for you! The enemies will even work their way through vents if you've gone to another room and they'll pop out. The vents are pretty easy to spot, but a lot of vents are on the ceiling. There are four major weapons in the game, the line cutter, flame thrower, plasma rifle and some sort of saw gun. It is unfortunate that you'll end up primarily using the weapon you start with for the entire game. That feels like a wasted opportunity. The flame thrower feels extremely weak if not completely useless.You're able to collect items, like health, ammo, air canisters for when you're walking in space and its all contained in your limited inventory. When you upgrade your 'rig' (suit), you can carry more stuff, but for the most part, since everything is sellable, you'll rarely run out of room. As the game starts, there is plenty of ammo, but at around six hours in, ammo gets scarce, but you can still buy more. Lack of ammo comes from missing vulnerable points of enemies and having them explode into smaller points.You'll also pick up node modules to upgrade things and if you start upgrading your line cutter, then why would you ever switch to a different weapon? Plus, any ammo that you get for other weapons, you can just sell at one of the game's stores for credits that you can use to buy more line cutter ammo. There are locked rooms that you can use a node to get into, but since nodes are one of the most valuable and costly items in the game, it might not be worth the risk to see what's in the mystery room. You'll also be able to explore and find items in cabinets, lockers and smashable boxes, but you really can't wander too far off the beaten path.Traversing the USG Ishimura feels like there is plenty of back tracking, with some getting lost. Luckily there is a 3D slightly difficult to use map. For the most part, each level is contained into branching segments, you'll start at the root of the map tree, clear out one branch and all of its limbs, end up at the root / hub of the level, then go for the next branch area. Sadly some of the 'chapters' reuse levels. The USS Ishimura is a big space ship, and I would call it similar to Metroid-Vania-ish since you'll revisit areas of a ship, but its all broken into 'chapters' that you can't return to unless its in the storyline to return to that section.There are some puzzles, but nothing major. You'll get powers like telekinesis to move objects and a slow down stasis to solve puzzles and get through areas. Without the puzzles, the game seems easy even on normal difficulty.The game has a very painful key binding system, especially for lefties. While you can rebind keys, you can't rebind all keys, so I recommend just using a controller. The controller works great and has simple controls for a complex system. You've got buttons for run, inventory, aim, stomp (to downed enemies and boxes), melee attack (which seems useless), use button and the D-pad will call your 4 weapons to switch. When you're aimed at something, you can reload, fire your weapon. alt-fire, use telekinesis or stasis to slow anything down.Thankfully save points and checkpoints are everywhere. It keeps the game progressing, but another negative of the game is when you run out of ammo or health and just can't pass a section, you're locked into that section. When you're stuck, you've got two choices, run all the way back to a store at the start of a level, or sometimes you might just have to restart from a save point. This is why I can understand EA's desire to throw micro transactions into the game. If you get stuck with no ammo, no credits and only have 1 save file, you might literally have to restart the game. When you get 10+ hours in, that will kill your desire to play.In all, the game feels good to play, despite how slow it is. If you enjoy typical space horror with the plot of Aliens, this game is for you! The game has been $5 on Steam and free on Origin. Chances are if you wait, there will be a sale, a bundle or a free download.			"

												I have played Dead Space across three separate platforms (PS3, XB360 and PC) clocking in over 300+ hours. One might say I have an obsession with the series and I can say with certainty that this game is worth buying, especially during a salePositives:- A compelling story which begins the epic franchise that has spanned 5 games (including Extraction and Dead Space IOS), 2 movies, 2 novels and 2 graphic novels- Fully immersive game mechanics. No HUDs, no pause while looking through inventory, all character data is displayed on Isaac Clarke's RIG in real-time, all 'cut scenes' happen in real time- Diverse weapons each with a primary and secondary fire mode, plus two tools to help in combat; Kinesis, which allows you to pick up and hurl objects; and Stasis, which slows enemies and dangerous objects- A terrifying and grotesque foe who are as varied as they are aggressive, who are capable of tactical adaption- Zero Gravity environments that change the dynamics of gameplay and how you fight- Rich and detailed environments with atmospheric ambient noises and music- New Game + which allows you to carry on your fight with all your previous gear and upgrades- The option to run game higher than 30fps on PC - please see below for issues howeverNegatives:- The port is not without faults. You are either locked to 30fps or, by disabling Vsync, unlimited fps but with physics issues- Poor M/KB compatibility and what appears to be command delay for controllers- Linear gameplay that begins to stagnate after one or two playthroughs- New Game + does not allow you to change difficulty level- DLC available on console absent from Steam. While not necessary I dislike content exclusivitySolutions:- Both of the first two negatives can be fixed, please consult the Steam Forum for solutionsConclusion:An absolute must for fans of great third person action games but especially for fans of Horror. Horror is a niche market in video games these days with fewer and fewer contributions to its genre. This might be from a previous generation of games but it still stands tall with the best of them in my opinion			"

												One of the greatest horror games of the last generation, for sure. Dead Space builds up suspense and tension, using a sci-fi environment, a creepy atmosphere, and lots of blood. You play as engineer Isaac Clarke, who goes on a routine mission to repair a damaged spaceship. Obviously the mission isn't so routine, and it's up to Isaac to find his girlfriend Nicole and escape with the rest of his crew. The enemies are known as the Necromorphs - humans who have changed into hideous creatures. Over the course of the game you will find new weapons, armor, and upgrades to help you along the way. Just be sure to stop playing the series at two; Dead Space 3 is a whole new kind of monster...			"

★★★★★This game is about to be 10 years old. If you never found a chance to play it, just try and do it. Same goes with the arguably better Dead Space 2.This first installment is really well designed. To the enemies, the hud, the varied gameplay, the hallways (look at my profile for some screenshots of these), the combat, it looks like the team thought it all out and took the right amount of care for it. The only cliché you can't ignore while playing this, are the blood-written texts on the wall, which is since then overused by today indie developers.I should notify buyers that the devs never fixed the flashing lights issue when you play on unlimited FPS. It's not an huge issue, especially since its mostly only in the first chapter (of 12). The mouse sensitivity also doesn't work as desired at first since it's really low. Their are some easy work-arounds, and if you don't want to deal with that, you can always play with a (xbox one) controller.One serious con with this PC version is the lack of achievements, which were a joy to hunt on the 360/PS3 version. Nevertheless, it's a great game. Pick it up when its on sale, because it's often discounted with 50%.			"

												TL;DR: Intense sci-fi horror with great atmosphere and solid gameplay mechanics; an old gem that still holds its own.For a player that was never interested in survival horror Dead Space was still attractive due to its setting and premisis. Having played it a long time ago on console and now revisiting it on PC, this game is still fantastic for old and new fans of the genre.Positive features:-Genuine horror elements-Satisfying gun play with a different range of weapons and upgrades-Graphically impressive and well optimised-Interesting story with detailed backstories found in game-Good UI and item management systemNegative features:-Occasional backtrackingTo conclude Dead space is a great game with a combination of horror and action, a classic, that deserves a play for any fan of survival horror and even new comers who are brave enough to try it.

""It's strange... such a little thing.""- Nicole BrennanSome games are what you'd call inspired. Others wear their inspirations on their sleeves. Then there's the games that are just their inspirations.Dead Space manages to be the latter, and still be more than the sum of its parts.Dissecting its frankenstein nature, you'll find a setting that's 3 parts Event Horizon, 1 part Alien, with enemy types from The Thing, with gameplay straight from RE4 and colour filters straight from the Discount Cellophane Garbage Disposal. EA Redwood, now Visceral, adds something to this derivative slurry, and that's commitment. Sheer belief in a butcher's vision carries Dead Spare where so many of its peers have failed. The dedication to aesthetic - where absolutely every player interaction and HUD is justified and explained ingame - if nothing else adds one metric hell of an aesthetic. One of videogame's best GUIs is joined by some remarkably decent levels, that's never too mazelike nor too streamlined, which breakneck pacing sees you speeding through to great production values and lab-brewed SFX that manages to make lazer guns - traditionally the most pew pew of weapons - hit hard and hit heavy.""Make us whole again.""- About half the NPCsEnemy variety is much more than you'd expect. You have your worthless mook, your ranged mook, your fast mook, your faster mook, your fat pregnant tank mook who'll explode into a horde of ""Up yours"" fleshbugs who treat your health bar like candy while calling you Daddy, and a couple of minibosses besides.You're given enough tools and mechanical aptitude that no situation feels like it's forcing you to take damage. From your comically-overpowered stasis to begin able to sprint backwards, to that every shot hitstuns an enemy for more than enough time to get past it, it hits all the right marks.But post-industrial blood-splattered wonderland that Dead Space is, it's certainly not perfect.The bosses suck. Shoot the big yellow glowing points at a midranged distance on our generically gory-looking fleshblobs. I'm fairly sure at least two of them are impossible without the hitscan weapons.Speaking of which, half the weapons are absolute garbage. Sure, Line Gun, Pulse Rifle, Plasma Cutter, more than carry the game. But the Flamethrower and Disc Ripper are infamously awful, with the Force Gun not lagging far behind. The divide in usefulness is so wide it boggles the mind how this reached final release.""I will leave you with my child.""- Dr. Mercer before unleashing Dead Space's NemesisThe incentives to play multiple times are also pretty thin. There's not enough ability to explore or to deviate from the norm to really justify just going through again, the bonuses that exist are just there to make an already easy game easier. Although there's Impossible Mode, which is nice if you like only using the Plasma Cutter ever and having enemies sidestep enough to star in a Thriller video.Most ingrained problem of all, though, is that the actual horror aspects just aren't very good. It mostly just amounts to enemies jumping out of vents - only vents - and screaming you in typical monster closet fashion, which is hack talk for ""please be scared"". Although some people couldn't finish the game due to being too scared, so what do I know.Now, this is a PC port. And not a fantastic one. The control issues are fairly infamous, and even once you apply the fixes it's fairly janky to get used to. Disable V-Sync, jack mouse sensitivity to full, navigate menus with keyboard only, treat actually aiming like ironsights and you have a setup, that while it takes some getting used to, makes the game a fair bit easier than it ought to be.There's a couple of inherent quirks - not being able to strafe diagonally, or that you can't initiate a reload while walking but it's fine to walk while reloading. Odd little details like that, that once you adjust to aren't an issue. Certainly not insurmountable issues for a PC port, and this is a PC port worth playing.""Cut off their limbs.""- wall graffiti, followed by an audio log, followed by an ingame conversation, followed by a tutorial promptDead Space is a mechanically-decent aesthetically-driven game that has a dream, or at least a nightmare, to share and does it well. It's definitely worth your time.			"

Posted: July 9, 2015
												A classic example of atmospheric horror that will, surely, stand the test of time and remain as one of the best horror games,  and one of the best sci-fi games, I've ever played. I have a lot to talk about for this one kiddies, so grab some popcorn or something. I won't spoil anything for you either, so don't worry about that, if you haven't beaten the game yetSOUND:____First and foremost: One of the most important pieces of any horror game is effective sound design. I didn't notice it as much on my first playthrough, sadly, because I only played in Stereo, but I went back recently and replayed the whole game in Surround Sound, high volume, with headphones, and oh boy, did I have a lot of pants to replace. Players aren't going to jump if a group of Necormorphs ambush them while the Betty Hill theme is playing in the background, likewise, the whispers you can hear throughout the ship wouldn't be as effective if they were accompanied by a vuvuzuela. In that sense, this game exceeds all expectations. They use just the right sound, every click, inhuman gurgle, and automated announcement falls so perfectly into place that you'll surely be looking over your shoulder.Again, to experience this, play at high volume with surround sound headphones. I guarantee you, the difference in fear is like night and day. On my first playthrough with just stereo, that I did years ago, I didn't even flinch once at any scares, on my most recent playthrough, with surround sound, I cried at least five times.The soundtrack is scary enough that even listening to it out of the game makes me feel like I should be on edge, looking over my shoulder. Beautiful composition, that fits perfectly with the world established by the game.The sound aspect of Dead Space scores a 10/10 from me. Suberb job, every audio-design student should play this at least once to see how much of an effect using sound correctly can have on a person's experience. It's the difference between confidently strolling down a corridor and hesitantly walking down it, moving your legs oddly as your legs are soaked in fear-urine.____GRAPHICS:___By graphics, I don't mean 'oh look how high-definition this texture is!"", I feel like people put too high of a value on that. A game can have 1080p textures and still look like digital vomit. No, what I mean is how appealing a game looks, the over-all design and how it flows together, immersing you.Dead Space's graphics are as good as the sound: They make you paranoid, even. The subtle way the gray hallways seem to endlessly blur together, mixed with the scratching of something following you, will make most people, myself included, feel intensely claustrophobic. It's beautiful how every texture, every object, seems to flow into eachother, all of them playing into the theme that 'I really, REALLY shouldn't be here"". From the uncanny way the monsters still retain 'just' enough of their human appearance, to the way certain vents blend into the floor so you can't tell a monster may pop out, to the way the lighting may be just dim enough you dread the idea something may pop out, Dead Space has got you covered.The Ishimura feels like a real ship, every deck feels just unique enough, yet consistent enough you can tell it's part of the same ship. It serves to further create an atmosphere of tension and loneliness.Dead Space's graphics get a 10/10.____GAMEPLAY:____Dead Space's gameplay is superb, but not a 'perfect' experience by any means. There are both pros and cons to the resource management. While at times it can correctly make situations more tense, at other times it just raises my blood pressure and makes me want to punch my monitor.It's a mixed bag as far as resource management goes, while the combat remains fairly standard. It's a point, click, you're dead kind of deal, with very little variation between the best ways to dispatch monsters. There isn't much to say about the gameplay, it's average. 7/10.___STORY (No Spoilers: Don't worry)___I'm going to be vague here to avoid spoiling anything, but the story of Dead Space is an emotional rollercoaster, and I craved more, and more as time went on. I was truly interested in fully understanding what went on on the Ishimura, and learning all I could about the crew who manned her. Furthermore, seeing how the characters interacted actually played out quite nicely, and their treatment of eachother was rather realistic. I myself have seen work environments where people act like that in real life, so it was refreshing to see actual human-like characters.The mystery, suspense, and all out dread is flawless. It has an odd balance where not knowing what's happening is horrifying, but understanding exactly what's happening is JUST AS SCARY. It's a weird trait that I don't see too often in horror games anymore. Most of the time, when you learn the mechanics behind the monsters in a horror game, their motives, their origins, it removes some fear, it grounds them into a Earthly point of view where you can try to understand. But in Dead Space, it's like the more you understand the more otherworldly your situation truly seems. It'll keep you on the edge of your seat. This is a game where you HAVE to read all the text logs and listen to the audio-logs, or else you'll miss a big chunk of the experience, and believe me when I say all of the video/audio/text logs are written well enough that they're juicy and will leave you pondering them. Dead Space has one of my favorite game universes of all time, and for that the story gets a 10/10.___OVERALL:___Overall, Dead Space is a stellar (Heh, see what I did there?) example of a truly genius execution of the decades old concept of being stranded in space with monsters all around. May Dead Space long live as an example to both the sci-fi and horror game developer and player communities as an example of when things are done right. For decades to come, I imagine Dead Space will still stand as one of the best horror games ever made, and THE best horror game franchise that EA's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t marketing ever ruined.9.9/10And remember, there's always Peng.

+ The gameplay is very enjoyable. Dead Space is a third person shooter that is someonewhat comparable to Resident Evil. You must conserve ammo, and learn how to kill creatures efficiently.+ The zombie-like monsters called ""Necromorphs"" are absolutely terrifying. Some of the scariest monsters I've ever seen. Unlike other horror games, it's not as simple as shooting them in the head, you must dismember their arms and legs or they will keep coming after you.+ Very atmospheric horrifying sounds throughout the entire game that constantly keep you on the edge of your seat. + Surprisingly good story. Not to spoil too much, you are sent on a repair mission to a deep space mining ship. They have uncovered some sort of artifact that is causing people to hallucinate and transform into nightmarish creatures. There is also 2 Animated movies Dead Space Downfall and Aftermath which I'd encourage you to watch.+ ~10+ Hours of Content~ You will need a controller to play this game properly, the mouse sensitivity is a bit off- A bit too many jump scares. After a while I started to get paranoid, and felt like something was going to pop out in every room. Some people may enjoy this, but it was a big turn off for me and prevented me from completing the game for many years.			"

												Dead Space can be considered a modern classic for survival horror genre or just a bland sci-fi shooter with horror elements. What ever you might think, you can admit that this game does have a decent gameplay and good atmosphere at some points. Weapons and armor look cool and are indeed memorable. Killing necromorphs is fun and sci-fi weapons make it even more fun. The game still does have a fair share of issues. PC version has poor performance for relatively old game and is buggy, but the amount bugs in play sessions changes. I had a invisible wall when I opened the door (at the first chapter in fact) and I couldn't get through, so I had to change some settings (I can't remember what I did, but you can find out yourself) to fix it. Another bug was in zero-gravity outside the ship where there was asteroids hitting the ship and you had to avoid those by getting into cover. You also had to jump to the walls because of cover and oxygen canisters, but my character somehow didn't land on it and stopped and died for no reason. I had to land much more carefully to avoid it. When I was a bit younger I stopped playing it because of this issue. I didn't understand, what I was suppose to do at the time.WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!  This game does have a story which has a lot of clichees. Characters aren't that good and it doesn't help that your main character, Isaac Clarke, is mute. They added voice later on with the sequels gladly, but his personality wasn't that interesting, but still OK. I should still say that the foundation of Dead Space is great. Humanity is lacking resources and for that reason, they built planetcrackers that can go into lightspeed and then grab a huge part of the planet/moon/asteroid to mine it and gather all the resources. There's also a cult with large amounts of members who have their own devious plans. Good setup, but the story of characters is lacking and could've been better.  If you're new to horror genre, this game might be scary to you. Though it's possible that if you're an active gamer, you'll notice the patterns in Dead Space. This review might sound too cynical to have a recommended status, but I should say that this game is good overall and you should try it if you're into shooters or horror.I wrote this review because I didn't have anything else to do, so it might be a bit messy. I do hope that my review was readable and easy to understand.(As always, I might do mistakes when writing text in english, so apologies for any mistakes I made)			"

												This game is truly a horror masterpiece. The special about it is that Isaac isn't a soldier trained to kick♥♥♥♥♥but an engineer trained for fixing stuff. Going into a battle for survival against aggressive Necromorphs is always a terrifying experience. Do yourself a favor by playing Dead Space only in a dark room with headphones to experience the true horror. The only part I dislike about it is that it makes you feel edgy almost all the time knowing that danger lies around every corner.P.S. Playing the game with a controller is strongly recommended (for smoother aiming) and also please choose hard difficulty.GG!			"

												Dead Space is an action oriented survival horror game.You are Isaac Clarke, an engineer that is part of a rescue team. Your mission is to repair the spaceship USG Ishimura, a huge mining vessel that carves out chunks from planets and harvests the valuable ore. Shortly after they arrive on board all hell breaks loose. Their craft is destroyed, leaving them stranded on the Ishimura. The crew is attacked by nightmarish creatures. Seperated from the others it is up to Isaac to wander the halls, search for any friends or survivors that are still alive and fix as many problems as he can until he can find a way to escape the ship.The setting is where the game shines. It definitely feels like you are in deep space. There are sections in a vacuum, things sound differently as you would expect if you were in an airless environment. You also have a small air supply that will run out if you are not quickly. There are other parts where there is no gravity and you can leap from floor to ceiling or walk up the sides of a wall. A cool aspect is that there is no HUD. Health is displayed on the back of your suit and ammunition is displayed when you hold up your weapon. Another interesting feature is the holographic screens that appear throughout the ship and when someone is talking to you. All elevators and doors have one of these screens instead of a standard switch. The graphics are good. It has great lighting effects, textures, and models.The sounds also really help with the immersion. You will sometimes hear random clanking, footsteps, or alien grunts and shrieks that keep you on your toes. The music gets intense when you are under attack by a group of aliens and is kind of spacey when you are just exploring alone. Overall, if you like blood, gore, horror and action you should try Dead Space. There might be too much action in this game for the old school survival-horror fans but it should still be ok for them.Sounds 9/10Graphics 9/10Gameplay 9/10Atmosphere 10/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												Overall score = 8/10Dead Space is a wonderful game combining many genres, third person shooter, survival, action, and horror, all into on. While some games fail when trying to do too much, Dead Space is able to do all of these parts well and deliver a satisfying experience from start to finish.Dead Space progresses very nicely from start to finish. The story is intriguing and, while horrifying space creatures is nothing new, presents a well rounded and detail/lore filled experience that took some thought to follow. The opening sequence leads very nicely right into the action, immediately making you want to find out just what happened to that ship. As far as firefights go, this game offers some intense sequences. Whenever I overcame a hoard of enemies I felt like a badass, but I always hoped that an engagement like that wouldn't happen again. This may be what Dead Space does best: present you in an environment that makes you uncomfortable, leave you feeling exposed at all times, and give you just enough to get the job done if you do it right and think on your feet. That being said, I found the biggest flaws in the game to also center around the combat situations. While there are plenty of action sequences in the game, it is not as smooth as other action games, which is of course fine as this isn't the initial purpose. However, some sequences and enemies felt cheap to me when you meet them. The enemies are varied, challenging, and interesting as a whole, but some sequences are downright frustrating. Often this happens when an objective is not fully clear or your purpose is not adequately explained. I don't expect a game to hold my hand, but when it isn't clear what that button you just pressed does, but swarms of enemies come out of the vents, it can become exhasperating. Fortunately, this doesn't happen too often.The progression system in Dead Space is very good and rewarding. You can build your loadout to your playstyle and upgrade equipment to suit your strengths. Dead Space offers a variety of weapons to use and tactics to implement to keep battles fresh and fun.I would definitely recommend Dead Space, even though it is a few years old. It is still a great game, and at a discount during Christmas or summer for $5 simply can't be missed.			"

												Who is this Game For?==================Fans of Horror, puzzling stories and third person shooting will find a lot to like about Dead Space. The story in Dead Space is one of its strong points. It tells a great cinematic sci-fi action horror tale. You can definitely see the inspiration from films such as Event Horizon, Aliens and The Thing.Is it good?=================A lot of this atmosphere is due to the brilliant sound effects. The voice acting is good, but it's the background noise that really gets to you. Hearing monsters crawling around the air vents, or the growling of something possibly watching you, all adds to the level of tension and fear - especially during the quieter moments in the game, or outside the ship in the emptiness of space. The graphics help, too - this is a very impressive looking game with excellent lighting.Does it have any problems?========================Another thing that starts to kill the scare factor is the few times when you run into other people still alive (usually not for long) on the ship. These are always scripted sequences where you find someone and almost at that exact moment they either kill themselves (they've clearly gone nuts) or get killed by something else. This is fine a few times, but after a while, it's just a bit much and starts feeling too convenient and a little bit fake.As for PC ports go, it’s not the worst, but it does have its problems. There are problems with mouse lag, and running the game at higher frame rates. A lot of people still report audio shudder and crashing at desktop. All these problems can be fixed with a bit of tinkering (http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Dead_Space) but I would still recommend playing the game with a controller.Final Thoughts!====================Dead Space is one of best Survival Horror releases in years. Tense, violent and incredibly aggressive; playing it at night with a loud 5.1 sound system can provide you the most spectacular scare moments of your life. It is a potentially great game that's hamstrung by an attempt to completely ape a console controller with a mouse and keyboard. "

												In my opinion, Dead Space is one of the best horror/shooter games out there, with just the right amount of atmosphere and jump scares. It focuses on a unique dismemberment mechanic, and trying to cut off enemiess legs while they charge you is always a rush. This game is more the spiritual successor to System Shock than Bioshock, which uses an upgrade system that makes your choices matter. There isn't as many utility skills as System Shock, but which weapons you choose to level up with your very limited upgrade nodes changes your playstyle. Just a few flaws specific to the Steam version: mouse acceleration is terrible in this game and you can't disable it within the settings. There's a fix you can download from pcgamingwiki which makes it bearable again, but it still feels off, especially using the mouse in menus. Also, once the mouse is fixed, the precision aiming makes the game much easier than intended. I originally played this on the 360 and I recall it being much more difficult. Enemies that would take 4-5 shots now go down in 2 well-placed shots, which also makes ammo too abundant. Still, it's a great game that aged well in the nearly decade it's been out.			"

Because of this i found myself jumping everytime they'd pop out and be carefully looking around each corner.  Im excited to check the rest of the series cause i really enjoyed this game 8/10			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: EA Redwood Shores Publishers: Electronic Arts Initial release: Oct 2008Genre: Action, Horror#Worth/NotWorth: #WorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationDead Space is a horror game. In where you play as our reluctant and intrepid hero Issac Clarke, a technician. Sent to the USG Ishimura, a Planet-Cracker class ship designed for mining. Upon arrival, Issac and friends have a bit of a tift actually docking with the Ishimura. After avoiding near death almost immediately upon introduction. We find ourselves upon the ship ready to get to work; Only no one is responding to our radio hails. Entrance into the first room, we are attacked by monsters later given the name Necromorphs and being the consummate professional that Issac is we decide to continue to repair the ship regardless of it's now infested alien presence. And so it begins...It's not a terribly in depth game. It is indeed your basic walk through hallways and shoot anything that moves sort of affair. But it's an effective and atmospheric one even still today. Is it contrived that in a world that requires you to dismember enemies you're given a plasma cutter that is effective at range and presumably your character would know not only how to use  it but an expert in his field? Yes, it is. The story is more in depth, I feel, than most horror. Creating a universe rather than “an experience”. Without saying anything specific, the game makes commentary on the frivolity of desperation in the creation of a new religion based almost exclusively on not knowing something. The game does feature what I'd consider “insanity effects” but they are more scripted than ambient. Throughout the game Issac does not speak. Sometimes awkwardly not saying anything but mostly this is reminiscent of the Gordon Freeman effect wherein it allows the player to place themselves more into the role. Now, at this point I should mention this is my 3rd play-through of this game and that I have also completed the rest of the trilogy. The series takes a direction that I am both happy with and thought could have been better. But that is neither here nor there. This is the beginning of that adventure. Mechanically, it's a shooter with a camera made popular by Gears of War and Resident Evil 4. It was also made in a time that “immersion” was all the rage. The HUD appears entirely “in-game” meaning that all feedback normally given to the player (Health, power for abilities, ammo count, inventory) are all made visible in-world to the characters themselves. You collect power nodes used for upgrading either your suit or weapons. The big mechanically unique thing regarding this game is the Zero-gravity areas. They are interesting, at the time they may have been more impressive but they stand to be a pretty standard element. Sound design is excellent, walking into the vacuum of space is always an incredible feeling hearing only the muffled shuffles within your own suit.Now, there is a section of this game that is borderline game breaking. It's one of the more egregiously needless frustrating sections of a game I've ever seen. Which incidentally speaks volumes to the rest of the game. I don't want to say exactly what it is, I get that it's supposed to be a stressful situation but I know a number of people that actually stopped playing the game because of that section. Addressing more topical issues, the game has full gamepad support and there is no issue with this. However, if you desire to use mouse and keyboard you'll notice that even at max sensitivity the controls are as though they are stuck in quickly hardening mud. (I used a 1600DPI mouse at max sensitivity and moved the mouse roughly 1ft actual space and turned about 90° in game) However, there is a simple solution to these issues. For whatever reason EA forgot to and didn't patch the fact the game V-sync doesn't include the mouse (console ports huh), so you'll have to force enable it through the video card control panel. The v-sync works as expected otherwise. THE GISTAtmospheric, weight-y and  heavy combat with a great narrative universe.Follow my curation for more "

												I bought the game as a bundle with the second one. I was hoping to play through them both but unfortunately for me and apparently for many others the controls on the PC port are completely broken, there is extreme input lag unless you turn v-sync off, the mouse sensitivity is excruciating low and has negative acceleration, meaning I literally couldnt turn a corner unless i picked up my mouse and moved it across the pad several times. Even with the fixes on the forums that require you alter the files for the game, I experienced freezes in the mouse controls, and glitches with the movement. Finally I hit an invisible wall in the only path forward, meaning I had to quit the game before even the first save point. I didn't bother to try to sit through the unskippable opening cutscene again.Luckily when i went ahead to the second game I found that none of these problems persisted and I was pleasantly surprised with extremely fluid controls and movement animations. I would only buy this game if you are looking to play through the whole series, because it is likely your game will be broken and you will have to jump through hoops to actually play it. If you are just looking for a bit of the dead space experience skip this one and go for number 2.			"

You wanna walk around that corner? Make sure you're reloaded. You wanna open that door? Better aim and take a step back. Death can come from anywhere, and you're always low on health and ammo. It's not scary like typical horror games. It doesn't need jumpscares or anything like that. The incredible atmosphere of the game is enough to keep you terrified for the whole ride.

												EDIT: I bought a Xbox 360 controller and this game works perfectly with it. While this is good news it still does not change the fact that this game sucks with KB/M. Also to anyone who disagrees with me, please post a comment telling me why.This review is for the PC version only. I love this game, and have played it all the way through around four times. In my opinion, this game has one of the best horror atmospheres ever. Although its almost all jump scares, it kept me on my toes the entire game. The story was good enough to keep me entertained, and the use of audio logs was amazing. Nothing really wrong with the base game, a perfect jump-horror game. My HUGE issue with the PC port is the horrid control issues. Even on max sensitivity, it would take entire seconds to turn the camera around, and only through notepad tweaking could I make it bearable. This ""solution"" would ultimately create a form of mouse acceleration, so the movement was still not smooth. V-Sync is horribly tied into this game, which I believe is what causes this issues. Please buy this amazing game, but on a console, and tell the developers to stop putting out unacceptable PC ports.Pros:+Loads fastNegatives:-Absolutely unplayableOverall: 1/10 Do NOT buy this version, but please get it on console. This is one of my favourite horror games ever made, and it truly saddens me to give it such a low score, but this port absolutely sucked.			"

												Took me about 9 hours to complete. It is a little scary and has a couple of jump scares in it. It is a survival horror/3rd person shooter. About halfway through I became a powerhouse and was just mowing down enemies. It has some puzzles in it that were solved quickly but brought a good change of pace when needed. The zero gravity rooms were cool and also disorienting. The checkpoints were very forgiving. If you can get it for 5 bucks when it is on sale it is very worth it. 8/10			"

												Fun, scary and intense! Half the time Im so anxious looking for whats coming around the next corner. This game keeps you on your toes and weapons aimed ready because enemies come from all different directions. Different strategies/weapons for different enemies is refreshing, instead of just blasting away you have to take off their limbs. Great graphics, atmosphere and sound surrounds you and puts you smack in the middle of its eerie environment. The gameplay, weapons and upgrade system are done really well giving good replay value.

												This is an amazing game. It has borrowed some of the mechanics from Bioshock, but it is nowhere near a ""Bioshock in space"". Where bioshock has offered you a wierd and twisted sense of dementia, this game offers a cold hard fictional reality of deep space. It is gritty, dirty and bloody in right amounts. It gives you that feeling of palpable reality that you can almost taste. If you are a fan of Event Horizon, Alien etc, you will love this game.The camera is over the shoulder 3rd person, which adds to the atmosphere of something lurking just behind your back and you not being able to clearly see it. One of the greatest additions, which I want to see in all games from now on is the complete integration of GUI into the game world. There is no button that takes you out of the game, everything you do, whether browsing your inventory or checking your map is done within the world. All readings like health, air etc are integrated into your suit so you have nothing that detaches you from the world. It is amazing how an apparently simple thing as that can add to the game atmosphere.Without giving too much away the game begins with you and a crew of astronauts on course to investigate a distress beacon from a stricken spaceship, and you guessed it all hell has broken loose when you arrive. You find yourself from the very beginning isolated from your crew forced to stumble your way through the eerie and downright terrifying tunnels and rooms of the stricken ship.And the atmosphere is scary, confined and claustrophobic. Parts where you go to 0G are downright disorienting in a right way, being that you are able to walk on ceilings and walls, you can easily lose the feeling of what is up and what is down. "

												I'm not new to Dead Space. I got this game back when it came out for PS3 and it since then become one of my most loved franchises to have ever existed. Everything about this game was so perfect and back in the days, never seen in a game before. It mixed sci-fi with horror in such a way that movies like Alien and Predator could only do. Being the early 80's child that I am, this brought many smiles of joy, as well as screams of terror.I will not go much into detail, since most people who play this will be familiar with the game, wether they played it for Xbox or PS3. This game hasn't aged too well though. With so many masterpieces of the horror franchises out there, like Outlast and even the sci-fi brother Alien Isolation, Dead Space somehow does not feel too scary anymore. Not to say it's bad, but when you play Alien Isolation and then start Dead Space right after, you are not into it for the scares, but for the nostalgia.Nevertheless, Dead Space is a masterful game. So original that not many (or any) games could copy or surpass it, unless of course, we look at Dead Space 2. But I'm leaving that for another review.So moving on to the technical details:Graphics: -Playing this at 1080p on a GTX970 paired with an i5 6600k with 10% OC, running at 60fps with all settings maxed out. I can't say it looks great... It is 100x smoother than the PS3 version, yes, but that kind of hurts the game a bit since it makes the old and blurry textures stand out. The PS3 version was a lot darker, more grainy and the 30fps helped with the ""cinematic"" feel. Maybe it was my imagination. maybe back then this game looked great since there wasn't anything better.One th epossitive: Light effects are a lot sharper though, and the holographic menu looks gorgeous!Sound:-As wonderful and nerve-wrecking as I rememberControls:-Now this is where the game suffers terribly. This game on a keyboard and mouse is a no-go. Playing it with an Xbox One controller does help, but the analogs are way too sensitive compared to the absolute perfection that the Dual Shock 3 analogs were. I don't remember this game being this clunky (maybe it was), but now it is very bad. It will need some getting used to, but it will certainly won't stop me from enjoying.Story:-Very engaging, original, great character that you'll learn to love. It's like a good sci-fi B movie. It also takes some inspiration from the Alien franchise.Setting:-The sci-fi lore here is very good. I am an amature sci-fi novelist and it is absolute bliss to play this game for all those little science details. Even if some strech reality a bit, without getting too far from what it is possible.Replay value:-Not much to see here really. THis is a game you play once in a while.Port quality:-WARNING READ THIS: A lot of people complain of crashing, lag and glitchy v-sync. Be aware that this game does not play well on all systems. However there are a lot more people like me that are having absolutely NO problems with this game even maxed out. still, if you go for it and do experience problems, there are tons of threads here in the Steam community of fixes and setting combos that will certainly make the experience much more enjoyable.10/10 One of those great games that will forever be remembered in the gaming industry. Godly sequel, and even if the end of the trilogy wasn't too great (game-wise), it gave a spectacular finale to the hero that Isaac Clarke is.			"

												This game is really gawdamn scary and very atmospheric. I wouldn't play it wearing headphones if somebody paid me. Mixed emotions run rampant as you are titillated by how cool the Sci-Fi aspect is while at the same time sh!ting your pants because there are creepy♥♥♥♥♥aliens coming at you around every corner and the desire to cry and seek comfort in the fetal position. Game play for me goes like this: Ooooh cool Sci-Fi stuff - get objective - head to objective - omg what is that sound - omfg I can hear them -OMFG what was that movement out of the corner of my eye -  Aaah AAAH AAAH AAAHF#CKB@STARD Aaahah - frantic shooting - frantic camera panning -  Aaah AAAH AAAH AAAHF#CKB@STARD Aaahah - frantic shooting - frantic camera panning -  Map - Run like you stole something to the closest save point - Save - Exit and watch baby animal videos on YouTube to recover - play again tomorrow because that adrenalin rush is damn addictive and the game is really cool.The sadistic voice in my head wants to get this for all the people I 'love' <3			"

Dead Space is the best Horror Game I played 9 years ago!Its strange the game is 9 years Old and still kicking! Pros and Cons  Liked Hated   Best Space Concept and Planetary View. The Game is Scripted, which means that the people you like in the game dies anyway and there is no way or choice to save them.   Alot of Jumpscares and you Probably think twice before going into an unknown location. The Game becomes more easy after Completing the first round.   Psychic Horror. Nicole was Dead all along.  The Game is very likely to be considered similar to Capcom's Resident Evil 4 Slow Controls Senstivity and Low FPS, you have to manually Disable V-sync to get 60+ Frames.  You will get 60+ Frames. There is No way to Lock the Frames at 60 FPS. "

												Dead Space is a fun horror survival game I have owned numours times and enjoyed replaying. I first bought this game on the PS3 and put almost 2 days worth into playing it both for achievements and the experience. Dead Space's atmosphere is great and does a beautiful job of creating a spooky sci-fi horror on top of third person survival shooting. The game's story starts off as players playing as an engineer named Isac Clark who knows how to fix  EVERYTHING  and his team who were sent to fix a planet cracker ship called the Ishimurra. Clark's wife named Nicole was working on the Ishimurra untill something went wrong with their dig site and sent out a distress call for help. As Clark's team enters the Ishimurra they uncover the horrorfying necromorphs in the ship and try to desperatly escape. This game offers hours of fun from straight replayability to the experimenting with gear and tactics used to help you survive. The equipment in Dead Space is upgradable consisting of your suit (RIG), Stasis, Kenisis Module, and a total of 6 guns to use; 5 of them purchasable in game. These upgrades require nodes found in game or purchased at the store to upgrade their arsenal. In order to kill these necromorphs players are forced to shoot/cut thier limbs off instead of just shooting their head or torso bringing a new formula to survival shooting. Shooting thier legs off will only make them crawl towards players and shooting their heads off will make them swing wildly and aimlessly. The horror in this game is good and provides good jump scares even to people who replay the game. There are small mini games in Dead Space both rewarding prizes that aid the player in upgrading equipment or selling to the store. Dead Space is a great horror survival shooter with replayability both for higher difficulty and new game + to experiment with new weapons or simply play again with current equipment. I would not recommend purchasing this game on its own purchasing the Dead Space 1 & 2 bundle is a better price and more bang for your buck as the sequel is equally if not better than the original Dead Space.

												Dead Space is probably one of the best scifi action-horror games I've played. It has amazing atmosphere, visuals that still hold up, art design and interface design that blends awesomely and some of the best sound design ever. Firstly, if you get this game turn the music off. Yes, off. It has musical ques that while cool, give away there are enemies around/alive. If there's still some kind of music playing, you have a monster about. It ruins the atmosphere as great as the music is. You get a number of weapons that have alternate firing modes that make the game pretty damn replayable. All function differently and offer different pluses and minuses. Some people write this off as jumpscare the game, I say ...well yeah kinda. But that's fine since the tension matches the jumpscare. Stand idle in any area and listen. The sounds you hear, the creaking of the ship, the buzzing of electronics and the rustling of monsters really sets the mood. This game is the scifi-version of Resident Evil. You're trapped in a large place and have to deal with the hell onboard while dealing with limited supplies. You'll be running all over the ship doing tasks but things change as you go along, it's never dull. They keep things interesting. The interface is as I said, brilliant. There's no hud. All of Issac's gauges are on the back of his suit, or project from them, including the menus. It's really really well thought out and it keeps you focused on what's important, the center of the screen. Now on to the problems. This is a old PC game indeed, right when PC games were getting back on track with decent ports. This game is pretty good but I'm going to say some things that may break this game for you. Unless you change the game to have vsync every time you enter it, the game will lock at 30 if booted with vsync on. If you put vsync on after the game is on it'll lock to 60. However blasphemous as it sounds, you may prefer 30FPS since if you leave the framerate unlocked the mouse controls even at wildly high sensitivity levels are too slow to use. Also, the physics go haywire at above 30, killed enemies will bounce up and zero G bodies will start spinning like tornadoes. The crap mouse controls can be countered by using ....I'm gonna say it, a controller. Works perfectly with a XB360 or XB1 controller straight away. Which may not be ideal but it works. There could be a mod to fix this as well, I'm not sure. But I've played it with a controller and it's nice. Then again I've used controllers a bunch back in the PS2 days so I'm familiar with them. The last thing I noticed is if you jump in zero G at too narrow an angle, the game can bug out. <-this is avoidable. Even with these problems I still recommend it. You may have to use a controller or use a mouse at 30fps but it's still a fun game. I kinda link it with you're not supposed to be a badass shot, you're supposed to unused to shooting people/creatures. The sequel fared much better in terms of porting and is also a great game.			"

												Dead Space to me is like Super Mario 64 to my Nintendo machine.  I don't know how and why the Dead Space series has slipped over the years, but Dead Space 1 was always the best Dead Space and a genre defining game.  In fact, no one has really created a game where there are space zombies, you fight these things in space, combined with scare and horror with the dread of being alone.  You are truly alone in space.  Dead Space 2 was great too but no where as near as great as Dead Space.  It's one of those games that left an imprint in my recollection of gaming experiences along with Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Super Mario 64, Street Fighter, Goldeneye 64, Lost Odyssey, Valkyria Chronicles, Halo series, and a few others.  The Dead Space Universe is where the heart is.  There's vast potential.  The world of Dead Space is intriguing, and when well written, developed, and executed, it's the definitive space zombie game with a major twist.  But to call it space zombie is a hit from the hilt.  It's a lot more than that.  They're called necromorphs, and they're terrifying.  Horrific.  They terrorize your soul.The premise of Dead Space is overwhelming with potential possibilities that could bring the series back to life.  Dead Space 4, if it happens, will hopefully revisit the memories of the first game.  It's a must-play, sit in a dark room, with your headphones on video game.  Immerse yourself fully into its atmosphere and it will be one of the best times you've spent playing a game.Rating: 9.2 out of 10			"

												I like Alien Isolation but I have no respect for the main director Alistair Hope, this guy obviously knows sh*t about it and his team probably did all his work on his place. He said that ''horror and the survival genre"" were banalized by games like Dead Space (he meant the series) and the violence and action suffered with it. Well, tell me about banalization 21st Century Fox... Colonial Marines was your idea. I wish I could have said that publicly but better late than never, you and your publishers were just full of sh*t.Most games you play were later created after the engine firstly made to build it, ultimately leaving it with some limitations followed by many cuts of contents. ‎Wright Bagwell and Dead Space's main writters ‎Warren Ellis, Rick and Antony were the only guys at the time to have enough balls to go for the opposite direction creating the plot first then the engine later, based on the idea blowing the genre and changing industry's rules. Maybe that's why the scary jumpy moments still works to this date and why it feels so mature during every scene and event. Voice acting was/is absurdly good and it was probably the first game to take motion capture so seriously. Screams from the Necromorph are ridiculously well done. ""There is no scape"" feeling precedes that. Even if I dislike Dead Space 3 so much, the studio works can still be seen there. No, it shouldn't have been a first person, period. Ask about RE4 Shoulder Camera.It's incredible how those sci-fi machinery can look and feel dead serious to mess with. This constant feeling of ''I'm screw*d"" persists with everything you do and walk on. Game came out by 2008 so expect some clunky mechanics and outdated graphics, old ideas like non-voiced main character (later improved and evolved) but those were features made to last and it sure does its job which I'm still impressed. If you think I'm exaggerating, only after a time I came to know about a mind blowing secret from the game. By now you may already know about the bathroom thing, but I will blur it all here because it wasn't just there... It's actually scattered all around USG Ishimura.During the entire game some brillant form of subliminal voice and textures were running on the background and later on I came to know about the creepy whispers. They were so low you couldn't really hear or make sense out of it.  Now... this explain why the game was always scary even when nothing was happening. ID Software was reluctant to use those techniques on Doom 3, they were affraid about some Disney-like accusations but Eastwood Studios didn't gave a sh*t. The symbols on walls aren't just symbols, they're an actual hidden language. The fictious group Unithology is clearly messing with the real world Scienthology religion bullsh*t. When you find this out you start to realize the game isn't about biological weapons and that the enemy might be more darker in nature and origin. Answers should come after DS3 but the Dead Moon looked hellish, but not really from ... hell?  Since Dead Space 3 got the plot so f*ck*d up, we may never known anymore. The series are now indefinitely cancelled. EA broke further partneship with Valve so don't expect it here neither.There is no way to not recommend it good old times of horror that still lives here to be experienced for a ridiculous low price.EA is in the game? Nope.Just push the discharge button and make it flow within the sewer system. Every game EA puts her greedy hands on, they manage destroy it somehow. Friend, you don't need Dead Space 3. It's just some cool action game that failed to deliver the basics of survival... unless you like some loose gunner game rap*ng your fan love, forget it. Maybe mister Alister is right after all? DS3 is mainly a co-op game but If you're playing alone you will laugh at the character teleport on animation sequences. I won't ever recommend you DS3, it is simply a f*ck*ng joke with a very nice design. "

There needs to be just enough of a blend tension, fear and scare tactics so the game does not fall to mundane generic enemies jumping out at players. Dead Space not only creates the one of the best atmospheres in a horror video game, it’s full of enough puzzles, frights and dilemmas to make even the most jaded 3rd Person Shooter player sit up and take notice. You play as Isaac Clarke, a space engineer, traveling to the USG Ishimura, a “Planet Cracker” which is emitting a distress call. After a tense opening sequence, Isaac boards the ship with his coworkers, Lt. Zach Hammond, security officer, and Kendra Daniels, a computer expert, and soon realizes this is no ordinary distress call as the ship has been overrun by an alien race. Isaac gets separated from his coworkers and must fight his way through the alien monsters to bring the ship back online and find a way off the Ishimura. Gameplay: Dead Space has taken every great piece of third person gameplay in the history of video games and combines it together to deliver an entertaining, enjoyable journey. You navigate Isaac from an over-the-shoulder view. There is no Heads Up Display (HUD) in Dead Space. Your health is indicated by the light meter embedded in the spine of your suit spine. Your ammo is displayed above your weapon when you aim and your stasis meter is also located on the back of your suit. What is stasis? It is a piece of technology that gives you the ability to slow down objects and enemies for puzzle solving and reaction time. You can recharge your stasis by accessing stations located throughout the ship or by finding portable stasis packs. Isaac also has the ability to use Kinesis, which allows him to move heavy objects or acquire objects that are out of reach. Stasis becomes available to Isaac a few minutes into the game, and Kinesis becomes available for use when entering the second chapter and has unlimited use.The game's most unique and striking appeal is operating in zero gravity or a vacuum. When entering a Zero-G zone, Isaac has the ability to jump from one side of the area to another. This opens up an new realm of puzzle solving and is some of the most fun sequences in the game. The enemies in Dead Space are deformed humans that were killed and turned into monsters by a race of alien creatures. There are a dozen or so different styles of enemies that navigate their way through the ships ventilation system, which means you may encounter an enemy at any given time. As many enemies as there are, they all can be taken out with the same technique: begin by shooting off their limbs first. Direct hits to the body will waste ammo, especially during fights with the tougher, more advanced enemies. Some of the more memorable enemies are the epic boss fights that also combine a little Zero-G action. The threats on the ship are sometimes not always enemy related. Dead Space shifts gears twice for a little Han Solo, “Don’t Get Cocky” turret action. So how do you take out all the enemies? With a wide range of weaponry of course. Isaac begins the game with a Cutter, an extremely accurate “laser” that fires a wide beam either horizontally or vertically. There are tons of lockers and chests to explore during the course of the game. Some lockers may contain ammo and others may contain credits, which can be used in Stores. At these Store locations, Isaac can store, ammo and items. Isaac is limited in the number of items he can carry, however the number of items can be increased if he upgrades his suit. Usually near by a store, is a Workbench, where Isaac can upgrade his weapons and gear.There is a lot of backtracking in Dead Space. At the beginning of each chapter, Issac exits a tram which carries passengers from one section of the ship to another, and at the end of each chapter he makes his way back to the same tram to journey to the next section of the ship. Isaac visits some sections of the ship more than once. There are tons of save points throughout Dead Space, probably more than there should be. Even if you don not save, Dead Space autosaves so much that you really do not have to save once through the entire game, unless you want to exit out of Dead Space or turn off your PS3. To make the game even easier, the developers also added in a feature that actually maps out the direction Isaac needs to travel to complete his next objective. This feature is displayed by a blue outline on the ground. (see pic below)The problem that most avid gamers will notice is that everything, aside from the zero gravity gameplay, has been borrowed from past films, novels, or other games. The over the shoulder view bares a striking resemblance to Resident Evil 4, the monsters are mere replicas of John Carpenter's The Thing, parallels in Event Horizon are seen throughout the entire game including some obvious set design rip offs and features in Doom 3 and System Shock are also used in Dead Space. It is at this point where we stop and think: are these references by the EA Readwood Game designers an homage to their favs or are they simply thefts? No matter, the similarities are not enough to take away from the Dead Space experience which delivers a terrifying story, but the influences are definitely obvious. Graphics and Sound:Dead Space does everything right graphically. It looks beautiful in full 1080p when staring out into the vast ocean of space, blowing an enemies head off, or playing through some beautiful level designs of what a 'Planet Cracker's' engine room, maintenance bay and mining section may look like. The sound effects are also top notch in Dead Space. As Isaac communicates with his team, a 2D holograph image appears before Isaac, which the player can rotate. The static overlaid onto the video and audio logs is incorporated nicely, and the creeks and cracks heard throughout the broken ship add much to the atmosphere. Listen for the lullaby. Players may pick up quickly on how Visceral tries to scare its players. They use the same formula that Hollywood does, during a tense or critical moment in the game they play loud music like the typical brass pieces you hear in most horror movies. More often than not this takes place when a player looks in the direction of an enemy. So this tactic may help a player in certain areas rather than scare him or her. If a player is not paying attention and some random horns start playing, that is a pretty good indication that there was probably a monster that ran past the door that they probably missed. Pros: controls work extremely well on the PS3, terrifying boss battles, graphics and sound are gripping, Cons: : unoriginal enemies, predictable but engaging story, very easy to beat, lots of backtracking Bottom Line: I recommend this game in spite of my criticism of the unoriginality of some of its elements but it is defendable to question why this game has been so highly touted. Some have labeled Dead Space as the ‘Worlds Scariest Game’ and people are shouting from roof tops to “Buy this game immediately!”. The game isn’t perfect, but what is? It has a wonderfully smooth flowing story, a great environment, near perfect controls and graphics that can make a grown man cry. Dead Space is solid game that should be experienced by as many players as possible. There are striking resemblances to a dozen pieces of work, but they are forgivable. Expect a sequel.			"

												Do you like space?  Do you like zombies?  Do you like fighting through wave after wave of faceless, terrifying enemies?  If so, this game is a must!Story:  9/10  As Isaac Clark, you get plunged into a desperate struggle for survival as you try to find a way off of the USG Ishimura, a deep-space mining ship that becomes infected with an alien parasite that turns corpses into vicious, mindless zombie things called Necromorphs.  You must fight your way through the ship, repairing key systems and unravelling the mysteries of the ship's mission.  The tory does a great job of keeping the tone of the game consistent throughout.  The whole time, you are seemingly one step behind, as you desperatley try to repair life support systems, engines, etc.  The problem I have with the story is the plot twist at the end, which I won't spoil.  Gameplay:  9/10  This game has one of the most creative combat systems I've come across in my many years of gaming.  It is, at its core, a third-person shooter, but not like the Mass Effect series where you run around guns ablaze.  To kill the necromorph enemies, you have to dismember them with your improvised weapons made from engineering tools.  You have to use your environment to your advantage.  The weapon upgrade system is very simple, yet rewarding.  As the game progresses, the enemies become more challenging to defeat, and require different strategies and weapons to beat.  Also, this game does a great job, in my opinion, of making boss battles.  They are simple and not too challenging (at least at easy difficulties), but I can't think of many modern games with actual boss battles.  Pretty much every level ends with one.  You also have at your disposal a stasis tool that sets anything it hits, wether it's an enemy or malfuntioning door, into slow-motion.  You also have a kinesis tool that allows you to grab things from afar and throw them.  You will have to use these things in conjunction to solve puzzles.Setting:  9/10  The USG Ishimura gets a little boring after a few levels, as everything kind of looks the same.  That being said, I'm a sucker for scientifically accurate space games.  Upon entering the vaccuum of space, you loose sound for the most part.  There are many places of zero-gravity, where you get to float around in dissorienting fashion.  The ship is creepy and almost archaic-looking, which fits the tone of the game very well.  The game has a few moments of horror, especially at the begining.  You pick up voice and text logs throughout the game, which add depth to the story.  Overall, I really enjoy this game.  It also has some nice replay value as it allows you to keep all of your weapons, with their upgrades, and your suit when you start a new game.  The story is also pretty fun the second time around because of the several plot twists you know about from the first play through.  The best thing about this game is the atmosphere it creates when you play it.  If you aren't playing with all of the lights turned off with sound-cancelling headphones, you aren't playing it right!

												It's like you were dropped off in a horror movie. The fear will consume you. Your heart will pound after being jumped on when you least expect it. That fear will make you into a heartless machine that will anticipate any attack from any corner. You see that dark corner over there? Definitely going to be jumped there, you think to yourself. You think to yourself that you are the master of horror and know what will happen. You play several scenarios in your head of different actions to take when you get to that corner as you walk over with your gun drawn, anticipating a jump. Nothing. Paranoia is a sign of insansity, my friend. You will not escape this world as the same person you were when you entered.			"

												I encountered the Tentacle Hentai monster after it came out of a dark corner and I♥♥♥♥♥♥myself. It grabbed my leg and dragged me down a bloody hallway with corpses that had been ripped open. That was the point where I shot it so many times that Jacket from Hotline Miami would go ""Damn!""After I shot it off I then got an explosive weapon and fired all of my ammo for it into the vent that it came from. I then got all of my other guns and used all of the ammo for them as well. I then had to walk down a dark hallway with no ammo as the most paranoid person in all of existence. Then I got stabbed by a necromorph. Then I realised I didn't save; the true horror of Dead Space.Possibly the best horror game I've ever played.			"

												A terrifyingly good TPS game. Dead Space - I believe - reinvented the genre and showed that there were originals games at the time. I liked both its sequels - yeah, the 3rd part has more action, so what? The story continues, so this was needed so those of you who prefer the scary parts can easily play the first game again.Pros:--- hologram-like ingame menu: your inventory, the map, and even your objectives are projected in front of you--- the concept of dismemberment: forget everything you learned from FPS games - headshots this time will not work, at all--- amazing graphics and equally high-quality audio: my favourites are the zero-g scenes where you hear your breathing more than the surrounding sound--- high replayability due to the unlockable items, difficulty modesCons:--- not much to say here, really, perhaps that the game can be difficult at times, but not because it truly is challenging but because fighting in close-quarters can only be difficult (you cannot really come up with any proper tactics)The sequels only improve upon the experience by expanding upon the story and giving the protagonist a face and voice.

												This is hands down one of my all time favorite games. I played all of these games in a mixed order, so this one, the first one, is the last one that I beat. The story was incredibly captivating and kept me on edge. The game play is based on focus and using everything you can to your advantage. Jump scares and intense alien combat are great. Highly reccomended. Personally, my favorite of the series.			"

Posted: November 14, 2014
												I find it easier to write reviews in a Pro and Con list style, as I find it's a more effective way to get my meaning across, so please bare with me if it's not to your tastes. The Pro's -Good graphics, even with things like AA and other advanced settings off.-Great atmosphere, especially with the music score at its full intensity and also by letting your imagination wander while playing.  -As I just touched upon, the sound design is fantastic, constant bangs, clunks, moans, and rattles give the effect that you are indeed aboard a decaying ship, with monsters moving throughout it. Fleshy bits make an appropriate ""squish"" when shot, and guns have an appropriate ""oomph"" to them. -Good variety of enemies, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. For example, Slashers are fast, but have exposed legs, Pregnomorphs are slow, but hard to take down without spilling their ""cargo"" all over the floor, etc. Other types of enemies have other weaknesses. -The A.I. is pretty good. Enemies will charge you if you turn your back, pop out of vents that are close to you, swarm you all at once rather than one at a time, etc. -The story is good, but it does have its issues, as I will state in the Con's section. -Voice acting is good, none of the actor's sound like they ""phoned it in."" While the main protagonist Isaac Clarke doesn't talk, he does make grunts, yells, and appropriately heavy breathing noises when necessary. -Environmental design is great, cargo rooms and mechanical stations are open, crew rooms are more enclosed, with tighter corridors, etc. Rooms are in places that make sense (i.e, no engine room on the opposite end of the ship from where the engines are.) -They story is pretty decently lengthed, I've beaten this game several times (mainly on console) and it still takes me around 8 hours or so. I'd imagine it would probably take a newer player around 10-12 hours to beat.-Character design is good, no one is stereotypical, and each character is decently memorable. -I enjoyed the audio and video log collecting, which helped expand on the backstory and helps determine just what happened aboard the  Ishimura  (the name of the ship you board.)-There's a good variety of weapons, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. There's also different suit levels you can get, which work well and look cool at the same time. -You can upgrade your weapons, armor, Statis unit (slows down enemies and objects), and kinesis unit (pick up objects from a distance) using ""Power Nodes"" you find throughout this ship or bought through the Store aboard the ship. -Each weapon also has an ""alt fire"" mode to it. The plasma cutter changes from horizontal to vertical shooting (more useful than you might think) the Pulse Rifle fires in a circle, etc. -Anti-gravity areas are cool, but could have been done better. (They are done better in Dead Space 2 and 3.)-There's more positive aspects, but that covers most of the main bits.-The game also likes to mess with you in small ways, areas that were safe most of the game may not be safe anymore, some enemies come out of unexpected areas, the game tenses you up for a scare that doesn't happen (but it's done well, and on purpose.)  The Con's -Aiming is a bit iffy with a mouse and keyboard, turning of V-Sync helps, which you have to do both in the in-game settings and in the .cfg files for it to actually work. However, I'd recommend playing with a controller if possible, if not, you can still play the game quite well with a M/KB. -While I stated earlier that the story was pretty good, it's not without flaws. For the most part you are the secondary protagonists *itch for most of the game, doing something or other for them, sometimes when it's something they could do themselves. Not to say they sit on their butts all game, but still. -This game also follows the horror game trope of magically seperating you from you allies when a situation arises. Granted, it doesn't do it as often as other games and sometimes you even meet up with them. (Who'da thunk it?)-As I said, this game has a cool variety of weapons, but for a more skilled player, they are unnecessary. I can make it through this game with just the Plasma Cutter and the Pulse Rifle as my weapons, not even touching the others. On console, I've even done an entire run through of the game with  only  the Plasma Cutter. -The A.I. is good, but it does have its..... moments. I've seen Necromorphs pop out of vents, only to hop right back in and pop out somewhere farther away from me. I've also seen the A.I. not want to walk through doorways that lead out of the area, but are willing to hop in a vent and pop out of a vent that  is  in that new area, for reasons I assume that involve the games pathfinding. -The game also can get repetitive after a while, not that it's not fun, but some Necromorph encounters do get predictable (mainly entering a new area and Necromorphs almost immediately showing up.) -The game has puzzles (not that I mind), but almost all of them are pretty basic and easy (at least to me) and don't offer much challenge. -Controls are tanky (much like Resident Evil 4), which is fine, but in some areas of the game (mainly anti-grav and space areas) these controls can get semi-annoying and cumbersome. -The game just isn't that scary for me, it's pretty decently thrilling the first time you play it, and its got its tense moments, but I was never crapping my pants in horror or dreading to go in the next room. I am also hard to scare however, while some people are quite the opposite.  Nitpicks and Personal Annoyances  -The amount of settings are decent, but nothing to write home about, and I was disappointed by some options that were missing. -The game isn't very optimized, I can play Dead Space 2 with higher settings than this one and run higher frames, yet I play this game with the same settings and get noticeably lower frames per second. -Another reason to turn V-Sync off (as if there weren't enough already) is that it causes a noticeably annoying ""dragging"" feel to your mouse, this is especially present in the Main Menu and the Pause Menu. -This isn't an annoyance, but playing this game with headphones is a good idea, it helps you find enemies easier, helps you get more enthralled in the atmosphere, and just makes it an overall better experience. If I had to give this game a number review it would probably be a 9/10. (It'd be higher without the wonky V-Sync and mild control problems.) And finally: TL:DR -MUST PLAY, BUT 2 SPOOKY 4 ME.  "

Dead Space is a good ride through a pretty scary ship. Packed with jump scares. The monsters are straight out of the 80's movie “The Thing”, with almost an Event Horizon style of design to the ship. There is a nice leveling up system, and there are some interesting weapons. There is even some Zero G action, which was a nice touch. The game does have a frustrating part at the end of chapter 4, but before you rage quit put down your 360 controller and grab your gaming mouse (solves the problem trust me). Dead Space is definitely one to buy on steam sale if you haven’t played it. The game being older runs well on a most systems (not your grandmas Windows 95, but anything from 2012 and up should be fine). The only thing that could have made this better would be some co-op, but it may have killed some of the atmosphere. Turn off the lights, crank up the volume, and get ready. Here it comes!OLDER GAMER APPROVEDPOTATO PC CERTIFIED Visit our Currator Page "

												Nearly 10 years old, but its still holds up today. The story is interesting, and while it has some iffy moments, overall its helps to create a pretty interesting world. Good art design and optimisation means that it runs well and still looks really good a game from 2008. The Necromorph design is one of nightmare. The gameplay is is great mix of action, but also♥♥♥♥♥♥yourself survival, you never really feel overpowered, and you may be genuinely scared when you hear some enemies.			"

												8/10 Action/horror game.Very good atmosphere, it really ♥♥♥♥s with you if you play it at night with the volume cranked up. The ambient sounds are the creepiest thing in the game. Gameplay wise it's really fun shooting limbs and jumping around in 0 gravity. It doesn't qualify as a survival horror game simply because you are VERY powerful and can wreck every single scrub coming at you. But it's not really an issue, because it's fun doing that.Recommended/10 .			"

												Well, first of all, let's say, that entering Dead Space universe is kinda risky, because it can hold you for a looooong time.Dead Space is a some kind of masterpiece for me. I played it alot on pirated version, when i didn't even have a Steam, so don't pay too much attention about play time, just replayed it one more time on the hardest difficulty.So, what is this game?- First of all. NECROMORPHS! Yus, they are the key feature of this game, you will love them alot. They are very, very interesting, funny, lovely, and cute. But to be honest, ugly as hell, and sometimes Ishimura reminds hell really nice.- Atmosphere. It has amazing sounds, scenes, and environment. Just don't forget to listen to sounds a little more, and you will feel yourself uncomfortable.- Effort, length. Dayum, this game is longer, than 50% of our time's horrors. And very, very well made. Reading and listening to every note is making a wonderful feeling of very deep atmosphere.- Great OST. I don't have any words for it. Had a feeling, that actually it's not a music, but real sounds.Why i didn't say anything negative about game?Because... Urgh, don't even know. I don't think, that this game has something to let people ragequit, except jumpscares.Well. I'm giving to it 10\10, beause it's playable unreally good in our time too.  Graphics are good enough. xD			"

												I found it unplayable on PC. Mouse aiming AND controller aiming are both worthless. Disabling vsync will only fix the lag and 10fps menus and 30 fps gameplay, which then leaves you with massive obvious tearing because half this game uses strobe lights. Then if you try to force vsync in AMD Panel or D3DOverrider, nothing works. RadeonPro did force vsync but it only ended up making the controls feel even worse. It will not fix the massive deadzone in your aiming. There's no analog to the aiming, or very little. You either dont move, or you turn full speed. Maybe I'm just picky but this is ridiculous. Just get the sequel. It has a nice summary of the first game for you and improved lots of aspects of the game.			"

												Albeit not scary, it's a decent and atmospheric horror-like action game. The story and characters might be average at best, and controls are a bit annoying (just as the camera), but the interesting setting and audiovisuals absorbs the player into an atmosphere of desolation and terror. If you like horrors, then you should enjoy Dead Space a lot.			"

												Starts off incredibly scary and slowly becomes more and more of an action game. Amazing atmosphere (particularly background noise, lighting, and dust/particle effects).

												I'll be honest and admit that I failed to get into this one on the PS3 some years back, mostly on account of the controls being too unweildy.  But on PC and a keyboard this game frigging ROCKS (no, not just rocks: whopping great spinning METEORS, damn you all)!     Like any great horror game, the sound design is the single most effective element, and keeps you on your toes constantly...at least until the last quarter or so of the game, by which time things do become a mite predictable. But apart from being a tad overlong for its own good, this is pretty well a must-play for anyone who loves the Silent Hill and/or Resident Evil franchises, or similar third person horror games. It's by and largely a remake of Resident Evil 4 set in space, but fresh enough for all that.     Story and setting-wise, its influences are more noticeably cinematic, namely 2001: A Space Odyssey meets Alien, by way of John Carpenter's The Thing. All exceptionally good company, in other words!  Spooky, fun, stupidly violent...all the things any sane person demands in a video game. Looking forward to the next two!!!Verdict: 9.5/10.			"

												When it was released in 2007 I remember Dead Space being one of the best horror games I had played since the Silent Hill 2/Fatal Frame CB-era. Going back how does it hold up today? A bit on the good, a bit on the bad it seems.First off know that if you like horror games and have never picked up the series then there’s really no reason not to play the game. Despite some of its shortcomings it’s still a deeply immersive experience. Though I think the series as a whole gets lauded as “thah scuriest games evurh!” far too often (as you’ll eventually become used to its brand of trying to scare you and begin predicting where the next enemy is coming from) that doesn’t change the fact that the environments are excellently crafted, deeply foreboding, and the gameplay is fun if not perfect. In fact while I believe the later games certainly improved on the mechanics, and I eventually grew to like Isaacs voice (he’s silent in this one), I think overall this game creates a far better atmosphere. You rarely if ever feel safe, the graphics while aged still look nice, and unlike the later entries unless you’re playing on the easiest difficulty or two (or are a horror god) you’ll be rationing supplies to an extent. Additionally while some dislike it I quite liked the fact that except for a few rare occasions almost all communication with others is done via radio, true it isn’t as cinematic as later entries, but it gives the distinct impression that only you can save yourself and no help is coming. It’s true that thanks to an upgrade system most people do feel rather powerful by the end, but you have to work toward that and in the early to middle game it’s true survival horror.As for the bad, well as I said later games improved on the mechanics and that’s because some of the mechanics are broken. The big mechanic of “shoot the limbs” is completely missed by the inclusion of weapons that can do just as much damage shooting for the core (it can be fun to play through with only the base weapon and it is perfectly effective, but isn’t required and if you’re just breezing through can totally be skipped). The Zero-G sections are awe inspiringly painful to play, you’ll get the hang of it but because you have no control and can only jump from point-to-point it isn’t fun. And the physics are all over the place as well as the hit-boxes at times, especially where stomping or some of the more concentrated weapons are concerned.There’s also a small factor that never really bothered me but I see brought up all the time so it’s worth mentioning. This game truly is “fetch quest, the FPS”. Though the underlying plotline, the history, and the environment of the ship itself are all very interesting the actual activities you’re asked to complete aren’t. EVERYTHING is broken and because the other survivors are a bunch of sissy pants you literally get to fix a starship as a one-man engineering crew. The fact that the other elements are so strong glossed over this for me, but lots of people note it and I can’t deny its truth.In short the game is still a classic. Some of it hasn’t aged as well as other parts but like great horror games from the very start of gaming chances are you’ll easily forgive those things in light of the overwhelming positives.			"

												Just finished Dead Space on Medium (Normal) difficulty. So far the title has been an absolute thrill, with tension and terror at every turn, some physical and some psychological. The backstory of the game is very deep, with you being able to control the character Isaac in an attempt to escape a ship  filled with the undead alive, preferably with his allies and his wife, who is lost onboard. The background is explored through lost recordings, some video, audio, and text, as well as the environment itself.The title itself is very unsettling, as even bumping into a beer can will startle you. Undead can appear behind you, in front of you, above you, all around you. It was fairly challenging on medium, with an option for Easy, Hard, and an unlockable Impossible mode, which I haven't tried out yet. Items can be found through schematics, bought in the store, and then upgraded through the use of nodes (items which you insert into others to make them better). The story is long, around 8-10 hours if you spend time collecting everything. The replayability factor is large enough for maybe 1 or 2 extra playthroughs, which can be spent using your fully upgraded arsenal, or upgrading it to that, and collecting logs you may have missed.The downsides to this title are mentionable, although they don't detract from the experience very much. No steam achievements, cards, or DLC for this title. I cling to hope that EA may port their dlc to the pc, preferably in a package, although its small. I encountered a glitch, which I read is very common for pc gamers. That glitch is called the ""Continue glitch"", where if you start the game on any difficulty other than medium, save, exit, then click continue instead of load game, it will change your save to medium difficulty with no way to go back. I started on Easy the first play through, and it happened to me on chapter 2. This can be avoided though, although it hasn't been patched out yet. The aim is also sort of slow, but I can't tell if its a bug or if its part of the games' unique aiming itself.All in all I rate this game a 9/10. Its a great game to start off a series but it is hindered by an almost unavoidable bug, no steam extras, and no pc DLC, although the other two versions of this game recieved it. Get it on discount and you won't regret it.http://www.isthereanydeal.com "

												Fun as hell, and possibly the best in the series.  An excellent third person shooter - although not particularly scary.  It's very immersive, and you grow to care about the characters.  There is just enough mystery in the game to keep you interested in the storyline.  The fact that there are distinctive ""chapters"" you complete helps you feel a sense of accomplishment while playing - beyond the fact that you’re kicking some freak-monster-zombie♥♥♥♥♥Ammo is somewhat scarce, which allows for a sense of urgency in the game.  The chapters are varied, and present you with all sorts of different obstacles to overcome.  The upgrade system is simple, but certainly effective.   0n normal, monsters are a little tough, but not much of a challenge.  If you're looking for something more difficult, definitely play on hard.  The only criticism I have is that with my particular graphics card - GTX 770 - some of the character models glitch out and flop all over the place. PERSONALLY I find this hysterical, and am actually happy when it happens, but I could see how for a lot of people this could be frustrating.  Ironically running fraps fixes the issue somehow.  The only part that it really affected me is during a section where a boss fight was supposed to be, the boss never spawned - I just fixed it with fraps for that part of the game and all was good.Do NOT use a mouse with this game, however, because it was poorly ported and there are problems with the mouse sensitivity/acceleration/all sorts of other things, which is known issue.  Controller is certainly best in this situation.   "

												To date, I have played through this game on PC twice and am considering going through it again because of how much I love the world/story/universe.  This game is a great survival horror experience with a bit of a ""Wait, what!?"" towards the end, but that doesn't really take away from the game as a whole.I have read/heard some people complain about having graphical issues with the game on Steam, but I have not had any issues that made me question the quality (both on Windows 7 and on Windows 10).  Each time, I have played M/KB and again, everything felt fine; I cannot comment on how the game felt/played with a 360 or Steam Controller.			"

												Dead Space is a fantastic Horror game that combines third person shooting in a good way. It has many more things to offer then just some predictable jump-scares. It has a lot of atmosphere and a decent story. The controls remind me a lot of Resident Evil 4, in a good way. Upgrading your weapons and suit is as addivtive as ever. Very tense game that's worth your money!			"

												Dead Space remains my all time favourite game. Replayed it over and over on X-Box, love it so much I got it on PC too. In this game you play as an engineer called Issac Clark and is set far far into the future out in Space. It definately does not lack a horror element and has a very very very good storyline. Play this game with headphones and you will appreciate Viscerals attention to sound details. Metal clashing, electricity buzzing, necromorphs (The monsters) moving around in vents, Issac's breathing, screams - all out horror noises. The graphics are good. Most of the game is quite dim to create the horror element. LIghts and sparks of electricity add to an array of lighting effects.You have a great choice of weapons which can be upgraded in-game by collecting powernodes. I love how you have in-game currency and literally do not have to spend real life money at all.PLAY IT before Dead Sppace 2 & 3 - otherwise the story won't make much sense, plus it's by far the best in the trilology.Dead Space - ruining my life since 2008			"

												First of all the mouse sensitivity was all over the place. The camera wouldn't move and when it did it would move really slowly, making the game pretty much unplayable. I found a fix for that which still didn't work very well so I decided to play with a 360 controller. That worked fine but then I got to a door which I couldn't walk through because there was an invisible wall in the way. Apparently the first enemy in the game is supposed to come through it and start attacking you but that never happened. It seems a few other people have had this problem because I was able to find a fix which requires you to record with FRAPS while playing which will make the enemy appear and the invisible wall to disappear allowing you to progress.I don't know why I should bother playing any longer if I've already had this many problems in the first 5 minutes of the game. Luckily I got it on sale and only wasted a couple of dollars.			"

												Dead Space is essentially a 3rd-person-shooter set in a haunted house in space. As Isaac Clarke you spend the vast majority of the game on the USG Ishimura, a mining ship with technical difficulties. However, you soon find out that technical defects are the least of your worries on this ship, as the reanimated remains of the crew chase you down while you're doing your best trying to get out of this predicament alive. Interestingly, Isaac is not military personnel, but rather an engineer, so instead of shredding aliens with assault rifles and shotguns you slice them to pieces with your power tools. During combat you'll mostly be dismembering different types of the so-called Necromorph to incapacitate and ultimately kill them, and even though Isaac moves rather slowly and heavily the fights are very gratifying, not least because of ample (and very gory) visual feedback. Dead Space liberally uses and mixes elements from other established horror and sci-fi franchises and manages to concoct something that's interesting and fun to play. Everything, from the clean visuals to the simple but good enough story is tight and to the point, and there are rarely sections where you feel like you're just wasting your time. Even though the story backdrop is rather thin and won't win many prizes, it works well, gives you clear goals and enough context to know what you're doing. The atmosphere is tense throughout and some of the imagery is rather creative and maybe even a bit disturbing.In summary: I can very easily recommend Dead Space if you're looking for a solid horror game set in a sci-fi universe. It's an interesting spin on many ideas and tropes you'll have seen somewhere else already and never outstays its welcome.			"

PROS:+ horror atmosphere+ various enemy types+ weapons & their upgrades+ save & inventory systems+ level design+ epic boss fights+ cool storyCONS:- bad optimization for visuals & controls- jump scares stop being interesting after a while- couple of graphical & AI glitchesComment:First let me get the mundane stuff out of the way. Turn v-sync off, otherwise there are big mouse issues. Also tweak the settings a bit, maybe even an .ini file, to make the game handle as nicely as possible. It is a console port and not a very well optimized one. HOWEVER, once you go through this you can start to enjoy this awesome game. One of the most thrilling games I have played. After the fantastic beginning sequence of the game you start your horrible journey. You are a space engineer and after some stuff happens you are basically alone...in space...with a HUGE bunch of monsters that look like the cast of a body horror movie. And indeed gore, blood and decapitations are a strong part in this game. But the scary part is the anticipation, the fear of what awaits you behind the next corner. The sounds, the corpse-filled rooms, the blood trails. And the damn ventilation jump scares. Although honestly you get really used to these after a while. But there is still enough monster variety to keep it fresh. Also the story is nice, nothing super original, but enjoyable. I like the level design and I have to give praise to the boss battles which I liked a lot. The amosphere is excellent through most of the game. All of this made me play in shorter sessions because I could not handle the stress, but that is something you WANT from a horror game. Recommended!P.S.: the low game time is because I played the game DRM-free before and I just wanted to try and see how it works on Steam			"

												This game... this game is AMAZING!  I play the friggin CRAP out of this game, and love every minute of it!  What's not to like?

You won't regret it!On a side note, it might be scary at first, as the first time I ever played any Dead Space, it scared the crap out of me... but I'm used to it now, and it's only a bit spooky at times.Again, I play the crap out of this game because it's so awesome!

Okay okay, had to get it out.  Everybody criticizes this game for being too much like RE4 and I can see that, but it doesn't prevent it from being a good game.  Not really that scary, but definitely very fun.			"

												Dead Space has enough new elements to make a memorable experience out of it. The lack of a HUD, the use of telekenetic powers and the original weapons all contribute to that. Even the setting, a spaceship, is done so well that there is enough variety in the environments. The controls could have been a bit more direct, but Dead Space is still a perfect way to have a few scary nights.Dead Space is solid, but it's not entirely smooth. From a technical point of view, Dead Space is alright. It’s not great, but it holds its own, especially for a console port.			"

												This game is just straight up, no doubt about, 100% fact, awesome. It's also poop your pants scary. The graphics are very dark and detailed, which fits the game just right. The storyline is gripping, extremely intense, and, well, scary! Did I mention this game is super scary? Anyway, the game manages you to put yourself into the main characters shoes very well, even though Isaac Clarke, the man you play as in the game, does not talk, which something very few games manage to do. The gameplay is very gory, violent, and fun. I'd have to say this is one of my favorite games I played this summer, and I have to say, I don't like a lot of scary games!So in conclusion, Dead Space is just plain awesome, and I look forward to playing Dead Space 2 and 3. If you're looking for a game that is scary, but at the same time, has a great storyline and epic mechanics, then this game is for you.			"

												Back when Dead Space first came out I was really not interested in it. I initially thought it was just a modernized System Shock 2 ripoff. When I play it now I don't really see that. It's actually more Resident Evil 4 in space.You play as Isaac Clark and you're sent with a bunch of engineers to repair this one space ship yadda yadda yadda insert Alien reference here. One thing I should mention about Dead Space is it's a very polished game. The graphics and engine still hold up relatively well, and the lack of heads up display is fairly immersive. The storyline leaves something to be desired but like every game in this genre it has good audio logs.At the very least Dead Space still retains good value for money to this day, and if you enjoyed Resident Evil 4 this will appeal to you greatly.

												Dead Space is a rare kind of game and one of the best linear singleplayer games I've ever had the tremendous pleasure to play. It has profoundly affected me as a gamer and has shown to me that you can do a lot with a little and make a game that not only plays good, but looks good. I feel it is a classic no one should go without, even if one is faint of heart.Dead Space has been out for many years and, by now, it has been thoroughly explored by player and developer alike. Even still, its well-balanced gameplay, mixing satisfying weapons handling, unique dismemberment mechanics, and survival elements that pressure the player throughout the game, leave it as one of the most entertaining third person shooters I've ever played. Interesting balancing of the player's enemy-slowing stasis module and object-manipulating kinesis tool make for unusual puzzles and gunplay that's more than just gunplay. Weapon balance, level design, and enemy variety all make for challenging combat scenarios that can vary greatly in execution with every combination of weapons, stasis use, and kinesis use.Graphically, Dead Space is unusually high in quality for its technical fidelity. While the game has relatively low detail models and textures, its good aesthetic direction, breathtaking animations, and clever manipulation of lighting and effects make for a game that will remain visually pleasing for a long time. Voice acting by its cast and atmosphere by its audio team continue to blow me away in sheer quality, even after nearly a dozen playthroughs between console and PC that have solidifed nearly every turn in my memory. Overall, I feel Dead Space has such cinematic and aesthetic quality that some live action movies fall short in comparison.A linear game such as Dead Space would be little but an on-rails third person shooter without a good story and, with all its great aesthetic traits in mind, it does not fail to disappoint. While not immensely groundbreaking, its often psychologically-oriented horror, novel take on otherwise run-of-the-mill space zombies, and interesting backstory woven into audio and text logs make it thoroughly enjoyable.No game is without its failings somewhere and, while I feel Dead Space's are relatively few, this game most certainly has some. While understandable as part of its placement in the horror genre, movement feels unusually clunky at times. Physics oddities and interaction with moving objects can make for some very bizarre moments, ranging from comically confounding and common ragdoll spasms to infrequent, but frustrating random deaths and object disappearances. Puzzles are often simple and blatantly obvious, usually relying overwhelmingly on the threat of death rather than true complexity.Additionally, Dead Space was made for consoles first, PCs second. Many users have run into issues with gamebreaking bugs resultant from their setup or PC-specific options and other port problems - such as control scheme modification being difficult at times - and, as with any console port, be ready for a little bit of work to get it to play nice. I, personally, did not experience many issues, but caution and patience are advised regardless.Modding in Dead Space is essentially non-existent, to my knowledge, as with many other Electronic Arts-backed titles. I feel the lack of support for a modding community is an incredible shame, as its gameplay and atmosphere could have been ripe candidates for talented and amateur modders alike.In the end, if you don't own Dead Space, whether you prefer action or horror, I strongly urge you to change course and pick it up. It is a title that has thoroughly impressed me and, for a time, restored some faith in Electronic Arts. It is a game that spooked me, challenged me, and satisfied me enough to buy it for both Xbox 360 and PC. It is an experience that I honestly believe you would do yourself a disservice not to try. It has earned every little penny I spent on it and thensome, and I will remember it fondly for years to come.			"

												Personally, this is the best survival horror game I have ever played, even beating out Resident Evil 4 which is also amazing.  Everything about Dead Space is great, you will not find a better atmosphere in any survival horror game, the sounds you will hear and shadows you will see skittering across your screen will keep you in suspense for the majority of the game and while there are jump scares, the majority of the horror is definitely thanks to the sound effects and atmosphere. Our silent protaganist is Isaac Clarke and you can definitely tell that he's not your everyday hero but an engineer sent to the USG Ishimura just for simple repairs..................wrong! Necromorphs of death! YEAH! I highly suggest you play with the lights off and use a headset and see what survival horror is truly about. 15/10 Dead Space.			"

												There are few bad things I can say about this game. It has unskippable cutscenes and dialog. Some of the weapons just ain't great. That's about all. What's left is a thrilling experience and engaging gameplay.You will be fighting corpses twisted by a mysterious plague on a mining ship orbiting an alien world. You will not be a soldier though. You will be a space handyman. Against all expectations, you will be the only hope against this inhuman evil and your weapons will be your tools for the most part.Really I want to leave it at that so you can discover the horrors as Issac, the player character, does.IMPORTANT NOTE: I didn't play this for the longest time because the mouse is super laggy without some tweaks. I'm talking a good second to acknowledge my movements. It is fixable. Search google. It's something to do with the V-Sync implementation. You can override it through your video drivers.			"

												Dead Space provides one of the most interesting stories I have ever heard. A heavily immersive third person horror with a well developed story, as well as unique characters and enemies alike. Weapons and pick-ups are a topic in game that can make your brain think. Health is a vital thing, so you need to think about what med packs you should carry; small, medium, or large. You also must make room for ammo, as you might run out of that in only two rooms! Once you have planned out your inventory space, you can now take in the atmosphere-or not. Incredible sound system and atmosphere has you on edge in every location. When those lights turn out, so do the sounds for a brief moment. Then...BAM! Roar! This kind of encounter brings the chills down your spine like no other! Last but not least, is the story. To be honest, the story was the true reason I kept playing, as every chapter kept getting more and more interesting. If you want a scary game to play loud and proud on a dark and stormy night, this will be a keeper.			"

												U won't be able to feel your feet after the total immersion absorbs all your attention into the twisted world. consume your upgrade nodes carefully as they will greatly improve your chance of survival if used wisely(in the hardest mode ofc)turn off the light, up the volumn and embrace the horror in the dead space!

												Highly recommended if you're willing to put up with a wonky port. Vsync locks the game to 30 fps, but running over 60 fps results in gamebreaking bugs. You might be able to fix that by forcing Vsync in your video card control panel, but I have a 144Hz monitor and it didn't work for me, even when I set my monitor to 60Hz.Also, there is awful negative mouse acceleration that makes playing this game with M+K really difficult. Some people have reported that locking to 60 fps fixes that too, but as with the bugs it didn't work for me. So, I ended up playing this game in ""console mode"" at 30 fps with a controller. That was actually OK, as good frame pacing and tactfully implemented motion blur make 30 fps totally fine in this game, and the shooting is not awful with a controller since it's relatively short-range and imprecise.Anyway, if you're not familiar with Dead Space, it's a survival-action horror-ish game where you have to dismember your enemies by cutting off their limbs rather than shooting them in the head or the body. The combat is excellent and very weighty and visceral. You have to cut, stomp, and bludgeon your enemies to death with engineering tools rather than shoot them run-and-gun style like in many shooter games. You also get to scavenge for ammo, health packs, and power nodes to help upgrade your armor and ammo. It's got a resource management component, but I didn't find that keeping my ammo well-stocked was all that hard.It takes place on a mining starship where the crew have all been infected with an alien parasite that transforms them into the limb-swinging monsters you have to fight. There's a lot more backstory, of course, but to reveal it would be to spoil the fun of uncovering what happened. You learn about the story from clues in the environment itself, rather it's text notes or messages scrawled in blood on the wall. There aren't too many jumpscares - the game is more gory than scary. The level design is linear but gives you just enough freedom to make you feel like you're in a real place and not a corridor. It's clearly dated graphically, but the design aesthetic of the game is consistent and compelling - this is a game world that's fun to look at and explore, even though it's full of gore.Overall, definitely worth a look if you're one of the 2 people who haven't played it yet, but be aware of the PC port issues before buying.

YouTube™ Video: Dead Space - Just 15 Minutes 

			Views: 51		

			Dead Space is a science fiction survival horror video game developed by EA Redwood Shores (now Visceral Games) for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.		

I was interested to play a new kind of survive horror games, sci-fi like theme, and I don't know why, but I have necessity to feel scared playing games like Resident Evil, Fatal Frame and others... Maybe because of the adrenaline? Who knows? Well... I feel fear playing horror games, but it's fun! (I laught so much playing games like, Fatal Frame series.)When I saw Dead Space first time, I put it as top of my wish list!Few months after, I challenge myself to play it! The main chracter Isaac and the crew was locked at Ishimura starship, and a lot of bad things was happening! I need to know how it could ended! All the time Isaac needs to do anything to progress at Ishimura, like search for new places, Find keys, Save ammo, collect upgrades, back to old areas, stay fright and kill monsters (dismember they! Remember it!) etc...Now a days Dead Space is an old game, However it's still good. Graphics, show age if compared with others games of the genere. Sound, voice act and playability are excellent. Is possible feel that bad sensation of insecurity... It's necessary some pratice, and stay prepared... Be scared is something that nobody could escape here!I really recommend this game. But consider that is a horror game with rivers of blood . You need have guts to go foward... Like other games of the genere, death is ever close of you...			"

												So as of late I've been pretty bored with games. I've played Mass Effect and found that fun, have been mulling around on Ori  and the Blind Forrest, and have even bought and dowloaded other games that just don't seem to hold my attention. Well, I got some news for you, because I literally have played this game over a four day period from start to finish and loved every minute of it. Dead Space brought horror and dread back into my gaming library like no other game has in a long time. I'm not one for horror games, but if you enjoy sci-fi/action/horror and games like Mass Effect I HIGHLY reccomened you try this game! Pros:- Great use of multiple weapons and different functions for each weapon- Unique grotesque monsters designed off of actual dead and multilated corpses for extra dramatic effect- Enemies are difficult to kill in the sense that they have their own mechanics as in how to kill them all (cutting off limbs etc)- The character Issac may be a silent hero, but certainly a badass for going through some f@$ked up sh#t. - Unique Horror and jump scares- Sound design is wonderful, and you'll learn to hate violin after this game. (Lol)- Good use of starvation on items in certain sections of the game to make you feel like you're at impossible odds until you win.Cons:- Controls are odd and clunky at first, and melee animations and usage is nearly pointless and difficult to actually use- A maze like game where scenery stays stagnent for most of the game and can be boring at times when you enter a room designed like previous ones to know what lies ahead (obviously some baddies from a vent or from a wall)- The game can be very easily manipulated by the player after understanding all monster mechanics, and cheese strating enemies by knowing they cannot enter certain rooms or hallways. (By this I mean using a hallway with a door to protect you, running up so the door opens and popping shots to kill some baddies, then backing away from the door to stay shielded in your safe room)- Ammo clutter for weapons you didn't purchase because the only two weapons you'll ever need is the assult rifle and the pizza cutter (If you play the game, you'll undertsand why i call it the pizza cutter lol.)- underwhelming mini bosses and boss fights using the same mechanics as mobs, or using the same enemy as a boss multiple times.All in all, Dead Space was awesome and I thouroughly enjoyed it! It has its ups and downs with boss battles or mechanics when in Zero gravity and more. But over all it was a fun theatrical experience with many scares. I had blood rushing through my body most of the game. It is loaded with creepy errie sounds coming from vents, objects in the world, dead boddies, and whispers and cries coming from the distance. I can't wait to start playing Dead Space 2! And that's exactly what I intend to do after giving my thoughts on the first one. :)			"

												This is how action/horror should be done- SLOW BURN. I've played this game twice on both 360 and PS3 and now PC. Still a blast. +Simple but engrossing story with a small cast of memorable characters and great voice acting+Even after 5+ play throughs, its extremely satisfying dismembering enemies. Just the crunching sounds alone are fantastic...you can even stomp and crush their bones which is awesome+Lots of scary moments+It IS linear but theres plenty of freedom to go where you want and if you *do* get lost you can simply tap the RS stick and it'll show you where to go+Silent protagonist is always welcome +Nice variety of weapons with a simple but satisfying upgrade system+I like how the inventory, store, and upgrade station are in real time to keep you in the game and the tension high+No stupid silly ""epic"" moments like so many modern games do today (and back in 2008 too)+Even in almost 2017 the game still looks great and runs @ 60fps 1080p+Includes New Game+ to play on harder difficulties with all your equipment. -Seems like if i exit the game and come back to it, my graphics settings were bumped down to medium. Had to manually do this a few times.  -No achievements like the console versions (a very small minor gripe though)And one of the best things- if you beat this game and loved it like i did and wonder if Dead Space 2 is any good well...let me just say it does *everything* right. Reminded me how Resident Evil 2 improved so much from the first game. This is like that. :)9/10 "

												This game is just straight up, no doubt about, 100% fact, awesome. It's also poop your pants scary. The graphics are very dark and detailed, which fits the game just right. The storyline is gripping, extremely intense, and, well, scary! Did I mention this game is super scary? Anyway, the game manages you to put yourself into the main characters shoes very well, even though Isaac Clarke, the man you play as in the game, does not talk, which something very few games manage to do. The gameplay is very gory, violent, and fun. I'd have to say this is one of my favorite games I played this summer, and I have to say, I don't like a lot of scary games!So in conclusion, Dead Space is just plain awesome, and I look forward to playing Dead Space 2 and 3. If you're looking for a game that is scary, but at the same time, has a great storyline and epic mechanics, then this game is for you.			"

												AMAZING survival horror, and probably the GORIEST survival horror.

The atmosphere is AMAZING and it also has many stressful and eerie moments that you must play through.

												Personally, this is the best survival horror game I have ever played, even beating out Resident Evil 4 which is also amazing.  Everything about Dead Space is great, you will not find a better atmosphere in any survival horror game, the sounds you will hear and shadows you will see skittering across your screen will keep you in suspense for the majority of the game and while there are jump scares, the majority of the horror is definitely thanks to the sound effects and atmosphere. Our silent protaganist is Isaac Clarke and you can definitely tell that he's not your everyday hero but an engineer sent to the USG Ishimura just for simple repairs..................wrong! Necromorphs of death! YEAH! I highly suggest you play with the lights off and use a headset and see what survival horror is truly about. 15/10 Dead Space.			"

												There are few bad things I can say about this game. It has unskippable cutscenes and dialog. Some of the weapons just ain't great. That's about all. What's left is a thrilling experience and engaging gameplay.You will be fighting corpses twisted by a mysterious plague on a mining ship orbiting an alien world. You will not be a soldier though. You will be a space handyman. Against all expectations, you will be the only hope against this inhuman evil and your weapons will be your tools for the most part.Really I want to leave it at that so you can discover the horrors as Issac, the player character, does.IMPORTANT NOTE: I didn't play this for the longest time because the mouse is super laggy without some tweaks. I'm talking a good second to acknowledge my movements. It is fixable. Search google. It's something to do with the V-Sync implementation. You can override it through your video drivers.			"

												Heads up, if you listen to the wanks that are whining about the controls please read this before you miss this game.You are wearing a fork lift because Isaac is an engineer. He uses his suit to do heavy lifting. It is quite heavy itself and slow to move around in. So, you will feel it when you move. It is much heavier than what the security guy and the computer gal wear. You will feel like the suit is heavy (it is), top heavy (that too) and fairly tough. It can function in space for short periods of time, so it is not a pair of coveralls.Also, note that his first weapon (and my favorite) is a plasma cutter. Works great in the environment as intended, and not too bad in the new environment he is facing. I jumped back into the game, on sale(!), and it was like old times. Learn to cut the limbs, figure out how to adjust the blade. READ the command prompts BEFORE you exit them. Help is focused on KB/M so I had to futz around remembering how the controller mapped to the functions.If you use a KB/M ... well you are sort of on your own. Sorry, the game was designed for consoles and game controllers. That is how I played it and that is how I am playing it this time.Save points are little access points mounted on the walls. Learn to look for them early. Think old school console save points, like sitting down in Ico or sleeping in Fallout games.			"

												Yes, this game has weird mouse controls. Now, with all the negatives out of the way, this is hands down one of the greatest survival horror games out there -- that is, if you play it on Hard or higher (a strange bug causing your game to suddenly switch difficulty from Hard to Normal has however yet not been resolved and never will be). Love atmospheric survival horror but feel like being unable to defend yourself is not fun? Dead Space has you covered -- in layers of blood. Yes, one or two well placed shots to limbs (great system, headshots make no sense here anyway) can disarm (har har) the enemy, but the same pretty much applies to you -- ignore an enemy and say goodbye to half of your medpacks.Yes, this game utilizes jumpscares. A lot. But it also loves to fake them with long build-ups that result in a vent cover simply falling off. Together with DS2, this is THE survival horror series of our time. And yes, DS2 has superior gameplay, but it lacks the Alien-like atmosphere of this one. And DS3 lacks the ability to let your wallet intact (don't bother).Recommended: Do Unitologists like Markers?

I can't tell you how lame this is almost like they were only thinking of consoles when doing the pc/steam port and everytime no one goes over the input map for the game to change over to pc. Whom ever is responsible for that snafu well you suck i hate your game would never buy another.			"

												Dead Space is one of the best survival action horror games out there. Is it resident evil 4, no. That dosen't mean it's bad. It's hard to be as good as RE4. It is a game that has some really great parts (first chapter is one of my favorite first levels ever) and some god awful parts ( boss fights, cluster♥♥♥♥ rooms). Either then the boss fights being bad (the regenerator is just a easy, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ nemesis) and being put into combos like it's mahvel and being able to buy ammo (makes the game way easier) it's just a few things from making this game top tier. I highly recomend this game and if you don't play this on hard, you're a casual.9/10 would poop myself againAlso one of EA's few good games!			"

												This game holds up way better than I expected it to. For me it feels like they put Metroid Prime and Resident Evil 4 into a blender and created this beatiful survivor/horror game. As you go on through out the game your skills progress and you find different strategies for how to tackle an enemy. You also can upgrade your suit by buying a new one with credits at the store, and you can upgrade your weapons at benches by spending power nodes which are scattered all over the place. I've been playing the game on hard difficulty, and I'm using mouse and keyboard. It's not that hard of a game, once you figure out the game's core you'll be fine in no time. I would however only recommend this game only to people who don't have a weak stomach. I can't eat or drink while playing, because my body just wants to vommit at some of the grotesque stuff you come across. Enjoy! 9/10			"

												I have had some mixed feelings about this game, but then again this happens for a lot of horror games I've played. I'm not a big fan of jumpscares as I feel them being a cheap way to enthrill. Then again I've played this game through 3 times and the reason for that is that this game has a very good gameplay. It has some mediocre issues in storytelling and atmosphere that prevents this being an outstanding game. Instead, this is just good.I have played all parts of the series, except third installement is still uncompleted. Then again the third one didn't seem to have anything to do with the first one so I though I might as well review this now.The plot of the game is pretty generic. In space no one can hear you scream. Weird monsters invade space ship and the protagonist must fight back after their immediate escape possibilities are cut down. Plot starts immediately and isn't very surprising at any point. Player travels back and forth in the ship doing stuff while other characters in the game stand still and cry. Kendra Daniels is one of the most annoying side characters I've so far seen or heard in a game.The part where this game excels is that it makes the playing part fun, although the plot is uninsteresting. By giving the possibility to cut limbs instead of just shooting aliens, this game makes the fights somewhat more interesting and more pleasing. In a fight with multiple enemies, one can shoot their legs off before move to finishing them with another weapon. Also by making playable character a walker instead of a runner, the game is much better paced than some other horror games. Sure he can run, but he cannot shoot while running and running usually ends in a situation where a necromorph is close enough to hug Isaac.Then again even though the pacing excels, this is yet another example where I think the game could've used a real director(like movies have). Though the game tries to be a horror game, it rarely excels in it. Most of the enemies are given away by loud roars or sudden violin sounds. Basically player just turns to where ever the sound came and shoots. Some jump scares are not enough to call it a horror game. It's a jump-scare-game. I'm not afraid of jumpscare, I just don't like them, like sewage. The game loses a lot of atmosphere by doing this. Games scaries part are the vacuum scenarios where no sound is played, so one must stay alert all the time for the enemy. Also there are occasionally so many enemies that I felt like playing a shooter instead of atmospheric horro game.The game is really cheap today(2,5eur in sales) so no hurt trying. Easiest difficulty setting is enough to take any challenge out of the game if one feels like going it just for the story, although some atmosphere is lost by doing this.To anyone suffering mouse problems, try V-sync out and force v-sync from video driver software or utilities like radeonpro. Also playable without v-sync but some say they've had problems related to one door not opening. Also playing without any kind of vsync might cause coil whine in gpu with FPS running over 200 with better cards(2012 enthusiast ->)I recommend this game as a nice way to pass 8-10 hours, but don't expect anything great out of it. It's solid and it's good enough to give it a try. If you don't like it, don't buy the next installements either, they give nothing more.			"

												Haven't gotten around to finishing it yet but, if you like scary games, this is definitely the one for you. While it does have some jump scares, like many games of this type do, it doesn't rely on them in any way, shape, or form. Dead Space is all about ambiance. Almost no matter where you go, there's deep dark shadows where things can lurk, twisted and broken scenery from past struggles, gaps in the walls, ceilings, and floors so that you can see the creatures crawling between walls and into vents. Then there's the sound. At all times there's the sounds of loose metal clanking, echoes of transmissions being broadcast and some of the eeriest music you'll find on a game. All of this combines to engender a feeling of constant anxiety while playing.			"

												It's the original Dead Space... It uses the tried and true Resident Evil 4 formula and it works... it's creepy, it's actually scary, it's a survival horror with a sci-fi theme that doesn't actually suck like most movies of the same genre.After this one they fall heavily off the track and by Dead Space 3 you have a co-op 3rd person action horror game for the casuals that can't play games alone in the dark without shatting themselves.Stick with the original if you want a true survival horror experience.

												Dead Space is the classic definition of horror. This game made me feel so uncomfortable and disgusted, yet so attached and interested. It has a good story, filled with mistery and conspiracy. Everything about the game feels right and natural. It delivers a solid gameplay, which consists of exploring and fixing a huge ship, fighting an endless variety of necromorphs, playing with gravity, crafting and upgrading equipment, uncovering the truth about what happened, and just trying to survive. You get to be Isaac Clarke, the ""speechless"" protagonist of the game, who slowly goes insane while under the effects of a ""relic"" called - The Marker.    The game's name is the perfect description of how the game feels. Everything seems so cold, so lifeless, diseased and abandoned. Everywhere you look, it's just cold metal walls, dry blood spilled on the floor and doors, rotten bodies everywhere and flickering xenon lights. Aside the ship, there are also times when you have to go ""outside"". The space looks gorgeous. It's dark and dangerous, but also endlessly beautiful. All of these create an unforgettable atmosphere, full of terror, shock and dementia. I wish I could say ""Don't worry, it's not that scarry."" But I can't. You will get scared. Even when you tread carefully, trying to notice the vents or ducts from where the necromorphs might come, you'll still get surprised every time. The developers have scripted the game so well, that it's impossible not to get scared. You'll start getting used to the monsters after a while. And when you're letting your guard down for a minute, just when you least expect it, you get a instant heart attack and a broken chair.   Dead Space makes you feel absolutely stranded, alone, but not helpless. The player can choose from a variety of weapons and tools. Which not only look cool, but also behave differently. And each of those weapons can be found and upgraded at the Work Benches. You also get to use Kinesis, which is totally awesome. Especially when combined with the Stasis. But what I liked the most most, was the suit. The RIG, as they call it, can also be upgraded and augumented. I just loved it. It looked so armored and heavy, and cold. But also so very cool and protective. The game becomes more challenging as you progress. There are new types of monsters lurking the corridors, wishing to get their... hands/paws/claws/teeth/blades/tails/tentacles/quills/proboscis/pustules and other limbs around your neck. But besides all those gruesome and brutal deaths, there are also other things that can and will kill you if you're not careful enough. Such as getting hit with some massive spinning tethers, getting electrocuted, running out of air, being hit with a meteorite, jumping into open space, and my personal favorite - getting crushed by a door. That's just what I remember anyway. But I'm sure there's a lot more to choose from.    Another absolutely great feature of this game is the sound and music. Everything sounds just right. Shooting sounds awesome. Stomping and punching the necromorphs feels so very satisfying, because I always found myself crushing every body I saw. Which is a little strange come to think of it... Oh, and the music. I don't know if you can really call it music, because it's mainly a series of very well done ambient soundtracks. Always tensionate, rhythmic, and terror-inducing. Nothing scares me more than a rotten-baby-tentacle-monster jumping on me, while some extremely loud and terrifying chimes are playing on the background. But it was also... fun. I liked to be scared. And if you like to be scared too, this is it my friend.   Although this game was made back in 2008, it looks fantastic. It has got awesome lightning, good-looking models and a most satisfying dismembering system. You can literally tear someone's limbs apart, one by one. And a good physics engine that allows you to do a lot of crazy stuff with those gravity boots.   Finally, a must play. It's a shame I haven't played this a long time ago. This game delivers an amazing experience, full of horror and action. With a good story and lovely sound design.   You need to hear this.  10/10 "

												Excellent game, very moody and very creepy. Finally a new IP that takes horror seriously.It gets more action oriented about halfway through though, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing as the atmosphere will still be tense. The menus also integrate well into the gameplay without pausing the entire game so you have to keep on your toes at all times. Since the game takes place in space the graphics are a bit futuristic, but still dark. The voice overs are very good (your character doesn't speak though) and the sounds are just amazing.If you love horror games, make sure this is on your 'to play' list., I guarantee you won't be disappointed.[Rating: 89/100]			"

												Dead Space is one of those horror games that EVERYONE should own. The entire trilogy is worth every penny spent. The first game isn't perfect. It's flawed, it has issues, it's not really scary - but it's a damn good game.GRAPHICS: Visually, the game has aged quite a bit, but the graphics do their job. The game is every much as visceral and gory and disgusting as you could want, filled with Saw-like moments that leave you wanting to throw up.SOUND/MUSIC: The musical score isn't too special, but it does its job. Most of the soundtrack is composed of typical horror themes that play during jump scare moments. The sound design, however, is fantastic - every monster, gun, creak and groan of the ship; all of them set you on edge. There's never a moment where you feel safe, even on the easiest difficulty with the most maxed out character you could ever create. It's simply a wonder for horror fans.STORY: Story-wise, Dead Space is possibly one of the most unoriginal pieces ever conceived. If Ridley Scott's Alien was merely Jaws in space, then Dead Space is just Ridley Scott's Alien but with zombies. The plot is predictable, the characters on-dimensional and unlikable in every conceivable way, and the twists and turns so dull and emotionless that it makes M. Night Shyamalan look good by comparison. This game isn't really going to satisfy people searching for deep, interesting, unique lore by any stretch, but it's good enough to compel you to complete the game.GAMEPLAY: This is where the game flops - or at least, the PC version does. I played Dead Space on the Xbox 360 long before I had a functioning PC that could run anything more demanding than Solitare, and even then, the gameplay was clunky, but it at least worked. The PC version seems like it wasn't tested at all. The mouse and keyboard controls are abysmal and practically broken. The aiming in particular is so bugged that it's nearly impossible to hit your targets without wasting half of your ammo, and when it comes to the Dead Space formula (shoot off the limbs) that requires precision, it's absolutely ludicrous that the developers would skimp out on testing the most important part of the game. The Dead Space franchise has always had stellar gameplay: there's no hud, leaving you to see your health meter, ammo, and other such important pieces of information on your guns or armour. The gameplay consists of strategically shooting the limbs off of your opponents, and it's a blast to play, but even when I plug my Xbox controller into my PC, the port simply barely works. I've played this game for years, and can't even begin to count the amount of unnecessary deaths I've experienced on the PC port due to bad controls that hindered my ability to aim. The sad part is, I TRULY love this game, but with controls that are so dysfunctional, I doubt that I'll ever pick it up on my PC again.I wish there was an in-between rating, because the game is DEFINITELY worth playing, but people should be warned about the bad controls. Overall, if you can find a series of mods that will keep you from destroying your PC from the rage that this game will put you through due to the devs refusing to test it out, then you should DEFINITELY buy it.

												Dead Space is a survival horror game where you play a mute space engineer named Isaac Clarke. Isaac is a tragic character. When he was a child, malfunctioning SecuRom DRM prevented him from playing his favourite game. This traumatised him so badly he never spoke again. Although he occasionally yells ""Fark EA"", but nobody knows what that means.Isaac and his team are on their way to the Japanese mining ship USG Kutabare because a rare Pokemon that they want has been spotted on board. The USG Kutabare is a huge Chinko class mining ship that strip mines entire planets for rare minerals like Tiberium, Adamantium, Kryptonium and Unobtanium. Also, Isaac's attractive girlfriend Nicole is there and he's hoping to catch up with her for some surreptitious zero-gravity nookie.When they arrive near the USG Kutabare they suspect that something is wrong. Not only is the mining ship not responding, there are no Greenpeace ships in sight and no environmental activists chaining themselves to asteroids. Unbeknownst to Isaac and his team, something has indeed gone horribly wrong on board the ship, and its status is now officially 'clitical[www.engrish.com]'. That means 'seriously bad' in Japanese.Upon docking, they find the ship strangely deserted, and this is where the true horror begins. Some chick named Kendra starts telling Isaac what to do despite her not being his girlfriend or his wife. Isaac go get the keycard. Isaac go open that door. Isaac go fix the tram. Isaac put the toilet seat down. Isaac has to do everything she says. Seriously scary stuff. Admittedly Kendra is rather hot and perhaps Isaac is hoping to catch up with her for some surreptitious zero-gravity nookie.Anyway after much faffing about, Isaac discovers a sinister conspiracy involving the colony on the planet below. Hoping that there might be some colonist's daughters he could rescue from their virginity, he decides to investigate further. Apparently the colonists found an ancient alien obelisk thousands of years old. They also unearthed a box of McDonald's Cheeseburgers buried in the dirt that was also thousands of years old, but still edible. However no one was impressed because you could still buy McDonald's Cheeseburgers from the colony cafeteria that were older than that.During the excavation of the alien obelisk, the colonists accidentally released a contagious alien saprophytic parasite that contaminated the entire colony. This insidious alien parasite is not only highly virulent but capable of transforming corpses into monsterous human-porkchop hybrids called Necrochops. Mistaking the alien parasite for Curry Vindaloo, the colonists ate most of it during their Thanksgiving celebrations and were sadly all transformed into slavering monsters. Dumb♥♥♥♥♥colonists.Following in the footsteps of horror themed luminaries such as the F.E.A.R. and Residential Evil series, Dead Space is certainly not an original concept. What it does do incredibly well however is the atmosphere. Soft, almost indistinct susurration permeate the ship. Corpses, severed limbs, and other unidentified viscera litter the claustrophobic corridors. Blood splatters decorate the walls like the abstract art of some deranged artist. Lights flicker and occasionally go out. The feeling of paranoia, dread, and unease is palpable. This is the closest you'll ever get to the experience of being afraid and alone on a desolated ship beset by monsters. Other than going on a Contiki Cruise as an attractive nubile female.There are obligatory jump-scares, although they are used sparringly and not ingeminated to the point of banality. Incidentally, never trust corpses. Not because they send scam emails but because some of them have a disconcerting habit of re-animating at inopportune times. Conveniently, Isaac has a stomp attack and it's your sacred duty to stomp every single corpse into so much tenderised porkchop. It's the only way to be sure.Because Isaac is only an engineer, and not some tough Space Marine, most of his weapons are construction equipment that he uses in ways that contravene every single Health & Safety regulation in existence. Who would have thought the humble Plasma Cutter would be a good for impromptu face reconstruction surgery. But desperate times and all that. Fortunately for Isaac, he's on a Japanese ship and you can buy everything from ubiquitous vending machines; from dangerous weapons and ammunition to schoolgirl panties.The action of Dead Space is similar to the tactical 3rd-person aim-shoot style of Resident Evil instead of the FPS run-and-gun style of F.E.A.R. and Bioshock. What Dead Space does uniquely is the innovative selective dismemberment combat system where the good old Double Tap head-shot just doesn't cut it anymore. Severing the various articulated appendages of your target is the key to victory. Isaac also gets a stasis ability that allows him to violate the Laws of Physics by slowing time. It's used mainly for crowd control when surrounded by Necrochops and useful for getting that perfect sirloin cut.Dead Space has a steep difficulty curve, similar to Bioshock and Resident Evil 4, where the game is initially difficult because of weak weapons and sparse ammunition but gets easier after weapon and suit upgrades. Isaac has a melee attack, but it's about as effective as arguing with strangers on the Internet. Completing the game unlocks a New Game+ mode that allows you to retain your equipment and upgrades in the previous playthrough, but only on the same difficulty. Starting a new game in a higher difficulty resets your equipment back to nothing.Barring a few exceptions, Dead Space has aged rather well. It runs in 1080p with good frame rates and still looks good. However there are some problems with VSync on modern machines that prevents progress but workarounds are available. Also glitchy PhysX can sometimes cause corpses to catapult around the room, but the effect is more hilarious than horrific.Highly recommended for fans of space horror movies like Alien, Event Horizon, Prometheus, and Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens. This is one of those games that is best experienced in the quiet of the night, in a dark room, wearing brown underpants. Also best played alone. In space, no one can hear your girly screams.			"

												SCARY. That is the short review. Since its been a while since I played it, that is the overrall tone of the game. You play as Isaac, an engineer who just can't catch a break. You go to investigate a ship that has gone dark and is in need of repair. Boy does it need repair. The game has jump scares which I don't find to be a negative because there is tons of others stuff that should creep you out. The ship is a character, as you piece the story together through various videos, documents, and audio journals. It is a creepy story. Also, you feel very alone. Even though you arrive with a small team, it quickly becomes apparent that no one can really help you. I like to think of the monsters as space zombies, and man are they freaky. Instead of the normal pop them in the head method, you have to take care of the limbs instead. There is a nice variety of weapons and armor to keep you on par with the nightmares you face. This is a game meant for playing after 10 PM with a good set of headphones. The ending is great and creepy and gets you ready for Dead Space 2. Even though it relies on shooting and blasting your way through, you will be on pins and needles the whole way through, wondering if your gun is enough to get you through in one piece.			"

												Dead Space is a First Person Shooter-Horror game where you arrive at a Spaceship which has ceased communication and must figure out what has happened to the crew. You make your way through various levels of the ship and learn about the horrors that have taken place, while fighting a variety of creatures who have infested the ship. With monsters that jump out around every corner, the game offers a fast-paced, fright-fest and should not be played by the feint of heart.I don't have to give away any more of the plot as it is a pretty interesting storyline. The learning curve is fairly decent and the game is fun on the hardest settings for the experienced FPS'er. Graphically speaking the game looks pretty good, the lighting is fantastic and adds to the thrill and horror of the gameplay. Dead Space is a good game to purchase and has been successful enough to spawn sequels			"

												If you want to play this game, play it on a console.PC version is extremely buggy and crashes frequently. The game was not made to be played with a mouse. Menus are only navigable with arrow keys, mouse sensitivity is ♥♥♥♥ed up, cannot turn off mouse acceleration. Zero-G jumps onto uneven surface or at too shallow an angle consistently causes freezing and death. ""Continue"" instead of ""Load Game"" will sometimes change your game difficulty, with no way to change it back.Half way through a run on Hard, I got bugged down to Medium and the game became trivial. There was almost no increase in difficulty for the second half of the game. I spent the entire game drowning in ammo and money. You start with the best weapon in the game; the rest are irrelevant. Very few of my deaths were attributable to enemies. Most of them were environmental deaths, and about half of those were the previously mentioned Zero-G bug. Final boss was underwhelming.Those things aside, the game was okay. Story was decent I guess. Gameplay was fine when not bugging. I had enough fun to finish it, but I'm probably never coming back to it.			"

												I was nearly ten years late to this game, and yet it is one of the most engrossing games i have ever played. Somehow, in 1440p, with everything turned up, the graphics of the game still held up to a contemporary strandard (yes, with some dull textures here and there, but damn.) I am sure the atmospheric nature of the game helps in this aspect. Anyways, about the game itself. PLAY IT IF YOU HAVE NOT ALREADY.I mean common', you some sort of loser like me who waits a decade to play one of the best games created? You lame or something? Why are you even reading reviews about Dead Space, you should be playing it. 10/10 would beg brothers again to stay in room while i play.			"

												Dead Space will suck you into it's creepy madness, leaving you gasping for a breather. Dead Space is an incredible game, great storyline and incredible atmospher. It is a disturbingly gruesome deep-space adventure that will haunt your dreams and leave you begging for more.......I still have nightmars about the mouse thank god for the controller......however appart from the sluggish mouse movement, which feels strangely slow i had high hopes for this game and i am definitely going to grab Dead Space 2.Rise and take control			"

												A combination of Doom 3 and Resident Evil. The game won't bring you down to your knees, but still is quite enjoyable. Not as scary as D3,  it occasionally is. The way you control the character is quite unique, but one can adapt quickly to it. If you have some spare time and want to play a decent (but not an extraordinary) horror shooter, then that's your game.			"

												Great game its stuff we have already seen before just like the Resident evil series this game will make you poop your pants when you least expect it!. Its not true survival horror its more akin to the arcadey RE4 style of gameplay where you can buy ammo/weapons/health kits from a shop and store your valuable equipment and any supplies you find along the way and you can also upgrade your weapons/suit whenever you find a workbench in game. What sets it apart is definantly its atmosphere every rattle and shadow somehow makes you look around to make sure there isnt a flesh eating alien necro trying to sneek up behind you to claim you as its dinner tonight.A great experience yet im not entirely sure about the replay value as its taken me near 21hrs to complete it on my first playthrough I took my time and explored pretty much everywhere I picked the game up when it was about £4 and can honestly say its worth even the current price of £9.99 Great game, dont forget to wear head phones turn off the lights and have a clean pair of underpants on hand to get the best out the game ;D "

												Well, what can I say about this Video Game. It has lots of big spooky monsters. They look like something out of Grandpa's medication induced nightmares. The game has stellar features that even Grandpa can figure out, first there is a stomping feature that allows the main character to open crates on the ground, inside these crates are Arthritis Medicine and bullets for the main gun which shoots lasers (I wish we had this back when we were fighting those damned krauts). The game is very long, almost as long as it takes me to get the channel clicker to move to the next one. This game seemed to cater well to Grandpa's growing Alzheimers, it seems to tell what is going on whenever.What was I talking about again? Oh yes, I believe this nickel is for you, Billy...but don't tell your father I gave this to you, he might put me in a home. (laughs)Grandpa is always proud of you, Billy. Stay in school. "

												As a shooter, sure, I can definitely recommend this, but don't go into this game expecting horror. Maybe I'm just not affected by it but I didn't find what I've played so far to be scary in any way. I don't mean that as trying to say I'm tough either. I'd never played a horror game or seen a horror movie before and actually wanted to try one out to see if I'd enjoy it. What I got was dark corridors and the occasional jumpscare. I eventually grew to expect them as well. At one point I was in an elevator and took a few seconds to stretch. When the doors opened I saw a mutant, and wasn't surprised at all. I calmly reached for my mouse and took aim.Again, as a shooter, I think this game does a great job. You're encouraged to stay far from enemies and when you shoot you're told to dismember them for more damage. The game does a pretty good job of setting the atmosphere as well.One fallback I saw with it were the ragdoll physics. Maybe its just the time it came out but they seemed silly. I'd kill an enemy and go to walk past, only to have its body stick between my legs and vibrate. I don't think its that big of a deal, but if you do, be warned.If you're looking for something to scare you I suggest finding something else. However, as a dark mystery sci-fi adventure, I can safely say its not bad.			"

												Don't buy this game, it's too scary and you'll have to fight space monsters and stuff. You get sweet guns and kill a bunch of things before they try to kill you. Why in the hell did they dock on this stupid ship in the first place? Didn't they have enough technology to maybe scan the ship and realize there is a bunch of crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥happening? Like, no way would I be going on a big♥♥♥♥♥ship in the middle of space.

												This is a masterpiece of a game and one of my all time favorites, its the thing, event horizon and sillent hill all rolled into one big gore fest, its not the scariest of games but it does cause a few jumps when a creature sneaks up on you and gets up close just as you turn around, and panic can set in when your ammo is nearly spent whilst wiping out a large wave of creatures. This game still look great, the detail and lighting on the ishimura decks is so atmospheric and the creatures are so fantastically squelchy and gross it makes me wonder if many vegetarians can actually play this game without feeling ill.10/10 Full of meaty goodness.

												Replayed this in 2016 after being reminded by it in the ‘EDGE special edition – the 100 greatest video games’, not having touched it since release. Incredibly it stands up enormously today, both in terms of gameplay, graphics, and story. The integration with the game world is complete, focusing on survival, exploration, and tightly choreographed bouts of intense combat. In particular, the sound and monster design is out of this world, making it just as creepy and unsettling as it was back in 2008. While some critics prefer the sequel, I would liken it to the comparison of the film Alien, and Aliens; essentially suspense vs. action.Of the material that inspired it, Alien I strongly prefer, and if like me, you enjoy being sucked into a realistic world of terror in space, this is the one for you.

 Originally posted on May 13, 2011 Event Horizon, Pandorum, Alien, even 2001. All of these films and many other great Sci Fi traditions act as a healthy source base for Dead Space. The game features a distress call, a seemingly silent ship which we quickly realize is dark and full of monsters. Something has gone terribly wrong.The game's carefully crafted atmosphere and surprisingly good voice acting are really what draw you in. Although the plot is very transparent, and the character development (especially for Kendra) is a little weak, the game isn't really about that. It's about living out some version of the space horror fantasy you've had in your head ever since the first time you saw say, Event Horizon. The game has it all, spooky lighting, creepy cultists, a wide array of frightening monsters, and a slowing unfolding backstory involving a typical breakdown of the chain of command and descent into chaos.Playing this game with headphones and in the dark, while alone, even a second time through, is quite an experience. Your heart will pound and you will jump out of your seat.Graphically speaking the game isn't much to look at, and the necromorphs aren't very inspired in their design, although they are scary. Nevertheless, the lighting and audio more than make up for the game's low resolution textures and low poly models.Apart from really wonky object physics, the game feels very good to play as well. The slow turning speed of Isaac, your avatar, contributes to the sense of the game as being about horror/survival, and scavenging is essential. You aren't incredibly vulnerable, especially after upgrades, but you feel like you are, and that's what counts.Ultimately, Dead Space is a surprising and fun guilty pleasure of a game that will remind you of nights spent watching sci-fi horror movies scaring yourself senseless in the dark.

												Great horror game. Gameplay doesn't get boring, mainly because you arent usually aiming for the head like every other shooter. The game also mixes in cool puzzles and turret sections that help keep the game fresh. You feel like a handyman, but you also feel like a badass. If you don't like games where you are alone however, this is NOT the game for you. There is very little interaction with NPC's that aren't enemies.I would recommend this game to anyone who likes a cool futuristic story and art design, and wants to play a tense and scary game too.

												Played the entire game on xbox 360 and have just started again on pc. I remember when I first bought the game for 360 and I knew nothing about the game. The first play through was fantastic and the enviroment is chilling and makes you feel uneasy. I can say that the first time you play through you will have some moments where you tense up from jump scares and the unexpected, but you will get use to it. Even so, the game is one the best horror/survival games I've played in my many years of gaming and pretty scary in my opinion. Would recommend. 9/10			"

												One of my favourite games. Great gameplay, great story, great atmosphere, great level design. Nails the sci-fi + horror setting. The whole series is great, although they veered more and more toward action with each sequel (which I can forgive because you will be so good at shooting off alien limbs by the time you finish 1 & 2 that more of the same in 3 would not have been much challenge).

												Don't buy this game, it's too scary and you'll have to fight space monsters and stuff. You get sweet guns and kill a bunch of things before they try to kill you. Why in the hell did they dock on this stupid ship in the first place? Didn't they have enough technology to maybe scan the ship and realize there is a bunch of crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥happening? Like, no way would I be going on a big♥♥♥♥♥ship in the middle of space. ""Oh we lost contact, better send 3 people to go find out what's up!""... yeah nothing could go wrong thereBut anyway, cool game, cool guns, controls can kinda be janky.8/10 - you should go buy it, ignore what I said earlier.

												This is a masterpiece of a game and one of my all time favorites, its the thing, event horizon and sillent hill all rolled into one big gore fest, its not the scariest of games but it does cause a few jumps when a creature sneaks up on you and gets up close just as you turn around, and panic can set in when your ammo is nearly spent whilst wiping out a large wave of creatures. This game still look great, the detail and lighting on the ishimura decks is so atmospheric and the creatures are so fantastically squelchy and gross it makes me wonder if many vegetarians can actually play this game without feeling ill.10/10 Full of meaty goodness.

												As a shooter, sure, I can definitely recommend this, but don't go into this game expecting horror. Maybe I'm just not affected by it but I didn't find what I've played so far to be scary in any way. I don't mean that as trying to say I'm tough either. I'd never played a horror game or seen a horror movie before and actually wanted to try one out to see if I'd enjoy it. What I got was dark corridors and the occasional jumpscare. I eventually grew to expect them as well. At one point I was in an elevator and took a few seconds to stretch. When the doors opened I saw a mutant, and wasn't surprised at all. I calmly reached for my mouse and took aim.Again, as a shooter, I think this game does a great job. You're encouraged to stay far from enemies and when you shoot you're told to dismember them for more damage. The game does a pretty good job of setting the atmosphere as well.One fallback I saw with it were the ragdoll physics. Maybe its just the time it came out but they seemed silly. I'd kill an enemy and go to walk past, only to have its body stick between my legs and vibrate. I don't think its that big of a deal, but if you do, be warned.If you're looking for something to scare you I suggest finding something else. However, as a dark mystery sci-fi adventure, I can safely say its not bad.			"

												I'm not a fan of jumpscare, but this game has an interesting gameplay. It's less scary when you know the enemies and what to expect (basically if you already watched videos). If you can make it through the first level, the following levels will feel less scary (although the game will still manage to startle you). The controls (character movement and mouse control) are kind of like GTA or any other TPS (Third Person Shooter) you might have played. You can use your mouse to move the camera around your character. Although the mouse control might feel weird and slow at first, you should be able to get used to it. I still had to set mouse sensitivity to 80% though.			"

(this won't be a thorough review because of this and since its been a little while).The horror aspect was well intigrated into the work: actually a legitimate tense horror game by my taste, without really overdoing anything. And, the shooter aspect of the game was not overexagerated.It was difficult at times, but as a whole it was just the right amount of challenging ^-^I haven't gotten into the after beating the game stuff, but I really have nothing to complain about with this one.The closest thing I have to a regret on this one is not buying the second in the same sale xD,but if I ever need another horror game, I know where I might start.

												Dead Space is a game, which ignites my memories of films like Aliens, Lost In Space, and other movies with isolated, or abandoned space vessels.At first I found Dead Space boring, but on my 3rd play-through I eventually got hooked and started to increase further into the game, and story. Dead Space is amazingly eerie, and you have that 'alone' space feeling through-out the main campaign. As I got further into the main story I found myself getting hooked, and thinking to myself 'WOW'! This game is incredible, and for anyone that likes old space movies from the early 80's/90's, then this is the game for you!The plot of Dead Space is simple. You are sent with a crew to investigate a planet mining vessel that sent out a request for help. The game starts with you arriving at that vessel and then you begin to find out what happened, and why the help signal was sent. Not all is as seems however - as the badly damaged vessel seems to be empty upon arrival - Or is it?The story has many twists and turns. It's a story about experimentation, love, and 'what happens when things go wrong'.Dead Space is great! It's thrilling, inventive, and the level-up system, and skill tree is genius.This game is so alike to the scene in 'Lost In Space' when they arrive at the abandoned Space vessel. If you haven't watched Lost In Space, and you haven't played Dead Space - then you NEED to.I rate this game 10/10.			"

												Dead Space is one of my all-time favorites, and in a true sense a masterpiece. I bought and played it upon its original release, and it was pretty much bug free and stable out of the box, even if it pushed my trusty old Core2Duo I had then pretty hard.The design choices, story line (augmented by a couple of animated movies ,""Dead Space: Downfall"" and ""Dead Space: Aftermath""), atmosphere, and gritty industrial Sci-Fi environment, make this a memorable, terrifying, and unique experience. Think of it as an amalgamation of Aliens, Event Horizon, The Thing, and Pandorum. It does have some jump scares, but mainly all the adversaries are manageable, especially since you get to upgrade your gear throughout.You definitely get the feeling of being in space, in particularly due to the very, very awesome Zero-G sequences, and your requirement for Oxygen and the ability to magnetize your boots. This is pretty unique in games, and certainly was a novelty back when Dead Space was released. This is probably the fourth time I've bought the game, for one due to DRM-freeness, and because it's worth it. Of all the games published by EA over the years, the Dead Space (and Mass Effect) franchises are certainly one of the best games ever made.In fact, the only negative I have to say about Dead Space is the ridiculous control/button assignments. Being left handed I do not use WASD, I use the cursor, and surrounding keys, and Dead Space isn't very helpful there. I had to get a program called GlovePIE which I've had to use a few times since. Once setup though, everything works just fine.In conclusion, if you are a Sci-Fi/Horror fan, enjoy a good third person shooter style experience, and enjoy roaming around in beautiful, atmospheric environments, then this is for you! And remember: In space, no one can hear you scream!			"

												guys...what if the deadspace experience is all a dream?   the delusions of the madman engineer isaac clarke, who killed half the crew of the ishimura blew up a mining complex killing thousands and was eventually captured. went to the insane asylum on the sprawl, managed to escape and begin killing again all while a riot was on. and his friend ellie is another crazy person who shares the same delusion and the other guy off the ishimura is thier hostage, they think he is the crazy guy with all the secrets and when he assaults ellie he is actually trying to run for his life? and when all that is done he escaped and was hiding out on a colony, when another ""marker"" appears he killed hundreds more again, those unitologists that were trying to capture him? nope they were the special forces sent in to kill isaac. carver and the other guy? paid mercenarys that were paid by ellie to bring isaac to saftey,  isaac goes to the ice planet with the hope to destroy the planet and the moon killing everybody on the planet but are being chased by special forces,  led by general Danik, the mercenarys dont mind at all as they are being paid billions, enough to retire.  isaac and ellie rip one of the poor colonist apart and cut his limbs and then put him back together to figure secrets out. isaac manages to kill danik and severly kill the special forces morale most of them fleeing the planet, as isaac and carver killed most of them.   isaac only manages to destroy  the moon but the damage is done, without the moon the planet is plunged into chaos, carver does not survive the aftermath and most colonists are killed off in the various earthquakes  and tsunamis, and isaac? he is stuck in a natural cave with no way out left wandering till he eventually dies. and then he wakes up,because it was all a dream, and dreams have no impact on reality, isaac prepares to board the ismimura to repair the ""com arrays"".........

												Dead Space is a game, which ignites my memories of films like Aliens, Lost In Space, and other movies with isolated, or abandoned space vessels.At first I found Dead Space boring, but on my 3rd play-through I eventually got hooked and started to increase further into the game, and story. Dead Space is amazingly eerie, and you have that 'alone' space feeling through-out the main campaign. As I got further into the main story I found myself getting hooked, and thinking to myself 'WOW'! This game is incredible, and for anyone that likes old space movies from the early 80's/90's, then this is the game for you!The plot of Dead Space is simple. You are sent with a crew to investigate a planet mining vessel that sent out a request for help. The game starts with you arriving at that vessel and then you begin to find out what happened, and why the help signal was sent. Not all is as seems however - as the badly damaged vessel seems to be empty upon arrival - Or is it?The story has many twists and turns. It's a story about experimentation, love, and 'what happens when things go wrong'.Dead Space is great! It's thrilling, inventive, and the level-up system, and skill tree is genius.This game is so alike to the scene in 'Lost In Space' when they arrive at the abandoned Space vessel. If you haven't watched Lost In Space, and you haven't played Dead Space - then you NEED to.I rate this game 10/10.			"

												Dead Space is one of my all-time favorites, and in a true sense a masterpiece. I bought and played it upon its original release, and it was pretty much bug free and stable out of the box, even if it pushed my trusty old Core2Duo I had then pretty hard.The design choices, story line (augmented by a couple of animated movies ,""Dead Space: Downfall"" and ""Dead Space: Aftermath""), atmosphere, and gritty industrial Sci-Fi environment, make this a memorable, terrifying, and unique experience. Think of it as an amalgamation of Aliens, Event Horizon, The Thing, and Pandorum. It does have some jump scares, but mainly all the adversaries are manageable, especially since you get to upgrade your gear throughout.You definitely get the feeling of being in space, in particularly due to the very, very awesome Zero-G sequences, and your requirement for Oxygen and the ability to magnetize your boots. This is pretty unique in games, and certainly was a novelty back when Dead Space was released. This is probably the fourth time I've bought the game, for one due to DRM-freeness, and because it's worth it. Of all the games published by EA over the years, the Dead Space (and Mass Effect) franchises are certainly one of the best games ever made.In fact, the only negative I have to say about Dead Space is the ridiculous control/button assignments. Being left handed I do not use WASD, I use the cursor, and surrounding keys, and Dead Space isn't very helpful there. I had to get a program called GlovePIE which I've had to use a few times since. Once setup though, everything works just fine.In conclusion, if you are a Sci-Fi/Horror fan, enjoy a good third person shooter style experience, and enjoy roaming around in beautiful, atmospheric environments, then this is for you! And remember: In space, no one can hear you scream!			"

												Note: Disabling v-sync makes the game unplayableDead space is essentially a modern upgrade of System Shock 2, featuring hideous monsters, gunslinging, and minor puzzles.  The story is well written, the universe is well developed, and the characters, minor or major, are interesting for even the small periods of interaction you have.  Dispite it's linearity, and the fact that the main character has no voice, the game never feels unrelatable, and you find yourself immersed: wandering a derelict vessel trying to figure out how to fix it and get off with your life.  Any complaints I have from this game stem from the out of character and out of context minigames.I played this game with a controller, which felt a lot more natural as the game was designed to use one. There is one sequence of the game where I was forced to use the mouse, but it had nothing to do with the base mechanics of the game, more to do with my above point about minigames.Expect about 12 hours of gameplay, with replayability in a newgame+ mode.Overall, this game is a lot of fun and I would definitely recommend picking it up for a couple sleepless nights of shooting abominations.

												A 2008 game from EA, one of the first games to really take advantage of the atmosphere factor to make a game really immersive and scary, this is an horror game (in a certain way) mixed with some aliens and religious fanatics and you got yourself a mix for a great game.The story was good enough, the gameplay itself was great for that time and it still is, the chapters get kinda repetitive with the same pattern of solving objective and going back to the next area, blah blah, there isnt free will, you follow a linear story so if you dont like linear, ye...But all in all, a good experience and the only criticism to the PC port is the mouse sensitivity issue but there are fixes for that, just check the forums.I bought the Dead Space package and didnt regret it, so my advice is that you do the same and enjoy the crazy adventure of Isaac.8.5/10.

												Going in for a fourth playthrough, this game is still an incredible gem. One of the greatest console ports I've played, one of my all-time favorite scifi horror pieces. Maybe it's not such a pure horror case in the way that Amnesia is but it sure blows Resident Evil games and such out of the water. Atmosphere and audio are incredible. Loud surround sound + vibrating gamepad + Ripper saw = glee! and gore. Concerned neighbours, maybe.Mandatory protip: Do NOT have Vsync on, it is bugged and will screw up your controls, making you think it's a sloppy console job. Other than that I've not found any technical flaws. Supposedly main menu's ""continue game"" can reset your difficulty to Normal, use ""load game"" instead.Protip #2: DO NOT PLAY ON ANYTHING LESS THAN HARD DIFFICULTY. You'll thank yourself later.  Easy/Normal is like playing with god mode. (Impossible difficulty is extra fun but it needs unlocking)The sequel has huge stompin' boots to fill.			"

												Replayed this in 2016 after being reminded by it in the ‘EDGE special edition – the 100 greatest video games’, not having touched it since release. Incredibly it stands up enormously today, both in terms of gameplay, graphics, and story. The integration with the game world is complete, focusing on survival, exploration, and tightly choreographed bouts of intense combat. In particular, the sound and monster design is out of this world, making it just as creepy and unsettling as it was back in 2008. While some critics prefer the sequel, I would liken it to the comparison of the film Alien, and Aliens; essentially suspense vs. action.Of the material that inspired it, Alien I strongly prefer, and if like me, you enjoy being sucked into a realistic world of terror in space, this is the one for you.

												I decided to have another run through of this gem over Halloween - I've owned various copies on various platforms over the years but figured it might as well refresh my memory from my first playthrough back in 2008. For a horror fan, this game is a must. The atmosphere this title manages to evoke is amongst some of the best I've ever come across in my 20-year gaming career. If you're a fan of The Thing, Event Horizon, Alien, anything along those lines, you will *relish* the game's mixture of music, storytelling and pace. The fact that I've just finished my god-knows-how-many-th run through here in 2015 having thoroughly enjoyed every minute really underlines how well the devs did.The game does like it's share of jump scares but I found it didn't overdo them - rather than go down Doom 3's route of continuously letting loose horrors from hidden cabinets, half the time the game lets your own head do it's work for you - you'll glimpse things rushing down corridors, you'll hear whispers in the dark without any clear source, every so often something will clang and crash. It's classic horror stuff of messing with your head to make the reveal all the better. The game drip-feeds it's story by way of audio logs, footage, and gradual exposition across what used to be a place where it's crew worked and lived, as you slowly learn what the f*** happened on this doomed ship, and the excellent voice acting really pushes the script in the right direction. Technically, it's a fairly standard third-person shooter - much of the ruckus about how your character is an average blue-collar Parker-from-Alien engineer thrown into a nightmarish ghost ship crawling with horrific entities is fairly thin, as your 'improvised engineering tools' can be turned into shockingly devastating instruments of destruction (quite what a miner needs a giant particle cannon for is explained as, um, shooting rocks... yeah, makes you wonder how fast and ferocious rocks are in the future) but none of that is really important - expect a gameplay pace sitting somewhere between Mass Effect 1 and Gears of War with *very* rough narrative outline and atmosphere similar to System Shock 2. Intially playing like a Survival Horror, padding down corridors with a palpable feeling that you are only alive by sheer luck with precious little kit, the game steadily becomes more and more action-packed with Isaac the Engineer undergoing some serious nerd rage, upgrading his contraptions to fight ever more gross and numerous monsters that take leaves out of pretty much every sci-fi horror of the last 20 years.But don't play this for the simple gameplay, as entertaining as it is. Play it to enjoy a truly awesome sci-fi horror and wish that the gaming industry produced half as much as this stuff as it did CoD clones.Then play it's sequel. Like me. :D			"

												11 hours to play through the story on medium difficulty.Dead Space has a decent story & good atmosphere though it is more action than horror. About a third of the way in you become too powerful, save for a regenerating enemy, which reduces the tension further so it might be better to start on a harder difficulty. Controls are a bit awkward & the bosses are a little underwelming , still worth a playthrough.Also there's stomping zombie babies.			"

It's very linear, mostly go to point A do something, go to point B, etc. The jump scares are good but the very best moments are when you panic because you don't have enough ammo to kill everything and have to run to find ammo and/or get creative.Very recommended, 9/10			"

												Dead Space is a gem as in a horror/action game, and to give you an idea what it is like, is that it is a mixture of doom and resident evil. The story is creepy and well made and the gameplay is pretty good ( would have been perfect if the controls for pc was not werid and you can adjust the senseitifity of the gamepad) and the atmosphere is very strong for this one. To me this game is not super scary but it does has its moments like the faint singing of a woman singing twinkle twinkle little star in the backround on chapter 6 and 10. This game is also super gory, so if you have a weak stomach than good luck :). Some of the missions are annoying but worth it in the long run. Overall I give this game (in my opinon) a 8/10. Also look at the chapter names and write down each begining letter and you are in for a treat!			"

												One of my top ten games I've ever played.  This game has a compelling story, scary atmosphere, wonderful gameplay, the whole package.  I enjoy a challange, and this game provided on higher difficulties.  Limiting ammo and ways to eliminate threats just makes horror games that much more horrifying.  I never really ran out of ammo, but in my playthrough I always remained fairly low and had to purchase some on occasion and it just made me really focus on how I killed things and added a level of a depth to the gameplay.I played it on x-box, if it shows  <1 hour or something10/10			"

												Wonderfully immersive and exciting. A true horror thriller with a nice twist of 3rd person action.For a long time i had played the IOS version of Dead Space, and loved almost everything about it - the graphics, the style, the action, the jump scares... I could go on! However, it lacked immersion due to the touch controls and how itd take up most the screen controlling Issac.However, when i then saw that Humble Bundle was selling this along side DS2 & DS3, i was over the moon - finally i would be able to play my favourite franchise (depsite never having even played the PC versions). A year passed and i had yet to play the game on my PC (a HP Pavillion Intel Pentium laptop, i think you can understand why), so when i bought a PS3, i once again bought DS1&DS2.Now here is why i have brought all this up - the controls. The games graphics and gameplay is stunning, however it may take you a while to learn the auxilliary controls on keyboard. Whereas there are 16 buttons max on a PS3/4 Controller, there are 80+ keys on a keyboard, which are not always the easiest to reach from WASD, so when accessing the mission log, map or objectives, it can be a pain remembering which keys are which and stretching to reach them. Sure you could remap the keys, but then once again youd be having to learn them again.Otherwise, this game is stunning, with a thrilling story and plenty of jump scares, and a real sense of terror.

												This is a heartwarming game about a man named Isaac Clarke going to a large spaceship and finding himself. He interacts with many of the passengers on the ship and makes many friends. He even reuinites with his love, whom had joined the space station much sooner than he. This game teaches us the value of friendship and kindness and displays messages of love and tolerance throughout the story. Overall this game is just a superb work of art that captures the essence of what it is to be human and generally just uplifts your spirit the entire time. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you will fall in love with this touching tale.Also theres flesh eating monsters...			"

												I keep trying to play this game, but i can only seem to deal with the stress in the morning before work, and only 15 minutes-an hour at a time. The controls feel sluggish, but clearly in a way to excentuate the frustration this game is supposed to inspire. I wish this game was a bit shorter, which is an odd thing for me to say. I've played it about 8-10 hours and I'm ready to play Dead Space 2, which looks a lot better.I haven't run into any bugs. The music, sound and voice acting are great, and at least, I think the graphics were cutting edge when the game came out.Clearly, this game was made by talented sadists.

												Dead Space is one of my all-time favorites, and in a true sense a masterpiece. I bought and played it upon its original release, and it was pretty much bug free and stable out of the box, even if it pushed my trusty old Core2Duo I had then pretty hard.The design choices, story line (augmented by a couple of animated movies ,""Dead Space: Downfall"" and ""Dead Space: Aftermath""), atmosphere, and gritty industrial Sci-Fi environment, make this a memorable, terrifying, and unique experience. Think of it as an amalgamation of Aliens, Event Horizon, The Thing, and Pandorum. It does have some jump scares, but mainly all the adversaries are manageable, especially since you get to upgrade your gear throughout.You definitely get the feeling of being in space, in particularly due to the very, very awesome Zero-G sequences, and your requirement for Oxygen and the ability to magnetize your boots. This is pretty unique in games, and certainly was a novelty back when Dead Space was released. This is probably the fourth time I've bought the game, for one due to DRM-freeness, and because it's worth it. Of all the games published by EA over the years, the Dead Space (and Mass Effect) franchises are certainly one of the best games ever made.In fact, the only negative I have to say about Dead Space is the ridiculous control/button assignments. Being left handed I do not use WASD, I use the cursor, and surrounding keys, and Dead Space isn't very helpful there. I had to get a program called GlovePIE which I've had to use a few times since. Once setup though, everything works just fine.In conclusion, if you are a Sci-Fi/Horror fan, enjoy a good third person shooter style experience, and enjoy roaming around in beautiful, atmospheric environments, then this is for you! And remember: In space, no one can hear you scream!			"

 Originally posted on May 13, 2011 Event Horizon, Pandorum, Alien, even 2001. All of these films and many other great Sci Fi traditions act as a healthy source base for Dead Space. The game features a distress call, a seemingly silent ship which we quickly realize is dark and full of monsters. Something has gone terribly wrong.The game's carefully crafted atmosphere and surprisingly good voice acting are really what draw you in. Although the plot is very transparent, and the character development (especially for Kendra) is a little weak, the game isn't really about that. It's about living out some version of the space horror fantasy you've had in your head ever since the first time you saw say, Event Horizon. The game has it all, spooky lighting, creepy cultists, a wide array of frightening monsters, and a slowing unfolding backstory involving a typical breakdown of the chain of command and descent into chaos.Playing this game with headphones and in the dark, while alone, even a second time through, is quite an experience. Your heart will pound and you will jump out of your seat.Graphically speaking the game isn't much to look at, and the necromorphs aren't very inspired in their design, although they are scary. Nevertheless, the lighting and audio more than make up for the game's low resolution textures and low poly models.Apart from really wonky object physics, the game feels very good to play as well. The slow turning speed of Isaac, your avatar, contributes to the sense of the game as being about horror/survival, and scavenging is essential. You aren't incredibly vulnerable, especially after upgrades, but you feel like you are, and that's what counts.Ultimately, Dead Space is a surprising and fun guilty pleasure of a game that will remind you of nights spent watching sci-fi horror movies scaring yourself senseless in the dark.

												Going in for a fourth playthrough, this game is still an incredible gem. One of the greatest console ports I've played, one of my all-time favorite scifi horror pieces. Maybe it's not such a pure horror case in the way that Amnesia is but it sure blows Resident Evil games and such out of the water. Atmosphere and audio are incredible. Loud surround sound + vibrating gamepad + Ripper saw = glee! and gore. Concerned neighbours, maybe.Mandatory protip: Do NOT have Vsync on, it is bugged and will screw up your controls, making you think it's a sloppy console job. Other than that I've not found any technical flaws. Supposedly main menu's ""continue game"" can reset your difficulty to Normal, use ""load game"" instead.Protip #2: DO NOT PLAY ON ANYTHING LESS THAN HARD DIFFICULTY. You'll thank yourself later.  Easy/Normal is like playing with god mode. (Impossible difficulty is extra fun but it needs unlocking)The sequel has huge stompin' boots to fill.			"

												One of the best games of its time. This game snuck up on me one year after I had been playing Fallout 3 on Xbox 360 for a few months.  My friends rented a copy for the weekend and choose me to play the game.  They claimed it would scare me and shock me.  I just laughed and said ""whatever"".  Later after getting back we installed the game and started it.  After about 40 minutes, my firends had jumped about 13 times and i remained calm determined to dismember any in my path. By the end of my first playthrough I never once got scared.  I did however gain one of the most memorable stories from a game series. Your resault may vary though.9/10			"

												I enjoyed this game. It is scary... if dead bodies scare you. I mean, ..sure there are moments where I jumped a bit, but..scary is ..giving it too much credit. Perhaps how I played (as a paranoid person I shot all bodies, removed all corpses from rooms before fully entering them, had plenty of ammo at all times with all weapons, kept aware of all surroundings and exits, etc) maybe I killed the scary..but ...whatever. Its good. Good gameplay, good story, good characters, great environments. Even good puzzles / level design.What's wrong is that... its not scary, its just incredibly gore intensive. Its piles of flesh and blood here, constant disgusting dismemberment of reanimated alien dead things..and ...I was grossed out. Half the time I was supposed to be scared of something I was more worried how gross it was going to be to kill it. The game has some great moments though that are worth the money to experience. A good buy.			"

The story is slightly easy to guess (atleast it was for me) but that didnt prevent me from finishing it (may play it again soon too! :P).Yes, DeadSpace 1 (and 2!) support Eyefinity with +hoz. Infact I'd argue that the Deadspace series is my favorite eyefinity experience, I really enjoyed it THAT much.			"

												Dead Space, For starers if you're someone that gets freaked out easily by jump scares and creeped out by unsettling noises.. BUY THIS GAME :D lol.  I recommend you watch the anime first to get a sense of what the game may be like. If it peaks yours curiosity buy this game. I recommend to play with headphones and late at night! The game play is solid with a standard mission or objective to complete. Followed by enemy waves and boss fights. The story is pretty interesting and keeps your interested throughout the play though making you want to know what happens next.If you enjoy this game definitely look at Dead Space 2 and 3. Sadly 3 is on Origin. But is also co-op campaign and each persons experience is based on the character you play. So 2 plays might be a must if you want to see the game through a different lens. :)			"

You will simultaneously dread and relish turning each corner, and breathe a sigh of relief each time you discover a shop or save point.For added immersion, I played Dead Space in 3D with Nvidia 3D Vision, and it worked really well with this game. The smoky glare as the light from your plasma cutter disappears into the murky corridors makes you feel like you're looking through a window into a nightmare.			"

												I really enjoy this game. It does have very good textures even tho its from 2008. It also have a big amount of glitches. A lot of them related with the zero gravity jumps. Another one that cost me some googling was in the cryo room where you have to turn on vertical sync or asure you have under 100FPS average otherwise the scientist will fall from the ground and wont leave the room and you wont be able to fight the boss and go forward. Just turn it ON, wait for him to leave, turn it OFF. The only time i had to do that.Still a great game! I really enjoy hours playing this. An awesome atmospheric horror scy fi shooting game. I love this genre and i do recommend this title.			"

And I was right.It has all the right elements to making a good science fiction game: the lighting, a little bit of actual science thrown in for that hard sci-fi feel, the dirtiness of the environment, and of course, the creeping music.The game was so dark and intense I found I had to take a break a few times per chapter and psyche myself up before going back in.I heartily recommend this game for any fan of good, grungy science fiction and horror.

												there are 5 rule to play this game:1. Double Tap. Make sure your enemy has died. Stomp them 5 times (or more if needed).2. Don't run carelessly. Just walk slowly so you won't get a heart attack.3. Conserve your ammo. Aim his head (oh wait that doesnt work), ok then, aim his limb (wtf, you still not died yet?), Alright, shoot him with all you've got.4. Don't panic if you hear voice but you can't see the enemy. Alt+f4 is here for you buddy.5. Enjoy the game!!			"

												StorySci-fi horror with RPG elements, Dead Space provides a graphic experience aimed to induce fear as you make your way through hellish sections of a broken mining ship. Set on what's left of a large 'planet-cracker' ship named USG Ishamura. You play as Isaac Clarke, an engineer assigned to perform routine repairs of the Ishamura. Upon arrival you and your team soon learn there are much more concerning matters than rebooting engines and repairing downed communications. By working together with your remaining crew, you will uncover the truth behind the Ishamura's downfall and it's now necromorph staff, and struggle to avoid sharing the same fate.GameplayMovement and aiming controls felt cumbersome and clunky, like two bad dancers stepping on each others toes. Enemy AI behaved intelligently when ambushing and cornering, despite their predictable appearances and entrances. Dead Space's minimal HUD helps bring about a more immersive experience and interaction with objects and environments felt fluid. Abundance of items and gear dampens the horror aspect, but creates an enjoyable amount of gear customization and weapon variety. (For a more intense experience I'd recommend a harder difficulty) Nicely paced story and chapters that introduce new obstacles and enemy variants as the game progresses. Challenging yet rewarding.SoundEerie and grim, the music works well in adding to the gruesome nature of the game. Sound effects and necromorph screams/grunts are hair-raising, despite feeling amplified for cheap jump scares. Quality voice acting, though it's worth mentioning you (Isaac) play as a silent protagonist.GraphicsPlaying 8 years later it's impressive that these graphics don't show their age. Necromorphs are horrifically stunning in detail, as well as the games gorey environment. Lighting and textures appear believable and fitting for both the horror genre and sci-fi. Unlike movement and aiming, the graphics and sounds come together in a beautifully orchestrated ensemble of fear and sweet, sweet necromorph dismemberment.Replay ValueOffering NG+ it's hard to not revisit Ishamura for a round 2. Even after much exploring there still feels like Dead Space has a lot more to offer and likely grows in enjoyment each playthrough, giving it a strong replay value which I feel we can all agree on is a wonderful feature for any game.Wrapping UpOverall Dead Space offers a quality gaming experience, interesting story, detailed atmosphere, and nicely implemented scares. What few flaws you can find in the game are outshined by everything it does right.			"

												Horror probably isn't the right word here. The game doesn't really go for good scares, mostly just sudden ""oh my god it's an alien coming straight for you suddenly have a loud noise"" and they just got incredibly predictable after a while. But it can be quite creepy at times - probably helped absolutely humonguous amounts by the absolutely incredible sound design of this game. I think that this might the only time I max out one of the score categories for a game.Seriously, the sound design is just amazing. Incredible ambient noise, with really creepy nuances and fantastic utterly disgusting music for when you get under attack. Every single sound made is absolutely perfect.Also the UI of this game is just amazing. Everything makes sense in the game world, it's all projected out of your suit or from screens on everything. It's fantastic, and it helps increase the tension because you can't pause the game by opening the map screen/inventory screen.The gameplay is pretty good, though I didn't feel it got tough enough on Normal difficulty so perhaps Hard difficulty is the right difficulty to play it on. The weapons are all satisfying to use, and can be very effective when upgraded correctly. I liked the way most of the enemies had weak points you could exploit to kill them quicker and conserve more ammo. The design of the aliens was fantastic, and the ship design was quite good (I liked how you had to revisit some levels for good reason, and some things had changed and that actually made it slightly creepy and foreboding).The story wasn't particularly impressive, but a few bits of it were quite good. I was quite disappointed by the very end of the game though, like literally the last few seconds [if you've played it you'll know what I mean] because it just felt incredibly cheap.Other than that, this game was very good. A definite play, if not for the perfectly adequate gameplay then just for the mindblowingly incredible sound. Seriously, someone give the guy who did all that all the awards. Ever. All the awards.

I have played the first hour of this game 3 times now, and I still haven't found the courage to continue. I am a zombie fanatic, I love TWD, L4D2, even the dead islands will suffice.

												Great game to play if you love survival horror games. If you haven't played the sequels or watched the movies, play this for a couple hours and you'll see just how dark this game's can become. There's also plenty of collectibles to find. Some are video or audio logs, however most of it is text logs. Now while that may be a huge turnoff for some, you don't need those logs to know what's happening. The logs are there to provide some more details on what's happening as well as giving some background information. The combat system in this game is pretty unique, too. The Necromorphs which are like space zombies need to be killed by severing their limbs. Shooting them in the head however won't work Anyway it's been awhile since I played it on my Xbox One and I've forgotten how the story goes at some parts, but what I can tell you is that this game is worth the buy. Especially if you're reading this during the winter 2016 sale. $5 for a 2008 AAA title. Pretty damn good price. Same for DS2 (also on sale). 3 on the other hand isn't great.			"

												This game is right around 7 years old now, but I am just now playing for the first time, and boy do I love it. The combat is not anything special and is a little slow paced, but that really isn't anything to complain about. The game looks damn good considering how old it is, but the best part about the game is the story. I really like the setting and atmosphere of the game. I enjoy finding the audio/video logs that explain the lore even further. The game does a good job pacing itself and I am always intrigued to find out what will happen next to the characters and how it will turn out in the end. The game itself really isn't all that scary, just with some cheap jumpscares and all, but is rather creepy and eerie. I think this is one of the best horror games in the past decade.The actual port of the game is decent. After the Vsync change that fixed a gamebreaking bug the game plays just fine. I personally use a wired 360 controller because I just wasn't a fan of the default key layout and did't want to deal with the mouse sensitivity/acceleration problems. Other than those 2 issues I have had no other problems.I give Dead Space a solid 9/10			"

												I really enjoy this game. It does have very good textures even tho its from 2008. It also have a big amount of glitches. A lot of them related with the zero gravity jumps. Another one that cost me some googling was in the cryo room where you have to turn on vertical sync or asure you have under 100FPS average otherwise the scientist will fall from the ground and wont leave the room and you wont be able to fight the boss and go forward. Just turn it ON, wait for him to leave, turn it OFF. The only time i had to do that.Still a great game! I really enjoy hours playing this. An awesome atmospheric horror scy fi shooting game. I love this genre and i do recommend this title.			"

												Got to curb stomp an alien zombie baby. 10/10 would curbstomp again.But in all seriousness, I was on the hype train for this game when it first released in 2008. Spent hours watching trailers and gameplay videos before it finally released and it did not disappoint in the slightest. It made its way as one of the most memorable games to date for me. The atmosphere of the broken down ship, the suspended jump scares, the claustrophobia, the enemies and the intuitive design of attaching your health bar to your back to fully immerse you in this experience was done flawlessly. I may be a little biased but i am with good reason. Its a great game.			"

												there are 5 rule to play this game:1. Double Tap. Make sure your enemy has died. Stomp them 5 times (or more if needed).2. Don't run carelessly. Just walk slowly so you won't get a heart attack.3. Conserve your ammo. Aim his head (oh wait that doesnt work), ok then, aim his limb (wtf, you still not died yet?), Alright, shoot him with all you've got.4. Don't panic if you hear voice but you can't see the enemy.

												This game is the best of both the horror and action genre. It mixes so many good elements to scare you through suspense, jump scares, gore, fear and the big broader threat that everyone could die if you aren’t successful. Dead Space has set the standard for Sci-Fi Survival/Horror and its name stills sends shivers down the backs of gamers almost a decade later. The game starts with you, Isaac Clark, with a maintenance crew attending to the distress call on the U.S.G. Ishimura; a massive mining ship. Things go south quickly as the ship crashed into the main hanger and the crew is nowhere to be found. Throughout your struggle to restore functions to the ship and find out what happened you have constant deadly problems to deal with. This game is very original in the way the threats develop and you deal with them. There are sequences where you have to solve zero-g puzzles, mazes in zero-g, fight enemies with unique abilities, time very careful threats from the decaying ship and use the full range of your abilities. The game has 12 chapters, which you can finish in about an hour each making it great to set down with natural pauses. The game has upgrades from the stores found around the ships and you need to balance your credits and upgrade pick-ups with your need for ammunition and health throughout the game. One of my personal favorite mechanics in this game has to do with the soundtrack changing from the ambience to combat music. Most games start combat music when you enter a room or an enemy spawns. In Dead Space, with the exception of cut scenes, the combat music doesn’t start until you almost make eye contact with an enemy. This makes it terrifying when that one enemy that you missed comes up behind you and grabs you suddenly out of the nice ambient space music. There are also many sequences when you are in the vacuum of space and the game lets you only hear one sound, Isaac’s breathing. Unless you see the enemy coming, he’ll be behind you. The most immersive aspect of the game is the face that there is really no HUD. Your health is displayed as a series of bars on the back of Isaac’s armor and when looking at your inventory he projects the screen from his armor rather than the game opening a menu. Overall, the game is a wonderful, immersive sci-fi survival/horror game that has really set the bar for its unique niche. I would highly recommend it and play it in a dark room with headphones all the way up in the dead of night.			"

												Been a while since I completed this game, but I would definitcounmmend this to anyone looking for a Sci-fi Horror game with Survival elements. At its core, it's a third-person shooter that has you playing as Isaac Clarke, an engineer stuck on a doomed mining ship, struggling to find a way out while uncovering the secrets of the former crew and the cause of the outbreak. The backstory is the real star here. It's told through audio recordings, notes and letters by former crew members and survivors. The main story itself is serviceable, but has quite a few horror film clichés and tropes. Lots of plot devices are often recycled to keep the game going. For example, half the chapters consist of fixing something that has broken down somewhere in the ship for whatever reason.The gameplay itself is quite satisfying and provides a fair challenge that rarely feels frustrating or unfair. All weapons function differently from each other and give certain advantages and disadvantages. The crafting system isn't anything special, but it's not bad at all. As far being ""scary"", it's a pretty mixed bag. If predictable jump scares are your thing, then you will be scared most of the time. However, there is a psychological horror aspect to this game that the sequels never quite replicated. A lot of events are never actually seen or experienced, but rather heard or found after they've taken place. Some of them are quite startling and adds a sense of impending doom to your journey. Disembodied voices (if listened to carefully, may imply it's actually just Issac going insane) also add to this layer of fear. My biggest problem with the gameplay is that the mouse controls are unresponsive or too sensitive at times, but there are several   community guides to fixing this. Overall a solid 8/10 game for me.			"

												A game that is visually great, neat monsters, more of the scary fps type of game more so than the bullets-blazing type of game, but sadly thrown together with a horrible control and aiming system, cramped cropped 3rd person over the shoulder shooting that restricts line of sight and correct tactics and aiming, and together you have a beautiful game that might have been great but sadly has none of the controls or abilities that most shooter type games similar to this have. All flash, no bang. Its well worth the price to get it on sale to see if you can stomach the controls enough to play it a while, some do, some don't. Dead Space 2 i hear fixes this problem but you do have it in dead space. I recommend the game since it a good price on sale, but sadly i got bored with the bad controls and fov very quick and didn't even feel like trogging through more of the same for a half dozen more chapters. Bad controls will turn me off a game very quick.			"

												I can't say enough about this game (or its sequel). Very few games have achieved the genuine suspense and atmosphere that it has. Although it relies a lot on jump-scares, the overarching, pervasive feeling of danger is effectively evoked and present throughout the entire game; unlike most horror films and games, it does not rely on the player/character to make stupid decisions to perpetuate its air of chilling anticipation. The combat actually requires a decent amount of skill, and if you're playing on a harder difficulty, the game *does* live up to the ""survival"" part of the genre. The enemies are interestingly not the lone source of the scare either; the environment and its hazards play just as big a role in it.All in all, I can easily say that Dead Space is my favorite game of all time. It does such justice to the survival-horror genre that I believe it should set an example for what other titles in it should aim for.			"

												While catagorized as horror its scares rely on keeping you on edge with both jump scares and health-kit/ammo shortages. The controls are a bit stiff and there is an intentianal delay in some actions, but rather than being broken it instead makes you feel immersed. You are an engineer in the game, not the doom guy. You aren't trained for combat and you weren't expecting any of this to happen. Your weapons are your literal working tools and you're just trying to get the hell out of dodge alive. There are certain points in the game were you can die in a scripted sequence very easily and the mini cutscene can drag on forever, especially for the final boss. 7/10 no replay value really.			"

												Amazing game. I remember back in 2009, I played this with my best friend on xbox live. We'd play the same chapters as we would talk and I couldn't stop playing. I believe we beat it that same night. 10/10			"

												I've heard good or bad things about this, in my opinion though this is a very ingenious little survival horror that actually manages to deliver plain out startling as well as subtle scares, the feature to re-visit areas that you had already been to, in later chapters, and find actual changes there and to virtually go anywhere on the spaceship that you're on made this a quite unique experience. It's also immersive, due to how ingame inventory system and other info screens are implemented, and the combat is frightening as well as fun. For something that EA has published, this is actually very good in my opinion.			"

												For those looking for a game from one of the BEST years in gaming, look no further. Dead Space pits you in place where both fear and paranoia may become your best allies. Dead Space is the first of three games in the main series with two spin-off games, several novels, and a few animated movies. The story pits you in the midst of a communications blackout on a massive mining ship and  you're an engineer stuck inside the infested ship that hordes a morbid secret. You and the other survivors of a ship responing to a distress signal must now find a way of the mining ship before being consumed by the nightmares that reside within.This is no ordinary jumpscare thrills shooter as the encounters with the enemies in combat can be just as terrifying as the jumpscares placed by the devs. This game will test your will and the harder the difficulty the more you will gasp for air.

												Probably my FAVE fps series of all time... or a pretty damn close tie. Dead Space is a BEAUTIFULLY made Horror FPS like no other. The series is packed full of gore, excitement, thrills and twists that will leave you to find yourself letting that pizza you just ordered get cold as you lean closer and closer towards your screen getting sucked into the nightmare that is Dead Space.The game takes place where the Animation Movie leaves off, and it has a wonderfully executed story line that will grasp your attention and interest. The cutscene are awesome and the death scene are even more spectacular. If you happen to play this game it is at least worth dying once and sometimes twice to every enemy type as the cinematic death cutscenes definitely go unrivalled. The game is also inredibly fun playing it multiple ways. My personal favorite is to beat it on hardest difficulty with only the starting plasma cutter. I have completed 1,2 on hardest that way and 51.4% through 3 on impossible which is ludacris and might very well be close to impossible if not impossible. Either way, AMAZING SERIESS11/10 MUST BUY			"

												I never write reviews.But this game deserves one. Out of all the games in the Dead Space series, this one, in my opinion, is the scariest BY FAR.I do not find any other setting for a horror game more suitable than a derelict space craft drifting in space, knowing that YOU have no allies!10/10 would crap my pants again like I did in 2008.

												The game itself is fantastic. Great graphics, atmosphere, and gameplay. However, it has some annoying ""console port' issues. There's two showstopping bugs. One happens in the first 5 minutes of the game, the other in the last 5. First bug is a door that has an invisible wall inside of it and won't let you go through. The 2nd bug is a crash to desktop when opening a door. Both can be bypassed by temporarily turning on v-synch. You'll want to keep the in-game v-synch off most of the time because otherwise you get locked to 30 FPS..I also recommend capping the game at 60 FPS using something like dxtory, otherwise there's some weird physics bugs. They don't impact the gameplay, but I saw a bunch of corpses that should have been stationary wildly twirling in the air. It was as comical as it sounds. All these bugs are realted to the fact that in the late 2000s developers had this habit of tying various scripting and physics math to the in-game FPS.  I assume this was done because the console version was locked to a certain, and consistent FPS. However when you're getting above 60 FPS on a PC, things start to wig out. If you notice anything weird happening, that's likely why. I also had an issue where I would instantly die while doing some of the zero-g sections. It would happen when flying between surfaces. Sometimes when landing on a surface at an awkward angle, my game would freeze for a moment and then play a death animation. Not sure if that last one is an issue with the game itself, or due to the some of the fixes I was using to improve other parts of the experience.Highly reccomend the game as it is worth playing. There aren't really any other huge issues with the port, but I thought the two issues I described were big enough to warrant mention and criticism. Check out: http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Dead_Space for some additional tweaks and fixes. I found the FOV adjust and the ""mouse fix"" pretty handy.			"

												Awesome game. I wasn't really sure what to think of it when I bought it shortly after it came out. This series has become one of my all time video game favorites, and I have been playing video games for almost 25 years now.Tips to enjoy:1.) Turn out lights.2.) Play at night.3.) Be the only one home and expose your back to a large dark room.4.) Get headphones with surround sound5.) Enjoy peeing in your pants and jumping at shadows.Seriously, this game is morbid, dark, twisted, and tons of fun. I keep going back for more.The game may be old (2008ish), but is still lots of fun. Everything is done in 3rd person. This mean all interfaces, inventory screen, video/audio/text logs, maps, etc are shown in 3rd person at anytime where you can be attacked from mosters. The controls may seem unresponsive at first but it quickly adds to the game machanics and atmosphere and don't really become a burden. The lighting and sound design is spot on. That is where this game really, really shines. This game may not have the greatest graphics, but you couldn't ask for better lighting placement or sound effects. The game does mix things up and it never overuses a game concept which does add for atleast a second playthrough. Each enviroment feels different yet somehow familiar but you never get that feeling of ""been there, done that.""  The dismemberment mechanic (where the best way to kill something is to shoot its limbs off), the 3rd person everything, the lighting and sound design, the level design, the ""Zero G' and vacuum machanic, the pacing of the game, and the general atmosphere of the game makes it unique and one not to be missed. This is one that you will remember for several years and probably pick up to play after a couple years and still find it fun.This game is NOT to be missed.			"

ATTENTION ALL AMD USERS*TO ALL AMD USERS, THIS GAME WILL NOT RUN ON YOUR CARD NOR BE PROPERLY ENJOYABLE UNLESS YOU FOLLOW THESE SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS*Step 1: Click on this link, trust me, it will take you to a very important Steam guide that will help you prevent this game from crashing before it even starts - 


Running Dead Space on an AMD GPU 
A Guide for Dead Space
By: Hootie

			 Framerate slowdown? Mouse acceleration and sensitivity issues? The invisible door bug?  The port for Dead Space 1 isn't perfect, and nigh unplayable on some machines.		


 Follow those instructions specifically as it says AND, then after that restart your computer. Trust me, it doesn't kick in until you restart your PCStep 2: Also Click on this link, again, it's another Steam Guide but this one helps to fix the terribly low and awful mouse controls that the game has on default, trust me, its a very serious issue - 


How to fix mouse control problems 
A Guide for Dead Space
By: Bropalm

			Here's how you can fix all problems with the mouse controls by editing the game's config file.		


Step 3: There's no step 3 because that number is not in the Steam text unicode of this user review client...jk moving on, MAKE SURE TO TURN OFF V-SYNCStep 4: *SPOILERS BUT I NEED TO TELL YOU* So there's a part in the very beginning of the game where you are going to come across what is infamously known as the ""Invisible-Wall-Bug-Of-The-Dead-Space-PC-Port"". This invisible wall bug is found right in the beginning of the game in the first chapter where you first recieve the plasma cutter right after you exit the elevator unarmed from the slasher necromorphs chasing you. This room has a wall that says ""cut off the limbs"" and has a guy screaming behind a door, if you were to continue your journey that exact door that dude is behind will not let you pass, seriously, it's a stupid glitch but theres many stupid glitches in this game that shouldn't be in there. So this is what you are going to do, I recommend you save your game before hand in the first save station to do this. Once you reach the first elevator and you are in it quickly go to your options menu and turn on V-Sync, you may have to deal with terrible framerate and mouse controls but once you make it pass that door you can turn it off and continue your survival through the USG Ishimura. (If this doesn't work then try to find a way to decrease your framerate under 30 fps, the game is capped at 30 anyway, I heard Fraps helps with this under the same process I specified).Soooo yeah, now that that's out of the way, lets get on to the review shall we?ReviewSo excluding the atrocious PC port Dead Space is a fantastic and immersive horror experience. Now I got to be frank with you, I pretty much spoiled Dead Space when I saw a let's play from like 3-5 years ago yet my memory was very vague when I played this game. To tell you what's going on in the story I recommend you play it for yourself because duh spoilers, that plus other people who give reviews will tell tend to explain the story, mine is more of the experience.Besides spoiling the game for myself I have also played Dead Space 2 and completed it (On the Xbox 360) and have got to say that the experience was very unique compared to if I played Dead Space 1 first and then 2. You know that feeling when you look at a picture of a famous monument and actually went there? Or go and experience that one place that's so talked about and then actually visit it? Well that's what Dead Space 1 was like when I played it, so much of the trilogy's plot all revolves around the events of what happened on the USG Ishimura and the planet Aegis 7 along with the developement of the main protagonist Isaac Clarke, that plus the event's of the USG Ishimura acts as a catalyst for pretty much the entire 3 game's story.As a survival horror game Dead Space does it pretty well even though the gameplay mechanics are straight up Resident Evil 4 just with new stuff that you can do. Now yes as much of the Dead Space community has stated Dead Space 1 is a lot more scarier than is Dead Space 2 for many reasons. Now I'm pretty tough when it comes to scary games yet Dead Space still tends to frighten me compared to the jump scare infested and cinematic sequel that was Dead Space 2. The game kept my heart at an above than normal pulse in certain parts and some parts have truly made my heart race.The Immersion in Dead Space is incredible with the sound design being spot on along with the game's mechanics and setting working together to make the immersive experience amazing, here's how it works: Dead Space's indicators is all attached to the character's body such as the character's ""RIG"" stating the player's health along with the Stasis meter being on the character's RIG aswell, The game's mechanics such as the Stasis ability and Kinesis ability are all integrated uses in the game's setting, story, and lore, not some thing tacked on for just gameplay purposes. For example the use of stasis and kinesis are actual tools used by the USG Ishimura's crew along with the weapons of the game being mechanical power tools used on the ship (excluding the Pulse Rifle of course). The sound design is spot on and it all makes sense and adds to the game, you will hear distant screams of unlucky survivors and necromophs alike that will make you wonder if there were any other survivors still on the ship through out your journey, you will hear clanks and sounds in the vents and in the distance that make you tense thinking that a necromorph can come out of any vent at any time possible.Dead Space's story is very interesting and many of the concept's of the game are ones that I have never seen in anything before, sure the game take's influences from franchises such as Alien along with how the premise of the game has already been done by titles such as System Shock 2. Besides that I think the game is very original for its time and I think anyone should do some research on the lore because the setting of Dead Space with planet cracking, the Marker, necromorphs and the Church of Unitology is one that I find interesting.The Bad n' UgryThe port for Dead Space on PC is atrocious, not for the fact that it has issues but by the fact that it's bugs are absolutely pathetic, like really, some of the bugs in this game make Call of Duty: Ghost's PC port look good, I mean here's a list of the bugs that I've encountered:1. The game doesn't even try to run on AMD alone 2. Stupid invisible door glitch in the beginning3. Broken physics and highly sensitive hitboxs for non-static objects that cause things such as corpes and dead body parts to flail around when you give a slight love tap to them (chapter 2 body bag dance party lel)4. Player model/Isaac Clarke tends to spaz out when you sprint on some parts of the ground5. Finicky mouse controls with horribly low sensitivity even on the highest setting6. Some wierd thing that happens to a tram door that gets stuck mid animation that causes you from passing7. Characters that die tend to spaz out when they go from static character to ragdoll (hilarious and somewhat immersive breaking)8. (MY ABSOLUTE HATED) So there will be parts where you will have to float in space and there is a slight chance that your character make freeze via clipping into geometry and just die as if Isaac sufficated from I don't know, polygons? This happened to me like 3 times and 2 were by the end of the gameBut hey that doesn't mean it's a bad game! So go out and buy it and have a good ol' time!			"

 ""Make us whole, Isaac. Make us whole."" TL;DR: Play as Isaac Clarke, the unluckiest son of a ♥♥♥♥♥(literally) engineer in video gaming history ever. Be haunted by a mysterious artefact that is somehow the key to stopping aliens(but still wants to kill you because plot holes).Dead Space is supposedly a survival horror TPS game. While I personally don't think this game as a good horror game, it at least attempts(and sometimes succeeds), which is much more better then Dead Space 3(that game didn't even try).This is what the game is about: you are part of a repair team, heading towards the USG Ishmura, the biggest 'Planet Cracker' in the universe. It sent out a distress call and lost connection, so you, as the engineer(you're accompanied by Kendra, a hacker, and Zach Hammond, a security officer, and his team), is to fix up Ishmura(and your ship as well, the USG Kelion) and find the source of the call. Of course, everything goes south when in the first 30 minutes, you become haunted by the 'Necromorphs', mysterious, grotesque and dangerous humanoid creatures that quickly panics the entire team. Now, since you're the only one able to do anything(because game protagonist logic), you have to find out what the ♥♥♥♥ happened here.The game is kinda like what everyone calls it: Resident Evil in space. After all, the developers based the gameplay off of Resident Evil because they didn't have much time for development. Though there are very unique gameplay features in Dead Space.The game doesn't have a HUD(Heads Up Display). Your health is represented by your RIG, the Resource Integration Gear. Everyone has one of these in the future- it a computer device(looks like a mechanical spine) that you attach on your back. Since this is a TPS, you can see your RIG most of the time, and as your health goes down, the bar on your RIG gets low(like how health bars get low), and it changes color to blue to yellow to red.This game also has a inventory and a store system, so you press tab to see your inventory. When you press tab, your suit(you wear a engineering/or a mining suit that makes you look like a  badass [images1.wikia.nocookie.net]) will display a hologram inventory screen in front of you. It fits in with the SF feel of the game, and is much more immersive then a generic HUD. Your ammo will also be displayed when you aim, much like Halo, though your number of clips is not displayed, so you have to check your inventory.You will find money inside crates and corpses of Necromorphs, which can be used at the store to buy ammo, health packs, etc. You will also find schematics for new items so you can just install it at the store and buy it. New suit schematic are important as they increase your armor and inventory size. You will also find 'Power Nodes' to open 'Node Rooms', which has very good things like much needed ammo on higher difficulties, and most important of all, new schematics(there are only one schematic for one item, so if you miss that schematic, it's gone for good).You can also go to the Bench and upgrade your RIG(armor, health, air, etc), weapons, your Stasis Module which slows down enemies and objects, and your Kinesis Module which picks up heavy objects without a use of ammo- very important in higher difficulties. You upgrade them with Power Nodes, so be careful- you never know if you'll find a Node Room right after you spend all of your Nodes on upgrades.There are also good variety of weapons, though the first free weapon you get, the Plasma Cutter, is very versatile and is good at everything(it's basically the best weapon in the game. you never want to sell it) As you can see from the name, it cuts things. It's a tool for cutting rocks, but in this game, it's used to cut off limbs. Why? Because headshots or bodyshots doesn't work for these monsters. You have to make them useless by cutting off their limbs. They don't die just from headshots(though they do lose their vision), and their torso is made out of ♥♥♥♥ing metal or something.So we know the gameplay is at least something, so move on to the story- it actually has a very deep world(that you get to know more about in the second game), and the story intrigues you right from the start. The atmosphere and the story in general is heavily inspired by a 1997 movie 'Event Horizon'. The box cover for the game(a hand floating in space) is a homage to a scene in the movie, actually.(the more you know) It has that general feel of 'what the ♥♥♥♥ happened here' like in Half-Life or Bioshock(this game probably did the best job on that), and finding out the mystery by checking out all of the text logs is pretty fun. The dispute between Kendra and Zach(Kendra says 'let's get the ♥♥♥♥ out of here', while Zach says 'We still have a mission') also seemed to be pretty good, though it stops right after Kendra disappears, then she comes back then Zach disappears.Oh, and Isaac- you just gotta ♥♥♥♥ing feel for him. He doesn't talk(he does in the later games), but he just does all of these things, and everytime he screams of fear(his 'AHHHHRG!!' is very memorable in some death scenes), you can't but say ""dude... this is ♥♥♥♥ed up."". And oh yeah, the death scenes in this game is notorious for being grotesque(much like the rest of the game), and it's true. It's the only thing all of the fans have praised throughout the series(the later games adds even more).Let's take a look at some of the other miscellaneous things though- the graphics are not dated. It's good enough, and the gore is like I said, great(though I don't know if it's a good thing or not). The soundtrack is very similar to Half-Life's case. It's mostly ambient tracks, which makes the atmosphere a lot better, but lot less memorable.So we narrowed down Dead Space, and is it a good game? Yes, it is. It's a great game in fact- and you can tell from all of what I said earlier. Though it still has its cons.The controls. The game's notorious for having terrible mouse controls, while it gets better in the later games, and gets better in this game as well if you tweak some of the files, the fact that they haven't released a official patch on Steam makes me feel pain inside. The difficulty is also a problem. If you get used to it(and you will), it's really really easy. If you watch  Jesse Cox's   blind Dead Space playthough , he plays it on Medium and does not die a single time(and he's known to suck at bideo gems). The boss fights are especially bad- you just shoot at the yellow balls and poof, you win. Every. ♥♥♥♥ing. Boss.Also, the 'survival horror' part is very subjective- the game does a good job of jumpscares in fact. They pop out of the vents and sometimes sneaks up on you, etc. They even play dead sometimes. But all of the monster spawns are scripted, so if you know where they'll spawn(or if you played 70 ♥♥♥♥ing hours like me), it's not that scary at all anymore. The atmosphere still might still spook you, though many people have said that they are not even scared of that anymore. Dead Space 2 and 3 leaves the whole 'closed down environment' atmosphere behind(well, maybe not Dead Space 3), but Dead Space 2 has other things to scare you(spoilers!).Except for that, there isn't much to say. I give Dead Space a 8/10, it's a great game. The execution is near perfect, though the minor gameplay issues and the bugs ruins it a bit. The storyline is still great though, and since it is even more expanded in the later games, I highly recommend you to buy Dead Space 2 and 3 as well. In my opinion(that I will explain in the Dead Space 2 review), Dead Space 2 is gamelay-wise better, and while Dead Space 3 was a huge disappointment, it's still a good game and you should try it out.

												Despite being a fairly buggy console port, Dead Space is a really decent game. It's strengths lie in it's atmosphere and immersion, which are only hampered slightly by a convoluted and, at times, slightly unclear plot.Gameplay is solid, especially the zero-g set pieces. Definitely worth buying in a sale, just be prepared to google the bugs and turn the V-sync off in game and force it on via your vcards control panel. Once you get it running ok it's a joy to play.

												Ah yes, Dead Space.This is one of my favorite series of all time, and if you decide to purchase this game, I think you may just find out why. Isaac Clarke is a futuristic engineer who is sent on a simple mission to repair a Planet Cracker vessel called the Ishimura. After a faulty landing, the crew finds themselves stuck on this ship, and the terrors ensue. This game set the base for survival horror when it first came out, and for good reason too. You will be on the edge of your seat with this one, and in the blink of an eye, flying into the back of it as well. I reccomend this game to all zombie loving survival horror gamers looking for an ingenious space age twist.			"

												This game is a wonderful addition to anyone's horror library.  Dead Space brings a truly gruesome and unsettling atmosphere into humanity's near future, and provides an experience which at times makes you suck in your gut in fear of death, and at other times makes you feel at home as you stare into the quiet peace of space.  The third person over-the-shoulder gameplay style is similar to that of Resident Evil 4 and 5, leaving Isaac as a relatively slow but powerful tank with the ability to run when he needs to escape certain death.  It is a game that will make you question what the ""right"" decision is as you unravel more of the games dark story which is driven by conspiracy, betrayal, and mental insanity.  I definitely recommend it to lovers of survival horror games, as well as those who enjoy third person shooters and would like something different than your average run 'n gun.			"

												Dead Space: Succeeds where many other survival horror games fail. This game is brutal, bloody, and as hard as asteroid debris. Pros: + Gore. You get a sense of dread in your stomach watching severed body segments float in zero gravity.+ Challenging. You will die several times. Several times. You really have to want to beat this game to get to the end.+ Long. It took me more than 17 hours to get through this game on medium, and that's pretty impressive for a game of this type.+ Stage design is immaculate. Your objectives in each section are varied, tie in nicely with the story, and the game looks great on a nice rig.+ The “Ripper” weapon is pure, unbridled joy. Cons:- The load screen makes you wait. If you try to minimize the screen and go do something else, it will still make you wait when you pull it back up. At least a third of the time you play this game you will be staring at the load screen. Ah, so this is how they meant to artificially extend playtime.- Frustrating controls and camera angles. Why must I watch from his shoulder like a parrot? Oh, you didn't mean to hit that button? Sucks to be you. Hope you like staring at load screens.- The protagonist is mute. When he gets ripped to shreds by Necromorphs, it's gross, but I feel no sense of connection to the hero.- The asteroid-shooting mini-game is pure tedium. Pro/Cons:+/- The upgrade system is appreciated, but the changes you make to your gear don't always seem that significant. +/- There is no cooperative mode, but then being the only person accomplishing tasks ramps up the tension. +/- Objectives can be vague and will make you consult online guides, but then, this game doesn't always hold your hand. The stages aren't as linear as they are in the 2nd and 3rd installments, where you're carted along one path like a theme park ride. Summary: This game is more than just Resident Evil in space. “Dead Space” does survival horror better. There is just a perfect amount of ammunition and supplies to keep you on the edge of your seat, amazing sequences, machines, and scenery, and it doesn't blatantly coddle the player. It qualifies as a classic. Who should buy this game:*Mature gamers that want a real survival horror challenge. *Horror aficionados who feel that most games aren't gory enough. Who should avoid this game:*Gamers who want something to play with friends.*Squeamish people that are upset by monstrous sounds, blood, and dead bodies. I give it an 8.9 out of 10.			"

												Awesome game. I wasn't really sure what to think of it when I bought it shortly after it came out. This series has become one of my all time video game favorites, and I have been playing video games for almost 25 years now.Tips to enjoy:1.) Turn out lights.2.) Play at night.3.) Be the only one home and expose your back to a large dark room.4.) Get headphones with surround sound5.) Enjoy peeing in your pants and jumping at shadows.Seriously, this game is morbid, dark, twisted, and tons of fun. I keep going back for more.The game may be old (2008ish), but is still lots of fun. Everything is done in 3rd person. This mean all interfaces, inventory screen, video/audio/text logs, maps, etc are shown in 3rd person at anytime where you can be attacked from mosters. The controls may seem unresponsive at first but it quickly adds to the game machanics and atmosphere and don't really become a burden. The lighting and sound design is spot on. That is where this game really, really shines. This game may not have the greatest graphics, but you couldn't ask for better lighting placement or sound effects. The game does mix things up and it never overuses a game concept which does add for atleast a second playthrough. Each enviroment feels different yet somehow familiar but you never get that feeling of ""been there, done that.""  The dismemberment mechanic (where the best way to kill something is to shoot its limbs off), the 3rd person everything, the lighting and sound design, the level design, the ""Zero G' and vacuum machanic, the pacing of the game, and the general atmosphere of the game makes it unique and one not to be missed. This is one that you will remember for several years and probably pick up to play after a couple years and still find it fun.This game is NOT to be missed.			"

												The game itself is fantastic. Great graphics, atmosphere, and gameplay. However, it has some annoying ""console port' issues. There's two showstopping bugs. One happens in the first 5 minutes of the game, the other in the last 5. First bug is a door that has an invisible wall inside of it and won't let you go through. The 2nd bug is a crash to desktop when opening a door. Both can be bypassed by temporarily turning on v-synch. You'll want to keep the in-game v-synch off most of the time because otherwise you get locked to 30 FPS..I also recommend capping the game at 60 FPS using something like dxtory, otherwise there's some weird physics bugs. They don't impact the gameplay, but I saw a bunch of corpses that should have been stationary wildly twirling in the air. It was as comical as it sounds. All these bugs are realted to the fact that in the late 2000s developers had this habit of tying various scripting and physics math to the in-game FPS.  I assume this was done because the console version was locked to a certain, and consistent FPS. However when you're getting above 60 FPS on a PC, things start to wig out. If you notice anything weird happening, that's likely why. I also had an issue where I would instantly die while doing some of the zero-g sections. It would happen when flying between surfaces. Sometimes when landing on a surface at an awkward angle, my game would freeze for a moment and then play a death animation. Not sure if that last one is an issue with the game itself, or due to the some of the fixes I was using to improve other parts of the experience.Highly reccomend the game as it is worth playing. There aren't really any other huge issues with the port, but I thought the two issues I described were big enough to warrant mention and criticism. Check out: http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Dead_Space for some additional tweaks and fixes. I found the FOV adjust and the ""mouse fix"" pretty handy.			"

												For those looking for a game from one of the BEST years in gaming, look no further. Dead Space pits you in place where both fear and paranoia may become your best allies. Dead Space is the first of three games in the main series with two spin-off games, several novels, and a few animated movies. The story pits you in the midst of a communications blackout on a massive mining ship and  you're an engineer stuck inside the infested ship that hordes a morbid secret. You and the other survivors of a ship responing to a distress signal must now find a way of the mining ship before being consumed by the nightmares that reside within.This is no ordinary jumpscare thrills shooter as the encounters with the enemies in combat can be just as terrifying as the jumpscares placed by the devs. This game will test your will and the harder the difficulty the more you will gasp for air.

												Dead Space: Succeeds where many other survival horror games fail. This game is brutal, bloody, and as hard as asteroid debris. Pros: + Gore. You get a sense of dread in your stomach watching severed body segments float in zero gravity.+ Challenging. You will die several times. Several times. You really have to want to beat this game to get to the end.+ Long. It took me more than 17 hours to get through this game on medium, and that's pretty impressive for a game of this type.+ Stage design is immaculate. Your objectives in each section are varied, tie in nicely with the story, and the game looks great on a nice rig.+ The “Ripper” weapon is pure, unbridled joy. Cons:- The load screen makes you wait. If you try to minimize the screen and go do something else, it will still make you wait when you pull it back up. At least a third of the time you play this game you will be staring at the load screen. Ah, so this is how they meant to artificially extend playtime.- Frustrating controls and camera angles.

												Dead Space is a third person, linear story-drivien, single player horror game. Gameplay focuses on third person shooting with some light puzzel solving.Oh, Dead Space, why did I wait so long to play you? This title has been in my backlog since 2010. I can't believe it took this long for me to play it, but I'm glad I finally did. The graphics hold up and in many cases still look amazing, but the real draw here is the ambiance. EA redwood Shores completely nails the derelict spaceship atmosphere. I'd like to put the sound design on a pedestal here as well. The 5.1 surround sound mix will instill a deep paranoia within you, making your walks through the ship extremely tense. Another stand out here is the HUD, or lack thereof. All the elements of a traditional HUD you would find in another game are here, but they are cleverly presented in a fashion (mostly through holograms) that fits the game world. You're left with a third person perspective that feels incredibly immersive and cinematic. I liked how most of the weapons had a utilitarian use (cutting, mining, torching, etc) that fit within the game world rather than just being military in design. The zero-g sections of the game did a good job of distorting your perspective and in a couple cases gave me that weird feeling in your gut like you're falling. It reminded me of Prey (2006). There's some solid Sci-Fi elements to be found here too.If there's a weak point, it comes from the story. It's not bad, but certainly not great. It doesn't bring anything new to the table and that's not necessarily a bad thing, just a little disappointing. What it does bring though, comes with competence, at least at first. The setup is perfect. You're there to investigate a communications black out. It was intriguing to unravel the mystery of what happened on the USG Ishimura. But near the end of the game, all the typical tropes and cliches of the genre surface and you're left scratching your head as to some character motivations and the would-be twists that you saw coming a mile away. Had the story been less typical and more interesting, I would call this a must play title. But it misses that mark for me. Near the end of the game I grew weary of the tasks and the ""but first you need to do this"" missions. I spent about fifteen hours for my play-through on normal difficulty and around hour ten I seemed to have built up a tolerance for the jump scares. My fear dropped a couple notches down to anxiety, but I'd say that's probably normal for most people and just the nature of repetition.Still, it's easy to forgive any negative points when you're having such a great time. The game lives up to the atmosphere of titles like BioShock and Resident Evil: Remastered. It's one of those games I'll buy the art book for. It's scary and well crafted throughout.TL;DR: Play this game.			"

												Buying the Humble Origin Bundle with the knowledge that 2/3rds of the Dead Space series was included, my feelings were probably akin to a royal food tester's: I love the banquet, but the thought of that one deadly dish is absolutely terrifying. I've played my share of Survival Horror (starting with the granddaddy of them all, Alone in the Dark), but there's just something about Dead Space that's truly terrifying - the same reason Amnesia still sits on my digital shelf collecting digital cobwebs.But then the backlog starts piling, and a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. I finished Dead Space, and that should count as something when I get to Purgatory. The worry of absolute terror never ended - that's really something considering the game clocks in about 12 hours; and most survival horror/action games usually lose the terror after a few hours of collecting heavy weaponry. I was hooked with the atmoshpere and story that borrows a lot from scifi horror greats, but somehow puts its own stamp of uniqueness on what it steals.Speaking of uniqueness, there's a lot of it in Dead Space. The gameplay twist that enemies go down easier by shooting off their limbs instead of the head sounds wonky in the beginning, but a few encounters with the necromorphs made me a believer. It's perfect because arms and legs tend to move more erraticly than one's head, which adds to the tension when aiming. Also, as a result, probably the most unique weapons I've handled in a game were created for this Dead Space. The cutter, the linegun, the ripper, all have their special use when it comes to dismemberment, with just the right amount of frustration to give them character - give them a sense that these are real tools.Another thing to note is the game's inventory system. Very much like Resident Evil's limited slot-based  inventory, complete with external storage nodes that transfer excess baggage from one spot to another, Dead Space ups the ante by adding money to the mix. This actually made inventory management fun instead of frustrating, as I was figuring out how much of which ammo I should have, I should sell in exchange for Power Nodes (basically upgrade points). It became a mini game in itself. I'd be sad to hear if this lead to the adoption of microtransactions in Dead Space 3, but for this humble begging, it's very much welcome. (It also helps that plot items have their own inventory space, so need to worry about not having a crucial item when you need it).That's Dead Space in a nutshell. A rancid, mutating death nutshell. I'm still getting that same sense of thrill/dread about sampling the next two installments, so maybe I'll give the other gut-friendlier dishes in my buffet a try for the time being.			"

												The first installment in the Dead Space series is set in the year 2508 and begins when a mining starship, the USG Ishimura, sends out a distress signal during a mining operation on the planet Aegis VII. In this game, players step into the role of Isaac Clarke ― a ship systems engineer whose journey starts on a seemingly routine mission to fix the communication systems on the planet cracker.It is not long until he realizes that he stepped into a living nightmare of vicious alien creatures and a dead silence ship where he must constantly fight to get out alive.The story in Dead Space is one of its strongest points. Most of it is told via video, audio and text diaries you find scattered around the ship. Another strong point is the atmosphere, a lot of it due to brilliant sound effects. It's a very impressive looking game overall, though sometimes you will feel like you are going through the same corridors over and over again. The combat is also good. Some sections may look a bit repetitive, however, the strategic dismemberment and the stomping are just extremely fun and satisfying.Being a fan of the survival horror and sci-fi genres, I played this game myself and have watched other people play it, and it simply does not get boring. It does stop being truly scary after the first few hours but jump scares are always around the corner.			"

												A true masterpiece. This game is a literally terrific combination of despairing emptiness, gory shootouts, and frigthening silence. It won't make itself impossible to play as Amnesia would, yet it will make you clinge to your chair and try to remember what on Earth made you start playing on the first place.Some people had problems with the camera and mouse, but I haven't seen any of that. Even more, I love how the game is controlled, similarly to Mass Effect.The lore is amazing, it will drag you and cry for more when it ends. Luckily there is more, by now. The art concept is sort of a crossover between ""zombie apocalypse"", ""steampunk"" and ""space conquest"", which I love to no end.You just can't go wrong buying this game.			"

												Dead frustratingOkay, let’s get the bad out of the way first. The controls for the PC version of this otherwise good game are the worst I have ever encountered. I won’t go into detail but they’re so awkward they almost spoiled the game for me. Almost. (There are also some truly annoying problems with camera and viewpoint angles, but don’t get me started on that!) But what about the good? DEAD SPACE succeeds, despite the aforementioned problems, mainly because it oozes atmosphere. This is a very claustrophobic game that sucks you in and really does induce anxiety. You will jump many times, trust me. The story is okay, within the usual limitations of such games, the voice acting is uniformly convincing, and the graphics are good but not outstanding. Where this game excels is in the way it draws you in; immerses you in it’s dark atmosphere. This is a game that makes your palms sweat, which is exactly what it’s supposed to do.3.5/5			"

												I have mixed feeling for this game.Pros1. It's not a regular shooting game where you blast through your enemies and do n0 sc0p3 360. It hits the sweet spot between shooting game and horror game.2. Headshots do jack♥♥♥♥♥♥ You have to cut off their limb to do more damage. Also most weapons are designed to be good at cutting things so it is forgiving to players like me who suck at aiming.3. You get to be a engineer that kills off things and saves the day much like Gordon Freeman(my favorite protagonist).4. The ambience is great. Distant sound of crying makes you scary. Footsteps in the vents makes you♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants. You can never be confident that you are safe.Cons1. Control is just terrible. Vsync on, latency is too high. Vsync off, you can barely look around with max mouse sensitivity and 3000dpi. You have to turn on vsync in your graphic card's settings. Too small FOV doesn't help either. Movement is also very delayed.2. You can barely do anything. You can't jump, duck. I keep doing stomp attack as I press space bar expecting Isaac to jump. Compared to half life 1 and 2, it feels so stiff. It would be much better if Isaac can at least duck.3. Menus being in the game itself is very creative, but it creats problems on keyboard. You can't use mouse or movement key to navigate menu(it will just make Isaac look around or move), so you have to move one hand to seperate keys. This gets annoying quickly.4. There are not many weapons and some of them are just useless. And more weapons you have, more varied ammo drops are and more inventory clog. I only used cutter and rifle and still had inventory problem.5. Battles get old pretty quickly. Same enemy, same stratagy. Puzzles are boring and too obvious. Game just drags after chapter 5 or 6.I wouldn't recommend this for full price. But it's worth buying when on like -75% sale.			"

												Hi, this is my first review on Steam and I'll keep it short. The main problem you might experience with the game is the bad port and the graphics issue. I have Windows 10 & Nvidia GeForce GTX 960 and it works fine after following the instructions of this short and simple video (it is not my channel, but it really helped me solve the problem quickly and easily):

												Don't let my low hours fool you. I have played through this game a number of times on my Xbox 360, but since I've stopped using my 360 (but still wanted to play this game), I bought it on Steam. Now, I thought I should address this issue first:I have heard a lot of people complain about the mouse and keyboard controls in this game. My advice: buy yourself a wired Xbox 360 controller, download the drivers for it, and use that. Apparently bad keyboard/mouse controls aside, this game does feel like it was made for controller, and the controler settings are solid.Now onto the actual game:The Positives:-- The story itself is good and I enjoyed it, but I felt like the story sometimes was a bit too far in the background (meaning I felt you were focusing purely on the objective and the story didn't really have much play in said objective). But overall, good story and despite the aforementioned, it was generally well implemented throughout the game. There are also twists, turns and little suprises that make it an awesome experience. Also, the ending was done really well!-- The atmosphere is fantastic! The got the lighting right, the sound effects right, crew logs, everything! It was just done so right!-- There are plenty of solid scares. There are some jump scares throughout the game and I know a lot of people hate those. But I'll be honest: jump scares really do work in this game.-- The weapons are very well done; although there are some weapon and general game mechanics that really do lend the player to using the basic starting weapon throughout the game (not that this is necessarilly a bad thing).-- Thought there is a realively straight forward (and argueably easy) way to play the game, there are so many other ways to play it. This ranges from weapons to the different modules (Stasis, Kenisis) to whether or not (and how) you use the object in the environment.-- There is enough variety in the enemies to make it interesting, but few enough to keep the game consistent ( if that makes sense). and as  the above point suggests, there is more than one way to fight each enemy (with the possible exception of the boss fights). I was say the enemies are very well done and always fun to fight.-- Boss fights are very well done, and the bosses are very cool!-- I know this is techincally part of the atmosphere of the game, but it is definitely worth mentioning on its own that the got creepy right! A lot of horror games get jump scares and maybe a few solid scares down-packed, but they never get the creepy element right enough to actually be creepy. This game does, and it does it well!The Negatives:-- The thumb-stick controls can sometimes feel a bit slow. It does feel like it should be a bit more twitchy. That being said, the controls do work rather well, so this negative isn't all that bad.-- Picking up items can be annoying in a select few situations. For example, an item maybe under a Stasis recharge point and instead of picking up the item, it will constantly engage the recharge point instead. That being said, there are other ways to pick up that item, but still....-- Save points are not disabled during combat. Intead of picking up ammo during a fight that I desperately needed, the game instead activated the save point and I died. To be honest, this has only ever happened once (and I've done three run throughs of this game on normal and my third attempt at doing it on hard).Overall, this dismemberment simulator is a very solid game with pretty much everything done right!9/10			"

												So I just finished this game for the very first time...What can I say...It's a decent game, I think the best way to describe it is by saying it's mixture between RE and Doom.The ending was a bit annoying before the last boss but once I reached him I had a blast again.Graphics are pretty impressive considering when it was released.Sound is really good too, play it with a headphone on and you'll feel really claustrophobic.I bought the pack (Dead Space and Dead Space 2) and paid only 18 bucks for it, it almost seems like stealing.Anyway, from 1 to 10 I'd give this game an 8.

												Dead SpaceBeing honest, I would say that Dead Space is like Resident Evil 4 in space with futuristic weapons. The atmosphere throughout the campaign accomplishs what its goal, scare the hell out of you, at least in your first playthrough. More that once I was suspicious about entering a room or walking near a corpse.The graphics are pretty nice, considering its kind of an old game. I have played Dead Space only with the xbox controller, and the mapping, movement and aiming were really good; don't know about keyboard/mouse. The sound quality is amazing, the background music or noises that you hear makes you turn around and check for any foe. Sometimes when you are shooting a necromorph, you hear some odd noises behind you, and then you realize you got another necromorph behind you D:The boss battles were nice, the upgrading system with nodes, and the store had me hook up in having everything upgraded and bought.I've played Dead Space like 6 times, and I do not regret it. It is totally worth your money. Btw, I beg your pardon if I've written something wrong, as english is not my first language.			"

												This game has such a fantastic atmosphere. Stranded alone on a derelict station, you fight for your life against weird aliens. The game very much reminded me of games like System Shock or Alone in the Dark (the classic one!), with its great sense of loneliness, fear and mysticism. The parts where you walk on the outer shell of the station are especially terrific.			"

												Great game. Although not as scary as amnesia or cry of fear, the gun play and other various mechanics are excellent. The story is pretty basic but does have quite a few twists and turns. The ending is not that great, but I have yet to play the second and third game to make a final decision on that. It's a pretty long game too, I only played on easy and it took me 8 hours, plus you still have some replayability if you want to fully upgrade your weapons and whatnot. Overall the game gets a 93/100 from me, I can only hope the next two games are just as good, if not better.			"

												Great game, picked this up to relive some of the good ol days. Problem is the game is broken on modern machines. In game vsync makes the game unplayable, but turning it off breaks progress relient triggers, makes the environemnt spaz out ect. Literally unplayable trash. Turning vsync on in nvidia control panal did not rectify the problem for me, though its apparently helped others. The fact that EA fixed the origin version of the game but didn't bother to fix the steam version is absolutle garbage. The fact steam is still charging 20 aussie bucks for this is godamn criminal.

This review covers some of the features of Visceral Games' original Dead Space title that make its atmosphere effectively tense and creepy.[. . .] The sense that player-character Isaac Clarke is on his own in Dead Space is incredibly pervasive. The design of the ship often puts him in humongous corridors and chambers, and the zero-gravity mechanic in many such areas sees Clarke juxtaposed to the vastness of the distances.

												Antes de começarmos a falar deste jogo lembre-se desse nome "" Warren Ellis "". Ele foi um dos escritores e produtores do jogo,onde todos queriam caminhar para um lado tendo Dead Space como um shooter em terceira com muito ação  e tiroteio ele foi o cara que disse ""NÃO"" Eu quero corpos dilacerados no chão muito sangue e um bela doze de horror,e em uma de suas entrevistas ele disse exatamente isso "" Eu quero que o jogador tenha medo de jogar Dead Space "" .Muitos podem ir de encontro mas pra min foi satisfatório.Dead Space faz com grande perfeição o que muitos jogos não tiveram capacidade de mostrar.Nesse jogo simplesmente não há limites para o horror ,de inicio a proposta é fraca,mas conforme a campanha vai se desenrolando  obriga o jogador a buscar o seu desfecho .O jogo possui uma jogabilidade honesta sem muito segredo e o nível de dificuldade em certos momentos chega a ser intrigante ,há diversos monstros na tela que o impossibilitam de realizar o seus atos . A escassez de munições e suprimentos de saúde é o ponto positivo e álíbi que o jogue tem de te mostrar que não é apenas atirar,atirar,atirar e atirar,de certa forma a outras formas de buscar o seu objetivo é claro dentro dos limites pré estabelecidos dentro do jogo .Em partícular eu recomendo joga-lo com Headset de alta qualídade ou média,pois o som do jogo é um absurdo de bom,foi realizado um  ótimo trabalha pela Visceral ao aplicar o som de maneira impecável nos ambientes da nave em que se passa o jogo.O fator medo esta presente em todo o jogo,inclusive há momentos em que aquele susto é inevitavel o jogo consegue fazer isso de forma simples e eficazAgora a controversia ,um grande título não é composto a penas por pontos posítivos e sim por negativos,sendo assim aqui fica alguns .• O personagem principal Isaac Clarke provavelmente deve ter o seus diálogos censurado dentro do jogo,pois eu não ouvi um diálogo se quer ,lamentável,deve ter esquecido de colocar algumas falas para ele,pois o que ele faz no jogo é fazer o que lhe é pedido sem argumentar em ipotese alguma .• Personagens sem carisma.• Muitos críticam que Dead Space é somente um corredor escuro com alguns monstro e nada mais.SIM! seria mais o menos isso,não á variações de monstros e o cenários são repetidos,muda algumas coisas de um para o outro .• Parte dos objetivos são clichês de outros jogos e chegar a ser cansativo . Definitivamente Dead Space traz o que há de melhor no cenário de horror SCI-FI.			"

												I played this game in 2017.After hearing much about it and seeing it on the steam winter sales,I decided to give it a go. And oh boy...I had a blast with Dead Space.This game holds up really well after 9 years. The graphics have aged very nicelyand the gameplay is by now legendary and for good reason.This game throws the most horrifying creatures at you to fight and hopefully survive. The fact that you have to shoot their limbs offis a huge breath of fresh air from the typical headshots. You are given a small but funvariety of weapons to kill the necromorphs and an amazing setting.The space station that has gone completely to♥♥♥♥♥♥is creepy as hell but beautiful at some moments.The tight hallways make every corner super scary.The part I liked the least was the story. It might have been a bit confusing at times but it was a greatmistery and a cool adventure.All together:If you wanna try something old but GOLD, Dead Space is well worth the 10 bucks it is right now.

												Genuinely brilliant horror game that manages to be scary without constantly resorting to jumpscares. Even on medium difficulty the game can get difficult, difficult to the point of being cheap at times. However these moments will not put you off, as if you persevere you'll be rewarded with a great narrative, extrremely fun gameplay and a fantastic ending. The game is fairly short but defineitely, DEFINITELY worth playing. 8/10.			"

												This game might be awesome, but I'll never know.  I can't change the basic keyboard mappings, because the ""accept"" or ""ok"" or whatever button is off the screen.  It doesn't matter what resolution I try (640x480, 1024x768, 1440x900, 1920x1080), no matter what, the menu disappears off the bottom of the screen so I can't click it, and no combination of arrow keys and hitting enter has got it to save, either.  I hate console ports.			"

												Dead Space is a fantastic survival/adventure/horror game. It's got some crazy cool mechanics like stasis and kinesis guns (slow down and move things respectively), tons of weird enemies, and tons of well made jump scares. On top of all that, it has a fluid storyline that keeps you wanting more! If that sounds good to you, then I highly recommend getting this game.			"

												For what it's worth, it's not much of a horror game. It's one of those adventure shooters that has ugly enemies. Whenever you pass by vents or see necromorph corpses that hasn't been disfigured, you'll already know that they're just there for jump scares. I will give points for the creepy atmosphere and all the bloody, organic rooms will give you chills. Bosses are also great, even though there's only three. The first one you encounter will let you use one of the game's mechanics of zero gravity jumps to dodge tentacles which makes you seem VERY cool and badass. The second one, I didn't enjoy much since I suck at aiming and then there's the gun overheating. The third and last one was actually a let-down compared the first one, which you'd expected it to be more of an overkill, slightly surviving with a slither of HP. The only thing good that came out of the last boss was how it picked you up and you were forced to use inverted controls to make you panic than you usually would. Then there's the storyline. I feel the twists were from an M. Night Shyamalan movie. You can already foreshadow what'll happen and the twists wouldn't really amuse you. It'll just give you sense of saying, ""Welp, more work to do."". Character developement are pretty bad. All you know about the protagonist is that he's here on an adventure to find his girlfriend and slowly becoming loopy while not knowing about it. Really, the only thing that comes out of the storyline is the lore and backstory and most people who comes to shooters just want to use their itchy trigger-fingers and kill everything on sight. All-in-all, this game is just a generic shooter from Point A to Point B. It's a great shooter from its time I'll agree to that; however, it's not a scary game if you're wanting to buy this game for that sole purpose.+ Gameplay+ Use of Mechanics+ Puzzles+ Backstory- Current Game Storyline (Dead Space II or III might have a better storyline, which I'll have to see)- Final BossI'll give it a 3/5.

Genre: Over-the-shoulder-TPS ""Survival"" HorrorReccommendation: A must play if you seek a challenging horror game with survival elements.Playtime: ~24 hoursRating: 9/10Review:One of the best sci-fi horror games out there. It's a Third Person Shooter, with an emphasis on aiming for the limbs of enemies rather than the body itself or the head. It is scary, but it's mostly just suspense, although very gruesome. This game's UI (User Interface) takes place as bars on the back of your suit (easy to see though), and windows are ""2.5D"" and they're on the world rather than on your HUD.Warning: If you are not okay with scary games, or you have a weak stomach, or you simply dislike gore, this game is likely not for you.The game has a very deep storyline, centering on a ""Maintenance Mission"" over at a wrecked spaceship, overrun by alien lifeforms which turned the spaceship's crew into mutants.As for gameplay, you are given ""cutting"" weapons, with a sort of laser sights so you can see the cutting area, and you have to aim at body parts like the shoulders, arms, hands, legs... Some enemies have other ""parts"". You need to learn how to kill each and every enemy efficiently in order to conserve ammo and health, as items are limited in this game. In this game there is also zero gravity areas where you'll be able to move around more freely (but not float around), and stand on most walls you see. Some areas have no oxygen, and your Air meter will run down per second, until you reach an area with oxygen. You are also able to use ""Stasis"", used for slowing down objects and enemies, giving you a better chance at doing certain things, especially saving ammo.Almost everything is upgradeable, including your HP, Air meter, Stasis, the damage/capacity/reload/speed of your weapons, Etc. This is done by consuming Power Nodes at an Upgrade Bench. You can buy those at stores, finding them around the ship, or receive them for killing powerful enemies.If you decide to play on Hard Mode, this is where the game truly shines. You'll need to be very careful on how you use your weapons, and you need to be aware of your surroundings. Items are used up quicker on Hard Mode, and you might see yourself going around with low HP often. I myself reccommend to play on Hard Mode, since this is a not-so-short game and Hard Mode makes it even longer and more interesting.Stability wise, this game isn't so good for that. It is rather old, but not too old, and normally plays well on most computers. There is, unfortunately, a ""mouse lag"" glitch, where aiming will never actually be smooth. It's easy to overcome this glitch though, and keep playing on while ignoring it.Tip: Disable V-Sync (Vertical Sync) on the in-game video options before you start playing, as it will only cause a lot of trouble and it'll increase the mouse lag further if left enabled.Replayability is okay, but the game is always interesting and fun no matter what.TL;DR: Really nice semi-scary game, lots of gore, very immersive and promotes aiming strategically. My rating is 9/10, almost the best game I've ever played.			"

												I have no idea why this has so many positive reviews. Yes, Dead Space is an amazing game… On console. However this is the absolute worst PC Port ever released. The PC port is one of the most broken things I've ever attempted to play. KB&M controls flat-out don't work and you get insane input lag when playing with a controller. And you are stuck between two abysmal choices. You can either play at an unlocked framerate, and have shadows and lights flash in migraine inducing strobes until you reach a point in the game where your unlocked framerate breaks the games logic and you become trapped by invisible walls that you can't get around without restarting the game, and I mean restarting, as in actually starting again from the beginning. Or you can enable V-Sync and the game locks the framerate to your monitors lowest possible refresh rate, which for me was a hot 24 fps. Yes. 24 fps. Can you play a shooter at sub 30, with a controller? I sure can't. Oh, it also crashes, often. If you really need to revisit Dead Space, sadly playing on console is the only viable option. Oh, and you'll likely end up unable to refund the game because it stays running in the background after you close it. Thankfully Dead Space 2 and 3 seem to run fine.TLDR: Great game, worst port of all time. Play it on console.			"

												I've always heard great things about this game, and the hype is right! I've finished the game and can barely wait to start the sequel!It's an over-the-shoulder shooter (much like Resident Evil or Mass Effect), and the immersion is incredible. There's no HUD blocking the screen, ammo displays are on weapons and your health is displayed on the back of your character's suit. All the in-game menus (Maps, Inventory, Journal, etc) as well as video and audio communication are displayed with holographic projections from your suit. The game also has areas of zero-gravity where you must navigate your way by flying across the rooms, and hopefully not plunge into deep space.The player takes the role of Isaac Clarke, an engineer and space ship systems specialist sent as part of a repair mission to the USG Ishimura, a large scale mining vessel. Upon arrival you quickly realize that disaster has struck the Ishimura and spend the game trying to get out alive. Throughout the game you can upgrade the space hazmat suit you wear, as well as buy and upgrade various weapons. The majority of the weapons you acquire are improvised tools, such as plasma cutters and buzz saws, reflecting that you're primarily an engineer, and not a soldier.All in all it's a great buy; solid gameplay, a gripping story, and an incredible soundtrack.

												Dead Space is a fantastic survival/adventure/horror game. It's got some crazy cool mechanics like stasis and kinesis guns (slow down and move things respectively), tons of weird enemies, and tons of well made jump scares. On top of all that, it has a fluid storyline that keeps you wanting more! If that sounds good to you, then I highly recommend getting this game.			"

												Dead space 1 is a great game and in my opinion worth it full price. While it's not a really scary game in my opinion it does have it's moments where you're scared for your own survival and feel a bit over run or have run out of ammo. This game has a great story as well and is followed up by Dead Space 2 in which in my opinion was the best of the 3 main Dead space games.Don't buy Dead Space 3 though if you want to play it, don't just watch gameplay of it's story and don't go near it. It's a horrible game.			"

												This game might be awesome, but I'll never know.  I can't change the basic keyboard mappings, because the ""accept"" or ""ok"" or whatever button is off the screen.  It doesn't matter what resolution I try (640x480, 1024x768, 1440x900, 1920x1080), no matter what, the menu disappears off the bottom of the screen so I can't click it, and no combination of arrow keys and hitting enter has got it to save, either.

The missions are alot of fun and very inventive. The graphics are very awesome and really get you into the game more. The sounds in the game make it really creepy to walk down a hall. The gameplay takes getting used to because you have to deal with looking behind the character the whole time. The story is very good and is not hard to follow. Its one of those games you have to play twice to fully understand everything. It is a great game and a perfect length for this type of game. I loved playing it! Get it and you wont regret it!			"

												There's no denying that Dead Space is at least a little creepy, with it's suffocating corridors, hellish necromorphs, and the vast open terror of space itself, all to be explored alone on tight ammo. It's a bit repetative when played alone, as you gradually come to expect everything (although it can be fun in the dark with a good pair of headphones...), but there's an easy remedy for that:Grab a friend, sibling, spouse, parent, legal guardian, acquaintence, dependent, or otherwise to help you out. They work the keyboard and you work the mouse. I can say from experience that when both of you are relatively inexperienced with playing keyboard and mouse, and both of you are fresh players, it's a good time. The panic doubles, as not only do you not know what the game's AI is doing, but you also have no idea what your partner is doing. The ensuing madness is a romp; you gotta try it at least once.			"

												Finished the game on Medium difficulty.One of the best action-horror games I've played.  +Interesting story w/ good twists+Great pacing - constant feeling of tension.+Great sound - you will hear things you can't see, like creepy whispers, things crawling around, and creepy growls/shrieks.+Great action - the dismemberment system is a lot of fun.  Forces you to carefully aim in tense situations.+Feeling of progression - upgradeable equipment/armor.  +Little to no backtracking. -This is a personal complaint, but a 180 degree turn like in the action Resident Evil games would've been helpful.-Vsync forces 30fps.  I get about 350+ fps w/ vsync off with my gtx 970, causing horrible screentearing.  Vsync w/ nvidia control panel didn't work so I used D3DOverrider to force vsync at 60fps.  A small annoying step, but it's easy to do and IMO necessary to get the best experience.  +/- Graphics - played this 2008 game in 2014.  Sometimes the graphics look very good, sometimes it looks dated.  However, it never took away from the immersion.+/- You might not like how much of the game is in a confined space. I liked it b/c it made things more tense.+/- The field of view might be too limited for you.  I thought it was fine and never noticed it until I read complaints. TL;DR - Buy if you want a sci-fi game that scares you, but still gives you the power to kill everything.			"

												Definitely a game at the very least worth playing. Dead Space brings to the table elements of both survival-horror and RPG while maintaining a (third-person) shooter image. The storyline is fairly well written as while it's nothign special, it works out and it isn't boring really. The game itself is challenging but not in an attritional sense where it's only hard because of the sheer amount of enemies as opposed t the design and challenges itself. It's a hard game but not unfair (unless you pick that difficulty!). The gameplay is fluid and the battles are fun whilst challenging.It's also a great thriller game, with many moments made to get you to jump in your seat.Graphically speaking it's not a Crysis-level game but it still looks pretty damn good. The weapons and environemnts look nice, and the armour shines very well. You won't be disappointed.Maybe not worth $50 any more, but with how differently you can play with the varying weapons and abilities, it definitely has some replayability. Try to pick it up when you can.			"

												I'm not typically into horror titles, but I really liked this game. You don't play as a front-line combat jock, but as an engineer. Movement isn't fluid like most 3rd person shooters. The aliens you fight don't die from just getting shot, you need to figure out how to cripple and deal with them with your limited ammunition, and usually using unorthodox weapons. The sound is great and you might just be too creeped out to turn the lights off at the end of the night. All-in-all I really enjoyed it and even beat it twice. The other games in the series move further away from the horror aspect and become more fluid shooter titles.I've played with keyboard & mouse and a 360 controller. Both schemes have flaws, with the controller not having enough sensitivity, and the K&M seeming to have a sensitivity filter added at weird times. Steam has edited my play time for some reason. This game used to boot through steam, then through origin, and now back in steam.			"

												Worth a purchase at a much reduced price like $5.  The plot line is absolutely atrocious although I have to remind myself that with how old this is, it might have just been growing pains of a genre.  It felt like someone opened the trope/McGuffin book and was racing to get as many in as they could before the game ended.  I started to keep a running tally, mocking the story to my friends as I went chapter by chapter.  But I played it all of the way to the end.  I even hypothesized why I didnt quit this like I did many other lackluster games in my Steam library.  After fixing the mouse issue, the game controls perfectly like it should for a horror game.  Just methodical enough for you to agonize if you are going to make the shot towards the monster charging at you.  The setting, level design (although its repeated), and above all the atmosphere are top notch.  The light RPG customization, zero G fights, the variations of QTEs, bosses, and regular minion waves that you can run right by.  The story setpieces almost detract from the moment to moment of playing the game.  I made to the end happy for the silly story to be over but appreciative of everything else.  It was worth the time to finish it, and I havent finished a game in a very long time.			"

												I love to hate it.Iam easily scared by jumpscares in videogames and Dead Space does it's job really well. In fact its predecessor Dead Space2 was the first of these kinds of games i forced myself through.I played this halfway through on a Xbox360 but never managed to get through completly... I will try to change that. Im just not that fast at it. I usally play 30minutes at a time, maybe that will increase over timeBesides my own cowardness, this game is really good. Especially how it manages jumpscares.You walk down a dark hallway, suddenly a random pipe bursts...""haahahahaha fooled you!...- No really, the monster is behind you.""I fell for that one multiple times.I really like the story going on, thats whats getting me to start the game again from time to time.Buisnesswise it's a great example of an AA Game. It doesn't had a big marketing campaign and it didn't need to ""appeal to a broader audience"" like Dead Space 3. It was made for people who like to play horror games and that was just fine. Unfortunatly those days are long gone. With Dead Space3 we finally arived in an era where every game has to appeal to everyone, especially to CoD Players, since CoD is the best selling game ever (at that time) and EA wanted a piece of that cake too. It's just that CoD Players usally play CoD and are not that much interested in Horrorgames that try to appeal to them. Anyway, Dead Space is a gem of the days when development budgets weren't so high and the expectations neither. When a game could still be a sucess without selling 7 million copies. Dead Space knows what it wants to be (a mean ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that is) and pulls it of perfectly.If you are into horrorgames, this should be a nobrainer. Keep calm and shoot of their limbs.			"

												Definitely worth your time. Visuals still hold up even though it's a console port from years ago. Do recommend playing with a controller. Gameplay and gunplay is solid. Only in some ""zero-gravity"" areas are the combat controls a bit wonky. Satisfying story and great level design. A couple of jump scares but after you play for a while: when entering a new area you can kind of 'see' that it's ganna be a fighting area, so you get used to that. I always walked around in aim mode ready to shoot though.Solid, solid game.			"

												Dead Space provides a unique survival-horror title that not only manages to give you a feeling of vulnerability, but a unique experience in space that stays believably grounded in the field of ""plausable science"" which in turn makes science fiction great.			"

												Definitely a game at the very least worth playing. Dead Space brings to the table elements of both survival-horror and RPG while maintaining a (third-person) shooter image. The storyline is fairly well written as while it's nothign special, it works out and it isn't boring really. The game itself is challenging but not in an attritional sense where it's only hard because of the sheer amount of enemies as opposed t the design and challenges itself. It's a hard game but not unfair (unless you pick that difficulty!). The gameplay is fluid and the battles are fun whilst challenging.It's also a great thriller game, with many moments made to get you to jump in your seat.Graphically speaking it's not a Crysis-level game but it still looks pretty damn good. The weapons and environemnts look nice, and the armour shines very well. You won't be disappointed.Maybe not worth $50 any more, but with how differently you can play with the varying weapons and abilities, it definitely has some replayability. Try to pick it up when you can.			"

												While it's graphics at this age are vastly out of date, it will always be my favorite jump-scare game. It was my first horror game and I have finished it on Xbox. Original story, surprising and terriying turns of events. Just a good game a good classic, if you can look past the graphics and small bugs this game had then I greatly advise that you play it, limited replayability but a good amount of playtime for the story, an impossible challenge on higher difficulties (you will have 0 ammo) and a game that will never give me back my heart that last necro stole from me. 7/10 (7/10 just because of it's age)			"

												Immersive, Impressive, Addictive...the more you play it, the more you love it...I'm just six years late to start playing Dead Space. I must confess it wasn't my favorite game sytle until last week. So I decided to go through it and here I am: looking foward to go playing through the dead space trilogy...amazing game, awesome details, interesting atmosphere, very good sound effects and cinematics. The surprising features:1. The game engine is smooth with loading screens only in chapter transitions;2. The level design is amasingly perfect and creepy as well;3. Overall plot is very good and its main and secondary objectives are interesting;4. There are two mini games on it;5. Weapons visual, sound, and physical effects are really cool. No standard military weapons;6. Enemies are creepy and disgusting...but funny to kill;7. Boss fights are good;8. There are 'store feature' that allow you buying and selling in game items;9. Weapon upgrades are enjoyable and worth;10. In game player interfaces are well developed and animated (cargo lift buttoms, weapon benches, stores, control pannels);11. Looting system provides well balanced sort of items throughout the whole game (ammo, medkits, money, etc);12. Zero gravity missions and fights are as awesome as tense;13. Different sort of weapons provides an interesting replayability. Try only few weapons at a time and see the difference in game play and difficulty level;14. Story telling is well balanced between direct dialogs and in game information (video logs, text logs, cut scenes, etc).Overall, the game is still worth playing even at 6 years later. Just play it and have fun.			"

This game is best played by yourself in the dark with good headphones. The horror, combat and basically dialog of the entire game was just beyond amazing. If you have doubts to play this game, don't.

												Although the game can seem a bit long for how simple the synopsis and variety of encounters are, the sense that the pacing is strange and unpredictable only amplifies the effects of the atmosphere.  The game mechanics are suited exceptionally well to the horror environment, not only leaving you with limited resources and carrying space, but also requiring some intelligent and unique aiming requirements that set the experience apart from the world of headshots typical of a game with guns.Not every situation uses the mechanics in an exceptionally exciting way, but each has at least one encounter which fits it perfectly, and justifies it's existence.  It can be hard to stick with at times, but overall felt worthwhile.			"

												Worth a purchase at a much reduced price like $5.  The plot line is absolutely atrocious although I have to remind myself that with how old this is, it might have just been growing pains of a genre.  It felt like someone opened the trope/McGuffin book and was racing to get as many in as they could before the game ended.  I started to keep a running tally, mocking the story to my friends as I went chapter by chapter.  But I played it all of the way to the end.  I even hypothesized why I didnt quit this like I did many other lackluster games in my Steam library.  After fixing the mouse issue, the game controls perfectly like it should for a horror game.  Just methodical enough for you to agonize if you are going to make the shot towards the monster charging at you.  The setting, level design (although its repeated), and above all the atmosphere are top notch.  The light RPG customization, zero G fights, the variations of QTEs, bosses, and regular minion waves that you can run right by.  The story setpieces almost detract from the moment to moment of playing the game.  I made to the end happy for the silly story to be over but appreciative of everything else.  It was worth the time to finish it, and I havent finished a game in a very long time.			"

												Having played the demo on the Xbox 360, I had to get this when it was on sale. I've always been a fan of Resident Evil (1, 2, 3, 4, REmake) and this immediately caught my eye. This really is like the Alien of the gaming world (as another review states), and if the games based off the Alien movies were THIS good I would have bought them all. It's got great graphics, fantastic acting, a gripping and chilling story accompanied by a great soundtrack and an insanely fun choice of weapons.It's jumpy as hell, if you can't handle jumping out of your skin every few minutes then this might not be your game. It creeped me out so much at one point I had to take a break, but all the while I just wanted to jump back on and keep going.Honestly, I struggle to find anything bad about this game. Yes, it is THAT good. My ONLY gripe is it's quite tricky to get mouse sensitivity the way you want...but, me being a gamepad user, this didn't bother me too much.9/10, easily one of the best games I ever played. In years to come, I'll still be playing it.			"

												DEAD SPACEWithout a doubt this has been one of the most enjoyable FPS horror games I have ever played. Intense atmosphere and great jump scares make this game a thoroughly memorable experience. The Scfi genre generally lacks good horror games, but this game is worth every single penny.Replay value: There is very little replay value since all the jump scares are scripted and predictable, however, new game plus makes for an interesting experience.Final Verdict: Can you really say you are a respectable gamer until you have played this game? NO you cannot not. BUY IT! PLAY IT! You will love it or we will find you....Score8.9/10 "

												This is an interesting trilogy so I had to start from the beginning. Although there are a few parts that make it feel like Dead Space: Prepare To Die Edition this is a great game. The weapons and powers are cool. Everybody thinks Resident Evil in space but it's actually got A 3rd person Crysis look also. The creatures are INSANE, better than Doom III. Whoever designed them, pure genius, just VERY cool. If you are a fan of 3rd person shooters, this is a must have game. If you are a fan of horror, this is a must have game. If you are a fan of both, like I am, then you will be VERY happy that you gave it a chance. The creatures, weapons, and innovative gameplay are what make this game SO worth every penny. Playing Dead Space 2 soon and will review as soon as I finish the game but I already know that it will be even better somehow. Dead Space 3 is the questionable one, I guess it is unavailable on Steam but I will have to at least give it a chance too when it goes down in price enough. I am a thrifty PC Gamer but this game was a smart buy!			"

												Что-ж, перепройдя эту игру, я несколько изменил свое мнение в сторону ее ""мрачности"".Ишимура не будет пугать вас скримерами, гигалитрами крови и тоннами кишок, жуткой музыкой и темнотой. Она оставит впечатление покинутости, заброшенности. Это одна из тех немногих игр, весь ужас происходящегося в которых раскрывается через дневники и записи. И раскрывается настолько, что от представления описанных в очередном докладе событий холодеют ноги. Вы можете пройти ее, как шутер: убивая всех подряд, проводя часы в ходках по магазинам, но я все-таки рекомендую вам читать найденные дневники, сопоставляя происходящее там с тем, что творится на экране. Игра безумно мрачная. Определенно рекомендуется к прохождению. "

DS1 has the best atmosphere of any game in the series, which rapidly degenerates to mainstream ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t with few meaningful elements from the original.My experience: DS1, DS2, DS3, & Extraction Point, both movies (first was better btw) & the comic (quite enjoyable).The definitive Dead Space experience.

												TIME TO COMPLETE: 13.5 hoursBack when I first played Dead Space on the Xbox 360 it was the game which scared me; now it's the controls.I feel as if I should get this aspect cleared out first. The controls kinda suck and even on the highest sensitivity the clunkiness what still there to a certain extent though you'll be surprised when you get used to it looking back. It's more like that kind of game where you have to take a couple minutes to get used to them each time you start it up but then master them with ease.The weapons are great. There's something for each when it comes to a form of dismemberment but while I think you're not really dependant on any there's still the same 4 weapons you'll stick to every time you play. Considering that later on you'll probably upgrade them only strengthens the point further. The story seemed to have a much faster pacing than before though that could be said of many replays of different games. Nothing felt rushed and the story manages to captivate you no matter how much but overall it tends to be cliche. Without spoiling anything back in 2008 there was still a lot of unexplored ground but even then I wouldn't have considered it an original idea aside from the iconic, industrial aesthetic Dead Space has.As far as chapters or levels go you have 12 of them, each ""moduled"" into contained segments. While this kind of design is almost a synonim to linearity it makes up for when taken apart. You'd have a  friend come over and play a chapter from the middle of the game without necessarily needing to fill in what happened. Tight animations, ""resource management"" type of combat - that's what this game is.Overall Dead Space is a fun adventure for those who wish to play a horror game or shoot Necromorphs (or ""alien zombies"", whatever you wanna call 'em) in a manner similar to Doom 3. I had a pretty solid, almost ""cinematic"" experience with it and for the price it gets when on sale it's a nice offer. Dead Space is clearly a classic of the horror genre.			"

												Dead Space relies very heavily on jumpscares and shocking imagery for it's horror. Don't get me wrong, it can certainly get quite tense every now and again, but it never really starts to feel like a 'Survival Horror' game as the game is fairly generous with both ammunition and health. Unless you're playing on higher difficulties you're probably not going to find the game all too challenging to be honest.That being said, Dead Space ironically excels at one of the aspects often done poorly in horror titles: It's combat. Almost every weapon in your arsenal is viable in any situation, giving you some very refreshing freedom to find a playstyle that suits you. The violence and gore is definitely also satisfying for those of us that enjoy watching limbs come flying off. The voiceacting is solid and the soundwork in general is very tight.You are very rarely (if ever) bored while playing Dead Space as you'll find yourself utterly immersed in it's great combat almost all the time, except for when the game gives you a break, typically in the form of exposition-sequences or fairly decent puzzles. While you don't have to be a math student to get over these hurdles they can definitely throw a spanner in the works every now and again. 7/10 - Complete with a compelling story with a few surprising twists along the way I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes gore, violence and a character that controls like a tank. The only real downsides to this game I can think of off the top of my head is perhaps the slight lack of challenge, the unreasonably confusing map, and the fact that it has some severe issues with Mous/Keyboard controls. A gamepad is strongly recommended for this title.			"

												Dead space is a great game, but this port is aweful. I have tried every fix for the door bug at the start of the game and nothing works. I have try all of the solution offerd on the forums and still cannot fix this game breaking bug. Even more concerning is how common this bug is, also many of the solutions involving changing settings in the game file, or tricking the in game v-sync. Most who say they have fixed the bug are still pluaged with game bugs and bad controls. Well I am one of the few who paid for this game. So i guess EA got my money and I cant even play the game.			"

												If you're purely looking for a good survival horror I'd let this one pass - unless you've never played any survival horror games before. Haven't found any of it frightening in the slightest so don't go in expecting Silent Hill in space or you'll be thoroughly disappointed. The look and music are quite nice but together they just don't create a nervewracking atmosphere. Decent action and story. Monster design is quite cool but not scary. Controls are a bit OHFIHP)HY)HY$G)U and the over-the-shoulder perspective is annoying at first but you do get used to the latter. Don't think it is something I'd play more than once though happy enough to say it's worth buying.			"

												The controls on this feel clunky and unresponsive on mouse/keyboard. Obviously meant to be played with a controller. Also, the 3rd person camera with limited FOV makes it hard to see considering your character takes up half the screen. One of the very few games I asked for a refund on.If you play with a controller and like 3rd person (which sometimes is ok, but for a horror game?), then maybe you'll like this, but with mouse/keyboard I certainly didn't.

												Short verdict: a door opening simulator that pretends to be scary.Deadspace had a potential. It's, in general, a decent game and there are a few good things in it, but those good things are overshadowed by stupid concepts and suboptimal controls.I'll start with the good things.- ""Dead Space"" is, all-in-all, a well-polished game. It runs smoothly, everything is thoroughly designed. When there's so many buggy and sloppy games out there, it matters. However, I encountered a game-breaking bug at the end of Chapter 11, when I couldn't open a door and it was on stand-by constantly. I had to use another player's save file that I've downloaded from the Internet to finish the game.- There is a nice set of weapons that you can upgrade. Upgrades are always a good thing, aren't they?- The level design is intuitive. And even, if you're not sure where to go, you can activate the path marking. That is very handy. It's much better than a mini-map.- 95% of the time game responds to your needs. Low on health? You get a health pack in the next crate or enemy. Low on ammo? Same thing.- Apart from shooting enemies, you also have some powers: stasis let's you slow down enemies and time; kinesis allows you to move objects/body parts. There are also zero-gravity areas, where you can walk on the walls and jump over large distances.Frankly, I didn't enjoy those powers and I absolutely hated the zero gravity missions. I'd rather prefer just shooting the hell out of things. But, at least the devs have tried and variety doesn't hurt. So, I appreciate that.And, now, (TA-DA-DA-DAAH), the bad things:- You need to dismember enemies to kill them. No, a headshot is not enough. A body shot does minimum damage. You need to shoot off their limbs/tentacles. It's so unnatural and because of the problematic aiming, also annoying.- On medium and higher difficulties, the enemies are bullet damage sponges. To shoot off a fricking tentacle, you need 2+ direct hits.  A fricking tentacle! Not an armored tentacle. Not a metal tentacle. Just a simple, tiny, soft-tissue tentacle! It just doesn't make sense. While playing on medium difficulty, I was constantly low on ammo in the last few chapters.(Note: on easy, it's a cake walk. You can shoot without any worries about ammo count).- Controls. The character is slow. Melee animation takes approximately 3-4 seconds to finish. The aiming lags. It's hard to hit a target, especially, in those sequences, when you're grabbed by that gigantic tentacle with the yellow bulb.Also, I played this game with an Xbox controller. It's easier like that. And, apparently, this game was primarily made with consoles in mind (framerate capped at 30 FPS, unmentioned controller support, cheats work only with a gamepad), BUT, when I need to shoot the asteroids or the monster in the outer space from a cannon, that is accomplishable only with a mouse. In short, this game has some serious camera and sensitivity issues. Some players even say that it's unplayable. And it's not much of an exaggeration.- Forced and narrow FOV. Unfortunately, Dead Space is not a first-person shooter. You have a very limited field of vision. I understand that the devs did that to prevent the players to notice the enemies that crawl behind, to make it more scary. But it's not scary. It's just inconvenient and, occasionally, annoying, especially, in some puzzles, when you need to oversee a large area, but you can't, because of the FOV.- The whole dismemberment concept. The idea is that the corpses can't transform into the monsters (necromorphs), if they are dismembered, and some might think that it's cool and gory. Except that it isn't. It's stupid and childish. And, since the human corpse dismemberment doesn't have any impact on the gameplay and, most of the time, you dismember the monsters with weapons anyway, so why bother? I think that it's a failed concept.- It's not atmospheric, it's not scary. There's nothing ""horror"" about it. The game overuses jump scares to make it seem scary, but it fails. Without the proper atmosphere, those things just do not work. Also, there are a lot of safe zones in between. So, no sweat. Not that I care, I just like to shoot things. But, for those of you who do care, I recommend F.E.A.R. It does a much, much better job at creating a tense atmosphere.- The story is mediocre. And many questions are left unanswered. I did understand what happened before and during the events of the game. And there are some explanations of why some characters did what they did, and what is the history with the Marker and the Church of Unitology. But those explanations are bad. It just doesn't make sense to me. I watched this video to find the answers: 


YouTube™ Video: The mostly accurate lore of Dead Space 

			Views: 32,019		

			Before you play Dead Space 3, you'll probably want to get caught up on the lore. Here is a way that you could that. Before you ask, yes, that is a dry-erase marker, no, swords aren't canon, and yes...		

 But it still seems like a non-sense to me.- Puzzles. Firstly, puzzles in a shooter? Why? Second, they are boring and all the same: you just need to re-arrange objects. Third, the FRICKING NARROW FOV!!!It's hard for me to decide, whether to put ""thumbs up"" or ""down"", but I think, all-in-all, Dead Space gameplay is so problematic that I can't recommend it. I did not really enjoy playing it, I finished it only because it was not bad enough not to finish it.My overall rating: 5/10.			"

												It's unfortunate, but, before I was able to really play this game, the option of giving it a positive review went right out the window. Yet again, a publisher treated the PC version of a title like an afterthought and gave us a slapped together copy/paste P.O.S. console port that CANNOT RUN WITHOUT THE AID OF THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE. The vsync is broken and locks the game at 30 fps, and if you turn it off (assuming you can get past the screen tearing) it actually causes quite a few problems with the game. I can only assume that the movement and camera controls are in some way dependent on polling the framerate because it actually causes the mouse to have major problems and creates an invisible wall in a doorway very early on in the game. This can be fixed, but not without disabling the in-game vsync and forcing it through 3rd party software - in fact, the forced vsync option in AMD's Crimson control panel can't even get it to work (and from what I read, this is the same with the default control panel for NVIDIA cards) so you have to use a program like RadeonPro to get it to work properly.If that wasn't bad enough, the controller support is terrible. First, there are no separate controller / keyboard & mouse settings - this is an all-too-common problem with PC games and it really shouldn't be; I often like to switch between the two (and I know I'm not alone), but, without separate settings for a controller, I have to pause the game, go into the control settings and properly invert the Y-axis every time I want to use the controller and then disable it every time I want to use the keyboard & mouse - they are entirely disparate control systems that require their own settings. And just in case that wasn't aggravating enough, you actually have to enable/disable the controller entirely, adding an additional, tedious step to an already tedious process.  Even if you decide to just commit to the controller entirely (and let's face it, unless you want to be constantly bouncing in and out of the settings window, you kind of have to), the deadzones on the control-sticks are HUGE so moving the camera with any kind of precision is out of the question, and precision aiming is a KEY game mechanic in Dead Space - you're supposed to slice apart the enemies limb-by-limb. They don't even offer a camera sensitivity slider for the controller - just the mouse - so to use a controller you have to use something like Durazno - an Xinput modification program - and bump up the anti-deadzone to 45%-50%.I hate leaving a bad review for this game because, so far, the game itself seems great, and if you're someone who is willing to take the time and effort to get it working, you'll probably really enjoy it (just make sure you get it on sale). But when a publisher refuses to put the time and money into making a true PC version of thier game and instead just s*** out some console-to-PC-port garbage that won't even run without putting in hours of time troubleshooting issues that should have been ironed out before the game was ever released, I can't and won't give it anything less than a scathing review. F*** you very much, EA! "

												This is an EXCELLENT game. That is as much as you need to know about it, there are many things that can be said, but it all boils down to ""Dead Space"" being an excellent game. It is completely worth the $19.99 steam is asking for it, but if you have waited this long to buy it, im sure you can wait a lil longer still for one of their many sales and pick it up a tad cheaper.My one complaint of the entire deadspace series (well, 3 has a few, but this isnt the place for that :P) is that a few of the controls are hardbound and cannot be remapped. That forced me to use a controller for the duration of the series, except during very brief sections of the game when you take control of a very large gun and it was simply too dificult for me to complete with the controller.Not reccomended for children under the age of 16 in my oppinion, or those prone to nightmares or anyone with a weak heart.

												Not many horror games use space as the backdrop and the few that do, usually do so with raving success. Dead Space is part of that. It's terrifying, but like any scary game, the longer you play it, the more desensitized to the fear you get. That and paired with the fact that you eventually (should you choose to) upgrade your weapons to a high degree usually means the monsters that scare you die in embarassing fashion.The method is in which this game does go out to scare you is cheap as well. There are a lot of jump scares and set pieces. Any time you enter a large enough room, you know there will be an ambush. Eventually, you can start predicting when the scares happen. Monsters come out through vents and the predictable blind corner will usually have one waiting for you. Vents are scattered throughout the ship you're stranded on, so when you instinctively feel like an ambush is going to happen, it's easy to set yourself up and defend the waves.Good game overall. Scary games of this type should be shorter though because you can feel that the developers themselves know that you're no longer scared so what they'll do with ambushes is just increase the waves, turning what's supposed to be scary into a full blown shoot out with paced rumbles that can sometimes last longer than you have patience for.The Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star rendition was sp00ky though.

												Don't bother trying to play this on Windows 10. It bugs before the first checkpoint, so even if you find an unofficial fix you still need to spaff 20 minutes up the wall before you can check if it worked. Mouse cursor flickers all over the screen. Sensitivity is completely off. Unplayable with a trackball. Anti-aliasing looks dreadful and the framerate is only lifted if you turn v-sync off, which you need. 0/10			"

												I played this game a while back & it had some serious problems.  Those problems still persist today.V-sync is broken.  It locks FPS to 30 & causes severe input lag.  Turning off V-sync breaks the game & renders it nearly unplayable.  You need to either use RadeonPro for AMD, or turn off V-sync in the game & turn it on in the control panels for your GPU.The aiming is terrible.  Using a Logitech F310 controller roughly 30% of the joytick is deadzoned.  This means you have to move the (R) joystick a rediculous amount just to get the aim to move slightly & moving it a tiny bit more will cause it to swing your aim far beyond where you're actually trying to aim.  KB/Mouse controls are even worse & revolve around negative mouse acceleration combined w/ a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥emulation of the controller aiming.  There is a fix for the mouse you can find here.  It's not really a ""fix"" as it just speeds up the mouse input which in turn makes it impossible to use the mouse in the menus.  You have to use keys for menus with this fix.http://steamcommunity.com/app/17470/guides/#scrollTop=522Asides those two issues the game is good but you will be frustrated with the aiming because there is no real fix for it that I can find other than increasing the mouse speed.  Good luck trying to play this with a controller as the dead zone on aiming is ridiculous.  I managed to beat it using KB/Mouse after using the fix but it was still frustrating as all hell.  Not recommending it because it's a bad port or just doesn't run well on modern machines.			"

												Not many horror games use space as the backdrop and the few that do, usually do so with raving success. Dead Space is part of that. It's terrifying, but like any scary game, the longer you play it, the more desensitized to the fear you get. That and paired with the fact that you eventually (should you choose to) upgrade your weapons to a high degree usually means the monsters that scare you die in embarassing fashion.The method is in which this game does go out to scare you is cheap as well. There are a lot of jump scares and set pieces. Any time you enter a large enough room, you know there will be an ambush. Eventually, you can start predicting when the scares happen. Monsters come out through vents and the predictable blind corner will usually have one waiting for you. Vents are scattered throughout the ship you're stranded on, so when you instinctively feel like an ambush is going to happen, it's easy to set yourself up and defend the waves.Good game overall. Scary games of this type should be shorter though because you can feel that the developers themselves know that you're no longer scared so what they'll do with ambushes is just increase the waves, turning what's supposed to be scary into a full blown shoot out with paced rumbles that can sometimes last longer than you have patience for.The Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star rendition was sp00ky though.

												Dead Space:TL;DR A msut play for any fan of survival-horror games.If you hate jumpscares there are a few in here but not too many as to turn you away.Full disclosure: NewGame+ 3 on retail disc.===========================================================================================================Pros: * Intense atmosphere of fear and anxiety* Excellent gore and physics* Masterful sound track that really sets the atmosphere up* Graphics are great and show little signs of age even after 8 years* Interesting puzzles* Animations are beautiful and fluid, you can actually feel the weight of Isaac's boots with each step* Voice actors are amazing* Necromorphs (monsters) are horrifyingly ugly, in a good way* Higher difficulty settings make ammo and health items more scarce and increase the necromorph population* The story is interesting and well made* Silent protagonist that fits well within the story* The gunplay and alternate fire modes are incredible in conjunction with the dismemberment system* Badass armor and weapons* Great upgrade system for the weapons and suit* New Game +* Inventory management is spot on and only makes the game more challenging* The game has no hud, instead the ammo counter and reticule are holograms from, the weapon and your inventory and video logs are holograms from your suit allowing you to move and explore while watching a log or managing your inventory.===========================================================================================================Minor Gripes:* While the camera is great for the most part, there are times where I wish I could swap shoulders to see around a corner better. It also feels a bit close at times but your character never obscures your view.* When trying to pick up a specific item on the ground can be a bit hard to grab the intended item when there are more than one in close proximity.* Controls are a bit hard to get used to on keyboard and mouse (specifically the menu navigation)* Enemies come from the vents on occasion which makes it rather obvious where they are going to spawn, which loosens the tension a bit* The areas with no oxygen are a bit annoying if you like to sightsee===========================================================================================================Cons:* Your money is going to Electronic Arts so they can continue their crusade against free will and good games.===========================================================================================================			"

												Third Person Shooter with horror elements. You are Isaac Clarke and you are an engineer. You are investigating research space station with which you lost contact. You discover that someting horrible has happened and now you have to fight for your survival. The story keeps you playing for a long hours.Audio9/10Graphics7.5/10Gameplay7.5/10Story8/10Time to beat11hrsSummary8.5/10PROS Pretty visuals with nice ""black and white"" concept Atmospheric Some views can still be breathtaking Findings. Lots of audio and text logs, which help you understand the story better. Great music playing in the background. Sound effects are very well prepared. They build the tension. Can be challenging. Some pretty nice scary moments. Captivating, interesting story Possibility to upgrade your weapons and suit.CONS Controls could be a lot better. ( I was playing mouse + keyboard ). Sometimes I was feeling like errand boy. ""Isaac, do that!"", ""Isaac, go there!"", ""Isaac, fix this!"". Come on! YOU'RE NOT MY SUPERVISOR! There're moments where graphics are noticably out-dated. But it don't mind in the end :) Final boss is a joke. Incredibly easy. Rigidbody gets crazy sometimes. Dead bodies can get stuck in various places.

												A seemingly easy investigation mission of the distress signals sent by a peculiar space vessel named Ishimura will lead you, Isaac Clarke, into the living horrors of deep space as you will delve into the nightmarish abyss created by an unknown and bizarre force. During this journey you will uncover the tale of USG Ishimura and what went awry on it, and, of course, you will meet its new ""inhabitants"".Storywise, the game narrative develops pleasantly, in a progressive pattern, as our protagonist ventures deeper into the space vessel to find out the truth about it, therefore you don't need to worry for a ""bland"" and ""colorless"" story, this game managing to deliver a multitude of emotions towards the player, from empathy and guilt to fear and horror.Furthermore, leaving the story aside, in my playthrough at least, I have never encountered a single software ""bug"", the only inconvenience I met was the camera movement sensitivity, even at maximum being too slow-moving and burdensome for my taste, but of course, that is only a personal issue. Moreover, in terms of features, this game comes with a nice upgrading mechanic, done at 'Benches' you encounter throughout the chapters with special obtainable items called 'Power Nodes', which are found, in most cases, in places you would normally miss, so don't forget to search thoroughly for those 'Power Nodes' because the game rewards handsomely those that collect them. Besides this feature, a thing to note is the saving system which is by 'Saving Stations' spread throughout the map. Shops are also a nice touch, the game letting you buy and sell equipment at your own discretion rather than forcing you to scrape by on what you find. Also, I would like to mention that Dead Space shares some similarities with Doom 3 and The Suffering in terms of story and gameplay, so, if you liked one of these titles you will certainly love this one.This title really deserves the praise it got from its cult because it's an outstanding example of the Horror genre in video games and I kindly recommend it to everyone in search of a finely crafted game.

												Dead space has got to be the creepiest most visceral horror shooter I've ever played, more so than FEAR.  The atmosphere / sound is fantastic, and most of all the creatures are extremely frightening.  The gameplay is standard for a horror FPS and very linear, however the immersion is so complete you don't notice - like the fact that the UIs for things like inventory, health, etc are integrated into the environment.  The story is genuinely interesting, but the world itself more so.  Highly recommended.			"

												I love this game so much and it always keeps you on suspense! The game play is quite challenging and the storyline is awesome. There is plenty of jump scares that will keep you on the edge of your seat. I do not suggest using headphones and being in a dark room because you'll pyshc yourself out big time.			"

												In space, no one can hear you scream -- or so went the tagline for a certain film set in space on a ship where things go terribly wrong a million miles from Earth. It's a classic game; dark, moody, dripping with the creeping terror that seeks your flesh as you trudge through the halls of the doomed USG Ishimura on a repair mission gone awry. The voice acting is superb, and the visuals are excellent even though the game is over 5 years old. It's a must-have for sci-fi horror fans, and a great game in general.			"

												Freaking scary imo. Very nice atmosphere. Especially the sounds are really awesome and make me♥♥♥♥♥♥my pants. Bought it for 2,50€ and very happy with it.The PC version has some problems which you can FIX easily. If you have too much Frames you will have bugs and the v-sync option ingame will make your mouse/joypad have a big inputlag.I used the program ""nvidia inspector"" and locked the frames at 73 (because i have a 75hz monitor) and activated v-sync through the program. With this settings the game works fine. Also the ingame ""antialiasing"" option is very bad so activate it through ""nvidia inspector"". I have it on 8MSAA and it looks very nice.Here some links how to fix the bugs (if you dont fix it you cant even get through the first door) and how to activate AntiAliasing.AntiAliasing/Antistropic Filtering -->  http://forums.guru3d.com/showthread.php?t=357956AntiAliasing/Antistropic Filtering -->  http://www.gargi.org/showthread.php?3609-Dead-Space-Antialiasing-auf-Nvidia-Karten-aktivierenBug fixing --> http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1725482You are a horror and sci-fi fan and still have not played this game yet?

												The number of inventory slots you have isn't enough to carry sufficient ammo from one Store to the next. I was running out of my bullet-based guns every time.Also, it seems like they had a real-time inventory just because they could. They don't even let you sprint when using it, so the only time you can use an invntory item is when there aren't enemies around. This means no stasis recharge and no oxygen recharge when you really need it. More realistic you say? It's the lack of realism that makes games fun. Get slashed once and die like you would in real life, then see if you like realism.Almost didn't complete this because the Store is real-time as well, so I couldn't resupply when there were enemies around. Just had to run for it. it means I couldn't complete the last part of the game which required guns, and I had to download an invincibility hack.Well worth its £3.00  =]			"

												This is a prime example of what happens when developers stop developing for PC and make games targeted for consoles only.  It is a game that wants to be System Shock.  It is filled with all the obligatory suvival horror tropes even down to monsters coming out of walls, harsh shadows, monsters playing dead, and the requisite jump scenes.  What it fails to deliver is gameplay that is actually any fun.  It starts well, and brings in neat features like zero-gravity, time-dilation, and telekinesis.  However, In short order managing those features, and their related resource constraints, becomes just another chore.  All this is even get past the absolute worst part of this game: the nonresponsive controls that just scream ""Nerfed for Console Use"".  I wouldn't spend more than $15 for this one.			"

Basically it's an easier, gorier, bit more simplified, modern System Shock 2, which even though it isn't as good as System Shock 2, it's still pretty enjoyable and I recommend it.			"

												The second I started playing this game, I knew that it was special. This game perfectly blends quick responce and beutifuly smooth combat with a suspensful, scarry and well designed atmosphere. The enemys in this game are downright terrifying, and the story is awesome. The game has a linier campain, but is packed full of Bioshock-like RPG elements. The scarres in this game are real, not just popout stuff (although there are quite a few popouts), and it is one of the gorriest games I have ever seen! Even for being about eight years old the graphics are astounding. Like I said, the story is really good, it keeps you going in a great way, something that not a lot of games do. The voice acting is on point, from the chracters you meet, to the audio logs you find in lockers.  If you ever get stuck somewhere you just hold down B and a blue line shows you where to go, and you can check Isaac's commentary/journal if you are still lost. The entire game is in third person, which I did enjoy. This game is so fun, this is something that all gamers should experience.  If I were to rate it, I would totally give it a 10 out of 10, this game is a masterpiece and deserves every bit of the praise and populartiy it gets. If you have the money, buy it.			"

												I passed on buying this game when it first came out because it looked a bit odd. It wound up in my library through a HumbleBundle, and I decided to give it a play. I instantly regretted passing over this game all those years ago. The gameplay is great. Getting used to the control scheme and view point is not automatic, but it quickly becomes second nature. Characters are well thought out, and are developed excellently. Im a big sucker for a good story in video games, and Dead Space absolutely delivers. The story is fleshed out, and develops nicely as the game progresses. The atmosphere is excelent. I cannot stress this enough, the game keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The environment is littered with potential threats, keeping you constantly scanning. The designers didnt stop there though. They paired this trecherous environment with a ""weapon"" collection that some how just never has enough ammo, and a character that just cant ever get his hit points back up to full. Exhaustive scavenging and ammo conservation are essential to success, but then that just loops back to an environment that is trying to kill you 100% of the time. All in all, the game is absolutely amazing, I couldnt get enough of it, and if you dont buy it now, you will forever regret it.			"

But the whole thing REEKS of current survival horror tropes: laughably linear paths (no exploring, too much hand holding), way too much of the dismembering and not enough scaring, and a lazy plot twist/ending that the studio clearly pulled out of their butts.HOWEVER, I've played worse games and it's worth a shot if you liked Resident Evil 5 and 6.

												I would love to say that this game has all you want from a space-bound horror story. That at times it reminded me of System Shock 2. That I would never be able to dream of space without dreaming of this game, but...And this for me is a major but,... but this game is unplayable for Logitech peripheral users, this includes myself (I own a nice shiny G13 gaming keyboard and a H360 headset ). My 1.5 hours in-game were mostly spent watching the intro cutscene (please, no more, I don't need to hear how Issac's ex needs to speak to him, I've heard it too many times now), whilst waiting to see if my changes have stopped the camera panning to the top left, spinning me around and around and around. The final nail is that the game was developed and published by EA, so once you've paid for your shiny game, forget about any support other than transferring your Steam version to Origin for every problem (seriously, I did try asking for help, hoping EA would have improved since being named the worst American company - Consumerist Magazine, but this was their only suggestion each time).Basically, if you own Logitech peripherals or expect support from the developer, don't buy this game.Okay, that's my rant over this game done, thanks for reading.

												I love Dead Space 1 and 2. I first played them on xbox and saw them on sale on steam one day and said ""Hey, why not?"" Well, as for Dead Space 1, this is a bad port. The controls feel really bad on this verison. The camera is floaty and hard to keep steady, and that is on both keyboard and mouse setup as well as a controller setup. Aiming felt really stiff and awkward. Even the visuals seem a bit of a downgrade from the xbox version. I just want to say quickly that Dead Space 2 plays quite well on both keyboard/mouse and controller setups, and also looks better then the console versions. I could barely get that far in the game because of how poorly this version controlled. It's a great game, but it just does not play nearly as well as the xbox verison.			"

												The sound design and weapon design are both top notch but every other part of the game is mediocre to downright bad. The games few high points come in a few clever environmental puzzles and a few fights where you have room to maneuver and aim. Unfortunately, there's a lot of just boring traversal and extremely cramped fights where you just dump ammo to avoid getting stun locked and killed. The story is very poorly written and told, it tries to be immersive but there's just no depth to it and the game tries to pull multiple twists that don't even make sense or carry any weight. The final boss fight might be the most frustrating part of the game as there's a lengthy unskippable cutscene at the start AND an even longer unskippable cutscene if you die. Add to all that, you need to tweak the game to even use the mouse like a mouse and no FoV and the game is exceedingly awkward at times. I played with a controller and the sensitivty was either too high for precision or too low to move and turn efficiently. I didn't feel the game was more suspenseful due to the controls, it just felt poorly made. This was especially prevalent in bossfights and certain sequences when you were grabbed and had to free aim while being jerk around. I died a number of times because both your firing point AND the spot you're shooting are snapping around with no fluidity at all. Certain enemies have animations where they're invincible and you have to wait for them to snap to another animation for them to be vulnerable again which looks awful and is tedious. The only way I would recommend this game is if you absolutely love suspense/horror as everything else it tries to do is done better somewhere else.			"

												Terrible console port unplayable on PC.Even after you fix terrible mouse acceleration (disable V-Sync and force-disable hardware accel. via your mouse drivers) the game still controls terribly (you can look around only when standing still, while moving your view is fixed so you can't navigate through corridors).Not to mention critical bugs - I could not walk through 3rd doors in the game due to invisible wall. I want my 2$ back.			"

												It does not work, my graphics card is too powerful for the game so it runs at higher than 60 fps so some cutscenes don't happen. It is completley game breaking that in first 10 minutes of gameplay, I can't walk through a door that an enemy was supposed to spawn on the other side of. When I locked my FPS to 30 it worked finally but that is unacceptable, a supposed AAA title when ported over shouldn't have these issues. I am very disapointed because I wanted to try Dead Space 2 but from what I have seen this game is complete♥♥♥♥♥♥on PC and I cannot reccomend a game made by developers that make such a shotty product.

												I can't recommend this game. I played it until Chapter 11 when i was trapped inside a room permenantly because i saved at the wrong time. DON'T SAVE WHEN THE SHIP IS COMING INTO THE DOCKING BAY. but i decided to play all the way through it again. My final take. Not good. Same enemies throughtout entire game. they have a total of 7 types if i can remember correctly. These types are made stronger and given a new skin but they don't ever change. All the bosses are the exact same, tentacles and you shoot the yellow parts. If all this wasn't enough the amount of backtracking i had to do is crazy. ITS CRAZY. and last BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST. The end boss was designed by a child. You shoot then walk ten feet, then walk back ten feet. do this two times. then shoot. BG.			"

												Don't get me wrong. This is a decent game, but I find the PC port nearly unplayable. I hope the console versions are better, because it's really worth giving this game a try.The terribly buggy port bothered me a lot during my playthrough, as I found the setting and story interesting overall. I sensed some influence from System Shock, and I was glad to see exploring was rewarded with background information through audio and text logs. However, it was hard to get immersed due to the absurd amount of bugs when playing the game at 60 fps. Sometimes enemies wouldn't spawn (and thereby have you stuck at some levels), or objects such as body bags would start spazzing out, killing an unfortunate character in their way.I eventually attemted playing the game locked at 30 fps, and suddenly the bugs dissappeared. However, it made combat much more ""choppy"" (probably due to the limited fps). For some reason aiming was also a lot slower/worse. Needless to say, playing the game at 30 fps didn't really help make the game feel better. It still felt like an unfinished port.			"

The gameplay is standard for a horror FPS and very linear, however the immersion is so complete you don't notice - like the fact that the UIs for things like inventory, health, etc are integrated into the environment.  The story is genuinely interesting, but the world itself more so.  Highly recommended.			"

												This is a prime example of what happens when developers stop developing for PC and make games targeted for consoles only.  It is a game that wants to be System Shock.  It is filled with all the obligatory suvival horror tropes even down to monsters coming out of walls, harsh shadows, monsters playing dead, and the requisite jump scenes.  What it fails to deliver is gameplay that is actually any fun.  It starts well, and brings in neat features like zero-gravity, time-dilation, and telekinesis.  However, In short order managing those features, and their related resource constraints, becomes just another chore.  All this is even get past the absolute worst part of this game: the nonresponsive controls that just scream ""Nerfed for Console Use"".  I wouldn't spend more than $15 for this one.			"

												Do NOT buy unless you are really really willing to fight the controls. It's a diabolically bad console port that just fails at understanding a mouse. (Even without vsync)The game itself isn't that bad, got all the right aspects of a horror game, just not compiled correctly. The result is a pretty average FPS with about 0 scare value beyond the first 10 minutes. It seems like all the effort went into the intro.Most of the levels suffer millions of go-grabsomething-comeback syndrome, even when you ignore that every level starts and ends on the same tram system used to get around the ship. Also suffers major voice-in-ear syndrome. The lack of variation makes it a very tedious slog to finish.Only buy Dead Space if you're prepared to destroy your wrist and if it's at a rediculous steam sale price.			"

												Disappointingly un-terrifying. After the first couple of fights with a necromorph they stop being scary. Sure there are plenty of jump-scares, but due to the terrible pacing you get desensitized to them pretty quickly. Full of plot-holes, bad characterization, completely unoriginal story…Honestly the best thing about this game was the sound design. The atmospheric bangs and clangs of necromorphs running through vents above you, roaring in the distance, orchestral stings and satisfying gun sounds add a lot to what is otherwise a very bland gaming experience. Unfortunately a lot of the sounds seem to be in low bitrate, which is a shame.It’s also a lot of fun to dismember necromorphs with the plasma cutter. If it wasn’t for the terrible mouse controls I’d be hard pressed not to recommend this game just for that.			"

The better action gameplay is made frustrating by ineffective scares, while nothing in it, save one noteworthy enemy, is ever actually frightening. The story is inititally boring, with plenty of incoherent audio logs, but late in the game briefly coalesces into something interesting before completely collapsing into an insult of an ending.			"

												Avoid the game is not very good. The game is boring and completely fails as a horror game. The plot is a rip off mix of Event Horizon and Aliens. Your time would be better spent just watching those films and save you half of the game play. The most entertaining part of this game is that Issac has his wife working on the ship and all the characters keep telling you that:A: Issac is worriedB: We should feel sorry for him.However, this complete fails as Issac is a mute with a bucket on his head and completely unable to show emoution. I laughed so hard when her fate was shown as the big emoutional scene completely fails. The second game has a short 3 min vid you can sit through which is a catch up of the plot from the first game (a far better use of time than playing through the first game). Still I bought both for £5.			"

												The number of inventory slots you have isn't enough to carry sufficient ammo from one Store to the next. I was running out of my bullet-based guns every time.Also, it seems like they had a real-time inventory just because they could. They don't even let you sprint when using it, so the only time you can use an invntory item is when there aren't enemies around. This means no stasis recharge and no oxygen recharge when you really need it. More realistic you say? It's the lack of realism that makes games fun. Get slashed once and die like you would in real life, then see if you like realism.Almost didn't complete this because the Store is real-time as well, so I couldn't resupply when there were enemies around. Just had to run for it. it means I couldn't complete the last part of the game which required guns, and I had to download an invincibility hack.Well worth its £3.00  =]			"

												1st thing is first: DEAD SPACE IS NOT SCARY!!This has absolutly NOTHING frightening in it, there is no TRUE horror & irrational thinking brought on by the unknown;there are just Jumpshocks after jumpshock after jumpshock after jumpshock after JUMPSHOCKS!!(It's ripping off D00M 3, except your not scared when the monster jump out at you, you're SHOCKed)HOWEVER....Just because this ""survival horror"" game is not scary DOES NOT mean it is a bad game.In fact, it's quite a cool game, with some new mechanics.Like how there is no HUD for the game: everything is shown on Issac's RIG suit, & the occasional screen displayed around his armour.And how the Fact that there is only one WEAPON (Security Pulse Rifle (Aliens rip-off) & all the other weapons are engineering tools.And I DO have to mention the creative ways to kill enemies: The Necromorphs (Aliens ripp-off again) can't be killed by conventional headshots: you have to use your mining tools to cut off their limbs as they do the most damage & inhibit their attacks/movment, which IS admittedly creative. Although, I don't think they're doing anything creative with some enemies having the obvious Lost Planet ""Shoot the glowing orange point for more damage"" parts on monstersAnd the story IS kind of bogus: It isn't THAT original, & all the stuff you think is going to happen happens, they DID get the style (if it DOES exsist) right, as it's ""Generic but everyboy copies it's generic""They DO have some good back story, although you'll need to play the 2nd, worser Dead Space 2 to see it done PROPERLYAlso, is it just me, or does the USG Ishimora (<-bad spelling) look like it was BUILT to look like it's an unpleasent place that has gone to hell even BEFORE the monsters arrive?Because if ALL the elevators were built out of cages & chains to begin with, then it's almost like they're EXPECTING to be attacked..........but that's just me nitpicking.At the end of the day, it is widely agreed that out of the Dead Space series, this one is the best.And I would recommend you get it, but at half-price.It's enjoyable.... but it's not ""the master of sci-fi horror"" that idiots might tell you it is.3/5			"

												Someone please convince me to continue playing this. I know this is considered a horror classic by now, but I just can't go on. I finished the first chapter, but I'm so very bored and uninterested.It seems like a really bad PC port. The camera never shows you the monsters surrounding you and the controls feel incredibly clumsy. It's like after years of evolution in the FPS space, we suddenly decide that it would be 'more challenging' with an eyepatch and our hands tied together.A boring story and hodgepodge of game mechanics, together with the screwed-up controls just result in zero immersion for me.Although I feel a bit better about just putting it down after rewatching the ZP: http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/333-Dead-Space "

												Through out this I am going to make a lot of comparisons to Resident Evil Remake and Alien Isolation, because I want to show you that games made 6 years BEFORE this game and 6 years AFTER this game nailed an oppressive atmosphere with nowhere near the amount of jumpscares as this game. The Spencer Mansion in Resident Evil Remake certainly had scripted jumpscares, the dogs through the window the second time you went through, the zombies through the window, the hunters through the windows. LOADS of windows. But, it still would have a terrifying atmosphere even without those scares. Just the fact that it gave you about a magazine for every 3 zombies and that you could kill about 2 zombies with 1 magazine meant that you had to find your way around zombies, which meant dodging around them or taking a longer but safer route around the mansion. THAT is survival horror. But Dead Space, which clearly takes inspiration from Resident Evil Remake, (because what survival horror doesn't?) doesn't take things like the atmosphere. I mean sure, it has scary moments, even when enemies aren't there, but that's just because I'm afraid something will jump out and a loud musical sting will play. I'm not scared of the ship, or the monsters, I'm scared of the musicians slamming there hands down on the piano again. Alien Isolation, a game that came out in 2014, last year, go 'it'. How to do survival horror without unscripted jumpscares, and having an oppressive atmosphere. The bit when you walk through the synthetic bay, where all the dying 'Working Joe's' go to die. You walk through a corridor with about 10 'Working Joe's' standing idol, and you just know that if you turn your back they'll throttle you, but they don't until 10 minutes later when the game throws 8 shotgun shells, 3 flares, 2 medkits and 6 revolver bullets at you, but that's besides the point.I do not think that this is a bad game, I just don't think it's a good one either. It takes the claustrophobia and 'survival horror' from RE:R and A:I but they seem a lot clumsier here. Sure you may love this game, but I'll stick with the good stuff until EA get this right the fourth time round.			"

												Back when this game was released on consoles, it was considered pretty good. The PC port, however, is another matter. Got this game through Humble Bundle and I must say the PC port is dreadful. Mouse acceleration is awful, had terrible frame drops even on a high end PC to a point where it's almost unplayable. DO NOT buy this, unles you can pick this game for $2... There's plenty of other, much better games of this genre.			"

												First off, bad port, or bad quality control. Whatever you call it. Graphic quality is ok, but♥♥♥♥♥♥poor optimization ruins the game. Still playable though.Control is no good either. You can't possibly remap, in-game, buttons as freely as you want. Your mouse's side buttons can't be mapped. Really unhappy with the awkward button mappings by default either.Game definitely isn't 86/100. 70/100 to be more precise. The good side of the game is the true scare factor.Anyway, worth playing if you like horror game. Well, it's less than a dollar game, after all (humble bundle ahem). If you plan on buying on Steam, buy DEAD SPACE PACK. Trust me, worth it for DS 1 + 2. Too bad DS3 isn't here.			"

												Plays out like Resident Evil 4 in space but with more focus on horror and less QTEs. Scarce ammo, fantastic atmosphere from the amazing sound design & environmental effects, and the isolation & vastness of space fuel this modern survival horror adventure. The most impressive immersion element for me was how they handled the ""HUD""; instead of on-screen indicators, your health bar and energy are on your back with ammo on your gun. The only problems with it are port issues (you need to disable v-sync to use a mouse properly), the funneled levels, and a general lack of difficulty.			"

												Right off the bat I can say this... taking Ridley Scott's Alien, Paul W.S. Anderson's Event Horizon and John Carpenter's The Thing....Slamming them together into one survival horror Sci-Fi game was BRILLIANT!!! Now I will admit that this game was a little bit lacking in subtle undertones in the horror department and was relying more on jump scares  but not all games can be like the early Silent Hill games. However all that is made up by the environment of USG Ishimure and how claustrophobic you feel in its lonely dark corridors. The combat focus of not relying on head shots but instead dismemberment was a very nice touch. This gear shift in tactics makes your choice of weapons to carry very important. In a game like Resident Evil 4 a fully automatic weapon aimed at the head of a zombie will have the same result as a magnum but in Dead Space your fully automatic Pulse Rifle is almost useless against a necromorph and you'll just end up waste ammo. Using ""tools"" were by far the best weapons in the whole game such as the Plasma Cutter or the Ripper which adds to the "" your a engineer on a mining ship"" motif.The story of Issac Clark does seem a bit dull at times but what more do you want from a guy that doesn't talk and only grunts while swinging his arms about or stomping his feet. Now the universe that the game takes place in is outstanding in my opinion since a lot of Sci-Fi aspect are very true. For instance the idea of ""planet cracking"" for resources isn't far from the truth. Some day in the future we will find ourselves mining the stars for ore and metals. These little things in the background of the plot makes the nerd in me giddy. The use of Anti-gravity tech and a ""stasis module"" brings another level of depth to the game play mechanics in the areas of puzzles and combat. By using the Stasis on rushing enemies you can slow them down for a brief moment to tear them apart with your weapon in hand, while the Anti-gravity will allow you to alter parts of the environment around to navigate through obstacles and ferry important items. Even after playing through the game years back I still do enjoy coming back to it ever now and then with a big smile on my face.  So if you like a gore filled Sci-Fi nightmare where you find yourself being spooked by the sounds of tapping on metal or pipes blowing off steam at just the right time where it makes you stain your desk chair with brown goo then pick up a copy of this game, Dim the lights, put on a beef pair of headphones and maybe scotchgard your chair in case you get a bit jumpy from things going BOO!

												I would love to say that this game has all you want from a space-bound horror story. That at times it reminded me of System Shock 2. That I would never be able to dream of space without dreaming of this game, but...And this for me is a major but,... but this game is unplayable for Logitech peripheral users, this includes myself (I own a nice shiny G13 gaming keyboard and a H360 headset ). My 1.5 hours in-game were mostly spent watching the intro cutscene (please, no more, I don't need to hear how Issac's ex needs to speak to him, I've heard it too many times now), whilst waiting to see if my changes have stopped the camera panning to the top left, spinning me around and around and around. The final nail is that the game was developed and published by EA, so once you've paid for your shiny game, forget about any support other than transferring your Steam version to Origin for every problem (seriously, I did try asking for help, hoping EA would have improved since being named the worst American company - Consumerist Magazine, but this was their only suggestion each time).Basically, if you own Logitech peripherals or expect support from the developer, don't buy this game.Okay, that's my rant over this game done, thanks for reading.

												The sound design and weapon design are both top notch but every other part of the game is mediocre to downright bad. The games few high points come in a few clever environmental puzzles and a few fights where you have room to maneuver and aim. Unfortunately, there's a lot of just boring traversal and extremely cramped fights where you just dump ammo to avoid getting stun locked and killed. The story is very poorly written and told, it tries to be immersive but there's just no depth to it and the game tries to pull multiple twists that don't even make sense or carry any weight. The final boss fight might be the most frustrating part of the game as there's a lengthy unskippable cutscene at the start AND an even longer unskippable cutscene if you die. Add to all that, you need to tweak the game to even use the mouse like a mouse and no FoV and the game is exceedingly awkward at times. I played with a controller and the sensitivty was either too high for precision or too low to move and turn efficiently. I didn't feel the game was more suspenseful due to the controls, it just felt poorly made. This was especially prevalent in bossfights and certain sequences when you were grabbed and had to free aim while being jerk around. I died a number of times because both your firing point AND the spot you're shooting are snapping around with no fluidity at all. Certain enemies have animations where they're invincible and you have to wait for them to snap to another animation for them to be vulnerable again which looks awful and is tedious. The only way I would recommend this game is if you absolutely love suspense/horror as everything else it tries to do is done better somewhere else.			"

												I love Dead Space 1 and 2. I first played them on xbox and saw them on sale on steam one day and said ""Hey, why not?"" Well, as for Dead Space 1, this is a bad port. The controls feel really bad on this verison. The camera is floaty and hard to keep steady, and that is on both keyboard and mouse setup as well as a controller setup. Aiming felt really stiff and awkward. Even the visuals seem a bit of a downgrade from the xbox version. I just want to say quickly that Dead Space 2 plays quite well on both keyboard/mouse and controller setups, and also looks better then the console versions. I could barely get that far in the game because of how poorly this version controlled. It's a great game, but it just does not play nearly as well as the xbox verison.			"

Same enemies throughtout entire game. they have a total of 7 types if i can remember correctly. These types are made stronger and given a new skin but they don't ever change. All the bosses are the exact same, tentacles and you shoot the yellow parts. If all this wasn't enough the amount of backtracking i had to do is crazy. ITS CRAZY. and last BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST.

												Have you ever wanted to be in a sci-fi space horror movie? If so, then Dead Space is for you.The best aspects of Dead Space are the sound, music, and overall solitary/frightening mood the game sets. There were several occasions where I found myself turning around because I heard something echoing in the distance… sounding as if it was coming closer. Even the zero gravity heavy steps you take sound fantastic with a hollowed, deep bass sound. When the environment is right and the audio is incredibly well done, you have a great setting for a game.The biggest downside of the game was the linear story line. You get a few options of which upgrades you would like to make to your gear but really, you will only want to use 1 maybe 2 guns as some are very weak and pretty much useless. The character development is bland as well. Do not play Dead Space looking for a great story because you will not find it.The gameplay may also feel stiff at first, even for a third person shooter but it kind of makes sense. You are in a heavy space suit, your mobility should be limited. To counter this, the gun controls are tight and precise. You can really feel the power of them (especially once upgraded).Even with the nearly non-existent story, the environment really immersed me. Play the game, take your time going through it; do not rush it. 8.5/10			"

												Ever felt isolated to the point where insanity and reality merge into one horrifying and unforgiving world?  Dead Space is without doubt one of my favorite games of all time.  It caters to gamers who enjoy the survival horror genre while juxtaposing action and unrelenting gore simultaneously.  Throughout the game, you have numerous tasks which all cater to one overall objective towards the end: escaping the Ishimura mining space ship.  One critical element I enjoy about this game is how physical disgusting the creatures are, ranging from midly grotesque to absolutey aberrant.  Dismembering the creatures is fun especially if you decide to play it on hard difficulty settings.  The harder the difficulty, the more strategic the player has to be when it comes to utilizing health kits, ammunition rounds and even stasis energy packs.  If you want your palms to sweat while being sick to your stomach, then this game is the one for you.  I give this game a 9.8 out of 10 (A+)!Signing Out,ElPresador!			"

												Buy, rent, try, or pass? I'd say this (given what's likely an aged price-tag) is a game to add to most collections. Buy.My one big con for DeadSpace: unresponsive controls.My list of pros: The cinematic quality of the portion I've played is astounding. Nearly unparalleled. I'm almost happy to give up some control responsiveness for how gorgeous and immersive this game is. You have to play it to understand. And if you're the least bit adventurous, in the middle of the night with some nice headphones, in the dark. The jumpscares are great! I think this game made my little brain go ""DIE!DIE!DIE!KILLITWITHFIRE!!!"" more than any other game before it. But lemme say something again, the movement and punch/kick controls are terrible. Like I said, I'm ALMOST happy to give up some control responsiveness, too much was taken away though. But if you sharpen your aim enough, and make those couple of hits you DO have time to get in count, well, you can learn to live with it. It's certainly one of the most sluggish I've ever played.The sound (even if at times predictably string-section-horror-y) and music fit the setting very well. And the visuals, I'm happy to say are impressive in many ways even today, in 2014. Something else worth mentioning is how expertly executed the TOTAL absence of user-interface was in DeadSpace. I absolutely LOVE that everything about the world you're in, must be accessed through the character you inhabit. He has various projectors built into his suit which project the prompts, information, and statistics you would expect to find up front and in your face with this type of game. But here, you see it as your character might, seemingly floating in the air beside your character. As you pan and position your camera angle, the world rotates in a detached way, giving you moments of surreal perspective on what you might look like from someone elses eyes in there, in that dark bloody mess of a futuristic room. The experience is certainly not one I think any mature gamers should miss. This would've INSTANTLY cursed me with nightmares for a month when I was younger.As for the story, replayability, and evolution of the game. I actually haven't played through the entire thing and don't want to misjudge it based only on what I've seen so far between PC and console version. But either way, it has been very good over all and a game I definitely recommend picking up.			"

												I wanted to enjoy this, but the PC port is pretty terrible.30 FPS lock if vsync is on. If vsync is turned off, the game speed is tied to your framerate that is probably soaring in the hundreds. It's playable at 60, though, after you force vsync onto the game through your gpu configuration options.Then it crashes. And crashes. Still crashes. It won't stop crashing. You feel it too, don't you?			"

												I am not really sure why anyone can justify giving this game a positive review. The controls for PC keyboard/mouse interface make this game a totally un-playable experience. If you like playing with controlers then buy the game on XBOX. I bought this game for PC on the foundation that a keyboard and mouse would work with this game. While technically they do ""work"" with the game, they do not work even well at a mediocre level. Simply put: The game is unplayable, unless you are okay using a controller - I am not okay with that. ANOTHER POOR PORT CASH GRAB - STAY AWAY.			"

												The transition of survival horror took the meaning of horror in a different direction, wIth Resident Evil 4, we moved from the overall feeling of dread and suspense in the previous titles, to a more generic jump-scare type of horror (with maybe its exception of regenerators). Resident evil 4 was by no means a horror masterpiece, but it was campy and fun, and its gameplay was fantastically implemented, with set pieces oozing from it's pores to thrill the player.Dead space tried (and failed) in my opinion to bring back any of that tension. Instead we have a linear set of sequences filled with scripted jump scares from monsters overdesigned to look horrific.There's only a few times of note worthy moments in this game. One in particular was when you enter a room full of dead bodies, and later the game loops around to this room, except now it is populated with a monster which can make monsters from corpses. I had never encountered this monster before I found this room the first time. I instinctively dismembered all of the corpses, and when I came back around it paid off, instead of a dozen monsters I only had to deal with one. That was a moment of rewarding the player for actually playing the game in a way a video game should be played, trusting the player to emergent decisions as opposed to leading them down set routes with set expectations of play. It did that moment once.So much potential wasted as well. It would have been a lot better if it was more open, Metroidvania. It had the capacity to do that since we have the floor system. And the scripted jump scares could have been randomised or intellegently coded AI which could determine a best attack when the player is at their weakest.In short, this series is overhyped garbage.

												I passed on buying this game when it first came out because it looked a bit odd. It wound up in my library through a HumbleBundle, and I decided to give it a play. I instantly regretted passing over this game all those years ago. The gameplay is great. Getting used to the control scheme and view point is not automatic, but it quickly becomes second nature. Characters are well thought out, and are developed excellently. Im a big sucker for a good story in video games, and Dead Space absolutely delivers. The story is fleshed out, and develops nicely as the game progresses. The atmosphere is excelent. I cannot stress this enough, the game keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The environment is littered with potential threats, keeping you constantly scanning. The designers didnt stop there though. They paired this trecherous environment with a ""weapon"" collection that some how just never has enough ammo, and a character that just cant ever get his hit points back up to full. Exhaustive scavenging and ammo conservation are essential to success, but then that just loops back to an environment that is trying to kill you 100% of the time. All in all, the game is absolutely amazing, I couldnt get enough of it, and if you dont buy it now, you will forever regret it.			"

												The second I started playing this game, I knew that it was special. This game perfectly blends quick responce and beutifuly smooth combat with a suspensful, scarry and well designed atmosphere. The enemys in this game are downright terrifying, and the story is awesome. The game has a linier campain, but is packed full of Bioshock-like RPG elements. The scarres in this game are real, not just popout stuff (although there are quite a few popouts), and it is one of the gorriest games I have ever seen! Even for being about eight years old the graphics are astounding. Like I said, the story is really good, it keeps you going in a great way, something that not a lot of games do. The voice acting is on point, from the chracters you meet, to the audio logs you find in lockers.  If you ever get stuck somewhere you just hold down B and a blue line shows you where to go, and you can check Isaac's commentary/journal if you are still lost. The entire game is in third person, which I did enjoy. This game is so fun, this is something that all gamers should experience.  If I were to rate it, I would totally give it a 10 out of 10, this game is a masterpiece and deserves every bit of the praise and populartiy it gets. If you have the money, buy it.			"

												Well... was it worth $5? Yes. But not more than that. Sure the violence is over the top, the weapons are unique, and there are a few legitimate scares. But the whole thing REEKS of current survival horror tropes: laughably linear paths (no exploring, too much hand holding), way too much of the dismembering and not enough scaring, and a lazy plot twist/ending that the studio clearly pulled out of their butts.HOWEVER, I've played worse games and it's worth a shot if you liked Resident Evil 5 and 6.

												Worth buying at at least 66% off via my ""Never buy games at full price"" motto and ""Percentage-to-hours"" hypothesis (accounting hours played and enjoyment in regards to the absolute lowest percentage that I would consider buying it at if I suddenly lost the game and had to rebuy it). Pros:The story is incredible: the main protagonist doesn't speak or react to events, so it honestly feels like you're in the seat, which is perfect for a horror/survival shooter like this. The NPCs are vital to the story (there's 4 major ones, and a fifth person who appears every now and then and is a key part in the backstory) and feel realistic, and they add to the game experience unlike many games out there these days. The game's mechanics are timeless and the graphics are splendid, even if the game is generally dark. I felt emotionally attached to this game (more than any other, at least) because of how well the developers created the events in the story; stuff felt like it was happening to me, and that's the sign of a well made game. Save points are everywhere, checkpoints are well placed before major events, stores are crucial to the development of the character, and benches are your best friend who only turns up once a month (or in this case, chapter) but are a blast to hang out with (you upgrade you gear here with power nodes). This game was clearly designed with a lot of thought.Cons:The lack of gamepad mapping was kind of annoying at first, but the controls are still good. Sensitivity is downright poor sometimes, especially with the mouse. The bosses were not hard: the one in the middle or just past the middle was harder than the last one, and took way longer. Ammunition is very important in this game, which made it super annoying that enemies that dropped ammo before would often not the later on in the game it got. The story towards the end felt a little forced, but if it was planned with Dead Space 2 in mind, then it's fine, but it just felt like it happened because they did not want **START OF SPOILER** an unhappy ending **END OF SPOILER**. however this does not affect how I feel about the game. The game had some annoying glitches in it, like getting stuck in places in zero gravity and not being able to get out, and also falling through lifts into space and dying if you were not properly on the lift when you activated it. The machine gun-type weapon you use two times to clear asteroids had bad controlling, but it wasn't hard to beat that bit anyway. There's not much in terms of weapon variation, and you can very easily beat the game by just using a Plasma Cutter, maxing it out with the power nodes in the bench, maxing out your RIG the same way, and buying plasma energy all game.Overall, I give this game a rating of 9/10. You could tell that this game's multiplayer could be incredible if done right, but unfortunately it doesn't come until Dead Space 3 (EDIT: Dead Space 2 has a nice 8 player, 4v4 mode that's actually not too bad). The game's single player is a top 5 best campaign in shooter gaming history, with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Halo, Half-Life and maybe Half-Life 2. The controls on the PC port are pretty unresponsive with the mouse, but with the controller it's basically solved, though there seems to be no remapping, which is off putting to some. Because of this, I got the full experience of this game (dark setting, headset on, XBOX 360 controller) and enjoyed it immensely. Handy tip: when you reach the Target Practice minigame, I have a feeling that if you play it enough, you will not have a credits problem/deficiency for the rest of the game. So when you reach it, play it a lot and you will have all the money you need.			"

												I want to play this game, put at the same time I just can't. The mouse controlls are awful, even though I installed a fix that made it a little better.Also the framerate is a mess. Vsync locks it to 30fps, unlocking it gives me 500+ fps, but with screen tearing and ragdoll physics glitches. One time an army of dead bodies just couldn't stop dancing all over the room, even though I just entered. Locking the framerate in AMD controllpanel to 60fps still in doesn't fix the screen tearing and 60fps makes the mouse movement even worse than when playing unlocked.There all also a lot of bugs, couldn't even walk through a door, so I had to reload my save twice before I got through.

												6/10.  While this game has a good plot, the controls are terrible on PC.  It's hard to aim - in fact, you may as well simply spray as you'll have more luck hitting things - and you have to be in ""aim mode"" to shoot.  If a game designer is going to put ""sights"" on your weapon, they should be accurate. I don't use controllers, as I'm a PC gamer not a console gamer, and so I can only review this based on that factor.  I don't plan to play the second one because of this, even though it came in a bundle.Pros:-Story-LengthCons:-Controls-Weird over the shoulder that's not really over the shoulder third person-Aim is off because of point one and two			"

												This game has a game breaking bug in the first 5min. The game only works if you run it in 30fps with the Vsync on. The problem is that the input lag is so bad when that's on, that it makes it almost unplayable. There are some workarounds apparently, but I worked with it for 2hrs and never got it. Mark it another bad port from EA.			"

												The story isn’t that impressive and I wish the game would have been a bit longer. The game has two major bugs that have to be goggled in order to fix them; otherwise you won’t be able to play properly; especially if you plan to play with a controller. Even with the fix, in occasions you’ll find yourself struggling to aim properly. I would only recommend this game on special and would definitely recommend it if you plan to play Dead Space 2; which by the way was a major improvement in every aspect.			"

												Don't play this game with a full bladder...trust me. So believe it or not, but I've played all the Dead Space games...besides the first one (yes...even the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Wii game) and I always saw people saying, ""The first one is the scariest."" so I was like, ""Okay I got Dead Space 1 during a humble bundle sale 2 years ago, let's try this out."" Oh boy...it's scarier than I thought.The thing about this game is that the atmosphere is so dark and so creepy with the appearance, the background sound, and that fact that it's just you, alone, with these Necro's on this gigantic space ship that it literally gets to you. It gets to you so bad that when a necro pops up you can't help but spaz a bit and pause the game.This is without a doubt a great horror game, plus it's a ton of fun. "

												Is a very fun game but not very horror filled, once you have enough ammo to fight back (Which will happen around the 4 chapter) it becomes a 3rd person shooter, this is not a bad thing, but for sure it makes the game full on action.Pros- great setting- cool art design- interesting story- Enemys are fun to fight at the startCons- Enemys are a bore after awhile- Plasma cutter is really the only weapon you need- Some levels kinda mesh together- Jump scares are really the only scares that they throw at yabut is still very fun 8/10P.S the second one is probly the best, thrid one is full on shooter			"

												Right off the bat I can say this... taking Ridley Scott's Alien, Paul W.S. Anderson's Event Horizon and John Carpenter's The Thing....Slamming them together into one survival horror Sci-Fi game was BRILLIANT!!! Now I will admit that this game was a little bit lacking in subtle undertones in the horror department and was relying more on jump scares  but not all games can be like the early Silent Hill games. However all that is made up by the environment of USG Ishimure and how claustrophobic you feel in its lonely dark corridors. The combat focus of not relying on head shots but instead dismemberment was a very nice touch. This gear shift in tactics makes your choice of weapons to carry very important. In a game like Resident Evil 4 a fully automatic weapon aimed at the head of a zombie will have the same result as a magnum but in Dead Space your fully automatic Pulse Rifle is almost useless against a necromorph and you'll just end up waste ammo. Using ""tools"" were by far the best weapons in the whole game such as the Plasma Cutter or the Ripper which adds to the "" your a engineer on a mining ship"" motif.The story of Issac Clark does seem a bit dull at times but what more do you want from a guy that doesn't talk and only grunts while swinging his arms about or stomping his feet. Now the universe that the game takes place in is outstanding in my opinion since a lot of Sci-Fi aspect are very true. For instance the idea of ""planet cracking"" for resources isn't far from the truth. Some day in the future we will find ourselves mining the stars for ore and metals. These little things in the background of the plot makes the nerd in me giddy. The use of Anti-gravity tech and a ""stasis module"" brings another level of depth to the game play mechanics in the areas of puzzles and combat. By using the Stasis on rushing enemies you can slow them down for a brief moment to tear them apart with your weapon in hand, while the Anti-gravity will allow you to alter parts of the environment around to navigate through obstacles and ferry important items. Even after playing through the game years back I still do enjoy coming back to it ever now and then with a big smile on my face.  So if you like a gore filled Sci-Fi nightmare where you find yourself being spooked by the sounds of tapping on metal or pipes blowing off steam at just the right time where it makes you stain your desk chair with brown goo then pick up a copy of this game, Dim the lights, put on a beef pair of headphones and maybe scotchgard your chair in case you get a bit jumpy from things going BOO!

												Players step into the boots of Isaac Clarke, a systems engineer that's part of the dispatched maintenance crew. Outside of fixing the communications issues, Isaac has a number of reasons for arriving on the Ishimura -- he has a number of friends that are stationed on the ship, including someone very special to him that sends an urgent holovid with a few cryptic messages before she disappears. Unfortunately for Isaac and his crew, shortly after they arrive on board the crippled vessel, all hell breaks loose. Their craft is destroyed, leaving them stranded on the Ishimura. The crew is attacked by nightmarish creatures known as Necromorphs, who kill most of Isaac's team and separate him from the surviving members. Even worse, the ship and its systems have started to be corrupted or are failing thanks to the Necromorphic infestation. It's up to Isaac to wander the halls, search for any friends or survivors that are still alive, and fix as many problems as he can until he can find a way to escape the ship, which can take you 12 or more hours to complete. - Jeff Haynes (ign.com) -			"

												To be short , its a great game if you like space horror.The graphics are awesome the lighting effects are stunning. It has plenty of weapons you can buy or upgrade which is very nice. Upgrades are also applied to armor.1 tip im giving is a little tweak because of the horrid mouse controls ( lag , dead points , low sensitivity ) if you encounter these go to your APP DATA folder C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local\Electronic Arts\Dead Space and open the settings.txt in the bottom line just paste the following :Control.AimAssistEnabled = falseControl.AimingPosition = 0Control.ControllerSensitivity = 2Control.DeadZone = 0Control.FireButtonControls = trueControl.InvertX = falseControl.InvertY = falseControl.MouseAcceleration = 0Control.MouseSensitivity = 2.00000000Control.Shock = trueControls.AcL.X = 0x1104007EControls.AcL.Y = 0x00030008Disable Vsync from nvidia control panel or something else and you're done.The game is straight forward and the story just adds to the atmosphere. With 2.5 hours played i give it a 8/10 i might think higher of it though as i progress.			"

												Below was the first part of my review.  I have since managed to make it into the game.  And while it is still nothing compared to part 2, It is at least worth playing so you can get a little more of the story.  However this one won't be played a second time.   On a lighter note though.  The Leviathan was done very well.Picked up the game because somebody mentioned it was the Alien game we've been waiting for.  If only that were true. Within the first 2 hours of play I was so unimpressed I doubt I will finish the game.  First off I don't know why they made it so you looked like a hunched over monkey when walking.  Second the creatures were not impressive and the weapons were even more lame.  I think I would give the flamethrower the award for most useless weapon of all time in any video game created.   The fights were predictible with little surprise.  Walk 10 feet have something drop down in front of you, shoot the leg and arm and it dies.  Rinse. Repeat.  Another thing,  I don't  understand why people think that just because you paint all the walls with blood it makes the game spooky.  It is very cliche' and not very imaginative.   So I guess what I'm saying is I would not recommend this to anybody unless they were utterly bored and this were free.			"

												3/10, the single most terrible game I've encountered in half decadeTerrible PC port  before loading/starting an actual game, the frame rate on menu is excruciatingly low, and cursor suffers heavy lag. During the game, cursor suffers deadzone and low sensitivity which was made worse by little to no cursor acceleration. Although the issues above are fixable if you are willing to go through series of complex lengthy guides. Still, after manual fix the cursor will ended up 4times more sensitive while running than standing still looking around.Insensitive/irresponsive movements  Character only has 4 directions of movement thus never moves diagonally, he stops & stand still for a brief second when changing from W to D, not to mention that was after you’ve press the key a split second ago.General game design failure  character was “by design” placed to the left corner, blind to attack comes from left, and walks in an unacceptable angle heavy skewed to the right, by the time you get used to it I will point and laugh at you while playing a game superior in every possible way, because anything is the game of the year comparing something like this that dare to muster up the courage and call itself a game.

												This game killed my motherboard. Google it, and you will discover that its common enough issue. Too bad I googled after, not before. So, if your motherboard in older than 3 years, it might be dangerous to play this game. And if you do play, stop after single event of BSOD or sudden loss of image on display. I didnt stop after 2 such events, and after 3rd it was finita - I wasnt able to boot, motherboard stopped beeping and I had to upgrade system in the middle of current war in Ukraine. Not a funny thing to do, considering I might need those money soon to get out of here, in case Putin decides to conquer my region.			"

												This is such a buggy pile of garbage. Nothing works correctly on PC. You need to google for yourself how to fix the mouse because it's just standard that it's broken. You will randomly not be able to walk through open doors because it just broke and you need to reload the game. The camera is TERRIBLE and flies all over the place. This should not have been released for the PC.			"

												When I was a younger and more ignorant person, I looked on the advertisements for Dead Space with holy disdain, distancing myself far away from the gory, horror-filled secular content that I was not accustomed to.My, my. How the times have changed for me.Dead Space is a game in which you play as Isaac Clarke: an engineer who was assigned with a small crew to investigate the mysterious mining freight, the USG Ishimura. While onboard, they discover the disturbing necromorph creatures have made a new home amidst the dead bodies and decrepit machinery and have also graciously trapped you onboard to endure with their delightful company.Let me say, the manners of these creatures are atrocious. They don't invite you tea (they don't even have a daily tea), they don't acknowledge you verbally, and most of all they get incredibly intimate with you far too soon to begin any intimate relations in the first place. My stay with them at the Ishimura was atrocious. I'm definitely not going back anytime soon.All bad jokes aside, Dead Space is a damn good looking game. The presentation through the graphical and sound design is fantastic, especially on PC. The ship feels dead, alone, but at the same time writhing with disgusting alien growth always off somewhere in the distance. If it were for the atmosphere and presentation alone, I'd be giving this game a high recommendation.But, alas, far more problems hinder Dead Space from being a fantastic horror experience. For one, the writing's pretty stale. It's not bad. But not really that good either. The majority of the speaking characters are all pretty one-dimensional and not that interesting to talk to. And the story tries to tie such emotional weight for Isaac and his wife, Nicole, but it just isn't there. The main reason behind this failure to feel any emotion with Isaac is that he's a silent protagonist.""But, Double Uppercut, that's a strange criticism for you to make! You like Half-Life and Portal, don't you? They have silent protagonists and they're the best games ever. Why are you hating on Dead Space for having the same thing they have?""Well, you can enjoy cheese but it doens't go good on everything, does it? I dare you to smother some melted cheese all over some ice cream and tell me it's delicious.See, a silent protagonist is supposed to be used purely for player-immersion. If you want to create a character the player can empathize with, they have to speak. I relate to the struggles of Kratos (only in the first God of War) and Joel from the Last of Us, because they're given enough time to have their characters fleshed-out and distinct enough for you to learn who they reall are, as well as care for them. Do I think Gordon Freeman, Chell, or Link are fantastically-written characters? Of course not! They're merely vehicles for the player to immerse themselves in the larger game world. They don't have backstories, and if they do you personally experience it because they ARE you. Isaac feels like a player-driven vehicle, but whenever his wife is thrown into the picture or the question of his insanity is brought up, I feel nothing. I don't know who Isaac is, and I honestly don't care.The gameplay, while pretty fun, is a little clunky too. I'm not a huge fan of how Isaac controls. He tends to walk around a little too awkwardly and the looking around with the mouse is a little too slow. Even when the sensitivity was bumped up, Isaac just wouldn't look around right. On top of that, the game has a weird upgrade-system bolted on that seems to cater more towards an action-focused style of gameplay rather than a horror-focused gameplay. Silent Hill gave you weapons but you didn't have to worry about upgrading them or upgrading your health. It was purely focused on you surviving. While playing Dead Space, I was always thinking about saving money or extra supplies to buy stuff and make Isaac more powerful, which doesn't feed well into that isolated-horror game vibe. It's more of a mechanic for action-focused shooters and fighting games. By the end, I didn't have my metaphorical pants scared off, I felt like a bada**.That's f***ing terrible. EA, you should be ashamed of yourselves.That's just the problem that lies at the heart of Dead Space. It's not that scary. Sure, the monsters are pretty freaky and jump out at inopportune times, but they don't have a lot of presence- ESPECIALLY towards the end of the game when you mow through hordes of necromorphs by the dozens. It's not like Silent Hill where each fight with one of the monsters you'd encounter felt as intimidating as the last, because you never upgraded your character. You always had the same gear and the same health bar. Maybe the designers of Dead Space should have focused on limiting your supplies and making the creatures much tougher to reinforce that horror vibe.And maybe I should stop talking about how much I love Silent Hill during every god**** horror review I write.For what it's worth, Dead Space is a fine game. I think it's pros outweight its cons. The visuals and atmosphere and inventive anti-gravity and space segments really make up for what is otherwise another bland science-fiction horror story. It feels like so many ideas were taken from other horror stories like Alien, The Thing, and even The Shining to some extent. It just doesn't have much to it to really stick with you after you've finished the game. If EA really fleshed out the game by making it more of a horror game than an action game with little horror elements thrown in, this could've been a lot better. But I'm sure people can find some enjoyment in what terror this game provides. However, I think you could play Close Your Eyes for free and it's a much better horror experience than Dead Space. I'm giving it a 5/10. It's a pretty solid game without any defining features to make it fantastically memorable- either as terrible or wonderful. If it intrigues you, go buy it. But if you're looking for something truly frightening, I'd recommend you try out something else.			"

												Apparently some people went on a rampage disliking every negative review. How funny is that?I played Dead Space 3 on Origin before this one.From long menu animations to terrible loading times on low quality. The game just suck in general, so i won't spend time writing a textwall.-High mouse sensitivity in the menu and almost no camera movement in game.-How can visual delay be so high IN THE MAIN MENU?? (v sync was on but seriously even in the main menu where nothing is happening, that delay was unbelievable)-The movement is so bad, i noticed that basic movement is designed this way so the artificial difficulty takes effect and causes those gameplay footage people see on the internet.-Another over-praised console trash badly ported to PC.EDIT: i read other reviews and apparently if you use a controller instead the game works fine.-And if you have V-Sync turned off Doors visually open but physically still closed so the game is unplayable regardless of any other possible reason given.

The door opens, but due to a bug - is still closed.Now, ive read up on the bug and its tied to Vsync apparently, so i decided to turn Vsync on - to fix the problem. Then the game is run in 20fps constant. (and ive got a monster rig. just saying.)So its either 20fps or unable to move into the first frickin room. ALSO, this bug doesnt exist on origin.			"

												TL,DR: The port is awful. If you really need to play this game, do it on console. The game is just worse than RE:4, which also has a better PC port (They’ve updated it).First, I’ll talk about the port, then I’ll talk about the game.The port is awful. With vsync on, the input delay is hilariously bad. With vsync off, the game is extremely unstable. Critical characters will fall through the ground, and you’ll have to reload over and over until you get lucky. Sometimes, especially in the zero G sections, the game gets confused about where you should be, or how you should be standing, and then just gives you and kills you. I’ll falling through the ground multiple times, and there was one section near the end of the game the froze over and over. The mouse support is terrible. The acceleration feels very odd, and even at max sensitivity, I needed to pick up the mouse and swipe several times just to turn 180. I don’t think there have been any graphical improvements over the console version, so you might as well just play that version.The game isn’t great. If you need to scratch that 3rd person “horror” shooter itch, just play RE:4 again. Yeah, the controls are kinda odd, but the mouse actually works properly. Once you get used to the RE:4 controls, they feel much smoother and more responsive than Dead Space’s. Prepare for more unfavorable RE:4 comparisons by the way. The gameplay in RE:4 rarely stops. Yes, there are traditional cutscenes, but they aren’t too frequent. Dead Space doesn’t have traditional cutscenes, but you do get talked at by “support” characters almost constantly, and when you’re being talked at, you can’t run, or open doors, or use save stations. I feel that the game will drop inputs fairly regularly, and movement is annoyingly slow. Dead Space introduces a mechanic in which you can dismember various enemies, but there’s always one correct choice per enemy. For example, a standard zombie is running towards you, cut off the legs, then cut off the arms. It gets quite repetitive. In RE:4, there are time when you might want to go for headshots, or legs shots.Dead Space tries be scary at all times, and I suppose it has a more consistent tone, but I was actually scared less often in this game. It can get scary at a couple moments, in fact, precisely two moments in my opinion, largely owing to the sound design, which is usually good. Most of the enemy design is just a worse version of The Thing (John Carpenter, no one cares about the 50’s version). It’s actually quite odd how inconsistent the quality of the scares are. Sometimes, you hear a terrible sound of anguish, and an odd, strained breath, followed by a vision of a shadow of a strange, once human creature slowly walking around a corner, backlit by a cold, fluorescent light. At other times, you’re locked in some airport terminal waiting room until you kill X number of lame zombie men. There’s an enemy that can regenerate, and you can never kill it, but there very first time it’s introduced, you’re locked in a small room with it, and can get used to how amazingly slow it is. They try to hype up the same monster later on, but you already know just how small of a threat it poses.The world of the game feels like it was design to be open from the beginning, but then some cooperate suit decided that that might confuse people, so they made it linear. Not only is it linear, you have a magic line on the ground that makes sure you never get lost, because it’s not like being lost can be an effective aspect of fear. RE:4 is linear as well, but it feels like it was designed to be linear from the beginning, and it just seems to flow better.Most survival horror games build tension by limiting your ammo and health supplies, but Dead Space doesn’t do that. Instead, your inventory is always full, and you will often need to backtrack to the nearest store to empty it out. You get upgrade materials to improve your armor and weapons, but you get so much cash from selling all that health and ammo you aren’t using that you’ll have everything leveled all the way up by the end. RE:4 gave you too much ammo as well, but cash was limited, and you needed to save up for the guns and upgrade you actually wanted.The story is pretty straight forward, and none of the characters are interesting. RE:4 has a basic story as well, but all the characters are so strong, and the entire narrative is delivered with such camp, that it’s always entertaining. Dead Space treats its story much more seriously, which was a bad idea, because the story is lame and predictable.Story spoilers:  She was dead the whole time.  It was so obvious that I didn’t even realize it was supposed to be a mystery, but they treat the revelation as a grand, Earth shacking reveal. This review is obviously very negative, but the game is more disappointing than really bad. It isn’t as good as RE:4, but the zero G areas are fun (if glitchy). Cutting off limbs is fun at first, and deciding what to upgrade first can be interesting. The scenery changes often enough to stay interesting, even if most of it really doesn’t make sense to be on a space ship.  A couple of the monster designs are quite good. But overall, I would tell you to skip this game unless you are massively into action horror, and have already played RE:4, and F.E.A.R. (the first two), and Condemned (the first one), and Fatal Frame (the first two), and Metro 2033, and a few others that I’m sure I’m, forgetting. "

												I can confirm that this game no longer works ""out of the box"" on the PC.  If you don't have time to go dink around with your graphics card settings for a while (apparently, you want to disable vsync in-game and then fake it out by forcing vsync ON with the control panel for your card... and that still doesn't always work...) you may want to skip this.The severity of the bugs you will encounter, if you encounter them, is surprising, as is how early you encounter them: literally, the third door you can open in the game.  It's pretty ridiculous.  Very bad port. "

												Dead Space is a great example of a game that puts you on egde. It never truly scares you, but it certainly makes you raise your guard constantly knowing that despite your best paranoid efforts, a necromorph will still startle the crap out of you from behind. Being locked in a room with twenty enemies and low ammo certainly puts you through a major stress test.When it comes down to it, I personally believe Dead Space 1 was the pinacle of Dead Space gameplay. Isaac didn't say anything, and the environment fit perfectly in place with what it was supposed to be: An abanadoned, infested space station. Your two allies only called every now and then, so as to not oversaturate the game with dialogue and let you focus on absorbing the atmosphere and enjoying the awesome limb-splattering combat system.The combat system is nearly sheer perfection in terms of feeling. Every shot from most weapons can seriously pack a punch when upgraded, and there is nothing more satisfying than shooting somebody so hard all their limbs fly off or their head explodes. Every enemy was satisfying and fun to fight, with the exception of the f*cking Guardians, which felt like a cheap gimmick at first and always turned into a chore.The story is pretty weak at best. It all comes down to Isaac basically repairing the entire space station then attempting to retrieve ""The Marker"", which he fails at as well. Thankfully, once I really started playing I didn't even care it had a bad story anymore. The gameplay was addictive and multipaced: going from slow to incredibly fastpaced in mere seconds. This more than made up for a horrible story.At the end of the day, the story sucked, but the game was hella fun to play. It's even one of the few games I have fully replayed just for the gameplay, so that should mean something at least. Doom didn't need a good story to be an awesome time blowing off demon and alien limbs, why should Dead Space need a good story too?			"

												Crappiest console port ever. Not playable at all.If you have a somewhat powerful graphics card, it will push the framerate of the game up to levels that somehow cause the framerate dependant physics to break. Unfortunately the incompetent console peasants that made the port couldn't make v-sync work properly either. Solution: run Heaven benchmark on extreme when you need to pass an invisible door so the framerate drops below 30.That's just one example of how poorly this game is made. 0/10 do not buy.			"

I tried everything even running it in compatibilty mode but that made the problem worse! I know the game description does not specifically state the the game has been Windows 8 approved but as with other such game purchases I can get around it by running them in compatibilty mode. EA doesn't offer any suport for a Steam game and  Steam support seems not to care. I have asked for a refund and I am getting the run around. THey got me trying all sorts of fixes but I refuse to be a Beta tester to try to get this game working on Windows 8. So all you other Windows 8 players out there, beware!			"

												I have to say, I am becoming increasingly disappointed with big gaming website critics. They have let me down far too often. This game's praises were sung across all major gaming sites, and yet it's just not that good. Is it beautiful to look at? Sure, but that's about all it has going for it. This game was scary for about the first hour, but after I accumulated a few strong weapons and the ""jump scares"" started becoming repetitive, I was no longer surprised by anything. So maybe the story is where this game shines? Sorry, no. I get the sense that this game's story was trying to be Aliens, but after a couple hours of play, I rarely cared what my next objective was since they were all such mundane meaningless tasks anyway (such as going around an obstruction, or restoring power to some section, etc).Finally there's the combat. While I thoroughly enjoyed the look and feel of the weapons, this game gets sci-fi technology right, the actual combat was mediocre and repetitive. The dismemberment mechanic was a nice touch, but not enough to keep me engaged. So while the major gaming websites gave this game an 8-9/10, I would give it a 6/10.I bought this game on sale along with the second one, so hopefully the sequel will be better.			"

												I enjoyed many of the sci-fi elements of Dead Space. Zipping around in zero gravity and performing repairs on an enormous mining ship were quite fun.That said, I found it impossible to take this game seriously. Its world has no internal logic that I could find. The number of times something happens solely BECAUSE SCARY are too many to count. After the third time I found a can of flamer ammo in a wall box conspicuously labeled ""EMERGENCY SUPPLIES"", it became clear that this was a very traditional survival horror game with a sci-fi coat of paint. Horror games absolutely rely upon your immersion in the gameworld, so constantly breaking my suspension of disbelief by putting momentary thrills ahead of the world-building was a dealbreaker.			"

												Interesting premise, fun story, but the UI is utter crap.  OTS shooters are generally my wheelhouse, but with an untethered camera linked to a mouse control which moves like it's covered in jam, it's possible to get jumped and killed before you can manage to center on your character again.  I tried, honest to Thor I did, but playing a video game version of those dreams where you can't manage to run away from the monsters no matter how hard you try is simply not my cup of tea.			"

												*my review is old and may not reflect the current state of the game, i may be editing or removing this review once i get feedback from someoneRequires you to create a separate Origin account.Was never able to play New Game+ with unlocked stuff due to game bug.Cannot stress enough how big a negative the Origin system is, I also own Dead Space 2 (just check my Steam account) but it disappeared from my Origin account. Trying to reactivate just causes a this code has already been used error, fortunately I had played through it once before it disappeared.Another reason not to get started in the series if you are a single player like me is that Dead Space 3 is Co-op with big chunks of the game locked out for single players.Until EA/Origin goes under and some company that cares about players takes over their IP I cannot recommend their products.

												I wanted to like this game, I really did. At first look it of course reminded me of Doom 3 which i loved. But 5 hours playtime later and i hung it up and never going to pick it up again. The control scheme is the most bass ackward thing ive ever seen for any shooter. It feels like Isaac Clarke is actually a brick that somehow walks around on legs. The mouse lag is horrible and you cant see half the screen because of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ decision to make this an over the shoulder game. Get stuck in a corner after running from something chasing you? Then good luck trying to aim at anything, its just going to zoom in on the back of your head.But hey if you like jumpscares then this game is for you because every enemy is a jumpscare. Necromorphs from the ceiling, necromorphs from the floor, necromorphs from windows. They were scary cause i wasnt expecting it then they just became a nuisance. It makes you want to slow down to a crawl every time you enter a new room just so they cant get the jump on you. Lets leave the lame jumpscares for the devolpers that cant afford to program everything else that makes a good horror game.Edit: dont let the 120 hours fool you, simply left my computer running for a few days			"

												Tedious, relatively boring, pestering, unncessary padding, annoying.edit: (I beat this game with 11 hours in-game time, it wasn't logged because I played it offline. I played the game on medium/normal difficulty.)After hearing so much praise for this game, i'm rather surprised it was incredibly lackluster experience for me. I don't think it's because of having good expectations going in and them not living up to them. It was actually just not that good of a game to me.Dead Space is a game with very cliche story-telling and boring, uninteresting characters who have rather immature fights with each other, and you pretty much just have you shoulder the responsibilites of... everything really. They ask you to do just about everything and spit really menial boring ""story dialouge"" at you that I found myself almost passively ignoring because it was just so bland and uninsprired and typical/predictable. Even then, there was hardly a story to really follow, in the sense of, it was really laid out for you. Incredibly simple.There's a church, they have the ishimura on a illegal planet cracking trip to uncover the marker. Then psychotic ""the church"" people believe the coming of gods new children are here (the necromorphs) and it's time for humanity to die out and be replaced by the necromorphs which are 'better' than humans. It's just so simple and boring and like, it really only took a couple of logs you pick up in the game mid-to-late game to really just lay out the entire story for you in a nutshell. Everything else is focused on 'survival'. Which is really just an extremely unncessary amount of fetch quests, because apparently, for the most part, not a damn thing in the ship almost the entire game takes place works. Every single new chapter is really just these really baseboards characters whining and crying about how nothing works and nothing is simple and how spooked and scared of the necromorphs they are and how they think (x) is dead.I ended up just getting infuriated and annoyed by the story design of essentially doing nothing but fetch quests with no new interesting developments or changes to the story. Like yeah they added new characters, but it was just a guy who was like ""The marker is bad, lets' destroy it or give it back."" and then the crazy church guy who was like ""Humans are weak, necromorphs are gods new children, let them take over.""Woah, totally interesting not cliche boring characters.Then we get to the gameplay. It was easy, very easy. Too much money floating around, the beginning guns are really good (except the assault rifle) and there's no need to change them. There's no tension or fear I felt fighting the enemies. The atmosphere was boring because you quickly just got used to gore and blood be splattered everywhere and seeing nothing but metal walls, the entire atmosphere just got incredibly tasteless and bland. Rarely did a set do anything to set itself apart from other rooms, and I don't count things like the hospital either, that's just a metal room with medical equipment and tools in it.Anyways, how was the gameplay easy? The very first gun you get is basically just god-like and really, really good. Not in the sense from the get-go, but giving it mods and developing the thing just turns it into a killing machine. With plentiful of ammo for it always around, I never felt tension or fear cause bullets for the gun that just quickly kills everything was everywhere. And if it wasn't everywhere? ...you buy it! There's so much money in this game and excess of items, I don't think I used one large medpack in this entire game, I just sold them for credits, and ammo for the line gun (one of the first new guns you can acquire) is quite easy to find and I rarely ever used it. So I could sell off the ammo for it for loads of cash, which in turn can be used to buy modules that allow you to mod you guns and make them EVEN MORE POWERFUL! :DAnd with that, you can increase your health, increase your air-time in space, increase your guns powers, your power to slow-down enemies.You can also buy new suits that allow you to carry more stuff, aka more stuff to sell. There's a lot of money lying around in this game, there's lots of items WORTH a lot of money just lying around. Medpacks are in ample supply. I beat this game using nothing but the first two guns you can acquire and the flame thrower to clean up some of the smaller more simple monsters that I don't want to waste ammo on.And then we get into bad game design. It's incredibly hard not to compare this to resident evil 4 and think about how much wrong there is in this game.The lack of variety in enemies, how easy it is to dispatch them, how the game constantly spams them at you whenever they can.Now, first off. When I say lack of variety in enemies. They really all just look the same, except some of them have tougher skin. The game showed off new enemy types WAY too far late into the game, and by then, they're very easy to kill, and not very interesting either. Really all the enemies are, are just tentacle babies, and floor crawlers, and then your standard guy standing in their legs and with sycthe arms. To kill enemies in this game, you kill them by cutting off their extremities. I just cut off their legs first and then their arms, to basically immobilize them and then easily cut off their arms.I don't care to get too much into that, cause it's really just that. Easily lopping off limbs without much of a sweat. Nothing changed to make it more difficult or interesting or dynamic. It was almost... generic. It like just easy enemies lining up for the headshot except their head is their limbs.The pacing is awful, this game spams enemies at you at every given turn, it's becomes an annoyance. I actually yelled at game game for putting just even more enemies in needless locations. Constantly in tiny rooms, never can go down a big room without some alien attack. It was aggravating and annoying, I couldn't do anything without monsters being there. There's ways to build tension and fear without having boring insessant conflicts all the time. You can't even do the no-gravity space puzzles without being attacked. It's incredibly tiring and annoying.I don't know, this entire game was a disppointment to me. Most of what I did felt like a chore, combat was easy, I felt no fear or tension, the story was elementary, and the characters were faceless contructs that had relatively nothing to contribute to the ""story"" and had I want to say no personality to speak of.Some people may find enjoyment in this game, because they will perhaps just simply enjoy gunning down zombie-like monsters and exploring the (woefully unexciting) ship and space, and that's fine. Plenty of people enjoyed this game clearly. However I found the experience to be a complete letdown and i'm just voicing why I think that it was not good.Regardless, thanks for reading my review. I hope it helped you in your decision to get this game or not. Have a good one.Edit: Also I played this game in its enterity on my xbox 360 controller.			"

It's a real shame considering how much I enjoyed playing dead space 2For one, the mouse controls are broken. For a game that relies on aiming this is incredably dissapointing. Turning off Vsync is the popular solve, however it does not work for everyone (me included) The other option is to use a gamepad, however this is also prone to cause complete crashes that require you to restart your computer.

 The game itself is good, the port is horrible Dead Space is a great game franchise. It had a good story, and the gameplay was great. The port however is really bad. This game should be capped at 30FPS, the game bugs very badly when vsync is disabled and you're around 60FPS+. There will be invisible doors blocking you from progressing, you will get stuck in the floor and die while jumping in 0 gravity mode, and the game will crash intermittently. I suffered through this terrible port to move on to the other two in the franchise.			"

												Very rarely am I unable to tolerate a game. Dead Space is one of them. I don't know if it's just the PC version, but the controls are absolutely unbearable. I knew that things would be bad when the menu was impossible to navigate because of mouse lag, horrendous mouse acceleration, and mouse sensitivity which was difficult to adjust.Just getting the controls to a tolerable state by disabling V-Sync, forcing V-Sync in NVIDIA Control Panel, and adjusting mouse sensitivity in a configuration file was a chore. The worst part is that after all the tweaking, the controls still suck!Isaac moves like an oaf, mouse sensitivity and acceleration changes depending on the X/Y axis and whether or not you're aiming. Combined with the slow, lumbering movements, it really hampers the gameplay.The bottom line is that I can't even play without getting frustrated.			"

												This game is amazing, It knows when to build the atmosphere, it knows when to give you a jump scare, and best of all it made me feel slightly on edge the majority of the time, However the bugs did ruin the mood of the game, at least for me, as for game series so far I've been getting a lot of physics bugs which anything and evrything that you can move will eventually bug out (might tonly be me) but it made the game hilarious. Other than that bug this game is brilliant, the story was good and it made you feel a but for Issac, and the game can be somewhat challenging at times, happly not dark souls challenging but at times you'll run into killy monster things that refuse to die or you run out of ammo, this makes for really run and exciting times, I'd recommend this to anyone! 9/10			"

												I don't understand why this game is well-rated on Steam. Don't get me wrong - Dead Space 1 is a great game on consoles, but on PC, they f**ked the port up in a number of ways.1) Framerate is locked to 30FPS when you have VSYNC enabled in-game2) Keyboard and mouse control is like steering a boat through jelly. Takes a big movement to register anything (seems to have a large 'dead-zone'), and the sensitivity is way down. You will be scrolling your mouse across your whole desk to turn a full circle in-game. If you turn the sensitivity to max, it's slightly better, but then the cursor flies all over the navigation menus. It's crazy.People have written guides on how to attempt to remedy this and some people have good success, those with ATI graphics cards have to do additioanl tweaking to get it working if they can get it working at all. None of this is the point though, you shouldn't have to trawl forums and run through trouble-shooting just to fix something that should have been immediately obvious to the developers in testing - the controls are broken.Either play with a gamepad, or just play this on console - you will have a much simpler-to-enjoy experience either way.

Just starting into the game the feel of it is much more polished than the original. Smoother gameplay, more user friendly controls, and a lot more action packed. This was a interesting game but I cannot say it was a great game. If you skipped this and went straight for dead space 2 I don't think you would have missed much.			"

												i got this game last night, and started playing it today...my first impression of the game was... well i was  very disappointed, i used to love playing dead space on a console, but since i dont have the console anymore i play it on steam, and when i plugged in my xbox controller it was working just fine... but i cant even open the rig without it shutting down again, it opens for a split second then it closes without my chosing to. the mouse cntrols are a joke, given that i move it an inch and its all the way across the screen on low sensitivity... i feel like this port needs to be updated, and updated quick, or i feel a refund request in my future			"

												No matter what I tried, I couldn't get the game to get low enough fps to get past a certain door. There's supposed to be a necromorph eating someone just past the door and if your frames are too high, you get an invisible necromorph that is unpassable and causes you to only be able to play about 15 minutes of the game. Very frustrating, no fix in sight.			"

												If you plan to buy this game, I would implore you to reconsider:I bought this game 2 years ago and have tried to play it on 3 different computers. All of them have above recommended specifications. One computer can handle Fallout 4 and the other two are capable of playing Crysis, Global Offensive and Saints Row 4 all at their highest visual display settings. Two of these computers use AMD chips with AMD GPU and one uses Intel with sufficient HD integrated graphics. Realistically, this game should work on all of these, or at the very least, one of them.I am but one small voice, though. Searching Google for ""Dead Space crashing"" will show you that the amount of the people with this problem is not small. It should be noted that there has been no official attempt by developers to make the game actually compatible. The developers have abandoned creating patches for this game and I don't have any evidence to support that they might resurrect it.This is a great game, but it would seem that if you bought it on PC you wasted your money.

												System used at the time:Intel Core i7 593032GB DDR4-2666Samsung 840 Pro 256GB SSDNvidia Geforce GTX 980Very difficult game to recommend. Story is average, plot twist was a bit predictable, and the controls are infuriating.Graphically it is quite good, particularly for its time.Sound is possibly the best thing about the game, it is very creepy.The worst thing about this game, though, is the autosave. I had one area where I hadn't been able to save for a while, I'd come to an elevator and then a long corridor. I cleared out the enemies, moved on, and then the game has you double back. At this point, an unkillable monster lands right next to you, and the devs figured this is a great point at which to make the game autosave.I had no health left.So I was constantly trying to continue, only to be killed as soon as the game loaded from that autosave. Thankfully, there was one time I managed to spawn early enough before the monster spawned in place, and I escaped and was able to complete the game eventually.The game relies mostly on jump scares, there is very little that you'd actually get freaked out by, besides the jump scares.I found the field of view was awful, and made me feel nauseus quite regularly. The controls were also very poorly set for a PC game, and I don't recall there being a lot of options with regard to key binding.I've heard that Dead Space 2 and 3 brought some significant overhauls to some of the worst points of this game, so they would be more worthy of a purchase than this game, I would say.

												This is a terrible port. First, the game launched at 800x600, and there was immense mouse lag while trying to navigate the menus. Unfortunately, the mouse lag still occurred after fixing the resolution to match my monitor's native resolution. I turned off V-sync, which solved the mouse lag issue, but understandably introduced awful screen tearing. Furthermore, the game does not support 120Hz, so you're pretty much forced to be subjected to the screen tearing. Gameplay-wise, I encountered the invisible door bug that occurs just after gameplay starts, preventing progress.Don't waste your money on this terrible port. Spend it on a non-EA game instead.Ugh.

Bad port & underwhelming gameplayMouse controls are horrible - too slow and sluggish. You can't turn off mouse acceleration.After turning off v-sync and installing Mouse hack and FOV patch it's almost playable but movement still sucks.Has some bugs: graphics (flickering lights), physics (dancing body bags), mouse controls.After the second almost-game breaking bug I deleted it (see below)...Not worth the trouble to me. Horror effect wears off and the rest of the gameplay isn't that great either. Would be somewhat ok without bugs.(1st almost game breaking bug: Chapter 3 tentactle scene sets mouse sensitivity to almost zero - I thought I couldn't aim)(2nd almost game breaking bug: Chapter 5 boss fight scene doesn't start because of disabled v-sync - WTF).

												This game has pretty high moments and stunning views, but it's watered down by long, exhausting sessions where nothing happens and you pretty much just have to run from point A to point B opening your path between hordes of mutant aliens.The story is also quite good, but it's watered by petty tasks, like ""Isaacs! We need to send a message, go to the comm center!""and then ""darn! the comm center is locked! You need to go there to unlock it!"" And then ""ouch! you unlocked it, but nothing works! now you need to push that button to make it work again!!"" and on and on and on...I'd say I recommend it because it's such an iconic game that needs to be played and the high moments are REALLY high... but is it a perfect game? Far from it.			"

												Port Doom 3 to the consoles, then port it back to PC with non-rebindable controls and a laggy mouse, and the result is Dead Space. The game starts out in the survival horror vein, but soon suffers an identity crisis, locking the player in arena-like spaces with dozens of fast moving monsters attacking at once, which is dubious considering that the character is as agile as a pregnant potato and takes up at least a third of the screen. Choosing a third-person perspective for a game with a silent protagonist is another strange design decision that removes any sense of immersion, especially when the character just stands over a dying woman like a manikin with no trace of emotion. Add highly repetitive and mostly predictable gameplay involving completing two to three objectives per level, some of which are recycled later on, and there is no surprise that Doom 3 ends up a far superior game, with near identical visuals and storyline, but no artificial handicaps, better immersion, action, and horror.

												This game is a classic example of a great concept gone horribly wrong.  I really can't understand why Dead Space has gotten such a following.  This game combines a mediocre story and setting with clunky combat, terrible controls, and quite possibly the worst camera angle and FOV in the history of gaming.  Aim mode drops your aim sensitivity so much it's almost impossible to use and even adds joystick deadznoes to the mouse control.  Put this all together and you have the definition of artificial difficulty.It's not even as scary as Doom 3 due to relying entirely on jump scares which the game always warns you about with the music.I'd say the best part of the game are the zero gravity sections which are pretty fun, but even those are severely hampered by the poor camera which makes it difficult to navigate.  Overall, I can't find any way to recommend this game.			"

												Let me preface this by saying that this isn't a bad game. It's just sort of medicore.There is a great deal of attention to detail at the beginning of the game, but you get the feeling that EA contracted these people to develop a game that was longer than it needed to be. A lot of the objectives are pretty much, ""We need to do this one big thing during this chapter, so you need to do this thing 1 and this thing 2 in order to do the big thing."" It wasn't very compelling.The ship itself has a great interior but you don't feel like most of it was meant for people to live on. It is cold and uninviting, which, while forboding, wasn't exactly great at connecting the player to this environment. This detail was better addressed in Dead Space 2.The combat is novel. The problem is that they give you these cool weapons to purchase in the game, but you don't actually need them. I completed the game using nothing but the default weapon.The pacing of the scares was, again, great at the beginning, but became rather predictable the longer you played. It felt like a lot of action and almost no suspense. A detail which was also addressed better in Dead Space 2.There was an aggravating bug in one section using zero-G that made my character die immediately. It was made more aggravating because it was a puzzle section and each time I died I had to start over.Don't get me wrong, Dead Space does do some things great that other games don't do very well. The need to conserve ammunition for instance is pretty good and balanced out by the in-game store. It really does have a survival horror feel.Lastly, it runs very well with my Radeon HD 7770 and 2.9 ghz x4.Overall, it's just okay. I had a bit of fun, but it was sort of hampered by a few poor design choices.			"

												I gave this game a negative review simply because of the way it was ported. Don't get me wrong-I don't hate a game just because it is ported. However, it angers me when a game is ported in a terrible way. Right from the start, I noticed the mouse sensitivity was crap. I adjusted it many times, eventually pushing it to the max sensitivity, but I still had to pick up my mouse at least four times to do a full 360. I ended up plugging in my Xbox One controller, which kind of solved the issue. However, I then noticed how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the FOV was, even for a 3rd-person game. I eventually got over it, just to find an invisible door that I can't go through for the life of me, even after trying multiple times. Mind you, this all happened in the course of about 5 minutes, so I alt-F4'ed and never looked back. Worse port than GTA4.			"

												Just as a heads up to potential buyers, if you do not like to fiddle with computer tech stuff, don't try this game. As I write this, I've been stuck for about an hour with one problem after another: Laggy mouse (turn off vsync), mouse sensitivity too low in-game, and normal in menues, and a fabulous Show Stopper Game Destroying bug right at the start of the game, where you are actually stuck and cannot continue the game. An invisible wall prevents you from moving forward. The solution? Well, I googled it, and after a good long while (the official fix on steam did nothing), I found a tip that said to turn on Fraps (!) to lower the framerates. And it worked....!This is 2015, and the game intro screen says the game is from 2008. They have had seven years to fix these annoying and game breaking bugs, and haven't done it. Shame on you EA. My already low opinion of them has become even lower. As for the game content, I expect that to be good. I will continue playing the game. But any immersion will be completely ruined due to the crappy interface. Would I recommend the game? Well, the short answer is ""no"". The long answer can be found above: Don't buy the game unless you are willing to try and overcome these technical problems.After playthrough:After overcoming the initial problems, I discovered that there were more problems later on, linked to vsync, and turning it on and off. And having a mouse where sensitivity could be increased helped against the low mouse speed. The game content? It is excellent, a high quality game experience. For example:- No unnecessary running- Lots of shortcuts after completing an objective- No ""stupid"" deaths, like falling off a ledge- Checkpoints before difficult fights- Creepy atmosphere, good plotAll in all, you can tell that this is a well-thought out game. That people have really worked with the details. It is a little strange to play an FPS game where you can neither duck or jump, but in a way it is relaxing. You know if you can't reach someplace, you're not meant to go there. No invisible walls (except the bugs) to prevent creative players from going where they are not supposed to.Last impression... well, I downloaded and started playing Dead Space 2 just now, and all the issues were fixed. It makes me wonder why they didn't fix this game as well. It's a shame, since it's such a nice game in all aspects except that.			"

And it worked....!This is 2015, and the game intro screen says the game is from 2008. They have had seven years to fix these annoying and game breaking bugs, and haven't done it. Shame on you EA. My already low opinion of them has become even lower. As for the game content, I expect that to be good. I will continue playing the game. But any immersion will be completely ruined due to the crappy interface. Would I recommend the game? Well, the short answer is ""no"". The long answer can be found above: Don't buy the game unless you are willing to try and overcome these technical problems.After playthrough:After overcoming the initial problems, I discovered that there were more problems later on, linked to vsync, and turning it on and off. And having a mouse where sensitivity could be increased helped against the low mouse speed. The game content? It is excellent, a high quality game experience. For example:- No unnecessary running- Lots of shortcuts after completing an objective- No ""stupid"" deaths, like falling off a ledge- Checkpoints before difficult fights- Creepy atmosphere, good plotAll in all, you can tell that this is a well-thought out game. That people have really worked with the details. It is a little strange to play an FPS game where you can neither duck or jump, but in a way it is relaxing. You know if you can't reach someplace, you're not meant to go there. No invisible walls (except the bugs) to prevent creative players from going where they are not supposed to.Last impression... well, I downloaded and started playing Dead Space 2 just now, and all the issues were fixed. It makes me wonder why they didn't fix this game as well. It's a shame, since it's such a nice game in all aspects except that.			"

Meaning you have to move the sticks ~50% for the game to respond. So you have NO acuracy in movement and aiming what so ever and no sense of actual controll, or ""feeling"" if you will..This game wouldn't be worth it even if it was free..Game made 6 years ago... same bugs 2014Very nice, now how do I get my money back?

												Got this game from a friend's humble To sum the game up in a sentence: jumpscares and loud obnoxious noises. The game gets less horror oriented and starts to shift heavily towards combat later on in the game. The combat wasnt much fun for me, either; it gets really annoying rather quickly. I'll admit, though, the game does have some interesting puzzles in it.The only other good things about this game is the atmosphere and graphic deaths (if you're into that sort of thing.)			"

												0/10: This isn't a game, but something to fill your hard drive with.Problem number 1:This game does not run on windows 7(even in compatitblity mode). After 3 minutes you run into a wall which you can't get through.(in other words there is a door you have to get through and you can't becuase there is invisible wall blocking you and there is no way around it) It turns out you need to mess with your graphics card v-sync to fix it, however this did not work at all for me.Problem number 2:The mouse is terrible. It has massive accelerating issues, which make it unplayable(for those of you who don't know this means you basically can't shoot to save your life)So you need a controler to play it.This isn't a game its a joke and your money is better spend elsewhere, like on some trash/rubblish bin bags, becuase you will easly get more ejoyment out of those bags then on this game			"

Okay, so I fixed the glitch....and it has turned my opinion around. I like weird cool science fiction stuff, I like space, I like zombies, and I like aliens. This pretty much takes all of those and rolls them up into one neat big fat game. It doesn't do a terrible job at it, ei-AAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!...sorry, jump scare. So, as I was saying, after I turned on verti-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Okay, okay, sorry...they won't get me a thir-3,000 jump scares laters!So now that I've been sufficiently not really jump scared (I was being sarcastic.) I still enjoy the overall atmosphere and awesome-tude of this game. Really, even the character design when they're out of special helmeted uniforms is fairly creepy, with the completely unrealistic plastic looking graphical faces, etc, etc. Seriously, though...Look. Aliens. Zombies. Alien Zombies. It's a winning combination, and the designs they came up with for the enemies are pretty freakin' spooky. They wiggle and jiggle about and you get to dismember them by stomping on them. I can't complain about that. And for all the weirdyness, the game has held up graphically, as well. My major complaints are mostly based around pacing, which seems so incredibly slow to me as to negate the horror aspects of the game. I get it, you're trying to build some suspense, but sometimes that just goes a bit too far. 7/10 - would have been 8, but I'm easily irritated by stupid glitches that cause a game to be unplayable until they're tweaked. Most people would call this nitpicking, I call it expecting things to work out of the box. Still changed my mind, though. Totally deserves a recommendation.			"

												2 problems in my opinion that make this game unplayable:1) your character takes up at least 25% of the screen. Can't see anything. I almost want to kick my guy out of the way.2) fast computers will make the game run worse. Yip. Controls become almost completely unusable, mouse is unresponsive. Aiming is near impossible. I've seen a bunch of posts online informing of how to 'fix it' which haven't worked. v-sync and upping the mouse sensitivity in config files etc.Unfortunately so far the scariest thing I've witnessed is how difficult it is to get this game running. Should have pirated it.			"

												The main problem with this game is it can't decide wheter it's an action game or a survival horror game. It's not scary enough to be horror, and the combat isn't fun enough to be a good shooter. The PoV is all kinds of messed up, you aren't in first person, which takes it's toll on immersion, and you can't scroll in or out (which is the appeal of third person) and instead you're stuck behind the shoulder. It makes the game clunky to play. "

												Played this on release on PS3, thought I'd get it on PC since it's on sale. Invisible wall within 10 mins of play, and one of the worst ports I have ever played. Refunded.Never thought I'd say this, but;It's better on Console.			"

												Clunky slow a** character control ruins this game. Melee is too long, ""Running"" is slow as hell. Weapon upgrade system painfully slow to get anything decent. Have to run RadeonPro w special settings to get it to run correctly in the first place but causes Outlook and other apps to crash. Not really worth the $4.99 I paid for it. A snappy FPS format instead of this molasses a** over the shoulder bulls**t might have made for a decent game.			"

												Dead Space is a good game as long as you play it on a console. The PC version of the game is unplayable though. There are many workarounds to get it to work but not one worked on my system. In my case I can't get through the very first door. No matter what I tried. I recommend buying the game for console. And if you don't have a console, then simply don't buy it. 10€ for a Game that doesn't run or at best runs only very poorly just ain't worth the money. And yet again, even though all this is known not only to gamers but to Steam too, there is not a single note from Steam that it may not run.			"

												Do not get that game. I saw a few awful ports in my time, with bugs that just shouldn't be there (like Saints Row 2 running too fast or slow if your processor has a different rate than the Xbox one) but it was never just as unplayable as this piece of crap. The mouse feels like you were really drunk, it's nearly impossible to accurately target something. I even went through the menus with the keyboard because it was that awful. Then you turn off vsync and it works as it should, but only in the menu and ingame you hardly turn at all.I have no idea if that game is supposed to be great on console or not, but don't get it for PC, it's a mess. Probably the first time I stopped playing at the first save point.If I bought that thing in a store, it would be the first game ever I'd be bringing back.So not spend money on this. Seriously. I have no idea how much I paid for it as I had it in my library for quite some time, but even if it was 50 cent it would have been too much.			"

												This is one of the most disappointing games I've ever played.  The story and actual function of the game are presumably great, but the way the camera/movement is designed left me feeling nauseous after only about 20 minutes.  I tried to push through, thinking it was temporary but multiple attempts at playing the game resulted in the same effects.  WIth that being said, the game is near-unplayable and after searching the internet, my experience is most definitely not an isolated case.  What could have been a wonderful addition to the horror/sci-fi genre ends up being a large, unplayable mess.			"

												First time I fired it up, played for 10 minutes.  I didn't enjoy it.  Waited a while.  Friend recommended I try it with a controller, so I did.  I lasted another 10 minutes and now I'm done.  I felt like I was fighting the controls instead of playing a game.Edit 20161214: I wrote previous review well over 1 year ago.  I gave the game another chance.  The game plays much better with a Steam Controller to move the camera.  Unfortunately, no more than 5 minutes into the game my character got stuck and I couldn't progress.  I stand by my previous review.  Something very bad happened to the physics engine in the game as well.  I smacked a corpse and it went twisting in the air and bouncing around the room for a few minutes (in the room I was stuck in and couldn't progress).  Do not recommend.			"

												With hard to manage HUDs, clumbsy and drunken-esuq movements, and slowmoving combat movements with fast moving enemies, not recommended. The story is, overall, kind of bland for this setting. With the whole alien virus from an alien planet and government intervention thing and all. There are too many ""battle stratagies"", with stasis mods and the like, but no real time with the players slow movement speed between actions and the enemies fast movement speeds to do anything stratigic with them but unload and hope you hit something. And with intended to be immersive features for 3rd person, it only makes it feel crowded and hard to manage. There are no real actions that help you in combat, such as take over, or crouch. And in order to defeat waves of enemies, you have to maintain the sites with the lock function, but when enemies get too close (which they will on a regular basis) the melee attacks are uncoordinated, clumbsy, and useless unless planned for, which melee attacks are not meant for. Along with confusing, and useless other features, like 3D map overlay, and alternate weapon mods that don't really do anything useful, this game is not recommended, and not the best 3rd person shooter on the market. If your looking for a decent 3rd person with all these problems fixed, try the Mass Effect trilogy.			"

												They say that the best scary movies are the ones were you don't get to see the monsters.  Deadspace took this to heart.  You don't get to see the monsters coming at you.  In fact you don't get to see much of anything at all.  You do however, get to see the back of the main protagonists space suit.  Riveting as that may be to some, I just found it to be very annoying.  Add to that a small degree of input lag and it becomes extremely unimmersive.  He quickly goes from being the player character to an NPC who keeps getting in your way.  Any survival horror that makes you wish for the death of the main character is fundamentally flawed.			"

As much as this game is good and all...I will not support the sale of this game if huge bugs exist.Case and Point : Chapter 8 : When you get back on the Tran the blockades, that prevent you from leaving when you start the tran, will begin to spin and when you get to the other end they will spin once more; however, they get to a position were you cannot get off. This prevents Chapter 8 from EVER GETTING FINISHED. 1) I've tried reloading my save file2) I tried deleting chapter 8 and reverifying game files3) I tried putting DeadSpace on different setting4) I tried using Kinesis on them5) I tried to outjuke the blockades BUT YOU CANT.So yeah. I better see a fix for this chapter specifically within a month. I don't care how long it has been out, when you port games to different systems you are responsible for fixing stuff like this, stuff that is in fact game breaking.			"

												The most boring game I have ever played actually. Your character is so slow it feels like your're walking around in syrup.Extremely easy since you only need to shoot 2 limbs off to kill everything except for certain boss monsters all of which have gigantic shoot here signs. You can raise the difficulty higher, but only after you beat the game once, and quite frankly I would rather jab forks in my leg than play it again.As a horror game is fails miserably in all regards except for maybe the monster design, they look pretty neat.Way too predictable, meaning all of the ""scary oogabooga surprise"" moments get shut down as soon as they happen or even before they get a chance to even do anything. About half way through the game I just kept hoping every chapter was the last one, since I did pay for the damn thing and should at least finish it. The most satisfying moment was uninstalling the game, which is bittersweet since it's still in my library, possibly stuck there forever. Poor Isaac Clarke should have retired long before this game was ever made and been given a wheelchair to give his day to day life a little more speed.			"

												To understand why I am not recommending it, you need to first understand in what time it came out, and what time we are now.It could be safe to say that, while Dead Space did not invent the shock horror genre, it did give it a very strong boost.That said, we are now in a time and year where we've been frequently exposed, if not overexposed, to shock horror and quick scares. Horror in gaming has had to evolve and those that didn't or failed to do so obviously got left behind.With this little bit of perspective, you should understand that Dead Space (at all times I am talking about the first instalment, I haven't tried the sequels yet) no longer offers any real scares any more. Only those not accustomed to this kind of horror would still feel the dread. And quite frankly, that can't be a whole lot of people any more, let alone 'Gamers'.(if you do happen to find that rare person, videotape it. Those tend to be a real hit on Youtube)Everything that this game throws at you feels like it 'once' was scary and impressive. Especially as it, if my knowledge doesn't fail me, came in a time when it did a lot of impressive things. It's visual quality was top notch and people hadn't tired fully yet from QTE's.But that's the thing (and I know I'm harping on it way too much), it just doesn't scare me any more. And you can also see where the concept had it's flaws. Sure, getting grabbed by that huge tentacle and having to timely shoot it's weak spot before it consumes you is a shocker the first time, but when you die... It just starts all over again once you've gotten to that point from your last checkpoint, and the scare factor is completely devoid of it.In fact, because I was playing on the Hard difficulty, I've had to attempt the second encounter of said tentacle for over TWENTY TIMES. This is partly thanks to the fact I was trying to do a Plasma Cutter only run. Suffice to say I was nothing short of annoyed and bored, eventually. Modern games nowadays tend to include some kind of compensation or balancing so the challenge remains fair but largely doable, unless the game's whole deal is to be unfair.And that is why I am not recommending it. Not because it would be bad game, not because it would happen to be unfair or brutal. I simply don't recommend it because it's no longer adhering to the standards of modern Horror. Which is largely to blame for the genre itself evolving and drastically changing recently.If you would get the game, get it for the nostalgia and to understand where the genre 'used to be'.Just don't expect a product that will knock you off your socks.

												I had high hopes for this game, but I couldn't even get it to work correctly.First I had serious mouse lag, so I looked up a fix on google and found that disabling VSync would fix it, and it did. Okay, cool, great...so I get in the game and the controls are awful. I can't move and look at the same time??? What are we trying to replicate the late 80s/early 90s and the plethora of games with awful controls from that time period?! The only way to turn was to completely stop moving, then use your mouse to point in the direction you want to go, then move again. Using WASD + a mouse at the same time is not allowed...roflOk, I thought. Whatever. It's dumb as hell, but maybe I'll get used to it. So I play for about 2 minutes and get to a doorway I can't go through- got the classic ""run in air"" motion. Sigh...so I alt+tab and go to google again, and tried several ""solutions"". None worked.At this point I pretty much said screw it, quit the game and uninstalled. I really don't have the time or patience for this kind of crap anymore. When I install a game, I want to be able to play it...is that too much to ask for? Apparently it is for Dead Space.			"

												It's basically System Shock 2 with Resident Evil 4 style gameplay... only not nearly as good as either. This isn't a bad game by any means, just mediocre. All the ""horrors"" are pretty much just jump scares, which I'm not really into, and they are pretty predictable. The AI being terrible doesn't really help there. It has ""got me"" a couple of times, but mostly it's just boringly linear and predictable. I find the added clanking sounds everywhere to be just annoying as well (not creepy either, you can EASILY tell if it's just background noise or an actual monster by turning); silence would've made the monster sounds way more tensing. Even with all that, and a weapon that mows down enemies, the environment still keeps me at least a little tense, so there's that.The story is... well... it's ok. Only because it's CLEARLY ""inspired"" by System Shock 2 (with a dash of Alien tossed in). And that's kind of a nice way of saying it's almost a ripoff. Though at least they managed to make me care at least a little about a silent protagonist. Unlike ""Goggles"" from SS2, which nobody even knows his name.I found the graphics to be quite good for the time though, and the UI is pretty neat. The textures all look reasonably sharp and it runs perfectly even on my 460. The art direction is pretty uninspired for the most part, however.The upgrade system is interesting as well. The level of customisation is nifty. I dislike how there are empty upgrade nodes though, but whatever. I wonder how many upgrade points you get through the game though. This is all putting aside the fact that it is a mediocre console port. Controls are passable at best, unplayable at worst. The UI controls are even broken beyond belief. You know it's a bad console port when saving is hard because of the controls. Also, the worst vsync integration I have ever seen in a game. Holy cow. Makes the game almost unplayable. If you do buy this, turn it off.Half the ""horror"" in this game is because you are playing a guy who has less agility than a guy in a wheelchair, who walks around like he's in a tank. I very much dislike games that use this scheme (I'm looking at you, Resident Evil 4). There are far better ways to instill fear in the player than to just cripple there movement. Give me some agility and melee capabilities, and up the AI's reaction and speed and you could achieve the same effect, and you have a games that's *gasp* fun to play.I'd say skip it unless it's a genre you are really into (tank control third person ""horror"" game). Even with that, go play System Shock 2 and get over it's old graphics, because it's a far, far better game that defines how you do a space horror game. If this game scares you and System Shock 2 doesn't even phase you then you are quite the simpleton, I'd have to say.			"

WHY DO PEOPLE FIND THIS GARBAGE FUN???????????????????????????OK, got that out of the way.  Now on to my honest, unbiased review.  The game is graphically poor.  The horror is cliche and cheesy.  The story is good, but nothing special.  The combat is simple at best and unremarkable.  What sealed the deal for me is the fact that the game seems so underdeveloped that they couldn't implement a proper movement mode.  When your main character walks/runs anywhere you can barely turn.  When you are stationary your character turns crazy fast.  If you turn down mouse sensitivity you cant aim.  The character animations even clip between movement and turning, it's ridiculous.  Some of the most basic and vital mechanics of the game were so lazily and blatantly looked over that it's extremely sensible that after you see EA developed it you think to yourself;  ""I shoulda known it was EA.""The only excuse this game has is that it's very old and outdated.

												A truly awful game.  The graphics are low res with lack of detail.  The UI with mouse is sluggish, the mouse responsiveness is terrible and leads to the screen swirling all over the place causing eye strain and headaches.  And the gapeplay / narration is terrible.  I got as far as the train tracks where you have to go through a door slamming backward and forward like a guillotine.  The only ""help"" given was that the plasma bolts slow down objects or enemies.  After firing about 30 plasma bolts at the door, it didn't slow down at all.  After guillotining myself in half about ten times, I gave up in frustration.   What a waste of time!			"

												This game really isn't scary. I'm not a big player of horror games, the only other being slender and i freaked my♥♥♥♥♥♥when i played that, but this game just isn't scary. It tries really hard to make an engaging atmosphere which i liked, the audio logs, the text logs but i just never found it eneough to make the game scary. The game also dosn't understand subtlty. Just at the start you think its starting to get scary them oop! 1 million ♥♥♥♥ing monsters and *pop* goes the scary. The controls are also very very irritating and the shooting is irritating. Unplayable with keyboard + mouse. No matter what i did my sensitiviy was too low for moving around and too high for aiming. Then when i got the line gun the game immediatly broke.If your going to buy, buy for the gameplay its ok at best but really not amazing. If your buying for horror value watch the halloween episode of sesame street instead.			"

												This game is unplayable. Its camera and controlling systems are the worst I have ever experienced. On the rating scale from 1 to 5 it's, actually, zero. Thank God I had a huge discount on this.UPDATEDA lot later after uninstalling this I decided to give it another try. I have applied multiple fixes to make this thing behave as it should, only to run into an impassable door at the very beginning that could not be fixed in any way. Crap, total crap.I know there is an interesting and involving story inside, and I'm a fan of exploring abandoned territories, of mysteries, and of investigations of those mysteries with a gun in hand, but all those issues and troubles just kill any expectations and any desire to learn that story. I still advise to avoid this game unless you are very, VERY determined to go it through.			"

												To appropriate a phrase that Pauline Kael used to describe ""Aliens,"" Dead Space is a ""Boo Game.""  It's basically just you wandering around a ship and every few yards or so a monster will pop out and say ""boo!"" over and over and over again.  Occasionally there is a kind of interesting boss fight, but ""boo!"" is like 75% of the game and it gets old really fast.I honestly don't understand why these games are popular.  The controls are sluggish, the action is slow, the gameplay is repetitive, and the levels are mostly just tedious corridors leading to even more corridors without a whole lot of range of movement.  The scarcity of ammo is kind of a nice touch, I guess, as it at least gives the game a more desperate feel and highlights the ""survival"" in survival horror, but that's really the only thing nice that I can think of to say about this game.

												Dead Space has an interesting story, but lacks polish in a lot of other areas. Like so many games, it introduces interesting concepts, only to execute them poorly. For instance, you sever the arms of aliens to kill them. The catch? Mouse control is awful. It requires precise aiming, and you can clearly tell that it's a console port by the way you are moving. In fact, I was forced to disable v-sync to even get the mouse working at all. A lot of other things work poorly, including AA (any type), loading saves (yes, loading saves), and simulated physics. It's also not immersive (probably due to the abundant issues) and therefore not intense/frightening at all.I -might- play this for the story, but with all the other problems, it's really not worth it.

												Ugh, I don't get all the glowing reviews for this one. You walk your slow guy around following the blue lines on the floor. The music gets dramatic! Creeps jump out at you! Kill them, find objective, press E. Then trudge around some more and do it again. That's the game.The combat is pretty mindless. You don't have enough room to find a good tactical angle for shooting; most of the enemies just magically spawn up close right after you trigger some scripted event. Also, your movement speed is very slow and switching from a melee attack to gun takes forever. So it's stressful in that you have to shoot accurately quickly, but there's very little you can do with your positioning.In my five hours, I've yet to have fun or look forward to a new play session, so I'm going to stop now.

That's a pity, cause I wanted to know the first part of story by playing it myself.

												Dead Space:DO NOT BUY.This game is not worth the hassle! If you suffer from motion sickness with certain games, Dead Space is very, very bad! Also, it's a revolting console port. It's a shame because the story is good and so is the combat.Positives:+ The level design is solid, with lots of different areas, including zero gravity sections which can be quite disorienting and parts of the mining ship are not vacuum sealed, so you'll be running on a limited supply of oxygen. + Additional powers are granted by finding advanced scientific modules, which allow you to slow time or use telekinesis on heavy objects. Smart integration throughout the levels.+ Many weapons and upgrades.+ Combat is fast paced and has a sense of urgency to it.+ Diverse alien creatures which keep you intrigued.Mixed:~ Graphics are average.Negatives:- For a horror title it isn't scary at all, despite obvious efforts by developers to implement jump scares, ""eerie music"" (lol) and dark rooms. Only idiots or those who are easily rattled would think otherwise.- I'm getting severe dizziness while playing this game, even up to an hour after exiting. This is the WORST physical symptom I have experienced from a PC game EVER. In 99% of games I'm completely fine and if I do happen to have a minor problem, disabling motion blur fixes any issues - but not in Dead Space. I've downloaded a third party program to try and adjust the FOV, but it didn't help me. The camera angle is completely ♥♥♥♥ed. This is a huge issue which makes the game very difficult to enjoy.- The mouse sensitivity is a nightmare, it is worse than the burning flames of hell. Good luck aiming your gun at all LOL - DISASTER! You need to edit the game files just to fix it, cool.- Encountered a game breaking bug 5 minutes in, where an ""invisible barrier"" stops me from proceeding through an open doorway (apparently it's a glitch with unlimited FPS settings). This is 8 years after Dead Space was released - no patch! Had to tinker with NVIDIA control panel to resolve the issue!- Movement is as slow as a sloth when running, no jumping or crouching controls, very basic. 3/10Lazy developers. If you're not going to make Dead Space properly playable, why even port it to PC? Such good content, but such a broken PC version. Could have been a far better game than it is. GARBAGE!			"

												I can't bring myself to play this game after 7 chapters anymore because it's such a piece of crap. I don't mind stupid runaround quests, i don't even mind it actually has no story at all, i don't usually mind stupid traps sending me back to the checkpoint over and over again, what i do mind though is the combination of all this ♥♥♥♥ in one game creating a huge boring hassle just getting from chapter to chapter.This game tries too hard be like combination of The Thing and Event horizon and whatnot but it fails so bad. The Thing wasn't about tentacly monsters and Event horizon wasn't about being on a spaceship with tentacly monsters so it just doesn't deliver any tension or horror, only cheap predictable ""scares"" and silly tentaclemonsters running around you hoping they catch you in a narrow corridor because if they try to fight you in a more spacious environment you might get some good laughs watching them run around like a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Probably so you could take your time aiming with those weirdly clunky controls trying to figure out where the monster might be since half of your screen is blocked by the dude's back.The absence of story doesn't really help, it just makes it all even more pointless. Yes i know about the logs and whatnot, it's just all really really boring and most of the times nothing happens. Yeah a new bigger tentaclemonster appears because some crazy guy going on about the tentacly children being the successors of humans which are this and that and therefore they deserve to die. And then you go running around picking stuff and putting it on the other side of the deck. That being done by a mute doofy guy, but that's actually nice of the creators to not include any voiceacting to the main character because they realized it would be superpointless since the game has no real story, so they actually saved some money and hopefully used it on charity or something. And that's pretty much it about the ""story"" of this game.I love scifi and horror and i couldn't imagine i wouldn't like a game that is scifi horror, until Dead space.Seriously it's cheap, predictable, it has no story, it has clunky controls and most importantly it tries too hard at being tense that it's just not scary.

												Pros: Memorable, and through Zero G also creative, level design. Atmospheric. Strong attention to detail and vast scope. Lives up to some aspects of its inspirations. Great RPG elements. Dismembering enemies is a cool idea.Cons: Boring and frustrating: shooting/walking/map-reading/etc. Plot is uninteresting. The horror is jumpscare-driven, lacks contrasting ""safe"" times, and doesn't use build-up. Gameplay offers little new and isn't that fun. Terrible control scheme. Character takes up half the screen.My recommendation: If you genuinely think the aforementioned pros outweigh those cons - you can enjoy some of this.			"

												Dead Space shamelessly rips off of far greater games, and oftentimes fails to live up to the games it so desperately tries to imitate. That being said, Dead Space is redeemed by its fantastic combat, pacing, and production values. Overall, Dead Space is a solid title that deserves to be bought when on sale. The major negatives that drag Dead Space down are all tied to its derivative nature. Dead Space attempts to have non-linear metroidvania-style level design, most likely due to classics such as System Shock 2.  Unfortunately, Dead Space does a generally poor job at it. In System Shock 2, the levels were built open for a reason; the Von Braun was built to imitate a lived in space. People who have played System Shock 2 will clearly remember how the decks were divided into sleeping quarters, marketplaces, cargo bays, and other sections that fit together in a plausible way. Dead Space's levels, however, are extremely hublike and repetitive in nature. The areas have no sense of practicality at all, often being a string of bland metal hallways, connecting rooms that are filled with decorative and pointless machinery. Speaking of which, the game's is graphically strong, but aesthetically lacking.  It really feels like the designers based the ship's design off the grungiest parts of Alien and Event Horizon, and the monsters off of the goriest segments of The Thing. The unfortunate part is the lack of discipline involved; the designers simply spammed these incredibly derivative visual designs over everything, but seemed to forget that the goriest parts of The Thing were only scary because they happened sparingly and unexpectedly, and the darker segments of Alien and Event Horizon were only atmospherically suffocating because of the way they contrasted against otherwise sterile environments. And of course, the combat itself does suffer slightly, as it sometimes leans too heavily on classic survival horror titles such as Resident Evil. It can arbitrarily try to make itself clunky, which isn't effective at raising tension, and is only frustrating when paired with the mouse and keyboard. The amazing thing about Dead Space's core mechanics is how they manage to redeem the rest of the experience. Blasting limbs off of enemies is viscerally satisfying, and the major drawbacks of the game feel extraneous to the core experience, which is, once again, fantastic. There aren't that many types of enemy, but each and every one requres a different set of tactics to take down, meaning that the player will constantly have to adapt to mixed hordes of undead. While the game is not nearly as scary as, say, Amnesia or Silent Hill, there is always the tension that comes with being startled or overwhelmed by enemies, and the extra shot of adrenaline is definitely welcome. Overall, Dead Space is a solid 6/10, and deserves to be picked up on sale, along with the vastly superior sequel that refined and nearly perfected the formula.			"

												♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME.I do NOT recommend anyone buy Dead Space on PC.  This game is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ console port.  However, I recommend someone to go ahead and buy it on a console. The story is OK, and it isn't as cliche for a horror/survival game as others that exist. Going back to the main point on why this is a♥♥♥♥♥♥port there are terrible controls and rampant bugs throughout this game.The controls are terrible. You will fight the controls more than the necromorphs. Using the keyboard plus mouse on this game will get you killed. You will spend a considerable amount of time even struggling to hit continue on the menu screen because of your mouse speed. You will struggle to turn Issac around as he is getting gang♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by necromorphs, and you will just kill yourself in irl when you try to shoot something with your mouse, the aiming/shooting system is terrible.  I feel like it's talking as much effort to aim/shoot as when I'm trying to get laid.  I tried using v synch and adjusting my mouse/keyboard settings in and out of game to help with the grievances of the controls, but I gave up and tried using an xbox controller. Using an xbox controller it still feels like the controls are a clunky mess and aiming isn't as bad of a problem, but it still annoys me to great lengths. Although, running around using a controller is easier than on my keyboard and I don't hit the wrong buttons as much when I need to use telekinesis.Aside from the controls there a lot of bugs in the game. A lot of these bugs will either prevent you from advancing the story, get you killed randomly, and of course there are random crashes. A few examples of these bugs are such as when  I once got into the store machine to change my suit, but I was stuck in there; the little loading time for Issaac to change his suit never finished and I had to restart my game. Another problem I had was when I was going through the plant..hydroponics area and there was this giant wheel thingy that was electrified. When I was gravity jumping to get back to the kill the Levithan there was a glitch where the wheel thingy would kill me and prevented me from completing the game; I had to restart the game and go through a lot more jumping because of that. In addition to those bugs, in my play time I had quite a few CTDs, and had to go back through a previous level to reach a part of the game where I was before my last CTD happened.  I feared the CTDs more than the necromophs.TLDR Buy this game if you want to torture yourself with terrible controls and if you like Dead Space lore..I dont think this game is actually scary. Dead Space 2 was pretty freaky.Yes, that's right! Thumb me down you butthurt little ♥♥♥♥♥es!			"

												I hated and resented the Dire Straits’ song ‘Money For Nothing’ when it was released in 1985 and I still do. Mind you, I had little time for that kind of rock music back then. Today, I’ve grown to slowly admire the genre. But not this song. Why? Because it blatantly and without apology used a vicious slur against gay men, and did so in a way that was as mainstream as you could get in 1985. It even won Dire Straits some awards for their work.			"

Most of your time is spent trying to orient your view, just so you can see the enemy in the space not occupied by terrrain our your character. It could have been better, but simply isn't. Not worth playing.I gave it a try for just over 2 hours, and now STEAM will not refund my money. Buy something else, I wish I had.			"

Only problem is that Dead Space 1 is quite broken with it's camera. The 3rd person point of view was never my forte; but for it to give the extra issues it does makes it feel like you're playing the game without sight at all.It's an old game, so you can't exactly expect a 5-star rating I guess.

												This is one of those games that really give you a different feel than most. Even though it is not a new game, it makes you play on the edge of your seat. I'll admit that I never played it before, since I was afraid to do so. But I decided to just do it anyway since it was recommended to me. Most games don't get me on edge like Dead Space did. That has to speak for something. If you like Sci-fi movies and games and dig the space horror genre, this is a MUST buy. I sunk 14 hours into it on the first play through, and who knows how many more are coming. That will have to wait until after I play Dead Space 2.It is worth noting that after you beat the game, you get to start over with all of your gear and items + 10 power nodes, 50,000 credits and a level 6 military suit. It also unlocks an even harder difficulty for those of you who like to REALLY feel like the Ishimura could be the death of you. Most games like this don't seem to have much replay value, but I think I will definitely revisit this sometime soon. Do yourself a favor and buy this one			"

												this game is playable at 30 fps but once you get it to 60 throgh your drivers it plays great and feels great.the story isent nearly as great as some make it out to be but it's still fine, all it really does is mix up the gameplay when it starts to get stale, and that's fine because the game that is there is realy very fun. it also progresses rather naturaly with you finding upgrade panels that take up an inventory slot witch really gets annoying when you have 3 of the ♥♥♥♥ing things, and the dismemberment is a wee bit gimicky but ultemetly works well.    this game loves to throw new things at you with zero g and boss like enemys later on, and it's great that there is viriety because sadly it stops getting scary at about the 3 hour mark ( this is coming from a guy who needed to be escorted out a haunted house ) but after that point it becomes about maneging your resorces, and you'll get a ton of them, to much somtimes.     I think this game was made thinking you were going to remain spooked the whole time because it's fairly easy once you understand the basic mechanics and that's not a bad thing I love games that flow at a nice pace and this manages that wounderfly, because of the constant introdution of new mechanics and I love that.this game still holds up great dispite it being an mid gen game because it's amazing prezentation and it's worth any gamers attention even 7 years after launchmust play 8.75/10 could have a better storyedit: the story for the game picks up in the last few chapters and with this I give this game a 9.25/10			"

												Best ""new"" horror franchise? I think so. This game here had me gasping for air and i've seen my fair share of sick♥♥♥♥♥♥(movies like: Inside, High tension, In the mouth of madness, Event horizon, etc). I can't say that this game gave me the ""jump scares"" (although there were some such moments) but i can definitely say that it made me feel uneasy,disturbed, out of breath and overall it created a very unpleasant atmosphere. There were times that i felt like playing the game just to progress story-wise but i kept postponing it because i wasn't willing to undergo the torture. The whole experience felt like a journey towards catharsis through the bowels of hell. Just a word of warning though. Do yourself a favour and play it on HARD for your first playthrough (so that the game isn't demoted to a plain shootfest) with a pair of good headphones in a pitch black room (HD res and all that Jazz is also a must for this). Enjoy!			"

												For a straight console port, Dead Space was surprisingly decent.  The story is very engrossing, which is good for games.  The weapon and character upgrades are somewhat limited but at least the game throws lots of aliens at you to dispense of some ammo.The science-fiction writing here is top notch, but the game suffers from terrible controls that can only be corrected for PC to a certain degree.  The world is also very immersive but the controls unfortunately take some of that away.  If you can live with and work around these control issues, you'll find an excellent shooter with an eerily scary world to march through.But really, upgrade the shiznit out of that plasma gun and it will set you free.

												Dead Space is a game that gave the horror genre a much needed jumpstart. After years of Resident Evil sequels we finally get a well executed space horror game that marries both horror and gore. One of the more amazing things in this game is the clean technical execution at the time. Even today I am rather fond of the look of despair this game has going for it.One thing I do recommend is playing this game with someone in a dark lit room. There is something fantastic about sharing fear, and a good friend sitting with you through Dead Space is a pleasure that is hard to describe.If that doesn't sell you this game, just remember that this game has horrible tentacle babies. Not tentacle gerbils, but tentacle babies. TENTACLE BABIES!			"

												One of my favourite games on PC. Dead Space takes the proven formula of over the shoulder survival horror and takes it further with a rich universe in which the game is set, great combat mechanics and a constant atmosphere of dread and unease with some of the most repulsive and twisted enemies to come out of a horror game (tentacle babies, lol). If you want the best experience make sure you have a 360 controller handy and v-sync disabled. 9/10			"

												Not for the faint of heart, that's for sure. Amazing game, with a fantastic story, and a lovely weapon upgrade system. Also, one of the few FPS games where it ain't all about blowing as many holes in your opponent as possible, you actually have to think about what you're shooting at. Lovely with some originality. Sadly however, they picked up on ""console ghosting"" from the Halo frachise, which is about the only downside I could find to this game - Big downside though.			"

												Kinda spoopy for the first half hour. Ended up with me chasing down the basic enemies like ""Get back here nerd I need someone to bully.""Kinda of easy, to be honest. Hard mode is like normal mode for other Horror games. The basic weapon is the only thing you really need cuz it's so good, and you almost never have to run from a fight unless you're just bored of killing things.You see the plot coming from a mile away and it's pretty tired. Also the monsters are kind of goofy if you can get over the squick factor of a little blood.It's like one of those B-Horror flicks except they spent a lot of money on the monster. Great if you don't take it seriously.			"

												Dead Space is a third-person survival-horror video game. The player takes on the role of an engineer named Isaac Clarke, who battles horrific monsters known as Necromorphs on a deep space mining ship called The USG Ishumura. If your looking for a good horror game and you have not played this one yet look no further. Dead Space will suck you in with its gameplay, setting, story and charathers. You will not be dissapointed. I would like to note that its best to play this title with a controller as there seems to be some mouse control issues though you can try to fix it by going into your Nvidia/AMD control panel and enable V-Sync and Triple Buffering from there and disable the in-game V-Sync as it cuts your monitors refresh rate by half.Overall I its been a long time sience a horror game has hooked me in like Dead Space and is an excelent start to a great franchise :D			"

												This game is really well paced, has an excellent story.  Level design is rarely repetitive, and the areas with zero gravity and no air are some of the most interesting challenges the game provides.  The over the shoulder camera works pretty well for a mechanic that is intended to provoke claustrophobia without making you feel like you have to wrestle with it..    The only real criticism I have for it is due to the way I played it.  I tend to meticulously collect all the loot possible, which doesn't always match the narrative, but if you don't do this then you put yourself at a real disadvantage.  That being said, if you do collect and upgrade regularly then medium difficulty is relatively easy.  I think giant, dangerous spaceship machinery killed me more often then enemies.  It's real fun, completely recommend, especially given that you can get it for free on Origin.			"

This game's greatest accomplishment is that it offers immense immersion, due to the awesome integration of the GUI into the game world itself, instead of the edge of your screen.

												The first time I saw a video about this game it was like some EA guy rambling on about how they had just discovered a new element that allows them to make scary games. ""Scary"" is apparently defined as ""disembodied girl voice singing twinkle twinkle little star"". I kid, though, this game has proven to me that George Lucas was right all along: there really is sound in space. And it's screams. Screams everywhere. Like the screams those Tie Fighters make, only instead of coming from a space ship they're coming from my girly mouth. I haven't been this happy about a game's sound since the time I figured out how to alter a Furby's files (I'm pretty sure Tim still has nightmares about that). Not to spoil anything but the core plot from the game was stolen from that episode of Star Trek The Next Generation where the crew goes out too far into the universe and discovers that their thoughts can make things real, but it's really just all in their heads. I.e., Dead Space is every sci-fi ever.			"

												One of EA's not♥♥♥♥♥♥games. Simple spooky sci-fi story. Very pretty and reasonable length.While I like the game itself, the controls are way worse than I remember. There's some kind of insane in built mouse acceleration that makes aiming nearly impossible. Still looking for a fix for that.The sequel doesn't have the same controls problem.It's free on Origin, I believe. So download that if you don't want to buy it. Or was free for a time, but I hate Origin so 3.99 for a steam copy and the sequel didn't bother me.♥♥♥♥ EA. Dead Space is not bad.Get the sequel if you don't want to get Origin and only want one. Controls are way better there.			"

												This game is pretty awesome. It's like Resident Evil 4 (with better controls) mixed with System Shock mixed with Event Horizon. Your mileage may vary on whether it's scary or not, but it's definitely scarier than the later installments. The story is nothing to write home about and you can probably see one of the major plot twists coming a mile away. This doesn't prevent it from being an enjoyable game though.What DOES prevent it from being a 100% enjoyable game is the fact that it has 'console port' written all over it. The FOV is fairly low as you might expect. There are also quite a few mouse problems, including mouse acceleration that cannot be disabled, lower vertical sensitivity than horizontal, and sensitivity that varies wildly based on your frame rate. Additionally, the in-game Vsync setting is completely ♥♥♥♥ing broken. It locks you to 30 fps and introduces an unplayable amount of input lag.If you have a computer capable of running the game at a consistent 60+ fps (which isn't difficult) I would recommend forcing on Vsync and triple-buffering in your graphics card driver if you have an AMD card or using D3DOverrider if you have an Nvidia card. This will fix the inconsistent sensitivity. If you have a mouse that lets you adjust the DPI separately for each axis you can set the Y axis DPI higher than the X axis DPI to compensate for the Y axis being less sensitive. There's no way I know of to remove the acceleration. The FOV can be increased using Widescreen Fixer but it will make menus farther away from the camera and thus more difficult to read, so you may have to toggle it off periodically.Other than the technical issues I think Dead Space is still a great game and I would definitely recommend it.

												While not a subtle horror experience, as the game boasts, this game does have some good moments. If you want to be scared by it do this: play it with the lights off, or while they're dying. I've been startled, and even totally unnerved. Buy the game, it is worth it. On the outside, Dead Space looks like it relies on cheap scares, and really isn't that scary, but if you get into it, you feel alone. Your team is unreliable for any help, Isaac only speaks in 2 onward, and your only friend is your weapon of choice, mine are mining tools, like the ripper, which works great. The enemies behave like zombies, but not 100%. They walk exclusively in straight lines, and are quicker and cleverer. Being stuck with them is unsettling. But it does feel like Event Horizon. Except the Ishimura isn't evil, the Red Marker is, however. I hope when I finish it, the second is as good, if not better.			"

												I still remember the day Dead Space arrived on XBOX 360 and I picked up my pre-order with excitement. I put that game on and played for a solid 4 hours and quickly understood just how incredible of a game it turned out to be...it was everything we wanted a modern survival horror to be with a new twist to the ""Aim for the Head"" instead bringing ""Strategic Dismemberment"" aiming for the limbs to slow down and eventually kill the monsters stalking and hunting you. I'll never get tired of this game...and yes...it still makes me jump out of my seat.Techinical note....for those using AMD systems you will need to either download Radeon Pro or use the Catalyst to force Triple Buffering w/ V-Sync and then turn off v-sync in-game to get 60fps or else frame rate will suck....a lot			"

												Easily one of my most favorite game series. This game is for players who want a decient scare but are also willing to get immersed in the story. Dead Space is about an engineer named Issac Clark who inspects the USG Ishimura, thinking there's a simple fix he and his crew have to do. Soon after boarding, all hell breaks loose as secrets are revieled and tensions become wavering. Soon after starting this game, you'll want to play it over and over again then going onto the next game. I easily give this game a 9/10; this game is completely bone chilling with its atmosphere, but sometimes has its occasional stupid but hilarious glitch. I recommend this game to all players and should be a must play game.			"

The movement and camera is meant to give a sense of fear and suspense which takes away from the combat making it slow and occasionally clumsy. 3.5 out of 5 stars.			"

												I am personally a fan of the Dead Space series. I could say a lot more, but I started out with Dead Space 2 and it only got me once with a jump scare, and I hadn't played this one until I'd beaten 3, which was a fun game but provided no fear to me at all. This one, I later found out, truly captures a feeling of unease and being on the edge of your seat. The looking and motion is a little slow for my preference, but it helps with giving a feeling of not having complete control over everything. If you want fun and gory action, you can play any game in the series, but if you truly want a dash of actual horror with your good times, then you should get this game.			"

												The biggest compliment that I can give Dead Space is that it gives me an experience akin to watching the Aliens movies, which I love. You play as silent protagonist Isaac Clarke who boards the USG Ishimura in order to discover what has happened on board the ship. THe motivation which drives Isaac further forward is his desire to be reunited with his wife who happens to be on board the Ishimura.Dead Space has a variety of monsters to face and a few distinct and unique ways in which to deal with them thanks to the weapons Isaac has at hand and which are available for him to purchase later in the game. While the weapon choices are fairly limited, the different ways in which they can be used to eliminate your enemies will allow you to have a variety of options in which to play the game.The graphics still hold up and the setting is eerie enough, with the sound effects truly spectacular if you are using a proper sound system or headphones. While the story and characters may not be the strongest, those are not the reasons you play a game like Dead Space. If you are looking for a third person survival shooter to scare the ever-loving crap out of you, I cannot recommend this game highly enough.4.5 out of 5 stars.			"

												For all of you sci-fi thriller lovers this is a perfect choice. It can scare the crap of you at the beginning but later on you should be pleased with a joyful extermination of necromorphs. Zero gravity basketball for the win! :DPS. You have to cap FPS to make this game playable. 60 frames per second is a good choice. If you don't do that the controls will be very clunky and some game events may not fire.

												A game of claustrophobic halls and jump-scares peppered throughout. For some people, the scariest thing is the music, but I'd be lying if I said that everything didn't catch me by surprise every time. The gameplay and story are simple enough, but the delivery is a satisfying 8/10. The atmosphere even reminded me of Super Metroid at times.			"

												Another story-heavy FPS with decent gameplay.  It is legitimately scary in places, though it does rely on the occasional jump scare.  There's also a section at the end (shooting asteroids from a turret) that is infamous for its awfulness, but IIRC, I beat it on the second try (after spending the first try figuring out what the hell was going on), so it's not _that_ bad.  Don't play on Hard on your first try.  It's balanced assuming you can do a New Game+ playthrough with all the upgrades acquired on your first trip through.			"

												I have to admit, I am biased. I love sci-fi, I love action horrors... And Dead Space is an awesome blend of those. I don't really play many horror games per se... But being put to a metal container in the vast depths of space without any chance of immediate escape just has some allure. This game is a horrifying, gory, repelling ugly mess that will just force you to love and hate it at the same time because of all the scares and great moments of satisfaction, like when you clean a room full of necros. It's the only horror game (the first installment and its successors) that has ever compelled me to finish it and suffer through all its gritty atmospheric length. Dead Space is my most favourite horror game.			"

												If you're into games like Resident Evil, Batman Arkham series, or Silent Hill then this game is definitley going to knock your socks off. I'm not usually into this genre but Steam had it on sale for so cheap I couldn't pass it up, I've played it long enough to realize I am hooked. Dead Space is a game you turn all the l ights off put on some headphones and escape into a dark world where you could die at any time. Personally, I play 'ironman' (don't ever save) for that extra edge. This game heavily depends on your reaction time and reflexes because danger could be around any corner or above you, if you're not quick enough or can't decide how to react then you are dead. The story is pretty cool too, I'm only on chapter 6 but I am very interested on where this story is going and then once this is done I'll be going right to Dead Space 2.			"

You will hear screeching, banging, dragging, and other sounds when running through dark hallways. You never know where the enemy is. Definitely the scariest game I have ever played. The campaign is long and filled with different enemies and weapons. You will surely not play the game through in one sitting because this game is so scary you will be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ all over the place.

												In space nobody hears you scream. Get it. And the 2nd one too. (Hands off the 3rd one tho.) The psychological terror and horror of aproaching that seemlesly harmless vent shaft is something every true man must experience. And a true woman. And a true unborn child. Just kidding. The atmosphere is a Dead Space signature and the sound architecture of every level is jaw-dropping. So good, you'd wish it'd be a bit worse. (the screams are loud enough to make you loose your body fluids, yet silent enough to drive you into paranoia, wheter you're starting to imagine things.) Gunplay is hectic, fast but still has a tactic feel to it. (""Aim for the limbs!"" everyone says. Even the f*ckin' art cover)The suit and gun upgrades are somewhat dull, but it's enough to give you the feeling of progression. The main point driving you forward is the story. So the conclusion: A good shooter, a brilliant horror game and a mediocre RPG at once, this game is an ideal way to empty your bladder while having a blast doing it. (Uhm... did I just say that?)[DISCLAIMER: In case my review wasn't obvious enough, this is a truly SCARY game. The ""I'd rather♥♥♥♥♥♥my bed, than leaving it"" type of scary]			"

												Classic that holds up well even  against today's games.  6 years have passed since dead space stepped on the scene showing the survival horror doesn't have to be just zombies or creepy towns.  This game is unapologetically gory but thats just one part of the appeal. Game play is solid witha  dismemberment system that actually will affect your success or failure in the game. The Space in Dead Space is promenent with plenty of sci fi themes mixed in with the horror. The protagonist will work on space drives, traverse zero g sections, have to conserve oxygen in vaccum areas, and gains access to an upgradable aresnal of sci fi weapons that rance from plasmas cutters to energy beams and a lot in between.Dead Space's greatest success is in its truely creepy atmoshpere. Excellent sound design featuring footsteps, indistinct whispering and well done voice logs set the tone. Ligting and startling enemy encounters help to round out this truely  scary experience. Highly reccomended for anyone that has an interest in survival horror/scifi games.  *A note disable the ingame vysnc to unlock the default 30fps game. Forcing vysnc through your gpu drivers will give a preferable 60fps and forcing Anti-Aliasing from gpu drives is also highly reccomended to make this game look its best.			"

												Dead Space is a sci-fi horror game.  If you've ever seen the movie Event Horizon, it has a very similar ""feel"" to it.  The game does have some flaws (some weird V sync issues and the part with the asteroids), but I really like the feeling of dread that the game gives you -- I felt like I never had enough ammo or health to survive.  Some would say that is a poor design choice but it adds to the game in my opinion (you are an abandoned ship in the cold void of space, so it makes sense that there aren't a ton of supplies in the ship).  It's no Cry of Fear, but this game is scary.  Having a Necromorph (or worse, more than one) sprint at you as you fumble with your weapons is a very intense experience.  If you are a fan of sci-fi, horror, or sci-fi horror, Dead Space is worth playing.			"

												A game that perhaps revived and redfined survival horror.  No longer did you follow the typical ""shoot them in the head"", but instead was goaled with dismembering.  Perhaps my favorite horror game to come out in the last six years, it was definitly the best in the series with a A+ ending.  The rest of the series follows up well, however, as it goes on, it loses more of its survival horror and migrates into more of a action game.			"

												It's like Resident Evil, without the mediocrity. You could call it an action horror game, but that would be making Resident Evil look good. It's quite a different experience from your usual action game. It is one of the most atmospheric horror games that I have ever played (next to Silent Hill 1-3). I found myself coming back to this game every day (or should I say night?). It's just that much fun. The only problem I have with it is the repetitive enemies and their character models, but don't let this deter you from getting this game. It's a very satisfying experience that you will enjoy.

												Really fantastic game and great story. If you like horror/thriller genre game this is the game for you. It's filled with jump-scare moments but don't expect the feeling to last the entire game. After a while you get use to the jump-scares and it becomes more a shooter than a horror. Still great game and I highly recommend it!			"

												Very good Survival horror game in a sci fi setting with RPG elements. Good story and very nice has a gameplay which i have yet to see from any other game. I recommend playing this game with a controller. Also, it is free till 30th of April on Origen and has a movie that prequels this game.			"

												this game is gorgeous and is full of beautiful environments and atmosphere.  The HUD is brilliantly designed and really adds to the immersion in the game.  I had a lot of fun.  I also really loved the way the game is divided into chapters.  I found that a chapter (about 1 to 2 hours) was the perfect amount to play after getting off work! also, the weapons are so fun!  8.5/10			"

												So far im liking the game. It is atmospheric, aesthetically stunning, and the combat is fantastic. The sound engine is beautiful, and the music raises the tension dramatically. The one problem with the PC version is the awful AWFUL mouse controls. If you are using a mouse and keyboard, feel free to deduct a 2 or 3 from the score I am giving. I have a wired 360 controller to play with and it is an absolute dream. The game is a stunning achievement regarding the horror franchise and I am happy to recommend it to anyone, with prior warning of the controls			"

												This is a very good game, especially for the first of the series. I highly recommend it. If you like the pair of underwear you are wearing, you will hate this game. If you hate your underwear, you will love this game. In games I usually just run, shoot, and speed through the whole game. After hours of Xbox and 1 hour of this, it still isn't old. This felt like a very long game to me, depending on who you are it should feel the same. There are a few bugs and glitches, but all the ones I have seen didn't affect the game. At times the game may get a bit repetative, but seconds later it gets better.			"

												I love the Dead Space games and if you havn't played it yet i reccommend the 1st game to anyone. It oozes atmosphere and the scare factor is very high as you try to stay alive onboard the USG ISHIMURA. A defo must buy for any fan of horror. What are you waiting for go buy it now its only ten quid!!			"

												This game is really well paced, has an excellent story.  Level design is rarely repetitive, and the areas with zero gravity and no air are some of the most interesting challenges the game provides.  The over the shoulder camera works pretty well for a mechanic that is intended to provoke claustrophobia without making you feel like you have to wrestle with it..    The only real criticism I have for it is due to the way I played it.  I tend to meticulously collect all the loot possible, which doesn't always match the narrative, but if you don't do this then you put yourself at a real disadvantage.  That being said, if you do collect and upgrade regularly then medium difficulty is relatively easy.  I think giant, dangerous spaceship machinery killed me more often then enemies.  It's real fun, completely recommend, especially given that you can get it for free on Origin.			"

												Dead Space the first. If only they made the second as good. Enjoy your laser targets hitting the background and moving on the targets because in Dead Space 2 it becomes much more difficult as it is moved into crosshair mode. I never had any control issues back when I used a R.A.T. 7. I have always liked minimal sensitivity in FPS anyway. I don't find it necessairy to do 1080s. Don't plug joysticks in with mouseplay my Cyborg 3d Gold I would leave plugged in would make my mouse automatically move. A friend told me not to buy it because it was scary. I found it interesting and addicting putting all nightmares aside.			"

												While it fails at being a horror game (the attempts to scare you are laughable at best) it does suceed at being a really well designed, tense action game. You owe it to yourself to at least check out this game to see what it does with the hud. It basically has no hud and everything is shown on the character. The story was also surprisingly interesting as it only started coming up halfway through the game and didn't overstay its welcome. Overall a strong start to a trilogy. I hope the next one improves on the few flaws this one has			"
