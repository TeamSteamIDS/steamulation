YouTube™ Video: Indiebitably - Destiny Warriors: More than likely a scam, definitely a ripoff of Naruto. 

			Views: 1,130		

			I review the game Destiny Warriors and detail some of the very suspicious activities around it and its developers. Original review on...		

Not a well made game at all, a user called HappyPanda calling themself a ""game promotion company"" was handing out free copies of the game code and telling people that they are influential members of the community and would love it if a review was left (edit: somebody accused me of making this review because I was salty I didn't get a code, I was actually one of the people he sent a review code to and I am clearly in no way an influential member of the gaming community and you have never heard of me unless you've killed me repeatedly on another videogame) and that they would be handing out copies of a game called Road Redemption next week. This same ""company"" has left a positive of the review after logging 0.1 hours, basically playing long enough so that steam would allow them to leave a positive review (edit: HappyPanda has mysteriously decided to actually log time into the game after this review came out, almost as if he now realizes having a positive review with between 0-6 minutes played is a dumb move). The review also says ""Seems to be well worth the price so far"" worth what price? He's the ""game promotion company"" handing out free copies of the game so he clearly didn't pay any money for it. The same people that are handing out review copies leaving a positive review is sketchy at best, it seems like a ploy to get positive reviews in at the start to scam people into buying the game. Edit: The user HappyPanda is confirmed to be a dev for Road Redemption (the game they are handing out codes for next week), whether they are a dev for Destiny Warriors I am unsure of but the the fact that they are hiding that they are devs when reaching out to people and calling themselves a ""game promotion company"" just makes it all that sketchier. Onto the game itself: Not good. Storyline: Lazy ripoff of Naruto with cringy dialogue and a ridiculous amount of grammatical errors. In one of the first scenes, you meet one of the characters named Kitt his own name is mispelled everytime he talks while everyone else says it properly, this no longer happens in later scenes, there are constant grammatical issues and entire words missing from the dialogue. The actual story: There is a Kage of the Grass village who sealed rampant beasts inside children (sound familiar? keep reading). Your main character is a slacker/klutz type put in a squad with someone classed as a ""bookworm"" despite him clearly being the strongest and macho-esque one in the squad. There is a girl healer and a male who is LITERALLY classed as ""The Emo"" just so they can have the Sakura-Sasuke relationship thing going on. The first mission as a squad? You must collect a bunch of bells your squad leader has hidden...bells. You could literally be finding ANYTHING but they couldn't be arsed to even change it to something besides bells. Gameplay: Not good, abilities have little or no animations that make no sense to them at all. A ""clone x-tu"" (jutsu but they clearly couldn't even bother to find a new name for it so they just wrote X-tu) is literally just your character walking up to the enemy and attacking it, there is no clone of any sort. A fireball is just a random burst of fire where the enemy is standing. They haven't even programmed in the ability to choose 2 targets on abilities so your 2 target abilities hit random targets, sometimes targets that aren't even alive anymore. Enemies do little to no damage and spend half their turns defending and just dragging the battle out, one mob does about 20 damage when it attacks yet when it poisons a character they take 100+ damage a turn. Oh yeah, your characters start out with an absurd amount of health and level up at an insane rate despite killing the exact same weak enemies. Your main character does around 100 damage with his standard attack, the enemies you encounter at the start have about that much health. The kicker? Your characters do not actually have any weapons equipped when you get them, not even a basic rusty sword or anything which is just plain lazy and makes me wonder what in the hell are they infusing when they use weapon enhancement abilities? The majority of the ablities are lazy renamings (your non-clone clone jutsu also has thunder clone, fire clone, etc. variations) and have animations that don't match them at all. Based on the clips provided on the steam page it appears that even later in the game the damage values barely change if at all.  Overall Impression: Not worth the time, I quit after 40-something minutes because of how bad it was and I was trying to push myself to give an accurate review. Hell, if you really want to try it go contact HappyPanda he'll probably give you a free copy if you say you'll give it a good review.			",206,32,3,31,16,2,28

												Someone please get this company a proof-reader for the script.  Very bland story, but couldn't even enjoy that with all the spelling mistakes and error.  Battle system was alright, though grossly imbalanced hp totals/damage.  Fights took a while, especially when the monsters chose to 'guard' which didn't add any depth to the game - just made the fights longer (monsters doing 20 hp damage attacks on 2000 hp heroes). Music was alright, but I had to uninstall when it wasn't much fun after a while.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In a fantasy world, in order to prevent the dark forces from destroying it, students are taught in numerous combat methods and become ninjas. The story focuses on the four main player characters, who share some rather humorous interactions during the course of their adventure to destroy the numerous bosses (I know its a generic term, but thats basically what they are) to protect the land. Anyway, summary over, on to the review!This game is enjoyable, I will be finishing this game. So, you may be wondering why I am giving this a negative review. Personally, I do not think the game, in it's current state, is publishing worthy. I am not just saying this because it is a RPG Maker Game, I actually am adept at using RPG Maker and applaud the creators of this game for attempting to publish it. So I have some words of advice for the creators of this game. If you are going to post a RPG Maker Game, unless it has custom materials, forget about it. The major let down for me during my playing time is the lack of unique, custom assets. Anyone that has either played to many RPG Maker Games or has used the program itself will not find the use of default materials exciting. I liked the comical aspects of the story and characters, but when compared to other similar games, it is still lacking. I know how hard it is to make a game that can be competitive in this market, but I have high hopes that with some changes, this game could become something. Having created numerous RPG Maker games (none of which I have published/monitized), I know the efforts that go into making one of a large scale. So, to review what I have said concerning what this game needs...-Custom Material is the most important thing. Using a example map with a few small changes isn't going to make it. Also, although sound doesn't seem all to important, the right sounds can make or brake a game. Although some of the sounds work, I would suggest changing up a little for variety.There are some things that I did find interesting, and think is a job well done...-Menus. The menus were actually very nice, well edited and so on. Some of the menu designs look similar/exact to some that I have found online, which is fine, as long as you have recieved proper permissions to use them (if applicable).-Combat system, although not overally so impressed. The combat is a basic sideview battler system, so that does seperate it from the typical first person battle view. Might I ask though, did you create the battle system yourselves, or did you use one of the common online scripts such as Yanfly's Battle System (I hope I named it right, I haven't used RPG Maker in a while, so I have forgotten a lot of the script providers names).In short, the game is not of the level where I think it should be monitized. I have personally created games that are on par or better than this one (based on unique materials, custom scripts, so on), and even those I would not feel confident enough about to publish commercially. I do intend to beat this game, and will most likely enjoy doing so, but overall I cannot approve of this game. I applaud the developers on their work, but this game is just lacks the uniqueness that games like this desperately need.May your adventures be many and always end in reward!-Donoknight, Guildmaster of the Tabletop RPG Gamers LeagueNote to the Developers: If you have any questions concerning my review or need any help concerning the future plans/changes to this game, I am happy to help in whatever way I can to help this game thrive in this competitive market.

												... just why?It's really hard for me to not be bored or annoyed of this game. Despite the fact that it feels like a cheap naruto game, there are so many reasons to lose interest.The mapping looks poorly done in a very short time. Probably a drunk night. Why are there so many chests? Some of them just spawn annoying mobs I cant avoid.Since the enemies level with me there is no reason to fight. But wait! I still have to fight since there are plenty of forced ones I can't avoid or escape. I need several rounds to kill one enemy at my level and have to use a lot of my Chi (Mana) to defeat all before they kill me. Why are there so many fights with more than 3 enemies? It just takes too long for one fight and it feels like it's never going to end.  There is plenty of poisoning, stunning etc. I once forgot to get rid of my poisoning and when I unvoluntarily entered the next fight I had 1 hp. Lucky me. After the mission it's possible to buy equipment for my group. When I go to the shop I have a huge selection of weapons and other stuff. Thats great.. or sorta would be if I can always see which weapons I can really equip. The sword that says ""can be used by almost every one"" just works with 2 of my 5 characters. Since I sometimes only have access to that shop when I am alone in the party I can't even see my teammate's equipment to buy stuff I really need. Luckily that doesn't happen all the time. Still a big bummer.I can save anywhere anytime. Why are there extra safe points in the areas?So many questions.			",343,289,10,100,46,2,42

My full review can be found here.[www.the-backlog.net]Destiny Warriors follows the story of Naruto... Sorry, I mean a group of kids who are training as ninjas. They must complete their missions and report back to their leader. Most of their missions involve tackling the evil ninja rouges (no, not the ninja rogues).Within Destiny Warriors lies a complete disaster of spelling/grammar mistakes (including the previously mentioned ninja rouges) and an annoying battle system. Do you like getting stun locked? How about frozen? Maybe, perhaps, you also like being paralyzed? Well, all three of these do the exact same thing! Oh and enemies absolutely love to spam them too! Don't bother leveling up either, as all this does is make battles even harder. Enemies scale with you as you level (because, as we all know, this is a completely fantastic system that no game should ever use), except for the fact their stat scaling goes up a lot faster than yours and just manages to turn every battle into a complete chore.If you value your sanity stay far away from this game.

												What happens if you gave a 13-year-old addicted to Naruto a RPG-Maker0.2 hours is the most i can force myself to play this. The plot is TOO DAMN SIMILAR TO NARUTO. It's not 'inspired' by Naruto, it's 'Copying' Naruto.In all this 0.2 hours, there's almost no single original stuffs. Monster ravaging the land? Check. One hero that sealed the monsters? Check. Land dedicated to that hero? Check. Main character woke up late? Check. Main character is a teen? Main character given 'starting stuffs' by his mom? Check. Main character's best friend is the intellect type while the character is the power type? Check. Another MC's friend is class clown? Check.And from that point, it's all Naruto. I can easily see who's 'inspired' by who in this game.Who the hell uses Western naming, when the setting is clearly Eastern. You might as well go with painfully cliche eastern name, rather than using western name for a NINJA game. The dialog is painful to read. SINCE WHEN, DOES A INSTRUCTOR, CALLS HIS STUDENT, BRO??!?!?!?!?? REALLYThe plot is a RPG main pillar. Screw that up, and your game is gone.I won't reccomend it to anyone in particular, even Naruto fans.			",134,32,0,31,17,1,8

												Large room for improvement, and when I mean large I mean the Devs should all sit down and talk to eachother about what's necessary to create a game and put it for sale on Steam. It's clear that they put some time in creating it, but the amount of negative things just erases that time put in completly. Let's start with the story, it makes sense even though it's very Naruto-alike (by very Naruto-alike I mean it's actually Naruto but just different names for the characters), with just a bit of creativity you could do something better. The dialogs are down right bad, many grammatical errors , spelling errors, overall poor quality (makes me wonder if they put some 13 year old teenager writing it), once again, with a bit of effort they could have had someone spell-proof the dialogs, and it would have felt better for us players. Then there's the combat, great customization many spells, but what for? Most of the battles are downright unbalanced, most of the spells are either badly scripted/bugged (many of them hit for 1hp) or just useless when compared to others, why not cut the spell list a bit and make sure every single spell is actually useful? Finally the thing that upset me the most, script class exceptions happening in the game, literally in-game errors that caused the game to crash, was this game tested before it was deployed on Steam? Was there a beta version? Did you receive user feedback? I bought an in-game item and was all happy, went to use it and get an error saying basicly that the game wasn't tested enough. This is not admissible, not if you want to charge people for the game.There's much to be done for this game if there's still will to improve, and a good start up point would be to review all the dialogs and remove spelling/grammatical errors and cursing all together, followed by a revamp on the combat system.Overall a mediocre at best RPGMaker game who strived to be good but just couldn't due to basic errors that could have been avoided with a bit more planning. 3/10			",41,6,0,19,1,0,3

												This is what a Naruto inspired rpg would be. Or at least what I think it'd be... until I tried the game myself.Pros: A huge selection of skills, so there are a lot to choose from Decent music. I'm sure it's just a standard rpg-maker music but for me, it's actually pretty nice to listen to Tons of Naruto reference. Cons: A lot of grammatical errors. The devs really need to get someone to proofread this game. Repetitive gameplay. Remember I said earlier that this game was inspired by Naruto? So the kage (head of the village) will give you a mission, along with a pre-determined party member. You completed the mission, got some reward from him and that's it. That's how you spend your day. Money. As you progress in the game, it becomes increasingly easy to get money and during those 4 hours in the game, I've never had any money problem. Unbalanced. My entire party could literally wipe out an entire enemies in one turn without mana (or chi) problem. Just go to the pentagram symbol. Pay 10 golds and voila! No more mana and health problem. Rinse and repeat to grind.   Naruto inspired game? Nah. This game is way too similar to be called ""inspired by"" (Though the devs never mention that). Only with a little bit difference here and then. Bell mission with Kakashi and team 7? Check. The drama between Naruto, Sakura and Sasuke? Check.  Max. By the time you reached lvl 15, he'd stop leveling up. Wait what? No, you didn't hear me wrong. He literally stopped leveling up because by then the game wouldn't be able to handle his power. Hell, I'm not even gonna be surprised if he already awakened his mangekyo. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The makers of this game think best part of jrpgs is combat, which is always the worst part. Endlessly repeating the same things (skills, combos etc) over and over again. Even worse, this game has unseen enemy encounters with those that you can see. Which is pretty idiotic. At some point of the game even normal enemies start to have so much hp that random encounters vs normal enemies last for minutes. And you have to fight them ... a lot. Also 90% of the skills are completely useless. And with enemy hp so high even your best skills dont do enough damage. And at some point enemies will start to stunlock your whole party forever.  Also that genius who thought its a good idea that enemies can spawn from treasure chests should never make games again. Also the other thing about combat later is that only your skills that use TP[TP is another mana, only worse] do any damage. And of those only those that use all your TP (100) at one time. So combat turns into use a potion to get 100 tp, use skill, use potion to get 100 tp etc etc, and the best part is that those skills can even miss, losing all your TP.Also there is no use fighting after one point, because enemies scale with your level. So everytime a random encounter starts you can try to run away, except from chest and visible monster (what the hell?). Most of the time the running away doensnt work and because you cant access menu or load in combat forces you to close the game and when you have to do this all the time, it really buggers your steam friends receiving constant notions that you are playing this awful game. The story is pretty nice (in a so bad dialogue it turns kinda into good way), Naw who am I kidding its bad as hell.And nothing can save it as the abyssmal combat ruins the game. And the last thing, I've never ever wished that game would end more. But no it just keeps going and going, and splitting the party all the time forcing you with horrible party combinations and with less people easier for enemies to stunlock you to death. Theres lots of content that should have been scrapped and even cheap things like big maps with mazes and levers(are there just to make the game longer) that you need to push in correct order which you cant see as theres no map and view distance is too near. All while trying to avoid combat from invisible & visible enemies and saving everytime you open a chest, because if theres combat, you need to restart the game. Example battle I might never win. 5 Enemies vs 1 my hero. They use 3 different stuns (stun, paralyze and ice) If any of them stun me, combat is automatically lost. You can only protect yourself vs stuns with armors that have worse stats and only protect vs 1 effect so no dice there. If I luck through one enemy turn without stunlock, I can use 1 spell, which is my best spell and it does about 500-600 damage, enemies have about 10k-15k health. So 1/10 avoid like the plague.

												Terrible game. Rip off plot from an anime without and credit given.What worse is there are boss fights based in RNG (random number genrators) where the boss will paralize you on his first turn, btw the boss goes first (they always go first), and then whittle you down and you NEVER get to respond. Game ends, mission failed restart to do the same thing. I have beaten Dark souls 1 and 2, (haven't played 3 yet), the witcher on Death March setting, Super Meatboy, battletaoads and just about every old NES and SNES game. I'm 38, I come from a time when games were harder and you often had to retry parts over and over. You either had to learn a pattern or have a stragety going in  My point here? Diffuctly isn't an issue for me, poorly thought out RNG fights are. I tried the same fight about 25x. Also, I tend to over level on school RPG's and RPG Makers games and was about 15 level above where I should have been, and still continued to lose. This is the biggest and simply most unfogiveable of mistakes. Makes the game unplayable. The game has many other flaws, but many games do. I don't write reviews but this game has earned it.

Review - Destiny Warriors RPG""A Naruto-inspired game that features game elements from Dragon Quest and Pokemon.""Destiny Warriors RPG is a turn-based Adventure RPG game made from RPG Maker. It's a Naruto-inspired game mixed with Dragon Quest and Pokemon concepts. I'm quite a fan of RPG Maker games but this one disappointed me the most for quite a lot of reasons. Pros:+ The graphics are okay+ The game is quite cheap+ Has trading cardsCons:- Dialogues have a lot of typos.- The story/plot is terrible. (The story is a naruto rip-off)- Dungeons are poorly-made leading to a very repetitive gameplay. It takes out the player's interest to explore the world (should stick to only one style of dungeon design either random monster encounter or placing actual monsters on the field)- Bad level up system. (Some characters will be used at the latter part of the game and you get to use them at level 5 when all of your characters are already level 10+. Max also gets stuck at level 15.)- Battle System is not balanced. (All your characters have high HP but their attacks just won't get strong. The enemies' HP gets higher but their attacks also don't get stronger at all. Having a higher level only shows that you have high HP and MP)It's hard to make a decent game from RPG Maker that would actually sell because of the lack resources, etc. This game has a lot of potential but seeing the story is nearly similar to Naruto, it actually blew out the whole experience for me. It doesn't mean that if you change some of the terms, it's already a different game especially if it was based on a very well-known game/anime such as Naruto. It's not easy to make a nice and interesting story especially for a game.Anyway, I don't recommend this game to gamers who have played quite a lot of RPG Maker-made games but if you're a Naruto fan and you don't mind a somewhat retelling of the Naruto story under different names, then you can try this game since it's quite cheap.Personal Rating:Gameplay: 5/10 (very repetitive)Story: 4/10 (Nearly same plot as Naruto with a slight few modifications)Music: 6/10 Graphics: 6/10Overall: 5/10			",99,66,2,18,11,3,15

												Wow.. I dont even know where to start with this game... Ok, here's a start: DONT BUY THIS GAME. DONT PLAY THIS GAME. Wanna know why? Keep reading:The story is ""ok"" - at best. And the dialogues are a bit funny, I'll give you that, but lets begin on the CONS:Balancing is stupid. Enemies will always be above your level and strength and can 1-2hit kill you easily. There's a level 50 cap but it doesnt matter if you're grinding and reach max level, cos enemies are STILL GONNA HAVE MORE LEVELS, STRENGTH AND HP OVER YOU AND CAN STILL 1-2HIT KILL YOU.And the design on this game.. GOD, the design! Get this:This game is about Crowd Control abuse. CC them and you can keep hitting them for 20 turns until they die (this is bound to happen a lot). If YOU become target of a CC chain, you lose. Simple as that. And that's pretty much how every boss in this game works. Believe, it's not fun to watch them hit you 5 turns in a row and you cant do anything but watch and die.The spells are all messed up: Spells learned on lvl 20 that cost 100 mana ARE STRONGER THAN SPELLS LEARNED ON LEVEL 45 AND COST 350 MANA. Spells supposed to be of the same element, won't work the same way on an enemy. Example: 3 fire element spells on the SAME enemy can cause: 1 to hit for super effective, 1 to hit for normal damage and 1 will cause enemy to resist it.Oh, and game will force you to play with a set party that it formed on its own. Like throw 4 fire magicians in a dungeon with only fire resistant enemies. The struggle is real, and it happens often on the story line.Whoever made this game should go back to school. SOOOO many typos, bad grammar, lack of proper punctuation, etc. Its trully awful to read it.Game is flooded with items that are very much alike when it comes to its effects. There are potions, ramen, lunch, ninja food, etc. They all heal for %hp or mp and SEVERAL HEAL FOR THE SAME % AS ALL OF THEM. It's just unnecessary to have so many items alike. Loot is totally useless. They are super rare to drop and cant be used for crafting or anything other than sold on the stores, for like 5 bucks. Some items have the same sprite AND description, but are different items!Super easy to break the game: buy a gold boost item, play for a while, get rich and buy everything you'll need for the rest of the game.Bottom line: dont put yourself through this suffering. Dont support this poorly made game. Dont buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Everything wrong with this game can be summarised in one sentence:Extremely $hitty battle system.It's not obvious in the beginning, but once you level up to 20-something, the absolute r3tardedness of it all becomes clear.Some examples of what I mean:1) At level 27, ceteris paribus (i.e. all conditions being equal), your normal attack is 61, versus your enemy's normal attack of 519. This is with the best available gear and maximum power-ups in the form of various item purchases.2) The elemental attacks are frigging meaningless - e.g. you would think a ""flaming rat"" would be immune to fire right? And yes, for some fire attacks they get very little damage. But for a few fire attacks, they receive the same damage as others, and can also suffer from the ""+burn"" status effect - even though the graphics clearly depict them as being already on fire (and their element is fire)! Where's the logic?!3) At the ninja tournament, you are suddenly made to use characters you were not using on a regular basis before. (The game always forcefully assigns characters to you to fight with throughout.) As a result, because these characters were not prepped or appropriately levelled up for the challenge, it is nigh impossible to win the battle using them. You have to be popping +HP pills all the time, and even then it's a huge challenge (you just have to betting on the fact that your opponent won't kill you using one of their specials, which have the potential to wipe you out at one go, since your opponents are several levels higher than you are, and equipped with the best possible gear!!!). Where's the fun in that???4) Normal attacks, which consume no MP and TP, deal WAY more damage than magic/skill attacks. I'm talking figures like 448 (using normal attack) as opposed to 92 (using MP/TP attack). Get lost!!!!!!5) You never ever get a chance to remove status effects like +poison, +blind, +burn, etc because some of your enemies are so fast that their turn keeps coming before you even get a chance to move. This in particular happens during the ninja tournament. So, just wait to die. Kthx.I suspect most of the these problems have to do with the fact that, after you reach a certain level, the game just suddenly starts assigning you enemies that are at least 2-3 levels higher than you. So when you're at level 27 for instance, you could be facing 6 enemies at levels 28, 27, 29, 29, 25, 28 respectively. And yes, it's YOU (one person), versus 6 of them. What the hell.It's a pity because I kind of enjoyed the game in the earlier stages, before it started going completely insane with the battle system. The story was corny, but the narrative and goals were clear, and there were many places and items to explore. (Speaking of which, some of the items were bleedin' USELESS. Once again, you'll only find this out later on in the game when more items start becoming available, and you realise they are 100% redundant. You can't even use many of them during battle. Shan't elaborate because my consternation at this game is growing with every word I type.)So, yeah. I basically wasted my time going this far in this game, because I've concluded that it's impossible to proceed without some extreme hair-tearing and head-banging (against the wall or table) due to the anger and frustration that this game's battle system will induce in you.I should also mention that the English is beyond atrocious. E.g. ""insensitive"" used instead of ""incentive""; ""peak"" used instead of ""pique"", and so on. And you get spellings like ""rouge"" (instead of ""rogue"" - and the wrongly-spelled version appears for the WHOLE game!!!), ""paralized"" (instead of ""paralysed""), etc etc. Very often, the words are spelled like how the game author thinks they are pronounced, instead of what they actually are. He could probably write his own dictionary with the sheer number of words he's re-spelled. And then there's the dialogue - in the beginning of the game it's still quite ok, then suddenly, you start seeing ""f***"" appear everywhere.*shakes head*Forget it. Just forget it.

-Quick Review-Destiny Warriors RPG is an RPG maker game developed by ninjalex and released Sep 11, 2015.-Video Review-


YouTube™ Video: RANT Destiny Warriors RPG Review 

			Views: 329		

			Destiny Warriors is an RPG Maker game developed by Ninjalex, and obviously created in RPG maker studio. The only real driving reason to play an RPG maker game is for the story and as a ""first game...		

-Detailed breakdown review-Story:  The story is straight up stolen from the Anime/Manga Naruto.Gameplay: For the first 4 or 5 hours I actually enjoyed playing the game, but after that I got tired of the mechanics because some skills are unlocked and completely useless. In some parts there is literally only 1 skill that is useful and you need to just keep trying different skills until you find the one you like.Conclusion: This game might appeal to a few specific people, but most should just skip it. There are people who have made better RPG maker games out there. But if you really want to pick up a cheap RPG maker game for steam trading cards go for it.			",141,13,3,13,8,0,23

												Masashi Kishimoto (author of Naruto) called. He would like his godawful story back.I have always been wary about RPG maker games, as the potential for them to be bad is high. And this game? It is just awful.Clearly inspired by the horrible anime that is Naruto, the story revolves around Ninjas going to a ninja academy, passing the test and joining a team. Though, unlike the arbitrary goal of becoming the next ninja bozz, your goal in this game is to merely defeat ""the forces of evil"". And you better believe it.Now, now. I know that RPG maker stories tend to have these cliche stories about defeating evil, collecting crystals, killing the four overlords of whatever and whatnot. Even great game series like Final Fantasy did that so you normally are supposed to turn a blind eye and give the game a chance regardless, but I don't even want to give it the benefit of the doubt because the writing is just that bad right off the bat. Spelling errors, missing punctuation, badly written dialogue that doesn't even make any sense. The text reads as if it was written by a 5th grader with all the amateurish mistakes you could possibly make. I haven't finished the game, but I bet it won't get any better.The character sprites also don't seem to really fit the mood of the game. They are ninjas, yet the protagonist's friend looks like a mage or noble. Even the names don't match the setting. Ever heard of a ninja called Spark? What about J.C? Yes, that's right. The main character is called Jay Cee. I wonder if he will rap his way to Hokage, oh wait, wrong goal.But if neither the story or characters are good, at least the gameplay will be nice, right? Nope, it's your typical Final Fantasy like combat. While that's not bad, it certainly isn't innovative, either. Now RPG Maker games seldom want to be innovative, but they kind of have to be if the story and characters fail to deliver. From what I have seen, some special moves and magic spells even share the same animation. How boring is that? One special move literally looked like the basic attack. How exciting. Did the sprites for the special move get lost or something? Lazy.I know this game is just a buck, but even just that buck could get you better entertainment elsewhere. Do yourself a favor and stay clear of this game.I seldom say this, but even Naruto was better written than this. And I freaking hate Naruto.			",524,210,22,104,97,12,97

												[English Review]What to say about Destiny Warriors: the Way of the Ninja...""Did anyone see a ninja in this game? Let the creator of this game know that this is false advertising!""If it wasn't enough, this game has ridiculous and badly done maps, uncreative names, bad use of graphic and sound resources of RPG Maker.The game has third-party systems, graphics and music ...and there is no credits to anyone in any part of the game!Again, if it wasn't enough, the game is pure plagiarism of the anime Naruto. However not even as a copy the game got to be functional.It has terrible characters, and they do not even have motivation. Outside you will find out fighting several times, without even knowing why!The story of the game, as someone already said, appears to have been written by a 7 years old child... And believe me, I've seen good games made by children that can be better than a lot of games here on Steam.Not to mention the countless programming bugs, bad balanced enemies ... Seriously, you have over 15 spells, and only one of them causes some damage to enemies.Seriously, do not buy this game, even if it is for free. Or even if they pay you, do not play this piece of junk!It is not worth it in any way possible...Oh, and the part of ""over 12 hours of gameplay"", read it as: you will be 5 hours trapped in each puzzle, inside a maze with several forced battles.Resulting in more than 20 hours of torment, because the game does not know when to finish... And, yes, it has a continuation... but I hope it never goes out. But I doubt the efficiency of Steam to know when a game should be published or not.And I ask ... How can someone recommend a game badly made like that?---------------------------------[PT-BR Review]O que dizer sobre Destiny Warriors: the Way of the Ninja...""Alguem viu algum ninja nesse jogo? Avisem ao criador que isso é propaganda enganosa!""Como não bastasse ter mapas ridiculamente malfeitos, nomes sem criatividade, péssimo uso dos recursos graficos e sonoros do RPG Maker.O jogo tem sistemas, gráficos e músicas de terceiros... e não há creditos a ninguem em nenhuma parte do jogo!Como não bastasse, o jogo é um plagio sem tamanho do Anime Naruto. Porém nem como cópia o jogo conseguiu ser funcional.Ele tem pessimos personagens, nem motivação eles tem. Fora que você vai se ver lutando diversas vezes, sem nem saber o porquê!A história do jogo como ja disseram parece ter sido escrita por uma criança de 7 anos... E acreditem, ja ví bons jogos feitos por crianças que conseguem ser melhores que muito jogo aqui no steam.Fora a existência de inumeros bugs de programação, inimigos mal balanceados... sério, você tem mais de 15 magias, e só uma delas causa algum dano ao inimigo.É sério, não comprem esse jogo, nem se ele estiver de graça. Ou melhor, até mesmo se te pagarem, não joguem esse lixo de jogo!Ele não vale a pena em nenhum aspecto...Ah, e quanto a parte do ""mais de 12 horas de gameplay"", leia como: você vai ficar 5 horas preso em cada puzzle, dentro de um labirinto, com inumeras batalhas forçadas.Resultando em mais de 20 horas de tormento, pois o jogo não sabe a hora de terminar... E, sim, ele tem uma continuação... mas espero que ela nunca saia. Mas duvido da eficiencia do Steam em saber quando um jogo deve ou não ser publicado.E pergunto... Como alguem consegue recomendar um jogo malfeito como esse?			",124,92,4,51,4,1,2

												Totally a rip-off of Naruto.The Mapping is bad, the story not original, the setting illogical (a Ninja called Max), the dialogues feel like they were written by a 12-year-old (""Dude""? ""Bro""? ...seriously?) and the fighting is stretched, tiresome, boring and annoying and you have the hated random enemies.I only got it because it was in the JRPG Bundle with three other RPG Maker games, otherwise I would've never bought it.It's absolutely okay to get some inspiration from a beloved anime, game, movie and so on, but simply copying everything and not creating anything that's original or creative is definitely not okay.

												Disclaimer: I was generously given a free copy of Destiny Warriors with the understanding that I was expected to review the title after spending some time with it.Steam really does not need more RPG Maker viscera. I’m beginning to feel like that tool was one of the worst things to happen to the marketplace since anime visual novels. With that said, what is good about Destiny Warrior?Well the art style is actually quite charming; it keeps the appeal of simple pixel art with just enough polish to keep it from looking like garbage on a 1080p monitor at fullscreen. The combat has very pretty effects and in my opinion are decently animated. The music is certainly generic but far from the obnoxious noise I’ve had to mute in some other RPG Maker titles I’ve experienced recently. You also receive a rating post-combat that can give you bonus gold and experience which I thought was actually really cool. The interface, however, is difficult to read due to an over use of pastel colors and this also makes figuring out who the active character in combat is.It works, but it’s one of a million of these RPG Maker excretions. Do yourself a favor: if you like what you visually, go get a copy of Chrono Trigger and give it a playthrough.			",296,131,12,29,48,4,47

												The game seems nice and cute. I tend to quite enjoy JRPG and RPGMaker type games. I couldn't make it past the first 10 minutes with the dialogue though. Not only is the wording very forced, the grammar and punctuation is almost non-existent and looks like a facebook post in the intro. Regardless of how great the gameplay might be, that is not something I can fight through.			",306,43,11,96,24,1,39

												Destiny Warriors is a RPG Maker made game whose whole premise is taken almost verbatim off of the manga Naruto, even titles, characters, and events are basically the same. Storyline is bland and the use of vulgarity takes you back to when you were in middle school and started cursing for the first time. Generic, unoriginal soundtrack with a flood of grammatical errors help to unimmerse you from what would be a terrible game to an unplayable game. Battle system is riddled with tediousness and unbalanced scaling, just plain boring with a lot of glitches (ex: where the tooltip for certain abilities would let you attack multiple enemies and only give you one attack). Everytime I tried to take a screenshot or close the game it crashed by itself.Battle System:Enemies do little to no damage and spend half their turns defending and just dragging the battle out, one mob does about 20 damage when it attacks yet when it poisons a character they take 100+ damage a turn. Oh yeah, your characters start out with an absurd amount of health and level up at an insane rate despite killing the exact same weak enemies. Your main character does around 100 damage with his standard attack, the enemies you encounter at the start have about that much health. The kicker? Your characters do not actually have any weapons equipped when you get them, not even a basic rusty sword or anything which is just plain lazy and makes me wonder what in the hell are they infusing when they use weapon enhancement abilities? The majority of the ablities are lazy renamings (your non-clone clone jutsu also has thunder clone, fire clone, etc. variations) and have animations that don't match them at all. Based on the clips provided on the steam page it appears that even later in the game the damage values barely change if at all. Pros:+ If you don't know anything about Naruto then you might have some funCons:- Storyline is a bland blatant rip off of one of the more popular manga's (Naruto)- Generic Soundtrack straight from RPG Maker- Battle system is boring and unbalanced- Dialogue is extremely poor and vulgar and full of grammatical errors that create and unimmersive experience- Littered with glitchesTL;DR:2/10I always strive to give games a chance, even the indie developers and the RPG Maker games that playeres produce, but this is among the few games you should avoid even if it's a few dollars.

												This game is....very average. Three characters are pretty similar to that of naruto im my opinon which isn't bad its just not unique. The story is ok, but again also similar to that of naruto in some respects. Ok so as far as the gameplay goes, its actually pretty fun for the most part. This reminds me of yu-yu hakusho on gameboy advance (minus the movement during the fight). And that game to me was one of the best rpg's I've ever played. A few things to note that soured the experience for me though. First, the buffs (or effects whatever you wanna call them). Oh my god these buffs are the most overpowered things ever. So there are a few parts of the game where you have to split your party up into groups of two (which already annoys me), but some of these enemies can stun, paralyze, freeze, burn, ect... My first time going through this with my two characters, both of them got stunned at the same time. Not only is that an annoyingly common thing that happens but it lasts for (I♥♥♥♥♥♥you not) a minimum of three rounds. So about 25% of this game for me was just sitting there waiting so that I can actually do something. Like holy hell I understand a need for challenge but immobilizing the player to make it harder for them is not the way to do it.Finally, this game looks like half of it was written by a clever professional writer, but the other half looks like it was written by a 15 year old that forgot to proofread his work. I understand this isn't a triple a title or anything but cmon guys. You gotta be better than this.All in all its a fun game, its worth the $3, but it has its drawbacks and if these flaws bother you then don't get it.			",57,17,1,7,9,1,4

Story of the unlimited life bug...A ""fantastic"" Ninja (sic) story, that holds less about it's own background.Graphics: -  This is a plain RPG Maker game, and since you can't downscale the graphics it doesn't look nice.Sound: Ø Average standard sounds.Playability: --- This game actually becomes soon unplayable. It's bug ridden. I encountered several bugs, the worst and lastly gamebreaking bug is a bug that I encountered during the ""Tournament"". I have savegames and the fights went well, till the second day. I had reduced the opponent to zero hitpoints, normally knocking her out, but somehow the NPC kept kicking and lastly I ran out of health - Epic fights? Indeed I felt reminded of Le Morte d'Artus and the epics fights where the knights fought for days on, without any sign of weakness and fatigue - sadly in the game also unrealistic and utterly frustrating. Lastly the game closed with a bug, and needed to be shut down by either task manager or... closing the window externally... This actually is a sign of unresolved function calls, that can cause the RPG Maker machine to get quirky.Genre type values:Story: -- I've heard and read a lot about the story, and I've done my own researches about some of the given terms and historic topics. Yes, it is a fantasy story! Yes, it is also a story that is taking a lot out of ""Anime""-Stuff, some of this, too unrealistic, totally Mary Sue (or Gary Sue) and thus destroying it's own basis. To call the story ""cheesy"" can actually be an insult to cheese. But I am actually lacking a better word for it at the moment.Leveling/Character Developement: -- Unbalanced to a very annoying point. You rise fast in levels and will actually have no trouble fighting down the foes the game throws in your face. The skills and different kinds of ""Magic"" will become overwhelming. The developement of the characters is like some prepotent, bragging and utterly overdone kids playground.Immersion: Ø One of the better parts, because the game actually is able to draw you in at first. You will find quite soon very unsympathetic (in the sense of unlikeable) characters which you actually would love to skip down the... errr, drain.Overall: 8 - Alone on the given points this game is a waste of time, and money. Don't buy it, in it's current state it's just a burden. I am actually wondering if I am the only person to encounter the gamebreaking bug, or if others also had the same troubles.Value for Money: Fair at 99 Cents The game is actually cheap, and thus the playing time here is a good measure of the value.Not RecommendedThe game is not recommendable, not even to RPG Fans, not even to fans of trash...

												I really wanted to like this game. Just look at the time I put in. That said, the story was not there and I constantly found myself being thrown with typos in the dialogue. A bleed through in the menus as to what was a skill vs what was magic was a bit annoying, but hoenstly the balance became my biggest issue with the game.Again, I can look past stock graphics and sound, I can overlook a few typos, but this game will likely become unplayable for most by the halfway point. If you're going to make games for passion, great and more power to you. If you intend on publishing a game and charging people for your work, provide a finished product. Short summary:-Story and dialogue written by someone that is not familiar with spell check or the basic components of a story. -Combat and balance is completely broken. You'll be going back and forth from zero challenge, to grueling battles that can only be won by luck. I find it hard to believe that this wasn't recognized as a problem at some point - but then again you'll spend half the game fighting ninja 'rouges' XD. -By the time I put this down I was happy I didn't pay full price, but realize the time I invested was a far bigger loss than the one my wallet took. Avoid even on sale. There is absolutely no reason I would recommend this game to anybody. Ever.  ",202,62,2,56,17,0,25

												So, here we have Destiny Warriors RPG, ""heavily influenced by Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy and the Dragon Quest series"". Those are some big names. So how heavy is this game influenced be the aforementioned titles? Not much. I - being a lover especially of Chrono Trigger - didn't even see a hint about it except that both games are basically in a classic RPG-Style.What did I like?-The beginning wasn't exceptional but ok.-The game itself works - most of the time.-I really did want to see how the story progresses and it all ends. But it seems I can't drag myself through the end. It's just too painful.-I liked the idea of implementing quizzes regarding the games setting for getting some additional items and one part of the storyline.-Some thought and work has been invested into it.What did I dislike? Oh boy, actually a ton...-All the assets are as far as I can tell stock assets, which does not need to be a huge downside. But be warned: you might've seen these faces and animations in a lot of games, you've heard the songs thousands of times, the sounds are old friends (which might be a plus if you're very into it)...-At the beginning, it plays pretty smooth, your characters learn new abilities, they progress through levels and get stronger. However, soon leveling is almost obsolete. Enemies will then always take lower damage and dish out more than your characters can. The only attacks which work good are so Chi-expensive you need to carry ludicrous amounts of Chi-pills with you; and healing kits or ""tents"" (which revive all of your crew). ""Elemental attacks"" aren't really that powerful even against the correct ""contra-element"". Gear does more for winning a battle than leveling. Luck DECIDES MOST OF YOUR BATTLES. Even if your ""gang"" has the highest possible levels (it is 50 for some chars, less for others) you'll get your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you in later battles.  Even with the most pricey armour and weaponry. Tactical options are limited to finding the attacks which work best; and still you have to press Enter all the way through battle for a long time. Your only chance of taking some influence on the battles is using gear which might give extra protection against certain ""elemental"" enemies or... trying to escape. Which most often will not work near the end, even if your chars are maxxed. I don't know if it is even possible to win this game without cheating. I guess by poor chance it might be possible.I've played lots of RPG-Maker games and underdogs (I like to give many games a chance), but seldomly have I met something so frustrating. It is a frustration that sets in too late for you to notice to pull the plug. I know how many games require a good deal of grinding but here you do it just to see that IT DOESN'T HELP AT ALL. After you've done it.-The storyline. I don't want to put too many spoilers in here, but a good deal of it is pretty blunt. There's things never hinted or talked about by any (N)PC, it's just ""BOOM - THERE IT IS - IT ALWAYS WAS LIKE THAT - TAKE THAT, SHUT UP, DO YOUR MISSION"". It is extremely linear (well, many (RPG-Maker) games are to a certain degree, but here you are accompanied with this feeling right from the start. Minor Spoiler for one example: You get a world map at a certain point in the game which allows you to travel around. But you can only visit places you've already been to. Yes, sometimes there are little changes, but nothing too much.-Sidequests. They are not really quests. You can - yes, spoiler - trade in some (sometimes extremely rare) loot items for cash or experience. One by one. Always going through the same dialogue. Or you can fight some monsters which most likely will ""rip you a new one"" for some experience. Wow.-The Battles (again): Everything is drawn out, tons of battles are there to slow you down. Regardless of your difficulty setting you'll lose hours of your life just trying to escape or fight through the sheer number of encounters you will face. You'll spent much time restarting the game completely if you try to avoid some seemingly unnecessary fights by just reloading your game. Why? You can't flee many battles because the enemies are faster/better skilled than you. You can't just quickly restart the game with F12 because this crashes it in most instances.-Loot. How can loot be bad? Well because there often is none, instead you get additional fights which draw out the game even longer. You might have to fight even the hardest baddies to just get an empty chest or another soul-rending encounter. And often you get mediocre stuff you'd already have discarded because you need better gear to even get to the area where this stuff is located. Only money seems to help a bit.-Crashes when trying to restart with F12 (which might be a compatibility problem with Steam, I can't tell for sure), Crashes when you're trying to use some in-game items (like the great series of the ""Kitt""-Books)-This is a minor complaint, but the writing and grammar... well there are noticeable errors all throughout the game.-Somebody charged money for this.I didn't even finish it yet which I wanted to accomplish before writing this review - sometimes a good ending may make up for a lot of trouble - but it is just getting slower, sluggish even, unfair to non-working, more boring and repetitive towards the end. I guess sometime I might get to it but as for now... no. Just no.There might be more to say but I feel like I've already invested too much time into this game altogether. If you ask me this is not a recommendable game. Even if you get it heavily discounted.As it is with reviews, this conclusiion might contain some subjective impressions.			",815,337,11,100,55,5,84

												The worst RPG Maker game I've played yet!I'm one that actually likes RPG Maker games. They take me back to the old SNES era of games that have that certain charm. This game does not have that. At all.Pros:- Decent, yet typical story. If you're an RPG lover then you would have probably experienced this story a plethora of times.Cons:- Terrible scaling- Magic. Some magic that cost 200 MP does less damage than magic that does 100 MP- Corny dialog- Regular, random battles drag on far too long. It's as if each fight last 2-3 minutes. That isn't welcomed here.- Troll game. The game will send two fire users (forcefully) to a fire themed area, thus your attacks will be resisted (do a lot less/half damage). At this point you're better off just running from every battle you can just so you can get to the boss while avoiding 4-6 minute random encounters. That's insane and troll-ish.- Useless treasure chests. Run pass the chest(s) and you'll save yourself from forced encounters/""mimics"", random encounters and being disappointed that you got some junk.I've finished this game just to see how tedious it would get... and it didn't fail, it got even more tedious along the way! Don't torture yourself with this game.The developer(s) obviously tried with this game, however it feels as if this game is in beta. Hell, alpha really. There is so much that needs to be worked on that it's sad that it was released the way it was.			",756,306,22,69,76,7,96

												The game has potential but the monster leveling kills the game.  The monsters level with your characters but their stats increase far more than yours.  You will hit certain bosses that will be able to consistently take 75% of your life in a single round no matter your level.   I have no problem with RPGs having optional bosses that require some luck to defeat but when you need it to defeat a main story line boss, well that is just obnoxious.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Two things:1)RIP my long review that wouldn't save.2)This game has more spelling/grammatical errors in the first five minutes than I have hairs on my body.UPDATE 1: First Mission was originally supposed to be weed picking, and now I'm stuck tracking down some rogue ninja because my teammates and I are stuck up brats that would rather risk their lives than pick weeds. I'd love some Legend of Zelda lawn mowing in this game, but no. Instead I'm bounty hunting. Ugh.UPDATE 1.5: First mission...was a little repetitive.*Opens first chest* What the...*Opens second chest* What the...*Opens thirdd chest* What the...*Opens fourth chest* What the*Opens fifth chest* What the...This enemy is blocking the way...are you ready?-Yes.This enemy is blocking the way...are you ready?-Yes.This enemy is blocking the way...are you ready?-Yes.This enemy is blocking the way...are you ready?-Yes.You've reached a chest....*Opens Chest* What the...UPDATE 2: I've managed to beat every enemy without chakra or any techniques...just my normal attack with my normal sword.UPDATE 3: Mission 2....retrieve the real scroll, because it totally wasn't obvious the bad guy gave the real scroll back.

That can buy me a whole lot of nothing.UPDATE 4: No it's not!UPDATE 5: Yes it is!UPDATE 6: But it can't be!!UPDATE 7: Oh, but it is.UPDATE 8: My lord and savior has arrived.UPDATE 9: I have finally received what I have been waiting for this whole time...UPDATE 10: THE...UPDATE 11: FINAL...UPDATE 12: TRADING CARD!!!!!UPDATE 13: I'm finally free from the wretched game that steam has bestowed upon me.UPDATE 14: Eh, I've come this far, why stop now.UPDATE 15: Mission 2.....I brutally murdered four rats and stole their cheddar cheese. 10/10 I've changed my recommendation status.UPDATE 15.1: Misson 2...I found swamp grass and have a sword, but I can't cut the grass with my sword? I need grass clippers to cut it. Geez.UPDATE 15.2: Mission 2...The main character J.C. who is the character I move around with died...battle finished and JC is back on his feet. Enters another battle and JC is dead. Conclusion: JC is a zombie.UPDATE 15.3: Mission 2... I finally found the man with the Grass Clippers...and he wants me to pay him 500 Ryo for them. 10/10UPDATE15.4: Mission 2...I finished retrieving the scroll, but found out that the scroll wasn't a scroll it was a shopping list. I didn't choose this life. This life chose me and it sucks.UPDATE 16: Mission 3...My lifelong ninja dream is a success. I finally get to do what I wanted to do from the  start...PICK WEEDS!!! I'm so happy like you don't even know.UPDATE 16.1:Mission 3...I finally received the 500 Ryo back from the old man who robbed me of my money in exchange for grass clippers.And Finally...UPDATE 16.2: Mission 4....I realized I'm spoiling the game, so after rage quitting, throwing my computer mouse at the TV, and waking the whole neighborhood up, I'm done playing this game and writing this review.

Not sure if I can recommend it, as I have run into a serious bug around Chapter 6, where I get stuck in the inn... and can't get out of the floor.Also, I have noticed some reviews mention that the game has a Naruto-like background/story.

												Oh boy. I remember when i was 12. Ironically, F12 will save you from this ingame!I was so close to recommending this for the first ...1/4 of the game? (there's at least something of a story and characters are reassssonably memorable)..and then it all starts deteriorating rapidly off a metaphorical cliff.First off, while the battle themes are enjoyable the first 20 times you hear them, the fights require almost ZERO skill, but massive amounts of persistence. The creator has NOT had the battle difficulty tested or anything - all the enemies have an insane amount of health, but you almost always level up just from every battle. Tone it down! Because they have so much health, you're reluctant to spend the 20+ mins PER BATTLE. Takes some real effort.While some bosses (in particular the phantom battles) have a sneaky set way to win (like using confusion), there's no way to learn this without dying again and again...off-putting?The story was kind of charming for a very short while (very naruto-esque and i'm not a fan of naruto), until you really can't ignore the spelling mistakes EVERYWHERE...and the lack of commas... And that's when 'f**k* starts appearing everywhere. And not in a well-placed way, but a blatant 'i'm 12 and i'm super cereal!'...*sigh*The constant quizzing to make sure you're paying attention to this half-arsed, stolen narrative becomes compulsory near the end too...and the rewards weren't useful at all. The creator truly understands their audience.There was one part that was SO cringeworthy, i tried to print screen it and then learnt that F12 crashes the game - HAH. Max literally says, and i quote: ""I would suck your balls [for more power]/[to become stronger]""....-_- The dialogue is just so prepubescent. Then J.C's brother offers him a condom in the 'tunnel of love'....and not in a funny way.The characters make me shake my head forlornly :( Max especially - ""loser loser loser loser i'm an emo"". Is it naptime yet?ALMIGHTY SIGHIn short, kudos on making a functional world with some half-thought to enemy types and money system, but for the love of god, please get someone older/someone who has interacted with human beings to do the story and characters.God awful, and I made an effort NOT to hate them :(			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bad and EXTREMELLY unbalanced game with tons of unnecessary curse words, and spelling/grammar mistakes. Most of the enemies are very lickely to freeze/stun/paralyze you and all fights are against 3+ enemies, so guess what? You spend the majority of the time trying to heal yourself instead of attacking, as you've just spent 4 round taking hits without being able to do anything (I've managed to enter a battle with full life and die from a sequence of freezes without even being able to complete a movement). To top it off, when they can't directly stop you from attacking, they manage to burn/poison you, and as it hits a lot, you have to waste a lot of turns healing.There's a part where you have to fight 4x4+2 enemies in a row without being able to heal or save, and with all the problems mentioned above, that was a pain.Another problem are the treasure chests. There are a lot of them, so you would want to open them, but around 35% of them are fake chests with unskipable fights, and the other chests are just random non-essential items, so one would always prefer not to open them, as the reward is never appealing enough.There's a part where you have to kill clones of yourself (The infamous Phantom boss). The problem is that the clones are twice your level and while they can hit 5000+ (and your hp is around 5k), you only hit them 1. ONE! It is a known bug since launch and nothing's been done to fix this.It's a must NOT buy.Obs: It took me 12h to 100% this on easy. Don't try other dificulties, as most of the attacks are bugged, and you hit only 1 with them, so it is already hard enough on easy.			",196,54,4,15,9,1,21

												I saw the reviews and I still ended up trying the game... ugh. Lots to cover and much to agree on with others.The game description states an epic 12 hr JRPG and being a lover of RPG, I bought it via a bundle to try. Continued reading the description and yes, the plot is just like a familiar and famous ninja manga. The story plot is essentially large chunks of the ninja manga and that is just unfortunate. I feel the game could have had a much more interesting story than doing a spin-off. Next thing you notice as you start the game, is the english dialogue. This is either aimed towards a much younger crowd where the people either find cursing amusing/to be giggled at (oh my goodness, did that character just say that!) or the developers actually thought people would like such type of dialogues. My opinion: no. De-values the game and detracts from the game as well - too many errors in the dialogue. If you are even remotely a grammar nut, you will cringle throughout the game when the characters 'talk'. Next, the 'travelling' aspect of the game. There truly isn't much space to travel. The storyline is so rigid that you can't possibly deviate it, skip it, or come back to it at all. IE: you don't want to progress in the game, but want to explore the town/buy items/etc. More often than you want, you can't do it, because when you try to enter the store, your character may say 'I don't have time to do this, I have to meet ... blah'. To me, that detracts from RPGs I'm used and maybe someone likes it, but I hated it. I understand the need to progress the storyline and all, but severely limiting what a character can do in-between the plot is just aggravating to the player. Next, 'world map'. No such thing. You can't travel freely 90% of the time. Again, it's all limited depending on your progression in the story plot. Next, battle system! The game teaches you how to initiate, avoid, and fight. It's nice how they did it and through the game, I liked the battle design until a certain point. My gripe with the system is not how the battle system is made, but the balance behind the battles. Your characters learn new skills and techniques (xtu as they are called) as they level up (great stuff right? No need to find skill books or etc), their cost of using each skill or technique goes up. One skill can cost 100 and the next skill learned that is suppose to be the next level of the skill is 200. The amount of damage from the skill costing 200 does less damage than the skill that costs 100. That is ridiculous! Other similar things: 1) A skill says the ultimate skill, does 1 damage to the enemy, but a skill that you started the game with does at least 20 damage (WTF), 2) an enemy is clearly resistant to fire damage, but only to certain fire xtu - fire wall doesn't work well, but fire storm does (WTF), 3) the skill list is not organized for each character, 4) your xtu techniques doesn't get that much stronger as your character's level get stronger/you equip better weapons (IE: fireball deals 100 dmg at the beginning of the game, deals roughly the same when I maxed out the character's level with a much better equip), 5) TP reset - like mana, but they get reset out of each battle, which is aggravating because some skills need 100 TP for activation, but you have to either use an item or wait a round or two to reach 100 TP to even use it, at which point you will realize you will die before you reach 100 TP via a regular way. 6) xtu states randomly attacks 2 enemies, I use it and it ONLY attacks the enemy ONCE - the game is full of glitchs. Even aside from all those points, the most aggravating part of the game that made me stop playing (even though I bared with it all till almost the end of the game) is the balance between the enemies you fight and your character leveling up. Enemies in the game are progressive, meaning as you level up, they level up accordingly. You will notice it as you get stronger in the first part of the game. While this made me think the game is pretty cool to do it, it is broken. Once you reach your level cap - lvl 50, you will realize you are fighting eneies that are 1) higher level AND 2) above your combat statistics' capabilities (because the game was designed to have progressive enemies that will always be higher than you). IE: in a boss fight, there is the boss character and 3 henchmen. The boss character is WEAKER than the henchmen, because the henchmen follows the progressive enemy mechanism more than the boss. While you may think better equips, playing defensively, trying different strategies would work in the end, I assure you, it does not. There are items in the game where you can boost your character's stats. I bought LOADS of them to pump my characters up. The enemies just get stronger based on your stats. At this point, after the carnival part of the story plot, I am facing 4 enemies that are faster than me, deals approx an average of 1K~2K dmg per attack from each enemy, while my characters are max level, has the best equip they can get at that point in the game, exceedingly boosted, and their skills synergizes well with each other. I COULD NOT get past that battle for the longest time. I have died within 3 rounds of battle where the first round I'm attacking and the next two rounds I'm trying to survive, but fail each time. It's near impossible based on the progressive enemy mechanism. After a whole day of trying, I only got past it due to RNG - random number generator - on status afflictions. I got lucky and the enemies were stunned, paralyzed, or frozen. That was the only way I could think of to pass the battle. Which apparently, is the end of the game, because it states 'To B continued'. Yes, the game states B instead of BE.Other things: the game tries to be funny and nonchalant about breaking the 4th wall in the game. No, that just proves how lacking the game was designed. This game can't even hold up a match to Deadpool's capabilities in breaking the 4th wall. The game also limits your ability to buy certain healing items as the game progress. IE: can't buy a potion that heals 25% of max hp, but you must buy the 50% one now. Minor thing, but not cost-effective in cases where I only want to recover 25%, but I have to use a 75% potion to do it as I can't buy the other one anymore. Gaining money can also be an issue in this game. You can get loaded with gold easily if you choose to get the accessory (lucky coin) and fight/grind in the game when there are monsters to fight. However, getting the money does almost nothing, but for you to buy healing items. Getting better equips can be argued to be a pro, but NOTE, this brings difficulties with the mechanism where enemies get stronger than you consistently as you grind/equip better items. At the carnival stage, there are some awesome armor and weapons to buy, but cost a lot. I was able to afford it, but because the stats on those items are so great, my enemies are THAT much stronger as well. Overall, I played game for approx 14 hours with 4 hours of it being trying again and again to pass a battle via RNG and status afflictions. There are definitely multiple flaws in this game where I would not recommend others to play it. It's an aggravating game to play with all those flaws and even more so if you can't win a battle, because you are doing so well in the game due to the imbalanced design. If you want to play this game, you have been warned. 2/10 from me.I just noticed, I have one achievement left - reach part 2. I started on normal mode and I don't know if the hard mode is where part 2 comes in, but I am not replaying this game to find out.			",52,13,0,4,0,0,1

												I only got this game because it was included in a package deal that I thought looked decent. So I didn't pay much for it but I'm still mad I bought it. Let me try to form a Pro vs Con list here:Pros:*It has steam trading cards*It has acheivements (if you hunt those)*Cons:*Very bland storyline, not well explained*Horrible grammatical and spelling errors in dialogue*Very cheesy dialogue*Not a lot of freedom that you expect from an RPG; very linear game*Blatant ripoff of another popular anime series*VERY glitchy, my game crashes over the slightest thing; started with trying to read an in game book*I would say bad battle mechanics, but I don't think that would begin to cover it. These battle mechanics are so bad that it seriously makes the game almost unplayable. Early on in the game it's easy, if tedious, but later in the game you get to a tournament where you are forced to fight a group of 1 on 1 battles that the only way to pass is sheer luck! The computers character will either freeze or paralyze you to the point where you have to stand there and watch them take you down 2000+ hp to death unless you are lucky enough for it to wear off and their next attack doesn't do it again! And there is no way to guard against it nor increase resistance to these attacks!!!To be fair if I really wanted to pick this apart more I know I could. I don't like not finishing games I start, but I may not finish this one due to the glitches at this point. But keeping the tradition of all the reviews I write I have to give this game an overall score: 2 out of 10. It could have been so much more with a little effort from the devs, because I really do love RPG's like this, but please don't waste your time or money on this one!			",95,61,0,12,2,0,3

												From level 1 to 50 the game was pretty good, except for the foul language. Upon reaching max level of 50 it was very tedious. I quickly became annoyed. Doing single battles that resulted in a 75% change of losing and having to repeat over and over. I reached max level on chapter 8. There are 11 chapters. Equipment and tactics do minimal damage resulting in one possible attack pattern. All things considered, I rate this a bad game. I do not recommend it.			",16,43,0,24,0,0,1

												Warning: Short, but not spoilerfree:The game is pretty neat and a classic turnbased rpgs, though the choice of using vampire mythology is unusual and I quite enjoyed the story, so I'll play part 2 some time. Basically you start out as a vampire huntress and then encounter vampires, dhampires and random chiroptera that you put down while looking for your father and falling out with your order.It's an RPG-maker game, so you'll recognise some of the characters and styles as well as the gameplay. You get more party members than you actually have in your party over time, so you get to pick your favorites at some point.			",19,36,0,6,2,0,0

												Well, the early levels are kinda fun, but, as you climb the levels, the games becomes just plain ridiculous, both with the very same ennemies now with semi-divine stats but many other imbalances, like the Beast Spirit mode, suposedly all powerful,  that is actually very weak... Another example of this poor coding is many lesser attacks turning out to be significantly more powerful than high end attacks. For exemple, Thunder II is at least 5 times more powerful that X-Thunder, and most of Kitt mid level attacks deals more damage that level 40+ attacks of other characters, or even of his own, like the ""Deadly spinkick""  is commonly lethal on high end random encounter while his ""Chaa"" and ""Finish"" moves, that are only learned at his topmost levels, deal little to no damage on ennemies...Regarding ennemies, they elvel up as you do, giving them ridiculuously high damage outputs. For example, any rats you will meet (and there will be tons of them) is of the same level as your party, meaning those roddent will commonly kill your party after 2-3 bites, so leveling up is pointless, as your ennemies will always have the same level...

												Insanely difficult, you would end up spending more of your time grinding than you would actually continuing on with the story.  And with a story basically ripped out of Naruto, I could point out all the characters that got the minimum re-skin and a name change.  The enemies don't scale with you, and by the time you hit some of the dungeons, you can't run away any more and since it's impossible to go to the shop in a mission you can't restock on supplies that you use in between the battles that take five to ten minutes a piece.  How are you expected to handle 16 damage sponge enemies in a row, with two characters that get no healer, and neither of them have weapons that are properly up to the task?  The moment you want to advance the story, all the enemies turn into bosses, every single one of them.			",28,5,0,3,3,0,0

But there is not much this game has to offer, beside bad grammar.Pros:1)Have not found anyCons:1)Needs more backstory2)You cannot skip those emoji cut scenes, which get annoying3)Fighting system unbalanced. Why does a simple attack do more damage than skills or specials?4)It's not ""old school"", it's ""lazy""I could name more disadvantages, but I'm sure these are enough.Would not recommend, unless you are given it for freeМногие указывали на плохую грамматику, но ведь это не главное, правда? Проблема в том, что в этой игре кроме плохой грамматики особо ничего и нетПлюсы:1)Не обнаруженоМинусы:1)Не хватает истории/вступления2)Нельзя пропустит бесполезные сцены, в которых просто кривляются3)Несбалансированная боевая система. Обычные атаки наносят больше урона, чем способности и супер-атаки4)Это не стиль ""олдскул"", а стиль ""лень/впадлу""Можно ещё минусов назвать, но и этого хватитНе рекомендую. Ну только если её вам всучат бесплатно, тогда ещё можно подумать.			",19,1,1,0,0,0,0

												Even for a super cheap RPG maker game, this is pretty bad.  Every enemy is a damage sponge.  They also use defend actions constantly, dodge a lot, and you miss frequently.  Every fight slogs on way longer than it should, and these were just the opening fights in the first zone.  I couldn't stick with it long enough to get to a boss, but based on the evidence, I'd guess that would be even more sluggish.  I've played a lot of rpgs over the years, and I've never had so much trouble just killing slimes.  How do I hit one low level flower, which is for some reason a sentient enemy, with a fireball, a burst of shadow magic, a lightning infused broadsword, and a flurry of blows, and still not reduce it to even half its health?As for the story and character stuff, I've never played a Naruto game, but I would imagine this is what they are like.  You play a group of graduates of ""ninja school"".  Just like ninjas in the real world, you are teenagers in brightly colored uniforms, brightly colored headbands, and brightly colored hair, using magic to do battle with forest vermin.  For some reason, even though you all still live with your parents, you have a lot of facial scars, and several of you are suffering from mental disabilities.  I know there are plenty of people who would be excited by the prospect of some sort of Naruto sprite rpg, but for me, it just made me want to throw up a little bit in my mouth.I didn't play for very long.  I suppose it's possible it gets better eventually, but first of all, I find that extremely unlikely, and secondly, I don't care enough to find out.  I think I paid a total of like a quarter for this game in some rpg bundle during a sale, and I still feel like it was probably not a good deal.			",179,35,1,51,6,0,8

												I'm rating this as negative, but really i want to give it a 5/10. Some of what's positive about this game can be found in other RPG maker games. Solid combat system, weapon/armor customization, story focus, linear gameplay. There's also a decent amount exploration for optional quests, and chests are plentiful. I can respect the effort to try and make the story themed around ninjas to get away from the generic medieval rpg maker game (though i will explain an issue with this later). It's also interesting to see the author experiment with a skill mechanic with the tp resource as i don't normally see RPG maker games use anything other than mana.Where this game looses points is in the writing. As an rpg maker game, you're writing is like %50 of the reason why people will pick up your game, so here are some notes about this games writing.-The game tries very hard to explain things very clearly, which leads to a ton of extra text that doesn't feel like it's doing anything. For example the phrase ""speaking in a soft voice"" wasn't necessary because the characters dialog already had gaps and stutters in it.-Thematically you're supposed to be a ninja in training, but the scenery you're in and the people you interact with aren't really themed appropriately. This is of course, an issue with making a game with RPG maker as there is a limited amount of sprites and textures provided to you, but that isn't an excuse for how jarring it is to see a knight is heavy armor in ninja academy.-The plot itself was alright, until i realized that huge chunks of it were ripped-off of young naruto's story. Finally watching anime pays off!-I never thought i'd say this, but the grammer bugged me. So many sentences just felt akward; I'm not good at mechanical writing in general so i can't explain why but half the dialog doesn't work out in my head cleanly. Normally weak writing isn't an issue for me, but for RPG's where a huge part of the investment is the story, it sucks and really drains the enjoyment out of what's supposed to be an interesting part of the game.There is also a major issue with the abilities in the game, they are incredibly unsatisfying to use. Almost none of the mana based abilities do more than you basic attack, so the only reason to use your abilities is to either deal AOE (area of effect) damage, deal a specific elemental damage, or to heal.Some minor notes: there is achievement for beating the character Zane in training, however you train with the guy twice. When you beat him the first time you don't get the achievement, which made me think the game was broken. Some clarification on that would be nice. Also i would like it if i had a chance to buy equipment with the party members i'm going to use, so i'm not having to guess what equipment they can use.Ultimately i found myself liking the game, but i suspect that's because i'm a sucker for straighforward RPG games with linear progression, not because the game was especially good. It's not to not need a walkthrough to get through the game for once. If you've played other RPG maker game you know what you're in for, maybe get it for the easy achievements but otherwise i'd avoid it.			",189,54,2,25,18,0,22

												Plot is a spinoff from Naruto.Battles are grossly unbalanced and skills have next to no importance with 2nd basic skill being most of the time the most effective one with 20% of the MP cost of the most advanced ones.Apparently there is also some kind of meta game rule which makes your opponents stronger when you try to repeat the fight sfter a loss. Loading saved state from prior to the battle change nothing. Quit probably in the middle of the game.Not worth the time as it's quite and money even on sale			",12,17,0,44,1,0,24

												Unless it's in a bundle or you wish to see what NOT to do when making a RPG maker game, don't buy this game.It is so obviously based off Naruto that I can't believe this isn't pulled for copyright infringement.  So far it has to be one of my least favourite RPG maker games on steam as even when I try to look past the rip off, the writing makes me feel like I'm reading a poor fanfiction written by a teenager.The word ""♥♥♥♥"" (or any of its variants) should not be used unless spoken by a character.  Battles can be frustrating as sometimes you can only do 1 damage in a fight, and that indicates you're meant to lose, then in a fight where 95% of your attacks do 1 damage you're expected to win.  Also, the character levels in your party can get weirdly spaced out as some characters have a cap at level 15, while others join your group at level 11 when your main is about 26.I'll finish the game, but out of curiosity if this will ever get better and that I want to get 100% achievement completion.

												Have you ever watched Naruto?     - Are you a fan boy who loves Naruto so much a fan made game would be awesome?Yes: This game is for you!No: Can you tolerate a bunch of typos/misspellings, a story that basically changes a few names from the Naruto storyline and was made with RPG maker? If not... this game is probably not for you.Does it play like an RPG? Yes... Does it play like a well made RPG? No...I feel like the missions are sometimes too item dependent. Especially the lv60 fight vs Karra. On normal difficulty (Because yes... you can choose how much you want to hate this game) his/her attacks do anywhere from 400 to 1300 when your base hp is about 3.9k. Considering just how much HP recovery items you need to defeat that boss I'm rather frustrated with the balancing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TL;DRBased on Naruto, not inspired by Chrono Trigger/Final Fantasy/Dragon Warrior. It's okay, just know what you're getting into.3/10 Would Not RecommendFirst things first: This is not the worst game I've ever played. That being said, I can't recommend this game. The game came in a bundle with a few other games for practically pennies to the dollar, so I didn't read into the reviews before purchasing it. That was a mistake on my part. Always read the reviews.At first, I didn't know what to think of this game. For the first 10-20 minutes or so, I thought it might be a parody game, something meant to be silly. This is because although the description called the game ""heavily inspired by Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy VI, and the Dragon Quest series,"" the only series that it is remotely similar to is Naruto. Actually, the game reads like a confusing Naruto fanfiction: it mashes together Eastern-ish and Western themes to the point where its almost funny (your Village's Leader in the about? His name was Kage Alex) and there are a few rediculous moments in the dialouge (CHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-), and I think the game could have been hilarious.The battle mechanics are unbalanced and weird, and though I leveled up at an absurd rate, battles still dragged on to the point of being tedious. To be honest, I only got about 2 hours into this ""12 hour RPG"" and I had to put it down. The problem was that it just got so repetitive that I completely lost interest, and any investment I might have had in the plot went out the window.However, I think this game should have been what it feels like it is: A Naruto fan game. I would have enjoyed playing a Naruto RPG, even just for the novelty of it. But they dropped some really big, heavy names in the description, where the only things they have in common in this game are being pixelated turn-based RPGs.I know this game must have taken a lot of time and effort, and I would hate to see something I spent so much time and effort on be torn apart in the reviews. But my biggest problem with it is that the game's description and About were... misleading. I felt a little tricked, and no matter how little I spend on something I do not want to feel like I'd been fooled into doing it. I may pick it up later after getting a chance to digest it more, but as of right now I doubt it.			",24,29,0,14,7,0,0

												I paid $0.41 for the JRPG bundle on sale, which included four games. This was one of them. Unfortunately, even as a game that cost me about ten cents, even if it was free, I can't recommend it. There are simply much better ways to spend my time.I have about fifteen minutes invested into the game, but during that time, I started a new game, winced at about half a dozen obvious grammar and spelling mistakes in three minutes, then began the combat tutorial (""Come at me bro!!!"", really?), and tried to take a screenshot of a particularly funny error with F12, which instead immediately took me back to the ""New game"" screen without saving my progress. Start over!After experiencing such an error-packed welcome to the game, I'm setting this game down. The first few minutes of any game (especially scripted events) should be among the best-tested sections of the game, so that does not bode well for the rest of the game (which seems true, now that I skim some of the other reviews). There are so many more polished, more original JRPGs to choose from, I recommend you pass on Destiny Warriors. I truly am sorry for the negative review, devs, but I believe you can do so much better than this.			",110,40,4,25,17,2,31

												Got this game in a bundle, else I would have never bought it.The story of Ddestiny Warriors is quite simple: 13 years ago, the great Kage Minato... ooops, pardon, Alex, sealed three powerful demon beasts (a fire dragon, a water serpent with healing magic and a lightning bird) inside three children. Today, you are Naruto... sorry, I mean J.C. , a red haired ninja which uses fire magic. Your friends are Sakura... sorry, Maddie, a blu haired ninja who uses water and healing magic and Sparky (sigh!), a yellow haired ninja which uses lightning magic. Can you see where this is going?After your exam, you are teamed with your friends and Sasuke... sorry, Max the emo, and start taking quest for the old kage of the Leaf Village, amongst them I have to mention finding some bells in a forest and retrieving a mysterious scroll from the evil ninja rogues. At least I suppose they are rogues, since it's always written ""rouge"".I played 'til the point where the mysterius ninja Kabuto (I'm not correcting anymore, the ripoff is clear as daylight at this point) tries to make Sasuke join forces with his master, the evil ninja Orochimaru.At this point the game crashed, and my last save dates back to a couple of maps before.Since fights are painful as hell (enemies with low damage but a ton of HP, and same goes for your party), I'm not interested in going through these fights again.But this game has also a good side: the dialogues are so poorly written (childish, full of errors and without commas) they often make you laugh!EDIT: tried to finish the game, just for fun, but dropped it at the point where I had to fight 4 squads of 4 ninja ROUGES in a row. Best thing is I had just two character, no healer, absurdely low mana cap and a character with level cap at 15, which made him WEAKER than the enemies.I repeat, 'cause I haven't make it clear enough: the fights are painful as hell. They last like forever, and it's just frustrating seeing your character inflicting little to no damage, even with the best gear avalaible. The techs inflict more damage, but one or two of them literally wipe out your entire mana bar, and don't even kill the casual encounters.Moreover, the game forces you to change characters very frequently, removing the characters you have trained and giving in exchange very underleveled characters, and by that I mean lvl FIVE characters when your party is lvl TWENTY. Pretty funny, considering the level 5 PC is the commander of your team, and a long time experienced ninja, while the lvl 20 characters should be little scrubs who just passed their ninja exam. DON'T BUY THIS GAME.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It wouldn't be so bad if it was inspired by or have a similar setting, but no, they clearly stealed a lot of creative material from Naruto (character personalities, storyline, locations) and adapted it for the game, mainly (I believe) as an easy pandering to the fans to get to sell the game.-A lot of bugs, a lot grammar errors, a lot of ""edgy"" teenager dialog (cursing regularly to try and get some cheap laughts).-Unbalanced as all hell, this was not game tested, sometimes you are too powered up for the enemies, sometimes too underpowered.Recommendation?

Destiny WarriorsAt first glance this seems like just another RPG Maker clone, which it is. I don't like it, and especially the first 10 minutes turn me off completely. Cons down below.ConsSwearing - There are swearwords all over the place. Unneccesary, and a bad feature of this kind of game.Bad jokes and puns - Why their have to be all these bad jokes, I don't see. It completely ruins the game.Grammar - Destiny Warriors is riddled with grammatical errors. They are everywhere. No punctuation, 'Phew' is spelled 'Few', and commas are apparantly nonexistent in this universe.I guess on or two pros would be manageable to come up with.ProsBattle system - That's it. The battle system is good. And that's the STANDARD RPG Maker combat system. There is nothing good about this game, other than the next pro:Trading Cards - If it were not for the Trading Cards, this game would be pure garbage.ConclusionDon't buy this game if you're a JRPG fan, or a fan of the RPG Maker games, because Destiny Warriors is the worst of it's kind. If you get it, get it in the JRPG Bundle while it's on sale (I got this and 3 other JRPG titles for 0,33€), and only get it for the Trading Cards and XP. Don't get it for fun, it's not.

												This is basically a ripoff of Naruto. You play as a energetic boy from the Tree Leaf Village, and it starts of with a Kage talking about mythical beasts bla, bla, bla... After you wake up from bed, you go to the ninja academy where you basically get grouped up with Sasuke, Sakura and your brother. To top it off your first ""training mission"" from your teacher is to find bells...  But the worst thing about this game is the battles. They are very unbalanced and boring. The enemies have a lot of HP, so it gets super tedious. They also guard a lot and do very little damage to you, so you'll find yourself just spamming the Z-button for regular attacks and waiting for them to die.			",463,169,4,55,26,2,52

The techs inflict more damage, but one or two of them literally wipe out your entire mana bar, and don't even kill the casual encounters.Moreover, the game forces you to change characters very frequently, removing the characters you have trained and giving in exchange very underleveled characters, and by that I mean lvl FIVE characters when your party is lvl TWENTY. Pretty funny, considering the level 5 PC is the commander of your team, and a long time experienced ninja, while the lvl 20 characters should be little scrubs who just passed their ninja exam. DON'T BUY THIS GAME.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hi Naruto, how are you? Oh, you're not Naruto? Oh, wait, you're a terrible knock-off Naruto. Written by an idiot. Greaaaaat.Well, maybe the gameplay will be good ... nope.Will I at least have fun grinding to stupidly high levels and laughing as I annihilate everything in sight? Nope.

												This game is overall just bad. Enemies level up with you. Which can be a fun system. But when your limited to the basics of RPG maker it doesn't work well at all. Every battle is extremely boring to get through. Not to mention the story is a rip off of Naruto as many people say. I mean I've only watched the first few episodes and it's so easy to see. I thought I'd spend more time in this game to find anything really redeeming about it. Well... the maps are made well? And by well I don't mean interesting or fun. I mean there doesn't appear to be too many awkward parts in the maps. But in all honesty, this game just gives other good RPG maker games like The Albino Hunter a bad name. Don't play unless you'll make your money back selling cards.			",286,69,8,57,45,2,45

												I want to like this game, I like Cubicle Quest, but this game, this game has so many flaws!  Also I will say that I've played way more than what it says I have since I played this mainly offline and steam does not track offline play time.  I'm currently on Chap 9 in gamePros:-Naruto storyline-pretty good humor when the grammar isn't atrociousCons-Naruto based storyline-Every character you can tell relatively early on is a Naruto reference and some chapters if you can't tell by then will quite literally toss that fact in your face- There is an arbitrary level cap which you WILL hit well before the end of the game- The enemies lv with you making relatively easy fights becoming incredibly long and tedious by the end game- Nearly every skill is improperly coded so instead of doing realistic damage they do 1 dmg, every, time.- There are not only random encounters when walking through a map, but roaming ones you actually see on the map, and if one of those touch you, you can't flee and when you get later on those fights can take upwards of 15 mins to complete especially on chap 8 I believe- The cast of playable characters you can use is relatively small and out of all of them at end game you will only be using one of them (this game's version of Sakura), and one is completely useless for nearly the whole game (this game's version of Rock Lee)- Out of all the late game skills you get only one does any consistent or notable damage which is deadly bubbles, which you will spam in EVERY FIGHT- The music is repetitive to the extreme, This game as well as cubicle quest use the same base sound files, but there it actually sounds nice to me, here it is dull and clashes, the only song that has stuck out to me is the one where you fight all the music ninjas (the games version of the sound 5 from the Sasuke's departure arc) and that song doesn't show up till the end of chap 6 I beleive.-  the complete and utter lack of real stable pace in game, this is mainly due to how awful nearly everyone is and you have no real control over your party due to plot reasons.  So you can go from having everything falling before you from having bubbles attack, to needing to run from everything knowing that it'll take too long fighting them- Having both human and enemy units know the same skills but the code is different meaning they work differently, this is a really weird nitpick but some enemies later on down the line know late game skills your party can learn, but unlike for you they actually work for them!  This is especially bad during one of the phantom fights because it uses tsunami which for you does maybe 800 dmg, but when they use it it does nearly 2.5k making it one of the hardest fights in the game.So yeah lots of problems, need I say more?

												Yet another jprg made with RPG maker - a tool which has made it easier for independent companies to make, produce and release games. Desteny Warriors is normal turn-based rpg with both random and defined battles. The story, which is actually quite surprisingly decent is based on the group of teenager ninja students and their adventures - sounds familiar? Well it's a Naruto inspired game alright.Desteny Warriors has potential and the devs have done their job ok. The game is easy to learn and there is many well animated battle features to choose from and the plot moves smoothly with various cutscenes. I also digged the consistent, linear design of story - the linearness might divide opinion but I dig that I always know what to do next.The thing which fails in the game is disturbing dialogue. I really did find the story partly great, but it is clashed with clumsy comedy, which may make you sneer awkwardly rahter than smile. I also noted how F-word is richly used, which might be ok if it's timed correctly but when you begin to hear this in every conversation like ♥♥♥♥ it, ♥♥♥♥ that, you are free to ♥♥♥♥ around if you like, I had to bury my face in hands for shared sense of shame. If this is meant to be satire or joke I don't get it. I don't rate this down only for trashy dialogue. The fighting gets dull after while because the fights last seriously longer time than other jrpg games I've played. The hostiles can simply take too much of damage before falling and  animations won't save the day no matter how fine they are.In conclusion Desteny Warriors is ok rpg for its light price and I know worse ways to spent money. And if the game should get a sequel I'd love it being ripped off from all this tasteless gab and replaced with quality which actually is harmony with the rest of the game.			",202,89,1,24,10,0,6

												Would not recommend this game unless you like constantly fighting unseen enemies every few steps in dungeons. Levels are uneven and most enemies have more life and deal out more damage than the main characters even though they are equipped with the best equipment. Story leaves a lot to be desired  and is some what erratic in the telling. Not much background on any of the characters. Need to be constantly filling up chi and tp to do any good in battles. 4/10			",24,109,0,18,0,0,0

												To start out a decent review, this game is not bad, just horribly, horribly generic. That and the scaling of the game is PAINFUL, monster levels fluxuate, monster stats fluxuate (I fought two flaming mice for about 5 minutes, all other mobs had died already...) but other than that, this is a decent game.But for reals, this game is Naruto without a decent story line. This game is so horribly scaled that you will find monsters that you will run from because you don't have the time to fight them. This game is so painfully scaled that all you energy attacks don't work unless you use status ailments or the strongest one and even then you might deal more than 150 damage (monsters have what feels like 10k sometimes).The boss battles are again, badly scaled, in the story line you have to fight with all the different characters you have played with so far and it is PAINFUL, like seriously, the main character is weilding the condensed light super sword and then you get an old character who left the party at level 15 and now you have to fight with him. I litterally just completed a fight with a boss where every one is in their super form, but theres the catch, I CAN'T DO ANY F#$%@$ DAMAGE! I litterly beat him through the burn effect which is about 10% of the monsters health. Other than that I had my guys guarding (which is pretty decent guard compared to some RPGs I have played) until the boss burned to death.The healing items? Pretty dope. They don't work on a solid number scale but with percentages, which is SUPER good when your healer who has 1k mana gets 450 mana from a little pill, but it KILLS me when I use one on a lower level character and he gets about 150 mana which he will us up in two freaking moves.I don't want to go on, BUT I WILL!The characters are so painful sometimes. I mean SERIOUSLY, I had to fight a mini boss with my healer, and all the boss did was punch her in the face or freeze her. I had to keep up a continuous passive heal spell just to prepare for incomming freeze attacks. It's like trying to fight a low level boss in WOW as the healing focused priest, it's possible, it just takes for f#$%#% ever.TLDR; I will recomend this game because it is NOT a bad RPG. I will b#%#$ and moan about it because it has some minor issues that just grab you by the balls sometimes, like damage, status effects, SUPER generic story line and characters, and the fact that I feel motivated to beat this game, which is a personal that doesn't reflect the mass of people.Actual TLDR; Good but generic game. The fighting mechanics don't make sense.			",65,7,0,4,6,0,4

												Destiny Warriors is a combination of questionable plot with half of characters being idiots, giant imbalance of battles, with them spreading equally between awfully boring (because they last 15 minutes each) and impossibly hard (stun-lock before you can do anything) and the fact that developer never heard of a dictionary - amount of grammar and punctuational mistakes is overflowing.The fact that this is an RPG maker game does not makes this game bad, no. Its developers lameness that does. OK, typos do happen, but with frequency like that, I stopped paying careful attention to plot. Lack of commas makes text hard to read and there are dots missing between many sentences making it impossible to understand what is written here and there. Note that english is not my native language but even with my little skill I can spot countless errors.Battle balance is even worse: both enemies and characters have very big HP and very low attack. This makes killing enemies unnecessary long and dying nearly impossible. However, 25% of battles work differently: you have even worse damage, but one spell that does big damage, but enemy - it either does genocidal damage or stunlock 3/4 of your party on first move. I am writing this review as I struggle through last battle where you have ONE character at max level, which does not have any attacks that would do significant damage (except super attack which first requires drinking skill potion - to get 100 skill points for that attack, and then actually attacking, which will not happen as you will get stunned) while enemies have elemental attacks, that end your first turn by either stunning you or paralyzing. Of course, you will be dead before you can move as you can get both paralyze and stun at the same time, but they wear out not at the same time, so you get at least one of those debuffs most of your turns.If the battle is an easy one, it will be boring. The big HP and low dmg extend battles to very long times. There is nothing else about them except that enemy lvl scales as you level up, but enemies characteristics - and that is AT LEAST agility which determines turn order and is most noticeable to this as after level up you frequently no longer attack first - grow faster. Thankfully, boss battles are of a fixed levels.For graphics and sound - PURELY default RPG maker assets. I was unable to see anything unique in this game. The only thing that was quite good is that developer used different character faces for different emotions. Not every rpg maker game does this, so it is nice too see this small feature, especially that facial expressions go very well with a plot. But the game fails in many places, so its not really helping.Plot is so-so. People say that its a Naruto ripoff, but I haven't watched that cartoon so can't say. But what I can say is that its too much absurd at times.I would not recommend buying this even with 90% discount, too much bad development choices make this game true mess. But if you like CRAZY plots - you might want to check it out, but make sure that you play on easy difficulty, as last boss is still hard as hell. People say that on hard, its unbearable right from the start of the game.			",251,72,9,20,51,2,58

												I am glad this was part of a bundle which I bought for another game, or I would have been extremely disappointed. The final straw for me was reached when I tried reading a book, only for the game to crash. Up until that point I had actually hoped for the game to grow on me, even though I were bored out of my mind through the battles.Do you like long, monotone battles? If so, this game is for you.Do you like linear, uninspired stories? If so, this game is for you.Do you like boring maps with no variety? If so, this game is for you.Aside from that, it's filled with spelling errors, weird items with unclear instructions and generally it's just dull and very poorly made. I'm not really sure I have anything good to say about it, and I generally like RPG Maker games.Before it being playable, it would have to be rebalanced battle-wise (NOONE wants to spend so long battling the same monsters over and over again for minutes each battle), and preferably some proper proofreading. Don't send untested and unfinished games out on Steam, it just seems like a lousy moneygrab.			",40,50,3,20,25,1,4

												There are plenty of RPGMaker RPG's (or even non-RPG's like ""To The Moon"") who are actually good.Sadly, this is not one of them. Infact, there's nothing redeeming to be said about this title.Let's start with the story. You fight rouges (who look a lot like rogues instead of mascara, but let's ignore that for the moment) for plot-critical documents... a shopping list for the Kings Wife. Well, there's your plot. The only thing more horrible than it are the dialogues. Even though the best part of a RPG is already ruined, maybe it's gameplay can salvage somewhat?Well, nope. You fight with 4 people. You can equip them in the city, except, you only get the player at that point so you pretty much need to guess/have identic memory or note down what the hell the other 3 can even wear in the first place. So far the good stuff, combat is pretty much mashing spacebar (using chi or tp has little use), sometimes using right to select another target. Do take care not to press too much while mindlessly battling, as right can also start the combat. And if no action is taken you don't auto-attack or defend or anything, nope you're just have your turn wasted. Great mechanic!In the starting areas you battle lvl 5-8 enemies, in the following areas too. Well, you are level 15 now, but hey, here are some level 3 rats for this high-level area. Enemies can come randomly (oh noes), out of crates (well, that just sucks) and if you're stupid enough to wander into the random enemies.Talking about random enemies, they can't actually initiate combat with them, you need to run into them. Leading to many accounts of moonwalking enemies just humping you hoping for you to foolishly walk in their direction. Silly random mobs, who would torment themselves to even more of this combat system?Well, those underleveled foes become a blessing when the bosses end up, who ARE at your level. 1000HP+ with your attacks doing 10 damage per hit. Have a fun 20 minutes slashing into it. Sure gets that 12 hours there. And once you FINALLY defeat the darn thing (make it end!) ANOTHER boss turns up right after it without chance to save. Sure you can use potions to heal but overall you start with what you got (like no magic). Not that it matters anyway since this second boss is so magic resistant you need to rely on melee attacks. Have another 20 minutes of... ""fun""...Yeah, me? I went for the uninstall button instead. Bad gameplay, bad plot, bad dialogue... Bad game.			",1378,703,33,175,157,15,227

												        Have you ever heard of the terms: ""Original"", ""Copyright"", ""Trademark"", and “Plagiarism""? Obviously not if you've managed to blatantly disregard each and everyone them whilst in development... I take personal offence to this because I'm a part of the Rpg Maker Community and know that some serious developers exist. I also know however that this worthless game is deserving of neither praise nor hate because it's un-finished and broken! You neglected all forms of story arc, editing was a hotter mess than most reality tv shows and to top it all off you basically stole the entire lore of your world! Was there any Original content at all? Did you at the very least edit the scripts that you just copied and pasted? Did you simply use google Images to find pre made sprites and tile sets? I would complain about not giving credit where it was due, but I couldn’t make it to the credits due to multiple glitches.          Over all I give this game Zero out of Zero; it’s not even done yet; so rating it is a complete waste! In the future at least put more than two hours effort into your development and at the very least run several play tests to edit the gramatical errors. A complete waste… Just like even the smallest amount of money paid for this debauchery…-Snake 2557 ",13,2,0,8,5,0,5

												In case you are not aware, this is a game made from RPG Maker using the standard included content.The dialogue in this game is laughably horrible. Not just from a content perspective, it really could have used some proofreading for grammatical and spelling errors.I played the game for 45 minutes so I feel like I gave it a fair shot. I will not be playing it again. It is pretty boring. If you are nostalgic for a classical RPG, I would suggest actually playing a classic RPG like FF6 or search for something else.The only good thing about this game for me is it sparked an interest in using RPG Maker to create games. I am convinced I can make a RPG at least as entertaining as this one. Luckily I only paid a buck fifty for this game.  ",18,2,0,8,2,0,1

												I couldn't believe the reviews. So here I am. It is not a Naruto rip off. It is A TOTAL Naruto rip off. I literally had the first chapters of Naruto coming in front of my inner eye, while playing the first minutes of the game. Also the beginning is really boring, not only because I know the story, but also because they begin in the first 5 minutes of the game with exploring the battle system, which never ever was really a good part of classic JRPGs.Even if the game would become better later, it makes no sense to me to continue playing, since it is hurting my memories about Naruto.

												Okay, so as someone who has tinkered with RPG Maker for years, I'm trying to cut this game a little slack, especially since it almost exclusively uses the pre-supplied resources, save for a sideview battle system and various edits of the base character graphics.I can deal with that, and I can see why it was done. However...The dialogue drives me up the wall.Several words are misspelled, punctuation seems random, and the game can't decide between ""X-tu"" and ""xtu"".Also, the obscene amount of exclamation points and question marks used is just obnoxious.And before I even get to move or look at anything, the game wants to tell me the controls, and that I can press F1 for options (including remapping the controls it just told me about) and F5 for fullscreen/window toggle.The game immediately tells you about the ninja village you live in, the Kage that sacrificed himself, the sealing of beasts inside of children, the village in the leaves, and then you go to school to meet your friends, the emo kid, the healer, and the one nobody cares about, and your first mission is to retrieve some bells from your sensei.After that, it's revealed that Orochimaru, a ninja master long thought dead, is actually alive, and is......Wait, no, sorry, I got lost there for a moment. I thought I was writing a review for a JRPG, not Naruto.You'd be forgiven for thinking they're the same thing.Also, before you see any real action, there is actually a battle tutorial.It teaches you the complex art of battle, covering topics such as ""how to attack"", which tells you about the attack button, and how to press it; ""hp and you"", which teaches you the fundamentals of health points (or sometimes hit points); ""skills for the skilled"", which covers everything you need to know about selecting attacks that cost MP (I think it's MP anyway, I couldn't be bothered to commit any of this to memory).But yeah, a battle tutorial. For a JRPG. Yep.And just in case you forgot, you can press F1 for options, and F5 to switch between fullscreen and windowed.There are also save points, but those don't matter, because they forgot to disable saving anywhere you want.While this game has its flaws, it still did one good thing:it taught me that I can put very little effort into an RPG Maker game, and it will make a few bucks.You too can be the next big JRPG star! ...or at least make a few bucks on some shovelware. :)			",102,15,2,18,18,0,6

												This game is unbelievably cliche. It has nothing but flimsy writing and poor japanese anime tropes for a story. The battle is consistantly simple yet overly complex with too many moves that do next to nothing. Almost every battle can be won by simply tapping attack until it's over. They say there's an update to fix spelling errors and grammer but I was floored by how many mistakes riddle the game.			",36,20,0,16,3,0,4

												This game is all around terrible. I tried to tough it out despite all the negative reviews it got, but the more I played the more I felt like speaking out. The storyline is subpar, I mean they should be sued for how much they stole from Naruto. The combat is crap mostly because every attack, besides blatantly obvious range attacks, involve the character walking up and flashing a couple times and a damage count. The grammar starts to rip at your eyes after the first few sentences. To be honest, children in middle school won't make as many mistakes. What really got to me was the chunin exams. It isn't called chunin exams, but I'm not willing to put in the effort of going back into the game to see what piece of crap they replaced the name with. The battles were easy up until Maddie vs. Shizuney. I know, how the f*** can they screw up japanese name like that... but more importantly, Shizuney is invincible. You'll end up wasting thirty minutes healing yourself because Shizuney can paralyze and stun you almost instantly, but the point is, when you deal the finishing blow, her health remains at zero and she will continue attacking. I thought the event was scripted, but when I let myself be defeated, it sends me to the game over screen.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So I'm pretty sure I got this game for free, heads up. I played it for an hour, mostly for the sake of this review. I honestly can't recommend this game: the dialogue is weak and poorly written, the plot is essentially Naruto with a scattering of JRPG tropes, and the combat was drawn out and irritating, and I *like* turn-based games. Sorry to the folks who gave it to me, but it's just not well-made.			",249,125,2,68,21,2,45

												This is like final fantasy old school mixed with naruto. I was slightly annoyed the story seemed so close to naruto, but the turn based final fantasy feel made it more tolerable. I have encountered a few bugs which have stalled my progress, but for the most part since I bought it on sale for a dollar no skin off my back. Its worth that at least. I would recommend the game to anyone who enjoys final fantasy and naruto, and if its for the price of 3$ and under. I honestly wouldnt pay more then 3$ for it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's ninja school graduation day and after final exams it's time to send unequipped school children on a treasure hunt in a deadly forest for the amusement of their teachers.This RPGMaker game fails to show enjoyable game balance with starting fodder enemies taking multiple rounds of combat to defeat while also having wide level range on identical looking monsters creating player confusion.Characters lake defintion leaving them feeling bland and combat abilities are awarded at a rate to fast to make them have any meaning.  The story has a slow start and lacks impact to hook the player.			",1292,572,45,182,173,17,247

												The combat needs some massive rebalancing.  I got to the point where I'm stuck with one character who no longer levels (he's at level 15) and a level 10.  My other two are at level 22.  Yet the monsters keep leveling with the top two, and they have massive hp and do massive damage.  It took 6 hits to take out one level 16 monster.  And there are four of them.  And I'm playing on the easy mode.  And fights are random.  I'm out of patience.			",42,206,0,93,6,0,6

												As RPG Maker games go, it doesn't take much to make me smile. This game is entertaining to me. The tutorials are easy and do a good job teaching first timers. The story and script is entertaining and has a very Naruto feeling to it, so if you like Naruto, you'll probably like this story and the characters in it.The fighting is basic turn based team fighting and enjoyable. Overall for the hour or so I've tried so far I'd give this game a 9/10 for RPG maker type games and the price.

												So far, I liked the story. Although the story is really similar to Naruto. Even the characters. Some music tracks are really cool. Heard them in other games before. Some others are not so cool. Sounds like fast forward through violines and cats. Very disharmonic. The bad thing about the game is, the mechanics not really works. You equip legendary weapons and do no damage at all. Spells and X-tu and skills are there for no reason. You can cast Fireball, Triple Fireball, Hell Fire, Firewall or something like this and the enemies will get 100 damage. Just punch them in the face with a normal attack and they lose 300 ! So there is no point in casting anything. The translation errors are just horrible. Someone should reread this and correct all errors. Some look just stupid. The riddles in the game are really easy. To call them riddles is not really fair. ^^But at least, the game is not very expensive and it's a good time waster. Had some issues with the game, crashes and so on, but hey. For 1$ it's a nice one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok this game in a nutshell is Naruto. You have a all of team 7 just with diffrent looks and names. That said this is a good game. the skills are pretty cool and it plays like an older FF title. This game is simple but it is fun I have enjoyed it and I can't wait to see what powers I get next. Also for the people that say its too easy the game gets harder as you go along. not to darksouls level but harder. I think if you like Naruto you will like this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fun throwback to old RPG games on the Super Nintendo.  Obviously draws inspiration from the Final Fantasy series.  The gameplay is fun, but a little heavy on the dialogue in the beginning (which isn't neccessarily a bad thing).Some of the diologue has grammer issues, but perhaps that will be fixed with patches in the near future.All in all; its a fun game, it's cheap, and I had a good time playing it.You can check out my gameplay and first impressions on YouTube:

												Don't listen to all the hate, this game is pretty fun. Obviously there are some errors in the dialogue, and difficulty in some of the missions. Yes, the storyline is pretty similar to Naruto. This is the story from what I can tell: ninja kid named J.C. is given a group in his ninja village. The group, made up of main characters, does missions for the kage. They fight monsters and eventually Max, a grp member, meets a dark figure, who convinces him to join their evil organization. Yes, the story is similar.HOWEVER, don't mistake this for a lack of originality!!So far, after playing this game for a while there have been many people saying that it's easy and extremely simple.Notice how the majority of them have played less than four hours. The combat becomes difficult, there is no question there... And the gameplay is fun, but repetitive sometimes.I like the games music personally, and the look and feel of the world is good imo. I THINK the characters are more awesome than people give them credit for. I mean it's not a crime for there to be some comedy in the script. Nobody honestly thought this game would be esoteric or deeply thought inducing. Conclusion: way worth the price, if your having doubts I would try it. The end game takes a while to reach, obv. nobody here has finished it yet. There are some parts that seem impossible, for ex. the boss im fighting right now is a real mother. Seeing as how it just came out, I hope the devs update some of the bosses. If you want a good way to spend time for a few hours occasionally, then this game would be damn near perfect. If you got the money to shell out, I would say go ahead. I got way more than I payed for out of it, and im sure plenty of people probly feel the same way. I def. recommend it!			",70,10,0,10,5,0,4

												No or Not Yet! This game is not as good as the games that inspired it! I'm glad it was only $0.95, because the game needs work. I don't hate it, but The Final Fantasy series is on PC, and maybe Chrono Trigger will make its way to PC also. What is obvious is the game could use better fighting animations. Many good RPGs on Mega Drive a.k.a. Sega Genesis where I live had a lot better fighting animations. Just seeing flashes that indicate fighting when this game is Martial Arts themed doesn't fit. It would be good to see the move the warrior was using. It is kinda bland. it would be better if the game was updated! Check spelling polish the game.			",109,3,3,8,2,2,1

												If you hate RPG maker games that use default resources, stay away from this game, not recommended. If you don't mind the default resources, given the game has reasonable price, go for it.The story theme might/is inspired by Naruto. There are Kages and stuff, character names are westernized, so it doesn't feel Japanese-ish(I don't like that :(..). Description said it's inspired by classic JRPG titles, in other word, the game is just like any other classic jrpgs out there, if you like classic jrpgs, this should be a good collection for your jrpg library. When playing rpgmaker games, here's a couple of things that I actually care beside the story and plot:UI:It make good use of Luna Engine so the UI are prettier than default RPG maker games. Character's sprite and avatar:Default.Environment/tileset used:As far as I have gone through the game, the tiles used are default.Screen size:The screen is stretched, so it look bigger than standard size, mind it though, it's stretched, not higher res. But at least it's bigger. Support full screen but have black bars by the sides.Battle system:Sideview battle system (probably Galv's?), combined with customized UI, make the battle scene looks more attractive.

												Destiny Warriors follows in the tradition of the classic RPG. Our Hero starts out in his hometown surrounded by friends and family. He is attending a Ninja School, to learn the art of the warrior ninja. After taking your final test you are sent to the forest to finish your training and learn the basics of combat. Destiny Warriors reminds me of Dragon Warrior or the original Final Fantasy. Visually, it looks like a retro RPG and has decent music and sound effects. I think this game has been much better developed than Secret of Magia, which was also put out by the same developers. As a lover of RPG's, this is a fun game. The story seems interesting and I am curious to see where the plot takes me.			",479,176,24,74,66,6,86

												Ninjas. Ninjas everywere. So this RPG is based off the old school Final Fantasy series. You play as J.C, a ninja recruit in the Tree Leaf village of the Grass lands. There is also the Steel, Fire, Water, Wind, and Earth lands. In witch as a new ninja recruit you, ( along with other assembled ninja recruits) form the Pheonix squad and adventure these lands in typical RPG fashion. The story line is good with serious, funny moments and the games story line characters/character interactions reminds me a little of Naruto. If you like Ninjas and using chi-magic to take down rival villages and RPG goody-ness this game is a good one for you to pick up.The only negative thing I have to put down is, the langauge is rather mature and offensive. There is swearing and such so, this game may not be for the little kids who enjoy ninjas. An adult ninja RPG if you will.			",77,12,0,17,2,0,18

												Nice game, there was for my taste too much borrowed lore from Naruto but it developed into a original story. It could have made it with less swearing but I guess a bunch of teenagers won't hold their tongues when traveling in a group. Anyways the end was really difficult I had to redo and retry everything I had in my arsenal to defeat enemies that burned - froze - paralyzed - stunned you at the same time but its doable. The amount of customization is really big (over thousands of items.) And the fighting mechanics are great too like = You can defeat your enemies with normal attacks. Or use modes, try to defeat them with your class specialized x-tu or use skills like double attack, clone x-tu etc. The game also features a retry option, when you get defeated in a battle the game doesnt end right away but gives you more chances at the same battle, I think the battles are more about persistence than about skill.I think in the end you should try the game out.P.S.: If there will be a continuation I would appreciate if the publisher could send me a key for the game. I really like all kinds of rpg games.			",171,34,5,34,23,2,16

												As you can plainly see, it's an RPG maker game. This doesn't bother me, as I've played some very entertaining RPG maker games. Also other reviews have mentioned that the game lifts concepts from Naruto. Having not seen many episodes, I can't weigh in on that.What I can say is the game is a decent JRPG game with ninja themes. The dialog has a touch of humor in places. There is a little swearing, so be aware if that bothers you.The battle system is your basic JRPG setup, except using skills and ""Xtu"" instead of Magic and MP. The battles do take a little more planning as monsters, even low level ones, are tough and can't be defeated in a few hard blows. You have to whittle them down while keeping yourself and your team alive.It may not be the next ""Chrono Trigger"" but for the price, it's a decent game if you're into classic JRPGs.

Time to put down the fake Ninja scrolls and learn the true art of NinjayingWell, this is certainly different.If you`re a fan of Naruto or atleast watched Season 1 after quitting (because of way to many flashbacks and things that makes no sense), you`ll surely find the story of this game alike as you begin the game you are asigned to 3 other Ninjas to form the Phoenix group(sounds familiar?), the rest of the students all form groups of 3 which is weird, but i get the developer`s idea, and what was suppose to be Kakashi is now Zane, your brother, and of course the first mission which is a training mission, i`m certain i dont need to say what it is if you watched the first episodes of Naruto, but if not its bell hunting, one of those cute small ones for kittens.The game definitely got my attention with all this Ninja stuff and its humor, and by my nickname you can clearly see that i love Ninjas.But one thing i dont feel confortable with, since im one of those ""fantasy rpg"" nut jobs, its the foul language in-game, words like ""Bro"" and ""Sh*t"" are just not RPG'ish, dont ask me why, but i dont like when common/explicit words are put in Fantasy Rpg games, its great for FPS and such but not for this one.All and all, a great a game to play, its got its hillarious moments so you`ll definitely have fun playing this game, and if you love Ninjas like myself, this is surely a must have.I wanted to thank the developer for giving me acess to the game 20 hours before its release(unlock), i will surely treasure this one as its both Ninjaying and RPG'ish, oh and indie, 3 things i adore.Definitely recommend to all my friends on Steam and indie lovers, you wont regreat it.

For everyone else, take your money, and use it to pay someone to punch you in the balls/equivalent.

												Do you enjoy abandoned houses that clearly have people living in them? Then this is the game for you.If you're expecting interesting characters, a deep plot and a wonderful setting.You're going to be very, very disappointed.Flat characters, uninspired dialogue, funny sequences falling flat on their face. This game has it all. I won't lie, I am loving it due to how terrible it is. However I do feel even if you tried to enjoy it in an ironic way and you're not quite such a big fan of terrible as I am, it'd wear thin fast so I cannot recommend it.			",110,38,1,29,10,2,9

Too long, it's in a damn maze and there are WWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY too many random encounters. Another thing is as you level up the enemies level up too, which defeats the entire purpose of advancing. Epic fail. Literal the worst RPG I ever played in my life.			",24,9,0,4,9,0,5

												I think  this game is awesome. As a naruto fan i can see this a game based off the anime series naruto. I have been searching for a game like this for a while now, and happy i found one. To improve I think you should add a S Kyu jutsu that only J.C (Naruto) knows and his father (rasengan), and Max Sasuke) should learn a S kyu that only he knows (chidori). All together I think this game has some bad bits like too much spawning and normaly same kyu element which kinda sucks because if you face off alone againts the opposite element your srewed (ex. Max vs himself and phantom). Also the damage you casue also pisses me off, you do like 500 damage while they do like 1000 or when its a kyu that cost like 350 chakra and does 1 damage kinda sucks (includes beast mode). I can't wait for the second one, can't wait.P.S. If you are reading this game maker, please add something like the rasengan or chidori/or kyuubi/bijuu mode, Thanks. :-)			",98,10,0,8,3,0,6

												Destiny Warriors is an epic 12 hour JRPG inspired by the greats on Super Nintendo, Sega MegaDrive (Genesis), and the Turbo Duo. Thirteen years ago, your village's leader set off to confront the spirit beasts that threatened to invade and destroy your home. Among these spirit beasts was a fire dragon that burned everything to ashes, a sea serpent with great healing abilities and a lightning bird that could attack faster than light itself. While the village leader was a powerful warrior, trained in both hand-to-hand combat and magic, he could not overpower them. Ultimately, he had no choice but to sacrifice his own life by casting a powerful sealing spell on the beasts. This trapped the beasts in the souls of three human children. Unfortunately no one in the village, including the children themselves, knew which children's souls contained the trapped spirit beasts. Thirteen years later, as you enter the village's elite warrior academy, the spirit beasts have become restless and threaten to break free from their hosts. As student after student goes missing, it's up to you and three friends to abandon your training and set out into the unknown world. Use magic, might, and cunning in order to find the missing students and defeat the spirit beasts in this amazing JRPG.			",20,5,1,1,0,0,0

												To be honest, I think this game deserves more credit. The story isn't that bad. A bit generic but still not that bad. However. The battles. Oh my. It's like bashing a rock against another rock to see which one breaks first. The enemies do very little damage and unless you are good at guessing which attacks are more effective then you might be in theat battle a while. Eventually I got bored of the battling and kept trying to escape. I CAN'T RUN AWAY FROM THREE PLANTS! PLANTS! ARE YOU SERIOUS!? I got quite far. I mean I nearly sunk 14 hours into this game. And then there were the phatom battles. They actually offered some challenge. Oh Maddie and Kitt have got there super modes! Nice this will by fun. More phantoms. Phantom Maddie used Tsunami. 50% life gone. Phantom Kitt used Clone Storm. Dead. Before I could even make a move. Also I found that the Higher end abilties on Maddie did less? It seems like someone got lazy.In summary, would I recommend this game? Ummm If you are really bored and have less then £1 in your bank and really need a new game then sure. All this game needs is an update and it actually could be good.------UPDATE-----I finally managed to get past the Phantoms. Took about 3 hours of just restarting the same battle. (I also leveled both Kitt and Maddie up to 50 which is max)Now I'm playing with Spark, his dad and Shinzuey. By god they are useless. Mike runs out of chi every turn (He's a chi based character) And Spark and Shinzuey do hardly any damage. This means it's taking 50+ turns to complete one battle. That's about thirty minutes. What a ballache. I even tried to get them decent items but Mike was being a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and refusing to take any items.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Terribly imbalanced, not to mention the terrible grammar.....There is no strategy whatsoever.  All battles take minutes as enemies take very little damage, regardless of your levels.  Beast mode battles are way too difficult with most of your moves doing 1 effing damage while the enemies can do 1,000+.  Spamming pills does not count as a strategy and it doesn't even work without the help of luck.Also, be prepared to have a battle where all your party members are stunned, paralyzed, frozen at the same time and you just simply lose the game!  I don't mind a difficult game, but an unfair game?  I mean I did try to like this game and have given it a fair try, but to no avail.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												PLEASE NOTE THERE MAYBE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW IF YOU DONT WANT TO RUIN THE STORY THEN IGNORE MEim giving this a no im afraid its quite buggy, for me the one part i really dont understand is that when J.C(Main Character) and his friend Spark are Crushed by Karra(Garra from Naruto Pretty Much) and they transform you do 1 damage with all of sparks abilities yet and the only way to him really is to use Burn and the Roar ability and wait at the end of turns hoping the burn is gonna kill him. BUT THATS NOT IT, when you win this fight expecting to find out what happens the narrator saysOne week later....then BAM it says i have died and have to reload my state -_- which is annoying as hell so now i have a pointless game that i cant finish, tbh it should be free. its copys Naruto on so many levels, then poor scripting, the ridcolous leveling up Money income its just unbalanced.

												Note: Due to character limitation, I posted my full review on my FB page @https://www.facebook.com/notes/the-dragoon-reviews/destiny-warriors-rpg/996176493778374Overall, I was entertained throughout the game. With a good spell check through the script and some rebalancing, this game could be great. I would still recommend it for the hardcore RPG player only. The current broken mechanics are increasing the difficulty more than it should be. Until the main issues are fixed up, the casual player should stay as far away from this as possible. If you must buy it, wait it to go on sale, and get with the JRPG bundle, you’ll get it at the lowest price possible, and you get 3 other games with it. With this in mind I give this game a final rating of 1 stun-locked party out of 10			",40,22,0,30,1,0,0

There's mistakes in the script, and the ""company"" didn't seem to get any people to alpha / beta-test before release.Honestly, it seems like some dude / dudes just wanted to make a quick buck.

Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a terrible turn-based RPG made with the RPG Maker engine and it's one of the worst games I've played.I can get past the limited options and visual settings that RPG Maker games suffer from, and I can get past the generic artwork and horrible music, but this game has a horrible combat system and that I can NOT get past.My main issue with this game is the fact that your enemies level up with you.This is rarely used in RPGs and with good reason. It's a horrible idea that makes no sense, and makes you want to either:1. AVOID battles at all costs to keep the enemies low level or2. Fight in the same area leveling up to 99.However, WHY would you want to skip battles in an RPG? Why would you want to repeat the same areas if you don't gain an advantage from grinding?Why do the enemies level up between battles? My team hit level 10 in the first area and the same slimes and flowers were level 10 as well. It's not like they were fighting battles, and this doesn't make sense because in the first area of the game you should not have to be fighting such high level creatures.I'm not saying this is difficult, I'm saying this is not fun and that's the most important thing.This game is garbage for this reason, and I would suggest avoiding it no matter how cheap it goes on sale.Edit: I've learned that it's possible things change later in the game, but based on this being the introduction to the game, I didn't want to continue. This is a very bad way to start off an RPG.			",32,9,2,24,0,0,10
