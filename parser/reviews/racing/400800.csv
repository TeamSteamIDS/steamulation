Review as of April 9th 2016 (8.7 Hours Played)I'll update this review as the game changes.Summary:MXGP2 is better than its predecessor in a lot of ways but ultimately feels less realistic than the first game did.You begin the game on a stock 250cc bike (MX2) that can't clear anything and on realistic difficulty every NPC is faster than you. After upgrading some parts its a little better but it's not until you get on the 450cc (MXGP) that the game is fun. Even then, if you came to race AI NPCs you're going to be dissapointed. There is no bar banging like in the first MXGP. The NPCs don't make any attempts to pass or avoid you, they're very clearly on rails and don't fall down often. The pack never splits up like in real motocross or in the first MXGP, its just a horrifying train of bikes that take basically the same line for the entire moto. What's worse is that when they inevitably barrel into you from behind you WILL fall, and they probably won't. Still, when you aren't racing with unstoppable machines piledriving your swingarm into the dirt, the riding is a blast! Suspension feels nice and bouncy and cornering, although not as satisfying as the first game is a fun technique to learn. Furthermore, THE BERMS WORK NOW! You can absolutely RAIL some corners on the outside line, and what is motocross about if not railing corners? The suspension tuning and gear ratios do make a noticeable difference and I personally find it really fun to tweak with different setups while running practice laps. Anyway, this is getting too long so I'll get to the point. MXGP2 isn't great and it probably isn't going to get better but it is a realistic and fun experience in genre where only one new game hits the market every 2-3 years. If you're not interested in multiplayer, check out the original MXGP. If you're not interested in realism and just want to freeride dirt bikes with friends, go get MXvxATV Reflex. If you want to play a realistic motocross game with friends, I recommend this one.Developer Reputation:Milestone has made decent games in the past like Ride and the MotoGP series, unfortunately MXGP and MXGP2 don't live up to the same level of quality as their other titles. The first mXGP was released with a lot of bugs and support was ultimately dropped leaving the multiplayer unplayable and the game performance very low quality. I recommend that you take Milestone's poor history into account while reading this review. Hopefully I'm wrong, but it's unlikely that we will see any bugs being fixed let alone any requested features added to the game. The only DLC planned are additional rider gear and TWO more tracks, nothing to get excited over. Pros: Clutch & Manual Transmission Good first person view Great career mode Indoor stadiums! Plenty of customization Suspension setup presets can be saved Incredible replay feature (you can't save replays)Cons: Engine sounds bad 250cc isn't very fun AI aren't intelligent Colliding with AI means losing 10+ positions Odd player animations Air control take a lot of getting used to Only 4 indoor tracks...Current Bugs: Switching to Wheel settings freezes game in menu Changing the keybind for the clutch freezes game in menu Customizing rider or bike while in online lobby disconnects you from the match Audio goes completely quiet while taking sharp turnsVerdict: Apprehensively RecommendedThe first impressions of MXGP2 will leave you wanting a refund but after toying with bike tuning, upgrading to a 450cc and rebinding your controls, you'll learn to love it.The game is more polished than the first MXGP but feels less gritty and more arcadey.If you're looking for realism this game blows the MX vs ATV series out of the water standing as the ONLY decent offroad motorcycle game with manual transmission and clutch controls.This game wins most improved in a genre with very few competitors.The first MXGP is better and more fun in a lot of ways but this game feels more finished.If you're a fan of realistic motocross games and want to play alone, I recommend the first MXGP.If you want to play a fun motocross game with friends, get MX Vs ATV Reflex.If you want a realistic motocross game to play with friends, this is your best (and only) bet.P.S. Milestone please add more Stadium courses!			",180,22,18,6,9,1,5

PROSGameplay is more realistic when comparing to other motocross games such as Reflex, Alive, Supercross ENCORE, and MUD, etc. For example, you have control over the dirtbike's clutch, rear brake, front brake, and can shift gears manually. Also, use the left stick to control the bike and the right stick to control the rider's movements. All of these controls really matter as you approach certain parts of the tracks such as hairpin turns, berms, jumps, etc. Moving on, during a race, you have sessions such as practice or qualifying and then the actual race that conists of two heats. Scrubs and whips look pretty good. Use a Xbox controller to play.Career mode is great. Compete in MX2 and MXGP with up to 18 national tracks. Also, create your own custom team or join an official team. If you create a custom team, earn a reputation and sponsers. Either route you take, you must meet certain expectations of that team/sponser or be fired. For example, your sponser may ask that you gain a certain amount of points or do better than a competitor during the current race week. Each race has two heats (as stated before) with each heat offering a maximum of 25 points. At the end, you will either move up or down in the MX2/MXGP season rankings.BEST graphics seen for a motocross game. Check out my screenshot for example!

Customization is fun and awesome, but it would be nicer if there were more brands or things to choose from as far as gear goes and bike parts. I'm hoping for a modding community to start up to cover this.There is a lovely test track for you to play around on or test your new customized bike. You can now race on supercross tracks.The A.I. can be challenging. Overall, they can make you feel like you're having a battle or that you have to work hard for first place.There's cool stastitics tab within the main menu that shows your race results such as the number of times that you took first place, second, or third etc.2560x1440p support, the first MXGP did not have offical support of this resolution.There are some other neat modes like, ""real events"" that have you relive moments from real life MXGP 2015. Also, there's a game mode for monster energy FIM MXoN which is a ""team event scheduled at the end of the FIM Motocross World Championship, in which the riders compete representing their own country.""CONSThe A.I. can be an unstoppable force. In other words, they will knock you off of your bike easily if they touch you while turning. Also, the A.I. (all of them) take the same lines while racing. Overall, these two issues with the A.I. can make playing singleplayer extremely annoying or frustrating. When I tried multiplayer, the A.I. as well as real players were bugged. For example, the arms to their riders were moving awkwardly which was kind of distracting. I suggest racing without A.I. when online. Overall, the online gameplay was still playable. I had no lag issues. I've noticed that certain A.I. riders always finish in the top 10 or 5 which can make the gameplay feel repetitive since I always know who to expect behind me or battling with me.Falling off the track (even if you can easily hop back on) can reset your bike and rider making you loose your position in the race. Attempting to clear doubles or triples can feel/look akward or tough. The same goes for turning. There's so many hairpin turns in this game and so much lack of legit berms to rail. Sometimes I get really frustrated since I have to really slow down to make some of these turn otherwise I will turn so wide that I loose ground against the other racers. Overall, turning in this game can feel realistic and unrealistic at times.The sounds of the bikes are really terrible. Also, there's no great music within the menu or during a race. No real bands/singers or anything like that.OVERALLThis game is worth it if you are a motocross fan. I believe that MXGP2 is the BEST motocross game to come out SINCE Reflex. (I never liked the first MXGP). Please thumbs up if you found this review helpful! (=			",162,7,11,11,19,2,29

												It's one of the best mx games released, but they simply don't care about us (PC), we can't play online and I think we never will, the game will never get a patch to fix online problems. I will never buy again from milestone. EDIT:Well I'm tired of trying to fix this game. I have more than 80 games on my steam everyone of them works online, I never had any problem playing online games. So I conclude that this game is not playable FOR ME online, I know there's people playing but I've been trying for months to play online and I'm always getting disconnected ( lost connection to host). I have an Internet connection of 100mb, and high specs computer. It's not my fault it's milestone fault, so stop defending them. It's one of the best MX games I ever played, but it's a shame I can't play online. Even in motocross madness 2 I played countless hours online, and now in 2016 this game is beeing sold and I can't play online. what a jokeIf they fix the sound of the game and if they fix the lost connection to the host problem, for me, this would be the greatest game of motocross of all time. From mxgp1 to mxgp2 they improved a lot, but since is the same game just improved they must fix this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sound.			",103,8,13,4,3,3,2

												Great game! Certainly not perfect. I would say 7 out of 10.Physics are not nearly as good as Reflex, but i havn't seen any game since to beat that. And contrary to all the negative reviews: they actually changed gameplay and added loads of new features. For example:- scrub/whip improved. Its still arcade style and not as good as Reflex, but it isn't the animation it used to be in the previous game. Its now fully under the players controls.- cutting off tracks, wich lead to lots of cheating online, is now fixed. This sometimes leads to sudden resets of the bike when you go off track. But i rather get used to riding on track, then have all the cheating.- Stadium tracks are added.- Lots of customazation of your bike is added.- You can now run your own team.- And quite a lot more new features...To sum up the pro's and con's.Pro's:- Great graphics, by far the best in its genre- All the original tracks, teams, names (to me this is worth a lot)- Loads of new features compared to the previous game- Changes, like whip/scrub control, make me feel that the developers did listen to the players requestsCon's:- Meh.... physics- Still the terrible engine sounds- Performace is great, but you've got to test quite a couple of settings before you find the right one- Still some bugs from the previous game, but no game changing ones			",42,24,11,12,36,0,8

												(New review 16.06.2016! Please note that I haven't tried the game after the 9th June patch ) After 26 hours of this game I still find this game to be a DLC to the older game: I feel that game play is very similar and also the graphics. I think that they updated the tracks and the menus, but it doesn't make this game as a new one. This is something milestone has done several times and always gets away with it. The game itself: I still think that the game is great and I had a lot of fun when playing it, but there are some bugs, which are from the previous game. I don't like the teleporting, when you leave the specific track area by 1 meter and also I don't like the over and over gameplay which is nearly the same every time. The Ai is decent and can put up a great challengePros:+Gameplay+Ai+Performance with my PC*Cons-Bugs-Teleporting-New content compared to the older game-PriceOverall score 6/10*I7 4790k, 16gb ram and Nvidia gtx 980			",263,70,18,15,66,3,31

												Well I like it.All I see is negative comments, the game is not the same as the last one, yes it has its similarities like all games to but it feels fresher, the racing is fun, the career is fun and I'm sure I will spend many hours playing it.People get mad and write bad reviews because they are used to MX vs ATV physics.. Once you get used to it, you will find the MXGP physics are actually better IMO.It's not stupidly expensive so yeah, its worth the money and its a straight racing game.			",85,8,13,11,12,0,19

												The first game had problems. This game is no different.Cons: -Rider doesn't move and is stiff-Forced physics-Going off the track the slightest amount will reset you-AI is 2000lbs and you are 50lbs, constantly getting knocked over by them -Randomly sends you off the track, leaving you going wtf, over and over-I could go on all day...Pros:-Bikes and riders look great-Smooth at 2560x1440 on highest settings -Lots of AI on the track-Now I know what not to do when making racing games.Milestone,,, when will you learnWaste of $50, Don't buy this, you will regret it.

												Hi All, There is 1 thing really anoying me with this game and hope the developers do somthing about it. How do you feel? THE ENGINE SOUND!! Why cant they get it right? The bike sound needs to be more realistic to run along side the Amazing job they have done with the feel of the riding experience? The game feels great. The reason it dose my head in is that I ride 2 STROKE!! Why do they sound like a 4 stroke? I can live with the 4 stroke engine JUST! & think this could be improved too. I cant play any game without sound? Dont know about you? Please please please go and record some engines then add them to the game?? How can in 2016 this not be possible? just get on a bike, record the sound as it goes around the track and cut the sounds you want. We all know how great motocross bikes sound so add it in the game please. You dont get this with say F1 games do you? How would F1 fanatics feel if the cars sounded like tractors going around the track? The feel is taken away from realisticness. Sorry for the rant guys but it just dose my head in:( Any one else with me? & How do we get them to look at this?  ",83,4,8,4,10,2,0

												Yet again another trash product from Milestone, While all the elements are there the skill needed to bring together all the pieces is not.

												  Well after playing the game over 70 hours I can say this is one of the best MX games out there.   If your looking for high flying unrealistic jumping and stunts.... go play MVA Encore.   This is a Motocross game at its core with every control possible that you use in MX Simulator with the reflex control of MVA.   The tracks are pretty good and the A.I. is actually fun to race untill they collide into you taking you out in the dumbest crashes.   I will say the indoor races have no place in this game due to the physics.   The physics are ment for high speed and rough tracks....   So the indoor tracks seem a bit tight and one lined.    Play MX vs ATV Supercross/Encore if your looking for stadium racing.    This game is hands down better than the first one.			",17,1,3,4,1,0,0

												GOOD SEMI-SIM GAME!Like some here I casually ride dirtbikes and ATV's and played the last MXGP.This game started out with lots of negative reviews, but they have justifiably balanced out now. I would say that this game is the best in the genre, while it has some flaws still its a very solid game. Its very similar to MXGP, but with lots of new tracks and some more customization.If you are on a tight gaming budget I would say wait awhile for a sale or if you haven't played the first one or mx vs atv reflex pick that up for now.  I still say this is the best dirtbike simulator, that is fairly realistic, has nice tracks (18) with hilly terrain that you can feel, need to actually brake rather than just go full throttle all the time and has good graphics. Its basically an extention of MXGP with more content. Example, a feature I don't care for is if you go a bit off the track, they reset you. Other racing games will simply stall your engine or if not a short-cut its your time lost if overshoot a turn.7.5/10 so far for the brief time I played it and based on full-price.

												Alright, so I've played nearly every Milestone motorcycle game since SBK 2001.MXGP2 is at the top of the charts for their development history IMO, right up there with SBK 2001 and 2011.Pros:- Good graphics.- Spot-on physics, better than Reflex.- Great handling, after some practice - and you will need practice...- Excellent ""cockpit"" camera view, very well done.- Third person camera is also good, with adjustable distance (but not angle)- Good career mode, if a bit bare bones. Choose Full Race Weekends, Qual + Double Race, or simply Double Race.- Extra modes like MXoN (Moto-X of Nations), Real Events, etc. are nice.- Bike and rider customization is excellent for the most part.- Lots of settings for assists, but it's better and faster not to use them. Full sim with Pro physics all the way and don't look back.- Rewind and Quick Restart features, both of which can be handy (pro tip: keep rewinds on for AI races, they WILL crash into you on occasion). Definitely handy for the holeshot against a pack of AI.- Lots of tracks, all of them real-world, save the four or so imaginary stadiums which have you doing quasi-Supercross (which is cool).- Fantastic replay system, but unfortunately you cannot save them to view later.- You will spend hours in photo mode getting those photo-realistic screenshots (check mine out for examples). Or not, but it's there if you want to.Cons:- Typical Milestone ""it's barely passable"" bike sounds. There's hope for the future though because RIDE 2 just came out and has the best sounds I've heard so far from a Milestone game so maybe MXGP3 will sound better? Pray with me now to the God of MX...- After whipping or scrubbing you lose air control and have to pray to the aforementioned God of MX that your initial trajectory wasn't garbage.- When making contact with AI riders, there's a 90% chance to dismount you while they drive on. This can be mitigated somewhat by avoiding extra lean (right stick) while turning if other riders are elbow-to-elbow. Since discovering this I can now make light contact without being thrown off.- No triple buffered v-sync. Must use Adaptive V-Sync on Nvidia for a tear-free image without terrible frame drops. Not sure what you could do on an AMD card, except suffer. Direct3D Overrider does NOT work as the game is 64-bit. :(- A few bugs with the Test Track recording lap times, somehow one of my 450s has set a balls-on-fire 9.2 second time on the long track. Seems legit.- Not many, if any at the time, people playing online. Pretty common with bike games unfortunately, but does support private lobbies for you and buddies.- Can save and apply custom bike setups, but in typical Milestone fashion, will not apply them for you automatically come race time. Not a deal-breaker at all, but a constant small annoyance (another issue in all Milestone games).Highly recommended for any and all MX fans. General bike fans will most likely dig it, and other racing fans may as well depending on their taste for realism and motocross. Basically, don't expect to jump on your bike and be fast in this game. Hell, don't expect to make it around your first turn fast and intact until you've got some practice time in. Even then you will get dismounted and ran over by a half dozen or so riders every other holeshot. ;)			",246,11,22,39,20,0,41

												MXGP2 is the best MX game to date! And I've played pretty much every MX game going back to excite bike on the NES to having 277 hours in Reflex on the Steam/PC version alone (double that counting time spent on the Xbox 360 version). They really nailed it with physics, gameplay, graphics, and detail. There's so much detail you can even see the welds in the swingarm! I came in expecting just a MXGP1 re-hash with some added tracks but it feels and looks totally overhauled with the exception of sounds which the rest is so good I can almost completely forgive the the sound which falls behind the quality of the rest of the game.But just to be warned, there's a learning curve with the updated physics. Like I said, I was expecting just a re-hash of MXGP and thought my same techniques would all carry over but it turned out to be quite different! And it's all for the better! Now to powerslide corners, or rail the inside line and blast out of the corners ripping you have to utilise the clutch and leaning where as in the first game I almost never had to use the lean much and never used the clutch. The bike has a much softer feel now as well. Gone are the days when it looked and sounded so stiff almost to where you had no suspension when landing or blasting whoops. The suspension has a real plush feel to it now.The replay system is also much improved. You can fast forward and rewind at varying speeds using the RT and LT on a xbox controller. You can really get some sick screenshots with the replay! I can really go on and on about all the improvements and how good the game is, but just take it from someone who used to race in real life and has played nearly every MX game to date going back to the 80's, this is the best one by a long shot! I'm glad to see so many developers of racing games steering more towards realism these days instead of arcade physics and Milestone won't dissapoint you if you're looking for realism! Real tracks, real riders, realistic graphics and handling, what else could you possibly want? Plus for us older guys that used to race for real, this satisfies the MX racing crave but is so much safer, i.e. no broken bones to deal with, lol. Of yea, the MX of Nations mode is another nice added bonus!			",49,6,7,3,6,0,0

												ENG:After a little testing game, i was myself a pretty big disappointment.The game publishing feel myself more update than a new video game. I was expecting a lot more like a game than the game promises and offers. The game also does not offer much the reforms or improvements that usually a new video game might expect.I was expecting also that, the game would have been a multi-profile support which I had hoped the forum of the game for many weeks before the game's release but, it did not come and the game's customization options are pretty non-existent. Changes largely is more visual, which is used for a few 3d model of which is available then only a few color option.If the video game would not have the possibility of customization, so the game would be almost identical at the same video game than an old MXGP game release.The game is the gameplay is completely identical and as a game pretty much the same game as the the old MXGP game release but, just a little updated, as well as the driver list.Sure, this video game developed and reached forward & game is not entirely bad at all but, the game did not offer myself enough new and significant improvement, which is an older game release contain.So, if you happen to own an older release of the game, so I do not recommend necessarily to buy this game but, if you buy a motocross game for the first time, so this is a good choice.I gonna refund this a game, sadly...FIN:Pienen testailun jälkeen peli oli itselleni melkoisen suuri pettymys. Peli tuntui lähes pelkästään vuosi päivitykseltä. Odotin peliltä paljon enemmän kuin mitä lupaukse ja pelin kuva antoi pelistä mutta, peli ei juurikaan tarjonnut niitä mahdollisuuksia joita olisin odottanut peliltä.Peli ei tue moniprofiili tukea jota toivoin foorumissa jo monta viikkoa ennen pelin julkaisua ja pelin kustomointi mahdollisuudet on melkoisen olemattomat. Pääosin muutokset on enemmän visuaalisuutta, joissa käytetään vaan muutamaa 3d mallia josta on tarjolla sitten vain muutama värivaihtoehto. Jos tätä pieniä kustomointi mahdollisuutta ei olisi niin, peli olisi lähes tai suorastaan ihan täysin sama peli kuin aikasempi julkaistu MXGP 1 -peli.Peli on pelattavuus on täysin identtinen ja pelinä aikapitkälti sama peli kuin aikasempi julkaisu mutta, vain vähän päivitetty sekä kuljettaja lista.Toki pelissä on jotakin hyvääkin ja kehittynyt myönteiseen suuntaan mutta, peli ei vaan yksinkertaisesti tarjoa itselleni riittävästi uudistuksia ja erilaisuutta mitä, aikasempi osa jo valmiiksi tarjosi.Jos satut siis omistamaan vanhemman peli julkaisun niin, en suosittele välttämättä ostaa tätä peliä mutta, jos ostat motocross peliä ekaa kertaa niin, tämä on hyvä vaihtoehto.Joudun siis palauttamaan pelin valitettavasti.

												Really happy with the game so far. The AI put up a good challenge, I'm having some real battles. Physics are fantastic as long as you have them on pro, watch any replay after a race and the movements look spot on. Get a few upgrades on the bike and it brakes and controls alot better too. Whip controls and physics are a little bit odd but an improvment over the previous MXGP. Nice graphics too, love taking screenshots in replays. The most complete Motorcross game available. progressive career, lots of bike upgrades and gear options. I have played EVERY motorcross game since excitebike on nintendo. This is a solid MX game 8/10			",198,7,13,14,28,1,17

												After a good while in the game I have decided this game is worth the buy, just not for $50. It improved on the first MXGP in many ways. The graphics are touched up, the physics were redone, very weird at first but after awhile they are fine. The customization from the career rider stand point was well needed. The stadium series is a major let done as the tracks are far smaller then any mx game that has ""supercross"". The much needed addition of 22 riders was a big thing for me. The only REAL downside for me is that the game appears to have some serious frame rate lag. 20-30 fps while in races and 100fps while in the menus has me a bit concerned but then again that could very well be on my end. I say if you are hoping for a better MXGP then go ahead and purchase. Yeah the price of $50 is a bit concerning but then again the demand for Motocross games is very high. All in all I give it a 7.5/10			",15,0,5,0,2,0,1

												This is a very good game if your looking for something arcady, but still a little bit realistic. a lot of people are complaning about this game not having as ""realistic"" physics as reflex. But Reflex's physics are not even close to being realistic.Pros:A lot of new features since the last gameA giant amount of customazation for both riders and bikesMany tracks (Indoor and outdoor), wich are very nicely detailed and realistic.Amazing graphics and nice effectsQuite easy to learnOfficial riders, teams, manufacturers, tracks and sponsors. (you can even make your own team)Ok things:The AI can be dumb sometimes and just ignore if you are in front of them and they sometimes look like they are programmed to just one line.The music is badass sometimes but sometimes it feels like it does'nt fit in.The scrubs are better than the last game, but still quite uncontrollable.Cons:Blender sounds for the bikesIn air physics can be a bit wackySmall bugs and glitches can happen from time to time.Multiplayer can be a bit laggy (It looks like the other people are all over the place) might be my internet...A solid 8/10 from me			",75,2,5,0,3,1,0

												Never thought I would say this about a Milestone product, but this actually is a really solid game. With pro-physics, seperate brakes and using the first person camera the racing feels very satisfying. Also I didn't experience any game braking bugs like in the first game, where the sound dissapeared after a few races.Online works ok as well, but you have to create a seperate account for it which isn't made very clear in the game. After that I could do races with friends and AI without problems.			",198,24,47,10,24,3,15

												Okay so I've played for 100 minutes and here is what I've worked out. the bike feels alright on the ground, maybe a little too heavy, jumping feels like a road bike (It's super heavy!), in air control it feels like a bmx bike, super light(but with some limitations). the sounds dont really match up to the speed of the bike. The customization is really good though, only thing I'd of liked to of seen is the ability to pick a custom team photo from your computer. The first person view sucks though which is quite sad since i like playing in first person.Bottom line is it's a good game.			",36,2,7,2,3,1,4

												Love this game! very big step from the first MXGP. The physics are still the same, and I am ok with that. That being said about the physics, there are still some changes to how you drive the bike, like scrubs, weight transfer etc. The new rewind feature is very useful, helps alot when you make a mistake that could cost you the race (I just wish there was a points bonus for not using the rewinds but no biggie). The customization in this game is very detailed, whether it be the riders equipment or the everything about the bike. I love how they setup the career mode, how you can create your own team and make everything look the way you want, or you can join a real team. Presentaion has been improved, all those stupid generic presentations at the end of the race are gone. Graphics look very good, you can definatley see the difference between this years and last years game. This game posts a bigger challenge in the difficulty, which is very good cause i was running circles around the competition in last years game even on the hard and realistic difficulties. Overall, this game is a must have for dirt bike riders, or racers in general like me lol. Plus this game is at a very good price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												EDIT!!!!: After playing a few more races on pro physics Imust say it changes the game completely! So much betterThis game is the first motocross game I've played since MX vs ATV Alive. I must say its enjoyable with some frustrating features. The customization is brilliant, with all licensed bikes, gear and parts. Game play is pretty good controls feel much smoother than they look in videos. Especially if you play around with the physics settings. The whip controls are weird but you get used to them. Graphics are great!Now there is some flaws in the game.1)The AI riders go out of their way to push you off the track, ie if you have an inside line on a straight the AI rider behind you will turn into your back wheel until you crash, very frustrating2)The off track reset system is annoying as hell. 3) Sound isn't great but you can deal with it. Overall a fairly fun game although can be very annoying at times.  7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A good step in the right direction! I know that mx games have to be incredibely hard to develop, since there are so many aspects. Here are some things the guys at Milestone can work on for the MXGP 3: - The physics: you can feel that the base of this was taken from MotoGP, and I believe that is a big  mistake since dirt bikes handle completely different than street bikes. There are some very frustrating scenarios where you crash because of no reason. For example, when you try to give someone a blockpass, you'll just always tip over. However, once you get the hang of it (for me this was at like 8 hours in) you can have a lot of fun with it. Not realistic at all, but fun. - The sound: It's horrible. Nothing more to add. The engine sound sounds more like some random noise. No real rev limiter. Just completely in the wrong direction in this department, I can't even find words for it.- Tracks are not rough enough: They are always like the first lap of practice, completely perfectly shaped and pretty boring at times. Lommel is the best example, it's 100% smooth and therefore not Lommel. However I can imagine that rough tracks would be quite hard to ride as well with the poor physics.- No qualification race: Come on Milestone, you could have at least given us the option of having a real weekend with different practices and a qualification race.- Boot models: please make them a little more detailed and add ""height"" to them. They look like painted rubber boots.Buuuuut there are also many good points, like great customisation, good graphics and all the licenses. All in all it's a real fun game and I just listed all negative points that deserve to be worked on for the next game.I actually recommend the game, even if you're not 100% happy with it. But if you don't buy it, they'll stop making mx games as well and soon we won't have any games besides MX SIM which would be a shame, so support the sport!			",17,6,10,3,5,0,1

												I am one of the MX vs ATV fans that has been waiting a decade for an upgraded Reflex. MVA Supercross was released, and it was garbage. So, I continued to wait. Then, a friend recommended this game. I checked it out on here, and it looked alright, but I held off on buying this game for awhile (admittedly because it is based on european MX). I didn't think that I would enjoy it, so I waited until the game was on sale.Holy crap, was I suprised! This game is definitely not like the MVA franchise, but it turns out that that may not be a bad thing. Initially, you feel like you are ""on rails"" (can't turn easily). This was annoying, but I persevered. Also, the AI seemed to be ""on rails"" also, and they always seemed to win bar-banging incidents. Yet, I continued to give the game a chance...Ultimately, I discovered the necessity of changing the settings to ""Pro"" and learning how to setup the bike. It just takes practice. Ultimately, I learned how to throw the bike around, scrub and whip, etc. I am happy I gave the game a chance, as I no longer have to play Reflex (thousands of laps on a dozen tracks gets old).If you crank up the settings and difficulty, and learn how to control the bike, this game can be very fun! It is the most realistic MX game out there IMO. That being said, it isn't perfect!Pros:- Realistic physics- Realistic career mode- Real tracks, bikes and riders- Sponsorships in career mode are a cool, immersive feature- 250s are under-powered- Rider customization is greatCons:- Number plate font is GOD AWFUL!!! 'Copperplate Gothic' or some crap like that... It's dated and ugly- worse than 'Impact'- AI take the same EXACT line every lap of every race- always.- You are easily taken out by AI from the outside during cornering (if you don't rewind and go straight during contact)- Ruts do not develop anywhere except AI lines- When riding for a team, you have to wear whatever brand/style of gear their real star rider wears (For example: Red Bull KTM, you have to wear Cairoli's AXO gear in Black/Orange ONLY)- No american tracks (except Glen Helen), which is not a huge deal, but I am not a huge fan of European tracks and the style of riding they require- Scrubbing results in you not being able to lean just before landing (which can force you off the course if you were not pointing straight towards your desired direction during take-off)- Once mastered, the AI are no longer challenging enough (you just win every race, which is no fun)Overall, this game is awsome! You will not regret buying it. Going back, I would've paid the full $50 USD (or whatever) for this when it first came out. If the developers would improve the AI to make them behave as realistically as the rest of the game, this would be the best MX game to date!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had my game refunded, and here is why:1. This game doesn't feel smooth. As in the controls feel different from the original MXGP. (Not a big problem).2. I thought this game was supposed to be realistic. But being realistic isn't being reset back 5 - 10 meters because you had the slightest mistep off the track.3. There are several Glitches and bugs in the game, which ruins the races. (It's also in the homescreen).4. This one was one of the main reasons I got a refund. I bought the special version of the game which includes the 2 rider outfits. It said that I needed to make an online account. Once I finished making it I tried to sign in which was successful, but then it said I need to do something with my email. But I never got an email from this game or steam. So I basically bought the special edition for nothing. (I tried several times of reseting my computer, game, refreshing the page, signing out of steam). If these could be fixed, I would LOVE to buy this game! ",45,2,9,3,12,0,10

												When this game came out I was very pumped for this game to get downloaded. Then I was side tracked by all of the negative reviews and started to double guess. when i started playing ths game it froze and was very pixle ish. After that i fixed the settings by turning vsync of. The game was very good. I did not understand what all of the bad reviews were for. The only problem i had was that the racing was impossable. The first game was very easy. What i really loved about the game is the customization. I made the bike just like the one i have in real life ( A honda crf 250r) Despite the game being impossable i spent most of my time on the test track having loads of fun. Now that the game has more players the rating went from ""Mixed"" to ""Mostly posative"" I will give this game a 9/10.			",25,2,3,2,4,0,0

												A very fun game (especially good if you get a controller connected up). Took me a while to get used to the bikes controls however after an hour of playing I was able to ride perfectly. The customization for bikes and charactor is as good as it looks in the trailer, however I would have really loved a fully sandbox mode where you can customize the bike to the top tear stuff and play around with some kind of track creation tool. The career mode is well made and I love that you can get sponsorships, it really feels like I'm making my way up the ranks in the motocross world. All in all a very good motocross game.

I love sliding my back tire into a berm and popping the clutch to speed away. Works really well in this game. Overall I have been having a lot of fun.Pros: Physics are quite good         Graphics are sharp, especially on the bike and rider         Competition is well balanced, good challenge, have to ride pretty flawless to win on Pro and aboveCons: Horrific bike sounds, kills the reality          Bike reset when barely going off track in some places, which is very annoying          No Bell helmet brand (not a big deal)          Easy crash when contact is made with another rider on a turn          Probably not optimized the best, occaional stutter/fps drop once in awhile (I have gtx 980 Ti)Overall I feel if you are a Supercross/Motocross fan this is worth getting.

												The motocross game i've been waiting for! Honestly did not think to much of it at the start with the stock bike, it was overturning way to much even with adjusted suspension settings etc it still just felt very sluggy and the engine sounded like a hotted up tractor engine....Until you upgrade your bike. What a game changer that is let me tell you! Everything changes from the handling to the engine sounds, most of the physics have been changed and mostly for the better imo. Multiplayer works fantasticly besides the odd didsconnect here and there and the leaderboards seem to be working fine with no hackers as of yet. Graphics have been improved and different textures on the tracks which is nice for a scenery change, the AI have been re worked and are much more of a challenge now - get ready for some epic MX racing! Just give this game some time if you do are not liking it at first and play around with some settings. Cya in the multiplayer for some racing!			",84,3,10,9,13,2,17

												Having played MXGP and loved it, I was very excited to play MXGP 2. Several swear words and a broken controller later, I have some conclusions. It is great. It's better than the first. The handling is different and at times can seem a touch too sensitive, but once you get used to it, it really is nice. The whips and scrubs are slightly improved. The new layout is a bit add at first, but again, once you get used to it, it's fine. The game runs pretty smoothly, with only a slight hiccup here and there. It is nowhere near as bad as MX vs ATV Encore was (that game did get a decent patch to fix most problems). There are new tracks and some from the previous game have been removed.  Of course, most Americans (like myself) will probably wish there were more US tracks, but this is MXGP after all and not Lucas Oil Nationals. Thankfully Glen Helen is now on the schedule and most of the removed tracks are ones I didn't care much for anyway. The addition of the MXON is nice, although I'm a little disappointed that I cannot use my custom team in it. Oh well, at least I can represent USA and create the ending I would have preferred for last year's race. The indoor races are more Arenacross than Supercross. They are very tight and by the end of it you will probably hate Nagl, Febvre, and Gajser. Maybe it's a good thing they don't have the license for the US series. The AI is improved and takes much better lines. I still have yet to bump it back up to the highest setting, but they are definitely more aggresive. Again, you'll probably end up hating quite a few guys. The only problem is a lot of times inside passes result in tipovers from the AI, although this seems to be true in most MX games. Overall, I wish there were a few things different, such as first-person starts and the clutch assignment not locking up the game, but this series is well on it's way and with any luck, maybe, just maybe, one day there will be an installment for the US series.

												This game offers a level of depth that was missing in the MX vs. ATV series and I think it's an excellent addition. A lot of hard work and effort must have gone into this game and it sets a new standard for how motocross games should present themselves. HOWEVER--the most unforgivable aspect about this game is how it FEELS. Everything is floaty, slow, lethargic and numb. I don't ever FEEL like I'm going fast. No matter what bike, setup, track, I feel slow even in first place and this ruins the entire game. For a game trying so hard to emulate reality I don't know how they could have forgotten what speed feels like. The developers need to throw a leg over a motocross bike some time so they can truly understand what I'm conveying here. Neck-snapping acceleration... WHERE THE F*$% IS IT?!			",22,7,4,1,4,1,1

												This game offers a level of depth that was missing in the MX vs. ATV series and I think it's an excellent addition. A lot of hard work and effort must have gone into this game and it sets a new standard for how motocross games should present themselves. HOWEVER--the most unforgivable aspect about this game is how it FEELS. Everything is floaty, slow, lethargic and numb. I don't ever FEEL like I'm going fast. No matter what bike, setup, track, I feel slow even in first place and this ruins the entire game. For a game trying so hard to emulate reality I don't know how they could have forgotten what speed feels like. The developers need to throw a leg over a motocross bike some time so they can truly understand what I'm conveying here. Neck-snapping acceleration... WHERE THE F*$% IS IT?!			",22,7,4,1,4,1,1

												Έχουμε να κάνουμε μ’ έναν τίτλο που κυκλοφορεί ανά διετία και που η δημιουργός εταιρεία φρόντισε να βελτιώσει αρκετά, εισακούοντας τις προτάσεις των παικτών, δίχως την ίδια στιγμή να πειράξει κάτι που δούλευε καλά στους προκατόχους του. Το MXGP2 πιθανώς είναι συνολικά το καλύτερο motocross videogame που έχουμε δει μέχρι σήμερα.A perfect example of how one studio can improve a game, based on the players’ remarks, without ruining anything of the elements that worked well on its previous versions. MXGP2 is possibly the best motocross videogame until today. http://ragequit.gr/reviews/item/mxgp2-the-official-motocross-videogame-pc-review ",233,220,15,1,4,3,6

												Game is ok. Pretty much the  same it seems you have more power but if you over jump badly youll continue on like you landed perfectly on the downside of the jump. Youll need a pretty good pc with a good fast processor and the nividia 750ti to start with to get good graphics. Handling is different but good. I really think you'll get better game experience on the ps4. I have the first mxgp on ps4 and its really good and you'll have to have a pretty good graphics card to get ps4 graphics. Nice menu and customization. (After playing more MXGP 2 is better, graphics are better still need somewhat strong pc to see really how good they are but its more challenging i really like cant wait to get it on ps4.) great job milestone!

												After watching the Announcement trailer and waiting for this game to come out, i can finally say that i am not dissapointed.First of all, I must say that the game mechanics are great! They feel like the closest to actual racing than any other motocross game I have played. You really do have to plan your lines ahead and make sure you are applying the right braking style around certain corners. I haven't played the first MXGP, but i have played games like MX vs. ATV: Reflex and the movements feel much more realistic and passing people actually feels like an accomplishment. I also find it pretty cool that when you lean, you reallly have to be careful because lean to much and you are in the dirt. The customization options are an awesome factor as well. I was almost able to perfectly recreate my own Yamaha with American flag graphics! There are so many brands to choose from includ Fox, FMF, and Renthal. The only problem i ran into while customizing my bike was a constant flickering that would appear on the bike, but the developers are already aware through discussions and are probably already fixing it. My favorite mode so far is the Career mode, where you get to race with the MXGP 2015 Roster. Although i don't really follow those races as I like to watch AMA Supercross in America, I am having a blast making my own character and bringing him up in the ranks. Graphics-wise the game looks and runs great with my fps staying between 50-60fps on the max settings.  Here are my specs:i7 4790kAMD Radeon R9290x 4gb16gb RamThe most common complaint that i do find relevent is the sounds of the game. The engine noises are not up to par and can be made more realistic as well as maybe the crashes. However, this problem does not take my enjoyment away from the game and shouldn't be the deciding factor in purchasing the game or not in my opinion. Overall, the gameplay is stellar but that is not to say that there are things that could be worked on. I definitely recommend this game to fans of the sport or anyone that enjoys realistic racing games. Cheers! ",50,4,4,5,4,2,0

												This is a great racing game.I know what motoX is but I'm not a follower, I bought it because I was looking for a racer and it has has good reviews. Pros:Great physics with a real sense of intertia.Good controls, remappable and intuitive with an xbox controller.Really interesting real world tracks with distinct character.Different track surfaces require different technique.Good learning curve.Windowed mode.Looks really good and still ok fps when settings are lowered for graphically demanding tracks.Cons:Limited graphical options, only available in the launcher.Some tracks are more demanding than others, causing framerate drops until exit and restart to launcher to modify options.Some gameplay elements seem a little pointless, there are a lot of upgrade options that are identical other than in appearance. Maybe this will appeal to fans of the sport more.Comments:This feels like a simpler original Wip3out or RC Stunt Copter, and I feel that is high praise. The solid inertia feel and the gameplay are really solid and worthy of recommendation alone. Perhaps the AI is a little easy to beat (I haven't and probably won't play multiplayer) but the satisfaction that can be gained by learning lines and getting them right make this well worth the money if you're a fan of solid no-nonsense racers. Just ignore the plethora of identical bike upgrades.			",48,11,8,9,12,1,11

												I am really enjoying this game, IMO I am finding it harder than MXGP. The computer is more challenging so i feel like there will be a lot of time in the game to achieve being really good, from changing the AI difficulty to the rider reflex options. The choice in brands from bikes to gear is really cool, the tracks look better. Still a few glitches from engine cut out and the AI just runs you over like its nothing. The career is fun so far and SX tracks are challenging, the game tends to be twitchy at times IMO. I will put plenty of hours in the game trying to get better and unlock everything.

												This game feels unfinished and buggy. I have a gtx 960 and an i7 and it isnt very smooth. Also can't change the physics? If an AI and I hit a jump at the same speed, they go twice the distance?Crashing feels like russian roulette.. you have no idea when its going to happen. The slightest mistep off the track and you are reset. Also there is a bug with the settings screen, I can't change my video settings and milestone is not responding.Spent 55 bucks on this game and I would rather play the original mxgp.

												Simply amazing. If you enjoyed the 1st MXGP game then you'll love the improvements they made. If you didn't like the first one I suggest you go into it with an open mind. It's similar but it isn't just an update, it has it's own character. Things that could be improved on: AI - Collisions are not fantastic, it's forgivable but it does take away a bit from the experience. Also the AI is just slow. They're programmed to take slower lines which in turn makes the ""realistic"" difficulty not very realistic.Multiplayer - Unreliable. Because it doesn't use dedicated servers your experience is effected by your internet connection. It also loses connection 70% of the time.That being said the game is fantastic. The graphics are beautiful and the customization is really what the 1st title was missing. The career mode is everything I had hoped for after the improvements they made in their MotoGP series that I loved so much. It improves on the base set in 2014 and worth the pickup for any moto fan.			",64,3,32,3,23,1,3

												The game is fun, and I would recommend it to anybody who enjoys motocross, but there is one big problem I keep having. The problem is when you get stuck in the back of the pack, passing other riders on the inside is nearly impossible. If you get to close to them you automatically fall down for no reason. The other rider doesn't even move and you fall losing at least a few positions. I'm not sure why this happens because in real life, if you get to the inside of another rider, they will be pushed wide and you'll get the position with no issues. The reason that I find this a problem in game is because moving up through the pack is not realistic and everytime you get the position on another rider in the corner, your guy just falls off and it ruins the race. If you can get out front early, it's not difficult.			",5,0,9,0,4,1,0

												Game would be awesome if the bike didn't feel so heavy to move from side to side, frame rate drops are a massive issue also. Making the AI slightly more collision intelligent going into the first corner like on motoGP would be a plus.

												I am really enjoying this game. it is basically like the first MXGP except that there are more tracks and updated rosters. the physics are pretty much the same as the first game which i am OK with. the only negative thing i can think of is the fact that they changed the whips. now you have to move the bike and the person i opposite directions to o a whip. its just kinda awkward and not very realistic. i understand why they did it like that but i still wish there was an option to switch it back. ve this game a 7/10 because its basically just a really big update for MXGP but is still a ton of fun.

												Feels like a quicktime event, but for racing.Pros:-Authentic teams, bikes and schedules give a good authentic motocross feeling. -Tracks look amazing and there's a lot! Fun to ride, scale works well.-Customisation of bike and rider has been enhanced since MXGP1 (would like to see more brands though)-Sponsor system still in place.Cons:-SOUND.... I once had a dvd player that sounded more like a bike than this.-Speed of the bikes and gearing seem well off... 1st gear is like running pace, no sensation of acceleration through the range what so ever.-Ridged as a bread stick while jumping... Scubbing is okay I guess, nothing amazing. Cannot control pitch in a way that feels true to jumping a real bike.-Block passing or merely just riding on the inside of AI will force you to crash. (needs fixing)-Supercross (or stadiumcross) is horrible.Overall:I bought this knowing how fun the first game was, doing the seasons over and having battles while the AI was still difficult but MXGP2 has taken that all away. While the tracks and graphics are better, the main core of the game is still broken but this time I can't bare to even complete a full season. BUY? No, wait for a patch to see if any of these things have been fixed but don't hold your breath on Milestone delivering support.			",82,26,5,6,17,0,9

Posted: April 8, 2016
												Very disappointed in this game..... I really loved MXGP1 for the most part and was excited for the release of this game......until I installed it last night. The game will not assign/map our buttons with my Logitech controller properly.....If I try to assign button 1 for the gas, the game randomly assigns a different button on screen....then in gameplay, it is an entirely button. This also happened in MXGP1 and I was really hoping this game would be different. It also wont let you assign a new button for the clutch......it just locks the game and you have to do a force shutdown to back out. I did this 4 times before giving up. The bike also turns very sensitive and zig zags all over the track uncontrollably. I have a high end gaming PC and this game is choppy and laggy. I can run Fallout 4, Call of Duty, Far Cry all on max settings with zero lag but this game lags badly. For this release, you guys should have knocked it out of the park but instead you gave us MXGP1 with better tracks.  The bike physics(turning wise) was 100% better on the first game. The sounds are also awful. Not sure why you could not update this more.......This game is full of bugs and I can't believe you would release this. You need to come up with some fixes and patches and help us out here.   The tracks all look great.......it's a shame I can't play the game......PLEASE FIX THE ISSUES WITH MAPPING OUT THE CONTROLS!!!!!!			",9,0,5,1,0,0,0

												I thought the problem was my logitech controller, but it wasn't. The issue is latency when I use the controller. turning is ridiculous, I zig zag all over the track. When I turn, about 30ms later, the bike turns. I let off, about 30ms later, the bike straightens out and heads off the track. This does not happen on mxgp1, and the computer is 3.4Ghz i7 quad, 8GB ram, 2GB nvidia. As of right now, after 4 hours of messing with it, the game is not playable.Not to mention that it is extremely demanding on graphics and cpu. The above specs only get me 1024x768 resolution without lagging.Again, the first mxgp didn't have this problem.If Milestone addresses the issue, I will keep the game and install whatever updates they put out, but if they ignore it I will be returning the game.

												let's cut the negativity, obviously a lot of these people havent put the same hours in the 1st game i have.(2nd game actually if you count Mud FIM world championship motocross)I really feel the difference between the last game's physics and this one, also when i change the suspension settings the bike feels a lot better then in mxgp(1) . I also get the idea that the jump shapes are a lot better, alot more immersive when u feel the rear spiring propel you up in the air.The tracks don't tend to become 'unridable' after a large amount of laps. In mxgp tracks would be a totally destroyed after 3 laps especially in the sand.It was terrible all traction was gone and the track felt like soup or whatever but regretfully still no realistic deformation system. Although it feels 100% better then last game, a real improvement on how the type of soil feels under you'r bike.And also how the track shapes up during a moto. This subject will still need an insane amount of work to even come close to realism, but if we keep this line of improvement up it will be sooner then you'd think. Still whipping and air movement is not excactly up to par yet but has also came a long way from last game at least it's funcional right now. Im maybe to used to MX-simulator a lil to much, i so love the freedom you have in the air in that game.The A.I. has got a lil faster aswell nothing shocking but sometimes when i fall i don't win at least on a stock bike. it's just that they only ride one line and if they wheel tap you you'r going down. Als when you try to take inside line and block pass, you go down. The AI just don't seem to slow down or even take you into account, also they seem to weigh a lot more then you do thus you are alway's the victim.It still needs a lot of work to be closer to realism.the rewind thingey is not for me but i get that some people will like it. I would really like to a more competetive A.I. still.The sounds is one one of most talked about things by people so imma leave that out. :)It has to be said that on sometimes like in Neuquen when u jump down into that left handed roller section, it has a frame drop and not just at the start every single lap. It's really annoying and has to be fixed if you ask me. Also the Multiplayer is not working (yet), i tryed to make an account but i dont get the activation emailare you guys at Milestone gonna fix this? After i while i did find out that the confirmation mail for the acount is only sent to G-mail acounts for some reason...So if you wanna play get a G-mail acount or wait for Milestone to fix this.All in all i think the progress made by Milestone in between games is awesome,still it's not the perfect motocross game.But at least the line is moving up instead of MX vs Atv Supercross which i don't even wanna talk about.I'm looking for great things to come in the future but for now i'm satisfied with what this game has brought me so far.

I rate this game 8.5/10 until they can add 2-strokes. Great graphics and they changed the originals tracks a little bit by making them a little more stretched out and open. Definitly feels like a great game while playing, worth $50.00!			",45,2,8,0,5,0,3

												At first the game was very frustrating because you start out on a slow stock bike and get smoked if you play on Hard or Realistic. After Doing a few races and earning some credits I modded out a bike and I am having a lot more fun with the game. I like how they have all the brand names of aftermarket parts, Pro Circuit, Renthal, Ohlins etc. I am running an i5 4690k CPU with a GTX 970 GPU and I can max out everything and get no frame drops. The physics are like the first game but seem a bit more refined, you can't just go hauling♥♥♥♥♥into a corner and power your way out. You have to brake, lean and get on the gas with good timing. My only complaint so far is the AI, they always take the inside line and they never checkup if you try and take the line away from them. They just ram you and you end up on the ground as they ride away. It also seems like the AI doesn't spread out very much from 1st to 22nd place, last place crosses the line only 15-20 seconds after first place. I don't know what races the devs are watching but I don't think 1st place and 22nd have ever finished that close IRL. This means if you fall you get passed by a ton of guys. I was playing on Hard difficulty, running second place behind Herlings and I fell, got back up in 11th. I was pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Overall the game is fun and should have pretty good replay value, especially for moto fans. PLEASE ADD SOME REAL EXHAUST SOUND EFFECTS!! ",7,0,4,0,1,0,0

												This is a overall good game, runs very strong and im sure i will definitley play it for a while but the only thing i wish more in the game curremtly is the sounds and customization. Im saying this because the sounds are nothing close to a motorcycle and there isnt even a rev limiter and its a 4-stroke. most of you probaly dont notice or anything because you just like racing or kinda arcadish games and are not comepletly a serious motocross person who knows all about bikes and stuff. But those who are more serious about it probaly know what im trying to say. It just realy takes away from the games with sounds that dont even correspond with anything. I realy hope there will eventualy be a mod team that can add to what im getting at. Like for example, mxsimulator not the best graphics but is also an old game. it is still realy fun and there are still mod teams that make bikes in it and graphics and sound mods to make the game completly seem new or different in a better way. i realy hope some members from gp can understand or for there next game even add things in the sound catagory and im sure over time they will add more to the coustumiztion category in the game. Thanks :)			",28,2,4,2,7,0,0

												Well ive been excited to get this game, excited to play, and excited to put alot of hours into it... unfortanutely that wont be happening.To start, the game runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥ With a $1300 computer you would except it to run even half decent. But on ultra low graphics it still is choppy and lags.Second, It feels like just a big update to the game that added a new rider, 2 new sx tracks and some new customizations. Nothing has improved.Next, the physics seem to have gotten worse. After the whole 30 mins of playing i realized that it is nearly impossible to make a sharp corner, and the whips are very odd to pull off.After such an amazing first game (MXGP) you would except this to be even better, but nope. I am very dissapointed with Milestone.I will be holding onto this game for another week or two and if there are no improvements in the gameplay i will be requesting a refund.Final Review - 5/10 - Just buy MXGP			",6,1,3,0,3,0,0

												If you're a motocross fan and love moto games this is for you. Handling is a lot different from MX Vs ATV Series. The handling is good. What I love the most is the Career mode and how much customization you can do to your bike and outfits its cool since it's real brands instead of made up stuff. I really enjoy it personally.

Started playing and temp went up to 79*c and was steadly rising, and crashed my computer. So I tried again, but this time turning off all the high res. graphics, tire marks, and putting other settings at medium. And the same thing happended again. So I turned it down to 720, and same thing again. Can not play game at all. I want my money back.Fx-8350 oc to 4.4Msi r9-390x16gb 2133 ramWD 1tb Black hdd			",55,11,25,2,16,0,1

												After a few hours of gameplay and a first season of the career almost completed, it is time to drafta review for MXGP2. I'll start with the graphics: motorbikes and pilots are well reproduced, the motorbikes in particular look very detailed and gorgeous when covered with mud. the tracks are well designed, whereas the crowd and the details on the side don't look very convincing. The overall impression is that itmay not be the most advanced game in therms of graphics, but it's still pleasant to look at and it is stable and fluid. The sound effects are ok, I don't have experience with this kind of motorbikes so I don't really know how accurate their sound reproduction is. The gameplay is a bit arcadey, and is fun: touching with others is not to punishing and they don't seem stupid. With a bit of practice you'll soon start to take the difficulty level and physics level up for a more challenging experience. I find ridiculous, even if it is really not a big issue, that you can change direction while flying after a jump, like super mario.The game offers a good variety of game modes, ensuring thus a lasting experience. I am still doing the first part of the career, which is fine, I hope that at any point something spectacular will come out, like for example the 24h of Le Mans in GRID, to provide a climax of some sort.In conclusion, I think MXGP2 might not be super impressive at first but is a good game with lots of fun for many hours.

												4.5/10 for this game. Here's my reasoning.After spending a fair bit of time on the game already, the career layout is really well done. I like the weekend proceedings of each event, and it's an enjoyably realistic aspect of the game. The graphics are also very good, on par with any of the MVA games IMO. The aspect that fails massively, is the physics engine. I guess it's ok if you're into Motocross Madness 1 and ♥♥♥♥in Mario Kart? Feels like i'm riding a brick on two wheels and trying to drift it around corners. There's not much control that I can have in air, and it's very sluggish in response. Overall, it's a fun game for someone who hasn't touched MX Simulator, but in comparison to a game of that caliber, it's extremely arcade-ish in feel in contrast. Suggestions for this game would be to perhaps use a physics engine that's a cross between MX Sim and MVA Reflex? Something with some more control of the bike placement while in-air, while still needing to be careful with throttle control in ruts etc.If I'd tried this game before i bought it I'd have waited until it was ♥♥♥♥in $2.25 on special. That's all I'm saying.I'm not a smoker, have a low-sugar diet, and dont spend prolonged time in the sun, but I think it was all for nothing, because this game may have given me terminal cancer anyway.

												I'm not much of a Motorbike person but I decided to buy this on a whim for something different. I was really surprised how much fun I am actually having with this game. I am mainly playing career mode and having a blast. I like having to work my way up from the lower class while upgrading my bike and rider (there is a lot of customisation here). I started out having trouble winning on Medium but I have now put it on hard as I have gotten better at the game which is a testement in itself. If you learn the tracks and how to ride properly you will get better results.I love this game, it's alot of fun!			",166,24,9,13,9,4,22
