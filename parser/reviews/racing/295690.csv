Particle Mace is a masterful lesson in game design that with its perfect scoring system and haunting beautiful abstract world will put you in some sort of hypnotic trance. While you leave your mind behind you, tracing circles like in a Sufi whirling dance ritual. One of the most captivating game experiences since Tetsuya Mizoguchi’s Rez, that gives a true meaning to the expression videogames as an art formIn my first 5 minutes with Particle Mace, I wasn’t so impressed. Sure, the main mechanic was original and a brilliant twist respect to the typical twin stick shooter. But I wasn’t able to understand why it was the favorite game for some of my most beloved friends. But after I spent half an hour with it, when I dominated its psychics mechanics and I understood its scoring system realizing the masterful and completely perfect game design behind it, I became anxious.I felt my pulse accelerated with each heartbeat sending unconscious signals to my mind. Full of binary coded verses talking about the overwhelming sense of beauty suspended in the abstract and almost ethereal world behind Particle Mace.It’s the same sense of accomplishment that you can feel when you meet for the first time a lifetime love, this person who you will spend some of your more pleasant and intimate moments. Sometimes this tempestuous love will induce you to obfuscation, making you to feel a bit dumb about yourself for every bad step taken in your relationship, this meteor that you stupidly crashed while you were concentrated trying to evade a pursuing enemy’s red ship. But then you reconcile with it and the previously induced rage only takes you to a next and much more passionate encounter in which you have a better understanding of every particle in its body, allowing you to achieve a higher score.Sometimes, Particle Mace is a meditative experience that puts you in some sort of state of trance while you are tracing circles at a constant pace that flows like a mantra. An experience similar to a Sufi whirling dance ritual in which the participants are able to elevate his minds from his bodies through the constant act of swirling with the rhythm of the music.At other times, Particle Mace turns into a fast pace and frantic arcade experience with the screen inundated with menacing objects floating in the vastness of space. And you feel inside of a space opera, while you maneuver your ship tracing impossible parables. Creating complex strategies to destroy the enemy ships, trying to not lose the momentum while you increase even more an epic chain of explosions.It has a perfectly crafted level design, that like Nintendo’s most beloved classics, works on a two-dimensional level of complexity. There is a first layer in the game that makes it instantly pleasant to play only to be absorbed in its universe, being an experience close to meditation and with a main mechanic that is instantly fun. And then comes with its second layer of complexity, because the better you learn its level structure, scoring system and enemies patterns, the more you can improve your runs in a competitive way. In each run you can feel your progress, how you have a better knowledge of the game rules every time. At the end, destroying the enemies becomes an instinctive reflex skill.Particle Mace is a game almost eternal. Its three main infinite modes are truly differentiated among them. Each mode has a completely different layout with a diverse range of challenges that can immensely alter the gameplay. And every layout is in a constant change. The more you score, the more new elements are included. Its level of creativity is incredible, slowly introducing new ideas, patterns and obstacles.And then you have a glorious 150 missions mode that constantly amazes you with new design ideas, new menaces, new rules. This mode exhibits a level of ingenuity in its construction that is on par with the constant sense of surprise and novelty found in each of the levels of Super Mario Galaxy. With Particle Mace, Andy Wallace reveals himself as one of the better videogame designers of his generation.And all of this is embraced with one of the most beautiful and evocative abstract worlds seen since Tetsuya Mizoguchi’s Rez. The game is enveloped by a special sense of loneliness, an intense feeling of melancholy and introspection that can let us spend hundred of hours in it, while we’re absorbed in a universe constructed via suspended and ethereal backgrounds. A feeling that is intensified thanks to a hypnotic soundtrack that rises in a perfect crescendo to highlight the most action packed moments.Particle Mace is one of these games that like Rez years before, makes that you couldn’t conceive a single hard work day that not end in feeling for a mere instant its abstract beauty while you are immersed in the still of the night. Captivating your soul and showing you the true meaning of the expression videogames as an art form.( The writer of this review is not an English native. So you should expect occasional grammar errors. I apologize in advance. ) ",654,347,7,89,29,3,33

												DISCLAIMER: I was given a key for free by the publisher!Don't let the minimalist graphics and the easy pick-up and play game mechanics fool you, this little at first glance casual style arena-based (area-based, where you have to stay in a defined space that will eventually start moving and change shape) smash enemies and asteroids game has the potential to let you become hooked. Whether you are going for high scores in the 3 arcade modes (easy, hard, asteroids) or try to do special objectives in mission mode, I find myself easily trying over and over again.This is a definitve recommendation: simple gameplay mechanics, high replayabilty and easy addiction!

												This is one of those games you don't need much time to get the full taste.It's a mix of Geometry Wars and Astroid, except with a heavy dose of physics.If you're an achievement hunter, be sure you have another person to play with, or at least a controller, as at least 7 achievements require Co-op or deathmatches and sadly multiplayer is local only.Controls are very tricky and will take time to get use to.Seems like a fun game to mess around or kill time, and the missions do get gradually harder.Personally I'm rather indifferent about it, mainly because of the local co-op only achievements that really unease me... for now I'll pick yes but this may change to a no later in the future if needed.-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish.

Early Access Review
								PARTICLE MACE is a frantic blast of space trash smash'emup action where you will spin it to win it. The elegant movements of your ship are like a ballet of geometrical anarchy. In the same way that games like Nidhogg bring the local multiplayer insanity to the platforming brawler genres, PARTICLE MACE brings the same level of abstract and chaotic couch co-op to the action arcade genre.The controls and the physics revolving around your cluster of tethered space garbage really hit the nail on the head. There's a serious feeling of weight to the mace you're swinging around as you swerve to each side trying to get it's momentum going, and when you do it feels very natural. There are different ships of different speeds to accommodate each and every play style, ranging from the super slow ship with a large and effective particle mace to the extremely fast and speedy ship with a longer and harder to control mace.Getting into the groove of the game is a very zen-like experience, becoming lost in the motions of your ship weaving in and out of clusters of asteroids. The movement of your chosen ship feels incredibly fluid and responsive, giving you the edge you need to navigate through the narrowest of passages in-between asteroids and your intimidating red foes.The multiplayer co-op is where PARTICLE MACE really shines as it isn't just the simple addition of new players on the screen, but features some discoverable techniques like the combining of Maces or the revival of fallen teammates floating by helplessly which will require the full coordination of each participating player.Even in it's early stages there's already a whole slew of really great modes and options you would expect from a polished full release, including the progressive mission mode which dishes out a series of unique and increasingly harder tasks to take on  that will earn you new ships, à la Luftrausers. Although seemingly simple on the surface, PARTICLE MACE is a huge game with incredible polish and an almost infinite learning curve, making this one hell of an addictive ride to pick up and play for the shortest bursts of play to the longest couch co-op jam sessions.

												This game is more entertaining than I first thought. The missions and unlocks are motivating. The different ships (or at least some of them) have their uses depending on the situation, mission and scenario. And the soundtrack is indeed quite good, even though I generally don't like electric sounds ;-)Note: I received this game in a package with great discount. I'm not sure if it's worth 10 bucks.

												I found this game at a gaming con set up in an arcade cabinet in the indie section, and my friends and I found ourselves hooked into the night. A fantastic local multiplayer game.  Each player has a spaceship that drags weapons behind it on elastic tethers, with the goal being to fling your ""net"" into the other players.  The physics on the tethers is spot-on, and makes for frenetic couch play.  Definitely recommended!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really cool little asteroid-arcade game which is very unique. However, I bought this game while it was on sale and I don't think I would've bought it for its usual price. Is it a enjoyable and fun game? Yes.Is it worth buying? If you're just splurging on money, sure, but the novelty of the game somewhat wears off after a while and it is pretty short despite the replayability.			",69,15,1,6,6,0,7

Not sure if he can do anything about it as apparently it's up to the rights holder on Steam.**ADDITIONAL UPDATE: They've now removed the launcher.  My progress is still lost, though.

												I don't usually write reviews, but I love this game. You know how sometimes you're just looking for a good, cheap game that you can sink your teeth into right away without having to think too much about it? A game that has an interesting new mechanic and is instantly addictive? This is that game. It takes about five seconds to learn the basics, and then it grabs you--that whole whip-the-mace-at-rocks-and-ships thing.For those who don't know: Imagine chunks of space junk tethered (by bungie cords) to an agile spaceship. The trick is to, with a single thumbstick, use the ship's momentum and direction to fling those tethered chunks like a mace and pulverize asteroids and enemy ships. (Yes, there is a local, four-player muiltiplayer mode.) It's simply divine.While it is inspired by arcade classics, it instantly sets itself apart. There's a whole lot of variety here for just a few bucks. This is that game you'll play as your warm-up for a marathon session of some bigger, grander game. Only...you'll probably look up after a few hours and realize that you spent all your time flinging the PARTICLE MACE.WARNING: Like a lot of folks, I was disappointed about the lack of Steam Controller support. I'm glad I took the time to dig up my old Xbox 360 controller, but this omission is unfortunate.Still, to quote Doug McKenzie: ""...all in all, a good five dollars worth for me and my whole family.""

												Particle Mace is actually pretty hard. The physics of flinging around the ""Mace"" attached to your ship is pretty difficult. One would think that this translates well to a mouse, but it actually seems to work better with a controller. The game runs fine and the music is nice, but the difficulty will probably keep me from putting an obscene ammount of hours into it. The challenge modes are pretty fun, and the 4 player multiplayer is where this game can really shine for couch gaming.  In all honesty, the 4 player couch action is the game's saving grace. I'd personally recomend going for this on sale, and looking at it as a multiplayer game for your buds. -PR0XIDIAN			",912,138,59,85,56,7,110

But not something to go back to a lot :)The multiplayer part is also rather cool but does get boring after a while. Maybe something fun to do in a coffee break but not too much.TLDR; A fun and small game to play and I will definitively play more, but not worth the full price. Still thumbs up(Y)!

												Fluidly and beautifully smash geometry to bits with elegant physics.This game is pretty much the hidden gem in the current Indiegala Monday bundle. The game mechanics are deceptively simple: use any stick on your gampad to move your spaceship in any direction. The weights attached to the lines will then accelerate (rotate around you if you do it right) and smash things; but don't try that with your ship, because then you will be smashed. There are few different setups of spaceship mass, speeds and weight/line arrangements, and some do require different tactics. I tried this game out in local MP (it seats 4 players, though we tried it with two), and it really shines there: co-op is well done, and death match is fun, especially if you're using different ship types. I'm not certain I can say the same for the single-player ""campaign"", which comes down to doing 150 mini-""missions"" (aka achievements); consider it ""practice mode"".Immediately awesome. It's not a big game by any means, but well worth any small price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												(5/5 star) I really enjoy this game.  Controls work great (xbox 360 gamepad) & responsive, great tutorial, and has a good amount of incentive to keep playing.  There are 3 levels (normal, hard, astroid) to play for your highest score, and the gameplay is fun enough to keep you trying for a little bit.  There are ships with different characteristics to unlock, which change how you might play the levels.  And what keeps me engaged are the 150 missions that vary things up to meet some objective, like kill 5 enemies within a circle around the starting point, or kill a certain number of astroids, or don't kill anything for a certain amount of time, etc.  There is a decent amount of variety to the missions, and then they increase the mission level.  This is a surprisingly competent game.  I am very happy that I gave this a shot.Plays great on my Windows 10 Alienware Alpha on my 47"" TV with an xbox360 gamepad.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								Really liking this game. Still in early access, but lots on enjoyment to be had. It fills a ""quick, easy, twin-stick-ish, unique arcade game"" hole that I had in my heart/library.Pros:-The controls are very tight and the ""mace"" responds as expected -Good variation ""ships""-Game modes are entertaining: easy, hard, asteroid field, challenges-Unlocks give you something to strive for if a new high score is not enough.  -And unlock goals are set well; high, but not too high.-Music is atmospheric and fits nicely.  -The sounds and graphics make it feel retro, but still polished.-Leaderboads makes a lot of sense-The gameplay keeps you coming back to do better / change strategies / destroy all the things. ""just one more time""-Have not tried multiplayer yet-Developers hosted a high score competition with prizes! How cool is that!-On mac so even my silly iFriends can play too.-Great pricepoint! Possible improvements:-Other game modes could be added for further variety (time attack/pacifism)-Could add some customization for difficulty/ease multipliers: set number of particles/asteroid density/enemy strength/ etc.-An ""adventure"" mode to pick up more particles/ gain shields/ pseudo bosses?-Power ups?Excited to see what is yet to come! 8/10 ",196,67,4,14,31,2,27

Arcade(Survival+Endless mode), Co-op Arcade, Deathmatch and 150 missions/Levels.This is Local Co-op up to 4 players.About the game.You play with a ship that has a wrecking ball around him. You have to move your ship in order to move the wrecking ball. You will have to kill targets with your wrecking ball by swinging it around. While the game is easy to understand with easy controls, It isn't easy to hit objects with the wrecking ball. Sometimes this could be even frustating too. But the game idea is totally there.  There are like 150 missions with each of their own objective. Like ""kill this within 5 secs"" or ""stay here for 15 secs"" and so go on.Game controls are good.Music is alright.Graphics is okay.Hitbox is perfectly accurate.There is a small tutorial.There is a difficulty settings.Local Co-op up to 4 players. (Xbox controller required)Other things.Alot of colorful objects. If it starts to hurt your eyes, then turn on the color blind mode.-------------------I Give this game a 6/10 ",469,170,6,45,49,1,62

												A fabulous game for those who love the arcade style. I have it in my ""relax"" category for when I need to start winding down for the night. It's fun, and the physics are unique. As someone who loves physics games, I couldn't resist purchasing it just to try it out. And although I got it on sale, I would purchase it at full price today if I knew it was going to be that good.If you are looking for a simple yet fun arcade game, play it. If you're looking for the ""ultimate gaming experience"", you might be looking down the wrong alley.I'll be playing this game for a long time.			",95,12,4,3,4,0,4

												I've bought it on sale and thought it will be boring, I just wanted some cards. Now I know I was wrong, because this game is pure fun! Physics in this game are incredibly good. As you can know from title, you don't deal with your opponents and asteroids with guns, but with a mace. And that's a really interesting idea, which is really good. There's so many levels and quests, that I haven't finished the game, but I'll probably do it in future. I haven't notice any bugs or errors, it's just perfectly made game! I haven't tried multiplayer mode yet, but I think you should. I really didn't know that I'll have so much fun with this type of game! I highly recommend it. Have fun with this game!P.S. I'm not a native english speaker, so I'm sorry if I made some grammatical errors.			",251,70,8,26,13,0,34

												A good casual game, but not worth the full price. Wait till it is on sale before you buyAlso the game has a terrible fps lock of about 22fps, which is awful for pc games, and with this particular title, causes very large problems every now and again because, though very rarely, the game will unlock for a micro-second, causing it to speed up, and this has caused me to crash into asteroids, and therfore fail missions quite commonly.This really needs a 60fps update in order to be properly playable on pc			",119,5,8,6,7,0,0

Review - PARTICLE MACE""I never knew how wonderful physics can be!""    PARTICLE MACE is a physics arcade game where you try to reach a specific goal/objective by controlling a ship with some particles attached to it. Basically, you try to apply your knowledge of physics to be able to manipulate and master the control of the particles. The particles can destroy your enemies and asteroids but still, your victory will still depend on the game objectives. This game also features a multiplayer mode.    Don't let the graphics deceive you. The game's flawless physics is what makes this game so good and so addicting to play. If you've got some money to spare, this game can gob up some of your idle hours. I recommend it to players who loves minigames like Beyond Gravity.Personal Rating:Gameplay: 9/10 (Replayability is totally high)Music: 8/10Story: n/aGraphics: 7/10Overall: 8/10			",99,66,2,18,11,3,15

-Quick Review-PARTICLE MACE is an indie-2d-space-ship game that plays like ""asteroids"", only instead of going pew pew, you go swish swish, you swing particles behind your ship to smash asteroids and enemy ships.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: There isn't much of a developed story, supposedly everyone is dead and now you're the only survivor in a ship trying to survive. (Good thing they let me respawn though. Because if I didn't get to respawn all hope would be lost because this game take a bit of getting used too)Gameplay: PARTICLE MACE was inspired by old classic video games, ergo it feels very much like a classic video game. While still very challenging and difficult, the game feels far more playable then classic video games because this game can actually be beat! (props to all of you classic video game deities, we all want to be like you, only with a real life too.)As I have already eluded too, you don't have laser “pew pew” weapons, instead you have pixels holding on to the back of your ship for dear life, you need to use these “particles” to smash into objects to do damage for you. As the game itself says “you use these games like a Mace” Thus the name “PARTICLE MACE”.There are a few different game modes; Missions, Asteroids, Easy, and hard. Each game mode plays a little differently.Personally I enjoyed trying to finish the Missions the most, you always have 3 different missions that you can try to accomplish in one attempt, or just get one of them and it'll shuffle to a new mission.The game mode ""Asteroids"" is what it sounds like, you just have asteroids that you're up against, however it is definitely just as tough as any of the other game modes.Easy, supposedly an “easier” arcade version of the game, quite honestly I can't tell; it's one hit and you're dead with all but one ship.Hard, supposedly a “harder” arcade version of the game, quite honestly I can't tell; it's one hit and you're dead with all but one ship.There  are also a number of ships you can unlock and play as, some move faster, some have bigger Particles dragging behind them, others have other advantages. All in all, there isn't much to say about the ships without giving away some of the few surprises within the game. In the end I found myself using only one or two of the different unlocked ships.Lastly, there's Local Co-op, I wish it was online multiplier, I have a tough enough time joining my steam friends in game (lining up my free time with someone else's) having a friend come over and play on the same machine as me... yeah no, that unfortunately will probably never happen.Achievements: There are 21 achievements on PARTICLE MACE... none of which are easily obtained. After my first play through I had a total of none of them (that's 5 hours of playing... with no achievements. Any other achiever would flinch after hearing that)There are four types of achievements in this game: Single Player, Co-op, Mastery and Grind. About 13 achievements are able to be earned on your own, 7 achievements earned in Co-op (Aye dn't haz N-E frnds, stahp mak'n meh mahke frnds), 1 achievement for doing everything, and out of those 21 achievements, at least half of those achievements require extensive grinding.Price: PARTICLE MACE is priced at $4.99 for 5 hours of entertainment out of the game. (so far, 08/03/15, I have a lot of grinding to do before I'm ready to give up.) All in all, that's a fair price. Even if you're tight on money, I always feel good about recommending indie games.Conclusion: I recommend PARTICLE MACE to gamers who enjoy playing older games, or are just looking for a change of pace. Unless you're an achievement hunter this game won't take very long to play through the missions and finish.			",141,13,3,13,8,0,23

												This is a great game. It is fun and works well with a mouse, but a controller is definitely recommended for singleplayer and required for multiplayer.

												It might seem like a misnomer, yet if Particle Mace shows anything, it's that it's possible to feel totally claustrophobic in space. Yes, notwithstanding being among the evidently unending degree that is the universe, you can feel swarmed, penned in, even pursued among the stars - well, while going up against Andy Wallace's high-score chaser, that is. Here's a preoccupation where, from the word go, you get yourself completely incorporated by comets tumbling towards your position and foe make brisk to track you down and take you out, without even a weapon to shoot in fear. Besides, for the underlying few tries at any rate, you're not at risk to survive said trap for more than a couple of minutes, either. Seen beginning from the top, Particle Mace's 2D thought on space is a round of survival, with a virtual thumbstick at the base of the screen your elite effect on strategies. Dealing with your ship around an encased piece of space, the fundamental way you can to shield yourself is to utilize the trails of refuse added to the back of your craft that the redirection urges you to use like a mace, swinging around to clear your surroundings. Anything your stopgap mace scopes is either annihilated (by virtue of enemy water crafts) or if nothing else diminished in size, with centers amassed along these lines. You then have a short window of time in which to build up a multiplier, with any additional boats you take out in progression passing on results of 10 centers when hung together. What makes Particle Mace especially fascinating is this separation between the redirection's setting and reality of its play. The preoccupation's instructional practice overemphasizes your disconnection: you're the last surviving pontoon in the universe, and you don't have anything to your name other than the fuel in your tank. Regardless, the insignificant method for the play space and the growing number of articles in your direction suggests that you're something other than alone – while your first instinct may be to keep up a vital separation from all your beforehand specified adversaries, really survival infers ducking and diving between said segments remembering the true objective to forgo them. Indeed, Particle Mace is a session of smoothness. When you build up a musicality, it quickly ends up being evident that you have to voyage particularly close to the contort in order to survive. A couple of foes, for instance, will fly around space in much an indistinct route from you, with their way especially easy to track. Others, regardless, are essentially more unconventional, shooting or pivoting space in impacts. Everything infers that being bashful will, after a hidden few butchers, achieve nothing for you, and to string together the kind of top scores required to open better ships for later entertainments, you have to fly straight up to your rivals and take them out just before they do similarly to you. It's the time when you start hanging together these multipliers that Atom Mace really finds its feet and play gets especially hurried, however if you support much all the more a test, the preoccupation's fundamental objective mode sees you have to open three achievements in one burst of play. Killing a set number of enemies in just a couple of minutes, or take out adversary especially all while endeavoring to hit distinctive destinations meanwhile gives Atom Mace's focal objective mode an extra edge and, in light of current circumstances, serves as an accommodating mentor for the major mode, giving you allow to do the kind of betrays you may shy a long way from in the essential mode, yet have the sureness to come back to in the wake of acing them going up against the preoccupation's missions. Also, furthermore an allow to have a touch of fun, and – with everything taken into account – Atom Mace shies a long way from putting fun in advance. It really doesn't have any kind of effect about the setting, nor does the setting of the waste trails you use to monitor yourself have a critical impact, either. What it is, that as it might, is put an absolutely one of a kind transform on what could have easily transformed into a standard, best down space shooter. Particle Mace, rather, feels absolutely new paying little heed to its retro stylings and passes on the kind of experience perfect for adaptable – eat measured bits of play faultless eatable in an additional couple of minutes, yet adequately content on offer for the people who support to some degree more than a snack, too. Space, then, may not be completely as diminish and unfilled as we want to think it is – it may actually be coordinating with life vivacious to take an interest in battle - yet if Atom Mace is anything to cruise by, it's little consider everyone on earth rushes to get up there. Putting another bend on the space shooter, Atom Mace is hurried to its inside, blaming you for fighting off gatherings of enemies without even a slug to fire with all due regard. Regardless, its disconnected mighty style isolates it from whatever is left of the class and the troubles stuffed inside guarantee it'll stay centered home screen for a long time to come.(All reviews are retrieved from the Internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time.

												       Particle mace is a game based on asteroids (from the 1970's) where you swing a mace around to break asteroids attack enemies and complete various tasks. It’s extremely basic but thats part of the appeal of retro arcade style games. here’s what makes it worth buying:       The soundtrack (by Nathanial chambers) is one of the best sound tracks for an arcade style game I have ever heard. It’s ambient and reminds me of tempest it can be turned off as well if you want to go full retro. They are selling the soundtrack alone for $1 and I would recomend getting it,The graphics are stylized it all looks very smooth and is reminiscent of vector graphics once again showing off it's conection to astroids.And the gameplay, It's very difficult, but not the kind that feels unfair. There are many gameplay modes to choose from including ""Arcade"",""Mission"" and ""Multiplayer arcade"". I recommend using a controller for this game. ",60,5,1,7,5,0,3

												PARTICLE MACE is a game that'll keep you entertained for maybe 30 minutes until you get fed up with it's flaws.The screen shakes and wobbles around every time you kill an enemy, which makes it extremely frustrating when you score multiple kills at once since you won't be able to see what you are doing and will most likely fly straight into an asteroid and get a game over.Another big flaw is the fact that at least in my case I have to disconnect every non-mouse/keyboard device from my PC in order to play it as the game will recognize anything else as a game controller which renders the game unplayable.On the positive side; the soundtrack in the game is nice, the graphics are simple but very cool and the gameplay is decent.I feel like the two very glaring faults I mentioned ruins the game for me, but since it's very cheap and it will at least keep you entertained for a little while I can't really fault it too much. I wouldn't recommend it personally but if you're a fan of arcade games, go for it.			",67,2,0,8,8,0,1

												I don't normally do reviews, so this is one of the few games that have a definite need for a good, truthful review.I honestly don't know how, nor do I want to, make a very long, and boring review... so I will keep it short, sweet, and simple.PARTICLE MACE is a very unique game, with absolutely beautiful gameplay, and style. The concept of the game is simple. Don't let your ship get hit by the meteors, ships, and other enemies around you, while staying inside your designated zone. Around you there are multiple ""particles"" attached to your ship. Your goal is to move around, and maneuver the particle so that they hit (and destroy) all of those nasty little meteors and what I can only assume are alien ships. The physics in the game are absolutely amazing as well, seeing as all of the particles pretty much revolve around them. Also, just so that the game does not begin to get boring early on, you have extra ships to unlock, with varying amounts of particles, and speed. Not only are there added ships, but there are also multiple missions that you are assigned or tasked with completing. This game is absolutely amazing, and most definitely worth those ten dollars!

												A simple, yet addicting asteroid type game. Pretty easy to pick up, very hard to quit. If you have a dual screen setup, I recommend using a screen lock program or else your mouse might cause your ship to move where you don't want it to go.Not dying is impossible, but it's fun to try.

												Destroy enemy ships and asteroids with bungee-tethered garbage. Particle Mace brings back Atari 2600 style gaming by combining minimalist graphics with intuitive gameplay. The game provides a handful of different game modes and challenges that keep it fun and engaging for much longer than I expected. Sometimes the simplest games can be the most enjoyable.

Early Access Review
								Bias: I did the sounds for this game (not the music), and I'm friends with Andy (the dev). While my clocked hours may not seem significant, trust me when I say I've played this game A LOT outside of steam.PARTICLE MACE is an arcade game that you can pick up and play in seconds. The only input is movement. That's it. You only press buttons in the menu. This makes for an easy to learn, difficult to master experience... gamer or not. It's great to play alone, and even better to play with friends.Part of why I love this game is how refined the movement is. PM doesn't try to be anything other than a rad arcade game. It doesn't stretch itself too thin, choosing instead to be a surgical strike of awesome. You want to top the charts on the high score list, or you want to destroy your friends by elegantly weaving through every obstacle and hitting that PERFECT swing of the mace into lesser players. You won't find branching dialogue, super crazy 3D graphics, or dozens of intricate maps. What you will find is an environment you think you've mastered, only to realize (either by high scores or deathmatch) that you aren't anywhere near as great as you thought you were. Killed by a stray asteroid? You failed. Dodge it next time. This is what PARTICLE MACE is. The ships all change the way you move / play in a meaningful and drastic way, which really made me eager to unlock and try them all. The music is amazing (again, friends with the composer), and the game is really nice to look at. The background is awesome to look at. While it can be played on damn near everything, I prefer the controller. If you live in the NYC area, track down the actual arcade cabinet for the best experience.			",165,34,1,8,14,3,14

												This is a fun little game.  The graphics aren't much to look at but it draws from one of the greatest arcade games of all time: Asteroids.  So imagine you're playing asteroids, except that instead of giving you a weapon that goes ""pew pew pew"" you get a bunch of small projectiles on some kind of leash that you can whip around your ship as you fly.  That's basically the ""Particle Mace"" from the title.So You're placed in a small area and these rather regularly sized asteroids come in around you.  They're not the main focus of the game though...they're more like extra obstacles.  The enemy ships ARE the main focus though.  They come in, darting at you, sweeping past you, flying all around.  You have to destroy these for big points, and for even bigger points you have to kill several in quick succession.   The way to a big score is not just killing enemies but combos.You do get points for destroying the asteroids as well but it's a mere fraction of the points you get for destroying the ships.  However, there are some asteroid only rounds to clear so don't think you can ignore them totally.  Also, there's mission mode where each round has some objectives to complete The mission mode seems to be a collection of objectives you have to achieve before you can go to the next level. e.g. don't hit any asteroids for 20 seconds, don't hit any ships for 20 seconds, kill x number of ships in a certain time limit, destroy x number of asteroids completely (because hitting them only splits them in two and halves their size until they get really small). I had some trouble getting this game to work with the steam controller.  In fact I scrounged through the forums to see if there was a fix and found out the developer didn't really work to make it steam controller compatible because it came out just before the steam controller was available. :(  Most disappointing.  You'd think the developer would have worked on steam controller compatibility afterward but I guess he's no longer working on it.So supposedly if you want to use the steam controller with this game, you have to totally clear all the Xbox controls out and make it work as a mouse and keyboard.  I don't know why it couldn't just work with a M&KB style config from the steam controller menu but that may be Valve's fault and not the developer.  I don't know.Things I liked about this game:  It's fun  controls are pretty simple  The objectives are pretty simple  It's still challenging though  It's a new twist on an old formula  There's multiple ships to earn, and you earn those by doing certain things in game.Things I didn't like:   It didn't want to work with the steam controller (I managed to get it working with an xbox controller)  Even with the xbox controller it didn't seem to respond to the menu very well.  In game it was fine though.  Some of the ships were less useful than others  Some of the ships are locked behind a ""mission mode"" game style.    Some of the missions in mission mode were kinda lameOverall though, the game is fun and I enjoyed it enough to play it for nearly an hour my first time out on it (which I usually don't do unless I'm really having fun).

Early Access Review
								Particle Mace has a bullet hell shooter vibe, but also has a much stronger feeling of flow / getting into a groove than shooters typically do. The game feels great and is very satisfying to play. The controls are polished and intuitive, the physics of the mace weapon are easy to learn, but there's clearly a high skill ceiling for tricks and techniques. Enemies, obstables, and level have simple and easy to read designs, very well done.In spite of how easy the game is to learn the missions (meta objectives) add a surpising amount of depth. For instance, some require you to limit movement or avoid killing things for a period of time. This challenges you to alter your style of play to complete a goal and think tactically rather than turn off your brain. I can't say how the game feels over a longer period time but the core mechanics are very well polished. You can pick this up and play it for just a few minutes and get quite a bit of enjoyment out of it. I feel like the psychological rewards in the core game loop are capable of making longer play sessions enjoyable too. I definitely recommended this if you like physics-based gameplay and/or bullet hell shooter types, and don't suffer from epilepsy.			",211,40,4,34,49,2,54

												This game is pretty cool for a casual arcade game.  The music is a pleasant techno arcade style that works well the gameplay.   Particle Mace is a new take on the classic Asteroids game.  Your Mace is a weapon that trails your ship and allows you to destroy asteroids and foes.    I recommend this game for anyone that enjoys a classic arcade remake.  It is also suitable for casual gamers as it's easy enough to enjoy without having to spend time learning the game for hours.			",171,17,9,6,24,2,25

Still, it is a very solid game reminiscent of Asteroids and Geomitry wars, and it has a missions mode that keeps it from getting too repetitive  due to giving you a bunch of mini challenges to work at. Really, even at full price you can do a LOT worse than this game. Highly recommended.			",182,23,1,7,8,0,12

												Geometry Wars MeleePlays best with a controller, but unfortunately the game will not accept a Steam controller.Your typical top-down twin-stick shooter, except that it's not typical because it's not a shooter and it only uses one stick. Move your ship around and use the inertia to swing your tetherballs at enemies and asteroids. Your own tetherballs can't hurt you, but contact with anything else will destroy your ship. The asteroids float around slowly like the asteroids in the game Asteroids. They also divide similarly. Enemies have different movement patterns, but they all come for you eventually.The arcade mode is fine: survive as long as you can and try for a high score (and by extension a couple achievements).I had a lot more fun playing through Mission Mode: There are 150 tasks for you to accomplish (things like ""beat 10 enemies"" or ""pass through the checkpoints without breaking any asteroids""), and you're assigned 3 at a time. The round ends either when you crash your ship or when all three active tasks have either been passed or failed. Successfully completing a task crosses it off the list, and when the round ends you're dealt a new one to replace it. For the most part, they're delivered to you in increasing difficulty. An early mission may challenge you to survive for 20 seconds in a limited radius, while a later mission may demand 60 seconds within the outer pull radius of a black holeI'm not sure if the 150 tasks are always delivered in the same order, but they make for some interesting combinations. Unfortunately, some of the combinations are infuriating. I had a round wherein I was expected to:Accumulate 300 points while limited to 1 tethered particleDestroy 10 enemies (Level layout: small cage, black hole)Completely break down a gigantic asteroid to its smallest componentAny two of those tasks would've been fine, but having all 3 active at the same time meant I was trapped in a fairly small level choked with gigantic asteroids all getting pulled toward a black hole faster than I could repeatedly break them down with my single particle. After dozens of failed attempts, I finally got an asteroid configuration that allowed me to carefully sneak around and pick off the 10 enemies, so that when I died, the next round wouldn't be the claustrophobic black hole stage.There are multiple ships to unlock, offering varying top speeds and particle options. You can change ships between each round of Mission mode, giving you an advantage against certain types of challenges.Glad I dug out a 360 controller to give this one another try.Showoff / 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fun little game and challenging as well. Good for any age as my 2, 6 and 11 year have had fun with it. Just wish they'd fix the xb360 wired controller using Steam link. Works fine at PC with controllers but over Steam link in game it acts as a cursor with no control over movement.			",124,20,3,5,9,1,4

												Great game. Maybe not worth the full price of $10, but that would just be because I could see it getting rather repetitive. Still, it is a very solid game reminiscent of Asteroids and Geomitry wars, and it has a missions mode that keeps it from getting too repetitive  due to giving you a bunch of mini challenges to work at. Really, even at full price you can do a LOT worse than this game. Highly recommended.			",182,23,1,7,8,0,12

												Disclaimer: I was generously given a free copy of Particle Mace with the understanding that I was expected to review the title after spending some time with it.        Particle Mace was a wonderful surprise; with a blend of asteroid/geometry wars aesthetic and Hammerfight combat, my first session was 3 or 4 hours of “just one more try”.        If you have never played Hammerfight, you’re not missing out on much but that is besides the point. The game controls just like every other twin stick shooter out there but instead of using the other stick to pick a direction to fire, you must master inertia to swing around a handful of tethered particles in order to strike down the enemies. There are several ship variants to unlock and each handle markedly differently but all feel wonderful and responsive to pilot. In addition, there are also many modifiers applied to the the tethers in the “Mission” mode to mix things up a bit.       On the subject of modes, there are 4 total of which I have only dabbled in two of them. I didn’t try out coop or deathmatch but I spent extensive time with the arcade (survival) and mission modes. The arcade has 3 endless difficulties-easy, hard and asteroid only-and they scale remarkably well as time passes and you begin to rack the points up. The mission mode constantly cycles through objectives and conditions to meet and is a blast to work through. Unfortunately, this can get rather frustrating because you may get assigned 3 very conflicting quests at once and they each can hinder the others from being completed. It would be really nice to be able to pass on a mission temporarily when it’s causing trouble. However, Particle Mace is still a blast to play despite this quirk as the Arcade mode provides more than enough challenge and replayability.        I was honestly not expecting much booting it up, but I’m so glad to have discovered this little gem.			",296,131,12,29,48,4,47

												ever swung a thing around your hand ? it's a simple thing to do, but the speed, the sound, the movement it makes always is strangely hypnotic and cool.  this game is just like that. one of the simplest, coolest thing. It also reminds you how fast the thing you swing around your hand violently ends up in someone else's face or window and ruin your day. But you just can't stop doing it. Maybe the game is lackin a ""real"" easy level, because even the first one gets hard quite fast, just to mess around with the physics and train, but other than that, it's a lesson in game design.

												This is a deceptively simple looking game. The mechanics are pretty straight forward: you have these tethers attached to the back of your ship which you must use to smash asteroids and kill foes (usually little red things that pursue you). It starts off fairly easy and gradually gets more difficult, the foes also seem to increase in complexity. It is such a relaxing and wonderful experience playing this game. You will probably find yourself replaying it over and over in a single setting to try and beat your/ friends high scores, or to do the 150 challenges. There is immense replayability here.I originally bought this to farm for trading cards but found myself unable to stop playing. I discovered you can unlock a large number of ships by accomplishing various objectives. All of the ships I have unlocked so far are all quite diverse and have their own pro's and con's (my favorite currently being the Catalyst). The soundtrack is also really lovely and relaxing.Do yourself a favour and grab this game, it's so cheap right now and you won't regret it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

SCore counter literallymakes the game jerk which is cute at first but gets tiresome.You wont get nearly as many hours out of it as yoiu might have thought as a resultso don't pay full price.

												An interesting spin on the classic game of Asteroids. Your ship has no weapons, but you are dragging a cluster of deadly particles behind your ship. Whirling them around like a mad man is how you defend yourself against the onslaught of deadly enemies and giant smashy space rocks.Play style is somewhere between casual and hardcore. The game can be played in Single Player or Local Co-Op mode.Local Co-Op supports up to 4 players, although you will need a controller for each player.Single Player mode consists of an Easy and Hard Endless mode, an Asteroids mode (no enemies) and 150 objectives in Mission mode. Also includes Leaderboard, Steam Achivements and Trading Cards.The game is very easy to pick up and play but challenging to master. It has Controller support for both Xbox and PlayStation game pads, which I highly recommend over using the keyboard.Lastly it has a pretty awesome music score. Or you can just listen to a loop of ""Particle Man"" by ""They Might Be Giants"" as you play.			",1292,780,77,215,160,8,139

												Eyo! This is my first review, but I'll try to be as informative as I can to try and help you make your decision of either to buy or not buy this game. :DTo buy or not to buy... that is the question.FYI: I'm writing this only after having the game for one day... I actually just purchased it today.Pros/Cons:Pros:-Cheap!-Not a shooting game! (not sure if that's considered a pro, but just letting you know)-The pro above this one rhymed-Addicting-150 missions-Arcade-style (which I'm guessing you must like if you're even considering this game. :P)-Many different unlockable ships with their own unique traits, try to collect 'em all!Cons:-Not really a multiplayer game (you can play in multiplayer but then you'd all have to be sitting in front of the same computer, and don't quote me on this but I'm 99% sure multiplayer requires a controller)-No way to get rid of the border around the area where you're allowed to travel, meaning that you are always stuck in that little space.  There's no option for an unlimited world, so you are always stuck within the restraints of that border.  Just something that bugs me a little.  Just a little.-The soundtrack isn't included with the game.  You have to purchase it separately.  This is my first time encountering this so I'm not sure if it's common practice, but something I didn't like.-Graphics are well... arcade-like.  But it's an arcade style game, so...----------Overview----------You're a small, tiny ship stuck in the middle of space.  You have no weapons except some orange trash particles attached by strings to your ship.  You must maneuver your ship around to get the trash particles to hit the asteroids and other enemies.  Your enemies are the red shapes, which, unlike the asteroids, will actually aim for you.  In mission mode, you can try and complete various challenges.  In arcade mode, there are no preset challenges, so you just try to top your previous high score.  There are 3 different difficulties, 4 if you count tutorial mode: Easy, Hard, and Asteroid.  Easy and hard are pretty self-explanatory, while asteroids has no enemies in it, only asteroids.  There's also 2 different multiplayer modes, but I can't say much for those because I'm unable to play them due to a lack of controllers.  Overall, I would definitely reccomend this game to anyone with time to spare and prefers a strategy, arcade style game over a violent shooting game.  If what you've been reading sounds like your cup of tea, then I'd definitely reccomend you pick this game up.  It's worth the money, although I did get mine for 53 cents as it is on a 92% discount as of this moment (39 cents for the game, 14 cents for the soundtrack).Thanks for reading my first ever game review! :D Hope I helped you with your decision.  If you have any questions, just let me know.-CommanderClasherOh, almost forgot to mention- the narrator (not really a narrator because they talk using text, but I digress) isn't your typical boring narrator.  I was very entertained by their ""well, you're screwed"" type of attitude.			",4,1,0,1,2,0,1

												Particle Mace is a small, tight, fun little game. It's a twin-stick-shooter, except you only use one stick, if that makes any sense. Instead of directional fire from the second stick, you drag ""particles"" behind you on stretchy tethers (i.e. a ""mace), and use the physics model to whip your mace into enemies. It's a neat mechanic that forces the player to split their focus between dodging enemies and asteroids, and fudgily manipulating the mace to make kills. The physics model is simple but perfect, and never feels arbitrary or mean. There's a classic score-chase mode, and a ""mission"" mode, which gives the player a selection of interesting goals to meet, which provides a neat way to switch up the gameplay and keep it fresh. There's multiple ships to unlock, which provide further tweaks to how the game plays. It's not going to be your game of the year, but Particle Mace might be your ""interesting diversion of the year that you boot up for five or ten minutes every week"".			",355,104,13,56,54,3,88

												A very interesting take on the classic arcade game asteroids. There is an amazing ammount of depth and strategy to this game which was quite surprising to me. The art style is done in a minimalist fashion which very much works to the games advantage. The whole notion of having to drag your projectiles behind you is absolutely genius!-The Editor ",441,81,8,44,37,4,51

												Particle Mace is a fun little arcade game with satisfying gameplay like many classic 90's arcade games. The game has ships that are unlockable through completeting challenges that get more difficult as you progress which I think is a nice unlock system because new ships have different playstyles. Overall If you're a person who enjoys a good challenge I would recommend trying this game out.			",46,10,1,5,3,0,5

												Particle Mace is a small, tight, fun little game. It's a twin-stick-shooter, except you only use one stick, if that makes any sense. Instead of directional fire from the second stick, you drag ""particles"" behind you on stretchy tethers (i.e. a ""mace), and use the physics model to whip your mace into enemies. It's a neat mechanic that forces the player to split their focus between dodging enemies and asteroids, and fudgily manipulating the mace to make kills. The physics model is simple but perfect, and never feels arbitrary or mean. There's a classic score-chase mode, and a ""mission"" mode, which gives the player a selection of interesting goals to meet, which provides a neat way to switch up the gameplay and keep it fresh. There's multiple ships to unlock, which provide further tweaks to how the game plays. It's not going to be your game of the year, but Particle Mace might be your ""interesting diversion of the year that you boot up for five or ten minutes every week"".			",355,104,13,56,54,3,88

The gameplay is unique and enjoyable whilst the game presents itself with aesthetically appealing art and a simplistic UI.  Pros: Fun, unique gameplay.Good game for killing time.Visually pleasing. Cons: Frankly, the game is too expensive for what it offers.You should only buy this game if it's on sale. All in all, a fun game for the minute sale price going as low as $0.19 USD.

It's such a simple concept, with the pixelly graphics, and fun, challenging and creative gameplay style. Literally, I am addicted to this game. Oh, and it has full controller support. And local multiplayer. I dont know if online multiplayer is a thing. Oh, and you can locally 1v1 your bros using the deathmatch thing. 10/10 Would crash pixelly spaceship into huge unavoidable asteroid again.			",23,5,0,5,6,0,1

												I had 24 games, and since this game as 98% off for 19 cents, I figured I would get it just to get my 25 games owned badge.When I bought it, I decided to try it out, despite the fact that when watching the trailer it did not seem like my type of game at all. However, after playing it for about 15 minutes, I can already tell this can be a good time-waster, and it has an addiction factor to it as well. Whether it is beating all the missions or breaking your own personal high score, you just naturally hit replay.Since the game is currently only 19 cents, I would recommend gifting it to a friend or persuading a friend to buy it so you can play each other in the multiplayer.In all, this game is definitely worth the 19 cents it is currently at, but I would not buy it for it's full price of $9.99 (even though I think this game is better than both Dead Effect and Orion: Prelude which for some reason I have)			",117,18,3,5,9,2,6

												The most well-made casual game i've ever played. It has more features than I expected, so here is the good stuff:- Simple but amusing graphics.

Enemies after you all the time and lots of asteroids to dodge.- Unlockable spaceships with different shapes, particles (weapon) and movement.- Mission mode with 150 tasks to be completed in certain conditions. This one is highly addictive, be carefull.- A local multiplayer mode wich seems awesome (i didn't try). you'll need controllers for this one.- Casual funny language.- Cheap! wait a bit for a 90% sale, sell some cards and get it for a few cents.

												Awesome, polished game. I bought this when it was on sale, thinking that it might be fun for a couple hours. After finally firing it up and playing with a buddy for a 20 minutes or so, we were both hooked, The use of maces as weapons really adds to the challenge of the game, requiring you to maneuver your ship in such a way that you avoid asteroids while keeping your mace's momentum. Swinging your mace perfectly to hit an enemy is one of the most satisfying things I've done in a game. The versus mode is also quite intense.			",30,8,0,4,5,0,3

												Wow I can't believe that this game is regularly $9.99. I bought it for $.19..That's .19 CENTS..on sale, so wait for the sale if you want this. It's a fun game though, and works great with an xbox 360 controller, but for some reason it doesn't want to work with the Steam Link and Steam controller on my TV. I think it has something to do with the two seperate application boxes that pop up when you start the game. If this goes on sale again just buy it. You could easily spend many hours on this game flying the little ship, and flinging the mace thing around.			",142,25,3,47,22,1,26

												TLDR; Get it on sale if your unsure, but, it is worthwhile to buy if you enjoy retro games.This is one of those ""retro"" games, it reminds me of Super Stardust with a few quirks. One of those quirks is you don't have a traditional weapon. Instead you swing what could be described as a mace directed partially by your ship's movement. Another quirk is that the game tends towards mission based combat, as well as including the more traditional ""open"" endless fighting. Finally, this last quirk gives you something to look forward to; as your skill improves, you will be able to unlock additional ship styles, which ultimately give you some much needed variation to your strategies. I do still play from time to time, but this game to for me, is not the type I can just sit and play constantly.			",62,20,0,17,9,0,16

												Really fun pick-it-up-and-put-it-down game when you've got 15 minutes or so.The music and graphics are quickly engaging but it's the unique gameplay that will keep you engaged. Becoming comfortable with the let-me-swing-this-around-my-head game mechanic is not something I'd encountered before: should you focus on keeping the momentum going in a circle to increase the power of your Particle Mace? or is a back-and-forth motion a better strategy for clearing out the area immediately surrounding you?The many challenges will keep you coming back for more (at least it has for me).Note: something changed (not sure what it was) that reset at least some of the progress and stats on this game; my review is based only on the gameplay as it was created by the developer.

												This game is actually pretty good, the 8-Bit music might get annoying, since its a one loud loop.I discovered this game when I was crafting the bagde and a cool background dropped from it.PS: I have only played the missions and not the whole game, so there might be a different songs too, dunno.

												I'd like to recommend this game, it's got a lot of potential, but the lack of keyboard support makes this utterly unplayable without a controller. I get that 8 way keyboard movement wouldn't be as smooth as an analog stick, but don't force people to use a mouse, especially when you don't constrain the mouse movement in any way. Far too often my mouse wanders off onto the other screen and I find myself unable to move in any direction that isn't left.			",193,65,7,28,39,5,67

												The story, so mindblowing.You are a being inside a ship whos great abilities bring great change. Sadly, due to your uncontrollable power you are swinging your powers everywhere, killing many innocents who get caught in the deathwaves of your power. Due to your slaughtering of the innocent, many vigilantes now come after you, feeling fear you unrelentless wave your powers at them killing them by the thousands.You open your eyes and see what you have done....you have started an endless cycle of killing...shapes...geometrical figures..lying dead....because of your power. Now you seek to change the world with this, people you loved decimated because of your power, choices to be made decide where you end up a shape, or a figure of pure geometric purpose.11/10 Best plot 2015.

												The game has its charm:Very intersting soundtrack - dynamic, but not interruptive. Perfect for the pace of the game.Interesting weapon: Imagine demolition of buildings with mace attached to a plane. That kinda describes the gameplay.It is not that kind of game where enemies sidescrolling with speed of light to test your patience. This is good combination of abstract visuals with physical dynamic of The Weapon(named 'Particle Mace') which makes it into unique tactical arcade game where challenge is proportional to how dangerously you plan to play it. Due to unique weapon it is possible to discover different tactics on how to manipulate it effectively, especially considering different unlockable 'ships' with their own down- and upsides with special abilities.Missions mode deserves its own prize: you are granted with 3 tasks each round. When you complete them all you get a new set, but if you die new ones will replace the completed ones leaving the unfinished tasks to the next round and as some modify the enviroment(like do A in a black hole or smash 50 asteroids in asteroid field) the old one can become a challenge(Hiker(reach spots without hurting asteroids) mission along with asteroid field or yellow space) which opens new tactical opportunities on to how approach them to make problematic tasks easier by shifting others. Priorities matter!The only downside I have managed to discover is absence of network multiplayer.			",136,47,1,19,50,0,21

												Well, I bought this game for approximately nothing, but it was worth a tenfold more. It's similar to titles such as Grid Wars and Geometry wars – contrary to those titles, however, it requires not only precise use of the mouse to navigate through hostile space, but also understanding of the ships' and enemies' behavior. The game offers a very smooth gameplay (its CPU usage is relatively low). It has a very nice, well-fitting, ambient soundtrack. The backstory is gripping. And last but not least – it can notably pride itself in having the best controller remapping in the history of gaming.It does have a number of drawbacks, though – namely:• a console window is shown when the game is starting;• you cannot change variables governing the game's behavior (at least not in-game);• Alt + F4 does not work.Still, it is a fun game to spend some evenings with!

												This game is very wonderful. It may be not the most graphically impressive game, or the most complicated game ever. But it is fun. It is very fun. In this game you're a ship with a mace behind you, and you use that mace to kill the other ships trying to ram into you, but on top of that you have to worry about crashing into asteroids, because you're constantly surrounded by them. On top of this their is also missions which are small objectives you complete to progress onward, but while you complete the missions, the level has a slight twist to it like it's been generated with a few things thrown in. You'll have missions where you won't get to kill anything for 25 seconds, missions where you must go to the marked locations, missions where you must smash asteroids at a fast rate. What I'm saying basically is that it's a fun little game that constantly throws new♥♥♥♥♥♥at you. Like Nintendo did when they made Mario 3. Do I recommend it. Yes, for 5$ it's not a waste at all. It's a good time waster and man it feels like time dilates for a bit. I beat 21 missions and unlocked a  new ship on hard difficulty. That took 20 minutes. Their are 150 missions in total so it definitely has enough content to give you a great experience for a few hours.My rating=10/10(More people should help this game sale).			",411,91,9,66,43,5,49

												An interesting take on the Asteroids type shooter, your concentration is a little more spread out as it's not a simple matter of aiming the nose of your ship and firing, but having to use velocity to swing your particles around.Challenging, different, and for less than a buck, well worth getting if you're into overhead spaceship shooters like Asteroids, Geometry Wars or Beat Hazard with a bit of a twist.

												First 2 hours and my review was super-positive, I like what the game does and how it does it BUTThere are some issues and the developer hasn't bothered in read the forums or respond to emails so I have to assume they're issues which aren't going-away anytime soon...Mission Mode is a lovely idea, however missions can come in combos which are VERY hard to beat (more luck than skill) and 1 or 2 combos are plain impossible.  If you get such a combo, your only option is to either play the game until you get lucky or hack the mission XML file to change the missions you're playing - neither is what I'd expect to do to complete a game.Everytime you kill an enemy the game pauses/shakes the screen.  This is fine when there are a few enemies, but when there are lots the game becomes a stutterfest and it's almost impossible to control your ship/avoid hitting stuff.  Whether a controller works or not seems random - restarting sometimes fixes it.  A controller is advisable here - being able to sneak or dash is key to completing missions - so it's a pain having to restart the game a few times to make it work.Some achievements seem reluctant to unlock - most are REALLY hard so it's even more demoralising when they fail to trigger.As I said earlier, it's a fun concept but it needs a BIT of polishing/some bugfixes and - well - doesn't seem like the developer plans to do any			",606,162,56,93,89,4,107

												imagine asteroid, except instead of that lame gun your ship has a half dozen flails bound to it by gravitational rubber bands.that's pretty much particle mace.  If you don't like flying around in a 2d space game dodging asteroids, then you won't like this, but I thought it was pretty dang good.Pro:it has 150 missions, which you have 3 of at a time, meaning that you're never just doing the same thing repeatedly.Con:sometimes the quests interact in weird ways that make completing any of them very hard.  for example I had one quest that multiplied spawns of enemies by 4 or 5, with a goal to kill 50 enemies.  Then I got a quest that turned all enemy spawns into the strongest enemy in the game with a goal of ""survive for 40 seconds"".  suddenly I had bazillions of the strongest enemy in the game on me and it was kinda painful.  This could be considered a pro, since it adds more variability, but some of that variablity is *hard*Pro:It knows how much gameplay it has, and doesn't try to make you stay too long for the sake of ""game length""con: that being said it's still pretty shortPro: the sounds are funfor the price I don't regret anything, and enjoyed this while it lasted			",408,175,0,179,43,5,125

tl;dr: I wholeheartedly recommend Particle Mace to players who enjoy the idea of goal-oriented destruction and non-destruction (depending upon the goal) of asteroids and various types of UFOs using varying numbers of particles TETHERED to your ship using lines of varying lengths and attributes.I've played only the single-player mode of Particle Mace, but with 1-3 friends this could be even more fun! (local multiplayer, competitive and coop, as listed in the About This Game section on the Store page. I wonder why 1-player coop is given as an option? That's basically what single-player mode is, I suppose.)Details: You start with an 'average' ship. There are nine other ships that can be unlocked upon on reaching specific goals in the game. Another ship, for example, can take one extra hit before being destroyed (making two in all) but it moves more slowly and its ""particles"" are therefore closer to the ship and easier for me to control, based upon the number of goals I've completed using that ship when compared to the others I've unlocked. (A very nifty statistics screen lists many statistics, such as the number of goals completed, which ships you've used and how many times, the amount of points and damage done with each ship type, etc., which is where I learned what I've just stated about my better success with the slower ship. One of the ships is very fast but the particle tethers connected to your ship are much longer and more difficult to control with precision. You play in an arena, which is typically a moving, rotating polygon. Asteroids and baddies move around without regard for the polygon, but contacting it with your ship will destroy your ship. In some of the timed goals, the polygon might be huge and you might only be able to reach the objective while dodging asteroids and baddies if you're flying a fast ship. Sometimes, the polygon is shaped like a cloverleaf or is a rectangle in which your ship is confined. Because three goals are active at a time, sometimes they conflict, for better or for worse. For example, in order to complete a ""pass through all the points marked around the arena in 30 seconds"" you'll have to disregard—for now—an also-active ""stay within the marked boundary without killing anything for ## seconds"". Or, you might have a goal which requires you to eliminate a large number of asteroids and another goal which requires that you reach a specific point value using only two particles. That will mean you have only two particles as long as the two-particle goal is present in the list. Each time you fail a goal it will be unattainable until the next mission you warp into. If you complete all of your goals your ship will warp out and you'll have three new objectives for the next mission. Any goal you complete is crossed out and will be replaced with a different goal for the next mission. The variety in goals combined with having multiple goals active simultaneously adds a great deal to both the enjoyment and the replayability of Particle Mace! A colorblind accessibility mode is present in the game for those who have difficulty with color perception.Particle Mace is, in my opinion, worth it![outdated product pricing information removed. If you didn't find my review helpful, that's your opinion, but it is more comprehensive than a lot of reviews.]			",1204,355,26,97,84,10,117

												Totally broken device detection. I can't play this game at all because it thinks I have a controller connected, and I don't. I tried unplugging everything. There are similar complaints in the discussion boards, and the devs have not done anything about it. I will update if this is ever resolved.Edit: It turns out that this was a conflict with the SCP DS3 drivers. I'm keeping the negative review because no other game has this issue, and the only solution was to uninstall SCP.			",103,23,1,3,11,1,5

												              So far I've only played single player for this game.A very distinct and creative title. To me it seemed like an updated version of Astroids. You destroy rocks and enemies through the use of a destructive tether (the mace). The tether responds to any small movement you make. Find enough room to fly your ""ship"" in a cricle, and it'll cause the tether to gain speed and momentum; this makes for an efficient destructive force that any astroid and red triangle would tremble by. There are 150 Missions ranging from pure point accumuluation to not destroying anything at all within a certain amount of time. It sounds and looks easier than it is. The hectic nature of the game means random chance is a bigger factor than skill. Certain moments cause needless difficulty such as a the camera shaking after a nice chain of kills.               There are several ""ships"" each with its own unique movement and weight. Heavier ships are slower and may hold larger particles on its tether. There are no levels, the game area changes after completing missions. You have 3 missions to complete at any one time. One area might be designed for one of those missions, but you can still complete the others in the same area. This also causes difficulty, as you might end up with a mission that was meant for an easier area, but since you've progressed past it, you'll just have to somehow finish it in a more diffcult settings. Finally; great soundtrack that works well with the visuals.             The suggested retail is $5.00. I purchased this on sale, I personally would not get it at the full price, but I'm tight with my cash. It may be be worth it to some if you're in the market for this sort of game. It is only 5 bucks!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game itself is fantastic! It's a minimal, clean take on the twin-stick shooter. Word is you can go buy a proper working version over at itch.io, direct from the developer!The Steam release is a bloody mess. Apparently the developer of the game is not in control of the Steam release. The Steam publisher keeps wrapping the game in a new piece of adware each month, wiping out your save. Do not buy this game on Steam.Well, unless you don't like saving your progress or have any reasonable expectation to not be purchasing ads. If that's the case, then sure, buy this Particle Mace: Steam Garbage Edition.			",516,145,24,80,42,6,73

												Review of the singleplayer campaign (not interested in multiplayer):I have to say, I am honestly surprised. In a good way. The Black Ops 3 campaign is way longer than what we are used to in this franchise. I think it took me about 12 hours, which is a good length for a shooter, even by normal standards - but especially compared to other Call of Duty games.The story was pretty boring in the beginning. But it got better and better, to the point where I was honestly interested in how it all would play out. The acting was pretty good (real actors, digitalized). And the ending - well, the ending was great. It left me sitting in front of my monitor and wondering what the hell just happened. I ended up reading explanations and theories about the story for another 20 minutes. It is a surprisingly complex story for this kind of action game. Not quite on the same level as Bioshock Infinite or To the Moon, but way above your usual CoD story. I have to say, I really liked it (despite the boring start).The gameplay is CoD standard. Nothing special here. You have some abilities to unlock and upgrade. But I rarely used them. You have a wall-run, but only a few opportunities to use it in the levels. It felt unnecessary. And that was a shame, because it's a cool mechanic and should have been integrated better in the level design. Most of your enemies are the typical noname soldiers. There are also certain types of mechs. Some are soldier-like, and a few bigger ones, which require the use of a rocket launcher. So there is some variety here, but in the end it is typical CoD shooter gameplay. Which is not brilliant, but alright.The graphics are ok. The game looks quite good sometimes, but overall dated. They really make the most out of the old engine. But the game cannot compete with modern titles like Battlefront or Witcher 3.If you want a number - I guess I would give it a 7.5/10 for the campaign. And it could have been more, had they improved the gameplay a little more. I really didn't think it would be that good. ",87,3,0,5,7,3,4

												A novel idea destroyed by its execution. The premise of using ""physics""  in this manner instead of just being another shooter is intriguing but the controls and some design choices destroy what reliable fun you could have here. Largely the game plays how it looks in the steam video. However, the controls are simply a touch too sloppy and sluggish. Considering that you need to be nimble and fast in order to survive and reliably attack with your trailing balls makes it critical to have perfect controls.Barring that, which can be ignored once you get used to it, there is one super, super annoying aspect and that's the screenshake after killing an enemy. It's like a stutter zoom and it's stupid and I hate it. *kicks dirt* It adds nothing and if it's meant to add a sense of chaos or whatever, there are better ways to do that. I paid 20 cents for this and really...still not worth it. My time is better spent elsewhere in my backlog.			",745,134,23,93,104,10,118

												Someone's Introduction to Game Programming 101 summer project got released on Steam. This is a ripoff of 1962's Spacewar, but with colour.   It still relies mostly on line graphics, but with a few rasters thrown in.   Basically, terrible graphics.   No options to change resolution, etc etc make this game completely fail on technical grounds.Gameplay wise, an attempt is made to differentiate from Spacewar by removing the players weapon and adding a series of orange dots which you drag around with you and try to smash into your enemies (hence, particle mace), which is pretty woeful premise for a game considering that's all the developer had.On top of all this the developer is having a little joke and asking for people to pay him money for this rubbish.

It swings too slow, only goes through you when it's moving fast, doesn't hit enemies unless it's going fast, and stays in front of you if you fly slow. You can't line up shots without spending 10 times as long as should be needed to reposition yourself (due to the bad weapon physics).4. Wasn't fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a beautiful example of an indie game that shows creativity and what games should do more of. I highly enjoy this game, it's a physics game that is also an arcade game. It's quite relaxing and fun to play. You move around with your mouse and control a ship, with the ship is attached some particles, they can either be big or small depending on your gameplay style aka which ship you choose. You can unlock ships by getting high scores in easy, hard, Asteroid mode or mission mode. All of which are fun.I will keep playing this game as I've beenr eally enjoying it so far. I highly recommend this game if you like arcade games or indie games. Support this developer for more games like this.			",80,16,3,10,7,0,5

												Really fun original take on the asteroids formula. Instead of just shooting asteroids this time your ship can't shoot but has ""particle maces"" trailing behind it attached with strings that move according to physics. The challenge is to manuever the ship to hit all the obstacles with the maces while still dodging them. Hard but satisfying. Also good soundtrack.			",638,168,18,57,56,10,122

												8.5 / 10This game is pretty sweet! I highly recommend you stop reading this now, install & give it a whirl!This is a top-down space-shooter inspired by classics like ""Asteroids"" with a unique twist where you swing a trailing mace behind your ship killing enemies, smashing asteroids while simultaneously dodging lethal collisions - a simple formula made rather techincal by your skills @ manipulating the physics-based reactions of your mace. Good sound track, unique enemies, multi-kill points multiplier, unique ship unlocks, evolving environment, various game modes & missions, co-op arcade & deathmatch. The controls are snappy & responsive with the mouse. Nice effects with one minor caveat being it can sometimes be hard to keep track of your ship after exploding enemies. Drawing cricles with my mouse has never been such fun! Great wee indie gem.			",454,99,14,53,45,4,98

												This game takes seconds to learn is quite a bit of fun but there's too much camera shake effect. The shaking is unnecessary and tough on the eyes and it makes it impossible to control the ships because you have no idea where the asteroids, the borders and your ship are while its shaking violently. There are quite a few different types of ships but most of them are worthless or have worthless features like all the mace parts clumping together at speeds necessary to keep them circling or drifing off to one side from some invisible wind and not having any snap when you need it. The missions are pretty clever and will keep you entertained for 6 hours or so but after that I think Particle Mace has limited appeal as too much depends on luck. Definitely worth a few bucks though and no regrets that I bought it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When I was younger, I had a lot of fun playing Asteroid for the Atari 2600, now comes along this game. It's a very similar concept and graphical style, but this game adds so much compared to what the Atari, and arcade version had available (even though there were many limitations then). The only difference is, instead of a weapon, you get a mace made out of particles!There's the arcade mode, which is basically score attack, and is very fun. There's missions, which is by far my favorite. Very challenging, fun, quick, missions that have specific requirements. There's other co-op modes, but I don't have any friends available at the time of writing this review to try it out with, nor do I have a second gamepad.If you like quick, simple, interesting gameplay this is a great game for you.

												This is a really interesting take on the space shooter game (e.g. geometry/grid wars), but not without its flaws:- half the time the game crashes before it even gets to the main menu- when it does get to the main menu, it often fails to detect the gamepad (or better: it detects it, it just doesn't work)- as other reviewers have pointed out, you are somewhat ""punished"" by killing foes: between the resulting overlays and screen flashes it is rather easy to lose sense of your surroundingsI'd recommend the game, but not at full price.

												The first time I played Particle Mace was at a PAX party last year, and I was fairly drunk.  When the social anxiety started to kick in, I grabbed another drink and shuffled over to where they had a few indie games set up to project against the walls, thinking that if I looked like I was engrossed in watching others play, no one would bother me.  People seemed most excited about a game that looked like some sort of colorful modern Astroids, except they were sling-shotting particles around and fighting with four players in a battle royale.  I don't really recall everything that happened that night, but at some point I had a controller in my hands and was playing Particle Mace against three others.  It was one of the most intense and fun gaming experiences I've ever had, and I somehow managed to outmanouver everyone and claim victory.Yes this game is beautiful and silky-smooth fluid, but most of all it's SATISFYING.  Every time your particles smash into an astroid, enemy, or player, the game emphasises it in a way that scratches an itch I didn't know I had.A++ would recommend especially as a (drunk) couch co-op game.

I played it probably a solid 20 hours offline plus whatever amount it says online.Also, the challenges where you AREN'T supposed to kill/destroy stuff or the ones where you have to race are a ♥♥♥♥♥.10/10 Would break controller again over a wrecking ball racecar.

Speaking of stars, they're the nastist little buggers in the game for peaceful challenges.Multiplayer content is somewhat boring 7/10 still a nice couch experience			",146,36,4,33,21,3,46

												Bought it for 0,19 bucks. It's funny to say that it's worth every penny but seriously..it's a bit like agar.io which I hated. What do you do? You play an arrow with some balls attached and your ""objective"" is to destroy as much as possible with movement and not do die/touch enemies.  Is it fun? Totally! Addicting? You bet! Worth 10 bucks? Not too sure. This game is really well made but also simplistic. You can get several AAA games for 10 bucks or less. This one is very addicting though, unlike a lot of AAA games. It's really good, it's your personal preference if it's worth to you. (3x it's).			",787,255,33,85,79,10,118

												When I was younger, I had a lot of fun playing Asteroid for the Atari 2600, now comes along this game. It's a very similar concept and graphical style, but this game adds so much compared to what the Atari, and arcade version had available (even though there were many limitations then). The only difference is, instead of a weapon, you get a mace made out of particles!There's the arcade mode, which is basically score attack, and is very fun. There's missions, which is by far my favorite. Very challenging, fun, quick, missions that have specific requirements. There's other co-op modes, but I don't have any friends available at the time of writing this review to try it out with, nor do I have a second gamepad.If you like quick, simple, interesting gameplay this is a great game for you.

												Very fun. The concept of the game is simple, you fly around dragging a bunch of weights that are smashed into enemies while trying not to crash into obstacles. It reminds me of Hammerfight quite a bit, with a dash geometry wars thrown in. It's incredibly satisfying to control, especially when you accomplish something tricky. There are a number of different ships with their own quirks and features, I really enjoyed the differences they each provided, especially in the multiplayer versus. They're not really balanced, but that hardly matters when you're playing by yourself or with friends.No online, but local multiplayer is pretty solid if you've got people around and multiple gamepads. There aren't very many maps, but they're dynamic and faily distinct. The game also slowed down quite a bit in multiplayer as players moved apart and the game had to zoom out. This was on my laptop however, which is nothing close to a powerhouse, but still suggests some optimization issues.I don't think I'd recommend the game without a controller, I just can't imagine fluidly controlling the ships without one. Fortunately, it's been friendly with all types that I've tried (360 and logitech).If nothing else, it's great arcade time waster.			",511,96,4,45,16,3,35

												This is the type of game where I wish there was a mixed-feeling button. I played more on another account too, so altogether I have 5 hours at the tiñe of writing this.Pros:-Intuitive controls-Good music-Original design and gameplay styleMixed:-Fun gameplay for the days where you don't know what to play, but somewhat repetitive after some timeCons:-The missions are normally unfair, colliding with each other (aka ""kill x enemies in a short period of time"" and ""survive with only two pellets for x time"", etc...)-30 FPS lock?-Achivement bugs from what I've experiencedKeep in mind I couldn't test the multiplayer. In conclusion, I would get this game when it's on sale (I think it's less than a dollar then?), due to the problems above. I rate it 6/10.			",19,1,5,1,2,0,3

												Though similar to twin stick shooters such as Geometry Wars, it's the execution that makes this game different. First off you have no shooting style weapon, instead you have a set of particles strapped to your ship. By using momentum to spin or flick the particles, you use them to destroy the asteroids and enemies that come your way. It's a simple concept in premise, but the game itself is challenging. Between the different enemy types, asteroids that break apart as you hit them, and the ever changing arena, there are lots of ways to fail. Multiple unlockable ships vary the game, where each ship has different abilities and different particles. Also different game modes offer different styles of play. The simple graphics feel like the game was made in the 80's, with a obviously modern physics engine. The music is very synth and gives a great energy to the game. This is a great pick up and play game when you just have some time to kill, but offers enough depth to keep coming back again and again.			",165,70,6,30,20,3,21

												This game is surprisingly great. It can serve as a casual occupy-myself-for-five-minutes, or you could spend an hour intensely focused on completing missions, unlocking ships, or maintaining a combo for as long as possible. The multiplayer doubles, nay triples the lifespan of the game. The controls are tight and fluent, the physics works how you would expect it to, you can play the game on a toaster, and I have nothing to complain about.Actually, I have one minor complaint. The volume should be controlled by a slider, rather than just mute/unmute. Nothing that ruins the experience, but would be helpful. At least the music is excellent.			",126,27,0,14,12,0,6

												An excellent example of the exploration of pure gameplay mechanics, like the child of Geometry Wars and Hammerfight.  You control a ship tugging a constellation of 'trash particles' that you swing around like a mace (morningstar actually).  It's got a good skill curve and challenge-based progression system that will keep you engaged for a very long time.

												A pretty harsh arcade game. You are left to 150 different challenges that you complete in no particular order which unlocks the worst ship in the game. 10/10 would bang. On the realistc side of things you'll get a decent bit of playtime. Wether you enjoy that time or not is completely dependant on your determination and tolerance.

												Super Hexagon 2: Revelations finally comes to Steam again and this time, it's personal.You play as Commander Shephard in a fight to save humanity from geometry with rocks on strings.  You face off in the ultimate arena known only as ""arcade.""  This game is different from most games on the market because your decisions actually mean something, just like the original Super Hexagon (no TellTale here!).  For instance, the ""score"" in the bottom left corner isn't a score at all; it shows how many humans the combine will keep alive to enslave when they take over Pandora (the higher number the better btw).The story is very complex.  There's tons of sexual tension between the rocks and a triangle, and you, the player, can decide where to put it.  Will you release the tension by having alien sex like in Star Effect, or will you build it up to become stronger like in 1984 by George Orwell.  Like I said, your decisions really affect the story, and the better decisions you make the more story you get.  But of course, the best decision you can make is to get this game.9.8/10 ""good game""			",202,45,3,27,25,0,14

												Ok, I just have to say this game is straight up the best games I have played this season. Reason? The missions are very creative, and it allows you to experience the different types of scenario of what the game decides to give you. The CO-OP/Deathmatch are the most fun to play with your friends, hell, as hard as the game seems when you play it on the big screen, it's very entertaining to watch everyone work together. The game supports controllers, which is pretty cool imo (but tbh, it's easier than using the mouse, however it's just preference on what your game style may be when it comes to this game) Thank goodness it was a dollar, get it while you can before it's back to ten.

I expect multi-player is even better.There is not much to say to describe the mechanics that isn't already conveyed by the video, but I should say that the availability of several ships and game modes ensure that this game isn't as monotonous as some of the classics it is inspired from.Ah, the “System requirements” section for the Mac on the store page is a bit laconic so I will complete that: this game plays perfectly on a 2006 Mac Pro running OS X 10.7 (Lion) using a GeForce 7300 GT as video card.

It's quite relaxing and fun to play. You move around with your mouse and control a ship, with the ship is attached some particles, they can either be big or small depending on your gameplay style aka which ship you choose. You can unlock ships by getting high scores in easy, hard, Asteroid mode or mission mode. All of which are fun.I will keep playing this game as I've beenr eally enjoying it so far.

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine  PLEASE NOTE: I recommended this game with some exceptions, overall if the game did not live up to just a tiny expectation, I would not have recommended it at all, so please read the review carefully if you are thinking of buying/playing this gameALSO NOTE: If I (the reviewer) have played a game that has less than 1 hour of gameplay and is recommended, means that I did not enjoy it but it passed a bit of my level of expectations! Think twice before buying/playing this game(This only applies to some games that have been recommended, not all, please read above before reading the review below) PARTICLE MACE is... meh, it is not a terrible game nor is it a fantastic game!Its a fun game for only short playtime bursts. After a while it gets boring, it just throws you the same missions over and over again but what I like is that there is an Acrade option as well as an online co-op version to play with your friendsOverall, its a fun game but only to play in short bursts RECOMMENDED :)  Provided it is in a sale, price drop, giveaway, gift or even given to you as a free game, otherwise...  NOT RECOMMENDED :(  For its full price  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Short Review>Buys game for 99 cents>Thinks to self, this is probably going to be another stupid indie game>Game downloads>joins game>clicks on arcade mode>plays tutorial>finds out there are no weapons even though they said>I shed a tear>I play easy mode >got to 200 and die>realize there are different ships to unlock with objectives>one ship requires you to beat 35 mission on ""story mode"">I go to story mode>gets bored of story mode and goes right back to arcade>I start to do ship objectives>keeps dying at 399 >400 is the objective>I rage and shutdown my computer>graphics card destroyed.10/10 would shutdown my computer again. LONG REVIEW	So let's just say, time went by so fast with this game. And I am not joking when I said that.I bought the game, thinking ""It's another one of those stupid indie games, but it's 99 cents so why not.""I played the game and I was instantly in love with it. Let me tell you why, well first off you just want to keep playing it over and over and over. Because everytime you die you just have the rather urge/rage to respond again. Not only do you keep having the urge to play it, there are challenges to do to unlock new ships for an example there is a ship called ""Fast"" which obviously makes you move much faster, and your ""circles"" move faster with you. It's just an awesome game, there is multiplayer and I reccomend you getting it on sale. ONE THING I DON'T LIKE! it's 9.99$ which, as much as I love this game and love every single detail, it's not worth the price a single bit. I just got it on sale for 99 cents. If you have the money BUY THIS GAME FROM 9.99 it's worth it when you have the money. But don't try hard on your mom to get you this game. Look, it's not game of the year and not even that popular with only a couple of hundreds of ratings and came at January of 2015, but yet again another indie game impressed me, with proper updates and updates every so then. This game is great with frequent updates and other details you'll have to find out about yourself. ",110,8,0,5,11,1,2

												Compared to any other game I've played, this one is very unique. I've never played a game with this same inertia-based combat, but I love it. There are about 8 different ships you can unlock, each with their own advantages and disadvantages, they are pretty evenly balanced. The three different modes keep you pretty busy, with arcade ranging from easy to hard, to a special asteroids-only mode where there are no enemies, but that only makes it harder. There are 150 different challenges in challenge mode and some of them are pretty creative, such as avoiding the black hole, or destroying X amount of enemies with only two particles. Surprizingly enough, I love the soundtrack for this game. When you first jump into the game is has a calm, 16-bit sounding rhythm, but slowly speeds up the longer you survive, and becomes frantic as the map itself tries to kill you. I went ahead and bought the soundtrack with the game, and I am not disappointed. Since this game is currently $0.19, I suggest buying it right now before it goes back up to $9.99. You won't regret it.			",522,133,11,62,54,6,55

												This game is woth every cent, and at only 19 cents, it's a steal. This is probably the first ever game to make me feel buyer's remorse for having paid too LITTLE for the game.To be fair, yes, this is an unabashed Geometry Wars clone. But, at the risk of sounding insanely hyperbolic, it is to Geometry Wars as GTA is to Saints Row; that is, it has the basic shape, the basic concept of the same game, but produces radically different and thus fun results. Rather than the standard Asteroid tropes of ""you are a lone ship with all of the guns, shoot everything"" this game provides you with a novel twist of having your ammo being the crap, space garbage floating around your ship. It's  bit odd, and has a bit of a learning curve, but once you examine and understand the physics of the game, the action will never stop.			",90,23,0,48,6,0,6

I don't know if its a compatibility issue, or if its a coding problem even though i reinstalled it like 5 times.

												This is the type of game where I wish there was a mixed-feeling button. I played more on another account too, so altogether I have 5 hours at the tiñe of writing this.Pros:-Intuitive controls-Good music-Original design and gameplay styleMixed:-Fun gameplay for the days where you don't know what to play, but somewhat repetitive after some timeCons:-The missions are normally unfair, colliding with each other (aka ""kill x enemies in a short period of time"" and ""survive with only two pellets for x time"", etc...)-30 FPS lock?-Achivement bugs from what I've experiencedKeep in mind I couldn't test the multiplayer. In conclusion, I would get this game when it's on sale (I think it's less than a dollar then?), due to the problems above. I rate it 6/10.			",19,1,5,1,2,0,3

												I have only played some of the single-player part of this game and it is excellent on this basis only. I expect multi-player is even better.There is not much to say to describe the mechanics that isn't already conveyed by the video, but I should say that the availability of several ships and game modes ensure that this game isn't as monotonous as some of the classics it is inspired from.Ah, the “System requirements” section for the Mac on the store page is a bit laconic so I will complete that: this game plays perfectly on a 2006 Mac Pro running OS X 10.7 (Lion) using a GeForce 7300 GT as video card.

												Imagine you're a jellyfish in space. Your tentacles are your only weapons as you try to dodge the numerous alien ships and asteroids that are trying to hit your soft, vulnerable body. Seriously, just play it, and you'll get what I mean. Btw, super fun, with plenty of achievments, ships to unlock, modes, etc. Just trust me, it's worth it. It's atmospheric, challenging if you want it to be, relaxing if you want it to be, and pretty much has something for everyone. It's super easy to understand as far as the controls and the objectives, but you'll find yourself strategizing to outwit your enemies, even if you just buy the game as a relaxing time-passer.

												Ok, I just have to say this game is straight up the best games I have played this season. Reason? The missions are very creative, and it allows you to experience the different types of scenario of what the game decides to give you. The CO-OP/Deathmatch are the most fun to play with your friends, hell, as hard as the game seems when you play it on the big screen, it's very entertaining to watch everyone work together. The game supports controllers, which is pretty cool imo (but tbh, it's easier than using the mouse, however it's just preference on what your game style may be when it comes to this game) Thank goodness it was a dollar, get it while you can before it's back to ten. This game is really worth getting.			",90,8,1,3,4,0,9

												Super Hexagon 2: Revelations finally comes to Steam again and this time, it's personal.You play as Commander Shephard in a fight to save humanity from geometry with rocks on strings.  You face off in the ultimate arena known only as ""arcade.""  This game is different from most games on the market because your decisions actually mean something, just like the original Super Hexagon (no TellTale here!).  For instance, the ""score"" in the bottom left corner isn't a score at all; it shows how many humans the combine will keep alive to enslave when they take over Pandora (the higher number the better btw).The story is very complex.  There's tons of sexual tension between the rocks and a triangle, and you, the player, can decide where to put it.  Will you release the tension by having alien sex like in Star Effect, or will you build it up to become stronger like in 1984 by George Orwell.  Like I said, your decisions really affect the story, and the better decisions you make the more story you get.  But of course, the best decision you can make is to get this game.9.8/10 ""good game""			",202,45,3,27,25,0,14

												this is a surprisingly good game. it manages that easy-to-learn-but-hard-to-master-oldschool-arcade-feeling and kept me playing for more than 2h on my first play session. you can find a lot of games that try to take a classic game concept (in this case: twin stick shooter / asteroid) and then put a ""twist""  to it, but most of the time those seemingly interesting ideas don't add up to really engaging gameplay. well, PARTICLE MACE shows how it's done right. the swinging mechanic is a very simple addition, but works brilliantly and brings another dimension to the challenge.  and the varying obstacles and goals keeps it engaging.  long story short : this is really good game design! i never would have spend 10€ for this type of game and judging by the screenshots -  BUT after my first play session i actually think it's really  worth the money.

												well I would make a funny and witty review for this gamebut  I just can'tthere is nothing that urks me, nothing standing out, no glitches (as far as I can tell) its just a great gamethe mechanics are fun, they are unique and it just feels satisfying to swing the mace around and kill several enemies at once, it's cool to take out a whole bunch of asteroids all at once, I feel like a badass swining my mace around all to simple graphics reminicent of older gameshonestly do I need to say more? the graphics are simplistic, the gameplay is solid and unique (dont know any other game like it) and the whole game is just awesome, get it, you wont regret it.

												I originally bought this game because it was on a good sale, but unlike most of my purchases with this mindset, I was very impressed by the creativity and fun that the game has to offer. It's a simple concept, but it's fun and great for multiplayer :D The only cons I have are that you need a controller to play and the controllers that I have, (GameCube controllers with a Mayflash adapter, yes I know I'm a nerd) don't work properly and the game glitches while trying to configure them properly.  They work fine in Xbox mode usually, but you can't change ships in any multiplayer mode while using them. Since I'm probably one of the 1 or 2 people with this problem, don't let it stop you from buying the game!			",161,21,0,22,12,0,9

												Particle Mace is a neat little arcade game with a more modern approach!I'm not very into arcade or score-attack games, in general, so this is definitely not a game I can get much out of. Regardless, I think it's a pretty good game, getting quite a lot out of such a simple concept.The gameplay is very simple: it's similar to asteroids, but instead of shooting in front of you, you have a bunch of particles tied to you by ""strings"". These particles kill enemies on contact, so you're trying to swing them around you while avoiding collisions.One hit KO ensures pretty fast rounds, for the most part.Aside from the more traditional arcade modes, where your objective is to get the highest score, you get Missions mode. In this mode, you get 3 missions to complete at any given time, out of 150. When you beat a mission, you get another, and so on. This is pretty standard, these days. But Particle Mace gets the upper hand by introducing missions with tweaks to the actual game. For some missions, there are no enemies, asteroids and much bigger, maybe the background color hides certain enemies, maybe you need to race for certain points, etc.The changes are quite varied, and they mostly bring something new to an otherwise repetitive experience, focused on score alone.These missions also unlock ships (and does scoring high on arcade modes). Unfortunately, there few ships, and most of them aren't very usable, in general. Maybe in some specific situations, but I kept using one or two of the ships 80% of the time.Perhaps some more manual customization (with perks) would have worked better. Of course, it would have a different balance, so yeah... The point is just that the ships didn't seem to balance towards one particular direction, but actually be more gimmicky.So far, so good.There are 2 problems that I have with it, though. One of them stopped me playing. The other, I think could have extended my investment in the game, but seems to be tailored towards the score-attackers, which is a shame, as it could have appealed to both!The first is how some of the missions are conflicting with one another. Some are synergistic, but some make others almost impossible. For example, wanting to kill X enemies while having to survive for Y time without particles. You can't kil anything until you beat the latter mission... Some are more subtle, like trying to race through all the points while avoiding killing anything -- they're not mutually exclusive, but close. This problem is aggravated, somewhat, by this being a physics driven game -- It's more unpredictable, leading to some undesirable situations. Nothing new, I guess.But hey, overall, I thought the game was still pretty cool! Unfortunately, when I was at 137/150 missions, I had a set of two missions that made progress literally impossible.I had to survive for 60 seconds (60!) without particles. Also, I had Mega Asteroids that filled the screen. The asteroids closed in on me in less than 5 seconds. There was absolutely no path to take. It's certain death. And there's no failsafe for these situations. The only ""solution"" is to reset all of my progress. Yeah... no thanks.As you can imagine, that's rather annoying. Specially with no accounting for it.This could be solved by, for example, getting some currency for score in Mission Mode, and then using it to ""re-roll"" a mission into another, for example. It would be back sometime later, but you could postpone an immediate problem like this. Either that, or actually disabling a mission.Since it's impossible to make progress, I simply quit playing.The second problem is how the achievements' bar is far, far too high. There are quite a few achievements, but they're *all* for very high scores. You can only start earning some when you've already invested time and effort into it -- sure, that may be the idea of an achievement, which I recognize. On the other hand, achievements can also be a way of keeping people interesting. For me, as I'm not a score-attacker, having some easier achievements to pursue could be good. I'd still be pursuing something, get invested, and then may even by invested enough to go for higher scores. As is, the achievements are purely for higher level players, I guess. Not too big of a deal.Anyway, I've written a bit too much about this game.It's neat, and it works well, for the most part. I definitely feel like 10€ is too much, but since the game is on sale for 19 cents, you should definitely buy it, as it is pretty fun and well made!			",472,130,11,42,29,3,58

												This game is surprisingly great. It can serve as a casual occupy-myself-for-five-minutes, or you could spend an hour intensely focused on completing missions, unlocking ships, or maintaining a combo for as long as possible. The multiplayer doubles, nay triples the lifespan of the game. The controls are tight and fluent, the physics works how you would expect it to, you can play the game on a toaster, and I have nothing to complain about.Actually, I have one minor complaint. The volume should be controlled by a slider, rather than just mute/unmute. Nothing that ruins the experience, but would be helpful. At least the music is excellent.			",126,27,0,14,12,0,6

												Though similar to twin stick shooters such as Geometry Wars, it's the execution that makes this game different. First off you have no shooting style weapon, instead you have a set of particles strapped to your ship. By using momentum to spin or flick the particles, you use them to destroy the asteroids and enemies that come your way. It's a simple concept in premise, but the game itself is challenging. Between the different enemy types, asteroids that break apart as you hit them, and the ever changing arena, there are lots of ways to fail. Multiple unlockable ships vary the game, where each ship has different abilities and different particles. Also different game modes offer different styles of play. The simple graphics feel like the game was made in the 80's, with a obviously modern physics engine. The music is very synth and gives a great energy to the game. This is a great pick up and play game when you just have some time to kill, but offers enough depth to keep coming back again and again.			",165,70,6,30,20,3,21

												I came into this hoping for a dual-joystick shooter like Geometry Wars. It's not. It's a one-stick ""shooter"" - you use one joystick to build momentum to swing a mace around to destroy enemies and asteroids, instead of shooting them like you would otherwise. At first I was VERY put off by it, but I spent some time in the challenge / mission mode and started to understand the controls and physics of the game. It's good, but on Steam alone there are similar games that I enjoy more. These other games include ""Waves"" and ""Geometry Wars 3"". Beyond Steam, there's the classic ""Smash TV"" and the rest of the ""Geometry Wars"" series.If you've played a bunch of other dual-stick shooters and still want more, check this one out, but it probably isn't as good as many others.

												This is the most fun I've had with an arcade style game in a long time. It's basically bullet hell without the bullets. The unlockables are challenging but still possible to get, and they each introduce new strategies for success.Love this game, absolutely worth it.			",243,69,0,64,27,1,20
