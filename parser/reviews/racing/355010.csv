								Neat little top down retro racer, with a lot of variety and a track editor. The soundtrack gets you in the mood for racing as well with a good number of uptempo tunes. Takes some skill as the AI is fairly unforgiving and quite aggressive. The cars have solid physics also. Watch those drifts, a drunk driving simulator this isn't!!  A better than decent time waster and a really playable product considering it's early access. In fact, looks not too far off from being finished to me, Very polished. Can only get better with time, Especially once multiplayer is in place. For now, im going to score this a well deserved 8/10.			",318,42,20,32,53,2,69

								Update (4/27/2016): Online multiplayer was added to the game long after early adopters like me stopped playing it, so there's no-one to play with. The game just leaves you sitting in the lobby forever. It's such a shame, because it should be a lot of fun. Alas, I haven't had a single online race, yet. Perhaps when they officially release the game, mulitiplayer will see some action.---Single-player is great. It's fun, addictive and feels complete. I think all the bugs have been ironed out now.You start with a choice of cars, race them in career mode over increasingly challenging tracks and earn in-game currency to upgrade your vehicles. Your AI opponents also upgrade their cars (or bikes, or tractors or UFOs!) so the game remains challenging even when you're fully upgraded. I feel like the AI is sometimes a bit too aggressive, but you can always restart a race if you get pushed off the track.- works great with multiple xbox360 controllers- no support for racing wheels, but the devs are considering itIn its current state, I recommend Race Online for single or *local* multiplayer only.

								Finally been updated and the dev has listened to the small community and made a lot of good changes to improve the game. Before this update I would not have recommended this game but now I'm a little more on the fence. If your picking this up to just play single player it probably isn't worth it but for a bit of a couch bash with mates it goes alright. I'm gonna just give this the edge and recommend it based on the vast improvements the dev has made but only if you really want a simple game like this and possibly best (as like most things on steam) to pick it up on sale.

								Finally updated! This sympathetic little game is now better than ever. One click and once again you're ready to compete against your friends (locally or online) or AI drivers. Still AI won't let you win so easily and you should not be too self-confident because new and updated levels will test your skills - that one last corner can ruin everything! This is your game if top-down racing games are your thing and you're ready to prove your skills.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Race Online is a nice looking retro racer from top down perspective and is somewhat fun to play but if you're looking similar gameplay than in legendary Slicks 'n' Slide or Turbosliders you will be disappointed. The car handling is quite different and isn't what you would expect for a car as they move and handle like solid blocks, get stuck easily and you can't reverse you way out. There's not much difference between how cars (sports car, formula, tractor, etc.) handle and move. Also seems that track obstacle's or car's collision model isn't quite what the graphics show.Overall the game feels ready and I didn't experience any bugs although the game crashed couple of times. The tracks are a mixed bunch, some are nice to race but often tracks are a bit annoying (due AI & collision model) and track profile isn't ""professional"" style. Some tracks look unfinished. The career mode is quite easy as the only difficulty is to get pass the AI cars after start and not to get stuck to them or pushed. Even on harder difficulty levels the difficulty comes from getting stuck to obstacles as the track is narrow and you can't pass or you crash to AI cars which are stuck. Also the grinding part of getting new cars and upgrading their parts feels artificial. The game ran quite nicely on my Macbook Pro (late 2013).As the game is still in early access I hope the developers will enhance car physics and model before the release. They could take some example from e.g. Turbosliders which is fun to play but still competitive. Or maybe developers have played Turbosliders as the graphics and some of the tracks look similar.Will be interesting to see how the multiplayer works when it's released.In this development state I can't recommend this game. I hope the game gets better but I doubt it as the car physics are a big issue for games like these to change later on.			",104,30,8,8,7,1,16

												No option to adjust laps per race :-/ This could become a great game if it would be possible to mod it a bit and to create custom races with more than 4 laps. Also pitstops are missing. Nice base, but it's limiting its own success in my view.			",5,3,13,1,15,0,5

								So let me start by saying I love top down racing games. Played alot of them from Supersprint, Badlands, Skidmarks, Slicks n Slides and Generally. So this game for me was a no brainer. I also like the fact there are plenty of cars on track but this all comes with a downside.I like games to be competative. So for example I am currently doing a 15 race championship and I am leading 2nd place by nearly 100 points after 12 races. So most races despite starting from the back I am in the lead by about 1/2 a lap. When I play a racing game I want it to be competative and this is far from it. The ai lines are pretty bad to be honest and on most tracks the ai is nowhere near the apex on alot of corners so it wouldn't take much sorting out. So given the ai are poor I thought I would have ago online. Nope! Nobody online to play against.p.s Would also be nice if the ai cars had different skill levels so the ones who start near the back make there way through the traffic and therefore would have rivals to beat in championships.Good effort but is boring when winning every race.

								couldnt be more disappointed with a potential trip down nostalgia lane.from inability to reverse , yet can rotate on the spot like a roomba... to the incessant ai's tendency to stick onto you like a magnetic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥... to each car handling like a boat. bad.			",231,34,4,15,8,1,21
