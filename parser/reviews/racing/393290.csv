												This is a complete disaster of a release. For anyone who enjoyed the PC release of Motorhead, this is not it. This is the PSX version. The screenshot previews of the game do not even do the shoddy graphics justice. It gave me a headache to even try to play this in fullscreen, and windowed mode is not much better. This game is also impossible to play with a keyboard, which is what I used to play the game back when it was originally released, and the controls cannot be modified. So please do your best to enjoy utilizing both WSAD and the NUM PAD not only to drive your vehicle, but to decrypt the main menu navigation, as the mouse does absolutely nothing.Please do not waste your money on this game. There were no reviews for it when I purchased it, so I had no forewarning of how bad of a port it would be. You're better off finding the PC port elsewhere. It's a vastly superior experience to this version.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sorry, but this re-release looks terrible. I thought maybe they did something foolish, and chose bad screenshots to show off the game, but no, the game looks worse on my GTX 780 than it did on my Voodoo 2.  Somehow there are actually framerate problems too making it difficult to play.You can see how the game should look:

			Awesome game from 1998. Developed by Digital Illusions (DICE). Music by Olof Gustafsson. Gameplay by me.		

On the plus side, there is controller support, including for xbox 360 controller. Best thing I can say about the game is that the soundtrack is retained (tied with Wipeout XL for best racing soundtrack).Not recommended to actually play the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've just seen all the negative reviews for this game and I had to say something good about it (although I can understand if people were expecting the PC version which I never played personally). This is an amazing game and I'm so happy to be able to play it after so many years! I used to own it on PS1 but god knows what happened to it, probably in the attic somewhere.For those who don't know, it's essentially just a fun little arcade racer with simple controls, challenging AI and an amazing soundtrack. It ran beautifully on my laptop with no issues whatsoever. It's also compatible with Xbox/PS controllers. Definitely worth the £4 or whatever you'd be paying for it.			",17,2,9,4,6,0,0

												In the first moment when i saw that green disclaimer message i thought: ""Oh, no... They ported the PSOne version!"" It would be awesome if it was the PC version. If i wanted to play a PSOne, i would stick to the emulator.			",1469,420,125,86,261,22,172

												This is not the pc version, the question might be why did they release this at all if you played the original you would know how much beter it was. All of twenty minutes to figure out that this games cant be tweeked or configured to overcome the graphic issues before I requested a refund. On a lighter not this game is extremely hard to find on cd I `ve  seen it on cd, amazon and ebay this is probably due to the fact that  Fox interactive went out of business Fifteen years ago.
