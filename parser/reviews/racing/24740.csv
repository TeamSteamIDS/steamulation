												The game itself is good. Really good. You can make cars crash and feel like you're 12 all over again crashing your toy cars against each other and making noises with your mouth to distract yourself from your abusive parents (abusive parents are optional).It's good. If you buy this, you're buying a good game, but I can't recommend it given how Steam is falsely advertising content that is no longer available in this game. You're not buying Burnout Paradise+All DLC, or even Burnout Paradise+Some DLC, you're buying just Burnout Paradise+DLC Advertisements and a DLC storefront that no longer works.And that's terrible.

												I'm sure this review will go unnoticed but that doesn't matter.This game is seriously one of my favorite of all time. Yeah, just another EA racing game released in the 7th generation, but it's a very special EA racing game released in the 7th generation. The best EA racing game released in the 7th generation. Hell, probably the best EA racing game of all time in my book (NFSMW, B3, NFSU2 are all extremely close).PROS:-Beautiful detail. Every crash and car looks spectacular, and some views are simply jaw-dropping.-Hours upon hours of replayability. And when you do get 100%, you have a nice feeling inside.-Some of the best licensed and original music. Also, incredible classical music.-An awesome city known as Paradise City. Pretty big, and has a personality of it's own, in a way.-Very unique things you can do in the game: Ever wanted to barrel roll an F1 car into a quarry while being stalked by Black Armored Cars?CONS:-Of course, with such a large world, there will be very tedious and annoying moments at times.-Depending on the person, this will be a glaring flaw: the only real character, DJ Atomika, is a bit of a jerk.Really good game. If you like racing games, it's a must have. 4/5			",18,4,3,4,3,0,2

												Overall a fun little racing game but the title is a flat out lie. You need to spend quite a bit more money to get the complete game. For this reason alone I cannot recommend this game.Flase advertising should always be punished with negative reviews. Criterion and EA knew exactly what they were doing when they called this edition of the game ""The ultimate box"", and that was to mislead buyers into thinking this was a complete version of the game.EDIT: As this review seems to have gained quite a bit of traction, if you feel the need to comment insulting me or any other people be aware I will remove your comment, do everyone a favor and keep your smug attitude to yourself. This is not facebook or reddit and I will not tolerate ignorant fanboyism from random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s online. I dont care what you think Ultimate means and I dont care how much you love the game and feel the need to defend it. Be a prick and you're comment gets deleted, end of story. That being said if you can voice your opinion without resulting to insults, feel free to criticize anything you want.			",322,37,8,58,20,2,7

												Burnout Paradise is an open world, survival horror game developed by Criterion Games, who are most known for making popular racing titles. The game is set in a horrific post-apocalyptic city, ironically called Paradise City. I can assure you however, there is no paradise to be seen in this hellish landscape.You play as an unnamed, sentient car. The game revolves around completing the same missions over and over in order to upgrade your licence, to prove that you are king of the cars. The missions mostly involve destroying other cars, however, there are some racing elements involved here and there. As a working class peasant who cannot afford a luxury sports car, this appeals to my deep seated resentment of people who have more money than me.[SPOILER ALERT] The story is fantastic. Towards the end of the game, you discover that you are not the protagionist at all. In fact, you are the villian. The real hero of the game is a DJ driven to madness named Atomica. Who has been broadcasting Paradise City's only radio station the entire game. His true motives are to get all of the cars in the city to destroy eachother, so that he can free humanity from its chains and rebuild society. Many games have tried to copy Burnout Paradise's clever plot twist, and have failed miserably. Ken Levine, eat your heart out. You can never hope to recreate this masterful storytelling.In summary, Burnout Paradise is a masterpiece. There isn't a single game in existence that can match its artistic calibre. So I award this game ten out of ten cars. You will never get TYRED of this game.(A lot of people are leaving comments pointing out the similarities to Yahtzees review. Fine, but Yahtzee wasn't the only person to think of this. This was meant to be a small joke amongst friends that just happened to get popular. Whining won't make me take it down.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What a fantastic game. Just an absolute joy to drive around the really attractive city and then jump over a building and smash into a car.A great game to have a quick game here and there in, but at the same time you can spend hours completing races and discovering all the jumps/billboards/secret places.The only downside is that now that the online store portion doesn't work, you're left with a few pieces of the game being there but not accessible.The worst part is the legendary cars, they would be fantastic to have access to.

												10/10Pros:- Well what can I say, Burnout Paradise is the best sandbox racer that was ever made period. - I got over 240hrs of playtime on PS3. - Best 240hrs spent on a racer in my life. - If you buy this game, invest over 5-6 hours into it and I assure you will be hooked for another 50. Unlocking cars, finding all the jumps/shorcuts/garages/billboards is fun.The single player is a blast. The online portion is also. I was amazed that there is still plenty of people playing this online on steam, even late into the life of this game. I don't mind coming back to it every now and then. The best thing about coming back to this game is that I still have a blast like during the first 240hrs I played this game.Cons: - Too bad that the ultimate box on steam doesn't come with Big Surf Island. - You can't add your own music playlist easily like in the console version.Since this Ultimate box doesn't come with Big Surf Island and plenty of optional awesome cars in DLC format. I better go add my precious time on the PS3 version and start a new game again. - God I love this game.- I and plenty of other gamers still wish Criterion would make a sequel to Paradise. Because we would throw our money right into the screen if we ever see an annoucement trailer for a Paradise sequel.  ",236,54,9,21,19,4,19

												I don't usually like racers all that much, but this one is the closest thing I've seen to Skyrim for race lovers.The ""Open world map"" is a nice touch and the slow mo slam camera is wonderful.  You get to choose the type of ""mission"" you like so you're not locked to one thing. If something annoys the hell out of you you can simply do something else! It has a very chill calm ""adult"" approach to it, unlike most of those annoying prepubescent racers that feel they have to throw boobs at you and be over the top ""cool! dude bro!"" to keep you interested. Some issues with online and no window mode, but nothing too annoying.The only racer that kept me interested for more than an hour.8/10 would crash again!			",2490,1025,85,267,283,24,380

 OVERALL RATING: 8.5/10  This game really stood out to me as one of the best racing games on steam right now. Even though it may not be the newest, it definitely seems to have to most unique play style.  Pros Many other objectives than racesFences, super jumps, and billboards are great objectivesOver 100 different carsThe license system is very rewardingControls on Xbox controller are very smoothGreat game to drive around and listen to music toMap has a great combination of urban and rural areas Cons Multiplayer is hard to useRaces can get repetitiveMap is kind of smallImpossible to use keyboard and mouse For more in depth reviews like this one, follow the Latte Reviews Steam curation page here.You can also click here to view my page where I attempt to review all 250 of my games.

												This is a great racing game that's all about driving in the open world of people-free Paradise City, of which the title song claims has green grass and pretty girls.  Along the way, you'll be bombarded with advertising billboards for such things like Burger King, EVGA motherboards, Crash FM, and this very game.  Sadly, you can only demolish one of these billboards, which keep reappearing continuously.  Somehow, I feel real sorry for the cleanup crews having to fix up the damage caused by driverless cars.  It's like Twilight Zone stuff, man!While you repeat the events that you've already cleared with each new license, you get to hear a selection of licensed songs that usually repeat a pretty good deal.  Or you can listen to past Burnout songs from a time Acclaim published those games.  Maybe you just feel like listening to that Avril Lavinge song over and over.  Did you know that song was also in Burnout Dominator AND in multiple languages?  There are also classical songs in the game, but nobody listens to those. ;)The damage model is quite glorious, parts flying off, cars flipping about, and [my favorite /s] the game going into super slow motion because you were too slow in reacting to a barrier right in front of you.  It's like you know you're going to be taunted mercilessly, especially if you crash mere seconds before the time trial expires.  But if you feel like crashing into things and causing mass destruction, there is a Showtime mode.  It's not quite like the crash modes in previous games, but it counts for something.Even with the minor flaws like the lack of a certain bit of DLC that the potato consoles got to enjoy, super slow motion crashes that test your patience, and the general grind with each new license, this is still a very enjoyable racing game that people continue to play to this day.

												A case of paradise found, or paradise lost?I've played all Burnout games since Point of Impact, except Dominator. Paradise seemed just as exciting as previous titles in the series to begin with, but by the end it became an exercise in anger management. Having completed it on the PS3 I thought coming back to it on PC was going to be a cakewalk. If only.Enjoying Paradise depends on a lot of ifs. Where you are at in the game, how much you intend to play, and how easily things annoy you, for starters.The game dumps you on a map and basically says 'Enjoy!', leaving you to discover everything it offers for yourself. Perhaps the first and biggest wonder you'll notice is the miraculous lack of people - even the random cars you see on the road are all empty. Even your own car. Compared to games like GTA this is a bit of a sore point for me - having someone to run over and some voice-acting to laugh at would have been a nice addition. The only voice there is to listen to (besides the soundtrack / music) is DJ Atomica, who never ceases to bring you down with some disparaging remark when you lose an event. Sometimes he's ok, but the game would have been better off without his five pence of 'try harder' and 'the route you choose' bull.If driving around in Robot City isn't a problem for you then you might like this title. There is a big garage of awesome looking cars to unlock, and the freedom of having a huge map fully unlocked already means you can pick and choose which roads to use in races and events. Occasionally it can get confusing, but the option is there to check an event's route before you start it, so you can take your time deciding how best to navigate the roads to get to where you need to as fast and effortlessly as possible.Collectibles include challenges (both offline and online - online lists challenges for each of 2 players through to 8 players); smashes (which are construction fences that often fence off short-cuts); billboards (for smashing through as well); and super jumps. Just finding all of these can be a chore. In addition, each road has a fastest lap record to beat, and a crash mode record to beat. Some roads are little, others are huge. Crash mode isn't quite the same as previous games though, where you get a specific set-up and have a bunch of buses all packed together in the distance. Instead, while driving you can start crash mode at the touch of a button (but careful not to start it in the middle of a race). The goal here is to rack up a big $$$ of carnage, hitting traffic, buses, signs, anything with a $$$ painted over it. The event stops when your boost bar empties, but is filled regularly as long as you keep hitting things. This is one of the more fun aspects of the game, but it can be frustrating too, as all too often the crash traffic will spawn on roads you can never possibly reach, sometimes you'll see traffic spawn in the distance only to de-spawn before it reaches you (possibly because too much traffic is spawning on other roads), and traffic has an awful habit of avoiding your bouncing wreck trying to aim for them. Overall it's fun, but I get the feeling it needs a patch or something.Event types are colour-coded on the map, thankfully, as there are over a hundred and finding what you want can be problematic. They are broken down into races, burning routes (car-specific race against the clock), stunt runs, road rages (using your car to take out other cars within a time limit), and marked man (which is the biggest pile of doo-doo since Jurassic Park).The goal of the game is to keep unlocking new licences, ending with the Burnout Elite licence, requiring you to complete everything. Up until this last licence it is possible to avoid most events you don't like, but this last licence forces you into events you may hate. For me it was Marked Man - an event that is akin to a bull in a china shop, with you playing as the china. It seems to me too heavily reliant on dumb luck just to survive the longer distances - repair drive-thrus often being too few or too far away to be of any use. I see it as utterly preposterous and totally unnecessary. Sometimes all you can do is sit and watch in sheer disbelief as attack cars rain down on your humble car from every possible angle, sometimes t-boning you mere seconds after respawning, leaving you no room to escape at all. And to top it all off DJ Atomica will whine at you afterwards, saying you have no skill.Apologies to my brother, Grunner, and my family for all the foul language and violence when I started doing Marked Man.It's a shame but I believe Marked Man events will be a game breaker for perfectionists looking to get 100%. It can be done, but you may find items around you will get broken in your rage. Lots of excessive cinematics in the menu and waiting for cars to drop in before you can choose them to drive make the game unnecessarily longer. The menu is messed up to begin with - you use F1 and F2 to navigate various menus and a web page - not to mention the fail webpage that still tries to load every time you start the game.But the visuals are pretty good considering the game's age, and the soundtrack is pretty beast. If you're a racing fan, need more cars to play with and there's nothing better out there, then you'll get this despite the menu problems or stupid Marked Man. Due to all the enjoyment I've had I can't recommend against it, but it's pretty close. 50/50. Racing probably isn't for me.			",144,135,1,51,6,0,4

Product received for free
												The best racing game ever created. Don't be fooled by my playtime, I have spent over 4000 (yes, fourthousand) hours in this game on my PS3 since it came out back in 2008. I can't say anything negative about this masterpiece. There was so much content on PS3 with all the glitches, ranked racing, road ruling and endless driving. I met so many people through this awesome community, in my opinion one of the best gaming communities ever. I miss the old times, I don't regret any hour I spent in Paradise City and I will always remember every single player I made friends with. I guess it's not the same nowadays, but there won't be any game like this, ever again. I'm a little bit sad that my children won't experience something like this.

												This Game is amazing. i played this game and beat it five years ago. now im back to play it again! this game brings back memories i had years ago. run very well for low end PC's and looks great on mid-high end PC's there is so much to do in this game. start a road rage and crash your competition, do a race to the baseball stadium, set some lap times, or just simply drive around. so many good things to be said about this game, for example, bikes have been added in. great sounds, fun to experiment with, and just so much to do. the cons, however, are that criterion has abandoned this game. which is a shame that all the DLC it had on Console hasnt been brought into the PC master race platform. for example, Big surf island, and cop cars, are missing from the game, and that brings a tear to my eye. it is such an amazing game, filled with action and fun, it makes you want more and more. but i will never be able to fully relive the experience of big surf island or cop cars. still, this game is completly worth $19.99, although it was made in 2008.11/10 cannot stop, and will not stop.*EDIT*apparently i cant play the game because i can only use it on one systemnow i cant play it on my gaming pcthanks ea			",52,2,19,1,1,0,1

												Good game overall, although the box isn't perticulary ultimate. ""The Ultimate Box"" includes 3 out of, as far as I can tell, around 8 DLC's, one of which isn't even available for PC. Plays good with 60+ FPS on most systems. Will provide atleast 200+h of racing and gameplay until you have completely finished the game. I, personally, have sunken around 90h in this game and I've unlocked around half of the cars and just a fraction on all the jumps and secrets. But then again that might just be me being terrible at playing games.TL;DR: Good game. Tons of gameplay hours. ""Ultimate box"" isn't ultimate what so ever and will ♥♥♥♥ you over.			",63,5,1,6,4,0,0

												Best ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ arcade racer I've played since Midnight Club 3.  Highly recommend.A lot of people say the game is falsely advertised, but it's not.  Nowhere in the description does it say the game comes with the DLCs.  ""The Ultimate Box"" means it comes with all of the update packs + the Party Pack, which it does.  Check the description.Without the DLCs you still get 79 vehicles, and each of them handle uniquely.$20 is asking too much for this game, but for $5 it's a must have for fans of classic arcade racers.  Buy it along with NFS Hot Pursuit for $5 and you have yourself well over 50 hours of mindless, classic arcade racing fun for just $10.			",329,17,41,12,30,2,9

												I love the Burnout Series so when I saw this on the pc I had to have it.As always it has cool music, races, take down and other modes.Unlike in other parts you must drive up to for instance a race so start it.Which can also be annoying if you mess it up and have to drive a long way back.

			GT 2400 Burning Route on Burnout Paradise Pc. Played on a keyboard, it shows what makes this game so awsome! Driving at high speed threw the city trying not to wreck yo self.		

The game has allot of game time, atleast 30 hours if you go for 100%Many cars, cars also have different boost types now and it was a good buy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												PSA to everyone buying the game, you can redeem the cd key included with the steam version on origin, where it also has 4 of the dlc missing from the steam version for only $1.50. If the key doesn't work, contact origin support and they should help you like they did me.(This doesn't include Big Surf Island, as that never came to pc. Google that and I believe there was a mod being worked on to port it to pc, but I'm not too sure how far it got.)Edit: Also the cops and robbers never made it over either, but the cars did get ported in the same mod that's working on bringing Big Surf Island over.

												One of the most frustrating games to play I've ever seen. It forces you to log-in via EA's log-in system, which is frustrating to no end before you even begin the game. Then it forces you to sit through an unskippable cutscene telling you how to drive a car, and how wonderful this great city you'll spend your time driving around in. Followed by a tutorial to teach you which button is the gas pedal. Followed by unskippable cutscenes explaining every single race. It's like they knew this would be a horrible game, so they make you sit through as many cutscenes as possible so you can't actually play. What was the biggest deal-breaker, besides the boring gameplay, the constant cutscenes, and the didactic edification? You can't quit the game without being froced to pass through EA's ""Burnout Store"" so they can panhandle you to make in-game purchases. Speaking as a lover of the Burnout series, this is a sleazy and nasty puddle of bile on top of a poorly made game. There are infinitely better racing/driving games. Play those.

												Incredibly fun, but you'll have to work your way past the in-game sales features that were stripped out of the game when the developer abandoned it.  This means that periodically, you'll hit a button or trigger an event that takes you to an all-white screen you have to mouse you're way out of.  It may not sound like much, but it turns a complete product into a constant reminder about the developer didn't care about end users at all (oh, it's EA, no wonder).Since they didn't have the decency to patch the game and remove the offending elements (as if that would have been to difficult), this game can be considered irresponsibly abandoned, and without warning on the store page, I can't up-thumb it in good conscience, regardless of how much I enjoy the gameplay.

												First off, this is an awesome racing game, and its worth the buy, especially if its on sale. The environments are beautiful and varied, and just free driving around to kill time is fun as hell. But I feel the need to address things I saw in other reviews, so here goes.1. YOU CAN PLAY WITHOUT LOGGING IN. I forgot my login so I just have to start over. Simply hit cancel and on the next screen, ""return to game"". It will let you play offline only. Only thing is without that login you can't play online.2. There are graphics and controls options. They're in the ""Configuration"" launch option.3. Controllers seem to work fine. My 360 controller is plug and play no issues. (RB changes music) 4. Ignore the people complaining about the unrealistic physics or lack of a speedometer or manual. It's a game with arcade roots. It's not trying to be Gran Turismo.All in all it's a fun, addictive racing game that can be kinda annoying in terms of difficulty later on, but its pretty damn fun, with an awesome sense of speed.One knock on EA for not making the DLC part of the package and hard as **** to get your hands on, especially since this is supposed to be an ""Ultimate"" box.My rating: 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Somehow still the best open world racing game ever made.Multiplayer is surprisingly still alive, but the server is a bit of a recluse.To connect to it, you first need to make an EA account elsewhere.  If you try to log in to Burnout Paradise with this right away, the server will claim it doesn't exist.Instead, ""create an account"" though Burnout Paradise,  using the username and passord of your EA account. The server will now check with EA if it exists, which it does. Tada! The Burnout Paradise server are now aware of your account!Restart a final time, and log in with your account. A minute or so of loading, and you should be in, and online.Enjoy your visit in Paradise city!			",34,7,1,8,14,1,11

												This game represents the concept of an open world title done to almost perfection.Every corner of the world has something to do in it, and you can race your friends' times for any street. Not to mention that there's only a bunch of locations where races end, leading you to become familiar with the city pretty fast, and shorcuts are full of rewarding to get collectibles.The driving itself is good (we're obviously talking arcade here tho) cars handle nicely and there's enough variation amongst them and the 3 driving styles (Stunt, Race and bumping into things) to spice up the gameplay, not to mention that the Burning Races are a really good way of giving you sidegrades of your current cars while making you familiar with your garage and counting towards the license wins.Music is fantastic and graphics are bearable by today's standards, but good for the time.And it's a blast to play.

I've been playing this game on and off for a year and I still don't know all the roads.Well done EA and team. This is one incredible game.

												Had this game back when I was 10 on console. Must have played 100+ hours on it just driving around, not completing missions or anything. Times were simpler back then... Seeing a car be crushed into a small cube was just as entertaining to me as an entire campaign of singleplayer content. I bought this game for PC years ago when it was on sale but never played it because I had no doubt in my mind that it wouldnt run on my potato computer. Yesterday (as of writing this review) I decided to install it just to see how bad my frames would be, and suprisingly I was able to run it at low settings at a decent 30 frames per second. It was the best feeling driving around paradise city again for the first time in 6 years. It also proved that little has changed in what can and can't keep me busy for hours on end.

-Quick Review-Welcome to Paradise island, the island where you can run over almost everything, jump over everything else, and crash with little to no consequences. Burnout Paradise is an Open World racing game developed by Criterion Games and released in 2009.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: You start the game with a quick introduction to Paradise Island, after your introduction you try to accumulate “marks on your licenses” to progress to the next licenses and unlock new vehicles.You earn Marks on your license by completing the various challenges, there is always a challenge at every intersection.... leaving you plenty of races, bumper cars, stunt drives, and chases to keep people entertained.The primary vehicles you'll play as are Cars, but they do have some motorcycles in the game and some “toy vehicles”. In general this has a lot of vehicles which are very much wasted on me, because I just crash into the other vehicles because I'm childish and want to play bumper cars.Gameplay: There are three car “classes”, and different stats with each car. Stunt class cars will get you boosts by preforming tricks, Aggression class cars get you boosts by being a jerk (I really like playing Aggression cars and cackling evilly as I push an NPC into the wall), and lastly Speed class cars, which you fill by near misses, upon filling the boost you can preform “burnouts” which let you boost after your boost meter runs out, so in a way you could just keep boosting... as long as you don't crash in between boosts.Like most car games, there are also specific stats on the various vehicles, some cars have high Speed, others have high boost, and still others have high Strength. Speed = you go faster. Boost = you have more boost you can charge up. Strength = your car can take a bigger beating from the competition.Achievements: There are no steam achievements for this game, at this time. However there are plenty of in-game unlockables that you can obtain. It's important to note someday there might be steam achievements, because on the Xbox there are 60 achievements on the core game, + 10 with the various DLC expansions.Price: Burnout Paradise is priced at $19.99, you can easily spend an hour for every dollar spent playing this game, there's a lot to do. That is the theme of Open world games. As I commonly do in my reviews, I suggest you wait for a sale to purchase this game, if you purchase it... I got my copy of the game on a Humblebundle.Before you buy, one final note: There are a number of reviews out there on this game saying that this game has been falsely advertised. I cannot speak from experience because I never played this game anywhere else. You're only getting the core game with the Purchase of “Burnout Paradise: The Ultimate Box”, in other words if you look up DLC for this game, all of that is unavailable. You cannot even purchase the DLC on steam. For die-hard-Burnout Paradise fans, that's a tough knock. So it's worth noting that you're not getting “the Ultimate Box”, you're just getting the core game.Conclusion: To quickly recap: Story – not really a selling point. Gameplay – fun, even if you're not very big on car and/or racing games. Very forgiving when you crash early in the game. Achievements – Nonexistent. Price – Fair, I suggest waiting for a sale. Remember – you're only getting the core game.All in all, this is a fun car game which can be appreciated regardless of how obsessed (or couldn't care less) about cars. I recommend this game for people who enjoy racing games, or want to give a driving game a shot, keep in mind the open world aspect is a big appeal to certain gamers rather then others.

												Doesn't ""Ultimate Box"" signify all the DLC from the ""Ultimate Box""? Or was that just a marketing ploy to make more people buy it? That seems closer to false advertising than anything else.Either way, I don't see any DLC apart from the pass-the-controller Party Mode, which is fairly useless on a PC.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Are you looking for a different racing game, or planning to get into the racing genre? Then this might just be the game for you! Burnout Paradise isn't your usual racing game, but will still supply you with hours of fun!The racing genre has many subcategories, and the burnout franchise might just be an entire subgenre on it's own. You still have the basics like racing of course, but EA has a different look at racing. You can crash into things, crash other racers, make stunts while still aiming for the first place.GameplayThe main concept is still the same. You are in a car, dropped in Paradise city, have fun. The physics aren't too different from other games, but I felt that drifting has been kept to a minimum. Which isn't necessarely a bad thing, especially not in a city full of buildings and other cars.Like I said before, you are able to crash into everything, breakable or unbreakable. Remember however, that it doesn't mean your invincible. At least, not in most events. Fortunately, there are several repair stations around Paradise City so that shouldn't be the biggest of your problems.You start off with a basic car at a junkyard, and the game will teach you several things before you start the journey. However, it does barely to not teach about the controls, which is something you have to find out yourself unfortunately. If you're familiar with racing games, then this won't be any problem for you, but it may be annoying for new players.Each car has 3 stats, being Speed, Boost and Strength. It is up to you to seek the best combination which both fits your driving style and is the most useful in events. Events are scattered all around Paradise City, of which I have a few examples below:Races - I can't make it more obvious. The great thing about Burnout however, is that you decide your own route. That's right, you are not stuck on a set route where you just have to show your skills and prove your the best. Shortcuts and ramps are your best friends in Paradise City.Road Rages - Personally my favorite of the bunch. Your goal is to take out a set amount of cars in a set amount of time.Take overs - This has nothing to do with racing whatsoever, but it is still fun. Think of it as a minigame, where your car is like a ball, trying to hit as many objects as possible to get crash dollars, which are mandatory for completing the event. I will admit that this event gets boring after a while, and you have to do this event a lot if you're seeking completion.When you complete an event, it sometimes occurs that there's a new car racing through the city. You can take it out and add it to your own collection! Also, you get a new car every time you upgrade your license. Your license gets upgraded every time after you have completed a set amount of events.PresentationThe game is still part of the racing genre, but still does many things different from other games in the same genre. Instead of selecting events, you are racing through Burnout Paradise, which is the overworld itself! I won't touch the graphics however. Graphics is something strictly personal to people, so I can't give my opinion on that. For me however, the graphics are pretty good and fitting of the game. You can see far ahead of you and I haven't experienced any lagg or framedrops during my playthroughs of the game.We now have Steam music, but I still want to mention that the music selection in Burnout is pretty good. There is music for everybody, from metal to opera to classic. Of course, there is also the narrator, being the dj of this radio station, who will give you advice during the game.There are a few things I have to mention, that may not be appealing to several people. For example, cars aren't customizable. The only things you can change to your car are the colours. I personally don't mind this but I can understand that other people do.To go online, you are also required to have or creat an EA account. It's not too big of an issue, unless you are strictly against it of course.The final stepsBeating the game isn't too hard. It only requires you to complete events until you got the final license. I would recommend trying to take on as many different events as possible, because otherwise it might become boring/repetitive over time.Completing the game however, turns out to be a more difficult journey. The game does not have Steam Achievements, but there are in-game achievements called Paradise Awards. They are technically the same as Achievements, only that they won't show up on your Steam profile.I myself am not a completionist, but it does bother me that the game handles collectables rather poorly. There are Super Jumps, Billboards to destroy and Fences to drive though. Unfortunately, When you achieve a colletable, it does not show up anywhere on the map for example. You will most likely have find them all by the end of the game, but it's still a nitpick which I can't overlook.ConclusionBurnout is a really fun game that I would recommend to anyone looking for a new fresh experience. People familiar to the racing genre might find a few nitpicks, but may still find a lot of fun here. And while this may be different from most racing games, this may still be a good starting point for newcomers to the genre.While not necessary, it is recommended to play this game with a controller/ ",304,66,16,55,23,1,21

												Burnout Paradise is an intense arcade racer with spectacular crashes.  The graphics are beautiful, the world is open and grandiose, and the races are mixed and varied.  The difficulty levels range from super easy to absolutely difficult and there are a bunch of collectables throughout the entire open city for you to collect.  One of the best racing games I've ever played.  Get it and have fun.			",1327,517,57,145,105,15,209

												This was one of the original break-em and smash them racing games. My first introduction to the burnout series was Burnout : Revenge for the original xbox. Revenge was action packed and had very smooth game play. This game compared to it's predecessor is good but lacks fluidity and solid core mechanics. I would recommend Flatout Ultimate Carnage over this as it has more mini games, is less of a grind and for me was more engaging. Unlike Flatout, Burnout Paradise let's you explore the open world with some new vehicle types. Paradise city is an open world crash-em-up racer. The gameplay is pretty sound but can have some hiccups here and there regarding fluidity. You may drive around town freely and look and participate any event that is currently available to you. To start events, simply drive up to the event circle and press the gas and brake at the same time. These events come in the forms of Burnout Route/Burnout Ride (specifically for motorcycles) in which you race the clock for modified parts for your car, marked man which you race to a specific point while dodging enemy AI players trying to crash you, road rage mode where players are required to take out a certain amount of cars to proceed, stunt mode where air time, rolls and spins earn you points and finally Road Rules. There are two ""modes"" to road rules : time and showtime rules. Time is like a time attack whereas showtime requires the player to cause as much havoc to traffic as possible. The main sell point of this game is to do ""take-downs"", meaning taking out an opposing car. Hitting cars with a good momentum will send them on their way with a nice cinematic crash video effect. Naturally, as you progress through the game, you are able to choose different cars in your garage given you've completed different events and tasks. There will be random race cars sometimes cruising through the streets waiting for you to take them down. There is no real set agenda regarding which car comes first or which car you see. Upon catching up to them taking these newly found cars out, these cars will be added to your garage. If you don't manage to take the car down or don't feel like it, chances are it will appear again (so don't panic)! There are quite a few car frames to choose from such as cars, vans, police cruisers, roadsters, classics, SUV's, F1, motorcycles and supercars. Cars have three criteria/ratings in regards to their performance. The three criterion's are speed, boost rating and strength. Different cars prefer different ways to acquire boost. Some vehicles rely on speed, others rely on aggressiveness to fill their meters while another category relies on stuns. There are other specific boost types but are very particular to a small amount of cars. Some cars have such good performance (I'm talking the special cars you acquire way after) that they do not have boost.   The graphics are actually quite good and some of the crash effects and visuals are really nice to watch. Although be it easy to knock some players out, it is still satisfying to see everything break apart. The sounds are pretty good and do a decent job immersing the player. Car sounds and crashes have a pretty good range and don't sound all the same. The game like I said is nice to play (with different vehicles such as motorcycles) but in my personal opinion is missing that umph factor when hitting opponents. The damage scheme is great, however the impact engine doesn't let you feel how hard you are hitting another car. Not only that, every time you do get a hit off the game sort of stops for a scenematic. I like fluidity; the fact that Flatout gives you a chance to recover whereas Burnout doesn't is up to the gamer to choose the preferred style. For that reason I would have to recommend Flatout Ultimate Carnage over this game. If you like what you see then I recommend it, if you want a racing game with a bit more depth and challenges I'd go for Flatout. It's an average game in my opinion without a speedometer (unlike flatout)!RATING : 7/10 Gameplay B- Story/Campaign B+ Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B Replay-ability B- Overall B- ",195,9,17,10,23,2,18

												-As a general disclaimer to anyone willing to purchase Burnout Paradise: The Ultimate Box, the game was made for consoles and later ported to the PC. -This version of the game doesn't include *any* of the DLC as they cannot be purchased anymore (The Burnout Store was closed). If you buy the Ultimate Box, you will get all updates that the game has received, including but not only Day and Night cycles and Bikes. Please also note that the major Big Surf Island DLC was never released on the PC by the developers.-Online multiplayer can still be played, but there are barely any players on there.-Without any of the DLC, there's still a good amount of cars in the game to try out (Around 70-80 of them).Leaving that aside, for its price, the game is definitely worth it. You get a game that redefined its genre at the time, and still somehow manages to please till date. The speed and feel is extremely thrilling, and I find myself moving from side to side, even though all I'm technically doing is pressing a few keys. The open world is fantastic and the physics, amusing. Despite the date, even the graphics are phenomenal. Highly recommended even for people who haven't played racing games before (Me).

Definetly worth buying again.Before you buy, be aware the DLC packs that are purchasable are NOT included. You will have to buy them. The good news is the DLC is on Origin for USA at $1.49. But don't buy it until you complete the game. The Time Savers is included and will unlock all the cars for you. So you don't get to enjoy taking them down when the become unlocked as you progress.

												Burnout Paradise will remain in the history of gaming as one of the best driving games. This game has a beauty that few racing games have, this is a game made with soul and it feels like one. Great soundtrack, and if you wanty the best advice from me, here you go:- set your game to night only and drive only with the classic music on. The feeling can't be described I assure you.Paradise City it's a place to be, free racing, great speed and crashes, not to mention the stunts you can do. I should know since I have a ELITE Driver Licence in Paradise City (100% game completion).10/10.			",1240,350,64,132,90,15,216

												This by far my favorite car based game of all time. Racing, doing stunts, and destroying stuff, including other cars, is the main point of the game by doing certain missions. You unlock cars sort of quickly by doing missions and upgrading your license by completing races, burnouts and stunt runs. Overall this is a fun game for anyone who loves anything that includes cars or just games in general.			",43,1,1,2,0,0,1

												Burnout ParadiseStory - Ok I'm not sure if this is story mode, but I'd count at it. I'll explain what you gotta do in a sec. There are 5 types of events, Races, Marked Man, Stunt Run, Road Rage, and Burning Routes.Races ~ Pretty self explanatory, race with other cars (or one car) to a point on the map. They're not laps, it's just get from one point to the other. A to B.Marked Man ~ Heavily armoured and fast cars are trying to take you down, you have to get to a destination on your map. It's harder than it sounds. I'm pretty good at racing games and I've failed a coulpe times at this.Stunt Run - You get points for each stunt you make, all you gotta do is do enough stunts to pass the score limit.Road Rage - Destroy a number of cars before the timer runs out. This is my favourite one.Burning Route - It's like a race, except you're on a timer and there are no cars racing you. ""Well then what's the point of this?"" If you beat the time limit, you get a better version of the car you own. They're actually quite fun. 10/10Storyline Length - A long time. Very long. You'll play for days on end.AI - On everything EXCEPT Marked Man, they're a bit weak and slow and dumb. They're still fun to play against, but I'd love a difficulty setting. 7/10Experience - You also get to play on a motorbike, which is amazing. Anyway, around 75 cars to get, and like 3 bikes to get. All the missions are fun, and there are even yellow gates to smash through and billboards to destroy! You can also set a time road rule and showtime record on a road. Play the game and you'll know what I mean. This game is awesome. Enough said. 10/10Graphics - I love them. They're not realistic, but they're not cartoony. They're just as you'd expect a game from a few years back to be. Just amazing. 8/10Sounds / Voice Acting - The radio is just amazing, I'm not even saying that lightly. It has literally one of the best soundtracks of all time. The DJ's voice is nice to listen to, it grabs your attention and the car sounds are beautiful! Some cars have a different ""rev"" sound, which is amazing. Can't quite believe the amount of detail in this game. 10/10Controls - Ok before you guys start going ""OMG WASD AND ARROWS ARENT WORKING ARHFDGNFHGNFHN"" lemme tell you the controls.A ~ Move forward.Z ~ Move backwards.Left + Right arrow keys ~ Turn.I don't know why, but I actually very much like it when the controls are layed out like that. 9/10Overall - 9/10 Hands down the best racing game I've ever played it. Finished it so many times in the span of a few years. You'll enjoy it. Buy it! It's marvellous!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm not a racing pro nor a big fan of racing games, but i tried a few. I want to start this review with pros & cons, but these are just my opinions.Pros:Visuals -- The game is Beautiful --Open world -- I played with a few NFS titles and Street Racing Syndicate, and i dont remember that any of them had a real open world racing, and I mean racing, not freeroam. Yeah, I was waiting for that open world racing, but i must admit, that sometimes its very confusing, when you dont know where the finish line is. --Car Damage -- Yeah!!! I like the slowmo car wrecking :) --And I think thats all of the pros in my opinion. Lets check the cons.Cons:UI -- Dafuq!!! No speedometer, no tachometer... Is this a racing game or what? But atleast it has a Nitro bar... excuse me, a Boost bar --Invisible man -- I know that this is nothing, but this is not Knight Rider... I want a Driver in the driver seat --Manufacturers -- Just avoid this if you wish, but the car and manufacturer names are irritating me --Car customizing -- Correct me if im wrong, but the car customization in this game is equal to zero... or almost zero... you can choose from a few colors and paint your car. Maybe I played a bit too much with NFSU 1-2, NFSMW and NFSC, but in a STREET racing game the lack of car customization makes the game rly boring rly fast. And for me the customization, new parts, etc. count as motivation... so yeah i lost my motivation --Story  -- I know, I know... if I want a story, then I should go and play Skyrim. But even in the NFS titles I mentioned before there were events and there was a main storyline, not so detailed as in an RPG game, but atleast I was motivated, but here... i lost my motivation twice. --Publisher -- EA... do I have to say more? --Ingame Store -- Abandoned --Concluson:I really enjoyed the first few hours in this game, its an eye candy and sadly its only an eye candy, nothing more. Its the second day I play with this game, and its boring as hell. I know that my most pros and cons that I wrote are small things, but  small things can make the game good or bad. In this case in my opinion the game failed to be a Good game. Its beautiful, but not even close to be good.To be honest, if u have the chance to win this game on a giveaway, or get it free, then give it a shot, but dont waste any money on it.

												Amazing game, but I can't reccomend it. The developer dropped this product, so if you weren't already a fan, I'd think twice before hitting the buy button on this one. Crashes constantly and is lacking a lot of support and DLC contained in the console version, not to mention the terrible UIs.Amazing crashing game,but then again, crashing in two ways.

												Played this game on most of the consoles as well as PC and i have to say that even though the game is pretty old it has aged pretty well. It still feels as fresh today as the day it was released, The graphics are up there with a lot of the modern games in some cases the graphic's for me are better on burnout. Although not a lot of people play it now, its nice to dig it out and have a wreckfest.			",37,2,5,6,13,0,15

												Okay so Burnout Paradise is really fun but I feel like it has lots of missed potential. Hear me out.- The open world concept is a really good idea, but it doesn't make a lot of sense to then focus all the attention in 8 points of the world map. You're basically making every other place look uninteresting.- You can pick up events all over the map... Or the city should I say, since the areas outside the city almost have none. That makes the areas outside the city uninteresting. After driving through the roads a couple of times I wouldn't have many reasons to return.- Having everything taking place in the city makes the map feel cramped and hard to navigate through. Burnout is not a game in which I want to go slowly so I don't miss anything.- Good luck exploring a whole city without turn by turn navigation. Nobody wants to open a world map while driving. No, the road signs are not enough.- The events in the city make you leave the city almost all of the time. Which means that if you want to play another event you'll probably need to return to the city, and that feels like a loss of time for the player. You should never make the player feel like their time doesn't matter, especially after rewarding them for clearing an event.- The events start to feel repetitive after a while. Even if there are many types of events, if you are always racing to the same place, it gets kind of boring.- It doesn't matter how high you score in an event since the only thing the game acknowledges is if you passed or not. A rank system would have made the experience a lot more interesting.- The menus don't feel natural at all, especially the d-pad menu. This menu demands your attention while driving (or even while an event takes place), and unless you stop the vehicle there's no way to drive and navigate through the menu without crashing. It doesn't make sense to put the ""Restart last event"" option in a place like that.- There's no explicit way to exit an event. You have to stop the car. I had to Google this. That is not good design.- The way to start an event leads to many accidental starts. You can't expect me not to push accelerate + brake in a turning point for any other reason than starting an event.- The classical music feels like a bad joke that was funny only the very first time. It doesn't fit in the mood of the rest of the game.- The idea of including different types of cars and adding motorbikes was nice, but poorly executed. It takes way too much time to find a junkyard and then change the vehicle for a certain event, not that it matters anyway because at least for now every vehicle seems to be fit for every kind of event. It makes me wonder why make different types of cars in the first place and not make just one kind. If you are going to make different profiles of playable entities at least give me a reason to use them. Choices should have a meaning in the mechanics, apart from the way the vehicle earns boost.- The respawn algorithm is just awful. Don't respawn me in front of a wall. Don't respawn me in front of a jump.- Takedowns don't feel as rewarding as they used to in other games of the series. Where is Impact Time? Why can't you do multiple takedowns at the same time?- No windowed mode?Don't get me wrong, as I stated earlier this game is really fun. But it could be a lot better and that bothers me.

												Serious racing simulator enthusiasts can stop reading, because this isn't the game for you.On the other hand, if you're the kind of person who loves: watching stuff slam into other stuff at 100 miles an hour, vans doing barrel rolls through the air, and the concept of ""getting extra points for driving on the wrong side of the road"", then this is DEFINATELY the game for you.In Burnout Paradise, you start off with one car. It's okay, a little slow, and just generally ""yep, that's a car"". You can unlock more cars by encountering them in the large, open-world map, and then RAMMING THEM INTO♥♥♥♥♥♥ Then, go get your new car, and go nuts. There are many kinds of activities to loudly persue while breaking all known rules of the road. Races, ""Marked Man"" challenges, Stunt Runs, and Burning Routes (which unlock an upgraded version of the vehicle they're associated with). Now, zipping around in singleplayer is fun, and lets you get acclimated with the gorgeous (even this long after release) world of Burnout Paradise. It also lets you get new rides, and so on and so forth. But then you log into Multiplayer, and holy♥♥♥♥♥♥Massive, sprawling, high-speed BRAWLS of ten, twenty, however many cars just roaring along, causing destruction and mayhem wherever they go. Custom challenges, grudge-match crashing, and just general shenanigans are the norm. Think it was hard to nail the landing on a super-jump in singleplayer? Try doing it in multiplayer while four players in large, angry-looking SUVs try to ram you out of the air.In summary: Good for fun, not so good for realism. Great multiplayer potential, but solid Singleplayer. Good price, good graphics, small size on Hard Drive. GREAT soundtrack, excellent open-world map, extreme replayability.			",138,8,3,11,22,1,37

												First off: THIS IS NOT THE COMPLETE GAME.     This ""Ultimate Box"" is missing Big Surf Island, the most substantial DLC which provided a large new area. This DLC was never ported to PC.     That aside, the base game by itself is still one of the best games I've ever played. Back in college my roommates and I sunk over 100 hours into the PS3 version achieving 99% completion and I was still eager years later to grab it on PC. That said, the BSI DLC was truly fantastic and truly missed here, so buyer beware.			",110,38,1,14,8,2,14

												At the core, this game is fun. However, what ruins it is EA. You would think that something labeled ""ultimate"" would include all DLC. This one has 3/9. Another ""feature"" is EA's incessant attempts to get you to make an online account. The gameplay itself is fun for the most part. There is a mechanic that is rather annoying. They introduce artificial lose of steering for no reason. This is when you get hit by another car (which would be okay by itself), or sometimes just completely randomly. This does not affect difficulty much, if at all, but is just an annoyance. I bought this game for $5, out of nostalgia, but I regret paying for it at all. Don't support EA and their bad practices.

												Open world racing from a top notch studio.  So much fun, it still holds up today.  The game itself is great, but ""Ultimate""... not so much.  There was more DLC available, but not all of it actually comes with this game, and you can no longer obtain it. :(  Still worth the purchase, though.UPDATE: More of the DLC is now available: the Bonus Vehicle Pack, which includes 4 separate add-ons previously available only on consoles.  You can buy a key for it on Amazon for $10, but as of just recently, you can purchase it straight from Origin for $1.49.  You'll need to register your activation key with Origin first (if you bought the original game here), and then you can get the DLC. Once it's registered on your Origin account, the content should show up in-game, even if you play it from here, as long as you're signed into that Origin account in the game.It's still missing ""Cops and Robbers"" and ""Big Surf Island"", the latter of which is a huge disappointment, as it would have added a ton more content.  It's never been officially released for PC, but there is a (perfectly legal) mod out there (still in development) that actually adds most of the content that would have been included in these 2 additions.  Use at your own risk, results may vary, and because I can't post links, you'll have to figure it out from this:  burnouthints dot webs dot com			",233,32,11,3,7,2,7

												Burnout Paradise, oh where to begin... (Controller Review, I've never touched this game with my M/KB)This game is wonderful, from the up-to-date(ish) graphics to its still perfectly functioning engine and controls.You start off as a rookie driver, starting license, starting car... which happens to be a piece of junk.You complete different kind of events from Road Rages to Marked Man, Stunt events and Casual Races where you get to choose your own path because the entire darn island is your track, your paradise.You unlock new cars, which will be roaming around Paradise city and you have to take them down before you own them and get the option to drive them.You get rewarded some new cars instantly when you upgrade your license by completing multiple Events.This rewarding system makes this game in no way possible... ""Boring"", it makes it beautifully and generously amazing.after a few hours of gameplay you can already feel yourself getting better, see yourself getting better, you can gradually see each new car going faster than the previous one which slowly but surely improves your driving skill, guaranteed no matter how bad you are/used to be in racing games.all in all, this game is a 10/10 would recommend to anyone, fan or not of the Racing Genre.Also, DLC Related: If you own the game on Origin, you can buy the DLC for a $1,70 or something... and this will instantly link it through origin to your EA account in Paradise City.Afterwards, when you run Paradise City through steam and log in to your EA account.. the DLC will be on your game, even on Steam.So if you ever bought the Humble Origin Bundle, use that Origin key because it's still working!

												I don't really play racing games and I don't really like racing games as truth be told I am not all that good, there are however a small number of games I have played and enjoyed, Burnout Paradise though is the one racing game that they have to beat though, because for me Burnout Paradise for me is the best racing game I have played since those early arcade games of the late 80's and early 90's, not that I am making a comparrison between play styles merely the amount of fun I had playing them.At the time of writing this review the game is £9.99 for the Ultimate Box which is the game itself  and all the downloadable content and despite the game's age still represents good value (in my opinion) for a game that has a lot of replayability and also is fun enough for you to want to go back to play it.Would recommend this game to anyone looking for a good racing game or simply for a good game that will be fun to play.

												Can't play it, apparently when I try to create an account the maximum number of Personas have been reached and I can't register an account.What? I go to EA's site but they don't have log-ins, its Origin. I log in to origin but don't see anything about fusing Personas. If I knew what the hell the issue was I'd fix it. I'm not the only one getting this either, Duckduckgo brings me a thread on EA's site where a lot of people have this issue, and it's been marked as 'solved' but its just 8 posts with people saying they have the issue with no solution in the thread.♥♥♥♥ this game. Also apparently 'The Ultimate Box' doesn't actually bring all the DLC as advertised. lol EA. Steer clear of titles needing an EA account. Thank God for Steam's refund policy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't have much to say about this game in sentances, so I'll just go on with pros and cons.Pros:+Good graphics+Not lagging+Cool map+Open world / freeroam+Has races too (quests)+Supports controllerCons:-Sometimes crashes the whole steam app when exiting-Multiplayer can be really frustrating (But thats what the game is about, right? Yep, I just dont like it that way.)-No DLC added in this game. (YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!)After all I think its boring and you can't really play it for 100+ hours while beeing entertained all the time.Its cool with all the crashes but its not really the thing I was looking for.

												For Burnout Racers and players who enjoy playing racing games, this is a game that you will like. It features a big city to cruise around, while being able to smash billboards, security gates, and show off your car in super jumps (if you can find them). The showtime feature brings you into crash mode, which allows you to cause as much damage as possible. It has 120 events for you to complete in Single Player, unlocking more cars as you progress through the game and upgrading to the Burnout Licence. I would recommend this game for racers who enjoy racing games!			",12,0,11,2,2,0,1

												I very much enjoy Burnout Paradise for the open world car type of game it is. There are very few games that are open world and dedicated specifically to cars. The game offers a variety of activites and customizable vehicles for everyone. It's also enjoyable to drive as fast as you can for as long as possible. I would recommend this game if you are seriously thinking about getting it but not to those who just want another game to play.			",80,11,4,8,15,0,13

												Amazing Game. It is a true masterpiece. Of course there is always those slight problems. It is quite a shame that Big Surf Island was never put into this and the Title for the game is quite misleading. Graphics are great as well the the Crashes :3 The Game does have its glitches still and at least some consideration by Criterion Games would we Good. Other than that, Great game though if you do have a PS3 or Xbox 360, probably more recommended to get it on them.			",153,18,11,6,6,3,8

												I used to play this on console and loved it so when I saw a good deal on the Steam version I bought it instantly. Time flies when I'm playing this. I constantly look for gates to smash, even doubling back sometimes! I tend to drive around pretty aimlessly - I usually don't even do any races, just enjoy the driving and finding new places.The online mode is awesome, I still fondly remember the fun I had with random people. I even made some new friends that way.			",49,7,4,4,10,0,2

												I personally enjoy speeding through the city every now and then when I've got nothing else to do. It does get boring quite fast though when you realize that the map isn't as big as you initially thought, as well as there not really being a lot of things to do. You get sick of the map after an hour or so, but when playing with a friend you can still get some fun out of the game. There's different kinds of cars and bikes to choose from, but what vehicle you pick really just depends on your playstyle. Good game, but gets quite boring quick, get on a sale or with mommy's debit.			",170,33,3,18,7,0,11

												Burn out it's a good car game, the gameplay is tuned to arcade mode, like driving in GTA or Saints Row). I played Dirt 2 and could'nt even finish the first circuit. It's fun to play and it says it hass over 70 cars. But the gameplay burns out really quick, all you have to do is: events like race, targeted man and destruction derby; then on the city you either discover shortcuts or detroy billboards, or perform stunts. And that is all, You can play from 5-10 hours before realizing the game is really stale pale, you either go from north to west or from southeast to northwest. 6/10			",552,194,23,60,47,11,81

												In short, this is the best casual racing game for me.If you feel bored with your current game, you can relieve it by play this game for awhile.Anyway, this is an open-world racing game. So when you're in the race, feel free to drive wherever you want as long as you reach the finish line, which is good in my opinion.The another good thing with this game is, I barely hit the brake when I need to drift around the corner.so, yeah...

												Probably still my favourite ever driving game, perhaps tied with Burnout Revenge. The PC port works and plays wonderfully, albeit with a slightly broken store now (you don't get the Toys, Legends cars etc and they're unavailable permanently).But the game hasn't aged a bit in seven years. It's got tight, fantastic driving controls, the missions are fun, and the free-form world, while it takes a bit of getting used to, is fun to explore and crafted incredibly with beautiful attention to detail on shortcuts, different areas etc. As a fan of collecting stuff in games as well, this game totally appeals to me - forget the events when I can go around smashing through all the shortcut gates, billboards, and jumps in the world while taking in the sights.For five quid, this is a steal. I paid £40 for it originally and have had so much enjoyment out of it I still think I got a bargain.			",445,120,18,35,61,6,69

I would happily pay MORE for this game, thats how good it is.Burnout: Paradise is probably still one of the best driving games there is out there. The graphics aren't exactly incredible, but for the date of it's release, they were the♥♥♥♥♥♥ I bought this game when it came out on the PS3, and I decided to buy it for the nostalgia, and I got exactly that! It's an incredible game with literal weeks of entertainment. Hundreds of races/missions and SO many different cars to unlock (including some DLC cars). I would happily pay £30 for this game, THAT'S how good it is. Even though the game being old, there are still multiplayer servers running, which I find really great of EA! EA is not a good company, lets be honest. But this game is actually one of their best ones. I really don't think there is any modern driving game out there which could match up to the standards of Burnout: Paradise. Driving games these days are all so samey, with no real FUN to the game. So what if the game doesn't have 4K quality graphics? I would rather play an average looking game with incredible content than a 4K game with literally no fun aspects whatsoever.10/10 - ""Best driving game out there, despite the age of the game.""

												Can't recommend this game enough i have played it for hours (days) completing it loads of times and i enjoyed every second of it. The game has a great soundtrack is well balanced and well made with an expansive detailed open world map. There are a few negatives, the online events section seems a little abandoned since its quite an old game now and calling this the ultimate box is a bit of a lie as there's very little extra content which doesn't include the island. despite this i hope anyone considering buying this will, i think its the best racing game out there because its the best of the burnout series and nothing better has been made since its enjoyable, immersive and fun i love this game so much and after playing for a couple of hours you will get hooked a sequel game would be nice			",21,2,2,1,2,0,1

												This game is still the best racing game available to the public, in my opinion. Criterion Games may be making the NFS series now, but they can't seem to replicate the awesome intensity of this game, not by a long shot.Paradise City is a big open box of fun, where whatever route you want to take to get to the finish line, is up to you.None of this horsing around with the side routes you aren't allowed on, if there's a path, it goes somewhere, and it's just waiting for you to find out just where that is.Burnout: Paradise follows a single, simple racing law...If you're not in first. Get there.If you're in first, stay there.This game doesn't bother you with a clunky HUD and a speedometer, letting you know that you're traveling faster than everyone else, from last place. There's no rear-view mirror, blocking your view of what dangers might lie before you.You have one objective, win the race. And staring at your speedometer, watching the soccer moms in the mirror won't help you obtain that objective in the least.Race.Race Faster.Win.What a fantastic game.			",109,11,3,12,23,0,16

There are many different types of races, from lap racing and time attack to elimination and drifting. The soundtrack is fantastic. There is a bike mode too, but it seemed unfinished.

If you are someone that is not a fan of racing games then this game will suffice for 8 Hours+ of gametime. ",303,58,5,21,26,2,27

												Of all the racing games I've ever owned, I have to say this one has been the most fun!It feels like the game Need For Speed: Most Wanted really wanted to be but just didn't quite hit the mark.  It's typical Burnout: silly, crazy fun with lots of different race modes in a gorgeous open-world.  Unlock better cars at junkyards, learn bigger and better stunts, beat the fastest record for a myriad set of roads or survive brutal races where you must smash a given number of cars out of the race.  For those who find bikes more fun, this is two games in one!  You can start the game in car or motorbike mode instead, with just as many stunts and unlocks to achieve.This game is also fun for people who don't generally enjoy racing sims.  It's very much arcade-style yet car handling is great with a variety of camera modes to choose from.  The AI is really well made (no rubber-banding or artificial 'cheating' that AI opponents in other games can display).  The difficulty level increases gradually and at the right pace.  It's all enormous fun, light-hearted yet challenging in all the right places.The only problem I've experienced with the game is getting my G27 Logitech Wheel working nicely with it.  People can and do have success, but my wheel has a continuous, strong pull to the left in this game which I cannot resolve.

TL;DR - Worth it for short-term smash-things-up fun (if you're willing to put up with the HORRENDOUS menu screens and EA cramming their DRM and EA-Account stuff down your throat forever), but it gets repetitive very quickly; don't buy if you want to immerse yourself in a new world - buy if you want to drive fast and crash into things for fun.After installing the game, it will take you about half an hour to get past all of the EA login crap for the first time.  After that (and after you get used to the incredibly cheeky way that they swap the 'okay' and 'visit store' buttons all the time), you're confronted with an unskippable cutscene introducing you to Paradise City by the one female presence in the game; speaking in (what is supposed to be) a seductive voice whilst saying stuff like ""here's the observatory"".  It's ridiculous and cringe-worthy, and pretty much sums up EA's attitude towards women here.Once you finally start playing, it's pretty much all good fun.  You can free drive around until you're in the mood to start a race by stopping at the traffic lights, and then you're dropped into either a A->B sprint, a 'takedown' contest where you've got to smash up as many cars as possible, the 'wanted man' event where two cars are trying to take you down whilst you try to get from A->B (my favourite), and finally the 'stunt' mission where you've got to jump and spin and do stuff to hit your target score.  After an ever-increasing number of these events, you unlock a new car - until there's no more missions left - at which point, I guess, you just free roam.It's fun, but very repetitive, and I found myself having the most fun just by seeing how long I could go without crashing, and believe me- it's harder than it sounds.  This isn't a game that will entertain you for all that long; you'll have to make your own entertainment, so buy at the correct price-point accordingly.Definitely not a wholehearted recommendation, but it's okay.  Pros outweigh the cons.			",76,33,1,17,30,1,17

												An awesome game gifted to me by a friend of mine!This game is not your traditional press-fwd-arrow-and-win-racer, because tracks for the races are not scripted and it is an open-world race. You have to know the map like the back of your hand, or constantly open the map menu to draw an imaginary track for your competition, which can get absurdly annoying while you are flying against the oncoming traffic.As I mentioned traffic- this game has somehow too much of it. I know it is a racing game, but regarding the fact that tracks are not scripted, you can crash your car each 4 seconds of a race because of a missed turn or because of too much traffic.At the beginning it is all ok, because the cars that you own are not so fast- you can predict your turns more easily and pass by the traffic, but later on it gets absurdly hard to get to the first place because of the high speeds.Overall a good racing game that is not so hardware-demanding, brings a lot of fun, but in order to ""feel"" that fun, you need to invest in a lot of time studying the city, the shortcuts, jumps etc.I highly recommend it.

												Of all the racing games I've ever owned, I have to say this one has been the most fun!It feels like the game Need For Speed: Most Wanted really wanted to be but just didn't quite hit the mark.  It's typical Burnout: silly, crazy fun with lots of different race modes in a gorgeous open-world.  Unlock better cars at junkyards, learn bigger and better stunts, beat the fastest record for a myriad set of roads or survive brutal races where you must smash a given number of cars out of the race.  For those who find bikes more fun, this is two games in one!  You can start the game in car or motorbike mode instead, with just as many stunts and unlocks to achieve.This game is also fun for people who don't generally enjoy racing sims.  It's very much arcade-style yet car handling is great with a variety of camera modes to choose from.  The AI is really well made (no rubber-banding or artificial 'cheating' that AI opponents in other games can display).  The difficulty level increases gradually and at the right pace.  It's all enormous fun, light-hearted yet challenging in all the right places.The only problem I've experienced with the game is getting my G27 Logitech Wheel working nicely with it.  People can and do have success, but my wheel has a continuous, strong pull to the left in this game which I cannot resolve.

												My favorite thing about Burnout Paradise is how fast the cars go. Unlike GTAV, where going too fast and crashing means dying and losing $5,000, there is really no penalty for driving at a breakneck speed and ending up in a wreck. The biggest fault of the game isn't the game's fault as much as it is Crtierion's, and that is that they never ported Big Surf Island. ""The Ultimate Box"" doesn't contain every piece of DLC, which is sad. However, the game is still my favorite open-world racing game of all time, and I don't expect that to change anytime soon.

												Burnout Paradise. A good installment for the series without a doubt. Is it as good as Burnout 3 Takedown was ? Obviously not. But that's not fair since Burnout 3 was close to perfect. Is it as good as the others ? Hmmm. Debates will arise.The impression of speed is here, as good as ever. A lot of cars to unlock, drive, each of them handling differently and adpated to different situations, races, goals. A large map, with the diversity you would expect from a good game. Lots of content, collectibles, street records to set... Multiplayer ! A good one ! Still plenty of people to play with, extremely easy to initiate a race while in the world, or just hang around with friends doing stunts and flips.Then why the debates ? In what way is it different from the other installments ? One word : Open world.Yes, open world. Is it a bad open world ? No. Does it create any problems ? Not really. Then why was it not unanimous ? Basically because it's not the usual Burnout formula that we have learned to love and expect. Small issues appear with that formula. The races, as a result, sometimes seem too similar as you'll often take the same paths to get to one part of the map. You can also take a wrong turn with a small misread of the map or after a takedown, and end up losing the race just because going back takes way too long. You also have to know the map like the back of your hand if you want to win any race online. This is pretty much the only issue with the game.It IS a great game. It feels amazing and is a nice addition to the series that attempts new things while keeping the amazing basics every fan loves. It is definitely worth the buy, for any fan of racing games.Play this while we wait for the next one, you won't be disappointed !			",113,19,3,6,5,3,15

												Well, let me start by saying there's nothing Ultimate about this Ultimate Box. EA being the scumbags they are, have shut down the PC store long time ago. So in short at start we don't have the DLC cars and bikes, plus the Big Surf Island update. But worry not, since on PC there is always a way, being the free platform. By googling Vanity pack and ""Unlocking Burnout Paradise DLC"" once can obtain them. Worry not it will not void anything, plus I think it is fair way of dealing with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s from EA.Anyway onto the game.Set in Paradise City, BP is open world carmageddon with various vehicles all of them which resemble well known brands from ""our"" world. This way Criterion have carte blanche to do whatever they want to the cars, including showing you the most twisted and masochist way of wrecking them. Being car in BP ain't easy.We have open world here and nods with different types of races, the usual stuff any Burnout veteran knows: Race, Road Rage and few new like Stunt Run, where you need to jump trough hoops, ramps, edges to bring up the score. The more stylish stunts the more points. Of course the more you play the more you unlock so exploration is rewarded, especially when you can find the various gas stations(boost refill), paint garages (so you can unlock all colors of the car) etc. helpful points of interest.To be hones I was hoping to be something like Revenge and Takedown since I love the track designs there. I've seen all of Paradise and I already miss the alps from Takedown or the Autumn Peak from Revenge. Still Paradise is fun place to be with various stuff and conveniently placed jumping ramps. You have half decent soundtrack but you can always start your trusty mp3 application and spin some tunes if you want.Navigation trough Paradise city is stupid and annoying. You have compass over your head, who most of the times points the right way and god awful mini map which is static and I looked trough the menus and didn't find where I can turn rotation on, since when you are in dynamic races you can mistake your way fairly easy. Yeah sure, the incoming street names blink when you have to make a turn, but try doing that when you jet trough with over 250 km/h(♥♥♥♥ Imperial) trying to do 90 degrees turn. Sometimes it works, sometimes a big♥♥♥♥♥crash occurs with all of the racers. In the end I bough the game for 1.50 euro so no big complains but I sure wouldn't buy it at retail price, especially with EA's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥gery ways pack behind it.A solid 7.5/10, fun game, oh and multiplayer is still alive.TL;DR:+ Same old fast paced mad racing speed+ Awesome car designs + Nice looking graphics+ Not locked on 30fps- EA's doucebagging ways: no way to obtain DLC trough the official store, since it's shut down- Big Surf Island is not in this, so nothing that ""Ultimate"" about it- No crashbreaker, the good old slow - mo where you can control your wrecked car, and score ""Aftertouch"", instead we have some half -♥♥♥♥♥♥♥crash mode you can start at any point when you wreck... No that awesome as in Burnout 3 and Revenge- No really breath taking tracks like Alpines form B3 or Autumn Peak in Revenge- So - so soundtrack - Dumb and annoying navigation- No Crash Events			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Burnout Paradise is a racing/driving game that is best played with friends. Pretty generic, but still extremely fun to play. No real plot, just go around and complete challenges to get your license up. For a game being released in 2007, the graphics are great. It's also best played with a controller. So use one. The PC controls are very bad, and make the game less fun in my opinion.8/10			",135,23,4,5,25,3,10

												A fun smash 'em up type racing game. It's a few years old but it holds up well and has decent graphics. You can have fun no matter what style you prefer: road racing, stunt runs, crashing other cars and avoiding other cars crashing into you are all options. You will have to do at least a few races that are different from your favourite to progress in the game. There are also a bunch of discoverable things and jumps to keep you busy. Sadly the expansion packs aren't available because the Criterion store closed fairly soon after the game was released, although I understand Amazon has it for US customers only. It's a pity because I would really like to try out some of the cars in the expansions. All in all a good and fun game but don't expect any patches or bug fixes in the future.			",108,32,4,16,11,3,16

												I absolutely love this game, Nice open-world experience, fantastic graphics, nice idea on how to unlock new cars and bikes. it's a great game. It's nice to see a game released where you can drive around exploring an open area, some games have that but they're not as fun to explore as Burnout Paradise. if you've played Burnout Revenge, and you remembered all 8 of the maps, this game combines all 8 of those maps from Burnout Revenge into one huge area you can explore. there's only one thing that makes it a little disappointing: there's orchestra music. I'm a huge fan of the burnout series and this is the first burnout game that has orchestra music. That's not burnout, Burnout's music is mainly techno, dance, or rock music. It's not all orchestra music, there is some techno, dance, and rock music in this game,  so it's not all that bad.Graphics: beautiful, this game runs great on my PC, no lag at all, graphics at high-resolution look great, better than on the console.[my PC specs are in my showcase box description]Gameplay: smooth driving mechanic, very fun to drift around curve's and earn points in stunt events. It's nice to see interest points, like a repair shop where you can repair your car, a gas station where you can refill your boost, and places to paint your car even though the paint is selected for you at random. Also, some goals set out in the open world, like short cuts, Burnout Paradise bild boards you can break, and ramps where you can get high air jumps. which is a very cool idea if you're just exploring paradise city you can complete those tasks while your doing it. One thing it does need for the mechanic is a spedometer, that's about it. I'm going to score this game a 9/10, Best open-world racing game I've played yet. I'm a huge fan of the burnout series and I'm very happy that this game to be in the burnout series.			",145,13,5,5,8,2,4

												Even if it's a 2008 game,Burnout Paradise is still a great game to play.A crystal for racing games,this game will totally be worth it's price.Let's see why.GAMEPLAY: Despite lacking a story like the other Burnout games,this game proved to be very fun and addictive to play even without one.The races are extremely fun,especially Road Rage.Watching cars smashing to pieces really makes you want to play Road Rages over,over,and over,and one more thing: OVER,again.Also Marked Man,Stunts and Races.GRAPHICS: Criterion Games worked really well on the graphics,and effects.The graphics are exceptional for a 2008 game.It's very well detailed in my opinion.The effects,oh well.GREAT.Absolutely great.The way your vehicle smashes in another car and starts rolling down the road,losing tires and parts starting to twist and even FALL off,or even when some cars transform into cans when you smash into a wall.Multiplayer: The multiplayer starts from tun to extremely fun when playing with friends.Environment: Paradise City is HUGE.So you have a lot of zones to explore,plus billboards and fences to smash down.My final rating for Burnout Paradise,is 9/10.It's totally,worth it.GO AND BUY IT.Now.

												When people say that Burnout Paradise was a high point in the last generation (as of 2014) of racing games, it's not hyperbole or due to a large amount of cash. It's because it's that good.The gameplay is still extremely fun by today's standards, and so are the graphics. There is just so much to find in the city, be it races, parking garages, Super Jump ramps, drive-throughs and those pesky fences and billboards. Be prepared to spend hours trying to beat your friends' Road Rule scores as well.The motorcycles are certainly a welcome addition to the game, adding a whole new learning experience to the gameplay due to the different manner bikes and cars behave. If only they had released the other DLC on PC or at least bothered keeping the Burnout Store online...If you ever have to limit youself to just one arcade racing game, make it this one.

												Well, let me start by saying there's nothing Ultimate about this Ultimate Box. EA being the scumbags they are, have shut down the PC store long time ago. So in short at start we don't have the DLC cars and bikes, plus the Big Surf Island update. But worry not, since on PC there is always a way, being the free platform. By googling Vanity pack and ""Unlocking Burnout Paradise DLC"" once can obtain them. Worry not it will not void anything, plus I think it is fair way of dealing with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s from EA.Anyway onto the game.Set in Paradise City, BP is open world carmageddon with various vehicles all of them which resemble well known brands from ""our"" world. This way Criterion have carte blanche to do whatever they want to the cars, including showing you the most twisted and masochist way of wrecking them. Being car in BP ain't easy.We have open world here and nods with different types of races, the usual stuff any Burnout veteran knows: Race, Road Rage and few new like Stunt Run, where you need to jump trough hoops, ramps, edges to bring up the score. The more stylish stunts the more points. Of course the more you play the more you unlock so exploration is rewarded, especially when you can find the various gas stations(boost refill), paint garages (so you can unlock all colors of the car) etc. helpful points of interest.To be hones I was hoping to be something like Revenge and Takedown since I love the track designs there. I've seen all of Paradise and I already miss the alps from Takedown or the Autumn Peak from Revenge. Still Paradise is fun place to be with various stuff and conveniently placed jumping ramps. You have half decent soundtrack but you can always start your trusty mp3 application and spin some tunes if you want.Navigation trough Paradise city is stupid and annoying. You have compass over your head, who most of the times points the right way and god awful mini map which is static and I looked trough the menus and didn't find where I can turn rotation on, since when you are in dynamic races you can mistake your way fairly easy. Yeah sure, the incoming street names blink when you have to make a turn, but try doing that when you jet trough with over 250 km/h(♥♥♥♥ Imperial) trying to do 90 degrees turn. Sometimes it works, sometimes a big♥♥♥♥♥crash occurs with all of the racers. In the end I bough the game for 1.50 euro so no big complains but I sure wouldn't buy it at retail price, especially with EA's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥gery ways pack behind it.A solid 7.5/10, fun game, oh and multiplayer is still alive.TL;DR:+ Same old fast paced mad racing speed+ Awesome car designs + Nice looking graphics+ Not locked on 30fps- EA's doucebagging ways: no way to obtain DLC trough the official store, since it's shut down- Big Surf Island is not in this, so nothing that ""Ultimate"" about it- No crashbreaker, the good old slow - mo where you can control your wrecked car, and score ""Aftertouch"", instead we have some half -♥♥♥♥♥♥♥crash mode you can start at any point when you wreck... No that awesome as in Burnout 3 and Revenge- No really breath taking tracks like Alpines form B3 or Autumn Peak in Revenge- So - so soundtrack - Dumb and annoying navigation- No Crash Events			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Burnout Paradise is a racing/driving game that is best played with friends. Pretty generic, but still extremely fun to play. No real plot, just go around and complete challenges to get your license up. For a game being released in 2007, the graphics are great. It's also best played with a controller. So use one. The PC controls are very bad, and make the game less fun in my opinion.8/10			",135,23,4,5,25,3,10

												It's an amazingly good racing game, horribly marred by EA's terrible choices regarding DLC.A third of the console versions' DLC is included in the ""Ultimate Box"" version.A third of the console versions' DLC was never brought to PC at all, including a whole new island full of challenges and things to do, which is a pretty significant chunk of game.And a third of the DLC is in the game, but locked until you buy it from the in-game shop wityh real money. But EA shut the shop down only a few months after release. So despite those bits of DLC being in the game, you can never unlock them (through any legitimate means) because EA won't even sell them to you anymore.I still recommend it, with reservations, but I recommend the console versions even more if they're an option. Or you can just stay away and not encourage EA to behave like this, but they're not going to notice or care anyway, so... your call there.			",2439,766,93,291,276,30,350

												video game (feat. video & aggro lavine's boyfrend song)good physics but hard to appreciate. they stuck with the idea of never teleporting the player so objectives are generally easy enough to not need to retry. a LOT of time will be spent watching cars crash into things in ultra-slowmo. can't turn it off even though multiplayer disables it.the map is nicely designed but the graphics dont do it any favors. even important parts of the road blend into the unsaturated scenery. there's a few hundred things to jump and crash into for completionists. the whole area is unlocked from the start and never changes so it does get stale.progression feels slow and repetitive: complete # objectives, reset map with slightly more difficult AI, rinse and repeat. unlocking cars is the main reason to continue; they're decently varied and each with an upgraded version to get.dont forget the EA-mandatory condescending announcer guy telling you how to press a button, and unskippable opening logos. also audio options dont take effect until you gain control of your car so i hope you like ACDC's viridian city blaring each time you open it.it's a game with a lot of wasted potential but i found myself pouring hours into it anyway so idk who even reads these things im gayps. dont play online with a webcam plugged in			",103,19,3,6,5,1,10

												**REVIEW CHANGED FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE** - See Edit for detailsI'm torn. Giving this a negative review is something that hurts me a lot, because I really love this game and I have done for years. I get annoyed when people start their reviews like this, but hear me out. This game is fantastic. I first played it back when it first came out on the old 360, and it was a blast to pick up and play with my friends. The game is great and I had unlocked every car in the game. The driving is more than solid, and holds up well today. Got a great soundtrack, a lot of cars and an interesting world to play around in.So why the negative review for the PC version? In fact, the negative review isn't for the game itself, it's because the DLC is not available on PC any more, at least on the Steam version. This is a huge shame because the DLC has some of my favourite parts of the game, especially the toy cars pack and, in this case, the time savers pack. Of course, if this doesn't bother you, please disregard the negativity. It's a very good game, especially so with friends. If you don't want the DLC then consider this review a shining endorsement! I LOVE this game! But if you want my advice? Just don't get the Steam version. Get it on Origin instead as you can at least get the bonus vehicle DLC pack.Edit: This review wasn't really clear when I first wrote it, so I'm making some quick corrections. The game is good, don't get me wrong. I guess the biggest contributor to the issue is that the game just doesn't have any support on Steam any more, hence why I suggested getting the game on Origin instead as some DLC is still available. I am aware Criterion have moved on from this and aren't supporing it any more at all, but I don't expect them to continue supporting a game this old anyway. I've changed the review to a positive one after realising my mistakes (thanks for bringing me up on it, Illimitus). The game is great, I really want to sing it's praises, but if you want the DLC Steam isn't the place to do it. If you want a good game without DLC, this is absolutely worth a purchase. Apologies for a misleading negative review, any future reviews will not be made just before going to bed on a late night :)			",95,1,2,10,5,0,3

												A fun smash 'em up type racing game. It's a few years old but it holds up well and has decent graphics. You can have fun no matter what style you prefer: road racing, stunt runs, crashing other cars and avoiding other cars crashing into you are all options. You will have to do at least a few races that are different from your favourite to progress in the game. There are also a bunch of discoverable things and jumps to keep you busy. Sadly the expansion packs aren't available because the Criterion store closed fairly soon after the game was released, although I understand Amazon has it for US customers only. It's a pity because I would really like to try out some of the cars in the expansions. All in all a good and fun game but don't expect any patches or bug fixes in the future.			",108,32,4,16,11,3,16

												After playing this for three hours I could not breathe, talk, or even form coherent thoughts. Thats how much I laughed. Very entertaining, and for a game almost 6 years old, DEFINITELY worth it. It hits the right mix of arcade and simulation to make a world where every crash is stunningly beautiful. The one downside is that DLC is no longer purchasable, so half of the ""complete"" game is missing, even though the code is In Game already. 9/10			",531,89,21,57,59,8,98

												This is one of if not the best racing game that I have ever played! Almost everything is spot on, and there are very few annoyances. The graphics, gameplay, music, and the design of paradise city are fantastic! the city, the cars, and everything else are very well detailed. The gameplay is tight, esponsive, and the controls feel perfect for this game (if you're using a controller). Almost all of the music fits very well into the world and atmosphere that Criterion has made, but I can't say that the music is great (I think it is) because that's all up to youand your personal taste. And Paradise City is a very well crafted open world that is a ton of fun to explore full of seceret areas and shortcuts that help you win challenges! the only major negative that I have is that you sometimes feel like you cant avoid a crash. Mainly because you sometimes cant see a car, wall, pillar, ect coming until it's too late. That can get pretty annoying, but it doesn't happen all that much. Overall, Burnout Paradise is a very well crafted skill based racer that doesn't hold your hand, but never feels very unfair with great physics, world design, controlls, fitting music, and graphics. I deffinatley reccomend this game to all who want to try it, or are even just slightly interested in it!			",49,3,4,3,3,0,1

												The best 10 bucks (50% Sale) I have ever spent. While it may only say around 100 hours on my account, I have spent at least double this on offline mode and am just blown away by this game.PROS: - Great physics (apart from poles, boost and barrel rolls) - Massive open world that takes ages to fully explore - Super jumps, billboards, smash gates & street times to find and beat - Absolutely unbeatable graphics (including time of day) for a car-racing game - Change of environment from downtown, to harbour, to beachfront and lakefront to mountainous countrysideCONS: - Online play seriously flawed - ""Driveaways""impede race flow - Occasionally Windows 8.1 Computer freezes upon tabbing in (about 1 in 5 chance)Overall though this is a fantastic game in which the pros greatly outweigh the cons and I give it a rating of 9.5/10 flying, crashing and speeding cars through a massive city.

												Just like that, Criterion has really changed the way you’ll look at the structure of racing games. While other racers have tried open worlds (Test Drive Unlimited, for instance), there have been none that have offered the same sense of freedom, ease of use, and level of polish. Criterion has finally taken off your training wheels, and after playing Burnout Paradise, there's little doubt that you'll never want them back on. 9/11			",39,2,2,0,5,0,5

												This is a mixed review, I like the Burnout series a lot, and this one is very good, but the fact that is named ""The Ultimate Box"" is what doesn´t check.The denominative Ultimate Box is just bait so you think you are gaining all the content from the Console version, but that´s not gonna happen, the content given was a free update in Console versions (Day-Night cycle, the Bikes, the weather) and the things you would expect (The Legendary Cars, the Toy Cars, the extra cities) are nowhere to be seen, not even as a DLC purchase.Don´t get me wrong, the game is good for those who love a non realistic racing game, and for people like myself who are more fighters than drivers, with a lot of events in every intersection...if you drive a car, if you drive a bike the only thing you get is Burning Route or Burning Route, no more.To call this ""ultimate"" is a joke, but if you see this game on a sale and like arcade style racing games, you´ll feel that the purchase was good, otherwise, just pass without seeing.

												I originally played the console version of this, but I love it so much that I own it on Steam too. From the soundtrack to the world design, the feeling of the cars themselves to the game modes, no other racing game has been able to match the personal enjoyment I've gotten out of this one. Coming back to it is like meeting an old friend and playing Hot Wheels together for hours -- you feel like a kid again, because the part of you that loves seeing cars go really fast and smash into each other is awoken from its dormant state.Seven years on, it is still my favorite racing game and one of my favorite games in general. Highly, highly recommended.			",52,10,1,3,2,0,1

												Summary: There's lots of stuff to do. If you like racing games, you'll like this one. It's non-stop addictive. One of EA's last good games.After picking it up with the EA Humble Bundle last year, I couldn't stop. There was just so much to do. You start smashing fences for a while and suddenly, a billboard comes into your vision. That billboard's going down. Get some air, bam, full boost, billboard down. So you boost around the city, smashing more fences, looking for those sick blue cone jumps, and soon you unlock some sort of trophy-award type thing. What is this? Searching through the arguably worst menu in history, I find the list of awards. The award you just got is about smashing something like 200 or 300 fences, and you discover that there are more awards! Some for jumps, some for takedowns, some for online things which EA really sucks at, and BILLBOARDS. You look around the map for billboards. Some you can't reach, and you have to figure a way to get to it. After defeating the evil red billboards, beat up all the yellow fences, you come home victorious to the junk yard.Then you start your first race.			",89,15,16,7,22,2,8

												Even though Burnout Paradise has been around for over 6 years, it still holds it's own as one of the best racing games in the 360/PS3 generation and beyond. The open world environment mixed with the franchise's classic, chaotic crash system makes for some brilliant fun. The graphics, whilst obviously not flashy by today's standards, still look nice and pretty, plus the smooth framerate than never drops below 60 (on my pc at least) make for some easily enjoyable gaming.There's still multiplayer available, and often when I'm hosting a session with some friends, we get quite a few random players joining the fun.Overall, a great racing game, if you love cars, this is one for you.

The part where it told me that everything I do is my choice and then turned around and told me what to do literally moved me to tears. I've already sunk three hours of gameplay into it and that was just figuring out the ""unique"" control scheme! A must buy!			",76,2,4,1,5,0,10

												I'd say that, for a PC Racing Game, this is pretty good... but not perfect.For the good, i will say the controls work pretty well with both Keyboard and Gamepad. Of course, the gamepad works a bit better, but it's one of the few PC racing games i can say i'd actually play with the keyboard.Secondly, the open world is fantastic. It's really large, open to exploration, and just damn fun to drive around in. And finally, all the cars feel unique. Even the clones of the same car, such as the Customs, still feel really good, even different compared to the regular version.But it does have some problems.Not gonna complain about the dlc, but what i will complain about, is the CRASHING. I don't mean Car Crashing, i mean the Game Crashing. It happens randomly, and there are no signs it is going to happen, just one second you're happily driving along, the next, the game crashes. And it happens ALL THE DAMN TIME.Secondly, while it looks great, there are some texture quality problems at times. That's all i'll say about it.I personally can say that i have enjoyed this game quite a good bit, but it's not without faults. I'd reccommend buying it if you have the spare money.

												Blast from the past.I remember having this on PS2 and I couldn't stand it, I purchased burnout paradise expecing modes such as crash and being able to setup split screen games for races and takedowns and was rather guttered with the new mechanics of this game.This, however, was a long time ago and I picked this up on offer to give it another go and my god I was missing out. Although its rather old now, the graphics are not all that bad and it plays really well at 5760X1080 and I spent a night racing through it and enjoyed every minute of it. I havn't played alot of this game as I bought alot during the last steam sale but once I have an urge for a racing game I will be coming back to this to complete it, great game and strongly recomend purcashing this on a sale.

												If you like speeding through cities, dodge traffic and ram your opponents into walls (or the aforementioned traffic), then this game is for you.Featuring an open city, a variety of cars and events, a so-so soundtrack and the never ending joy of bashing opponents to smithereens, Burnout Paradise offers arcade racing fans a treat.If you want to crash into some human enemies, go online and partake in pretty much everything you did in singleplayer!What I'm enjoying most online, though, are the co-op events, where the players unite (more or less) to achieve a common goal, like managing to get to a certain place or do barrel rolls over each other.It's a bit sad that Paradise may be the first and last Burnout making it to PC, as Criterion (and especially EA) seems more focused on Need for Speed. What's also sad is that one of the bigger DLCs never made it to PC: Big Surf Island, which not only includes a whole new are to explore, but also new game modes and cars.But rejoice as modders try to bring exactly that to the PC! It's already playable, although it's still missing a lot of stuff, including singleplayer events, traffic and game modes, but you can explore Big Surf Island, drive a lot of new cars (including whatever cruises through Paradise) and partake in online events!It's called the ""Vanity Pack"". Go and get it. Seriously.And while we're at DLC: The in-game store has been shut down a long time ago, but you can still get the Legendary Cars, Toy Cars and the Boost Specials from retailers like Amazon.All in all a fantastic game. Get it! ",753,197,23,67,50,8,69

												Awesome open-world driving/racing game.  The same developer as NFS: HP, MW and Rivals.  You can challenge your driving skills in Paradise City with lots of different kinds of cars, even bikes!  6 different boost systems give you lots of fun.  If you like free roaming in open world and racing game, you should try Burnout Paradise.讚讚的開放世界賽車遊戲，與極速快感: 超熱力追緝、新全民公敵、生存競速的開發商是同一個，你可以載天堂市挑戰你的駕駛技術，不但有各種車子還有機車！六種不同的加速系統非常有趣，如果你喜歡在開放世界晃晃、又喜歡賽車遊戲，那你一定要試試看Burnout Paradise。			",421,58,16,45,46,2,59

												I fell out of driving games for a number of years, but this one looked like too much fun to pass up. And now I'm hooked on them again! This game is so much fun, I almost feel guilty. I'm trying to squeeze a race or a Road Rage session into every spare moment I get. The soundtrack can get a little monotonous after a while if you're not careful, but the gameplay, graphics, sound, car unlocking, achievements, free exploration... it's all just a ton of FUN. I highly recommend this one if you like cars and driving games. I use an XBox 360 Controller on my PC for this one, and it works WONDERFULLY for it. GET IT!			",713,286,63,134,151,8,163

												I almost never replay games. I’m too busy and handsome. I’m on my fourth go through with BP. Take some element's from the Need For Speed series and combine them with the distruction of the best Burnout games and this is what you get. It’s madly splendid, letting you smash through, jump over, and race down for ever and ever and ever. Although if I ever hear Paradise City again I might blow up the Earth.			",695,78,29,62,87,9,129

												This game is amazing and if you have a gamepad you'll love it even more. You're a driver in Paradise City and by completing challenges you're rewarded with new or upgraded cars as well as an upgraded driver's license. You'll find yourself spending a lot of time on the singleplayer if you buy this game. The multiplayer is also amazing. It allows you to drive freely around the entire map with friends , place new road rules (records), bash your friend's car untill its wrecked or just drive and relax.			",614,173,19,58,66,8,80

												DISCLAIMER!!!!!!! This DOES NOT include any DLC despite what the title says.I have been a huge fan of the entire Burnout series from day one it is an amazing arcade style game with a ton of different races and modes.Burnout Paradise is by far the most different of them all, think of it as Need for Speed (Carbon/Most wanted) and Burnout had a baby this is that baby unlike other Burnout games when you finish a race the game doesnt go back to any menus or anything it puts ou back into an open world where you can drive around doing whatever you want until you decide to race again which i always loved in the Need for Speed games that had it.But like I said this is not the ultimate box so if you are buying it expecting DLC then just stay away but it is the base Burnout Paradise game which is an amazing game by itself idk if the online modes work or not I dont mess with those but the party play is fun if you have friends over and want to play each other.The soundtrack like all other burnout games is awesome and the world and cars are beautiful this one really shows the damage done to your car better than ever before and the slow motion crash cam is great.I recomend it if you are ok with not having the DLC I suggest getting it on sale though but thats a given with any and all games to me.

												I love that the open-world aspect allows for multiple routes when racing, however I hate how long it takes to get to another race. When you've almost completed the game, you might be driving for a while just to get to the next match. The plethora of customization and cars makes it worth the minor irritants.			",16,9,1,5,3,0,3

												Yeah, it was made 5 years ago.So what?Graphics are still amazing.This is the single best open world driving game I've ever played!Online multiplayer so you can drive around with your friends and smash each other to bits.If I had found out about this earlier, I would have thought it'd be too good to be true!The open world is so good that the only reason I do missions anymore is when A) I want to change things up a bit, or B) I want to unlock more cars.There are tons of different cars, and playstyles, if you want to be a super fast formula car, or just an unstoppable wall that noone can hit without being taken out. Or maybe you want to be a sports car, with enough speed to keep your car out of trouble while still looking fantastic.The music is awesome. Just the kinds of things you want to listen to when smashing your way through downtown Paradise.Definitely the best racing game I've ever played!			",166,58,3,26,34,2,21

												This is the racer I come back to again and again and again. It's endlessly enjoyable, the dificulty curved nicely for people who don't play racers.  Expect arcade style physics and fun first.  Excellent XBox controller integration with D-Pad online options.  This racer looks great on older PCs and machines with very modest or even no dedicated video card.  Downsides: you gotta have your EA login handy, and you might get a wee bit tired of the title GNR song.			",196,27,3,5,6,1,14

The online challenges requires a lot of teamwork but if you are playing with the right players, you'll achieve them fast.The soundtracks are pretty epic as, the city looks visually amazing.Too bad this game never got the Cops N' Robbers and Secret Island DLC's for PC.If you want to go to Paradise City, then pick this game as fast as you can. :DMy Rating: 9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a good racing game.But instead of just racing, you can also take down your enemies, easily the thing that sets the game series Burnout apart from others. And it's very fun. Another unusual thing is that, while you're racing (or are playing the other modes), there are no arrows to guide you, no boundries. You must rely on your mini-map and / or compass to get to the finishing line. The game has a massive open world with over four hundred shortcuts that you can learn in order to get to the finishing line quicker than the others can. There are also some other ""collectibles"". You also find events (Racing, Marked Man, Road Rage...) only by exploring the map. The main goal of the game is to get a Burnout Driving License, which you can only get by winning the aforementioned events. You get cars every time you upgrade your license, and when you shut down certain cars.The game also has an online mode, where you can play the same events that you can on singleplayer, but with actual people. Sadly, Race is the only properly made event, as the other ones really haven't had much love given to them. When you're not doing an event in multiplayer, you're on freeburn, where you try beating other people's records (no. of barrel rolls, air distance, etc.). It's quite fun, even if it has its flaws.Now, let's talk about the port: it's bad. The online mode doesn't even have a chat. You can only communicate with other people with voice chat. The menus are really odd too. The optimization is alright. I do have some FPS drops in areas with lots of cars and action, but you can kinda blame it on my PC (although I expected it to perform a bit better regardless). The fast menu is also impossible to access unless you have a controller, which is a problem because that's the menu that allows you to change teams in certain multiplayer events such as Road Rage.Overall, it's a good game. And it's cheap. You don't really need a controller, the keyboard works just fine. It has its flaws, but overall you should get it if you're a fan of racing. 8/10 ",64,2,5,2,3,0,2

												This game is getting older as we speak. The game is a classic and is really the best Burnout game in the series, I love this game personally and can play it for hours with its multiple missions and many different cars. The cars in this game... Well I love them really, starting the cars driving them at high speeds through the city and the hills. There are many DLCs ,which you know I hate, but there is a definate way to bypass that. The cars are all interesting and really fun to drive, the handling is very easy and you can definatley feel the freedom when you're driving.Firstly the cars in this are awesome! You can get many styles of cars such as: Rage, stunt, street and that wierd turbo thing that only lets you recharge... The entire car system has many different styles of driving, the cars can be stock or the upgraded unlocked version of the original car. You can get mini cars, police cars and many more random types of new cars which can only be found on the origin store. The DLC for paradise island is only avalible for the console versions of this game but you can mod it into the game which adds buggys and a whole new island. The entire games map is massive compared to new games and its nicley detailed, the whole thing has events placed ""at every intersection"" as explained in the first part of the game which is true! Events on every intersection which can be played again but only to beat your score.The map concludes of beaches, mountains and city scapes with loads of driving to do. I had some technical problems with the game trying to set up multiplayer, EA actually sent me a copy onto my Origin account which then worked. The games multiplayer consists of free drive, races, stunt runs and free races (which is where you set up your own races for your friends). I like playing with my friends because you can have a lot of fun seeing who can get the biggest air alltogether in a certain place or just driving for fun. Multiplayer does have a negative side to it though, its very anoying to setup with multiple game platforms Steam/Origin but I was the only one with this problem.The game does have DLC but noone wants to pay for that so some nice modding community have recreated Paradise Island from the Xbox and Playstation games, the mod also allows you to change cars at random points and adds all of the DLC without EA coming to rip your wallet apart. The DLC is quite fun and you can have lots of random moments with your friends. The mod also allows you to change to any citizen car with any paint scheme which is a nice feature.Only problems that I had. On a Windows 7 Computer it worked fine for a series of time, it would crash ocasionally but that might of been because of my older setup. The game works well with old and new Windows but I had some problems with a Win10 machine, but my friends computer (WIN8) worked fine. I was trying to get the game running with two monitors but then I realised I my older setup was screen center to left which for some reason broke burnout completley but when I disconnected it, the game ran smoothly.You can have hours of fun on any burnout game but especially this one with its free world and ability to choose to do missions when you want to. So I recommend buying this, but remember to play it with friends because it is extremely fun messing around with some areas!			",146,25,18,15,30,1,14

												This game is just absolutely positively amazing. This game is great for when you want to play a free roam racing game. This game is fantastic when you have friends to drive around, crash into, and even chase. I recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a nice car game, it's really entertaining. It's a bit sellout due to the last cars you can't get through gameplay, but you gotta buy them. Also the monitor option, to split it into 1, 2 or 3 monitors only applies for the monitor the game is running in.			",136,27,4,20,19,1,30

												If you are obsessed with demolition derby I tell you, THIS IS THE PERFECT GAME FOR YOU! from the quality of graphics to gameplay you will be amazed, especially if you got this game 75% off. I have 3 recommendations though, firstly, they should make the game easier for newcomers. it took me a while to figure out how to enter different types of races and how to find myself around paradise city. Secondly, 95% of the songs in this game are written by mozart. Please get better music. Lastly, please make it easier to access the settings in the game. it took me half an hour to figure out how to change my controls and it took me even longer to exit the game. But these are very minor issues and i definetely think you should give this game a chance, especially if this game is on sale at the price of a TF2 key!			",50,0,4,2,8,0,0

												So I have played alot of burnout on the first Xbox (not sure which version anymore) and had loads of fun playing it.That's why when I saw this game on sale for only €2,50 I instantly bought it.Pros- You're free to do what you want.- The music in the game is really good and if you don't like a song you can easily skip it.- Easy to learn.- Alot of different things to do.Cons- I don't really like the new crash system (called showtime in this game).- No windowed option in the game.- You need to login to a EA account (you can play offline without).- I have 7 hours in this game and until now I find it a bit too easy.Overall I really like this game and it was well worth my money, and I would recommend this to other people,Rating: 8/10			",58,10,2,1,8,0,4

												Completed this game twice on PlayStation 3, spent lots of hours online, set thousand of records, and I still can't seem to get enough of it. Purchased it again just because this is really one of the best racing games. Graphics looks more dates than I remember it, although now I can play it in 3D! But the speed, the adrenaline, the sheer fun and the superb soundtrack are still there. God I missed DJ Atomica. Amazing place where the grass is green and the girls are pretty, won't you just take me home. For this price the game is an absolute must-buy. Also still one of the best car destructions. And the best car weight feeling ever.			",131,8,1,12,2,0,7

												Excellent game.  If this exact same game was made today it would be a 10 or 20 GB download, but since it was made back when programmers knew how to program code right, it's only a 2.9 GB Download and looks as good or better than current day racing games.  Open world and racing is extremely fun.  Have windows 7 x64 system, and did not have to do anything special to get it to run on my system.Only negative thing about game is what they left out, no Crash Mode.			",163,10,2,26,5,1,4

												In Paradise City, there was a box. Nobody knew what was is in it, nobody was ever able to open it. It had strange letters etched into it, letters which kept the mystery surrounding this box, nicknamed the ""Ultimate Box"", going for years. What are these letters, you may ask? DLC.In February 5th of 2009, humanity discovered a way to open this box. Simply by inserting money from your wallet or credit card into it's keyhole, for the first time people were able to do something nobody could ever do before; Play Burnout Paradise on the PC. With motorcycles. Following these events, video game megacorporation Electronic Arts claimed ownership of the Ultimate Box and began monopolizing it. However, if you are content with giving your money to the military industrial complex, take out your credit card and get ready to do something absolutely mind-bending. Get ready to play a pretty fun open-world driving game on your very own personal computational device. In 2400p. 120fps. Twin Titan Blacks SLI. Overclocked Pentium 3. Anime mods optional.

												I think in raw fun factor, this one is in my top spot for racing games. Burnout's physics are tuned for bumping and crashing and the game does everything it can to encourage this so it can show off its very impressive car deformation system. This isn't a realistic racing sim. But it is a totally bad♥♥♥♥♥ visually stunning crashing sim.The multiplayer is quite fun if you have a good host. The game world is one huge sandbox map. The host picks from any of the single player modes, and a large variety of specific stunt missions.This is an obvious console port, but aside from the awkward menu system and defaulting the microphone to on (as many console ports do), it plays great on the PC (as long as you have a controller).A word of warning: if you don't have a good sense of navigation, you may find it a bit difficult to choose the optimal paths for a given race, especially if you're ahead of the pack, because the game does not do a very good job helping you out in this respect.

The online challenges requires a lot of teamwork but if you are playing with the right players, you'll achieve them fast.The soundtracks are pretty epic as, the city looks visually amazing.Too bad this game never got the Cops N' Robbers and Secret Island DLC's for PC.If you want to go to Paradise City, then pick this game as fast as you can. :DMy Rating: 9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the racer I come back to again and again and again. It's endlessly enjoyable, the dificulty curved nicely for people who don't play racers.  Expect arcade style physics and fun first.  Excellent XBox controller integration with D-Pad online options.  This racer looks great on older PCs and machines with very modest or even no dedicated video card.  Downsides: you gotta have your EA login handy, and you might get a wee bit tired of the title GNR song.			",196,27,3,5,6,1,14

												This is a good racing game.But instead of just racing, you can also take down your enemies, easily the thing that sets the game series Burnout apart from others. And it's very fun. Another unusual thing is that, while you're racing (or are playing the other modes), there are no arrows to guide you, no boundries. You must rely on your mini-map and / or compass to get to the finishing line. The game has a massive open world with over four hundred shortcuts that you can learn in order to get to the finishing line quicker than the others can. There are also some other ""collectibles"". You also find events (Racing, Marked Man, Road Rage...) only by exploring the map. The main goal of the game is to get a Burnout Driving License, which you can only get by winning the aforementioned events. You get cars every time you upgrade your license, and when you shut down certain cars.The game also has an online mode, where you can play the same events that you can on singleplayer, but with actual people. Sadly, Race is the only properly made event, as the other ones really haven't had much love given to them. When you're not doing an event in multiplayer, you're on freeburn, where you try beating other people's records (no. of barrel rolls, air distance, etc.). It's quite fun, even if it has its flaws.Now, let's talk about the port: it's bad. The online mode doesn't even have a chat. You can only communicate with other people with voice chat. The menus are really odd too. The optimization is alright. I do have some FPS drops in areas with lots of cars and action, but you can kinda blame it on my PC (although I expected it to perform a bit better regardless). The fast menu is also impossible to access unless you have a controller, which is a problem because that's the menu that allows you to change teams in certain multiplayer events such as Road Rage.Overall, it's a good game. And it's cheap. You don't really need a controller, the keyboard works just fine. It has its flaws, but overall you should get it if you're a fan of racing. 8/10 ",64,2,5,2,3,0,2

												Burnout Paradise gives a real feeling of freedom!!!!You can drive everywhere in Paradise City and smash billboards.You can unlock cool cars and customise the way you want.The race modes are getting really challenging when you work you way up.The way you unlock cars is really unique you need to find the cars in Paradise City and to unlock them you need to wreck that specific car.

												I'd say this game is closer to being a Tony Hawk-style ""stunt game"" than it is to being a racing game. Sure, there are races, but there are also challenges based on doing sick flips off of broken parts of bridges as well as ones based on seeing if your car can beat up the other cars. The world that the game takes place in is also very nice; they basically mashed a bunch of cities and settings together into one city specifically designed for racing (though sometimes it's eerie how despite it being a large city, there are 0 pedestrians or otherwise any signs of life apart from empty, self-driving cars), and it works great. And despite this game being relatively old, it still looks great, and the great news is that it still works! Several other old games are unplayable now because of DRM-related issues, and this game is not one of those games (though ""DLC Island"" is extinct now)This game has a few flaws though. If you're a ""purist"", this game might upset you since everything feels very arcade-y (for me this was a plus though). Second, some stuff like the aforementioned ""DLC Island"" is no longer accessible (at least as far as I know) due to DRM shenanigans, so if you're one of those people who boycotts games that suffered from DRM, this might be bad news for you, though having said that the game works fine even with DRM shooting it in the foot slightly (and hey, if you were expecting any better from EA, then... yeah). The in-game announcer DJ Atomika is also annoying, but it's not anything that would completely ruin a game IMO.Overall, I'd say this game is a good buy. I got it in a Humble Bundle many years ago, and it has ended up becoming my all-time favorite racing game, so there's that. (also sorry in advance if this review reads weird, I was a bit tired when I wrote it)			",52,3,2,8,6,1,11

												Overall Review: ""The Ultimate Box"" isn't really that ""Ultimate""you are unable to get any of the dlc. not even big surf, toys or anything. you get a few extra races and thats about it. DO NOT BUY THE £4.99 ON HERE.go on {LINK REMOVED} and you can get it half the price. its not worth paying £5 when you dont get the benefits from it that you were expecting.Game Review:NOSTALGIC. started playing this as my first game on ps3 and loved to play this game again! the action packed races to the adrenaline rushed free roam. you will be hooked in seconds. pretty good graphics for the game it is bearing in mind it is fairly old now! I play this game in the max settings and it is an absolute blast to play with. really brings the game to life.OVERALL RATING 7/10 (lost 3 due to not being able to have dlc, apart from that the game is AWESOME!!!)

												This game is getting older as we speak. The game is a classic and is really the best Burnout game in the series, I love this game personally and can play it for hours with its multiple missions and many different cars. The cars in this game... Well I love them really, starting the cars driving them at high speeds through the city and the hills. There are many DLCs ,which you know I hate, but there is a definate way to bypass that. The cars are all interesting and really fun to drive, the handling is very easy and you can definatley feel the freedom when you're driving.Firstly the cars in this are awesome! You can get many styles of cars such as: Rage, stunt, street and that wierd turbo thing that only lets you recharge... The entire car system has many different styles of driving, the cars can be stock or the upgraded unlocked version of the original car. You can get mini cars, police cars and many more random types of new cars which can only be found on the origin store. The DLC for paradise island is only avalible for the console versions of this game but you can mod it into the game which adds buggys and a whole new island. The entire games map is massive compared to new games and its nicley detailed, the whole thing has events placed ""at every intersection"" as explained in the first part of the game which is true! Events on every intersection which can be played again but only to beat your score.The map concludes of beaches, mountains and city scapes with loads of driving to do. I had some technical problems with the game trying to set up multiplayer, EA actually sent me a copy onto my Origin account which then worked. The games multiplayer consists of free drive, races, stunt runs and free races (which is where you set up your own races for your friends). I like playing with my friends because you can have a lot of fun seeing who can get the biggest air alltogether in a certain place or just driving for fun. Multiplayer does have a negative side to it though, its very anoying to setup with multiple game platforms Steam/Origin but I was the only one with this problem.The game does have DLC but noone wants to pay for that so some nice modding community have recreated Paradise Island from the Xbox and Playstation games, the mod also allows you to change cars at random points and adds all of the DLC without EA coming to rip your wallet apart. The DLC is quite fun and you can have lots of random moments with your friends. The mod also allows you to change to any citizen car with any paint scheme which is a nice feature.Only problems that I had. On a Windows 7 Computer it worked fine for a series of time, it would crash ocasionally but that might of been because of my older setup. The game works well with old and new Windows but I had some problems with a Win10 machine, but my friends computer (WIN8) worked fine. I was trying to get the game running with two monitors but then I realised I my older setup was screen center to left which for some reason broke burnout completley but when I disconnected it, the game ran smoothly.You can have hours of fun on any burnout game but especially this one with its free world and ability to choose to do missions when you want to. So I recommend buying this, but remember to play it with friends because it is extremely fun messing around with some areas!			",146,25,18,15,30,1,14

												At first, this game sucks when you first download it because it only comes with a few of the DLC and none of which are the good ones. If you buy this, keep in mind that PC version doesn't have Big Surf Island or Cops and Robbers and doesn't initially include all the DLC. If you want the Boost Cars, Legendary Cars, and Toy Cars, you will have to spend an extra $10 on Amazon to purchase them and then redeem them through Origin. I would reccommend this game to anyone, it's my favorite car themed game in general! Just keep in mind that EA will still try to screw you since it's EA. If you want the DLC with the game then heres what you do:1. Buy the game on Steam2. Buy the DLC from Amazon3. Use the DLC Key Code on Origin4. Log into Burnout Paradise on your EA account and it should be thereI hope this helps because it made me very frustrated to think there was no DLC and no multiplayer, but there is both.

WARNING!!! I'll be comparing this game to ""Burnout Revenge""; it's predecessor.This is the last entry of the main Burnout series, and I feel that it is a strong game, it is really fun to play. But compared to the previous game... it fell short for me. Lemme explain:I used to play Burnout Revenge on my PS2 and I had a blast playing through it, I haven't played it in over 2 years but there are a lot of things missing in Paradise.1. Traffic Checking Sure in this game you can get ""Traffick Check Takedown"" which is crashing into a traffic car, causing it to lose control and crashing into an oponent... BUT in Revenge if you crashed into the back of a traffic car you could just launch it into oblivion (and possible other racers), in fact, traffic checking was actually a whole game mode in Revenge, where you had to crash into as many cars as possible before you ran out of time, by chaining them and throwing them into Trucks and Busses and oncoming traffic for bonus time and points.In Paradise you can't do it... which I learned the hard way...2. Crash Events Yes you can trigger a crash event by pressing LB+RB on your Xbox controller (not sure on keyboard) but they only serve as a ""record"" on the different roads of the game... in Revenge they were MASSIVE, you had to launch your car into a heavily transited intersection; you could unlock heavy cars for those events specifically, If you have played ""Turbo Dismount"" then you'll know how those worked on Revenge, except that once you did enough damage your boost meter would feel and you'd have to mash the boost button to BLOW UP and causing even more damage to other cars and even reach cars that were too far away from you. Beating those events would unlock more ranks, events and cars.3. Burnout TakedownsYou can't do these in Paradise... In Revenge (after you unlock the ability of course), when you crashed in a Road Rage or Race event you could press a button (Don't remember which one) and blow up, taking other racers with you, racking up your score in Road Rage, or diminish your dissadvantage after crashing.4. Double, Triple and more takedownsIn Paradise if you manage to force 2 or more racers into a wall and they all crash, you only get credit for one of those; in Revenge if you do that it would show you the first crash and say ""TAKEDOWN!"" and immediately shift to the other crashed car and say ""Double Takedown"" and even if you don't get the camera for the takedowns you still got credit for those... making Road Rage events a lot more satisfying to beat.5. AFTERTOUCHAftertouch is an ability in most Burnout games (At least on Burnout 3, Revenge, and Dominator) where if you crash into a wall or traffic car, you could slow down time and move your car in the air, this means you can place yourself in front of oponents for them to crash into you... AND IT COUNTS AS TAKEDOWNS, which meant that if you made a mistake you could take the competition with you!Unfortunately you can't use aftertouch in Paradise, If you crash you can actually spin if the front wheels are touching the ground... but even if you manage to position yourself in front of someone, it won't count as a takedown... sure it makes them crash and lose their advantage... but it feels a lot more satisfying to read ""AFTERTOUCH TAKEDOWN"" and even adding a DOUBLE or TRIPLE if you cause 2 or 3 oponents to crash into you. This also means that on Road Rage events you won't get credit for doing that.6. More CarsI like how you unlock cars by smashing them into a wall in Paradise. However in Revenge you were constantly unlocking new cars by getting medals in all of the events, however in Paradise it feels more of a chore to unlock them instead of a rewards...In fact I ALT+F4 out of the game multiple times because I couldn't reach the car I had to unlock and when I finally got close, I do a curve wrong or crash into traffic and completely lose the damn car... Also in Revenge there was a list of objectives in every location (I think there were 9 locations... not sure on that one) and they were pretty much the same, but they were really difficult to beat, The ones I remember the best are: Get a vertical takedown Win a clean race (No crashes) Beat X event in Y ammount of timeThere were more but those are the ones I remember and what do you get for beating all of the objectives?ONE OF THE BEST CARS IN THE GAMEIt was rewarding to beat them.7. Signature TakedownsI think even RIvals for the Nintendo DS had signature takedowns... if you crashed an oponent in a specific spot on an event you'll get multiple angles of the crash and ""pictures"" AND you'll unlock the signature takedown (actually quite useless but it still feels satisfying to know that you did it.)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now that I'm done comparing this one with Revenge I'll express my opinion on the new features the game has.1. Open WorldMeh... to be honest Burnout doesn't need an open world, it has always been about the events and races, but physically reaching each event doesn't really fit with the pace of this game.2. Stunt RunsThey're really fun, I like just jumping all over the place, drifting and finding shortcuts and stunt jumps on the way, And crashing against something finishing your combo feels fait, you crash? start the combo again.3. Time TrialsI don't like how you always have to change cars for these events, you know a little pop-up saying ""would you like to change your car?"" would be nice for these events, as junk yards are often far away and sometimes I forget which car was I supposed to get into... Although unlocking the improved version of the car feel good for the trouble.4. Gas, Paint and Repair stops The spray stops are ok, and having to repair the car first before experiencing their full potential feels... out of place for Burnout. And I only find Gas stations useful for free roam.What I don't like is that repair stops make the marked man and road rage events FAR TOO EASY...5. Marked Man eventsThey're challenging, I like that. You have to reach the end while you'll being chased by multiple enemies that are constantly shunting and ramming you to wreck you car, it's pretty much Road Rage but it is a race instead of racking up takedowns, BUT you can take those cars down to fill up your boost meter.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------So yeah I'll just put the pros and cons now...Pros Open World Tons of events Lots of cars Stunt jumps, billboards, shortcuts to find and complete. New event typesCons Unlocking cars feels more like a chore than a reward Less features compared to it's predecessor Old event types removed Repair shops make road rage events too easy.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall I recommend this game all the way, I bought it when it was on sale and I encourage you to do it aswell... but to be honest if you come across Burnout Revenge for the PS2/PS3/XBOX360 get that instead.

												Bought this game when it was on sale over the cyber monday for pure nostaglia. I 100% completed the game twice on the 360 and was top 100 in the US for ranked racing for over 3 months on the 360. This game is amazing for those of you looking to get it. Be warned though EA doesn't support the Store anymore so if you are looking for the Legendary, Boost Special, or Toy cars from the 360 or PS3 you will have to buy a key online. (Amazon for $10) This ultimate box comes with 2 free bikes and another big content patch. It also comes with the optional Offline Multiplayer Party Pack which was a seperate DLC on the 360 and PS3. Also the Cops and Robbers and Island DLC are NOT released on PC and probably never will be. Multiplayer racing from ranked to freeburn is still support with Voice Chat, no text chat however. Haven't found any controller combatibility apart from a driving wheels. Still a fantastic racing game!			",76,15,2,14,8,0,23

												Arcade to the Maaaaaaaaaaaaax!This time in Paradise City (open ""world"")As a great fan of the series, since Burnout 3 Takedown, I'm glad the Paradise Ultimate Box is available on PC/Steam. I also bought it on my 360 back in 2009 and with the controller support in the Steamversion its pretty much the same feeling so to speak. But of course the whole graphics looks much much better.Content stays the same except the Big Surf Island DLC, which is NOT available on PC :<Bikes, Mini Cars are in.Pros:+ variety of races+ many Cars, 3 main types of cars/boost (race, stunt, crash)+ bikes+ graphics, sound+ DJ + soundtrackCons:- No BSI DLC- No Trafficattack (as in Burnout Revenge)IMHO Paradise adds the openworld feature to its predecessor and almost exceeds your ""need for speed"" so to speak. This Game will definitely match your expectations as an Arcade and Burnoutfan.Just hit the Boost and get it on!			",62,2,2,1,2,0,2

												burnout paridise isv a great racing game. its fun, adrenolin filled and full of awsome cars.but it has a few problemes. all the acounts i've created on the pc have dissipered. plus the ultimate box  dose not include all of the dlc. the other main problem is the in game store dosen't work. so if  your looking to buy this game, find it for the Xbox 360 or the PS 3. because all you can get with this edition is the motocycle pack. iwas hopeing steam would fix this, but they seem to not have noticed the problem. maby get the dlc on the steam store but it hasen't happend yet. so in conclusion if your looking to get any adons by the console version, and if your cool with just the base game and the 4 motocycles this is the game for you. so in the end this game is a maby. buyers beware.

												I bought and loved this game on the xbox 360 and when it came up in a steam sale I was really pleased to get it as the online component was so much fun and my xbox had died.  Sadly it seems that this part of the game has long since been disabled, so it was a wasted purchase for me.Still a really fun racing game though, with plenty of variety and the stunt driving alone was worth the price.

												This game is absolutely amazing i love it ,when i was younger i used to play it all the time but one thing that annoyed me badly about this edition is that ea descided to make the dlc content unaccessible to people that want to buy some of the dlc .Which brings me to another point if you are thinking that the ""ultimate box"" edition gives you all the downloadable content and so on ... it does not. The only thing the ""ultimate box"" edition brings to the table are better looking graphics , day/night cycles and motorbikes (2 of wich are accessible at the beginning)Having said that i think this game is absolutley amazing it is incredibly fun and i recomend getting it.A percentage out of a hundred i would give it 89%			",94,9,1,3,8,0,0

												So good!!!  Still my favorite game of all time.  Open world racing, spectacular crashes, awesome soundtrack.  Vehicles: Cars handling is very arcade-y, but very fun.  There are a number of cars with twitchy handling that require more than just throttle mashing to win the races.  A Burning Route time trial event for each car unlocks a slightly upgraded version of that car.  The addition of motorcycles is a nice change of pace with their offline time trial events.Stunt Runs, Road Rages, Marked Man and Race events can be played online or offline.  In addition, there are hundreds of online challenges for 2-8 players.  When you find a good group of online players, it is a lot of fun.Showtime: Crash your way down the road racking up as many points as possible.  Destruction has never been more fun.Road Rules: Set a fast time for every road on the map.  You'll be cursing the traffic but that clean run is so sweet.Criterion, please take a break from Need for Speed and make another Burnout already.Sidenote:  I played this game all the way through to 102% on the PS3 in 2009 and just recently bought it for the PC.  It looks SO much better on the PC.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Online population is next to dead and full regulars that exploit or outright cheat. But still, online/offline there is plenty to do in this game. There are three event types (race, stunt run, and road rage [online has challenges outside of these]) and 50+ cars consisting of three types (boost, rage, and stunt) that change how you play to fill up your boost. Your car selection is limited in online events (race, stunt, and rage), but has no restriction in Freeburn (online no event) and while doing online challenges. Offline play usu. requires specific vehicles to complete progress (i.e. dependent on event type). Regardless of online or offline play the entire map is completely open. Online you work with others to complete achievements or participate in events and offline you work to unlock cars.The only issue is that the game will disconnect players from host (no dedicated servers) at times when the hosts start events, most regularly during races. Challenges do not seem to be effected by this issue. And there is no in-game chat ability other than a mic, which, thankfully, you have the ability to mute players if their mic has feedback or they are trolling.			",94,4,7,8,12,1,12

												Not an amazing game in the least, but it is definitely fun.  I really enjoy games that set you up with challenges to beat.  I have never been much of a racing game fan, but this game is not really meant to be taken seriously.  You do crazy stunts, crash your car into others for points, run from other racers chasing you, and just flat out race.  Also, the little mini challenges are nice.  Trying to beat the best time on a certain street really keeps the game interesting.  Just a nice little simple game where you just have to progress, unlock better equipment (cars), and beat your best scores.  I like it and recommend it.			",219,48,3,47,30,0,38

												What an awesome game. While it is true that this game is about smashing other cars with even bigger cars or flying through the streets with a GTR car, there's more to that than it seems at the first glance.This is an open world racer, and, unlike Need For Speed or other games of that sort, this is not only about how hard can you drift, but also how well are your navigation skills. By far the most exciting races I've ever had, with three cars approaching finish from three different streets. Outwitting the enemies by taking another route. Gosh, this game is amazing.Also, awesome soundtrack ranging from Avril Lavigne to Guns n Roses and Claud Debussy. Great graphics and optimization.While some might say that the unlicensed cars are taking out the immersion, imo it adds to the feel of the imaginary Paradise City and are awesome.10/10 would bundle again			",170,34,27,21,16,1,15

												Great graphics and sound. However the announcer is annoying sometimes. Wish he would stop talking so much.  I also wish the city had people walking around would give the city more life.  The fake city they use is very big and colorful. The cars look great and the damage model is very good indeed. I have not tried online play. The biggest knock against this game besides the lack of a true gps system was that you could not restart an event if you failed it. Sure you could drive back to the event but that may be very far away and take a while. However that has been fixed and now you can restart a failed race removing a lot of the frustration I had with the game. The cars handle well and the racing is somewhat varied.  This edition does not include the dlc island that was only for the xbox however if you search you can find a fan made island made for this game. The game is great fun and I do recommend this game to all. 9/10 a great game.			",299,147,32,35,36,9,44

However, this means you can get to know lots of different areas, and hone your expertise that way. If you want to fully complete the game, be aware there may be a lot of repetition.

WARNING!!! I'll be comparing this game to ""Burnout Revenge""; it's predecessor.This is the last entry of the main Burnout series, and I feel that it is a strong game, it is really fun to play. But compared to the previous game... it fell short for me. Lemme explain:I used to play Burnout Revenge on my PS2 and I had a blast playing through it, I haven't played it in over 2 years but there are a lot of things missing in Paradise.1. Traffic Checking Sure in this game you can get ""Traffick Check Takedown"" which is crashing into a traffic car, causing it to lose control and crashing into an oponent... BUT in Revenge if you crashed into the back of a traffic car you could just launch it into oblivion (and possible other racers), in fact, traffic checking was actually a whole game mode in Revenge, where you had to crash into as many cars as possible before you ran out of time, by chaining them and throwing them into Trucks and Busses and oncoming traffic for bonus time and points.In Paradise you can't do it... which I learned the hard way...2. Crash Events Yes you can trigger a crash event by pressing LB+RB on your Xbox controller (not sure on keyboard) but they only serve as a ""record"" on the different roads of the game... in Revenge they were MASSIVE, you had to launch your car into a heavily transited intersection; you could unlock heavy cars for those events specifically, If you have played ""Turbo Dismount"" then you'll know how those worked on Revenge, except that once you did enough damage your boost meter would feel and you'd have to mash the boost button to BLOW UP and causing even more damage to other cars and even reach cars that were too far away from you. Beating those events would unlock more ranks, events and cars.3. Burnout TakedownsYou can't do these in Paradise... In Revenge (after you unlock the ability of course), when you crashed in a Road Rage or Race event you could press a button (Don't remember which one) and blow up, taking other racers with you, racking up your score in Road Rage, or diminish your dissadvantage after crashing.4. Double, Triple and more takedownsIn Paradise if you manage to force 2 or more racers into a wall and they all crash, you only get credit for one of those; in Revenge if you do that it would show you the first crash and say ""TAKEDOWN!"" and immediately shift to the other crashed car and say ""Double Takedown"" and even if you don't get the camera for the takedowns you still got credit for those... making Road Rage events a lot more satisfying to beat.5. AFTERTOUCHAftertouch is an ability in most Burnout games (At least on Burnout 3, Revenge, and Dominator) where if you crash into a wall or traffic car, you could slow down time and move your car in the air, this means you can place yourself in front of oponents for them to crash into you... AND IT COUNTS AS TAKEDOWNS, which meant that if you made a mistake you could take the competition with you!Unfortunately you can't use aftertouch in Paradise, If you crash you can actually spin if the front wheels are touching the ground... but even if you manage to position yourself in front of someone, it won't count as a takedown... sure it makes them crash and lose their advantage... but it feels a lot more satisfying to read ""AFTERTOUCH TAKEDOWN"" and even adding a DOUBLE or TRIPLE if you cause 2 or 3 oponents to crash into you. This also means that on Road Rage events you won't get credit for doing that.6. More CarsI like how you unlock cars by smashing them into a wall in Paradise. However in Revenge you were constantly unlocking new cars by getting medals in all of the events, however in Paradise it feels more of a chore to unlock them instead of a rewards...In fact I ALT+F4 out of the game multiple times because I couldn't reach the car I had to unlock and when I finally got close, I do a curve wrong or crash into traffic and completely lose the damn car... Also in Revenge there was a list of objectives in every location (I think there were 9 locations... not sure on that one) and they were pretty much the same, but they were really difficult to beat, The ones I remember the best are: Get a vertical takedown Win a clean race (No crashes) Beat X event in Y ammount of timeThere were more but those are the ones I remember and what do you get for beating all of the objectives?ONE OF THE BEST CARS IN THE GAMEIt was rewarding to beat them.7. Signature TakedownsI think even RIvals for the Nintendo DS had signature takedowns... if you crashed an oponent in a specific spot on an event you'll get multiple angles of the crash and ""pictures"" AND you'll unlock the signature takedown (actually quite useless but it still feels satisfying to know that you did it.)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now that I'm done comparing this one with Revenge I'll express my opinion on the new features the game has.1. Open WorldMeh... to be honest Burnout doesn't need an open world, it has always been about the events and races, but physically reaching each event doesn't really fit with the pace of this game.2. Stunt RunsThey're really fun, I like just jumping all over the place, drifting and finding shortcuts and stunt jumps on the way, And crashing against something finishing your combo feels fait, you crash? start the combo again.3. Time TrialsI don't like how you always have to change cars for these events, you know a little pop-up saying ""would you like to change your car?"" would be nice for these events, as junk yards are often far away and sometimes I forget which car was I supposed to get into... Although unlocking the improved version of the car feel good for the trouble.4. Gas, Paint and Repair stops The spray stops are ok, and having to repair the car first before experiencing their full potential feels... out of place for Burnout. And I only find Gas stations useful for free roam.What I don't like is that repair stops make the marked man and road rage events FAR TOO EASY...5. Marked Man eventsThey're challenging, I like that. You have to reach the end while you'll being chased by multiple enemies that are constantly shunting and ramming you to wreck you car, it's pretty much Road Rage but it is a race instead of racking up takedowns, BUT you can take those cars down to fill up your boost meter.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------So yeah I'll just put the pros and cons now...Pros Open World Tons of events Lots of cars Stunt jumps, billboards, shortcuts to find and complete. New event typesCons Unlocking cars feels more like a chore than a reward Less features compared to it's predecessor Old event types removed Repair shops make road rage events too easy.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall I recommend this game all the way, I bought it when it was on sale and I encourage you to do it aswell... but to be honest if you come across Burnout Revenge for the PS2/PS3/XBOX360 get that instead.

												Great fun, one of the few non-Kart racing games that I truly enjoy playing.  The music selection is wonderful, the car selection is great, and online play is perfection!  Only down side is not as many people online as there used to be, but that is to be expected from a game of this age.  Oh, and the car crashes... those wonderful car crashes... they are the best part.  It's like a city-wide demolition derby and it is as fun as that sounds!One note, if you get a blank white screen when going online, just close it.  It's a leftover from when EA actually supported it with an online store.  Now that the store is gone, all that's left is a blank screen.  It's annoying at first, but you learn to ignore it soon enough.Played using a Logitech E-X5D12 Driving Force Feedback Wireless Wheel Controller.  I had to remap the controls in the game, they were awful, but once it's configured, the experience is amazing!			",405,112,26,34,34,8,57

												This game is absolutely amazing i love it ,when i was younger i used to play it all the time but one thing that annoyed me badly about this edition is that ea descided to make the dlc content unaccessible to people that want to buy some of the dlc .Which brings me to another point if you are thinking that the ""ultimate box"" edition gives you all the downloadable content and so on ... it does not. The only thing the ""ultimate box"" edition brings to the table are better looking graphics , day/night cycles and motorbikes (2 of wich are accessible at the beginning)Having said that i think this game is absolutley amazing it is incredibly fun and i recomend getting it.A percentage out of a hundred i would give it 89%			",94,9,1,3,8,0,0

												This is a good racing game.But instead of just racing, you can also take down your enemies, easily the thing that sets the game series Burnout apart from others. And it's very fun. Another unusual thing is that, while you're racing (or are playing the other modes), there are no arrows to guide you, no boundries. You must rely on your mini-map and / or compass to get to the finishing line. The game has a massive open world with over four hundred shortcuts that you can learn in order to get to the finishing line quicker than the others can. There are also some other ""collectibles"". You also find events (Racing, Marked Man, Road Rage...) only by exploring the map. The main goal of the game is to get a Burnout Driving License, which you can only get by winning the aforementioned events. You get cars every time you upgrade your license, and when you shut down certain cars.The game also has an online mode, where you can play the same events that you can on singleplayer, but with actual people. Sadly, Race is the only properly made event, as the other ones really haven't had much love given to them. When you're not doing an event in multiplayer, you're on freeburn, where you try beating other people's records (no. of barrel rolls, air distance, etc.). It's quite fun, even if it has its flaws.Now, let's talk about the port: it's bad. The online mode doesn't even have a chat. You can only communicate with other people with voice chat. The menus are really odd too. The optimization is alright. I do have some FPS drops in areas with lots of cars and action, but you can kinda blame it on my PC (although I expected it to perform a bit better regardless). The fast menu is also impossible to access unless you have a controller, which is a problem because that's the menu that allows you to change teams in certain multiplayer events such as Road Rage.Overall, it's a good game. And it's cheap. You don't really need a controller, the keyboard works just fine. It has its flaws, but overall you should get it if you're a fan of racing. 8/10 ",64,2,5,2,3,0,2

												This is the racer I come back to again and again and again. It's endlessly enjoyable, the dificulty curved nicely for people who don't play racers.  Expect arcade style physics and fun first.  Excellent XBox controller integration with D-Pad online options.  This racer looks great on older PCs and machines with very modest or even no dedicated video card.  Downsides: you gotta have your EA login handy, and you might get a wee bit tired of the title GNR song.			",196,27,3,5,6,1,14

The online challenges requires a lot of teamwork but if you are playing with the right players, you'll achieve them fast.The soundtracks are pretty epic as, the city looks visually amazing.Too bad this game never got the Cops N' Robbers and Secret Island DLC's for PC.If you want to go to Paradise City, then pick this game as fast as you can. :DMy Rating: 9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Burnout: Paradise has something for every type of gamer. If you just like the racing aspect, you got it. Do you just like showcasing cars in action? there's the stunt mode so you can take snapshots of your card in mid-air. Or you're like me and like crashing into♥♥♥♥♥♥and watching it tumble around, that's what road rage mode is for. Also, you can just activate this mode where your car suddenly starts flipping and the objective is to cause as much damage to other cars before you loose momentum.This game still plays as good as when it came out and hasn't felt any older. The world is so big, some people can still get lost in the middle of a heated race in multiplayer. The variety of cars is there and each one drives really differently. I would buy it now since it still has people playing it.			",261,12,11,22,10,0,17

												Burnout Paradise is one of the best arcade racers you will ever play. The concept of the game is simple and fun. It can get a tad bit tedious if you play for too long by yourself. However, there are some party modes that can allow for some fun multiplayer action (only 1 controller needed). Not all of the DLC is included (1 or 2 fun but unncessary dlc) in the package for some reason. I think this is because EA was like ""f*** it. These guys need to be ripped off, even if it's only slighty"".			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												 Burnout Paradise is a game that has taken the open world elements that we have all loved from the past, along with a racing game tied into the formula. Not only does Burnout give players an open world, but uses a great way to unlock cars. There are many ways to unlock cars. From performing the same old race to driving down the highway to smash a rival that is in pursuit, Paradise is very edgy and also easy for players to level up and climb the ranks. Along with the open world and unlockable items, Burnout allows players to experience driving in a whole new level with a Slow-Motion camera designed to see crashes or takedowns in a whole new way. This feature actually makes crashing a little more rewarding (as weird as it sounds) than that of just completing a race. With a great Single-Player along with a fun Multiplayer  Burnout is a must have title in anybody's library. ",33,3,1,0,9,3,0

DO NOT BUY THE £4.99 ON HERE.go on {LINK REMOVED} and you can get it half the price. its not worth paying £5 when you dont get the benefits from it that you were expecting.Game Review:NOSTALGIC. started playing this as my first game on ps3 and loved to play this game again! the action packed races to the adrenaline rushed free roam. you will be hooked in seconds. pretty good graphics for the game it is bearing in mind it is fairly old now! I play this game in the max settings and it is an absolute blast to play with. really brings the game to life.OVERALL RATING 7/10 (lost 3 due to not being able to have dlc, apart from that the game is AWESOME!!!)

												This game is getting older as we speak. The game is a classic and is really the best Burnout game in the series, I love this game personally and can play it for hours with its multiple missions and many different cars. The cars in this game... Well I love them really, starting the cars driving them at high speeds through the city and the hills. There are many DLCs ,which you know I hate, but there is a definate way to bypass that. The cars are all interesting and really fun to drive, the handling is very easy and you can definatley feel the freedom when you're driving.Firstly the cars in this are awesome! You can get many styles of cars such as: Rage, stunt, street and that wierd turbo thing that only lets you recharge... The entire car system has many different styles of driving, the cars can be stock or the upgraded unlocked version of the original car. You can get mini cars, police cars and many more random types of new cars which can only be found on the origin store. The DLC for paradise island is only avalible for the console versions of this game but you can mod it into the game which adds buggys and a whole new island. The entire games map is massive compared to new games and its nicley detailed, the whole thing has events placed ""at every intersection"" as explained in the first part of the game which is true! Events on every intersection which can be played again but only to beat your score.The map concludes of beaches, mountains and city scapes with loads of driving to do. I had some technical problems with the game trying to set up multiplayer, EA actually sent me a copy onto my Origin account which then worked. The games multiplayer consists of free drive, races, stunt runs and free races (which is where you set up your own races for your friends). I like playing with my friends because you can have a lot of fun seeing who can get the biggest air alltogether in a certain place or just driving for fun. Multiplayer does have a negative side to it though, its very anoying to setup with multiple game platforms Steam/Origin but I was the only one with this problem.The game does have DLC but noone wants to pay for that so some nice modding community have recreated Paradise Island from the Xbox and Playstation games, the mod also allows you to change cars at random points and adds all of the DLC without EA coming to rip your wallet apart. The DLC is quite fun and you can have lots of random moments with your friends. The mod also allows you to change to any citizen car with any paint scheme which is a nice feature.Only problems that I had. On a Windows 7 Computer it worked fine for a series of time, it would crash ocasionally but that might of been because of my older setup. The game works well with old and new Windows but I had some problems with a Win10 machine, but my friends computer (WIN8) worked fine. I was trying to get the game running with two monitors but then I realised I my older setup was screen center to left which for some reason broke burnout completley but when I disconnected it, the game ran smoothly.You can have hours of fun on any burnout game but especially this one with its free world and ability to choose to do missions when you want to. So I recommend buying this, but remember to play it with friends because it is extremely fun messing around with some areas!			",146,25,18,15,30,1,14

												Excellent game.  If this exact same game was made today it would be a 10 or 20 GB download, but since it was made back when programmers knew how to program code right, it's only a 2.9 GB Download and looks as good or better than current day racing games.  Open world and racing is extremely fun.  Have windows 7 x64 system, and did not have to do anything special to get it to run on my system.Only negative thing about game is what they left out, no Crash Mode.			",163,10,2,26,5,1,4

												So I have played alot of burnout on the first Xbox (not sure which version anymore) and had loads of fun playing it.That's why when I saw this game on sale for only €2,50 I instantly bought it.Pros- You're free to do what you want.- The music in the game is really good and if you don't like a song you can easily skip it.- Easy to learn.- Alot of different things to do.Cons- I don't really like the new crash system (called showtime in this game).- No windowed option in the game.- You need to login to a EA account (you can play offline without).- I have 7 hours in this game and until now I find it a bit too easy.Overall I really like this game and it was well worth my money, and I would recommend this to other people,Rating: 8/10			",58,10,2,1,8,0,4

												Completed this game twice on PlayStation 3, spent lots of hours online, set thousand of records, and I still can't seem to get enough of it. Purchased it again just because this is really one of the best racing games. Graphics looks more dates than I remember it, although now I can play it in 3D! But the speed, the adrenaline, the sheer fun and the superb soundtrack are still there. God I missed DJ Atomica. Amazing place where the grass is green and the girls are pretty, won't you just take me home. For this price the game is an absolute must-buy. Also still one of the best car destructions. And the best car weight feeling ever.			",131,8,1,12,2,0,7

												One of the best arcade racing games to come out after the Need For Speed Underground 1 & 2 games.However today the game is a bit old, but for the asking price and on a sale, it's still worth it.Both the SP and MP was fun, when I Played it on the PS3. I even got the Platinum trophy.Seems I can't load my stuff from the PS3 to Steam even though, it uses the same EA/Origin account.Back then, I would give the game a nearly perfect score, but today there are newer games out there.Still recommend it though, if you just want a cheap fun arcade racer, to play from time to time.

												It's some great old-school racing fun, with a ton of content for a very small price.You have an upgrade path with lots of cars in three main groups: speed, stunt and destruction. You collect these as you win races and challenges, both as rewards and as target which you have to take down in order to collect them.You can play offline with challenges from simple races, not-so-simple races, stunt challenges and races where you are the target for other cars who are trying to destroy your vehicle.You can also play online with friends and strangers, setting up races, simple ones or with multiple check points, car limits, boost limits or a free-for all. You will need a free EA/Origin account to play online and to add friends to your friends list requires installing Origin.There are some annoying quirks (the UI navigation involves ESC, F1, F2 and Backspace!) and the theme song that plays every time you launch the game (To stop it: Go to Steam\steamapps\common\Burnout(TM) Paradise The Ultimate Box\SOUND\STREAMS and replace the file GUNS_AND_ROSES.SNS with a blank text file of the same name (including extension)) and there's this blank page that pops up requiring you to hit ""Return to Game"" every so often in the menu (The fix to that is to add  127.0.0.1 portal.burnoutweb.ea.com to your hosts file). I guess that's some hangover they forgot to fix when they stopped supporting whatever was on that page, but once you've done that, it's plain sailing.It's a good little game!			",80,15,2,8,6,1,12

												Wow, I had such a great time with this game on the PS3. I played it for over 100 hours and it's still a great game ! The graphics were (are) amazing, and it reminded me a bit of Midtown Madness, another favorite of mine. There are no pedestrians in this game - I'd normally complain about this -  but there is just so much traffic and you're driving at such high speeds that you'll hardly ever notice there's not a person to be found in this game. There are a lot of cars. You can win them by finishing races or by crashing into them while driving around (which reminded me of Chase HQ, another excellent chasing game). The crashes look spec-ta-cu-lar and there's just so much to do ! Destroy billboards, crash into gates, win cars, win races, do stunts; you name it, it's there. One of the best (yes, the BEST !) racing games ever. Hoping for a sequel. Fingers crossed.[Rating: 90/100]			",1657,631,69,221,194,16,225

												This is a game ive had for a while now, but I've only recently started playing a lot of. Its one of the most origininal driving games I think I've ever seen. It completly throws the generic 'standard circuit' racing convention and replaced it with an open city where you have to get from point A to B by choosing which roads to take while still driving your opponents into the ground (quite literally). The graphics side to this game are... ok but  if you stop your car for a moment and actually look around. the scenery seems less authentic and 2D (but you will get this in EVERY racing game becuase why the hell have you stopped your car to look at the scenery). The multiplayer in this is probably what makes it most interesting and fun. Mulitple different modes, not just racing but co-op challenges, sandbox mode A.K.A freeburn and all the other crazy stuff in between.8/10Deffinaltley one to buy especially if you have some friends to play online with you.

I dont know what to expect anymore! the only thing is why cnt there be like 1 cop car that roams the street and if you run from him he calls back up for you to ram into. Other than that, this game is deffinately worth getting.			",45,2,8,8,5,0,3

												I adore this game. If there is a game that's similar to it, think Midnight Club. IMO this game is better. Great graphics and physics, a large amount of content, multiplayer, etc. Very fun. Criterion hit the nail on the head with this title. The only downside imo is the menus which are a bit awkward and clunky, seeing as they were designed for potatoes. 9.5/10 Would recommend.			",92,12,3,5,12,0,12

												I orignally had this game on the PS3, but I have since sold the console and have purchased it for PC.Burnout Paradise is one of the few racing games that I have seen that offers so much freedom. The game takes place in a giant open world map populated with objective challenges like races, stunt competitions, and road rage (take out other cars) competitions. Additionally, the world incentivises you to explore by making you search for hidden areas, big jumps, and billboards to smash through. There are many billboards that seem impossible to access, but after looking around, you'll finally find the hidden jump needed to access it.The game features very satisfying driving mechanics that allow you to drift around corners with ease. At the same time, the game has over 100 different cars that all have a very unique handling behavior and charm. You will gradually unlock faster and more resilient cars as you complete challenges across the map. Even after unlocking the late game cars, I still like to drive around in the earlier cars from time to time for their appearance and driving experience.The online mode of the game is also really entertaining. You can freely roam around and the city and chase after your friends to try and take them down. Alternatively, you can team up with your friends to try and complete online challenges. Some challenges are quite difficult, as they require a specific number of players and require you to complete a task under a time limit. However, the reward for completing all of the online tasks is a very exclusive (and dapper) car.Overall, one of my favorite car/racing games I have ever played because of the freedom, exploration, and online activities. The downside to the game is it is no longer updated, so there are many patches needed for minor bugfixes and stability fixes on newer operating systems.As many have said, ""The Ultimate Box"" does not include the DLC of Big Surf Island, the legendary cars, or the toy cars. Despite the exclusion of DLC, this game is definately worth the buy during a sale.			",33,0,3,3,5,2,17

												Wow, I had such a great time with this game on the PS3. I played it for over 100 hours and it's still a great game ! The graphics were (are) amazing, and it reminded me a bit of Midtown Madness, another favorite of mine. There are no pedestrians in this game - I'd normally complain about this -  but there is just so much traffic and you're driving at such high speeds that you'll hardly ever notice there's not a person to be found in this game. There are a lot of cars. You can win them by finishing races or by crashing into them while driving around (which reminded me of Chase HQ, another excellent chasing game). The crashes look spec-ta-cu-lar and there's just so much to do ! Destroy billboards, crash into gates, win cars, win races, do stunts; you name it, it's there. One of the best (yes, the BEST !) racing games ever. Hoping for a sequel. Fingers crossed.[Rating: 90/100]			",1657,631,69,221,194,16,225

												Because this game has Avril Lavigne's Girlfriend in this game OST, I consider this game's soundtrack a good one.The game's mechanics and everything else in the game are very well done and the game is a unique racing experience, compared to most other games I've played.Trust me, this game is a ♥♥♥♥ing great one and I recommend you buy it as soon as you can. It's totally worth the £5 or less if it goes on sale.Here's an extra screenshot for the Avril Lavigne fans:

												I once played this game when I was younger, and since I bought it for my PC, I have had so much fun re-living my childhood experience of playing this game. Sometimes it's fun to just drive around and explore the map, trying to do all of the super jumps. Sometimes it's fun to do races to try and get cars. It adds the idea of free roaming with the idea of a storyline, except the only quest is to get your license grade up.			",81,9,3,8,17,2,7

												The best arcade racing game available for PC. Simple as that. I would rank this at number 3 in the Burnout franchise with Burnout: Revenge coming as number one and Burnout 3 coming second. The gameplay in this game gets really repetitive after you reach 50% of total progress but the rush never ends. Graphics and sound (AND the soundtrack) are very, very nice considering this is now 5 years old and it works without a hiccup on any modern PC (first time played it on a dual core Athlon X2 3000+ with 2GB RAM and a HD 4670 and it never ever slowed down), all settings maxed out. I would recommend this to anyone even remotely interested in racing games, it's worth every penny. I would give it 8.8/10.			",520,133,13,57,30,7,62

												The game is immense and easily my favorite car game of all time.75 cars in the basic pack, each with a basic ""Type"" which is how it accumulates boost. You'll be doing a lot of boosting. And they all feel a little different than one another. They have since added several different packs of cars, so many that I honestly can't count, with their own challenges. Every stoplight in the game is a different mission. The game itself is pretty straightforward, there's a location at each compass point of the city at which all the challenges end, and they come in a few different flavors loosely coinciding with the car types. Beyond that, drive around a big♥♥♥♥♥city at enormous speed, creating breathtaking car crashes and listening to classic rock and trying to get your next car unlock. Cons: Not gameplay related, but rather EA's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port programming. You will probably need to configure your own controls, although the game makes it pretty painless. I also had a problem caused by the game's attempt to take my picture for my driver's license (don't bother, it's VERY glitchy, but a cool idea)--every time I tried to open the menu it would crash. Fixed it by turning off the webcam driver (I don't have a webcam) in my control panel and it's been running smoothly ever since.Anyway, technical problems aside, this is the Skyrim of car games and you should get it if you have even a passing interest. I don't like racing games but I love this damn game. For 5$ in a sale, it's a no-brainer.Edit: in case you were concerned that my playtime is too low to be this positive, I have at least 30-40 hours on the XBox version. I was very happy to return it to my library on steam by buying it a second time.			",93,20,1,17,10,0,19

												Great game. Bad DLC implementation. The ""Ultimate"" part of ""The Ultimate Box"" likely refers to this being the last boxed version of the game. Sure it has everything released up till then, but more DLC came after, and most of it is difficult to impossible to get with a Steam copy of the game. You can get more on Origin (so I hear), but I haven't had the time or inclination to find out for sure.But seriously, this is a great game. I've loved the Burnout Series since Takedown, and while it's nice to see some Burnout rubbing off on EA's other driving series, Need For Speed =/= Burnout. Heck, Forza Horizon has been cribbing from Burnout with bonuses for reckless driving (oncoming, near misses, etc.). Whatever. If you like over the top racing action, you can't do much better than Burnout Paradise!			",792,283,17,132,88,8,165

												Late to the party, my children and I installed this a year or two ago.  We all loved the Guns N Roses Paradise City intro.  We all loved the handling, the events, the world, the graphics, the cars, the constant carrot dangling in front of us.  I fired the game back up recently and noticed I wanted to do something, anything in the world in addition to just driving.  I couldn't get out of my car:)  I guess I wanted to play GTAV.  I think that Burnout Paradise: The Ultimate Box is one of the best racing games I've ever played, and because of this it gets a 9/10.  However, with the rise in the quality of open world games that contain vehicles these past few years (superior handling, tons of different types of drive modes and camera angles, etc.), I wonder what the future holds for racing games.

												I wish I had this game during its hey day. Oh well, better late than never. The smarmy hints and tips are more than idle entertainment or taunting...they actually tell you some things that assist you moving out of a rut you may find yourself in from time to time. I love that I can play this game how I want to play it. The order in which you achieve your objectives is entirely up to you, which I happen to like. I love the unstructured game play very much, with countless surprises -at times, rewarding surprises - along the way. As usual, the tunes can be good, at least for a little while anyway. If you like racing games and cars, this one is a classic must have. An oldie, but a goodie.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Back in my PS2 days I owned Burnout 2 and Takedown and loved the games - played them to bits. When I saw this was up for grabs on a  Steam sale I jumped at the chance.The game is not quite what I was expecting. It's very different to what I thought it would be. That's not to say some of the changes are not for the better, but on the other hand, some aren't.Graphics look brilliant, and the cars still have that same Burnout ""feel"" to them. The game modes all make a return too - but this time in an open world map. Think NFSU 2 and you will be on the right tracks. This is great, but you seem to spent a lot of time driving around for no reason. I would much prefer to just race and perform the stages without this unnecessary addition. The races themselves also suffer from the same problem of being given too much freedom - you will accidentally go the wrong way because you are concentrating on driving and not constantly looking at the map.O yes, and no 2 player split screen? Not good :-(Bar the problems I have with it though, it's still a good game. Burnout fans will find something to their liking here.Jimbo Rating: 5/10			",134,5,5,9,5,0,4

												I have been playing this game since it was released in 2008, and still absolutely love it. To me it is the definitive arcade style racing game that nothing else since has come close to.AFAIK it was the first Xbox 360 racing game to run at 60fps and immediately that made all the difference not just in visuals but in amazingly tight controls that are responsive even in the fastest cars the game has to offer, and they are very fast! Even though they run it at 60fps, the visuals are only now starting to get surpassed by rival games, but the gameplay is still king.It was a divisive game when it came out due to its open world sandbox style that immediately alienated the majority of people who tried the demo and I think it never got the recognition it deserved because of that. The sandbox world is actually the games strength, rather than be another arcade style race from a-b on a set route, in BP you needed to learn your way around the game world, the more you learned, the better you get. The game world is a staggering achievement, and even now after playing it for years, I am still finding new things.As the game is very cheap now, I would recommend it to anyone who likes arcade style racing games, put the effort in to playing and learning it, and it will reward you with one of the best games ever.

												When I first got a Playstation 3 this was one of the 1st games I got, and even til today this is my favorite game that I've ever played.  This game is the most fun I've had on a racer, and there's just so much content in here, with races, stunt runs, marked man races, the Road Rages, plus all the unlockable cars.The only negative I have, is that it appears that the ""Ultimate Box"" does not include all the DLC that was available on the Ps3, namely the expansion ""Big Surf Island"" or the Cops/Robbers pack. I don't know if the Legendary Cars are included either.  If not, I'm very disappointed in that, as I thought this ""Ultimate Box"" would actually have everything in it.I got this in a Humble Bundle, so I can't be too upset, plus it IS my favorite game ever, so I'm good.  Would just have loved to have Big Surf Island, as I love the Dune Buggy car.This is HIGHLY recommended.  So much fun, and this is one of the few games I'll play online.			",69,31,1,2,5,4,23

												One of the best racing games out there. No matter how many years have passed since it launched, I still come back to it to have fun racing and crashing cars.HOWEVER, beware many people, including myself, are having problems starting up the game. I believe the game servers shutdown, and ever since it's been a pain to get it working. Startup game homepage (there is an ingame browser that starts everytime you start the game, before opening the actual game) is broken, so working around this to get the game working is a painful process, unless criterion releases a game patch.In the mean time, go to the file burnoutparadise.exe location (right click in steam game, properties, browse file location), and then in windows explorer right click the burnoutparadise.exe file, set it in compatibility with windows xp sp3, and that will do it. It did it for me, after a research on the web on how to make it work.If you have the option to get this game on console, is a different story. The consoles work with no problem (ps3 and xbox 360), but the game will not be as beautiful as it is on PC. It's your choice.One of my favorite racing games of all time.			",78,1,15,4,3,0,2

												A good racing game in my opinion. Its fast paced, with slow-mo crashes, jumps, side swiping, drifting and awesome looking cars. You can sink a lot of time into this game, but by the time you unlock the fastest car, you'll be tired of this game. The races leave something to be desired, because the racing AI is really predicatable and quite slow making races really easy. I probably lost five offline races out of 140+ races. Most of the fun I had in this game was driving around in freeroam, drifting, finding cool jumps and trying to unlock every car and its upgraded counterpart. Review: 7.5/10Fast, sexy cars, explosions, crashes but a lack of depth hurts the game plus DJ Atomica makes you want to end your life.			",49,1,1,3,1,0,0

												I'll be completely honest here, I installed this with pretty low hopes. I've seen what Criterion have done to the NFS franchise, which wasn't exactly stellar but it was fun, and figured they'd done more of the same with the Burnout series. But I am really enjoying this so far. The driving is direct and responsive, taking down an aggro car with a speed car is super satisfying too, that slow mo crash gives you that much loved moment of smugness. Graphically it's quite pretty for its year and it runs really well even on low end machines. So in summation, it's a damn fun game, the shelf life to cost ratio is damn high too. I'd recommend this game to anyone that enjoys racing games and those that enjoy a good hit and run, arcade style racer too.			",373,34,20,27,11,4,7

Já estamos falando de um ""Clássico"" que felizmente voltou a ser jogável (e Online) no PC!Longa Históra, mas depois de um Update da Origin mesmo com o jogo instalado totalmente pela Steam(?) foi recuperado um Save que aparentemente estava perdido para sempre, assim como a possibilidade de se jogar Online, e funciona! Servidores melhores que de alguns jogos mais novos da EA!Burnout Paradise em Si é um excelente Arcade Racing Game, que diverte MUITO com seus gráficos, carros, trilha sonora e jogabilidade caracteristicos, em época de Promoção é encontrado a 5 Reais, o que na minha humilde opinião, com o atual estado do jogo, o torna imprescindível para fãs de corrida!

												Burnout Paradise was a surprise for me. And a good one at that. bought it for around a dollar, didn't expect alot from the game, but what i found was one of the most enjoyable racing experiences i have ever had, up there with need for speed most wanted 2005. The physics in the game are really well made, and the chrashes are as cinematic as it gets, for one of the first times i actually enjoyed crashing my cars, so i could see it getting smashed in slow motion. Crashing was never so fun. The biggest problem in the game for me is that there's one waypoint system of any sort, even while you're racing, sometimes you will get lost or take a wrong turn just to find out that the road you're taking won't lead to the finsih line, but once you get used to the city, you will know it as you know the palm of your hand. Burnout paradise is deffinerely worth picking up because the amount of fun to be had here is insane. I also want to point out how good the soundtrack is, and if you're a rock fan, these words will be enough for you : They axctually have a guns n' roses track in this game. I think thats nuff said.TL;DR JUST BUY IT NOW			",94,8,6,9,5,3,3

GraphicsWell detailed game. You can read (albeit dangerous) the license plates on other cars. The lighting from the sun shines off high gloss paint jobs like in real life. The small detail damages are realistic; if you broke a headlamp it stays broken and doesn’t light up. The back ground is realistic enough to tell distance. I’ve played this at both regular television and hi definition 1080p while it is still good at the lowest setting I highly recommend the playing at the highest possible detail.Sound and MusicYou can tell from just driving around what types of cars are around you with even having to look at that area. The screeching of the tires to the roar of an engine is clear with any vehicle you use. Now the music, quantity or quality wise you will not be disappointed. There are a lot of songs that play while driving around so chances are if you play for an hour or two, you will not hear the same song twice. And you don’t like a particular song you can always take if off the play list. One should note that a good portion of songs are the same songs from older Burnout Games.Game PlayAs you win events you upgrade your license. The higher the license, the larger amount of vehicles you will be able to use. These events are littered all thought Paradise City. To start the event simple pull up to a light to start it.Here is the events.Races: Standard Race. From one to seven other opponents you drive to a specific end point.Road Rage: Timed Event. You use your vehicle as a battering ram to smash other vehicles into traffic, walls or other hard objects. Target amount is usually displayed. Event ends when either you take to much damage or time ends.Marked Man: Almost like a race. You goal is to reach one destination while four other computer cars try to inflict enough damage to keep you from reaching your destination.Stunts: Use your vehicle like a little acrobat, jumping off ramps, crashing bill boards and doing spins. The more you do in a sequence the more points you get. There is a target score to get per event.Burning Route: One route per vehicle. It’s a timed race where you just have to get to the finish line by a certain time using a certain vehicle. Every route you finish unlocks a upgraded version of the vehicle used.All these events get a bit more difficult as the game wears on but not that much more. I would say once you get used to the way the game plays you find that most of these events range from easy (one or two attempts) to medium (fifteen minutes maximum).Now there are a few side events or tasks that are fun to do. Running certain billboards, barriers, and super jumps. They are littered everywhere, cant be avoided just driving around. There are few hidden but find to fun all of them and as a reward for finding all it unlocks more vehicles. There are also two events per street, one is time trails and the other is showtime. Showtime is just you bouncing around hitting vehicles for points.Online play is quite fun with tasks and races, connections are usually stable. One thing I like is with Xbox Live Vision take a photo of you when you get taken out by another drive and sent to the aggressor. The online experience is a whole new game in itself and worth playing.NegativesAlthough it’s a very good game here is a few of the things I didn’t like. Showtime is very repetitive in the sense you have to do it to all 64 streets of Paradise City. Also Showtime replaced Crash from previous games. The on line challenges are very repetitive where if 2 players you have to do it for 7 players. And some of them are very very basic like driving in oncoming traffic. Also while doing online challenges if one person get disconnected, the challenges are cancelled. The difficulty level is somewhat misleading as the more cars you unlock the easier the game is when trying to do the events.One last thing that kind of surprised me is the amount of advertising in the game, from billboards to vans there is way too much advertising in this game. To show how much advertising there are four unlockable cars, all of them are plastered with the names.			",92,30,4,15,19,1,19

												It's... pretty great, yeah, I'd recommend it if you like racing games. I'm not really sure what to say about it, though.Two things I really don't like: the ""open city"" means that making a wrong turn is considerably worse than crashing and nearly always costs you the race, and that the beginning is really slow - both in terms of cars and fun. Oh, and there's no Crash mode anymore, which suuuucks! That was the best part of Burnout!			",1079,428,34,131,112,11,220

												I'm not really a fan of racing games... but Burnout is something that I really like and enjoy. Around the fictional setting of Paradise City cars are meant to be smashed, shortcuts and super jumps discovered, and multiple routes toward the same finish line exploited. Winning challenges nets you new rides and better licenses to take on more difficult challenges. The city itself isn't a metropolis teeming with life--you won't see pedestrians wandering around or anything like that--but there's plenty of traffic on the roads and shortcuts to discover as you freely drive around. While in the confines of your car you can pull up at stoplights to trigger events of different types, like stunt challenges, races, marked man (reach a finish line while other drivers try to smash you to bits) and road rage (destroy a set number of cars within a time limit) events, as well as timed runs. The soundtrack is really nice because it suits the atmosphere of the game. What could possibly be better than speeding down the highway through the thick traffic while being chased by 3 heavily armored vehicles and listening to some classic music. The game has a pretty big and nice collection of classic tracks that I enjoy most. Anyway, if you're not really into racing games, but you do want to play something like that - Burnout it is.10/10 ",310,62,8,27,25,2,21

												As someone who loves racing games, this one just never clicked for me. I sunk a good 50 hours into it back in the day on console and it was just okay back then. Any way you slice it, it is easily the worst of all the Burnout games (it's a shame the better games never made their way onto Steam). While a bit disappointing, Paradise was still a solid game at it's time, but it simply hasn't aged well. The city is bland, the cars handle very poorly and the takedown system gets really annoying over time. It seems we've had a deluge of open world racing games since this one launched, and with the exception of NFS Rivals, I'd say all of them are superior to Paradise in one way or another. Even The Crew, despite suffering dreadful gameplay, has a much more vivid and engaging world than Paradise. Not that this is a bad game, it's just the weakest in the series, below par when compared to more recent open-world racers, and for me, the “ultimate” kicker that turns this from a “buy during a steam sale” into a “no way”, is the fact that the game is blatantly falsely advertised. What EA meant by ultimate is a mystery seeing as it does not contain the DLC. Big Surf island, the most important piece of DLC released was never even ported to PC, and the rest of the DLC you have to purchase through Origin. How exactly is that “The Ultimate” edition?

+ Ridiculously fast crazy gameplay+ Lots of cars to unlock and use+ Very large open-world map to explore and race on+ No GPS navigation, so you are forced to plot your own course in races+ Plenty of events+ Takedown mode is extremely fun+ Great Soundtrack with a variety of pop / rock (~100 songs total)+ Great damage physics- Missing something that made previous Burnouts great like Crash Mode- Most all the races take place in a urban / city environment, wish there was more rural races and perhaps some different weather- Can get a bit repetitive quickly- Some events drag on a bit too long even after you completed the goal- lacks a story- no upgrade system, currency, and the progession is kind of slow (you basically just win events to upgrade your license to unlock better cars to race in faster events)[Side Note: most of my time played was through Origin, so it won't show I have much time on Steam]			",2904,1026,99,265,347,21,392

												I don't know what to say about this, it was half good and half bad but I can't pick the ""IDK"" rating to this. I liked the soundtrack, quality and cars on this game. My dislikes are bikes, crappy controls at the start (I wouldn't have problems if I changed them to Valve-like later. Oh and, after a few tries it's not a bad thing), takes too long to get into my destination and I don't even know where to go and I screw up (but then I realized there's ""Easydrive""), I can't hear a such THING when I have every sound level the highest of my game (I don't want to have more than 10% volume, because then I would be ear♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by a Microphone beep/voices or Steam message/online sounds. But then it's normal...) and no crashbreaker on Showtime or it's not like a Crash mode anyways. The showtime is like the recent game ""Burnout CRASH!"" with infinite Aftertouch function instead of Crashbreaker and it ends only when you run out of boost and your car stops. Also why are the records so impressive (minimum a million dollars) on this mode?Another problem is that unfortunately Electronic Arts has abandoned the in-game Burnout Store, which makes it impossible to buy the rest of this game's DLC (Cops and Robbers, Toys, etc.) unless someone knows how to use Amazon. They are still purchasable on Xbox 360 however.There's also a DJ guy that talks random♥♥♥♥♥♥between music tracks and tells the objective of many races/events, just like in Burnout 3, except this is totally not our beloved Stryker but that ♥♥♥♥er named ""DJ Atomika"" from the SSX series. Didn't you know that Stryker already has a job as a DJ for KROQ-FM and he was sent to EA Studios as a guest for just one time? It's not like he's gonna be a Crash FM DJ for every single game for the Burnout series, but still, he was the best in my opinion.Don't know about you, but it personally looks like Rockstar Games' Midnight Club with a few of Need for Speed's functions slapped on. Overall 6.4/10. Although earlier I was like a ""♥♥♥♥♥ZOMFG DIS GAEM IZ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-1/10 MAEK BORNOWT TREE ON STIM!!11"" guy, but then it was my first time playing...			",44,3,5,0,1,2,2

												Do not mind my lack of hours i have Burnout:Paradise on my Playstation3 and i played it alot more than i have on PC !Pros- Decent graphics - AI Traffic isnt a pain in the crack- Map is well designed - The car's look very good in my opinion - The game didnt crash once neither encountered any bugs or glitches - Collectables are well scatered and some are kinda tricky to reach- You can actully free roam in a full Burnout CityCons- Very few people play online- Radio aint so good- I find drifting very hard in this game using keyboard- Very few customisation ( only paint )- The guy talking over the radio annoys me ....But over all i would recommend this game for burnour fans , it is on the best titles Burnout has ever released , but it kinda sucks that they stopped taking care of the game :/I would give it a 7/10  ",193,30,7,20,25,3,15

												Still the best racing game ever!Critereon Games single-handedly deliver the fastest, most intense racing thrills in gaming, and Burnout Paradise remains their greatest installment. The sense of speed is riveting, and each vehicle has a distinct, believable handling that allows for strategic use for the vast array of events. The visuals are still nice, though the car models look FAR better than the admittedly dull and flat environments. It's not a demanding title, either, as I am playing on an Asus laptop with a dual-core i7 Skylake, 12GB ram, and a measly Nvidia 940M with 2GB DDR3 VRAM, and the only settting I need to dial back is ambient occlusion. If there is one complaint I have it's that the soundtrack is awful. Truly awful. But the crashes are sick, so I'm a happy camper. 9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Utimate Box is a lie. There's clearly DLC installed that is hidden behind a paywall. This is terrible in and of itself. But, to add insult to injury you dannot buy the DLC as the burnout store is unavailible. So the game taunts you with content that is installed, but not accessable. And a lot of it looks really cool.The gameplay is fun. It is a fun experience. But, the fact theat the DLC isn't included in the ""ultimate"" experience, and that it is flat out unobtainable is beyond silly.			",122,24,2,15,19,0,8

												""Take me down To the Paradise City where the sign is green and the cars are pretty. I want you please, take me home!""(The play hours are low because this is my second purchase of the game after my first physical copy was broken [and the last installed game were removed long time ago] and I felt I wanted to be a bit nostalgic after I saw the Steam discount).So, Burnout Paradise is essentially a Burnout game, but with open world areas that become an ultimate playground of destruction. I essentially love this games and I wanna describe it in some form of pros and cons:Pros:- OPEN WORLD, BABY! This is what many Burnout fans wanted for a long time!- Vehicles variety. Besides a bunch of muscle cars, sports cars, super cars, and track cars, there are many everyday cars to choose from. You want to drive a sedan? You got it! Want to fool around in a van? There, have some awesome van! Want to haul your family in a station wagon? We got that for you!- Rewarding activities. Besides racing, road rage, stunt run, burning routes, and marked man, you can have plenty of side activities that sure are rewarding! form smashing billboards and gates, stunt jump, beating record time on certain streets, and also, my favourite, showtime! Which will be explained on the next point.- SHOWTIME! It's basically a good ol' crash event since Burnout 3, but there are no Crashbreaker. You use your boost to lift your car and move it around. Hitting traffic will refill your boost, and the best part is? YOU CAN ACTUALLY HAVE UNLIMITED SPACE TO DO YOUR SHOWTIME! You can basically start a Showtime at E. Crawford Dr. and end up with your boost tank empty at the South Bay Expressway, which is from north point of Paradise to the south point of it!- Diverse driving physics. Every cars in the game handles differently, which is a plus point for added realism. For example, when you drive the Carson 500GT, The car handles very slippery and each time you gas it, the rear tire will turn vigorously. But, when you drive cars like Carson Grand Marais, it handles like a boat. Hard to steer, and require e-brake to turn it sharply.- Day and night cycle. YES! There's finally a day and night cycle for thhis game, and it's a plus point for it!Cons:- Racing. What is lacking from the racing segment of the game is that you can only have point-to-point race in this game, There is no circuit mode which I kinda missed from the previous Burnout game.- Paintjob. Ugh. I pretty much dislike paintjobs on certain cars in the game. Wish there is an option to choose ""no-paintjob"" in certain vehicles.- Traffic variety. Many of us know that there were semi truck, industrial trucks, and RVs in the game. But unfortunately, these were cut content, and it's a shame that they were cut them. It adds plenty of realism if those were added (and also adds plenty vehicles to wreck in Showtime mode).Overall, it's a great game, alhough there are some lackings, but those are covered with the pros that given.

												I got so many mixed feelings about this game.I love racing games but I kinda hate it if they turn out to be a chore to finish them..I'll be short and simple on this.pros:-Very nice set of cars.-Great physics and animations.-Some times the car damage after crashes is impressive and the crash effects are very cool -Couple of nice mechanisms including auto repair and auto nitro-fill stations during races-Free roam map-Graphics are totally ok for its time of release.-Nice music selections.cons:-The way the races are set on the map; totally like a NFS Underground 2 ripoff -Annoyingly repetitive; once you level up during the game you got to re-run 90% of the races on the map with just a +10% of extra new race points all over.-Hard to get through if you are not too good with racing games; constant random traffic that makes you wreck your car way to easy even if you are 5 meters away from finish.-Respawn, cut scene, crash cinematics cannot be skipped, you lose like more than 5% of your gameplay time for no reason.-They totally ruin the fun of the game with the whole aggresive racing idea; i got more stressed than mentally rewarded after playing this.average:it's worth playing, the price is low anyway and you can get it cheaper during special offers. don't keep your expectations too high and enjoy the ride. don't buy this unless you are a hardcore racing games fanatic.

												One of the better racing games I've played on steam, despite some serious flaws.What it is:- All races played in the overworld- Traffic is present- No car upgrades, customization, or tuning- Car handling is arcade, not simulation- Several game modes, but only two (race and stunt) are worth playing- Most time is spent driving, not in menus- Exploration and finding secret sortcuts plays a big partCons:- Unskippable crash cam gets very annoying very quickly- No way to instantly restart a race. If you want to retry a race YOU MUST DRIVE BACK TO THE STARTING LINE.- Repairing your car or switching cars between races requires driving to a repair shop or junkyard, which is extremely tedious.- The menus are incredibly unintuitive (I had to google search to figure out how to quit the game and how to quit an event)Pros:- Exploration and finding secrets is really rewarding- The stunts are just awesome- Car handling is good- It is fun, despite the cons.

												The gameplay is incredibly arcady. It's nothing like other racing games. It's really fun cruising around with your buddy around Paradise city but other than that the game didn't really hold on to me. I guess some people may enjoy it but I think that it isn't actually an amazing game. It's more of a game you play when you don't have nothing better to do and you've got time to waste. If you like arcady driving controls then this is a must get, if you are a fan of need for speed or forza or grand turismo first try this game before buying it. It's not really for everyone. And if you decide to play it don't judge it rashly, because the driving is really diffrent then in other games, you gotta let it sink in. Oh and graphicly this game being that it's from 2009 is bloody amazing.TL;DR: If you don't like arcade racing games don't get it but try it, if you like arcade racing games get it. NOW!

												Honestly, I just find this game boring. It's not challenging. ""Here's a race, just drive down this straight road. Oh, great, you've done it! Here's a new car!"" Seriously? Even with a B-licence greatest challenge is not to miss a road during a race, which happens way too easy, because the mini-map doesn't rotate in your driving-direction. But even when you take the wrong exit you can still win the race, because your opponents are pretty slow. So just drive on, if you get totally lost, there's a way to restart the race anyway. Even though you can't win anymore (2nd place doesn't count), you have to finish. Then drive back and start again. The open-world-A-to-B-races just make you take the easiest (straight) road again and again. Because they work. Looking for a cool shortcut? Trying another route? Way to risky. Trying to break through a wooden fence may be succesfull... or end in a boring, unskippable slow-mo-crash-sequence. And not every crossing on the map is really one, because the road-height-levels aren't displayed.There are good things about this game. The world is nice, many things to ""collect"", great soundtrack. But for me there was nothing motivating.  I tried several times to find something. Something challenging. Mostly I left the game after about 30 minutes, because I couldn't find it. I guess I'll go back to NFS Most Wanted (2005) again...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So I should start out with saying something nice. My three year old absolutely adores this game, and consequently we've played it quite a lot. This is his first experience with the series, it may well be my last. He has no concept of how many aspects of the series were sacrificed in the insane pursuit of an 'open-world' approach to racing games. He will perhaps never grasp how hollow every aspect of the game now appears in the light of a proceedurally-based sunrise, from the crashes, to the super jumps, to the minor variations on 3 routes that win all the races, to the billboards the game begs you to smash, defiling it's own logo OVER and OVER and OVER, as if the developers were working through some emotional issues. If the obvious cover-up done on the Van's paintjob is any indication, it was a cukolding experience for them. Oh, Criterion, remember when you were making Burnout 2 and Black? What led you to blue barrels and yellow construction signs acting as surrogate blues clues for toddlers?In any case, by 'Ultimate Box' what EA meant to say was ""Box full of DLC for you to pay for"", as this content isn't even Downloaded, it came with the game, you just have to pay to use it. That's right, there are several packages of cars just waiting to be unlocked for extra money, including the hovercraft delorean which makes every other car in the game seem lame. Oh wait, it's not actually a delorean, because EA had to slavishly rip off a bunch of brands without accrediting them. The car that looks like a Bel-Air has freakish air-time, making it the only candidate for completion of several achievements/unlocks. And they put motorcycles in this game, probably to taunt you with how much you can taste an awesome Road Rash remake, but rest assured it's completely neutered, uninspired, and honestly looks like they just walked away before they got anywhere with that particular aspect of the game.

												Racing is my favorite sport, and my favorite genre of games, hands down. If you are looking for a simulation racing experience, this is without a doubt NOT the game for you. However, this is one of the most fun arcade-style racing experiences I have ever had. The crash physics are some of the best ever seen to this very day, the racing is intense and challenging, there are plenty of small missions to do all around Paradise City, and the cars (while heavily inspired by actual vehicles) are all pretty unique in their own way. Not to mention that it can run on just about any PC made after 2005. If you want a fun, crazy, and simple racing game, this is a must have.			",73,3,9,6,11,0,3

												Ah, burnout, one of my favorite game series as a kid. Unfortunately, this is the last one made and I doubt there will be any more burnout games after this, onto the point...I have played through this game twice or close to it before aquiring a steam copy. Gameplay and Mechanic wise it resembles almost every other burnout game before it, with some new features and a new GFX engine. The main difference between all the other burnouts though, is that this one is free roam, and you can actually take your own routes to win a race if neccessary.All-in-all, this game will be well worth your money. Even more so if you bought the EA Humble Bundle, which is what I did. As far as burnout games go this is the best one right next to Burnout Revenge.			",121,13,9,4,6,0,12

												Burnout has traditionally been a series of incredibly high-speed races where you race to the finish line, while destroying your opponents cars in a sweet, satisfying, firey spectacle.Paradise does this, but it adds a few more game modes, and an open-world concept.This game is an example of open-world done in the wrong way. Essentially, the driving around that you do in the open world is not particularly fun. There is not much to do, and you are only doing it to get to the next event. All of the Burnout appeal mentioned in the first sentence of this review is completely absent when driving around on the open world streets.So, while the game still has the fun Burnout experience, it is watered down with tons and tons of filler.6/10 ""Okay""			",97,38,1,24,4,3,12

The entire theme is an open world grindfest to level up your licence  and get better cars. Had a feel of the driver games without any pesky police to bother you.  The crash cinematic's are absolutely gorgeous, and make me want to take those extreme jumps , just to see if I can wreck my car even more spectacularly than last time.

												The classic arcade drifting and turbo-boosting racing that made the Burnout series famous, except now in a totally wide open city sandbox playground. The city itself feels like one of those Hot Wheels playsets instead of a grid of interlocking streets with railings everywhere. Expect to be driving across rooftops, through airfields and off of dams and seeing some of the best car deforming crashes that are only rivaled by a few other racers. The car selection is especially varied, even for a Burnout game, forget dodging traffic when your bigass 4x4 just knocks them away. The soundtrack, predictably, is both lame, and catchy. Classic Burnout right there.+Classic Burnout IN A SANDBOX+Totally drivable city/countryside+Diverse car selection+Trademark crashing physics with a new Driveway system-DJ Atomica-Google has perfected Driverless cars-Does not include The IslandNote: Download the Paradise Vanity pack to have access to the DLC content that was never released on PC, such as Big Surf Island, as well as other bonus features.

												Burnout has traditionally been a series of incredibly high-speed races where you race to the finish line, while destroying your opponents cars in a sweet, satisfying, firey spectacle.Paradise does this, but it adds a few more game modes, and an open-world concept.This game is an example of open-world done in the wrong way. Essentially, the driving around that you do in the open world is not particularly fun. There is not much to do, and you are only doing it to get to the next event. All of the Burnout appeal mentioned in the first sentence of this review is completely absent when driving around on the open world streets.So, while the game still has the fun Burnout experience, it is watered down with tons and tons of filler.6/10 ""Okay""			",97,38,1,24,4,3,12

												Racing is my favorite sport, and my favorite genre of games, hands down. If you are looking for a simulation racing experience, this is without a doubt NOT the game for you. However, this is one of the most fun arcade-style racing experiences I have ever had. The crash physics are some of the best ever seen to this very day, the racing is intense and challenging, there are plenty of small missions to do all around Paradise City, and the cars (while heavily inspired by actual vehicles) are all pretty unique in their own way. Not to mention that it can run on just about any PC made after 2005. If you want a fun, crazy, and simple racing game, this is a must have.			",73,3,9,6,11,0,3

The entire theme is an open world grindfest to level up your licence  and get better cars. Had a feel of the driver games without any pesky police to bother you.  The crash cinematic's are absolutely gorgeous, and make me want to take those extreme jumps , just to see if I can wreck my car even more spectacularly than last time.

												I really liked the original burnout games on Gamecube and I have fond memories of playing them with my older brothers.By contrast, this game felt half finished.  The graphics were a let down.  Even the handling and physics of the vehicles felt poor.  Whilst expecting Gran Turismo mechanics would be absurd, this game tries to mask its laziness behind arcade-y-ness. I vote to pass on this title.			",242,61,10,29,32,0,23

												One of the best arcade style racing games of this generation. Much better than Need for Speed. Burnout Paradise takes from previous Burnout titles the insane speed, and emphasis on wreck or be wrecked style of racing that has been cloned now in several other arcade racing titles. But nobody can do it better than Burnout. What Paradise adds over previous Burnout titles is an open world hub to race around in be it on 4 wheels, or now on 2 wheels with the addition of motorcycles. Open world gameplay adds a new spin on progression, as expected, and also opens up point to point races in a whole new way. No more barriers. The other cars go left? You go right. Right to the finish line. Or right into a brick wall. Granted, this is still an EA title, so there are some annoyances. Lack of DLC over on the steam version being one. Also, poor update support. And on top of that, EA's signature annoying announcer, unskippable cutscenes, and a soundtrack that can not make it's mind up. Guns N Roses, Faith No More, Soundgarden? Nice! Avril Lavigne.....WHAT? Okay. Nitpicking the last few parts. But anyway, the ultimate box is quite nice for the price! I just wish I could buy DLC from steam.			",2651,995,119,316,348,31,451

												Having a free city to roll around in has been quite the staple in the Need for Speed series. Now it's Burnout's turn. Does causing automobile mayhem in a free roaming genre work well?The graphics in the game can be pretty impressive if you have the computer setup that's powerful enough to run, say, any Crysis game. You'll start to wonder if it's even possible to walk the streets of Paradise City without freaking out over the passing traffic and catch a glimpse of the rowdy, wreckless cars smashing each other up. Beautiful scratches and traded paints between every crash and takedown marked on each car!The library of music for the game is a mix of top past rock, metal and remix hits for shredding through the streets, along with some orchestral classics for when you need to wind down and soak in the view of the city. However, if you had to classify them separately, then there's not a lot for the soundtrack. And depending on how many times you wanted to re-launch the game, you'll start to wonder if Guns N' Roses' ""Paradise City"" is worth having in your head for ages to come.The controls leave a little to be desired, while some features in variety, such as the way boosts are used in different classes of vehicles (bringing back the classic or using it if desired for stunt-specific purposes), others can get a more Need for Speed feel with the controls. At the very least, you can still get some air and maintain a drift well enough to keep up with the competition. And of course, there's no limits to how rowdy you can get with other opponents. Because the game now goes free-roam, you'll have to navigate yourself to each point in the city. There are no invisible walls or navigational lines on your radar to aid you to the finish line, apart from your vehicle signaling and the street signs blinking on the screen telling you where to turn next.When playing online, the system requirements stretch beyond further than what is recommended because of multiple players racing everywhere across the city. So your computer will need a boost in hardware or reduction in graphics settings in that area.To all the Crash enthusiasts, you'll find no such tradition in this free-roaming pot-stirrer. Instead, all realism and logic gets thrown out the window and you can now throw your vehicle around everywhere, wrecking the poor victims driving across the streets of Paradise City in Showtime Mode.If you need a more real-time competitive edge by mixing together Need for Speed and Burnout, you've definitely found your game here. But abandoning the roots that the franchise has once made itself famous for can be a big, risky trade-off not only for its stapled name, but also for its player-base.			",393,92,24,34,29,5,37

												Having a free city to roll around in has been quite the staple in the Need for Speed series. Now it's Burnout's turn. Does causing automobile mayhem in a free roaming genre work well?The graphics in the game can be pretty impressive if you have the computer setup that's powerful enough to run, say, any Crysis game. You'll start to wonder if it's even possible to walk the streets of Paradise City without freaking out over the passing traffic and catch a glimpse of the rowdy, wreckless cars smashing each other up.

												This game has a very weird combination of Open World and Racing Game, although the two very rarley go hand in hand, Burnout Paradise pulls it off. At just about every stoplight in the game there is some kind of event, wether it be a race, demolition derby, etc. they are always well made and well executed. The way you progress through the game is by getting wins and upgrading you ""license"" this unlocks new cars/bikes and your ""licence"" looks pretty too! This is one of the best racing games i've played and I liked it! Pro Tip: Keyboards suck for racing games your better off with a controller or some kind of analog input..			",239,36,4,31,36,2,42

												Runs insanely well, no framerate drops whatsoever. Graphical fidelity is really pushed back because of this and as a result doesn't look too great (even for 2008). Gameplay is incredibly fast and satisfying, though unlocking other vehicles can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Overall recommended.			",407,70,7,32,19,3,24

												Looking for a decent Racing game?Pros: Awesome cars and bikes, still an excelent game regardless of being kind of old.Good graphics, the detail on the vehicles are incredible. Tons of achievements, races, cars, and the music the radio plays while you drive is such a large amount of good soundtracks that will make your ride much better.Cons: There are only like 4 different motorcycles and thats not cool.Game is repetitive and playing it often can cause some boring issues.You can´t play it offline, and that's terrific if you want to play single player, need to be online on steam.

												As a burnout fan of old i must say i was dissapointed with this outing. Dont get me wrong, whats not to like with loads of cars and bikes at your disposal while free roaming a large city, its just the game was already good enough to forgo them so came across to me anyway as a failed attempt to re-ignite our passion while competing with the likes of need for speed so as to gain new followers.That said its still fun, just not as much as games of old in the series so if your not into emulators, then 5 quid is a small price to pay for a bit of good old arcade drive, jump and smash.

												Burnout Paradise is an arcade racing game, where you have the freedom to choose your route. You can play multiple types of events such as Road Rage or Marked Man. It doesn't matter which event do you play, you can race on your favorite route, just like free-roaming, your route will lead you to the victory. This game has many cars, you cannot tune them, you just can change their paintjob, the city is full of stunts and some hidden areas. The multiplayer is almost dead because nobody plays this game anymore. The soundtrack is kinda good, it even has classical music. Even if its called ""The Ultimate Box"" you will get only the Motorcycles DLC, and the other DLCs cannot be bought because the store is dead, so you cannot get the other DLCs. But anyway, even if this game is old and nobody plays it anymore, this game is a must-have for the collectors.			",26,0,1,3,2,1,1

												The open world killed the serie for me. It's not about shortcuts, crashes and take down anymore. It's about pausing the game every 10 sec to look at the map. Plus the minimap doesn't rotate so you end up going the wrong way and losing the race. Then you have to drive back to the start of the race because it's an open world game and you can't just hit restart to restart the race. Same thing when you want to change car. You have to drive to one of the junkyard. I wish there was a ""fast travel"" thing.Driving and jumping around in the city is fun thought. And the music is great.It's a shame they went the open world way. Burnout 3 was so much fun.If you you're looking for something like Burnout 3, I suggest you pick up Need For Speed Hot Pursuit. It's made by Criterion and it kinda feels like burnout 3 (minus the crashes).			",211,42,15,24,26,5,23

												Looking for a game to race, crash other cars and make awesome stunts?This is the game for you.Burnout Paradise is a fun freeroam racing game that never gets boring. The challenges get harder and there are alot of cars to unlock. When you have completed the game for a full 100%, you still won't be bored when redoing the challenges.			",702,203,36,67,119,13,93

												This game is pretty good, though in my book it takes third-best Burnout game behind Dominator and Revenge. The open world is nicely scaled, not being too large or too small, and the unlockable cars give this game a reason to be played for 20+ hours. Just make sure to not delete then reinstall the game, otherwise your progress will be wiped. By the way, you should get this game for your Xbox or Playstation, as both of those contain more DLC than this version does.			",35,2,9,1,2,0,0

The multiplayer just sucks and is quite dead. The DLC (Ultimate Box) doesn't actually work without some additional hackery thanks to EA abandoning this game. It's a shame Burnout 4 didnt get remastered for PC. I miss the crash mode especially.			",500,122,11,54,26,6,76

												This is easily one of the best, if not the best street racing game that I've ever played.It has excellent car detail and crash physics for its time, and promises hours upon hours of gameplay with new events at every corner. This product automatically comes with the Motorbike DLC from the Burnout Store, so that's an added plus for additional content.I just wish this game was integrated into Steam more, such as mirroring the in-game achievements with Steam Achievements, making the DLCs puchasable though the Steam Store, and adding Steam Trading Cards.Other than the separation from Steam-exclusive features, this game will always be at the top of my list for racing games.

												So the game mechanics hold up, and the gameplay is pretty fun, until you get your class A liscence and every other car becomes OP while your car suddenly has the crappiest handling ever. However, there is some EA ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t inthis game. Thankfully no origin is needed, however there's product placement everywhere and the menu system is intentionally terrible just to force you to lok at dlc you can't even buy. I have to admit though, there's nothing better than watching a crumpled car fly through the air in slow motion from the optimal camera angle. The only other problem i have with this game is the way you can clearly see no one is in any of the cars. I want gore dammit!			",122,14,5,5,12,3,7

Online is no longer supported. (However, EA still requires origin account to log in and play the game. WHY? I wish my butt hair can tell me.This game is not a racing game, is a crushing simulater.

												The open world killed the serie for me. It's not about shortcuts, crashes and take down anymore. It's about pausing the game every 10 sec to look at the map. Plus the minimap doesn't rotate so you end up going the wrong way and losing the race. Then you have to drive back to the start of the race because it's an open world game and you can't just hit restart to restart the race. Same thing when you want to change car. You have to drive to one of the junkyard. I wish there was a ""fast travel"" thing.Driving and jumping around in the city is fun thought. And the music is great.It's a shame they went the open world way. Burnout 3 was so much fun.If you you're looking for something like Burnout 3, I suggest you pick up Need For Speed Hot Pursuit. It's made by Criterion and it kinda feels like burnout 3 (minus the crashes).			",211,42,15,24,26,5,23

												I thought this game would be fun, after having played Burnout Takedown and Burnout 3 for hundreds o f hours on PS2.I was dead wrong. This is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and here's why:-The bull♥♥♥♥ navigation system.                   A small road sign flashes for 1,5 seconds on the top of the screen to indicate which turn at each intersection you need to take, and this is absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  You can have no idea what kind of turn to expect without taking your eyes off the road and looking at the map, and you crash when you do this.-The bull♥♥♥♥ shortcuts. Are you winning? Are you in first place? Have you taken a shortcut in the last three seconds? Well then say hello to last place my friend! Enjoy your time in the last place while the game gives you very helpful directions like ""Exit"" and ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t Avenue"", all the while everyone else finishes the race and you drive around the map for fifteen minutes, unable to restart the race.-The bull♥♥♥♥ EA & Origin account system.Want to play online? You need to get an account. But wait, there's already an account with that e-mail. Got your e-mail but you forgot your Origin ID? You need to go f**k yourself. You miraculously have a functioning Origin ID? Here, enjoy the nonfunctional Burnout servers that we forced you to set up an account for!-The bull♥♥♥♥ damage system.Remember when Burnout had a decent damage system on the PS2? The days when a damaged car handled differently? It's like that, only this time damage has absolutley no effect on gameplay, and is purely estethic.-The bull♥♥♥♥ music. If you expect good, mood-setting, ""road trip"" songs, well you can go f**k yourself. Enjoy generic, boring music. The game has ONE song, and that is Paradise City by Guns'n Roses.2/10 would not recommend			",346,93,14,18,28,3,37

												The Good:+ It looks a little bit better than the console versions.+ Mods.+ Runs great on 3rd world computers if you're stuck in a situation like that.+ I used the picture of Goatse as my crash-cam.The Bad:- Music is fucking awful. Whoever said this game has a good soundtrack is either tone deaf, or they have terminal-stage taste cancer. Whoever thought Avril Lavine would make a great addition to a racing game's soundtrack, should be shot.- No support for custom soundtracks. (Muting in-game music and running FooBar in the background is your best alternative).- Car customization is rudimentary at best.- Controller support leaves a lot to be desired. And by ""a lot to be desired"" I actually mean ""make this fucking shit work Criterion!""- Netcode is spotty. I was experience massive delay and lag spikes in a cross-region match (West Coast to Mid-West). Don't even think about doing international matches. - Barebones graphical options. Very basic, they only offer resolution, vsync, texture quality, AA levels, and I think SSAO. There is motion blur in there, but most of you will turn that off. - Advertisements are not updated. Burger King has been open past midnight for quite awhile now. In fact, they just begun location tests to measure how well 24 hr of operation fares. - It gets old after playing it for an hour or so. Then you realize how shallow this game was, with the feeling of regret setting in because you wasted over 100 hours playing this game 7 years ago.- Not enough blood or naked women.Conclusion:I had good fun playing the game back in 2009. Believe me, I platinumed the PS3 version and got 800~ gamerscore on the Heatbox 360 version. But at the end of the day, you realize this was a soulless game with an empty world that consisted of narrows paths that you are allowed to traverse on. You realize that the state of the racing genre is in despair, where arcade racers have regressed to the level of Burnout Paradise, and Sim Racers are struggling to keep away from the corporate-project driven stench that EA's anus has bestowed upon their two most popular racing franchises.Final score:3/10. It's over-hyped medicore bullshit; only buy it when it's on a Steam sale.

												As much as I want to like this game, well I do, but I can't recomend it because yet again we have a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ization from EA. Usually when a game has a subtitle like ""The Ultimate Box"" you expect it to come with all the DLC, yeah EA doesn't think so. After the store going down with no sign of any support whatsoever you literally have to mod your way to the ""ultimate box content"" thanks EA! Don't like the music? tough♥♥♥♥♥♥ you don't get the custom music playlist like consoles do either, even though it could be settled with a simple patch. if you don't want to play music in the background on an external app and would rather have your music dynamic to the ingame effects the only thing you can do is change the song files in the most ridiculous way I've ever seen and done, also the only possible way, which didn't matter because after 2 hours of doing this it only rendered my game into an unplayable mess(simple audio files did this), thanks again EA! Lets not forget the obnoxious popup menus that you'll be greeted with every single time you launch the game begging you to use it's unnecessary social account, because that sure doesn't get tiring after the umpteenth time of launching to play.So as good as this game actually is as you'll see from the more positive reviews, I can't recomend it because EA got their ♥♥♥♥ing hands on it.""Becuase remember; at EA we don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about what the gamers want, we've already choked this game dry of every penny and moved on.♥♥♥♥ the developerAnd ♥♥♥♥ you"" <3Want my advice, save yourself the trouble and go buy Burnout 3 or Revenge			",61,9,2,9,5,1,9

This game looks pretty awsome and it probably is but EA is obviously too big to worry about the few so to date thats at least 5 titles theve missed out on. Sorry crap review but this situation has left me a little frustrated to say the least.Hmm seams they have a new security system in place now which possibly means i could trust buying products on origin again iv`e changed passwords n stuff but still i think i need some sorta acknowledgement one way or the other well i`ll see if i can at least get that! if i can`t then F%ck em.

												I LOVED Burnout series, started with Burnout, then Burnout 2 (Still the best hyper-realistic racing game i have EVER played)Burnout 3 was even better. Insanity. a lot of fun. i have nothing but the best memories of these games.This is NOTHING like those. Its Terrible. Disugusting. It fills me with aimless hatred. I want to vomit all over myself in hopes of feeling better.After sitting through far too much cutscene (forced to watch cutscenes explaining how to use an accelerator.) I drove around for a few minutes but kept getting interrupted by events, cutscenes, messages... I could not actually play the game it seemed. Alt+f4 coz the menus are crap. where are the game settings? where is the damn options button at all? exit button? I had to search online to find out how coz the game itself does not say.To get to the games config i was forced to go through the burnout store, listing a large amount of possibly great products that cannot be purchased because EA poo'd their pants with this one.Ultimate box??? NONE of the DLC included. The game is a Burnout Title, so i was expecting a burnout game. This is not a Burnout game.Fvk this game, fvk EA, Im going out to find some hoodrats who want bare knuckles, then im going to lose on purpose in hopes of a concussion that will cause memory loss so i can be free of all memory of this steaming pile of dog shiz.

												-Why all EA games have these unskippable pandering self hyping cutscenes?+The driving part was decent, i personally liked the street names on top, it really adds to game.+Minimap was good looking clear and crisp enough, nice zoom distance compared to the most recent racing games i played.-Game was made for short attention spam casuals, is has to completely stop the game to tell you how to do stuff. (and it failed to do that)-Music was loud and obnoxious, i missed an explanation and there was no subtitles or popups, the only information on the screen was [A] to accelerate at the beginning, no information about breaking, reversing, starting the events or anything. I am not a console player with 12 placed buttons, i have an entire keyboard to verify each keybind or navigate all the way to the options menu to check them. And what's up with these default keys? What the hell? Even freaking Rocket League has better default keys than this.-The narrator voice gave me an urge to uninstall the game, and the game is not compelling nor intuitive overall.Disclaimer: Cinematic self hyping cutscenes makes me preemtively hate the game, and the fact it is an EA game.Edit: good review links down below:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197978315820/recommended/24740/http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198029266683/recommended/24740/ ",152,6,5,9,6,0,10

												   I debated with myself for a long time to buy this game. My favourite game is TF2. It was a really fun game to just mess around in. I could lobby up with friends and have a really good time. After TF2 updated and became an unpolished overwatch, I decided I needed a good game to play while I decided what to play next. I heard about Burnout Paradise and how it was a racing game with a well made open world. That peaked my interest. I looked at the store page and some reviews online and it looked like fun, and for only £10! I had high expectations for this game, considering it is supposed to replace my favourite game for a while, and it blew all of those expectations out of the water!   It is a game that is engaging from the start. After you get your first car, you quickly get your second, and then the upgraded version of it, and then your licence gets upgraded. It also gives you a wide variety of cars to suit any drving style, whether you like taking down your opponents to finish in first or just driving around the densely packed open world trying to pull off the coolest stunt. After starting off with about 3 events, I often just find myself driving passed the next one I planned on going to and just drove around for the next half an hour.   The only problem that I have for this game is that the data doesn't sync to the steam cloud, but that is only a problem if you are going to be playing this game on multiple computers. This is my first introduction to the Burnout series and I am hooked. I hope to be coming back to play the other games in the series!			",105,24,3,7,11,1,7

												Remember how electrifying and exciting it was to play Burnout 3? Cool, right? Well, move on, because you won't find any of those good feelings here on this game. The city is kinda boring, no story - I don't remember any plot in any other Burnout game, but still -  Driving the car is not so good as it was when you drive any car in , the drivability it's pretty close to any recent Need for Speed. No fast travel and you can't set any navigation point on the map, so when you wanna change your car, you need to check the map and drive to the garage on this boring city. This game doesn't have any achievements, so I won't even waste my time with it. I'm happy I got this game in a bundle, and didn't waste money with it. I tried this game for 3 times in the last two years and still it didn't change my mind.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a pretty awesome game. I especially love the motorbikes and how the riding mechanics are applied to both bikes and cars. If you set the music -sound down to 0 and raise the vehicle sound and find a bike then you will hear a beautiful sound screaming from the beginning to the end of your ride.Just love to ride a bike in burnout paradise. I have to play the game alone because i make a funny face when im gaming this game.... it's almost like i'm getting an ♥♥♥♥♥♥ from sex. I recommend this game without any doubts.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Awful! This game is nothing like the Burnout I remember. It is really lame and I'll tell you why. Also, the game is called ""The Ultimate Box"" but it features NO DLC! It was the same price on Origin, and it would have DLC. The soundtrack of the game ain't bad at all, I actually picked up on quite a few songs. The big problem is the racing. I wonder who came up with the bright idea of a race in the open world. I don't know. The game is not amazing. Watch IGN's review, for the first time I geuss they are really credible.

The difficulty is perfect, it's challenging, but not too hard. If I had to nitpick I'd say one of the game modes is overly repetetive and the menus are awkward to navigate.8/10			",332,112,13,20,21,4,33

												Back in the all too distant past at university a guy on my corridor had one of the burnout games which featured an amazingly fun looking mode where you had you cause as much damage as possible by crashing into an intersection and that is why I bought this game. Much to my disappointment the equivalent mode in this game just wasn't that great. You just start a crash on any stretch of road with limited degree of control and all the cars swerve towards you until you reach a required target. The older version was more like a puzzle to solve with a fixed arrangement of traffic.That was only the start of the disappointment, the biggest problem is with the phrase “Ultimate Box”. When a game proclaims to be a superlative edition my expectation is that it is the base game combined with all the available DLC but no this is the base game with the free updates only. When you try and access the DLC it takes you to a store front that no longer works and they are not available on Steam either. There are apparently ways to buy the DLC but I didn't like the core game enough to want to investigate this option.The actual game continued to disappoint me. The game has an open world environment however the actual races all end in a small number of locations making all the races seem unnecessarily similar. The races do not follow any fixed route but the navigation system is terrible, you have a compass that shows you the overall direction to the finish but the only clue about which road to take  is a little road sign that pops up too late to make the turn in the faster cars. There is also a mini map but looking at that is a sure fire way to crash into something so effectively you just have to learn the map. The game progression is too unfocused for me, you just complete an arbitrary number of races to unlock the next licence. Also there is no option to quit or restart and event you have to complete the event and then drive all the way back to the start point.The other annoyance is all the collectables. I do love a nice set of collectable items in a game but this just has too many for it to work. There are 400 gates to smash through, there is no way you can collect all these while still having fun, you must just be driven by the desire for completion. You are bound to miss a few and then end up painstakingly going through a walktrhough revisiting all the locations till you find the ones you missed. And there is not just the gates there are jumps and best times on every road and biggest crashes on every road.One of the items of DLC that did come with the ultimate box was the multiplayer party DLC which was again (I keep coming back to this word) disappointing. It had no split screen options, the events are repetitive and the load times are just that bit too long so it starts getting aggravating as you are passing the controller between players.All of these problems are a real shame as the core game engine is excellent with great driving, spectacular crashing, a decent range of cars, a good map and variety of events. And in the sale this cost less than the price of a bus ticket. Given all the annoyances in the game I can't bring myself to recommend this game.			",128,95,10,4,4,1,8

												I was an Original Burnout, and Burnout 2 player for a Long time. When take downs came into play that hampered the thrill of street racing, and pulled the focus off the racing.  This game has really good graphics, phyisics, a wonderful feeling of speed in game, addictive play, good varity of roads and conditions, the feel and response of every vehicle is different and requires you to learn each one.  This game pays awesome tribute to the look and feel of what made Brunout Great, the open world is fun to race non stop throughout, the selections of challenges is large, but this game has a few features that Really get in the way of My enjoyment.  So much time is wasted in Cinematic moments, at jumps, at crashes, at take downs, at race beginings, at race endings, at paint shops, at repair shops, at gas stations, each time taking control of Your car away from You. All the time this causes me car to crash, or go down the wrong street... Changing the frequency, or turning that off would have helped so much...   I can't change the zoom on the minimap to actually use it, and moving through all the menus just to get to a useable map took a long time because even menu screens have a cinimatic effect, choosing a car has a cinimatic effect, and nothing could be skipped.  Open world also meant no restart buttons if you failed an event, so you have to back track to the starting point by yourself, and this ate a Lot of time.  If you can handle a world where the car never stops, and cinimatics leave  you without control of your vehicle often, the rest of this game is awesome. I still hope to learn some patience with it, and I have yet to test online play so I'm hoping that may help.  I LOVE open world racing games, but this one may not be the one for me.

												Burnout Paradise is a fantastic racing experience if you can get past: the occasionally frustraiting car physics, the limited soundtrack, the limited events, the repetitive racing sections, the need to hunt down events instead of transporting to them, the constant challenge hurrassment when your just trying to drive, the always annoying announcer who can't be shut up, the unskippable crash sequences that go on for minutes when you just want to get back to whatever you were doing, the late game cheating to make up for poor car AI...I put 7 hrs into this game, and I can't stand it anymore. A port of an old Burnout would be better than this, but this is all we got. Buy it on sale.			",536,96,7,62,32,4,88

												Really simple racing game. It has the normal gamemodes that you would have in a racing game (time trials, point to point race, lap race), it also has a demolition-derby-ish gamemode that consists in destroying the opponents in order to get points (as usual, the person with the most points wins).It has a great variety of vehicles like muscle cars, super cars, some bikes and much more IF you're willing to buy the available DLCs.The multiplayer is really cool and fun too. It has all the same gamemodes that you have in single-player. Definitely worth a try, but try to buy it on a sale.			",83,4,12,2,3,2,1

												I don't give many negative reviews, but in light of all overwhelming positives for this huge commercial game, I'll say my beef.Reeks of console port, no reconfigurable controls, music not to my liking, unskippable cutscenes, completely inability to talk to others online, infuriating menus, cluttered horrible console-esque hud, I'd rather boot up SAMP and play that for a driving game FFS. Why can't I say GG? Why can't I ask a question? How is a game supposed to have a community without a public chat function? I hate multiplayer games that let us play together but turn us into mutes.Perhaps worst, car physics feel floaty, unrealistic, and unlikable. You know when you got in the Buffalo or anothe RWD car in GTA: San Adreas, and the whole car buckled down upon acceleration as the rear wheels bit into the earth, giving a vague impression of a real car would act? This game has NONE OF THAT, it's floaty and terrible.			",301,42,6,21,20,1,53

												This game is a lot of fun but it has one really big thing wrong with it.  EA.Some time ago they thought it was a good idea to shut down the Burnout store making all the DLC unavailable and thus making this game not the ""Ultimate Box"".  The only way to get the DLC cars now is to buy a code off of Amazon for $5, but the code is an unlock everything code so I wouldn't recommend using it until you've unlocked at least most of the cars.However dispite of all this the game is still a whole lot of fun with and without friends.8/10			",142,12,2,6,2,0,3

												Forewarning, There is a severe LACK of advertised DLC in the game. Yes, you get motorcycles, but there is only four of them, and two you have to work towards, There is only the base Cars, and 2 online cars added in, and you cannot buy the DLC. So Basically, This isn't the ultimate box. If we could still get the DLC, somehow, then hell yeah, get this game, but otherwise, if you don't have many friends who want/have this game, Buy at your own discretion.This game is fun though.

												With out a doubt, this is hands down the most enjoyable driveing game. Turning the fictional Paradise City into your motor stomping ground, it acts as a racing, stunt, and derby game all in one beautiful area.

												8/10Amazing soundtrack.Nice graphics.Nice sounds: you feel the cars.Arcade playstyle, really fast and fun.A big (not too much) city full of events and points of interest to try stunts and new paths in order to win races.An important DLC is missing, don't know why it is not been released on PC.

												I am a very big fan of Burnout Series. I have played every single Burnout game except the first one and had a lot of fun. The last installment of Burnout series is Burnout Paradise and I love it. Freeroam mode is very good, new game modes etc. But if the game had the old modes like Drift, Maniac, Crash or Pursuit the game would be the best game of Burnout series.9/10 Worth its price.

												I just couldn't get this game to work properly with Windows 10 in Big Picture mode. As an arcade crash game, it would have been ideal for a bit of streaming via a Steam Link using the Steam Controller.However, the audio would continue, but the screen would randomly freeze in game.Several posts suggest using Windows 7 compatibility mode, that I couldn't figure out how to do through 'Big Picture'. In the end I'd spent a over 30 minutes on it, so I went for the refund. I just couldn't guarantee that is would work.If you still use Windows 7, then maybe this is a bargain in the sale. Otherwise it was too much hassle to get it running smoothly.I guess being an old game it was going to be hit and miss anyway.			",18,7,5,1,3,0,3

												Pretty fun racing game. Good events, racing, takedown, beat the clock, stunts. Love the variety of the cars and different functions of each. I didn't play much, while I do recommend it, it gets old fast. You play 10 hours, get most the cars and from there it's VERY repetitive. Similar events over & over. Couldn't imagine slogging it to 100%. If you get it for $5, you'll definitely get your money's worth.			",547,213,26,82,70,9,62

You want to just race? Go ahead! You want to smash into other cars and taking them out? Go ahead! You want to fly true the air at high speed and create the most epic jumps and stunts? Go ahead! I even enjoyed simply roaming around and discovering the world. And all of that with some great music playing in the background.If all of this sounds good to you then I highly recommend this game.

												This is such a fun game. It tests you in so many ways, and offers such an amazingly diversified open-world track. It sets itself apart from any other racing game with its pure and simple fun-loving personality. Rip through mountain hills going 29 billion miles per hour, flying off jumps, crashing through fences and barrels, all while being chased by some badass dudes in black agent cars. The graphics are really sharp, and smooth, offering nice effects that compliment and enhance the high speeds you can acheive. Most of all, I love the open world aspect. Never are you sitting in a menu selecting your cars and your next race event. Instead, you shred around the block in whatever car you choose and squeel your tires at any stop light. Burnout is really in a class of its own when it comes to driving games. GET IT !			",105,20,1,7,6,0,4

												With out a doubt, this is hands down the most enjoyable driveing game. Turning the fictional Paradise City into your motor stomping ground, it acts as a racing, stunt, and derby game all in one beautiful area. Including a downtown area, mountain areas and highways to speed around bends and weave through cars. If you enjoy a fantastic soundtrack with an amazing physics engine this is the best choice out there. Also if you're not into car game, much like myself, you will still enjoy this fast paced, explosive, atmospheric game.			",199,25,2,12,11,4,13

												I am a very big fan of Burnout Series. I have played every single Burnout game except the first one and had a lot of fun. The last installment of Burnout series is Burnout Paradise and I love it. Freeroam mode is very good, new game modes etc. But if the game had the old modes like Drift, Maniac, Crash or Pursuit the game would be the best game of Burnout series.9/10 Worth its price.

												You're barreling down the road, pushing 150 while blasting your favorite song. You spot a fenced-off dirt road up ahead. With a swift turn off the wheel, you hear the sound of the bumper smashing through the chain links, your tires begin to kick up a cloud of dirt behind you. Small rocks fly everywhere as you listen to the soft rattling of the metal beneath your seat. Spotting a ramp at the end of the road, you push the pedal down to the floor, almost being able to feel the fuel pouring into the engine. As your tires hit the ramp, you feel nothing but pure excitement. As your tires leave the ramp, you feel nothing but pure adrenaline. Wondering if you'll hit the ground in one piece or explode into a ball of flames. Against all odds, you land the jump, your tires squeal, and you drive off into the setting sun. This is one of the few games that makes you truly feel free.			",148,8,3,21,4,0,8

												It's a pretty decent racing game. You will play it and find little things that tick you off after a while and uninstall the game. Months to years later you will reinstall it not remembering what was so bad, then within seconds of playing it all comes back to you. The decent part about it is that the driving is very fun and very fluid, 2 qualities that make or break racing games. SO, what ticks me off you ask? The narator that wont shut the ♥♥♥♥ up stating the obvious after you have been playing for hours and know everything already. The fact that you can just bearly scrape against an object and it goes into a slomo action cam as you reen off course in a metal ball of scrap signifying your loss of 1st place (this will happen every single race more than once). Don't get me wrong, going over 140mph is really fun and satisfying, but when your only 5 activity options include smashing billboards, racing, jumping off ramps, and finding shortcuts all for collection's sake you will get bored quickly. The driving and racing part of this game are flawless and make the game, the♥♥♥♥♥♥of everything else breaks the fun part.			",193,51,2,32,33,0,38

												One of my favorite examples of racing games. It keeps a good balance between realistic physics and absurd adrenaline fueled chaos. The open world was big enough to enjoy exploring and take skill to learn, but small enough that it was easy to traverse. The car roster was a bit silly, that there was a normal and a 'good' version of each car, with most of them becoming obsolete within an hour anyways, but there was always a car that would become my 'new' favorite. It's one of those racing games where you can barrel down a street at nearly the speed of sound, forgetting to blink until you plow into a civilian and send yourself flying into the sky in a million pieces. It's just cathartic fun, in my opinionI will warn that the catharsis does take a big hit near the end-game, when the difficulty of the ai opponents is just ludicrous, but I just switched to bikes, and it remained a fun experience. If you like gran turismo or other simulation racers with a bit more crunch, this isn't for you, but it's worth a few bucks to spend an hour or two as a blur along a city street. It's never a dull moment			",271,50,3,29,19,3,27

												This is a great game, with good graphics on even basic computers. However, As far as I know now, the EA online servers have been disabled, which was one of the best parts about the game. But, in my opinion, this game is still a bargain for a really well made game.			",148,25,35,9,26,3,25

												I have about 20 hours played on the PS3 version of the game. I picked up the Steam version on sale hoping another honest shot with PC-quality graphics would be enough to re-awaken a game I hoped would be amazing.It didn't.Long story short, it's no ""Burnout 3: Takedown"" and it's for two major reasons:1) The camera angle. The camera is at just a low enough position and angle to be annoying. I spent my ENTIRE time wishing I could just..grab it and...move it...up..just a little bit....but no. The game doesn't let you. I don't mind if I can't control the camera precisely but this is a FAST-paced racing game. I need to be able to see CLEARLY what's ahead of me. My car takes up too much of the screen and there's no way to get the angles you want. It's an ongoing frustration that really became a dealbreaker for me over time. The camera is too low and at too shallow of an angle. I know it sounds nit-picky but it's one of the absolute first things I noticed when I started playing the game. The camera is your worst enemy.-------------2) The fact that the entire career mode takes place within the open world.On paper this seems pretty cool...except it means they should have titled this game ""Burnout: Orienteering"". This design decision means that the game is reduced to ""memorize the city layout and use the same roads over and over again"".  Don't feel like trying to navigate a brand new city at 100 MPH? Too bad, you have to do that before you can do ANYTHING else in this game. This game demands that the player spends too much time memorizing street names, locations of gas stations, etc. rather than enjoying the fast-paced action that the Burnout games are best at. Don't get me wrong, the action is still great...but it gets lost behind this annoying navigation layer that's present for 100% of the game! Countless times I wished I could just tell the game to screw off with the city navigation stuff and just give me a track with flashing yellow signs that shouted ""THIS WAY, DUMB-BUTT!"" with occasional shortcuts hidden around, like Burnout 3.This problem is further compounded by the fact that all races end at 1 of 6 locations. This means no inner-city circuits, etc. Growing up on Burnout 3, yes you played the same stages over and over again but it worked much better because the stages were discrete levels. You didn't get the feeling that you were spending all of your time in the same square chunk of land from 0% to 100% completion. Effectively, the game turns into ""Themes and Variations on 6 tracks"".If this game had discrete tracks like Burnout 3 I think I would have enjoyed it much more. Burnout 3 still stands out as my favorite game in the series and one of my favorite racing games of all time. This game....ehh, I really wanted to like it because it did a LOT of things right - it kept the core of the ""racing/crashing game"" that burnout was best at but it obscured it with obnoxious camera angles and mandatory city memorization that just killed the experience for me. Discrete tracks let you memorize the game's levels in doses - one track at a time. Burnout Paradise forces you to learn EVERYTHING at once and it's just a frustrating ordeal when you just want to get in there and crash some cars.Too many things obscuring the core of an otherwise great game. Sorry but I just didn't like it. It did get me to play Burnout 3 again though, so it's got that going for it...?			",59,2,5,4,13,0,10

												It's a great game. I purchased it during the sale a couple days ago and I can honestly say that I don't regret that decision. I really enjoy the amount of freedom you get. You want to just race? Go ahead! You want to smash into other cars and taking them out? Go ahead! You want to fly true the air at high speed and create the most epic jumps and stunts? Go ahead! I even enjoyed simply roaming around and discovering the world. And all of that with some great music playing in the background.If all of this sounds good to you then I highly recommend this game.

												Did you not have Burnout Paradise in your childhood? Then you missed out and should buy this game to relive your childhood properly.Had Burnout Paradise growing up? You should buy it again because this Criterion deserves more money for creating this game.I have never actually written a review for a game on Steam before. I will make an exception this time. I had waaaaaay more hours in this game while growing up. Easily one of the most fun racing games ever. Just buy it, there will never be any regrets.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really simple racing game. It has the normal gamemodes that you would have in a racing game (time trials, point to point race, lap race), it also has a demolition-derby-ish gamemode that consists in destroying the opponents in order to get points (as usual, the person with the most points wins).It has a great variety of vehicles like muscle cars, super cars, some bikes and much more IF you're willing to buy the available DLCs.The multiplayer is really cool and fun too. It has all the same gamemodes that you have in single-player. Definitely worth a try, but try to buy it on a sale.			",83,4,12,2,3,2,1

												I have played this game around 50 hours and have not yet completed it.And I will play it another 50 because it's that good.You can lost yourself in the city while free roaming and lost easily hour or more. (that's good in my book)PROS:Game is really optimized so even if you have lower end pc I should play it just fine (but check don't take my word on it)Now car selection is great.Handling is wonderful.Map is nice and big (not too big but big enough)City vibe is great and I love it.Cars have basic level of customization and it's enough for me (but in depth customisation is desirable but not must).CONS:Out of box my DLC-s don't work and I have read hat there is work around but anyway it should work without that)Two bikes have bug with changing colour (there is also work around there but it should work out of box)Online is dead (but it's old game so it's nothing unusual)Missions are little reparative but it's that way with any racing game.SUMMARY:In the end I would highly recommend this game even on full price and especially on discount.Maybe there are more pros and cons but I can't remember any right now.Cons are solvable and minor and I had to mention them I'm not that picky.In short if it's on discount buy it immediately. If not think minute or two then get it.I would recommend it to anyone who like driving games.			",153,43,8,14,21,1,20

												Purchased on sale for $5 and I can say it's most definitely worth it; maybe even worth it at the regular price point as well.Insanely fun arcade racing game, different from racing sims (eg. Project Cars, Assetto Corsa). This game is more on the casual side of the racing game spectrum, but at the same time extremely exhilarating. The progression system has a variety of activities to keep you entertained, and the more you play the more vehicles you unlock from stunt and super cars to trucks and vans.The game is a few years old, so the graphics are a little dated. However, the game holds up well and still looks good. Performance is excellent running on an Intel dual core with 8GB of RAM.I've played every minute so far solo and its incredibly fun. If you have buddies to play alongside then the experience will most likey be superior.The only issue I faced with this game was at the first time startup when you are shown the product key. For some reason the game kept telling me the key was invalid, but I fixed this issue by copying the product key, opening Origin, (since this is an EA game) and activating the key onto my Origin account first. I then launched the game from Steam and made sure I used the same EA account in-game that I had activated the product key with on Origin. After that minor setback I've had no other problems. Everyone might not experience this same problem however.A must buy if you're looking for a casual racing game experience that is enjoyable solo or with friends.10/10			",110,13,3,8,4,1,2

												One of my favorite examples of racing games. It keeps a good balance between realistic physics and absurd adrenaline fueled chaos. The open world was big enough to enjoy exploring and take skill to learn, but small enough that it was easy to traverse. The car roster was a bit silly, that there was a normal and a 'good' version of each car, with most of them becoming obsolete within an hour anyways, but there was always a car that would become my 'new' favorite. It's one of those racing games where you can barrel down a street at nearly the speed of sound, forgetting to blink until you plow into a civilian and send yourself flying into the sky in a million pieces. It's just cathartic fun, in my opinionI will warn that the catharsis does take a big hit near the end-game, when the difficulty of the ai opponents is just ludicrous, but I just switched to bikes, and it remained a fun experience. If you like gran turismo or other simulation racers with a bit more crunch, this isn't for you, but it's worth a few bucks to spend an hour or two as a blur along a city street. It's never a dull moment			",271,50,3,29,19,3,27

												A fantastic fast paced arcade style action racer! Fast cars, crazy stunts, big crashes, Burnout Paradise has it all. Even now after it's aged a little it's still a fantastically fun game to play, great for a quick blast or in multiplayer. With lots of DLC available now it's really fleshed out the game. It's very playable with loads of stunt jumps to do, events to race and all kinds of stuff to keep you entertained.			",327,68,14,54,17,2,34

												DON'T BUY IT!Origin account got hacked. people tried to buy stuff on my card.my card is always empty. they failed miserably.I went to close my origin account. EA say ""if you delete your origin account it will delete all of your games on origin."" i dont care. i only had BF4.Without telling me they linked my starwars the old republic account to origin. They deleted my account and £150 worth of in game items. Also deleted my burn out account and would not let me make a new one with my product key.GG. ♥♥♥♥ burnout. ♥♥♥♥ origin. ♥♥♥♥ EANever again will i ever have anything to do with EA and I recommend anyone else reading this to take the same path. ♥♥♥♥♥est customer support EVER! not to mention their servers going down all the time.

												Firstly, I love this game because you can drive all over Europe. You have to manage your money, and make sure that, when you get out a loan from the bank, you have enough money to pay it back, or are at least making enough daily profit to pay it back.You also manage a business. You can hire drivers to work for you, and they will complete jobs for you, but you have to pay them a wage, plus some for every journey they complete. You level up they skills, that make them be better at certian things, like you can make them earn more money for going over a set distance, or you can make them carry high value or fragile cargo. They can also carry ADR materials, so things that could be dangourous. But you get paid more for that.You can always do 'Quick Jobs', and these are when the employer provides the truck, and you just go where they tell you. This is fun, but it starts to get boring, only doing short deliverys, so you can buy a truck, so that you can go further distances, and get more money.To conclude, I feel that anybody who likes games like Farm Simulator, or any simulator game should give this game a try, because it is a great way to unwind after a long day, and I have found it to be so much fun and very calming. Some people say that this is a boring game, I happen to disagree.			",179,48,13,23,25,4,25

												Here's how you do it. Go to the music settings and disable all the tedious modern music that EA insists on cramming in the game. Then enable the classical tracks that are also included for some reason. Then go drive like a madman and crash while listening to Ave Maria. Paradise is a pretty good game, but it's main draw is that it supports a rather wide range of behaviour. In some ways it's a platform game. In others it's a racing game. In some it's a exploration game.I could argue that it's some sort of post apocalyptic game where humans are dead and cars are now sentient. It's a bit eerie at times, to drive around in the barren world.Slap on some Mozart though, and it's golden!If you can snag it for cheap I recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Most active players are either diehard Burnout fans, or got this game on the Humble Bundle in 2013, but it's definitely worth the $20 Steam asks to play. It's a pretty casual car game with basic, easy physics, turbo, races, and a small slew of competitive game modes. It sounds pretty boring, but it's pretty fun, especially driving around with a few buddies. There's only one map to play on, but it's very immense. Going all the way around at top speeds with the fastest car on the furthest-out roads takes about 8 minutes for an average player. There are any kinds of roads you want to play on in there, too. Tight corners in a city, wide ocean-viewing highways, and beautifully easy-to-speed freeways. There are also a couple derby areas, train tracks and yards, residential spaces, country roads, mountain roads.. it's the full deal. Just make sure you're playing your own music (and in doing so, you'll wanna keep the volume of it at about 30% with 0dB songs, probably 50-60% at older songs).Still, definitely a great game to play time and again. If I knew anyone in particular who likes these kinds of games, we'd be playing every night.			",66,11,7,3,12,0,0

EA AT ITS FINESTThere was a time when EA was a nice company. Then, it sank on a Horrible Bosses frenzy and hardly ever gets back up. Burnout Paradise: The Ultimate Box is a perfect example of where the company went wrong.The idea of the game is interesting, quite promising -- least for someone playing Burnout for the first time. The gameplay is both good and bad, the world is fun and tedious and the game's concept of collecting cars is cool and stupid. First, while the gameplay has its bright sides, the bad of it stands out way too much, like the terrible reverse mechanic, the lack of an open world GPS system and the extremely disorganized menu. The world is beautifully designed, but too small and easy to get lost into -- since there's no open world GPS. And finally, collecting cars. There are already loads of cars in the base game, but if you really want everything the ""Ultimate Box"" has to offer, you have to... no wait, you can't even buy the DLC in game, maybe because this is the Steam version or because they're not available at the PC version at all!This is no news for those who know how EA has been for the past years, but the low price of the ""Ultimate Box"" (well, it's not the ""Ultimate Box"") is nothing but a trap to make you buy the DLCs (that is, if you're that weak). Can't buy them on the Steam version? Maybe you can on Origin, so go ahead and buy that, too! Wait, perhaps the Origin version doesn't allow DLC purchases as well? How about getting the console version(s), then? Despite the amount of [repetitive] content the titles has to offer, it truly is a shallow, seemingly rushed and poorly finished product meant to make you buy DLCs. Welcome to EA!Pros:  Interesting car wrecking idea and implementation  Large variety of cars to wreck down, collect and customize  Great amount of content spread through an open world and different game modes  Interesting level system that gives you some sense of purpose  Nice graphics  Decent performance  Plays well with a controllerCons:  Repetitive gameplay (even though this is a racing game, it is more repetitive than other titles on the genre)  Poor tutorials, making parts of the gameplay quite hard to master  Small open world, increasing the repetitive feeling since you'll run around the same streets 90% of the races  No open world GPS system  Disorganized menu, even making you run through the DLC shop to find the game options and the exit  Poor radio system where you can't even make your own playlist   The option to hide some tracks off of your radio is hidden on the disorganized menu  Tracks only go forward  Terrible reverse mechanic (really, it's clunky, confusing and doesn't work as well as it should)  The low price is a scam to make you buy DLCsBurnout Paradise can be fun, but I can't recommend it considering how clunky the gameplay can be and EA's focus on DLC. Why not give the DLCs for free, increase the game's base price and perhaps make a bigger map, fix gameplay issues and organize the menu instead of pushing this excuse of a game to the consumer? Can't say it isn't worth the full price since it's already so low and honestly, the DLCs aren't that cool -- but I'm criticizing the need for DLC instead of the DLC itself. Might be worth at 75% off since we can't even buy the DLCs.			",136,41,2,31,7,1,10

Product received for free
												It's BS that EA isn't offering any DLC besides the free Cagney and bikes update, because this game's DLC was absolutely amazing. You can still mod it in, but that's no real excuse for something that should be available as it was in the console versions, and the models for the DLC vehicles are still in the PC version, you just can't buy them.Aside from EA ]nonsense, this is easily my favorite racing game, ever, and a favorite in general, too. One of the few games that does so little wrong it really deserves a full 10/10 IMO. Even after 3 WHOLE playthroughs (mind you this isn't a short game), I had to have this for PC, and I'm still loving going through the singleplayer again.			",99,23,3,9,6,0,14

												This is my go-to game for zoning out and simply playing. I'll cruise around the city and hunt for stunts and complete races. I'll play for 15 minutes or 2 hours at a time - it doesn't matter. I love this game for the sheer fact I can pick it up and not get frustrated at it. There is always something to do that entertains me.My only gripes are the online component has been discontinued and there are no Crash events where you are given an intersection to plow into to cause the most damage possible as in previous Burnout games.

												It looks so beautiful that it hurts to know that instead for enjoying driving fast you have to watch the mini-map all the time so you know where to go. Maybe my res isn't much but after 0.1 sec I realised something is in front of me, I crashed. It's so frustating to know that half of time I need to watch crashing cutscenes instead of driving. Loading takes long (and you have to hear that annoying song every time you start the game), you can't skip cutscenes, settings are hard to find. I waited half a year before I played this game and maybe that's why it hurts so much to know that it wasn't worth of it. There's games that make me laugh. This didn't.			",35,12,4,10,12,0,7

												I bought this because it looked like a fun driving game.  The basics of the game seemed like a good idea.  You start with a car from the junkyard and a learners permit.  You cruise around looking for races/events and participate to upgrade your license and get new cars.  It seems like every intersection has an event so it wasn't too difficult to find stuff to do.  I don't like playing though.  It feels like work to me, not the kind with a pay off at the end though.  It feels like everything is pointless.  The cars feel and look generic.  The ui feels cluttered and is difficult to navigate.  I could not reccomend this game to anyone.  I could only be happy with this game if I was to get a refund.  The crashes are kinda cool though.

												If you enjoy what a child thinks a car drives like combined with the steering level of a child you would have Burnout Paradise! A garbage game that boasts a huge world, which you will learn within five minutes and then immediately grow tired of it, because even in GTA we ♥♥♥♥ing hate driving to get to missions and races. You would figure GTA San Andreas had a huge map and tons of missions, so something like Burnout wouldnt even need guns or the insides of buildings or much dialogue, right? Well, they pretty much get the size of one GTA San Andreas sized town with the same missions over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over.

If i actually manage to fix it, I would give this game a thumbs up since I've played it before, and had a blast, but since it doesn't work here, won't bother.Luckily I didn't get it full price :^), only got it for 1.30 euro's :^)			",71,10,1,6,2,1,0

												If you're looking for a classic Burnout game this is NOT it! My overall critique for those that don't want to read the whole Review is, Buy it on sale! The price, at date of review, of $19.99 CAD is too much for what this game is. There are better racing games for the price and I suggest you look at some of them first!This is an Open World racing game with Burnout-like mechanics. Road Rage is still one of the funnest game types you can play, with Marked Man following a close second, but becomes progressively harder the more you do it. This wouldn't be a bad thing if it allowed you hit as hard or defend as well as the NPC cars. It goes from NPC cars wondering into walls, basically taking themselves down, to almost god-like AI that knows exactly when you plan to boost and/or ram and reacts to you. I fine with a challenge but this is a pathetic substitution for skill/balance.Navigation in Paradise City is Hit or Miss, mostly miss as in oops I missed my turn! There's a compass/navigator that tells you when to turn but sometimes it doesn't activate until your on top of your turn. It's like driving with that one cousin that points out the side window as you pass your turn to say, ""that's the street we were supposed to turn onto!"" which blows a substantial lead as you end up in a close 2nd. About as annoying/frustrating as it gets! Also, the races are bland and feel forced. You race because you have to in order to progress and don't get me started on the ""Stunt Runs"". They are the worst part of this game. There is so much they could have done but didn't do. It's sad really!I didn't play much of the online portion of the game, as I just don't care for that sort of thing, but from what I could see there was no Party Games which I remember fondly from previous Burnout games. The lack of game modes like Eliminator or Party Crash was a big let down and what is in game for online multiplayer is lack luster at best.One annoying feature I found is the fact that your car looks half destroyed all the time. After you repair the car it looks nice for about 10 seconds and one bump later it looks like crap again. All this with no penalty outside of Marked Man or Road Rage. Your car never reaches critical and never blows up outside of those two game modes. Also, miraculously, your car seems to auto repair on the fly. How? Why?That's just one in a long list of annoying features that I won't list. There is one other that I can't ignore and is by far the most annoying thing about this game. As time goes on, and you start progressing your licence, you come across cars in the Open World that you can take down to add to your collection. They get sent to your Junk Yard and can be switched there. This is a cool idea that I like, in fact, I wish there were more cars and that they were harder to take down. Now for the annoying part. During one playthrough I was able to collect 5 unique cars before, progressing to the next level of my licence, and was required to go to the junk yard to switch cars. A crane drops your newly collected car and begins to pan around it to showcase it in all its wrecked glory. Cool I think. Then it does it again for another car, and again for another. All this is unskippable for about 10 seconds each. I want to get back to racing not watch the same cinematic play for 5 different cars.In conclusion, if you're still reading this, this game is good with some annoying features. It just doesn't feel like a burnout game in many ways. The Overall Racing is bland and the Stunt Run is just not worth mentioning, in fact I wish I could forget it even exists. Road Rage and Marked Man are the most fun and most challenging game modes. The lack of party games, which I fondly remember from previous Burnout tittles, hurts my rating of this game severely! Your car looks like trash all the time and sometimes repairs without reason which is beyond weird. Little annoying features pile up to make a real love/hate feeling.This game is fun in many ways but because of the little annoyances present in the game plus the lack of other Burnout features make it too hard for me to recommend. The current price of $19.99 CAD is just too much. I suggest waiting for it to go on Sale, until then this game should be avoided.			",217,38,3,29,22,1,36

												I bought this game a few minutes ago, and I regret my purchase. I'm having tons of issues, and I'm quite upset about this. If I cannot get the game working, I will ask Steam Support for a refund. ;(EDIT (2 Days Later): I have gotten the game working. Bugs (mostly) aside, here's my ACTUAL review below.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For years, I'd heard little blurbs about this racing game called Burnout Paradise here and there. I'd seen it used at GameStop back when I was primarily a console gamer, but I never really paid it any attention. After seeing a popular YouTuber named NerdCubed do a video on it with his dad, I was sale hunting for this game.The Steam Summer Sale came, and the game was $9.99 USD. A few of my close friends had the game, and loved it to death. I thought I'd pick it up, but it didn't just come with the game, nor just the DLC. I got an unwelcomed bonus - A NONFUNCTIONAL GAME. Multiple reinstalls, a lot of Googling, and hours of tinkering came before I got to properly experience this game. One problem after another bit me in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ the infamous DMV screen, crashing at the loading screen right when you start up the game... yada, yada. I got the game to open occasionally; sometimes, rarely, the game would launch flawlessly, and let me play just fine. The other 8 out of 10 times, it crashed. Until I fixed it, I'd only successfully launched the game three times in two days. I probably made 30+ attempts to launch the game. I tried every fix I could find on the internet, and none worked. I eventually thought to try Windows 95 Compatibility Mode ""again,"" or so I thought. I thought I'd tried it already, but I must not have! After applying that fix (some people can only get it to work on certain compatibility modes; some XP SP3, some Vista only, some Win2000 only, etc.), the game launches flawlessly. Now, the only bug I get is the game freezes when I try to quit. Saves fine, just I have to manually kill the process on exit. Steam claims I've played 8 hours of this game. I don't know how many hours of that (probably about 2) are just me trying to get it to launch properly. The game is phenomenal! The world is pretty large, with about 400 gates to smash (which lead you to backroads and alternate routes), and about 200 (I think, I'm not exactly sure) billboards to smash. Many of these billboards require you to do jumps on ramps to get to them, many of these jumps being at the end of the alternate routes that lie past those gates I told you about. I usually overlook elements like that in games, but in Paradise, I like going around and smashing them! Every intersection with a spotlight is a new race. You simply do a burnout (hold both triggers) to start one of these events; you have events where you must takedown other cars, races, events where you have to get somewhere without getting taken down, and more. There's plenty to do in Burnout Paradise!There are over 75+ cars to choose from, as well as four bikes (which I think are more fun than the cars) added by the Burnout Bikes update included in The Ultimate Box. Allow me to note that TUB was a collection of all DLCs released up to that point; Criterion had no intention to keep making more expansions when they released TUB, but they did, The Burnout Store is down, so you can't buy the other DLCs if you don't go onto either Amazon or GreenManGaming and buy a code. The racing style is very arcadey, but you can also do barrel rolls and stuff when you do jumps, which feels very good and solid. On the cars (and cars ONLY, not bikes) you can boost your vehicle. You have different types of cars like Aggression (for takedowns and strength for when you crash) and Stunt (which are faster and more for doing stunts, but crash and are wrecked very easily). The driving in this game is great, and feels amazing. The graphics in this game are pretty good, as well as the overall feel. My 650m cannot run it at maximum settings, but my buddy's dual Titans smoke it. It is a pretty good-looking game, especially when you crank it up. The visuals department is top-notch!The soundtrack is amazing, although there's only one song I really pay attention to - ""Paradise City"" by Guns 'n' Roses. That song alone makes the soundtrack AWESOME....! Overall, Burnout Paradise is a great game. Bugs aside, I give it a 8.5 out of 10. However, with the bugs in the mix, I give it a 2.5 out of 10. I would not recommend it; it may or may not work for you. I don't think it's worth the risk unless you get it off Origin, so you can return it within 24 hours with their Great Game Guarantee.

Then i have to reset the password and try to remenber the username. about the game i played it for a few minutes and wasnt impressed, there´s no menu tab for controls that i could find and it took me a while to figure them out, you speed with A brake with Z and guide with the arrow key, felt really awkward. if you press S your car will start spinning on the air and you can press shift to make it spin more, this is totally unreal and it takes too long each time, and i couldn´t find a way to skip it. and I couldn´t find a way to exit the game through the menu either, had to press alt+f4.3/10			",216,97,2,80,39,4,84

												A disappointing purchase.I was a big fan of Burnout Revenge on the Xbox 360 years ago, and was hoping to have a similar kind of experience in an open environment. I was wrong. Everything just feels so dry and lacking the charm of the previous games, even the soundtrack sucks. I don't feel the sense of speed any more, the carnage, the motor going nuts as you crash through traffic going 160+ mph. It feels like they sucked the soul out of Burnout and just stuck it in an open world, that hinders the experience more than helps. If you screw up a race big time, you can't just easily hit ""restart"" and give it another crack, no, you have to find yourself all the way back to the beginning again. Others have obviously found enjoyment in this game somehow, but if you've played Revenge and are looking for a similar experience, give Paradise a skip.			",229,35,4,10,12,0,17

												Burnout doesn't benefit from open world. Sandbox adds extra busywork such as hundreds of billboards to break and fences to push over, road records to set and locations to discover. Events no longer can be started instantly, you have to drive (often several miles) to the starting position without GPS. Spectacular Crash mode has been replaced with simplistic Showtime in which your car bounces around the road. Takedowns are far easier to execute and no longer feel rewarding as a result, rival cars can be instantly wrecked by simply grinding them against a wall.I recommend Burnout 2: Point of Impact and especially Burnout 3: Takedown & Burnout Revenge, games which I consider high points of the racing genre, over Burnout Paradise. It's up for consideration if the original Burnout from 2001 is a better game than Burnout Paradise.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""A FALLEN ANGEL"".A  lot of content is not available now. Is it a good game? Yes it is a very good game. A City that is a playground, with dozens of cars which have gone for fun over real in a very good way. Loved it on PlayStation. Love it now. But the sad thing is EA. So much good content created which the community appreciates unlike many other games and it is not available even after purchasing 'The Ultimate Box' now. A multiplayer that still is alive and EA doesn't seem to care one bit about it. Instead it focuses on Good Graphics Bad Gameplay Projects except some of its titles like Mass Effect and Battlefield. I feel that a studio like EA should have no problem to provide ""The Ultimate Box"" Content when some one has purchased ""The Ultimate Box"" as an update or something, but I guess I am wrong. I feel like after such good ratings EA doesn't care about this title. If you can go back in time then and only then buy this game. It is dying a slow but painful death now.			",41,0,1,2,0,0,0

												This game is a total piece of trash. Not only does it require you to sign up for a bs account, but it also requires that you use the most god-awful controls known to man, assuming you use a keyboard. Even if you make an account and use a controller, you're still stuck with locked framerates and poor multiplayer. 0/10, just buy Sega all stars or whatever it was. It performs better, doesn't require any extra bs, and is pretty much a better racing game all-around.			",103,9,5,10,10,1,17

												For some reason Steam only reports 30 minutes of play, despite the fact that I played for about 2 hours before I couldn't bring myself to do another event.In short: The events are simplistic and nearly impossible to fail unless you mess up badly or handicap yourself on purpose The game makes even simple things like switching vehicles a chore The world outside of the city is dull and uninspiredMore detail:My main criticism for this game is that it's not compelling in any way. I don't play racing games often, so I expected to lose at least some of the events due to a lack of skill, but it just didn't happen. In 2 hours of play, I lost 2 races, both times because I decided to ignore the on-screen instructions and tried to find a faster route. When I wasn't goofing around, the AI racers were so far behind me that they stopped showing up on the mini-map about 25% through the race, even though I was in a car that was meant to be slow, and had intentionally avoided shortcuts.The other events were also too easy to be entertaining. In stunt events, for example, you're supposed to earn points by performing stunts. It's fun in theory, but the game seemed to be rewarding me points just for driving down the road. In one instance, I drove off of a cliff after botching a jump and earned 120,000 points. I had failed the jump and wrecked my car, but the game still gave me 10x more points than the event required to pass. Why would it do this? Even when you explicitly fail, the game won't punish you at all. Obstacles are just tiny annoyances for the player.My final criticism is that the parts of the map outside of the city are just bad. The region features about 3 colors, events that are spread out andboring, and roads that present no challenge, even to a novice like myself. There are many shortcuts to mix things up, but they don't make up for the fact that the region is devoid of any memorable landmarks or interesting events. This part of the map simply isn't designed well, and I found myself avoiding it where I could.			",219,29,7,29,51,3,39

I liked the music though. But I don't think you are supposed to play this game just for the music, but for me it was for the music. I never really enjoyed playing racing games because I found them to dragging, predictable, and routine. I do not recommend buying this game in my opinion unless you are a die hard racing fan.

												3/5I've only played for 4 hours so far so take this FWIW.I think the game engine is superb for it's time, the graphics still hold up today, the physics are great, and the base gameplay is good. Despite this, I don't really like the game that much.I've played most of the previous Burnout games, and this one by far has the most repetitive, and unrewarding gameplay.The game feels incredibly easy, the AI is very wonky, and predictable, and there's almost no challenge in the game but to grind through a sequence of races, and takedown events, with some jumps/shortcuts thrown in between.The first Burnout game was extremely difficult, one mistake and you were out, this game is far too forgiving.I really don't like the open world idea for a racer, you have to rely on the minimap and some last minute directions to figure out the correct direction on a race course, it ruins the flow of gameplay for me, and I would prefer a much more linear, and non open world racer.I still gave 3 stars because clearly it's a good game at it's core, but personally I cannot bare the tedium of repeating almost identical events over and over again to unlock the next level of license.It's worth pointing out the controls are very unresponsive, especially the menus, and the layout of the game is absurd, the minimap icons are not very clear either.

Despite this, I don't really like the game that much.I've played most of the previous Burnout games, and this one by far has the most repetitive, and unrewarding gameplay.The game feels incredibly easy, the AI is very wonky, and predictable, and there's almost no challenge in the game but to grind through a sequence of races, and takedown events, with some jumps/shortcuts thrown in between.The first Burnout game was extremely difficult, one mistake and you were out, this game is far too forgiving.I really don't like the open world idea for a racer, you have to rely on the minimap and some last minute directions to figure out the correct direction on a race course, it ruins the flow of gameplay for me, and I would prefer a much more linear, and non open world racer.I still gave 3 stars because clearly it's a good game at it's core, but personally I cannot bare the tedium of repeating almost identical events over and over again to unlock the next level of license.It's worth pointing out the controls are very unresponsive, especially the menus, and the layout of the game is absurd, the minimap icons are not very clear either.

												My experience with Burnout Paradise has been a bit underwhelming. The graphics are really pretty, and the racing parts are good at getting the adrenaline pumping. It's an open world racing game where your objective is unlocking new vehicles and finding collectibles. If you like that, then this is your game.What kills it for me the most are the moments that interrupt the flow of the game -- specifically, the slow-motion scenes every time you do a stunt or come close to wrecking and the unskippable voice-overs. Keep in mind, all of this is my opinion, but the way I see it is this: In a racing game, game flow is everything. When I'm driving a race car, I want the drive to flow smoothly because driving fast and passing opponents are what I find rewarding. I get into the zone, so to speak, so every time that flow is broken, it feels like a punishment.In Burnout Paradise, there are game elements that are meant to be punishing (crashing, being taken down, failing a stunt, etc.) and there elements that are meant to be either helpful or rewarding (explanatory narration, slow motion cinematic for taking down an opponent or completing a stunt, etc.). However, since both the rewards and the punishments interrupt the game flow, all of them feel like punishments. To be specific, changing both the camera angle and the game speed is disorienting and takes me out of the zone. There have been a handful of times where I would takedown another racer only to crash into a wall myself because my concentration was broken while admiring the slow motion carnage.What's more, it's pretty clear from the awkward interface design that this is a console port. At the time of writing this review, I haven't yet tried Burnout with a controller, so it's possible that using a controller will make the game feel much better.The gameplay itself is pretty fun. That feeling of adrenaline you get when screaming down the road in a race car while taking down other racers is very thrilling. Unfortunately, I feel as though I spend just as much time, if not less time, racing as I do watching dramatic slow-mo shots, listening to some guy's voice, or fiddling around in menus.

												This is a very different game from the other Burnout games that I've played.It is very free but also very little structured and you often feel confused on which way to actually take and is this shortcut good or does it take you to somewhere you don't want to go. Special cars needed to take down aren't marked so you have no idea if you've passed it several times driving trough the town. It feels like you reeeeally need to drive around for hours before you have gotten a bit of the map down to know which roads to take in a race. The effect of this is that it feels extremely easy to pass event when you do take the right path or do what you are supposed to.It is fun to just drive around going on jumps and finding stuff but it feels like the novelty of that kind of driving would pass after awhile. After all, it is the events I want to do and when you have to drive around to find them and can't restart them without a big hassle that I feel like this cross betweem GTA and Burnout doesn't really work for me.

												Got this as part of the origin humble bundle. Firstly, on the driving game scale this is about 99% arcade and 1% sim. It's fun at first but overly easy, which rapidly makes the whole thing feel meaningless. Controls are okay (except for the menus, which are a pain to navigate) but it's obviously all designed with a game pad in mind.The whole 'one seamless world' thing is just annoying. It seems to me that they've essentially replaced a nice simple menu system for choosing your next event with a big map that you drive around randomly, trying to find something you want to do.It's not really a bad game, but it's very throw-away. I doubt I'll be spending any more time with it.			",106,31,2,12,22,2,23

												if you love unskipable and constant cutscenes, annoying and constant narating, and a game that's only goal is to play minigames to unlock more of the same minigames, buy this asap.honestly it has good driving mechanics, and looks rather nice. it's fun to drive around in the city, expecially with a controller (the keyboard controlls are pretty dumb, not listed anywhere, and not customizable) but the in-game music you can't turn off, a person who's always telling you pointless info, and VERY frequent moments where you just have to wait for the cinimatics to finish, it's a bit annoying to play.p.s. it also doesn't save your game progress online with your EA account, so I lost all my gamedata when I reinstalled windows :(			",105,15,6,8,17,2,2

												I bought this because I wanted to go back to playing Burnout, since I enjoyed Burnout: Dominator so much. But the thing this game lacks is what made Dominator so great. The burnout. The incredible speed meant that making the smallest mistake would result in disaster and having to start the burnout chain all over again. Always putting me on the edge; ready to dodge anything and everything, take out every opponent along the way, drift this way and that, and come out unscathed.Having that in free roam would've been fun, but this game makes everything way too easy. In Dominator, takedowns could just as easily result in your own demise as the enemy's, but it this game just tapping the bumper of an opponent sometimes  will send them veering into a wall. My car just bounces off of traffic like they don't way 2 or more tons. One thing I did like though was the soundtrack.I don't recommend buying this game unless you like playing on ""very easy"" 100% of the time.			",55,5,2,7,6,0,3

												This game is a good game. It has a large map, decent graphics (considering it's not exactly next-gen), and interesting cars. However, the flaws that the game exhibits makes it difficult to play. The menu and UI is akin to something one might find in a nightmare. The map is, at times, convoluted to the point of insanity. The worst, in my opinion, is the complete and utter lack of racing guidance within the game. During a race, you are given the task of getting from point A to point B, and you must get there first, ahead of all the other opponents you will race. The issue lies in the fact that there is no glowing arrow telling you which route to take, and the world is 100% open during said race. So, while racing, I can garauntee that you will spend 90% of your time watching the map, the compass, and literally every other piece of HUD that MIGHT tell you which way to go. Because one wrong turn, and the race is over for you. Now, I know what you're thinking. ""This guy's lame, he doesn't know how to race!"" Well, that may be true. Except that as you progress in the game, the speeds increase, and reaction times grow short. The AI knows EXACTLY where to go, and you are busy navigating. So would I recommend this game? No. Because you will not spend your time racing, you'll spend it navigating an unnecessarily complex and open race track.			",83,8,2,7,9,1,17

												I really tried to enjoy this game because I had heard a lot of good things about it but in the end I have an empty feeling.  It isn't really bad but it doesn't do many things right either.  The handling of the cars feels loose and similar to an old saints row game.  The city is devoid of any life or character which makes it extremely tedious to repeat the same races in the same locations.  The menu's are ugly, the radio announcer annoying and who thought it would be a good idea to show me replays whenever I perform a jump?  Oh and don't get me started on the annoyance when you take a wrong turning in a race due to the inept map system.  It's irritating because a solid effort has been ruined by poor design choices.  The more I think about those six hours playing this game, the more I wish I had just started playing Grid much sooner.  Save yourself the time and money and get Grid.			",536,179,36,59,80,11,96

												This game may have burnout in the name but it feels more like a need for speed game to me.The Burnout series has always been about battling for number one against the other cars.  This game took away from that with fact that you now choose your own path to the finish line.  It gives you a notification when you're supposed to make a turn; however, if you're like me you end up missing some of those turns taking a completely different route to the finish never seeing the other cars again.It does still have road rage and boost, but in normal races I end up taking people down at the starting line then never seeing them again.  It lacks the arcadeyness that made the series awesome.It does have a lot of events though since every intersection has another event.  It also has a lot of collectibles (crashing into billboards, through gates, jumps) which will give you something to do but in the previous versions all your collectibles were just achievements, like getting a takedown off a mountain road ('gone fishin'').So, in conclusion if need for speed (minus cops) mixed with burnout sounds good for you then you should buy it, otherwise don't waste your money.

												I got this game in the EA Humble Bundle. I was very excited for it at first, as I enjoyed the previous games in the Burnout series and this game had a great metascore. However, this game ended up letting me down on every level.The game design is bad, the difficulty as you progress becomes cheap and unfair, the menu interface is terrible, it sneakily tries to make you create an account for the game, and the open world is incredibly confusing and can screw you over if you take the wrong turn during a race.I had nothing but frustration with this game. I still beat it, since I want to beat every game on my backlog but I highly recommend that you not get this game if you haven't purchased it yet.			",100,5,2,17,9,0,14

												Open wolrd racer with burnout license.This game throws everything that definse burnout out of the window aside of the boost mechanics, instead it tries to be a Need for Speed game.If you expected a clasical burnout, dont buy it.The ability to ride bikes in this game feels attached and is incredibly unenjoyable, so if you thought that might be cool you are mistaken.While the actually driving is well done, the game is very repetitive and the whole open world mechanic doesn't really work for Burnout.The best part of the game is its main menu theme (paradise city), just buy a guns and roses album instead and be happy.'nuff said.

												This game is trash, I mean it. I played about 20 min and I cannot stand it. If you really want a driving in an open world. Get a game like GTA, SR, or Sleeping Dogs. Those have way better driving experience and you will have a lively city in those games instead of a ghost city- you see no people in this game, even in your driver's seat. Buy it only if you cannot spare a bit more to buy a uptodate urban simulator such as GTA5 or SR. It is a cheap (I did not mean price but its quality) alternative if you just want the driving part maybe you can consider this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Burnout has definitely taken a turn off the main road with this installment. Although the taking-out of cars is still a thing, it's not focused on at all in this game. I dislike this game for that matter. Otherwise, this game is meh and I wouldn't recommend this to you. You'll have more fun with any other game for this price.			",142,30,1,10,9,5,9

												I bought this game to relive the fun I had playing for hours on my PS3, but I could not have been more dissapointed. The controls were awful with terrible controller support. Everything takes ages to load on a decent system (i5-4690K, 8 GB RAM and R9 390). There are tons of screen for content that is no longer available. Tons of content from the console version is not present and never coming out (I know this game is pretty old at this point).For someone having played this on a console before, don't bother as it can't live up to past experience. For a new player, give it a try, it can't hurt but this is one purchase that I quickly refunded.			",146,13,6,14,10,0,8

												Mixing the fast paced action mechanics from the previous installments with an GTA-like open world setting was a terrible idea. You have to drive through a boring designed town to find races and when you find them you constatnly have to be aware of the mini-map for not loosing track and thus fail the the race. Furthermore it's heavy-handed to restart a race and browse through the confusing menus. I really have no idea about the good reviews, I was an average fan of the previous installment but I wouldn't recommend Paradise even as a discount.			",82,21,3,13,15,3,13

												Burnout Paradise, a good game spoilt by EA, is made by Criterion Games.The Good:Fast, this game really shows what a racing game should be about. Fast cars, and in this game even the slowest cars are fast, and they feel fastOpen World, if I have to drive around in a car, at least give me an open world map that I can explore.The Mediocre:Screen Furniture, there's too much stuff on the screen, I would like to see a little bit less.The Bad:Origin, this game is published by EA, so of course, next to the DRM that steam has, you also HAVE to have Origin DRM on the game. For the people who don't know, Origin is basically like steam, but just bad. I can't even log in, which means that I can NOT play the game at all.The VerdictYou people might enjoy the game if you can get through the DRM, but as long as EA has the DRM on the game, which makes it impossible for me to play this game, I will not recommend this game.

												A completely sanitized EA Games racing car sandbox. It's basically car porn for kids. I'm not too much into simulation games: racing, fighting, sports, etc. but even so this is a two-dimensional experience. You collect cars, drive them, speed, drift, crash every ten seconds, smash other cars, and that's about it.It's nice if you want to masturbate your OCD completion addiction, but otherwise racing fans should be able to find better simulations, and non-racing fans should just go with BLUR. Which is what I'm going to do after I complete this crap, sometime.7 / 12I'm being generous because I did have some fun and spent a lot of time on it.			",721,226,15,79,62,10,111

												I was fun on the PS2. Not here. And it will never be.The game itself wasn't really planned to be on the PC, but I digress. It's amusing, time wasting if you're on a laptop waiting for the plane to land or..something? Not worth my time, though.Ehem! The only reason I have this game is because my friend had a few extra bucks from a deal and got me this from Humble Bundle. Not the best from the site, but sort of beggars can't be choosers, now can they.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have no idea how this game got such high reviews. Got it for a buck in a Humble Bundle, downloaded the save game to unlock all of the cars, and proceeded to play. Terribly monotonous. Even during its peak (if it had one) I'm sure my opinion would have remained the same.- A Burnout game without a classic crash mode? Immediate disappointment.- I saw all of the damage a vehicle could take within the first 30 minutes of driving around.- Crashing (or performing certain jumps in single player) always resulted in this annoying, slow motion effect. Always.- Annoying pop-ups in the middle of the screen blocked my view.- DJ Atomica. Enough said.- Playing ""Paradise City"" so much I almost started to hate it.- Camera angle wasn't adjustable to fixed positions; I had to hold up on the right joystick just to get the view I wanted.- Cars felt like they were made of paper sometimes.- What's worse was how often my little ricer car could take down a truck three times its size and mass.- No speedometer.- Sometimes, if I got hit by another car (e.g. during Road Rage), I would brake to stop from crashing, but the game overrode the brakes and I swerved and crashed, anyway.- Lack of VoIP options and no text communication.There were some positives, but they were always balanced out with a negative. I enjoyed the size of the map, but disliked the overall layout. The online minigames were fun to play with friends or even strangers, but all it took was one or two people to not complete the objective to kill the fun.3/10			",112,7,2,8,5,0,1

												Where to start... well the online features (and therefore certain dlc and such) have been gone for years so that's something, the game butchers a lot of good songs and for some reason chose gnrs most annoying track to play every time you launch the game, you can't fully turn off the opera music that they put into the game... sure it has humour value to put that into a game like this but allow us to fully remove the crap if we don't like it... you can turn it off when you're actively playing but leave the room for 5 minutes to grab a drink and it's gone into a cinematic mode with bach or some other operatic junk playing which is almost as unforgivable as the teribly cut apart versions of good songs they've used in the soundtrack.The icing on the cake is that as a racing game it has issues with some official 360 pads when it was a 360 title... if you've somehow made sure that the pad you have works with it properly then sweet buy it if you want but be warned about the music and maybe play it muted with winamp in the background instead of the damaged music and operactic noise they put in.

												I have many peculiar interests that people often laugh at, but despite the fact I'm not losing heart and continue to like the things I like. I must apologize for the use of a bad word, but I feel this is the most proper way to get the message across: I ♥♥♥♥ING LOVE BOXES.So when I saw the title of the game - Burnout Paradise: The Ultimate Box - I was very excited. Finally not only someone has noticed a niche of box lovers like me, but also made it a ULTIMATE BOX. This suggested that in this game I'll be able to deal with the best, the most unimaginable, wonderful and perfect box the world was has even seen. I bought the game in a heartbeat.Upon launching, it turned out it's not that easy and I have to drive a car to get the box. Well, nothing is easy in life and I couldn't be simply given the most ultimate of all boxes. Not only that, it seems that there are enemies that compete with me for the box. I decided to take up the challenge.I've spend days trying to find the box. I've got through all the levels and challenges and in the end all I managed to find was bitter disappointment: despite the title the game does not contain any boxes. I only got a driving license at the end, which doesn't even make sense, since I driven the car through all the game. How can you drive a car without a license?At this point I don't even know if the main hero is a guy, girl or a sentient car. I'm thinking you're a guy, because girls couldn't drive that well (the game has too much speed) and what use for a box does the car have, even if it would be sentient? Car wouldn't be able to use box, even if it was ultimate. Developers couldn't even use basic logic.Overall I give this game 0.2 out of 88. I think that developers should finally learn their lesson and stop misleading honest games like me with inaccurate and plain lying titles. Do not buy this game: you'll get as heartbroken and burnout as I am.			",122,30,1,20,9,3,6

												As much as I want to like this game...I can't. I love the Burnout series. But there are so many problems with this one. First off is the multiplayer...that's completely down so you can't get anything. Second is the graphics, while some people think they look good I find them not to be...the pictures you see make the game look prettier than it really is. Third is the mechanics. Drifting is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥because once you go into a drift it's hard to get out. The flow doesn't feel as smooth as it does in the other Burnout games and turning corners is more irritating than fun. Not only that but the physics don't feel realistic enough either. The ""DJ"" of this game gets VERY annoying very quickly and there's no way to turn off his repetitive comments of how you can win. The races are literally just point A to point B. At most you make maybe one or two turns in a race and you can get to the finish line. Sure you can take shortcuts along the way...but the shortcuts also feel too repetitive and conveniently placed. I also feel like the cars in this game are a joke. And while I appreciate almost all types of music....all there is is rock and alternative. There's really no real different genres. Personally I find this game sad. 5/10 -Frillin			",161,10,5,12,4,0,5

												Hello, Fred Fuchs here. As you all know I am a very esteemed game reviewer and critic, and I would like to give my review about this game. As I was walking throughout my 2,5 million dollar mansion, I happened upon something quite curious. I saw a box, the title of the box being ""Burnout Paradise"". I immediately looked at the box, and what I noticed made me kill myself on the inside. I went out to the patio and had a long deep thought about the meaning of life, when suddenly I saw a Lamborghini Veneno, the man inside of the car was throwing♥♥♥♥♥♥at my mansion. I gripped the box firmly in one hand, and I threw the ♥♥♥♥ing thing away as far as I could from my beautiful mansion, before it could corrupt the purity and beauty of my expensive as ♥♥♥♥ mansion.

												This game is, I think one of the worst burnout games of all time, Gone is the linear tracks and crash mode, This game had so much potential and EA squandered it on dlc packs that you can no longer buy and a shity new gamemode called showmode, Were your car jumps in the air and you must steer it into traffic to get points, sounds like crash mode well your wrong its a shity replacement that is stupid and a waste of time as you get nothing in return, If you want to play a burnout game pls get yourself a old ps2 and get burnout 2 point of inpact and or burnout 3 takedown as there games more worth your time. Ps This is my opinion so if you like this game then good for you.			",159,8,4,4,18,2,12

												Upon recieving this game from a friend i have come to the conclusion that this game is complete and utter S***. Granted it is a 2009 game and not that good, seriously? Is this an actual game? As soon as you get into the ♥♥♥♥ing game you just hear guns and roses, then again once in the game at 100% volume which then since i couldnt find the audio options i have to alt tab just to ♥♥♥♥ing turn down the paradise song in my head. Then the multiplayer, where do i begin. You see party.. nope only single player. its almost like false advertising. I guess if you want to spend the 5 bucks for it go ahead. or than that pls no buy :( 0/10 - IGN			",56,1,0,5,0,1,1

												Mildly entertaining racing game that gets old really fast.For a 2009 game the graphics still hold up fairly well, and it performs smoothly at 1920x1080 resolution. It's fun to race and take down opponent cars by slamming them into obstacles, but the experience grows stale too quickly.The environment is limited to one city so you'll see the same roads and scenery over and over again. The cars all handle pretty similarly so there's not much variety there, either.Where things get really frustrating is the user friendliness. The game doesn't do a very good job of showing where to go, so you can easily get lost while trying to race ahead of your opponents. Who wants to constantly be looking at the map while driving? It's easy to lose races because of this, and when it happens there's no way to quickly retry. You have to drive all the way back to the beginning, which can sometimes take a good 5 minutes. Given how repetitive this experience is, the game feels torturous and you feel like you are getting punished for not memorizing the city's layout.There are cars that you can't unlock because the online servers are dead forever, so they're just there to tease you.There's really not much here to recommend, to be honest.

												Oh boy, let me just start this ""review"" (If we can call it that) by warning you to stay away from the PC version of Burnout Paradise!No, not because of its gameplay and/or visual quality (I owned this bad boy a few years ago on the X360 and it was indeed a fun ride), but because this game is the absolute definition of garbage on the PC!...and why is that you might ask?Well, where do I start?First off, I cannot for the life of me start this game up by conventional means without it crashing instantly, and trust me, I'm not the only one experiencing similar problems, browse it on the internet if you must. ...but of course, such could be fixed easily, just give the game a try in ""compatibility mode"", and you should be good to go right? Wrong!Running this bastar♥ in compatibility mode for ""Windows XP Service Pack 3"" (the recommended) or even going as far as adventuring your self in the ancient ruins of ""Windows 95"" will in fact boot you up past the start up screen, but good luck playing the game for about 10 or so minutes without it freezing dead on its tracks!On top of it by running it in compatibility mode you can kiss your steam overlay tab good bye.I didn't gave up though, upon some research, I discovered that many other things could cause the game to crash such as programs related to your Webcam, which you obviously shouldn't bother with if you don't have one, that is unless you happen to have ""Dxtory"" (which is kindda like good old ""Fraps"") installed, as for some odd reason ""Dxtory"" appears as a Webcam, and yes even if it's turned off it'll affect the game (I heard ""XSplit"" might cause the same symptoms as ""Dxtory"", but I'm not sure), uninstall it and see if it does the trick....but it could maybe even be related to your multi-core CPU, which if so, it could supposedly be fixed by doing as it follows...- Right Click ""Burnout Paradise"" > Properties > Set Launch Options > (type in) -multithread (and press OK).Of course, such didn't work for me either and sadly, as of now, I can only play the game 10 minutes at a time, on top of that, the game does not support classic ""Window Mode"", which might not seem like a big deal, but sometimes you might need to do such because reasons...As a final verdict, do NOT waste your greens on the PC version of this game (unless you're still rocking little old Windows XP, wich I think might play Burnout Paradise withouth any problems, but I'm not sure of it), it's simply not worth it, have a good one.

												This game comes without the one thing driving games used to be about - two player splitscreen. Thus for me it's useless. If you're looking for a good racing game to play locally with our buddy you're in the wrong place. I didn't think that a Burnout without the most integral part of a racing game would be possible, so I bought it without looking it up. Yep, guess I wasted my money.

												Nice graphics, and it's open world - you choose your route to the finish line.Unfortunately, the racing itself is terrible. It has the common issue of having reverse/accelerate be the brakes for each other, so you have no dedicated brake key (nor anything that actually functions as brakes would). There are no gear changes (not even automatic gear changes - whaaat), and the steering is beyond oversensitive. It's also a shame that there's no in-seat view when driving - your view is either behind the car, or right in front of it.You'll also have your driving constantly interrupted (literally pausing the race and your progress halfway through) until you get through all of the gaudy tutorial messages, of which there are heaaaaaps.

												This game looks like it came out of 2004. It has the most unnatural keybinds that I've ever seen. You cannot change these keybinds. (A is accelerate. Z is reverse. left-ctrl is handbrake). Arrow keys are how you turn. If you want a driving game, this is NOT it. This is a game for early 2000 model laptops. I refunded this within 7 minutes of purchasing and I will not regret it.			",63,9,2,4,33,0,16

												It's an open world racer (of sorts) that overcomplicates the racing elements while over simplifying all the customization options.PROS-A fairly large & open world to explore-Collectibles-Lots of different cars-Online ModesCONS-The world is confusing & easy to get lost -Steam Version is incomplete & has DLC cars that can't be obtained-Online Modes have Cheaters-Requiares EA Account Log-InGAMEPLAY & FEATURESI guess you could call this game an open world collectathon with races & challenges as your objectives.  It's a very good concept but some parts weren't really executed properly.  For one, it's hard to figure out where exactly you are in the world & where you need to go in races.  Most racing games have you on a set track but this game all the tracks are connected & if you mess up by making a wrong turn you're pretty much screwed. To actually race you need to memorize the world map for the best routes to take in each race & it's just not worth it for the minimal rewards you get for doing it.  Each race is set up so you drive to the starting point, press a button & start the race.  The problem with this is you have absolutely no idea where you're going or the routes you need to take to get there.  It will take you several tries just to find & win the simplest of tracks because of the huge lack of direction you're given.  The game does try to help you by using the blinker on your car to tell you when there's an upcoming turn at least but it's not nearly enough.  I constantly find myself trying to do races & getting lost during them simply because of how lack of direction there is in this game.The plus side is the Road Rage races, where direction is not really needed.  You just need to take out as many other racers as you can within the time limit while reaching the set goal.  This is probably the best challenge in the game since you don't need to figure out where to go & just drive. There are also things in the world to collect & find such as hidden pathways, cars to take down that add themselves to your collection & bill boards.  I don't know if you actually get anything for doing 100% since I don't care enough about this game to 100% collect everything in it.  Most of what it seemed relatively pointless, honestly, with the exception of the car unlocks.You can customize certain cars but only the type of color & paint job, e.g. Metalic, gloss, etc.  The motorcycles let you pick between Male/Female riders but that's about it. That's really all you can do cuztomization wise.ISSUESThere's also an abundance of cheaters in online modes.  Just recently I had a game with at least two cheaters who were both using cheats that gave them instant take downs & made them immune to take downs.  Basically, this means that whenever they just barely tapped my car or anyone elses we'd be taken down & even if we rammed them through a wall they'd never be taken down.  Their takedown score was around 10x what everyone elses was the entire match.  And trust me, I played with these two long enough to know they were cheating.  I only wish I was recording at the time so I could show all the BS that was going on.There's also a small amount of people who actually play online now.  I played this game for several hours recently & got into about 4 games but each game I was in one of those two cheaters were always in one.  So, in the end I just accepted that I wasn't gonna be playing to win & just ended up goofing off with the hackers for a few hours.  There also is no report system in the game so if someone is cheating you can't do anything about it.  The only thing you can do is try to deal with it or leave the online mode.You also can't get the DLC content through Steam since EA is a bunch of D-bags.  They cut off the EA marketplace so even though you're buying the ""Ultimate Box"" you're getting an incomplete product.  To make matters worse the online shop will constantly pop up every time you boot up the game, but it will just load a blank white screen.  So, it taunts you saying, ""Yea, this game is missing features.  Thanks for buying it, sucker!""  OVERALLOverall, this game isn't bad but it's really not worth anyone's time anymore unless you just want a driving game to goof off with. The online modes have hackers & the whole game takes too long to figure out & memorize.  If you want a real racing experience that doesn't just involve driving around in an open world where you just crash cars you'd be better off trying something else.  If not, then feel free to try this one cause crashing cars & driving around doing random nonsense is the best part about this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alright so I'm not normally the guy to write Reviews but here we go :I saw this Title for 1,50€ on sale and since I played it countless of hours on my playstation3 I thought might aswell grab it while its practically free (compared to the 1 1/2 burgers you'd get for that money)While downloading this game I watched the reviews for this game. Normally I do that before I buy games but well I knew what I buy here.So my shock was even greater when I checked all the negative reviews while downloading this game, speaking of constant crashes, the most abysmal port they have ever seen etc.Let me tell you this, maybe im one out of a thousand (I don't think so) but so far this game works flawlessly for me. Even better than on console.Many bad reviews were given because apparently the game is crashing on their side because of some webcam issue because the game wants to take a picture of you for your drivers license.. Did these people never open the configuration before starting the game? You can disable the webcam there. BOOM. Done.Also I saw bad reviews because apparently the game didn't pick up the xbox controller. I started the game, took my xbox controller in my hand and rocked through Paradise City.There were also many bad reviews because its an open world racing game and they were saying as how you would get lost and only look at the map while driving.. Yeah, maybe, if you just start the game.. but after years of not playing this game I bought it today on PC, jumped into the game and could still drive like a master through this awesome designed city, I still knew all the shortcuts i basically felt right at home. Just because the game doesn't only give you one simple straight path with no other choices to drive on doesn't make it a bad racing game - it juThere is one bad point about this game. It seems as if the developers dropped the ingame DLC's you can buy. So you can no longer ingame spend your money on other cars (and lets be honest here, you can get about 6 normal cars and idk 15 toy cars which never appealed to me) but i've heard there is a fix for that which just unlocks all the cars without having you to spend anything. ALSO THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT ONLINE WON'T WORK ANYMORE. As far as I could see all online functions were still working just fine.Yes, its a bit different from Burnout 3 (which is still the best in the series imo) but there is really a LOT of fun to be had here. In some aspects I like it even more than BO3 because of the open world you get to know places and even though no race is like the other after and after you learn the city and later missions aren't just harder because the A.I drives more unfairly but also because it becomes hard to combo all the shortcuts you've learned on the whole map into one good run on a race.I think for 1,50€ it is INSANE value, even for the full price at 6€ I still think its basically stealing from the developers. I played at least 200hours on playstation and I didnt even get into online thaaat far. By the way, Online functions are really great in this game.To be honest I would still be recommending it for 20€. Great game 9/10			",151,9,2,23,8,0,9

												Very disappointing. The game looks good enough, especially with ENB, but that's about all it has going for it. Criterion purport the idea of race events on a free roam map as something new, ""unlike any other driving experience"", even though Need for Speed Underground 2 and Test Drive Unlimited had both done similar things prior to its release. All events are extremely easy, and with no difficulty option (at least not one I could find in the ill-conceived labyrinthine menu system), the game soon becomes very dull. In-game advertisements are a spit in the face from the developers. Perhaps it would be understandable if the game were free to play, or if it were trying to emulate a ""real world"", but it's not. These were clearly only put in for profit, not an attempt at realism, since the game is set in a fictional city and none of the cars are licensed. I paid for the game I don't want to see Burger King and EVGA advertisements while playing it. Various elements of the game are at cross-purposes with each other. Events are put at every intersection, supposedly to cut down on monotony and so there's never an event too far away, but the races aren't gated and the route isn't highlighted on the map as with other arcade racers, which means you have to open your map at the beginning of each race and spend time planning your route. You can't jump to events either, which, in the case of Burning Route events, often means you have to drive halfway across the map just to begin a race. On the topic of Burning Route events; the game boasts a range of 75 cars, when in actuality, in terms of unique vehicles there is about half that, with the other half being practically carbon-copies with different paint jobs which are rewarded after completing time trials. By the end of the game, you'll only be using about 3 of the cars anyway (the best in each category; stunt, aggression and speed), since the others are relatively useless. The soundtrack is awful. For reasons unknown to anyone but the developers, there are 3 different styles of music in this game; pop/rock songs, instrumental songs from the three previous Burnout games, and classical compositions. The loudness levels are not normalized either, which means that some songs are barely audible while others are quite loud. The ""CrashFM"" DJ is obnoxious and detestable.			",109,9,3,4,1,1,1

												Honestly, like what does this game even offer?A bunch of weird made-up carsBig-ish city with challenges half-hazardly littered everywhere with no rhyme or reasonThere's not even a driver inside your car, it's literally emptyHalf of the game's content is locked behind DLC (which isn't even being sold anymore because EFF YOU)This game kinda summarizes everything I hate about racing games - it's just self fulfilling and pointless.  There's nothing driving you (lol) to do the challenges, and that's all this game has to offer: a ton of challenges to complete.  It's just a giant unrewarding chore.  I don't think that's a meaningful experience.If you do want to pick it up, look up the Vanity Pack mod online.  Otherwise, pass.			",126,33,2,15,11,0,25

												What a complete failure. I can't even begin to understand how Criterion Games could make such a piece of garbage after the masterpiece that is Burnout 3: Takedown. This game is a complete joke. I literally deliberately TRIED to crash my car, and to succeed at that, I needed to crash into a heavy♥♥♥♥♥truck. A normal car wasn't enough. The open world aspect only hurts this game. It is not fun to commute from A to B just to get to an event. The occasional stunt jump along the way does not make it sufficiently fun or interesting. It would be much better to simply select a race/event from a menu.If you want to play a good Burnout, play Burnout 2, 3, or Revenge, and avoid this trash.			",252,80,7,23,30,3,17

Product received for free
												If flatout 2 and FUEL have a child, this would be the hideus resultThis is suppose to be a racing game right? well that is what at least try to market, a game with cars that just happen to go fast isn't a racing game. The focus on this game is to get from A to B wrecking every oppponent on your way, like seriously, it doesn't get any better than that. Oh also something important.. traffic > you, you'll be crashing every 5 minutes against either a wall or a traffic car crusing the intersection which it will be EXACTLY where you'll be if you dont change your speed or direction taking you 5 valuble seconds which makes you loose the race. Every time you crash you need to see a 5 seconds animation which you CANT skip. The car is totally unresponsive to start needing 2/3 seconds to be able to start using the boost, same applies if you have being going on reverse and then you need to go forward again. The menu is the worst thing you can imagine, its absolutly and disgustingly crafted, if you want to the options menu you need to go like 3 other menus, everytime you hit the pause button because the ""main menu"" is just stats of what you found.Also the game doesn't teach you how to stop an unwanted race so I need it to go and join the online servers in order to do so AND JUST WHEN I DO IT THE GAME FINALLY TEACHS ME HOW ""If you want to stop a race just stop in the place till its over"" oh that would have been great to know like 10 mins before when I was trying to figure something out..There a 3 disciplines of cars: stunt - speed - strenght, everyone represent how they get boost and how it works, stunts you may already figured, strenght by hitting other cars and speed by driving alone, but here's where the desing goes even worst. A game like racing demands fast reactions and tools that you need to know how they work and that you can trust (cars you know how they steer, how they drift and they acceleration) the game totally fails at giving you any of that, there are several cars that feel just horrible and next to impossible to use it in a real scenario (i played ""arcady"" racing game many years of my life and play with a gamepad so it's not me the problem). The best of all is that the speed cars are only able to use boost when its full, and if you get enough while using it you may still use it but the amount of traffic this game has is ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS so is absolutly unreliable and also its unpractical because you cant get from it what you need when you need itClosing notes: if you want a GOOD open world racing game just go and play any need for speed, from the top of my head ""most wanted"", ""underground 2"", ""carbon"", and just to mention a few. If you want something hard that you will die every five minutes but its actually fun and challenging go for any dark souls.if you specificaly want a racing game where destruction is the focus go with flatout 2 (it even has a derby mode and many other fun games)TL;DR:this ain't a racing game just a derby with the objective of going from A to B with a lot of horribly mechanics for the cars and unhumanly possible amount of traffic that will F*** you up. Also the game isn't challenging at all, the traffic and bad camera is punishing creating this pseudo-hard gameplay			",101,18,2,14,9,2,11

												If you've ever played Burnout 3, then you will know that this game sucks horribly compared to it. Sure, for a generic everyday ""me is srs gamR"" type of person it might be fun, but having played Burnout 3 for so many years and then try to play this monstorosity is like trying to eat rock after eating cake. I'm guessing that they went like ""Oh, you know all these things that made Burnout 3 one of the greatest and most fun racing games ever? Come on Steven, you know what I'm talking about; the aftertouch, the takedowns, the crashes. Yeah all those, let's just remove them and make something that makes our fans cry their tears out"".At this point I am literally speechless(hence why I'm typing) at how bad this turned out. I tested it when I bought it from the Humble Bundle, and I tested it today again, but it just didn't work out. At best I give this game 3/10, because it has okay music and the enviroment is pretty nice looking.			",72,8,3,8,3,0,4

												I personally didn't like this. I had high hopes when I got this from the Humble Bundle but it really wasn't what I was hoping for.The controls are clunky, you would think WASD would be simple enough where W is accel and S is brake/reverse but it's some weird controls like X to accel or something like that. Why?I'm really good at racing games (most of the time). But I can't even beat the first race in this.If you're a fan of Burnout, go for it - but me personally, I don't like it.			",104,7,3,8,8,1,4

												This game is way too simplistic, repetitive and too long for its own good. You don’t feel real progression throughout the game. The driving feels like a dumbed down version of burnout 3, there isn’t really any challenge in the races themselves and the cars all feel and handle the same. What ultimately kills this game for me is the lack of variety in the activities you are doing. You are doing the same sh*t throughout the same areas of the open world map hundreds of times. Here are some ways to prevent a racing game from feeling repetitive. 1.	Feeling real progression as you are playing e.g. NFS Most Wanted 20052.	Introducing new tracks and different visuals and locations3.	Car customization and upgrades 4.	Depth in the driving mechanicsAll those points I mentioned this game lacks. This open world is just so boring to drive around, it just feels so lifeless, uneventful and bland visually. This open world is no need for speed underground 2 that’s for sure. I know it sounds like I am a NFS fan boy but it is honestly the best comparison I can make because this is the only burnout game that tried to pull off an open world like underground 2 did from underground 1. They should have honestly just stuck with what worked like burnout 3. There are also just so many small issues with the game that all build up together making the experience less enjoyable like the overall navigation and the overall time it takes to travel between each event. I was so bored after just 3 hours I couldn’t play it anymore. I have played so many better racing games throughout my life, this game is worse than even the average racing game. 4/10 (Mediocre) ",234,11,3,24,1,1,2

												I probably haven't played enough of this game to really give the best judgement, but I've played it enough to know that I don't really like it, and have NO clue how the game managed to get an 87 metascore.Cons- the choice of soundtrack for this game might cause suicidal thoughts and tendencies, or incite violence towards others (translation: WORST soundtrack to a game, ever)- not every game needs to be open-world...you would think a racing game could work in an open-world environment, but this one does not, unless you just like driving aimlessly in a virtual world through what is more or less an empty city.- the previous burnout games seemed to be substantially more fun; this makes this particular iteration of the series seem like a hollow cash-grab- HORRIBLE and ANNOYING user-interface- due to the repetitive nature, this game gets very old, fastPros- you get to drive fast and wreck into things- I could see multiplayer possibly being a little fun, but I haven't played it that This game is terrible...just plain terrible...

I never get tired of racing around the city and looking at all the landmarks, while listening to the thunder of my engine and the amazing soundtrack. I'll definitely play more of this game and I don't see myself getting tired of it any time soon.My only complaint is that the multiplayer is dead, but that's a non-issue with this game because the multiplayer wasn't as fun anyway.

												The game itself is amazing and awesome, and there are still some lobbies out there for multiplayer on PC which is nice, however, I do wish all the DLC was ported, or at least big surf island. There are 3 classes of cars which each have their own important role in the game. There are a good amount of cars to collect along with a lot of paint options for each car. This game is also probably the most action packed racer I've played too due to how cars always smash each other up in the brunt of traffic and just trying to do a standard race normally can get a little intense (dare I say?). The awesome part about the open world is that there are literally hundreds of hidden ways you can go throughout the map along with tons of hidden things to find. So, on PC, I rate this a 8/10. If they ported all the DLC and included it, it would be a 9/10.			",161,9,3,34,23,0,13

												Mastering the art of crashing in spectacular fashion, Burnout is back, with Paradise. In Paradise city (where the girls are pretty) players will encounter many things including the classics such as races and road rages through to the newer features like open-world stunt, speed and strength attributes for each car oh and did I mention it has a massive Guns 'n' Roses presence? It's got a MASSIVE Guns 'n' Roses presence (like the game title massive). Ontop of all this we have multiplayer which is essentially a sandbox for you and your friends to race, rage, stunt and crash in awesome fashion, also includes the chance to witness half naked dudes smiling in front of fans in their webcam reaction image (see ""This Guy"" Image). Though the crashes are epic, somehow Burnout 3's are still ..just better. Despite this Paradise is indeed where the cars (girls) are pretty...until you crash them of course. 8/10.

												I'll start by saying that I don't really play racing games. The last racing game I've played was Burnout Revenge on PS2 and that was years ago. Before that, it was the GT3 on PS2. When the Origin bundle came out, I had heard about this but I wasn't really interested in it because I had heard it was very different from the older Burnout games. Well, it is, but I still managed to have fun with it. It's not without its flaws, though: the loading times are slow, unlocking every car takes so long and some of the game modes are absolutely boring. However, it's one of the racing games that actually made me want to play it for 30 hours. For me, that's good enough already.			",346,47,25,55,22,2,48

												8.5/10 Fantastic racing game, very open and gives you the option to do what you want while keeping you immersed in the game. You drive your car around picking races depending on their location on the map earning your self new licenses depending on how many races you win. Handling is fantastic as well as the boost and “takedowns”. Environment is very fluid, races are very well placed and you will start to get to know all the shortcuts in no time. The best part of this game is the Biker expansion, the controls for the Bikes are fantastic and although there aren't a huge amount of races to be played its a awesome add on to a awesome game.

												READ THIS FIRST:  The online is no longer supported by EA.  You can still do direct connections to friends and LAN it up.  Don't pass over this game because of this problem though. Burnout Paradise is deffinately one of the best driving games ever made.  It has controller and wheel support as well.  The trailer says it all. It just lies about the DLC. The dlc store is no longer active.  This is still a great game that holds up to todays standards (2012 when I write this review). For the low price of 20$ (5$ on sale) this game is completely worth your hard earned money if you are a racing or burnout fan.   EA and valve have been fighting it out over origin and steam. So I'd reccomend buying this before it gets removed entirely from steam. (Could happen). ~PR0XIDIAN			",912,138,59,85,56,7,110

												Many games have stories and levels that are just linear. Burnout Paradise is the exact opposite of that. After a quick tutorial, you are thrown into a city with a car and a bunch of challenges. You don't even need to do the challenges to have fun as you can just drive around the city and pretty much do whatever you want. The crashes look phenomenal and repairs have no penalty and are instant. This is a driving experience that you don't want to miss. 96/100			",645,102,42,87,88,11,104

												Burnout Paradise is the story of a city terrorized by a car driving poultergeist. The city desperately tries to function as it forces other drivers and one insane radio host to engage the maddened spirit in a series of races and stunt competitions in an attempt to distract it from wholesale destruction and crash cams. The government has abandoned the city in hopes of containing the menace, shutting down air travel and train travel, which just provides the poultergeist with more space to crash cars. The spirit is only embodied in human form when on a motorcycle, but that form disappears the second the motorcycle crashes.You are that poultergeist. Terrify a city as you possess different shiny cars. Reward their attempts to appease you by engaging in their races or laugh in their faces and crash in the most creative ways possible, forcing them to give you free gas, car repairs, and paint jobs. Or just drive really fast, scaring the poor people of this embattled city to death with the reckless abandon of your wild, wild poultergeist joy.*DISCLAIMER* This game is not actually about a poultergeist. It's just a fun driving game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While the grass is sparce and the girls non-existent, Paradise offers a fast, fun, and satisfying experience to both newcomers and veterans to the Burnout series. The mechanics are easy to pick up, the city is filled with ramps, billboards, and gates to smash through, and the races are plentiful. The game looks beautiful, runs well, and has a great selection of radio tracks. The plethora of cars and bikes keep you coming back for more, and the online multiplayer provides an endless amount of entertainment. Sadly, Crash mode from the previous Burnout games has been removed. If you liked the linear, unique tracks of the previous games, the open-world aspect of Paradise will be a bit of a change. Cars are now divided into 3 classes: Stunt, Aggression, and Speed, each class has its own way of filling the boost meter. I've logged more hours in this game than I can count on the console version, and I plan to log many more on the PC. If you are a racing game fan, a Burnout fan, or even just a gamer, Burnout Paradise is worth your money.			",204,18,10,22,7,0,2

												Despite being nearly five years old Burnout Paradise is still my favourite arcade racer. The game world is constucted in such a way that I can drive for hours without any particular goal in mind and still enjoy myself. I just wish they kept in a mode similar to the older burnouts wherein you ride down a hill, smash into oncoming traffic and try to score as many points as you can.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Finally got my hands on the PC version of this game. And I still admit that it is one of the best racing games available.Yet still I was quite dissapointed about the lack of content from console version, but all this was forgotten when I finally tried the awesome online mode, and wasted some people's cars.Oh and my Ingame name is: RandarenAdd me and I will accept.

												I recommend this game to anyone looking for a good racing game to play on the PC. It's even better to compete against friends in real-time races. There's a lot of events, so it's good for any racer who like to do stunts, or crash other cars, or just race in traffic. I've played a lot of racing games and I think this one is one of my personal favorites.			",64,4,1,11,10,1,11

												A reasonable 'unofficial end' to the burnout series, but far from the best. Having grown up on the console versions from the original through to revenge, I was actually disappointed by a few things, most notably the 'removal' of crashes as a core-component (as in, they're in there, but they're not essential to progress). Sometimes I found the new open world feature a little annoying. I want to go straight to an event - but no, instead I have to muck around driving to it, only to realise I don't have the right sort of car, so I have to spend ages driving back to somewhere I can swap a car just to go back and compete. Although, it was something new and it made things kind of fun. It even made you want to 'line up' your challenges, so that the end of one race was close to the start of another....I found it a bit unfulfilling, a lot of the unlocks came too easy and made little sense... I feel as though it's a bit of a victim of instant gratification-esque achievements in an attempt to try and woo gamers with short attention span that only enjoy frequent accomplishments rather than gamers that prefer a real challenge. Also I can now never listen to that stupid Guns 'n' Roses song ever again.... avoid if you like, and/or want to continue liking Guns 'n' Roses.			",102,24,2,6,7,0,5

												If you're looking for something that offers a quick blast that is an alternative to other racing out there, there's this.Yes there is a silly and loose story attached, the absolute sin of unskippable cutscenes and the music selection tries to cater to everyone (look for the Jobcentre ""on hold"" music, I'll let you find it and not spoil it :P ) and - like any ""best of"" compilation, only one or two songs will stand out.Ultimately, it is arcade racing fun that doesn't require anything more than a keyboard and multiplayer races won't ever be filled with the snobs that will play Race '07 and the like.

												This game is a bit old now, but it's still one of the finest open-world racing games I've played.Pros:* Great soundtrack* Great visuals for its age.* Lots of that traditional ""burnout"" recklessness and fun.* Open World, with races and events being started at certain locations.* Large variety of events, from races to stunt runs.* I haven't tired a wheel with it, but it's got great controller support.Cons:* Some of the events can become repetitive as you try and unlock stuff.* AI isn't perfect.Overall, tons of fun. Definitely worth it if you can grab it in a sale.			",290,44,12,28,50,5,57

												I have only played burnout for a few hours. Now to be fair these off the wall racing games are not really my cup of tea.  I loved burnout 3 takedown. This is nothing like that. This is more race driven game from what i can see. The multiplayer is a bit confusing to get started. I strongly recommend a controller or steering wheel to make it easier.  I love most of the NFS, Forza and Dirt games. However this is not like that.  If you are a Die Hard burnout fan then this may work for you. But not really my thing. Maybe if i  gave it more time. Something tells me that that will not help.			",165,6,7,8,7,2,23

												This game is pretty good; its not like regular sandbox racing games. Billboards, fences, jumps, cars, bikes, traintracks, everything makes this game interesting. you might be able to learn the map, but it doesn't make it easier to navigate throughout it. This is way better than NFS: Most Wanted, but that's just what I think (maybe I just like the radio anouncer that talks to you all the time). Sometimes it may get boring, but turn down the game volume, and just put on some intense music, and you'll feel like your in an action movie. :)			",73,8,2,4,16,0,1

												[Singleplayer]This game brought me into glory days of Carmageddon 2 just because of adrenalin that goes trough your body when u first enter the race. Crashes are beatiful,races are intense, various numbers of cars,bikes and 4x4 jeeps. I would recommend this game to anyone who loves racing and even to those who dont because the game is simply amazing. Also u obtain cars in the most interesting way which im not going to spoil you gotta check it out for yourself.*Flaws*- Although there is various number of cars in burnout paradise there is just something that is lacking so    much, and that is car customization, although you get stock paintings and vinyls i really wanted to  immerse myself even more into this game by customazing my own car.- After lets say 5 hours of gameplay races tend to become more and more repetitive but that didnt stop me from enjoying the game.[Multiplayer]Multiplayer is really awesome u have included VOICE CHAT!!! I was like omg when i first entered online racing because there were so many people screaming and laughing it was just awesome. This type of behaviour really gives you sense that the game is really fun and i enjoyed it as much as everyone else in multiplayer.FINAL VERDICT= 10/10 (even with some major flaws i havent had that much fun since Flatout: Ultimate Carnage and Carmageddon)			",7,0,1,0,1,0,0

												Burnout Paradise is, in short, a feel good game. Criterion Games deliver a relxing, yet boundless experience that can keep one entertained on occasion. The sandboxy, open-world that you are. right from the start, free to roam around in, creates a likening to that of Rockstars Grand Theft Auto. I have seen that some have experienced severe technical difficulties with the game. I, however, have not had a single issue.The game does become a little 'samey' after driving around the map multiple times, Great music though.7/10.			",90,3,8,6,7,2,16

												This is one of my favourite games! I would highly recommend this game to anyone that likes a racing game. Its open world so you drive to find races (which are absolutly everywhere). This games provides many hours of online and offline gaming. Once youve completed the car side of things there is then motorbike races to compete in. The graphics are very good for the age of the game, there is a great feeling of speed. The range of cars is impressive, I think around 70 in totals the range of bikes is a lot more limited.If you like any of the burnouts this will not dissapoint!			",52,3,14,4,3,0,8

												Picked this up to play with some friends and gave it a go solo while waiting for a game night to be arranged, not something I would have usualy baught but actualy glad I did, its a good little racer with open world mechanics and very nice graphics.The Ultimate box comes with a bike pack and some additional cars which is handy, the Bikes offer a slightly varied play style and a new set of races (though as a downside these are all solo, no A.I. involved)All in all , a worthwhile buy, good to play with friends (or online with randoms if you fancy it) and if your bored and dont know what to play, stick on some burnout.The only downside for me is that none of the races are actualy that hard, more of a ""strained"" cruise than a hard fought race.

												Burnout Paradise is a arcade racing game. To ""finish"" this game you need unlock a burnout driving license, but this game you can`t finish, there is so many things to do when you get this license. This game is fun and anybody who like this type of games i recommend to try and play. 8/10 +: -you can drive on all town-still nice graphic -Many cars to unlock -Many race type to play (classic race, takedown, escape race and acrobatic)-Music is to cool in this game (rock, pop, classic and more !) -very fast, aggressive and enjoyable gameplay-in game are motorbikes i like it :)-many billbords and offroad to find- AI is so aggressive, you must be faster then them or you gonna be takedown very quickly.-: -Only 4 motorbikes to unlock :( -No motorbike racing, only time run  -repetitive racing  -small town -poor cars modification -you can unlock new version of cars but they have no difference.

												I've had so much fun with this game.  I truely think that it is a classic that even today looks and plays well.  The game is a blast and I've actually bought it on both PS3 and PC.  Of course the master race iteration is much better, except the online implementation which is very poor.			",156,16,8,22,24,1,27

												A great game if you and a bunch of mates have some time to burn, multiplayer challenges are great fun, you and your mates are there on the spot if one of you either, produces some epic fails at a particular challenge, or produces an unbelievable stunt.  Burnout Paradise makes for some great gaming, especially with a party of 8 players, a great social game.There are plenty of cars, unlockable through your hard work of course.  There are plenty of challenges for as little as two players all the way through to an 8 player party, so grab your mates and get some challenges done. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was fun when I first got it, however there really is no big motivating factor to continue playing aside from obtaining more cars. Repetetive missions, long loading times, and content that was more novelty than anything. This is one of those games that you would enjoy at first, but will regret buying in the later days. 5/10.

												I'll start by saying that I don't really play racing games. The last racing game I've played was Burnout Revenge on PS2 and that was years ago. Before that, it was the GT3 on PS2. When the Origin bundle came out, I had heard about this but I wasn't really interested in it because I had heard it was very different from the older Burnout games. Well, it is, but I still managed to have fun with it. It's not without its flaws, though: the loading times are slow, unlocking every car takes so long and some of the game modes are absolutely boring. However, it's one of the racing games that actually made me want to play it for 30 hours. For me, that's good enough already.			",346,47,25,55,22,2,48

												This game is great.  It's fun to unwind after a long day, just driving around the town.  There's also plenty of cars and different modes (race, stunts, etc) so that you don't feel like you're always doing the same thing over and over again.The only downside I would say is that you can't restart a race through the menu.  That's cool at first, but pretty aggravating when you just want to do a single race and fail.			",316,110,10,37,27,4,54

												I work as a hostess at a restaurant and the other day, I was having a really crappy day. This girl and her boyfriend (maybe in their 20s) come in, with two 10yr olds in tow. Maybe they were baby sitting, or were watching younger sibling, I don't know. But the two younger boys were yelling, beating each other up, and whipping each other with those cheesy, battery-operated Christmas light necklaces.So we do the typical ""Hi, welcome to _____!"" and the girl asks for two kids menus. One of the little ♥♥♥♥♥ kids screams ""And two giiiiirl menus!"" while glaring at the girl and boyfriend. Something in me snapped. I turned to the kid and said, ""That's great because I really like your necklace, you little ♥♥♥♥♥.""The boyfriend laughed.			",79,7,5,8,14,0,12
