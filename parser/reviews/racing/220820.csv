												I didn't have high expectations for Zombie Driver HD, but it's suprisingly good fun mowing down zombies in your car! My fav mode to play is Slaughter (survival) where the zombies keep coming which also has an online scoreboard to challenge your friends. Story mode is repetitive and gets pretty boring; there is a lot of content for the money though! Blood Racing is OK but most enjoyable once you get a good ride. Decent array of weaponry & cars to choose from which are all upgradable (off course :p).

												Zombie Driver is the same for the top-down car racing games as Zombie Shooter is for the isometric style action-RPGs: mindless fun offering you hours and hours of entertainment while ridding the world of a horde of zombies!You play as a taxi driver who is entrusted by the government to complete certain tasks during a zombie outbreak. The story is nothing special but some of these missions can be very exciting - sometimes you can use a tank to just destroy everything that's in your path but even with the taxi cab mowing down hordes of zombies can prove to be satisfying.While story mode can get really boring (you should mainly play it for the money) Survival Mode puts you in a much smaller area and makes you the target of never ending zombie waves. The longer you can survive the higher score you can achieve and you can compete with your friends on the leardboards.Furthermore, in Blood Race you have the opportunity to compete against other drivers controlled by the A.I. This game offers long-lasting, solid fun! You have machine gun, rocket launcher, flame thrower and even a rail gun at your disposal to wreak havoc!This is a highly recommended game!

												This is a strange little game really - it's kind of like super sprint and micro machines but in a sort of open world setting where you do missions which involve driving from A to B and you have to kill as many zombies as possible. Its a great little mish mash of genres to create something a little bit different and it works. It even has boss fights too. It also has a racing career mode too and the races are kinda nuts really as you try stay in front, kill zombies and win to earn more money to buy better cars, upgrades and weapons. The only real con to the game so far is the poor voice acting but then I didnt buy this for the voice acting or immersion really. I just wanted a fun little game to go between other games that didnt require me to amass an encyclopedias worth of knowledge about builds, techniques startegies etc but would let me rip loose and feel like a boss. This game does that.It aint no FORZA but then you don't get to kill zombies in FORZA. brought it on sale - totally worth the money.---- edit --- and still loving it a few weeks later. Ace game to go to everynow and again for thoughless violence			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If lavender tea and deep breathing don't help after a bad day, try this. Mixed with the proper metal this game's survival mode is a great stress reliever. Plus, it throws out achievements like candy making you feel like even more of a rock star. I sat down planning to spend 30 minutes killing some zombies...I walked away 4 hours later feeling as if I had been at a day spa.			",116,24,5,27,25,0,21

												Well it's hard to either recommend this game or not. But since the negative things overweigh, I choose to not recommend this game.The positive things:- Mowing down zombies which explode. Fun!- Bonus for mowing down even more zombies, wohoo!- A game that doesn't need any explanation and is simple.The negative things:- Driving can be very frustrating, since you very often get stuck on some stupid corners. And half of the time you're maneuvring back and forth and back an forth and back an forth, while insulting the bad controls with a very foul language. I'm from Lower Bavaria / Germany, which makes this even worse.- You never see what's coming, since the camera angles (no matter which one you chose) takes away any sight or fun.- Time limits, time limits, time limits. Of course not every mission has to be completed in a certain amount of time, but it's annoying as hell if you have to. Why do game makers don't realize we hate time limits as much as we hate escort missions?- Most of the time you're searching for a route to your objective, instead of just driving and giving zombies some hell. The map is very confusing and of course your objectives are at the most far end of the map. The military has helicopters, but meh, f--- this s---, let's just send a normal car instead. The city's completely overrun with zombies and world is in peril, but that's fine. A normal car will do juuust fine!- The cars are a joke. I understand that you're beginning slowly with a taxi, a limo, a van, and that every car has its specific speed, passenger seats and maneuvrabilty. Thats ok, because one has to begin slowly. But they are boring and it's not really getting any better. No special cars or anything. The bulldozer and the tank, which are FUN AS HELL every meter you drive them, you're only allowed to use in one, maybe two missions. Yeah, just take the fun away from the player, I don't think he doesn't mind at all. Let's tease him with greatness and bash him afterwards. It's like getting the biggest and most-fun weapon of a game and than losing it forever and never being able to use it again.- The ending. Really? It seems the creators of this game lost any interest or motiviation or had been cut really short in terms of available time. It seems kind of unfinished.The things that don't matter:- For a simple game like this it has an evolving story. Which doesn't make sense. Because yeah, let's send a taxi driver in a city overun with zombies to get some crucial things, while the bulldozer and the tank and all the military stays at the base. Are you kidding? Why not a person on a bicycle, just to make things interesting? Yeah, take this, zombie! *bashes zombiehead with club*Things that could make this game awesome:- A camera angle which actually puts some fun and clarity in the gameplay.- More cars / vehicles which also look differently after upgrading.- Cars that feel like cars and not like toy cars or bricks.- The option to buy upgrades before you start the mission. Not finding powerups during the missions.  You can include an arcade mode where this is enabled by default, I'm fine with that. But for story mode it's uninspiring and fun-breaking. Even with the upgrades your machine gun only has 300 rounds - if you pick up the flame thrower, the machine gun's gone. Mission briefing, upgrading the car, killing zombies. This should be the way. So what is the problem? One can never concentrate in mowing down zombies. Instead you're constantly on the lookout for said powerups.Overall, it's a decent little game, which could be an effin awesome game, if they just would have put some awesomeness in it. I did not finish the game and after failing in a mission several times and watching videos of the last missions on YouTube, I'm glad I didn't finish the game. It would be absolutely not rewarding.

												Pretty much the same thing as the non HD version so definitely not worth getting unless you can get it really cheap in a indy bundle which is just exactly how I acquired it. As far as I've noticed all it really adds is some boss monsters in the single player stages. That's about it.If you don't have the original though it's a nice drive and gun game with some cool extra modes that's recommended if that sounds like your kinda fun.			",2189,854,88,271,225,28,361

Fun + When you have killed your 1 000th zombie+ When you have killed your 10 000th zombieNot Fun- When you have killed your 100 000th zombieZombie Driver HD is a brainless top-down shoot-them-up game with simple flawless gameplay and controls. Regardless of the surpriseless storyline I managed to spent hours shooting and smashing zombies wave after wave until I got enough of the slaughter. Fun lasted easily the main storyline though.There is also 2 other game modes. Worth mentioning is the Blood Race where player can compete with another racers with different rules and scenarios - a GREAT shame that multiplayer is not an option and all you compete with is a load of AI.I'd purchase this from sales if I were you but if you really are into some arcade rumble rather sooner you can't go wrong with this.

												Zombie Driver HD: The remake of... Zombie Driver. Both games are mad fun. This one is prettier. Not really a lot  I can say about the game. You are a cabbie who winds up in the middle of a zombie outbreak and gets press-ganged into working for the military. But he gets chainguns on his cab so cool I guess. You shoot stuff and get money. Three different modes: Story, Blood race, and Slaughter. Story you know, Blood Race is best out of X number of rounds tournaments with different game modes and slaughter is arena zombie killing. Stupid fun, moderately easy to 100%. Get it sucka.			",472,69,2,81,30,4,86

												In ZDHD, you are Joe Citizen who, for reasons unknown and never really explained, has been recruited by the military to conduct a series of combat, scouting, and search-and-rescue missions. The first ten or so story missions of Zombie Driver HD were fun and the last twenty-one generally vacillated somewhere between tedium and entertainment, with a couple of teeth-grinding exceptions. Most of the components of a good game are here, but none of them stand out in any way, which makes the whole more-or-less precisely the sum of its parts: a mediocre story, weak voice-acting, decent but not remarkable gameplay, nice car models and (mostly) destructible terrain, and some value-added game modes.Your missions start with briefings, like the one shown above, after which you select a vehicle and buy any upgrades that you can afford based on what youâve unlocked so far and how much cash youâve earned from completing objectives or finding money stashes. ZDHD is one of those top-down games where you never get out of your car. The variety of vehicles, ranging from your starter car, a taxicab, to a giant armored vehicle with a 10-passenger capacity, is fairly impressive, but when you dig into the game youâll find that youâre really only using one or two of the vehicles in your garage, generally a compromise between carrying capacity (most of your missions involve rescuing scientists, first responders, or civilians with special skills such as pilots) and durability.The upgrades available for your vehicles fall into two categories: weapons and modifications. Modifications affect a specific vehicle only and are these: armor, speed, and ramming (the last of these represents a vehicleâs ease of turning intact infected into smears of roadkill). Weapons include such items as machine guns, rocket launchers, flamethrowers, and a rail gun, each of which has three power level upgrades. Weapons are provided in the form of âpickups,â meaning that you drive over a weapon to equip it and only one may be equipped at a time.What story there is in the campaign unfolds largely through the mission briefings and monologues by survivors that you pick up and bring back to base. No explanation for what caused this breakout of zombie-ism is forthcoming although itâs evidently some kind of bio-toxin, and the military has you picking up various groups of folks to assist in containment and control efforts. Many of these groups will question (as you, the player, no doubt will) why the military is sending a lone, untrained civilian to perform these dangerous tasks and some will hint that the military is somehow behind the zombie plague, but whether these are the ravings of a paranoid few or glimpses of the truth is never made clear.Once youâve completed (for me after about 10-12 hours) or gotten tired of the story mode, there are two other single-player modes to explore: Blood Race and Slaughter. The Slaughter mode is basically a horde modeâyou have one vehicle and you pick up powerups and kill as many waves of zombies as you can before your car is destroyed. Blood Race felt a bit like a less-fun version of Death Rally: you compete in a marathon of eight events composed of âeliminatorâ (destroy a target number of enemy AI vehicles before time runs out), âenduranceâ (survive as long as you can with a bomb on your vehicle by passing checkpoints to add time to the countdown), and âraceâ (what it sounds like). The race sections arenât really up to DR because destroying an opponent only takes him out of the race for as long as it takes for him to respawn and most of the tracks are very curvy. Even using a gamepad, the steering for most vehicles is very slippery, so sliding around corners isnât really an option for novice racers.If you like top-down driving games and hate zombies, you may enjoy Zombie Driver HD. Itâs not a great game but itâs not a terrible game and thatâs about the best faint praise I can give it.			",493,326,17,119,88,8,165

YouTubeâ¢ Video: Cheap PC Games: Zombie Driver HD ReviewÂ 

			Views: 299		

			http://store.steampowered.com/app/220820/		

In the world of video game most zombie games are in first, third or isometric view. You take control over some human, but in how many you can drive a car and slaughter zombies? Not many. This is the thing that intrigue me here. And the game is properly named â Zombie Driver.The game have a lot of video option. Except resolution you can find clouds, bloom, FXAA, fog, V-sync, SSAO, fullscreen and shadow type. Despite all those settings and the HD in the name, the game is not that good looking. It's not ugly, just okay. But to be honest most of the times you won't even notice the graphics quality, because there is a danger to be surrounded by zombies and you will drive all the time. The bad texture mostly noticeble when the game stop you to show something. You play as a nameless character, a taxi driver, that is caught in a city during a zombie outbreak. He now have to do the military's job. Why? No one knows. Even in the game is mentioned that. To story is the worst thing here. It's not worth paying attention. You do few things here to progress it â save someone, clear a place to move the base, kill something that spawns zombies, plant a gas sparying device and the game is over. Some of the people that you save are saying things that are making hints for something deeper, but ultimately the story goes nowhere. Do some missions and get out of the city.I don't mind a bad story if the gameplay is good. Here it's just that. The controls are fine. I try controller, but I end up playing with mouse and keyboard. With them it's much more fun. You start with a your taxi and by doing missions you will unlock more vehicles and get money. The cash can be also earned by driving through zombies and break what can be break in the world. With the money you will upgrade your cars and weapons. The upgrades for all straightforward â more ammo, bigger explosions, faster car etc. So pretty much that's it. You drive around, kill zombies, get cash, upgrade vehicle. You don't have all the weapons in all the time. They are on the ground spread around the level and you have drive through them. And all are useful. The thing I found is you need a truck that can take a lot of damage and have good ramming points. After that other vehicles are useless, at least to me. I played with Auroch through most of the game and the only time I change it is when I need to save more than 10 people. For those cases I used a bus, which is pretty decent. The speed of both vehicles is fast enough. The map don't have many places that you can drive really fast. The vehicles have the tendency to fly in the air when you hit a wall. So for me there is no point of using some of sport cars. They can be destroyd easily.From time to time the army gives you a different vehicle â tank or a bulldozer or a truck. This is a neat idea to change a little bit the gameplay. Beside the main objective you have a secondary. It's wise to do them, because you get more money or car or something else. But ultimately the missions are as I mention above â kill, save or destroy.There three bosses in the game and all are fun. They have some similar attack and you circle around them and shoot them. Near all the bosses have those places that spawn zombies constantly and it's wise to destroy them first.The world is really great. It's not a huge map, but it's big enough. It's very diverse â train stations, houses, industrial zone, suburban area and so on. There are a lot of shorcuts that can be found and it's helpful know them in situations where you are in a hurry. Almost all objectives have some sort of time limit.Sound design is okay. Shooting, engines, explosions and other effects are good, but the music is not memorable. It adds a little bit tension, it's fast paced, it's sometimes orchestral, it uses a lot of drums and guitars. It kinda remind me of Resident Evil the movie soundtrack and Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2. It's a game about shooting zombies and I don't excpect creepy music. I want high octane tracks and that's what i've got. But it's there somewhere in the background. Sadly I can't point one track that stands out above the other.Voice acting is bad, especially the people you save. They are all steriotypes you can think of â gamer, scared scientist, obnoxious  politician and so on. I know, the focus of the game is the gameplay, but the problem is you can't skip any dialog.It seem so far that I dislike the game, but actually I don't. I'm just a little bit disappointed The game for me is just okay. I really like to run over zombies or to blast them to pieces, but the main campaign gets kinda repetetive, but thankfuly it's not that long. I took me around 4 hours the finish it. There is too many minor things that annoy me. Beside the campaign I have problems also with the weapons. They are only four. Don't get me wrong they are all great, especially when you upgrade the rockets and railgun, but they are only four. When you combine all this with the bad voice acting, the repetition, it's brings the game down for me. But there is one saving grace â the Blood  Race. It racing with other cars and zombies on the road. I had so much fun shooting other vehicles. There are 3 different type of races and I like all of them, especially the Eliminator. Here you have to destroy certain number of cars for a limited time. You can shoot them, you can ram them or combination of both. As a conclusion I would say I recommend the game, but on sale.

												If you liked driving around and killing people with your car in GTA 1 & 2, you might take a pleasure in playing Zombie Driver. You've either got a machine gun, a flamethrower, a rocket launcher or a railgun mounted on your car. You even can choose your vehicle, e.g. a taxi, a sports car and not at last a tank in story mode. Beside the story mode, which is not that challenging, there is a racing called Blood Race and a survival mode called Slaughter. All of those are fun and the game itself is just about fun, it is certainly not a high-class game. Despite the variety of three playable modes, the game is rather short. Nonetheless it is worth buying, especially on sale.			",41,12,0,1,9,0,6

												This remake of Zombie Driver adds some new content and modes to play, though the modes are kinda useless the base game itself is still very enjoyable and fun.  A top down isometric GTA style view except now with more zombehs.  Choose diff vehicles and enjoy mowing them all down.  The plus for the remake in HD is the controls work much better instead of the confused mess they were in the last version.  The tournament mode is sorta meh, rubberband racer AI, weird things that make your car flip over or spin around.  Ignoring the modes which are a failed experiment, the game itself gives what all zombie fans want more of, more zombies!  Lots of replayability with mission select so you can test out all the cars to get your zombie fix.Rating:  10/10  Value:  $9.99			",2654,1119,101,266,362,29,398

												How many ways are there to kill zombies now? A lot more than there needs to be, thatâs for sure. I was socially inept enough to jump on the zombie bandwagon before it was cool, back before 28 Days Later and the Zombie Survival Guide brought them back from their long post-Thriller twilight. Iâve cooled on them enough that zombies as a bullet point is more likely to drive me away from a game, so keep that in mind while I explain just how much I enjoy Zombie Driver HD.The main draw of Zombie Driver is the story mode, posing you as a nameless motorist in a city beset by the undead plague. Every mission takes place on the same wide-open GTA-style map, sending you to different areas to rescue survivors, destroy zombie strongholds, or defeat enormous bosses. Ramming is sufficient to splatter most zombies but for bigger targets there are weapon pickups scattered all over, giving you machine guns or flamethrowers to cull the hordes with. Youâll also find repair pickups (which you will need because damage can come in huge bursts) and money, used between missions to upgrade your cars. And that is cars plural, because you unlock sports cars and limos and police cruisers over the course of the campaign. Thereâs not a lot of variety in the missions and the characters are all voiced so badly itâs funny, but they make simple excuses to run over thousands of zombies.The driving really is the best part of the game, appropriate for a game called Zombie Driver. Your vehicles are different degrees of responsive but all are fast and all make satisfying messes out of the undead. Youâll fight different kinds of zombies including dogs and giant exploders and worse, and they all erupt into fountains of giblets and leave crimson streaks on the pavement. Itâs a viscerally satisfying game, even if the sound effects arenât always up to the task of capturing the slaughter. Weapons do tons of damage and clear out crowds, and you get mounting monetary bonuses for long streaks of carnage. Much like in Carmaggeddon, Itâs easy to lose track of mission objectives just because youâre having so much fun roadkilling things.The HD in the title does indeed mean this is a remaster of a previous Zombie Driver, but with more going for it than just prettier graphics. The campaign is longer, with a full 31 missions and several new bosses to battle. There are new vehicles as well, which can also be used in the gameâs Blood Race and Slaughter modes. Blood Race is, again, much like Carmaggeddon where you race against other cars, crushing zombies and blowing up your opponents to progress. Slaughter is you against mounting waves of zombies with its own progression system of weapons and upgrades. Youâll find plenty to keep you busy as long as you enjoy plowing through zombies, and when itâs done this well thereâs really no reason not to.			",488,212,8,71,62,7,65

												-ZOMBIE DRIVER HD REWIEW-This game is not bad.There is long Story Mode Stages and Blood Race Mode Cup events to get some action and Slaughter Mode to teste your drive ability and experience in this game.If you have gamer soul you can't get bored while playing this game.Different Cars to drive and you can upgrade them that sounds good.Also you can try to reach high rank at leaderboard on all stages and modes like you want but i need to warn you i said ''if you have gamer soul you cant get bored white playing this game''before.Yea its true but this game is kinda slow like not a normal race game or different category car game maybe cause it's a 2nd person strategical driving game that makes it slow i thinkSo is it worth to buy it?Maybe yes or no but you can try it anyway if you liking to climb leaderboards in different games Drive to your best score Good Luck :)My General Point To This Game:5/10			",317,60,13,31,19,7,36

Twelve hours of work and I still can't sleep. Damn. Days go on and on. They don't end.â Travis Bickle, Taxi Driver (1976)And still too many zombies to run them over ;)After 16h (one-time story, all-gold Slaughter mode, all Blood Race tournaments):PROS+ immersive (don't know why: :P)+ nice graphics and effects+ mixed vehicles+ Slaughter modeCONS- average-bad cameras  in relation to the game's speed- sometimes really freaking annoying- cut scenes that can't be missed and which also consume missions' time- even if the mission doesn't have a concrete time limit... suprise, countdown continues- main campaign is little too long, because missions are repeated- final boss with regeneration- Blood Race (Race is good, but Eliminator's too chaotic and Endurance... strange mix of time driving and killing zombies)- a few minor bugs Subjective rate: B- (this game doesn't deserve either the thumb up or thumb down. That's the truth. It's in the middle, but really only for z-fans. Or Carmageddon/GTA1&2 veterans.)			",87,29,1,10,3,2,13

												So far I've only played through a few hours of the story mode so this review relates to that. I'm looking forward to trying race mode later.I always have a nostalgic hankering for a decent top down driving game but am usually disappointed. Zombie Driver HD however is fantastic fun..   Rich environments much of which you can destroy, engaging story, awesome voice acting (in the best B movie tradition), convincing hoards that can swamp you if you're careless, great explosive visual effects, quality audio and HUGE zombie bodycounts.While you are required to develop a certain amount of driving skill it should'nt be too frustrating for novices of the top down style. missions can be completed at a slower pace, sticking to the streets but don't worry about leaving the road, the maps are sensibly designed so you don't constantly get stuck on scenery or in dead ends. As you become skilled with the handbrake you'll be pulling donuts and rail gunning through hundreds of bloody undead.The different vehicles work well and purchaseable upgrades mean you're always tempted to stray from the mission to grab extra cash found around the city.The atmosphere created in the game is great, weather changes, night time lighting, the army presence, shadows of jet fighters roaring overhead, vehicle getting covered in blood and a constant tension created by time critical mission elements all add the feel of this great little game.One thing I would like added is the ability to move the camera a little to scan the environment. Playing with an xbox controller this seems untuitively what the second stick should be used for, although it's arguable that you shouldn't be able to see much further than the street you're driving in.So in my opinion the developers have done a great job of creating a top down driving game set in a zombie apocalypse, if that sounds like something you need, you should probably grab it in a sale like I did, or at full price if you're feeling flush.FUN.

												So close to being an awesome game. Manic zombie killing vehicular apocolypse, but the six inch visibility means hitting every wall in town, and the ten mile turning radius means each kill is annoying to go back for, and the two seconds of ammo capacity means guns are a pipe deam, combined with unskippable bad voice-acting... so close to awesome, but not quite.

												People are often surprised about the amount of time I devoted to this game. The concept is not very complex here - you drive around, smashing zombies and surroundings, sowing destruction and collecting upgrades to your car and momey to buy even more upgrades.Can this game be any good? Definitely! It's one of the games that I spent most time playing. It has some storyline, but it's not the reason you play this game, is it? I play it when I feel the need for speed and destruction without excessive brain exercise. In fact you can freely relax your brain in this game, you will be using your eyes and fingers, but won't need to plan any complex strategies. But when you play a game that is all about driving into hordes of zombies, can you expect anything else?			",166,8,12,16,11,3,15

												Just drive back and forth until it feels right. When that doesn't happen, go make yourself some french fries and just keep goin until the screaming stops. When you're done with the fries, keep goin until your car is upgraded enough that you no longer slow down when the zombies become to thick. Do not play this game in real life unless you're sure there are zombies out on streets in your city. Apparently the military is too busy to kick some zombieâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ so they have enlisted you to run over some zombies using all sorts of zany vehicles with many possible upgrades.

												(Updated 29/10/16) ... Added Video.There are two fundamental flaws with this game...1) It's not multiplayer. I say flaw because if this game was multiplayer, I am pretty confident none of us would ever play another game ever again except this one. Explosions, endless bullet spray, flames...flames at the corner of my brain, fodder, more flames and a laser which basically just punches a hole through an entire city block. Now all that control in one mans hands is fun, place it in three, have a timer and endless enemy spawns and you have a pixelated armageddon catering for an endless maniacal laughter.2) There is a scientific equation law here which is never broken. The equation is this... Zombie + Speeding Car = Tomato Sauce. Problem is not everyone likes tomato sauce. Some like Bbq, others go for mayonaise, some like wasabi and some boring people dont want any sauce at all. Since the developer/s do not want to limit their audience they should really provide an option in game where you can either change color of sauce, or even have the option of 'no sauce'. Maybe modders can come to the developers rescue on the second point since the game has been completely opened up for them to run mayhem. Personally i like to place several sauces at the same time on my fodder, so give me white, red, green, in fact even make a rainbow sauce please so i can really paint the town.Basically the story mode is rather linear in the way it plays out like carmageddon, so that you run over various zombies picking up people from various locations in the city. Each time you pick someone up you get treated to a small dialogue of the story which more often than not pokes a bit of fun at itself and the zombie game genre providing some laugh out loud moments. But it does become a bit stale after a while because most of the levels are basically the same thing over and over. You just grind away making money so you can buy more cars and upgrades. Most of the zombies really do the same thing, they just cause your car's health meter to go down when they hit it while your standing still or if they throw a projectile at it. It doesnt take much intelligence to find the zombie spawn points which are usually a converted zombie bus, or a massive zombie hive and blow it up first. There is one zombie which really is a major pain though and thats the fat zombie, which is somewhat parroted from the 'boomer' in 'left for dead' if he gets close enough to your car he will explode causing massive health damage to your car if your still within his blast radius.The HD graphics in this game are TRULY AMAZING. I found myself a number of times just parking and looking at the beauty around the place regardless to the fact that I was being pounded into the concrete. I just had to look at the houses and green houses and go 'isnt that pretty, go away zombie leave me alone i'm admiring this flowering bush'...The other grand mention of this game are the two other modes. This is where the game REALLY shines. First there is a Slaughter mode where its your job to last as long as possible driving around a small map collecting upgrades and money as the waves of zombie spawns slowly get worse each round. There is an achievement to last for 30 waves. This is really challenging and more often than not personally found that my car was exploding into tiny debri even around wave 10. Place this mode in multiplayer and it would be awesome.Second there is a tournament mode. The tournament caters three events.1) Blood race. Race around a track against challenging ai racers poling for first position.2) Endurance mode. Race around a track by yourself, trying to hit the checkpoints in time against a devilish timer.3) Elimination mode. Race and blow up as many AI cars as possible.Again if all this was in multiplayer it would bring back the feeling of the good old days of 'rock and roll racing' google it.Seriously enjoyed the graphics and the fun of the modes, just really, really wish it was multi player and could turn off that damn red color and change it to pretty rainbows. Still recommend, but if you don't like tomato sauce I would give this one a miss until modders or devs give more options.Finally here is an interesting video which shows the evolution behind Zombie Driver HD so far...

												The Story: Basically those lovely Government Scientists have been having some creative fun with their chemistry sets. Causing a lovely accident that has turned the inhabitants of an entire city into shambling aggressive Zombies. Which of course you are asked to kill as many as you can while doing missions for the military.Game play: What can I say. Its top downish drive shoot and ram to kill zombies, while doing missions. All good ol fun if you like killing zombies. The Graphics: They are simple and good enough in my view for the game. But for those who are picky and want things looking really like real life then this would probably effect them. But for this game I say its just right.Controls: Controls are simple nothing to hard to learn. SWAD for movement LMB for shooting and RMB for Nitro. Petty simple there is other combos for the the controls as well as game pad. But I just stuck with the Keyboard n mouse. Still fun with them.The Music: It does go nice with the game. It even had the feel of some older games, the names escape me at this point though. It certainly fits the style of game.The Reply Value: With the other game styles you can get and the dlc. There is some reply value in it. Plus am sure the any zombie killing lover will reply it a lot.Bugs/Glitches: I could not see any bugs or glitches that could effect my game play of this game. But remember that's not saying that they might pop up for others. But for me none what so ever.Overall: Its a fun zombie killing game, with some nice graphics that suit the game. Easy to use controls, music that go's with the game in my view. Certainly has reply for those zombie killing lovers. No bugs or glitches that I can see. Story was to me generic, but that's me. So in my view this is a nice game to play. So I give it a 7 out of 10.			",209,83,4,67,38,3,57

												I'm not the world's biggest fan of driving games.  And surely I'm not the only die-hard horror fan who has to started to grow weary of zombies.  But this game is actually fairly awesome.     Beautiful graphics, logical maps and understandable physics.  What more can one ask for in a game where the objective is to drive over and gun down hordes of zombies in heavily-accessorised cars?  If there's a better zombie-driving game out there, I'd sure like to see it.  Good, unclean fun.Verdict: 9/10.			",744,417,6,57,40,5,78

												This is an excellent game for whenever you have the urge to kill hordes of zombies. The vehicular-based mechanics set it apart from the average zombie game but the familiar weapons are at your disposal - minigun, flamethrower, rockets and more. There's a bit of story somewhere in there too, thought I didn't pay much attention to it. It isn't perfect but it's certainly fun. Highly recommended for fans of the zombie genre, especially when it's on sale!			",132,36,1,17,9,2,22

If you're anything like me and have difficulty getting it up for games that don't have a nice fat achievements, this game will be your mistress. I beleive this is the only game I've gotten 100% on, but I havn't been hunting on PC long, as I believed Steam lacked incentive to obtain achievements. I recently discovered the achievement percentage, and mine was 22%. Pathetic.

												Simple premise - zombies have resulted from a large explosion at a corporation trying to cure cancer, and everyone is infected. You are a talented driver (I guess) and you are recruited to help out the army as they try to evaculate or establish a base. Missions are fun, fast and filled with satisfying gibbing of zombies everywhere. Typical mission is going to pick up a few specific survivors to help build the base (Doctors, Shipcrew, etc) or going to defend a specific objective. There are secondary objectives, and the game does a good job of mixing up the mission objectives. Simply put, this is a great game to sit back and relax with, slamming into a billion zombies. I have only played the Campaign so far, but there is two additional modes to the game! Really excited to dive in further. Absolutely worth the price paid.TLDR; Fantastic fun arcade driver game, in the vein of Carmageedon and others. Splatter zombies, equip and upgrade vehicles. 8/10			",549,126,11,66,95,4,87

												[NOTE: All of my reviews are based off of value for money/comaparison to price. I purchased ""Zombie Driver HD"" for 69p with a 90% off voucher.]To start.This is one of those fun little games that you would play when you don't have enough time to play a missoin on a bigger game but want to play something. (Damn those poorly timed meetings.)Story:A zombie acopalypse strikes. You are a taxi driver in a large city who is saved by the army. However, the army is limited and you are needed to assist in rescue efforts and clearing zombies out of certain areas. You car can be outfitted with various weapons and armour types. You can unlock new vehicles by completing secondary mission objectives. Gameplay: There are powerups/healthkits/weapons that you can collect around the map in a mission to make it a bit easier. You can Run over, Burn, Shoot and Blow up as many zombis as you can.There are also minigames such as races and wave survival. It is fun to play for those timess you are bored and want to play a full campaign.			",65,13,2,6,2,1,7

												I have a soft spot for top-down racing/driving games, and Zombie Driver has to be one of my favourites.It's fast, it's fun, there's tons of blood and gore, some of the missions are genuinely challenging, plus the HD version looks pretty damn good even by today's standards.I'm not nuts about the few timed missions, but everything else is awesome. Especially the extra modes and races - the devs didn't NEED to include them, but they did!Oh, and expect some cheese - the voice acting and overall plot are both laughably terrible, but in that old B-movie kind of way that's more endearing than annoying.Definitely worth the money.

												This game is an outright blast! Nothing beats using a car to mow down some zombies in a very well-detailed world. You can play in story mode, Blood Race and of course slaughter mode for some quick & awesome zombie killing. Well worth a buy for some casual play and it even utilizes nVidia's PhysX.

												Great Story, but repeats it's missions pretty fast. Many Vehicles, extremely huge masses of Zombies and nice weapons for every situation. Also a great Race Gamemode with destroying the other racers and a Arena-Survival Gamemode where you can try to survive. (Obvious, isn't it? xD)I recommend this game for friends of Racers that like to drive over zombies in a bird's eye view.			",114,15,0,13,7,2,7

												Zombie Driver HD as the title says is a game about driving. And the problem of driving game is that most of the time they gets boring real fast. I like that game, the music is good, the graphics are pleasant enough but there are lacks of variety. You just spent 90% of your time to go pick some guys up or to destroy something. That's the main problem of the game. Another problem is the scrolling speed. When you pick a fast car and if you use turbo it is going too fast and you don't see well what you're doing and where you're going. However, I still find this game fun. It's a no brainer, that's why and I like the idea of blasting away zombies with a mounted minigun, laser, rocket on a taxi,bus,limousine etc. But one thing I don't recommend is to buy it full price.

												For the cheap price of this game and the level of fun you'll have, you might be quite surprised when you play Zombie Driver.  Its basically what you might expect in terms of its name but just the realism and fun you can have with the vehicles alone is great mix. Along with a few interesting extra mini-games to keep you going.  The game has alot of heart to it and the overall control of the vehicles is based upon the vehicle itself or how you read the city and not from bad game mechanics.  You might lose a few times in some levels, but the overall result of this game definitely made you feel like a total badass zombie killer.  And isn't that what we all want? ^O^			",91,12,0,7,3,1,14

												Surprisingly fun! I didn't expect much from a game where you just drive around the whole time, but through fitting audio, brutal animations, powerful weapons, massive zombie doom-bringing tanks, and fast paced action, this game makes mass zombie squishing extremely satisfying. ""Slaughter"", a wave-based survival mode, brings all of the weapons to your disposal early on, like the super powerful railgun, making normally repetitive zombie smashing very enjoyable.

												Never played the original, so no comment on how this is or isn't a dev/pub cash-grab, but this game scratches that car combat itch. Lots of repetitive zombies and sound effects (and poor voice-acting), but the positives are a nicely-bombed-out lookin' city, and a good range of cars and weapons at your disposal. The different game modes (story mission, racing, and survival) help mix things up, and a bunch of not-unreachable achievements is always a bonus.			",2550,1061,87,281,336,29,415

												I actually really like this one. Not sure if there's anything bad to say about it. It's not your Triple-A title with a rich plot and surprisingly innovative gameplay but I don't think that it intends to be that. If you want to let off steam, this is it. Kinda like Nation Red, only in a car.Quality is also very good, visually and technically. Oh, and good controller support; playing it with a Xbox 360 controller.One of the few games I like to get back to now and then and still enjoy it. Recommended.			",152,16,4,5,8,0,8

												So far for my first 30 minutes this game trows me instantly into a zombie mess, after that there is no tutorial (-1 point) and you must learn the controls from the settings, the game mecanics are impresive plus the graphics are good enough and working good witht the blood decals, the weapons are ranked to bad to better like the flametrower, can do some damage to the big zombies but not for a long range but shorty it will ran out of amm and than we have the rocket launcher that has low ammo but massive damage and explosive radius.Upon this game basics, this gem brings you car and gun upgrades, not so good because they kinda are unlockables and that means they can be unlocked trough the story, the enviroment is very fascinating plus that weather and day/night system makes it look even gorgeous and they couldn't just leave the game only with zombies by their selves, they added freaking BOSS fights, the controls may not be that easy while trying to aim your weapons but it's worth the try.I feel like I haven't payed enough for this game, still haven't enough money in wallet xd.8/10 will run into zombies if I had the chance in real life, wish me luck.

												Blood, cars, guns, cars with guns, explosions and, of course, zombies! What' not to like about this game.It has a decent campaign (4-5 hours), although it is kind of repetetive (no more than 5 type of missions), but every single one is satisfying. The weapons feel great, the driving feels good and the camera may make you dizzy at first by there are 3 more option to change to.      *You have to play the game with a gamepad. The keypord controls are very clanky.Apart from the campaign there are to more mods to play, racing with others through zombies, and surviving waves of zombies.To sum up, fun game, worths the money, use gamepad.

												Zombie Driver is a damn good game, but if you read my recommendation for the original version, you knew that already. This HD version adds some choice features like rechargable turbo, boss fights, an extended story mode, and a guest appearance by the van from L4D's Crash Course campaign. It's a classic top-down driving game in the vein of Death Rally or the original Grand Theft Auto, with plenty of fast action, violence and fun to spare. It's a simple pleasure with no multiplayer, but it's got a triple combo of story missions, races and survival modes.  If you didn't play the original game, then this is the version to get. So strap in and gun that engine, those zombies aren't going to splat themselves.			",332,6,5,16,2,1,15

												Do you like racing games where you get to shoot guns? How about running over hordes of squishy enemies? You can do both these things in Zombie Driver HD. This is the re-release of a 2009 game with improved graphics and additional content, and while the game seems to have mediocre meta ratings, the user review scores on Steam are very positive (in the 90âs). The game was released on consoles like Xbox 360 and Playstation 3, but the Steam version seems to have a lot more achievements than the console ones (more than 100). The gameâs story is actually very rudimentary, where all you know is that some sort of disaster has occurred, creating zombies all over the city. The opening and closing animations are like motion comics, where they just kind of zoom around on a single painting (not really movies). This means that you mostly pick up the plot from the intros to each level, where your commanding officer gives you your orders. Itâs worth noting here that the voice acting is pretty bad, and has some grammatical errors and misplaced emphases. Itâs not that big a deal since the game is mostly zombie squishing, and the story is just for adding flavor.Zombie Driver is a top down car shooter where you drive around a large city map infested with thousands of zombies. There are about 30 levels in total, and the game âworldâ resets between each mission so you can grind for money or achievements if you want. There are only 4 different types of weapon (machine gun, flame thrower, rocket launcher, and rail gun) and the ammo is scarce enough that you canât just drive around firing wildly. Fortunately, most of your kills will probably be from squashing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥es with your ride. Things like ammunition and repair kits respawn every few minutes so if you take your time, the game is actually pretty easy. Thereâs no way to change the difficulty, by the way. By completing side objectives during certain missions, you can unlock different cars to drive, each with different stats for speed, armor, and ramming power. If you have the DLC, the best car for most of the game is the Auroch truck. Vehicle upgrades are separate for each car, so you donât want to spend all your money upgrading your early cars, but the weapon unlocks/upgrades carry over for all cars.As for the enemies youâll be facing, most of them are weak shambling zombies that barely slow you down as you trample over them, but after the first few missions youâll meet the guy that makes you drive cautiously all the way to the end of the game â the exploding fat zombie. Heâs pretty much the only enemy you try not to run over, and this prevents you from just holding down the nitro and boosting around the map. There are also a few bosses to fight, but theyâre basically all the same in gameplay (rooted to the ground throwing stuff at you). Since health and ammo pickups respawn on the map, you can use hit and run tactics on bosses, and run away to heal if youâre about to die. Pros:+Very nice gruesome graphics for such a small game. I think it was about 1gb to download.+Fun for casual zombie squashing, and if you want, you can replay levels youâve already beaten (but these donât âsaveâ meaning your main campaign save file doesnât keep the money found or cars unlocked from level replays). That means the only real reason to replay levels is to unlock achievements.+I enjoy games where you can (but donât have to) grind for money to buy persistent upgrades. I originally thought this game was like the Alien Shooter / Zombie Shooter games, and it kind of is similar in the way you take extra time on each level just to look for extra money to buy upgrades.Cons:-The game gets repetitive by the middle of the campaign. Every mission is basically the same (clear out the zombies in a particular area) and it all takes place on the same map. The enemies donât get any stronger, just more numerous. At least the map is big and youâre constantly upgrading your cars.-The game camera swings wildly at times since it seems to be on a slight delay. This means you can do a sharp skidding turn, and a second later the camera rotates 180 degrees. I didnât get a headache playing the game, but I can see how it would bother some players. Thereâs also a bug (possibly intentional) where itâs possible for you to get âstuckâ on certain obstructions. Despite being a top down game, you can still make small jumps if youâre going fast enough (like hitting a wall at full turbo speed). This means once in a while youâll get stuck on a wall or a fence and need to restart the level. Itâs really annoying if youâve already completed the mission objectives and are just running around looking for money before ending the stage, suddenly you get stuck and have to start all over again.-The âstoryâ is pretty generic and predictable, so donât play it for the story.Overall Zombie Driver HD is a great game if you enjoy top down shooters and mowing down massive hordes of weak enemies. Seriously, by the last level you probably canât go half a screen without running over a dozen zombies. If youâre just playing for the Steam achievements, I can tell you that about half of them are pretty easy to acquire, but the other half require a lot of grinding (kill 10,000 zombies each with machine gun/rockets/fire, etc.).  If you have half an hour to kill (literally), you can beat one story mission at a time until you finish the campaign and move on to the other 2 game modes: Blood Race and Slaughter. Blood Race is an actual racing mode, unlike the main game where itâs just you vs zombies. Think of it as a top down version of Rage racing, with machine guns and missiles. Slaughter mode is a survival game where you try to live through rounds against increasingly dangerous waves of zombies (more fat exploders). ",653,205,34,57,43,12,102

Tons of fun to play and even good single-player story campaign. Only problem I had is I need a standard game controller with all functioning buttons, which this game is going to make me break down and buy, since I really want to play it more, but it gets too difficult to use keyboard after the initial missions.

												Apogees Duke Nukem Death Rally meets Rockstars Classic Grand Theft Auto.Top down car driving gun blazing zombie killing goodness.Played the original a what seem like 6 ish years ago ?, and to be honest didn't give it much thought, it was ok but found it fiddly with a keyboard and mouse. Skip forward to 2015 and I picked up the ZD HD complete pack for just over Â£2 and have been playing it nearly 5 days now, this time however with an xbox controller.In short the game visualy looks very nice, easily some of the best ""indie"" game graphics available even against 2014/15 offerings. SFX compliment the game well nice solid sounding guns and squishy zombie splatter under the tires. Heavy Metal BGM during the survival mini games gets your adrenalin pumping but is less suited perhaps to the missions of the main game, it is good but can become repetative. Voice acting ... well at least there is some, lets just say it doesnt add nor detract from the game, and I've defo heard a lot lot worse. Game can be tricky to control with kyb and mouse and is definatly easier to be prescise with a stick controller like xbox/ps3 controller.Main game offers 31 missions each taking between 3-10 mins to complete on your first play through, each with highscore tables and secondary optional missions offering limited replay value but atleast it has. These can be replayed in any order, using any car you have unlocked with ay upgrades you have unlocked making a replay easier to obtain a better score or to do secondary missions.Survival mode offers erm.... 7 ish arena maps with the aim to survive as long as possible with waves or increasing numbers and toughness of mobs, earning upgrades each wave to assist you and random weapon and bonus score drops. each map having its own high score tables. This is easily the most fun mode and will keep you playing for significant time after having completed the main game. To be fair some of these maps can feel a little small or tight to move around and can feel like you are just driving in a circle, but most are nice arenas with multiple paths to manouvre around.Race mode, this is somewhat similar to a classic game Death Rally from the 90s, I havent played much of this so far but is a series of tournaments made up of a set number of events, such as race, checkpoint and elimination. This can be a little frustrating as it is very easy to get stitched up right at the end of an event after leading 95% of a race. This mode seems to be 75% player skill and 25% luck.Money spent on car and weapon upgrades from the main game are for the main game only, in the main game new cars are unlocked through playthrough. In survival upgrades  are earned in each game for that game only by completing waves cars are unlocked in this mode by unlocking them in the main game. In race mode cars have to be unlocked with money, money earned and spent on cars and upgrades in race mode is for race mode only. I can not comment of the race mode achievements, however achievements for the main game are not difficult to obtain. There is one that you should be aware of before starting your first playthrough which if missed will require a full 2nd replay.... which is probably best as it will be easier with some experience having played the game, and one that will require a little skill and luck and several play throughs requiring to complete last mission with less than 10% health. The survial achievements are easily obtainable and fun to boot. With my limited time spent of race mode, I do not think they will be too hard just frustrating needing several replays that will take time, depending on skill or rather luck.Perhaps the best thing about ZD HD is whether you have 5 mins to play a game or 4 hours, it will keep you entertained and survival mode will always suck you in for just one more try.If your paying full price just pickup the main game and the Apocalypse pack well worth the money. If its on sale then buy the complete edition, either way this game is easily a must buy for your collection.***EDIT***Just a quick note, system specs are i7 4500HQ, 16gb, R9 265x and game runs fine at max settings 1080p, a little slowdown ( just dips below 30fps ) at points in a couple of the later missions, no slow down on survival or race modes. Accidently run with onboard 4600HD for the first couple of missions and would be fair to say it handled max settings well around 28-38 fps but would be fair to say later missions would pose a problem given the 265x diped below 30 at times, should be ok on HD or HD+ however with 4600HD.

												Zombie Driver is a damn good game, but if you read my recommendation for the original version, you knew that already. This HD version adds some choice features like rechargable turbo, boss fights, an extended story mode, and a guest appearance by the van from L4D's Crash Course campaign. It's a classic top-down driving game in the vein of Death Rally or the original Grand Theft Auto, with plenty of fast action, violence and fun to spare. It's a simple pleasure with no multiplayer, but it's got a triple combo of story missions, races and survival modes.  If you didn't play the original game, then this is the version to get. So strap in and gun that engine, those zombies aren't going to splat themselves.			",332,6,5,16,2,1,15

												I am such a perfectionist anymore, that I dread the thought of writing a review. So many things to cover, and then I feel bad if I forget something. So let's just get right into it.Zombie Driver is -at first glance- a cheapo top-down racing/casual game. Even worse, it's one SEEMINGLY trying to cash in on the zombie craze that hit the world a few years ago (in gaming, movies, basically EVERYWHERE).But fortunately, Zombie Driver is actually a good game. Not just kinda good at what it does, but GREAT at what it does. Quick, satisfying game sessions full of enough speed and destruction to...just...let you take out your frustration. I can't explain it. For a game, Zombie Driver is just bloody good at getting rid of my stress!There are 3 different modes, all of them serve their purpose. Generally speaking, Story mode is for when you have time. Slaughter and Blood Race modes are for when you're in a rush (but still want to de-stress).Achievements are plentiful. You'll probably get an achievement every session. Out of all the times I've played, I can remember only 1 or 2 sessions that I haven't gotten at least one achievement, lol. It's just another way Zombie Driver adds to its satisfying experience.About the only flaw I found in this game was the way the weapons work. In which, every time your drive over a weapon pick-up, say bye-bye to your previous weapon. It's funny because it took me a while to even notice this -since the game is so fun and fast paced- but once you realize it's happening, it does kind of detract from the experience. (Anything that takes control away from the player is usually a bad thing.)But all in all, Zombie Driver HD is a great little indie game and one that deserves more attention. I think you have to go into it knowing what to expect, but if you need a quick little stress reliever game and are fine with Indie game graphics, I say you NEED to give Zombie Driver HD a try.PROS:short play sessions. 5-15 minutes for a single race or single session of Slaughter mode.			7-25-ish minutes for a Story mission.GREAT stress-relievermultiple modes: Blood Race (Racing), Slaughter (horde mode w/ 1 life), and Story modeStory is well done, complete with voice-acted dialogue throughout the missionsAchievements are plentifulNEUTRAL (Good or bad depending on how you look at it)BLOODY! -some people may not like the excessive blood (and some gore?), but I didn't find it too disturbingNo aiming cursor -NOT a big deal, but perhaps worth mentioning in case you were expecting itplenty of pick-ups -including plenty of weapons, Medic (Health) packs, and Ammo packsCONS:Can carry only 1 weapon at a time. (Each weapon picked up replaces previous weapon)No multiplayer/co-op(?) This game is so good that in some ways it's a shame it doesn't have any multiplayer modes ",257,22,12,21,8,0,7

												HD version of the original with quite a few improvements. They've basically fixed everything, and improved the quality of the effects. I noticed slight graphical improvement with the environment, but not much. The dialogue was barely fixed. There were still parts where I was like ""Skip...Skip...Skip...COME ON!"" I want to *hick* run this *hick* game into a *hick* wall sometimes...... *hick* Seriously. Drunk people don't do that or sound like that. STOP IT!Missions were improved, and I don't remember the original having the huge boss fights which can actually be challenging towards the middle of it. I also got the DLC with the car and the truck. The truck helps a lot, but you'll also have to upgrade the dlc car if you want to beat those timed missions with... *hick* time to spare. *hick*One of the things people wanted was multiplayer, and I'm really hoping to see that in a possible sequel.

7 Years old this month....Zombie setting aside I think what separates a game like this from say a game like the SEGA published Renegade Ops is just that, published by SEGA.It's 7 years old, the steam store trailers don't do it any justice, it has a name like a generic F2P mobile game, deliberately? cheesy voicework (much like Renegade Ops) and a camera which should come with an epilepsy warning but it punches well above its weight. Slightly less polished than Renegade Ops but makes up for it in gore, charm & pure fun and has heaps to unlock and do outside of the campaign.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The title of this game basically tells you all you need to know about the gameplay: run over zombies with your selected vehicle. You run over zombies or kill them with weapons attached to the vehicle while completing primary and secondary objectives in the story mode.The story mode has a basic plot that is very typical for zombie based games, not ground breaking. It looks like another apocalypse. Your mission begins with a briefing from General Blofeld that you must clear out an area filled with zombies or rescue certain people who are being overwhelmed by zombies. As you go about your mission, you run over zombies while your vehicle gets covered in blood and earn combo bonuses. These combo bonuses continue to multiply if you continue to mow down zombies in a bloody mess, something like chaining your matches in Audiosurf. The top-down perspective looks like the first 2 Grand Theft Auto games and the action looks like the Carmageddon series since you are constantly causing a bloody good time around town.The weapons are scattered around town and all are pretty useful. They include flamethrowers, machine guns, railguns, rocket launchers, and nitro. All weapons can be upgraded using the cash you earn from each mission completed. The nitro really speeds up your car and helps you reach your destination faster, but it is also useful in getting out of a tight situation when being overwhelmed by large numbers of pedestrians that could potentially make your car explode.Vehicles are varied and range from taxis to buses. Some vehicles are more useful than others in some missions. The military may ask you to rescue 8 people in a given mission, so the best vehicle could be the bus because it has a carrying capacity of 48 people. All vehicles can be upgraded for more speed and better ramming ability. Even with the variety of weapons at your disposal, ramming zombies with power slides and using nitro to go full speed ahead is still more common than shooting.The zombies range from regular zombies to exploding zombies. The regular zombies are small or medium in size and there are many zombie dogs run over. The real challenge comes in the form of exploding zombies. Exploding zombies are the fat zombies who can detonate themselves when they get near your vehicle. You can be earning great combos while killing 300+ zombies, only to be ruined by a group of 3-4 exploding zombies who commit suicide next to your vehicle, causing it to explode.There are a few bosses to battle in the game. These bosses can only be defeated with enough firepower using the various weapons in town. It is also necessary to use defense by running away from them when they are ready to attack. A lack of defensive moves will lead to certain death. In addition, the zombies will never leave you alone during boss battles. So, while you are running away to restock ammo the zombies are chasing you. When you are firing away at the bosses the zombies are still attacking you.There are other modes in the game that add to the zombie splattering fun. There is the blood race mode and the slaughter mode. The blood race mode is about tournaments that require you to compete in different events such as races, eliminator, and endurance and have bronze, silver, and gold medals available. Races require you to finish 1st for gold and you can destroy vehicles by ramming them or with your weapons. Eliminator events require you to cause as many wrecks as possible while going through checkpoints to increase the time remaining. Endurance events require you to drive around with a bomb stuck to your vehicle going through checkpoints to increase the time remaining. The trick in Endurance events is to kill zombies and destroy as many objects as possible to contribute to the time remaining. The slaughter mode is a good old fashioned zombie killing, splattering entertainment. It is all about killing as many zombies as possible from one wave to the next until your vehicle explodes.The graphics are decent and, while not dazzling, they provide a well-detailed environment. The death animations look cool and make you feel like it is so much fun making your vehicle all red in blood and guts. You can hear the zombies writhe in pain very loudly when you splatter them all over your vehicle or when you blow them away with your weapons.The vehicles handle well, as the physics feel realistic during the times you have to turn and perform power slides. They also feel realistic according to the type of vehicle. The muscle car feels very fast whereas the bus feels slow, but very powerful for ramming zombies. The super car feels like it is both fast and powerful since it combines all the great attributes of speed and power.Some may be disappointed by the fact the Zombie Driver HD has no multiplayer. True, there is more replay value after playing the story mode because of the blood race and slaughter modes. However, those who love multiplayer action will not have any opportunity to compete in multiplayer mode.I think Zombie Driver HD is a lot of fun to play. The story mode feels a little bit short in length, but it is still entertaining enough. The blood race and slaughter modes provide more entertainment and replay value for a low price of $9.99. All the zombie crushing and splattering fun makes this game worth your purchase.My Score: 7.5/10 ",190,18,0,4,7,2,6

												the video shows it to be great, but the reality is that you can never really drive fast and ram zombies. the controls are so clunky, the game is too easy, and the cars drive way faster than you can possibly comprehend the map that is loaded with obstacles. if you play this game your time will mostly be spent bumping itnto walls and trying to turn around or changing from drive to reverse. its such a shame that a game can fall so ahrd on the basics like controls. maybe its because i played on keyboard, maybe not. also you cant change any graphics settings.

												I thought this would be a great game, going around using your vehicle as a weapon and killing all the zombies.  However, everything in the game is against you.  When driving, you have to collect fuel, health and ammo, but you don't know where to find these meaning you run out of fuel or ammo, or your health does down and you die.  You can either try and rescue the survivors but with not enough fuel, or you can try and find fuel but then there is not enough time remaining to rescue the survivors.  Some of the zombie groups must have hundreds of zombies in, and even with a tough car, you car easily gets damaged.  Then there are super zombies who will damage your car even further, and even throw objects at your car!  At least make the zombies realistic, not super thinking toughened zombies who will seek out objects to throw at your car!  The graphics are awesome as very detailed, and in theory this is a good game, but in practice it is awful.  You end up keep being killed which puts you off playing the game any more.

												Ive finished the main story now.  Almost a good game... Some fun, but the Cut Scenes are the MOST ANNOYING I have EVER seen.  You cant skip them, even when repeating a mission.  I cant believe that they would put such a stupid restriction on the game (and from what I have heard, they WILL NOT change it, despite many complaints).  They are TERRIBLE.  The voice acting is poor (it comes across as cheesy / fun the first time or two), and the cut scenes ruin the pace of the game.  Not to mention the stupid difficulty changes in each mission.  And Im SICK AND TIRED of every â¥â¥â¥â¥ing mission being timed in one way or another.  Create a game that is potentially fun, then not allow you to actually enjoy it (except in other game modes maybe).  Would have gotten an 8/10, but I have to give it a 6... it does its best to ruin the long term (replayable) enjoyment of the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have mixed feeling about this game, overall it's good but not very well done, I'm reviewing it with all dlc available.  Edit: I have beat the main story so I think I should update this review pro :- good music- stunning graphics- ram all zombies and blood everywhere- good game without thinking muchcon:- there are not much content in this game so the game feel very much repetitive, I played until the very end of the game and the last 2 levels are very predictable- the survivors that looks like asian has russian accent :D ( I think it was on mission 28 or 29)- feels like mobile game with controller support, i don't know why, but it just feel that way- the plot is kinda stupid, till the endm why a taxi driver do everything and army sit behind desk. I meant the story is pretty much predictable- I hate the zombie that can throw things, i just don't make sense at all, I keep thinking when playing where they get throwable things and able to throw like 50 meters away -- and when there are too many of them and you don't pay attention you will die almost instantly from themother:- GPU intensive, my notebook was overheated while playing it for hours :D- CPU intensive too starting on mission 25++- The apocalypse DLC ruins the game because new player like me didn't know anything about the game and we could pick truck monster that was overpowerful for early level. - stupid ending, doesn't explain anythingfinal score 7/10 (it was 6.5) give 0.5 because at least they put something new for the last mission			",563,208,7,55,32,3,69

												This game is a really great new twist on a classic style of game.  The old game series where you'd fly a helicopter around, saving guys with your ladder and fighting enemies all over the map as you did little missions.It's like those old games but with a slightly customizable car selection and zombies.  Grab it if you like zombies and see it on sale, it's a very fun smaller title.			",164,21,0,36,34,1,38

												Visually cluttered to the extent that I couldn't see the track clearly enough to drive round it competitively, so either the game is too fast paced, or the track needs to be more clearly defined.Gave up before realising that I'd driven the same race several times and that I was supposed to select the next one. It's not the worst game on Steam, but it didn't draw me in as an intuitive and fun experience. It's rough around the edges, but atleast it's cheap and works.			",328,38,37,15,49,2,50

												Really fun game, as long as you can ignore the storyline, which makes no sense at all.  Basically you're a survivor in the Zombie Apocalypse.  The city streets have thousands of Zombies roaming around.  You are a civilian, you start with a basic car that can run over zombies.  You earn money doing missions, which you can use to upgrade your vehicles with higher powered Machine guns, flame throwers, rocket launchers ect.  The game is not open world, but mission based.  You have to rescue people from these areas before they are killed by the zombies, so on a time limit.  Some are more open missions where you need to make it to different supply points clear the area of zombies, then get the supplies.  Or some missions are just to clear a zombie outbreak and survive.  The game is a top down style.  Controls are straight forward.  There are power ups located across the map for Car repairs, or ammo for your different weapons.  But Ammo doesn't stack.  If you just loaded up your rocket launcher, then picked up ammo for your machine gun, your vehicle switches to Machine guns, and your rockets disappear.As for the story line.  I wish they got rid of the military.  Would be alot better story if you were with a small handful of useless survivors.  Instead you have a fully functioning military base.  They have tanks, Choppers hovering above the base to secure it from any zombies coming to your camp.  There are survival critical missions to save certain doctors, engineers needed for the bases survival ect.  But instead of getting out the tanks, or flying over to the boarded up houses with a chopper and mowing down everything in site, they send the lone civilian in a sports car with limited weapons.  Eventually they will start letting you get some military vehicles.  All in all, lots of fun to play, lots of action and mass zombie deaths.  Big explosions and Blood smeared all over the city.

												Very entertaining game. Has 3 game modes and multiple vehicles. Story mode has 31 missions and they are kinda short. Race mode is a little difficult on my opinion, but fun as well. Slaughter mode is great but a little exhausting. The gold score is high and you get points very slowly. But you get used to it and actually don't even pay attention to the score while playing. Really enjoyable.  Better than I expected. Great addition to my library.			",1417,868,47,59,173,20,153

I've never seen a game like this with such a large amount of small annoying problems that all add up to one big disappointment. I was constantly shaking my head and squinting my eyes in disbelief at the stupid little ways in which they did most things that they could have done differently/better. It's too bad, because in the hands of a real game company that knows how to make a real game, this could have been great. Or actually probably not since it's vehicle combat meaning you only fire in one direction: forward. Then you back up, reposition, line up, hit the brakes, turn around, speed up, reposition more and â¥â¥â¥â¥-all else to get more shots off in a straight line before quickly having to do all that again.There are a ton of other problems with the game but it really isn't worth my time talking about it in detail. The bottom line is that this is just not fun for long because of poor design concepts and new flaws popping up constantly as the game progresses.5/10			",598,87,12,48,22,5,43

												What a terrible game.Firstly, the map has too many things I collide into. In a game like this, you'd expect to be driving around at high speeds, mowing down hordes and hordes. But no, instead when you navigate around you must take your time and try not to ram into every little thing! It slowed down the game so badly, and this has got to be one of the worst parts, since the 1 hour I spent was carefully driving slowly, so I don't bump into something.What about the other 30 dreadful minutes I spent? Well, let's say it was just killing a few zombies here and there, but it wasn't exciting in any way. Just shooting them, drive away, shoot, probably run over them a bit, it wasn't too satisfying really. The bosses were also ridiculously hard for some reason, I just stopped though by the time I killed the 1st one, it was so boring.Oh yeah, I completely forgot there was a story that was just shoved in, trying to interest you, but it didn't. At least they tried to make one though, but I would've prefered nothing.I hate this game. I spent a dollar on it and I still regret my decision.			",118,14,0,15,7,2,4

												This game is more of an arcade type of game with not very many upgrades. Also the gameplay wasnt even that great. Honestly the only slightly cool thing in my opinion is  the zombie bosses. This is more of a game for people who like a challenging driving game and pick up upgrades on the side of the rode. Personally I dislike it and I didnt know what I was expecting when I bought thankfully I got it when it was on sale for a cheap price but I still wouldnt suggest it to anyone of my friends though.

												Awesome game!!! Sometimes, it reminds me of Land of the Dead meets Death Race! Lovely blood gore gameplay with tons of achievements to unlock. Graphics is also good. No need of high end gaming rig to run it smoothly. If you like to play zombie killer games with set of wheels, this is the perfect game to choose from. I'll rate this game 10/10. Highly recommended during Sale.			",115,27,2,12,9,0,11

												TL;DR: Take the fun of Carmageddon, the viewing angle from GTA (the original ones) and strap weapons on your taxi and you're good to go on a quest to save the city.In Zombie Driver (HD) you are some dude who drives a taxi. Military (""if they even are the military"", says the random hippie) enlists you to save a bunch of civilians in a zombie infested city. Mow those zombies! Mayor will pay you a bonus for their smashed bodies! Gruesome, silly kind of humour is cultured in the overly dramatized monologues everyone else gets to give you when you meet them.Zombie driving gets a lot more fun once they strap a machine gun to your car. Later, you'll get equipped with flamethrowers, rocket launchers and even experimental rail guns that shoot blue, helical rays of mass destruction. Not to forget, a tongue-in-cheek car game wouldn't be complete without a turbo booster. Between missions you get to upgrade your cars (new ones unlocked every few missions) and weapons.There are no surprises in the zombie varieties: in addition to the regular, shambling corpses, there are legions of zombie dogs, wailing slingers of industrial junk, bloated monsters of the exploding variety and of course the hulk. Naturally, it is more difficult to ram the bigger ones and especially in large groups.Story mode has two kinds of basic missions: 1) taxi missions: go and save people from buildings around the town (usually with generous time limits), and 2) slaughter missions: go somewhere and kill everything. Here, everything includes the zombie spawners (introduced by the HD version): enormous Jabba the Hut creatures that blurt out more of the monsters (it figures that these are not your average zombies after all). In addition, there are the awesome cleaning and destroying special missions where you get to drive e.g. tanks, with infinite ammo of course. HD version also has a couple of bosses that add nicely into the game's limited lore.Story wasn't the strong part of the original Zombie Driver and it has only been patched partly by the HD upgrade. It ends abrubtly but rather appropriately although leaving your contribution vague: it is unfortunately never explained why the army (or whatever they are) needed a random taxi driver to sort their mess.Two other game modes are more like what the game was designed for: there's the copy of Death Rally called Blood Race (though you can't destroy your opponents permanently) with several different tournaments and challenge missions. Unfortunately, career mode is missing. You'll get money for winning races and can then buy limited upgrades to your car. On the other hand, Slaughter mode is an endless killing spree of perpetually spawning zombies for higher points to show off in the leaderboards. Here only death ends the level.Game is fun and pretty awesome. However, it is easy to get stuck in corners and sometimes it is not clear what items can be driven through resulting in further stuckiness. Mob spawning can be ruthless and illogical, especially in Slaughter mode: zombies tend not to walk as fast (or at all?) when you are not seeing them in front of you in the camera and the game considers it fair to spawn a group of exploding zombies right behind you when you are reversing.Despite the few complaints, I can give it thumbs up. Graphics are nice, sounds are not irritating and gameplay is very nice (I used keyboard and mouse). Also, the improvements from the original Zombie Driver are very welcome: e.g. they made booster a separate item from weapons, added a map and made the story mode more interesting with the zombie spawners, bosses and special vehicles. If you have doubts but are interested, you can also grab it on sale for 2 euros or less.			",3008,1259,77,374,380,26,452

												This game is a lot of fun.The missions tend to be rescue survivors or destroy this and that or collect this and lastly defend that.However when your on the missions the zombies become quite the pain in theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥enough that it keeps you playing. I dunno if I would get this for a $10 but its worth buying the game at whatever price you feel comfortable with. Game is loaded with driveable vehicles and you can upgrade things nicely. If you like some driving plus zombie killing,this game is not a bad fit. Not the best,but good times.			",380,74,14,73,45,5,92

												This remake gives the player everything what a good remake needs to.Better graphics, added gameplay elements with extended storyline (awesome new vehicles and boss battles), while keeping everything what made the original so entertaining, so if you enjoyed the original game or the demo of this version, give it a try!Also this review was written some time ago and in the earlier version I was complaining about the really frustating (minutes length) loading times, BUT it seems like that the developers have fixed this issue with the DLC releases, so Thank You dev people for not letting this awesome experience be ruined by some stupid glitch. Now I can actually enjoy playing the game without worrying about that loading back the main menu will take effing 5 minutes.P.S.: You can also drive a tank (not always of course, that'd be way too easy) to wade through the hordes of zombies. If THIS can't convince you, nothing will.			",92,19,1,1,5,0,6

												I payed 2.99 (complete edition) 0.4h on record atm, but i have to say thats totally worth it. Reminds me a little bit a game from '97 IGNITION (lots of hours played on this game xD), similar camera (not because the zombies hehe).			",563,137,37,58,60,10,58

												So I got this game because I got a coupon for 50% off and thought why the hell not. It's been a pretty fun game so far but I have to say the gameplay is not that versatile. The missions u have to do are pretty much the same the entire time. You either have to pick up some survivors or destroy some zombie nest. And at times it feels more like your just focussing on collecting health and ammunition for most parts of the mission. The game on the other hand reminds me a bit of the very first GTA, and who doesnt like a bit of nostalgia.			",559,146,21,47,34,7,60

												Simple mindless fun.Just drive around and mow down zombies.Car mechanics are well made and fun. Objectives are decent enough.  Not much to the game but does it well enough for the price.Figured i needed a game like this for when the mood stikes, would recommend for others in need of a top down arcade game like this.

												Zombie Driver HD is a very simple but yet brilliant game and well worth the cost, it is basically a small 2d zombie driver/killing game in which the aim is to save innocent people from the zombies and get them back into safety and kill many, many zombies overall i would give this game a 7.5/10 for its brilliant planning and gameplay.

												An honest brutal title to this game that you can't help but admire, The game that wastes time deliverying or experimenting with some new turn on dispatching contemporary gaming's most overuse ememies, It's basically just you and your car on a familar birdseye view format nostalgia on the early years of Grand theft Auto and the whole population full of zombies and some surviours in the whole state. Over the course of the game you smash through them causing a lot of destruction with weapons and choses of cars and school buses, fry them with flame throwers and rocket launchers and leveling up as you proceed further in the game. The game itself is quiet imaginative and creative all around, it's stupid and unrealistic, gory and quiet fun.			",113,13,1,2,4,0,0

												Not that bad once you configure the camera angle & controller setup as per your preferred playstyle; although I would highly recommend using a controller. The only annoying glitch I could find was getting stuck between tight walls and gaps, but considering the gameâs story can be completed in less than 6 hours I can only recommend this game on special.

												Gave it a shot- it was $2.49... its ok. cars handle differently, and hitting zombies with them has impact. Racing mode was fun (single player only). i didnt try the arena mode. Story mode has zero variety, but thats forgivable i guess, you drive around killing zombies and pick up powerups and upgrade your car. the thing that makes me NOT recommend - is that i break out into cold sweats from getting dizzy while driving. i think this may be due to the camera... if i played this for an hour i think i would throw up and need to lie down. i dont know - that may be just me... but other top down games like Nation Red or Gatling Gears, did not make me feel this way. too bad. it had some things going for it. maybe playing a mission once in a while or playing a race when waiting for a download or something would be cool. i also liked that it had full controller support, thats always nice to have in a game. But overall - if you are sensitive to cameras spinning without your input- i would avoid. EDIT: OK i went back and tried 1 more mission - with the 3rd and last camera option.... Free Camera mode is a little better. And the game threw a Defend this Area type mission... but its still made me dizzy a bit. I think the camera is too close and has to adjust itself too often since you can be driving quite fast. so yea.... i still would not really recommend.			",372,108,15,46,32,5,73

												put guns on your battle cars so you can kill zeds while you kill zeds. f#ck yeah!i loved the original release of this game and the 'HD' steam release is even better. now there's not only the story mode but also race, destruction race and survival.i focused on the story mode and only played the other modes for the achievements but the other modes certainly aren't bad. it never hurts to have more options to extend your playtime and increase the value of the game.the story mode includes quite a lot of levels and they offer a decent variety of  missions and side missions. plus you can finish the missions and still drive around for a while to kill some more zeds and increase your reward. with a fine selection of cars and weapons it just never gets boring. the other game modes are pretty much self-explanatory.there are some DLC for this game but they are not essential and you don't need them for the achievements.i completed the game 100% after little more than 19 hours and it was just as big fun as the original release.if you like cars and guns and want to kill some time and zeds then you really can't go wrong with this game.

And if you get bored of that there is the racing and slaughter mode to top it all off! Hours of fun and a game you can come back to when you get a bit bored.Would recommend to all gamers out there! - 10/10			",167,35,4,20,11,1,19

												This game perfectly blends old school top down GTA with brutal mass zombie slaughter. You drive cars equipped with machine guns, flame throwers, rockets, shock weapons nitro boosts and more. There are plenty of weapons, vehicles and game modes to choose from. The great thing is that for those that grew up with GTA 1 and 2 on the playstation 1 there actually is a 'retro camera' mode where the free camera will fix itself just as the good old days.The game is only 10â¬ and when on sale it goes down to 3â¬ INCLUDING all the DLC. This game is dirt cheap even at 10â¬. The story mode is well thought out, voiced, filled with multiple giant maps and a wide variety of different missions. On top of the pretty extensive story mode there are a ton of challenges, zombie killing combo modes and even races! The death races are crazy fun and brutally hard and those alone will keep you busy for quite a while. What's even more incredible is that for that small price tag, you don't only get a game jam packed with content, it actually looks really damn good too! Better than most more expensive games.It's seriouslt almost a crime not to pick this up, especially when you are running into it when it's on sale.			",126,21,4,8,3,1,5

												I just want to say that I am pleasantly suprised at the fun this game has provided so far. I really didn't expect much going into the demo version when I downloaded it and played it. After playing the demo I rushed over and bought the bundle pack. I would most definantly recommend this game to people who want a break from the high budget blockbuster titles. On a scale from 1-10 I give the game about 8			",546,123,9,88,97,10,68

												Stories boring as hell. The only good thing about it is races and survival mode. The driving is okay i think it could've been way better but it seems to control okay. The game is worth full price if you're a dying to buy it but if not dying wait a while. They also made the game with fun little weapons like rockets, railgun, flamethrower not but least a minigun.

												Sweet Jesus.from the wiki:""Motion sickness or kinetosis, also known as travel sickness, is a condition in which a disagreement exists between visually perceived movement and the vestibular system's sense of movement. Depending on the cause, it can also be referred to as seasickness, car sickness, simulation sickness or airsickness.[1]Dizziness, fatigue, and nausea are the most common symptoms of motion sickness.[2] Sopite syndrome in which a person feels fatigue or tiredness is also associated with motion sickness. Nausea in Greek means seasickness (naus means ship).[3][4] If the motion causing nausea is not resolved, the sufferer will usually vomit. Vomiting won't relieve the feeling of weakness and nausea, which means the person could vomit until the cause of nausea is found.""Well, ""the cause of the nausea"" has been found and its name is ""Zombie Driver HD"".Seriously, if you were to design a game to cause ""a condition in which a disagreement exists between visually perceived movement and the vestibular system's sense of movement"", this would be it.Zombie Driver HD, is basically a vomit simulator . .  . in HD (or should that be ""stimulator""? I dont know. I've just been playing it, so im fairly disorientated).I would highly recommend trying the demo before you buy, as watching the trailer does not do justice to the epic degree of nausea felt while actualy playing.Then again, you might, (like I did), think ""â¥â¥â¥â¥ it. It looks cool. Im getting it.""More power to you. You too can be the ower of the most powerful ""multicolour yawn"" inducing set of camera options in gaming. ",55,5,3,2,8,0,0

This is the HD version in all it's glory. What's not to like about shooting/mowing down zombies in glorified souped up vehicles. This is a blast. - Enjoy!			",1016,194,27,62,74,1,89

												Sure, it's another zombie game, but this one is actually quite good! Top down driving and gunning fun, for a good price and a relatively compact gaming experience. I wiped out the original in about 20 hours, so I expect this HD version to give up 40 hours of enhanced and added play.Tip: if this is still like the original, it might be a good idea to hold off all upgrades in the story mode until you unlock the discounts. Going to find out for myself.Recommended for single players.8 / 12			",721,226,15,79,62,10,111

												I had really high expectations for this game because of its awesome ideas and sweet trailer. I was sadly disappointed.The game seems to be a cheap port of a mobile game, with car handling very suited for tilt controls, or at least a gamepad, but certainly not a keyboard. The gameplay is dull, and early on too difficult. The voice acted cutscenes seem too long and there is no way to skip them, forcing you to endure their pain.Overall, do not buy this game on Steam. Even at 50% or 75% off, it is a rip off. It's probably on some sort of app store somewhere, go buy it there.			",153,34,12,19,31,3,23

												Quite a fun and entertaining zombie-slaying car game. It's a top-down view (so it makes it hard to navigate unless you stare at your radar 24/7) action-packed apocalypse slaughtercity of bullets, fire, explosives and plasma. A very entertaining game for when you just want to chill out and blow everything up. And for some reason be satisfied with such a bloodfest. Well, if you have a huge bloodlust and like cars, then this game's probably for you.The only con I have for this game is the forced top-down view and the voice acting.			",196,43,12,17,11,3,12

												This games was great on my other laptop.  However my new laptop has a Nvidia Optimus chipset (Intel + Nvidia).  If i launch the game with the integrated Intel HD4600 it start and runs, but cannot keep up.  If i launch with the Nvidia card I get the configuration utility which only shows the Intel HD4600, if i try to launch I get a Microsoft Visual C++ error.  There have been multiple threads about the issue, i have tried all possible solutions but no luck.  This has to do with the video card (and the fact the configuration utility cannot even choose my Nvidia card).  My setup works on all 40 of my other steam games without a problem (even tried the Nvidia on Monkey Island, a little overkill but it still works).The game itself is fun an brillant, however due to the fact no one with the Nvidia Optimus can get any support from the game developers i would not purchase this game (there was just an update in August so the game is far from abandoned).  If they fix the game i will change my recommendation.  However seeing as though i cannot play it i would not recommend to anyone else to purchase.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I recieved a coupon through crafting a badge that showed me this game.It actually allowed me to get this game for a dollar.I was pleased - an inexpensive game with an interesting and fun sounding idea and an equally interesting and fun looking trailer? Sign me up.No no no, wait, take my name back off of that. Now. I changed my mind.First impressions told me that this game was goign to be fun, to be interesting, and be overall very enjoyable.It isn't. The controlls make the car hard to manuver, amn near impossible to kill anything with, and overall, it simply feels broken.I figured, then, with the story mode being lackluster, I could probably get some enjoyment out of the Arena mode. Locked in an arena with a near endless supply of zombies. Just you can your car to fight them all off... Sounds good, right?Just as boring. Jombies drop like rocks at the touch of your car, and do almost nothing to it. I started the first arena in hard mode - ten minutes later I got the gold medal by doing nothinbg but holding the fire button and driving in circles.Terrible game.			",327,70,3,49,33,2,32

												Had a 90% off coupon, so I got the game for $1. Man....what an entertaining $1. I don't even like the whole zombie genre of games. But this somehow managed to keep my attention for 3-4 days till I beat it. The voice overs are hilariously bad, which adds a little humor to this simplistic drive-around-kill-everything game .

												A surprisingly addicting shoot em up game, (or run em over, if you will) that is viewed from the top down. You complete missions to rescue survivors in your car that has been modded with armor and weapons, all the while killing zombies and monstrosities. The voice acting is a bit shoddy, but the simplicity of the game could have done just as well without a story at all, so it is fine in my eyes. Outside of story mode there are also races with leaderboards, as well as a survival mode. All of this is very re-playable.			",176,32,8,18,16,3,29

												It's a decent game, it's not the best of it's genre but it's a good when u just want some mindnumbing zombie crushing action, its fun to mow down a huge horde of zombies or destroy stuff with the bulldozer, missions get repeatitive tho and their isnt much depth to it other than a really basic upgrade system. but overall its a decent game, worth getting on sale			",332,35,17,26,10,1,30

												Honestly, this game is not great but its not bad either. If you just want some mindless top down driver combined with zombies, go for it. It will get tedious over time so I ended up playing a few missions and then coming back to it months later. There are a few different game modes: story, races, etc. each of them are quite good but you will find yourself playing a few hours and getting fed up.			",149,17,3,22,4,1,20

												To be honest, I wanted a Netrual button over here, its unffair to say that this game is crap, but there are some points that avoid me to enjoy this 100%Tobe honest I have played only the single-player campaign. need to say that for cons this game is well balanced, has a fair challenge, great graphics  and has a nice twist on the over-used zombie formula.But the game has some very annoying issues, first of all the campaign drags itself far too long. 30 levels with many many missions types repetead over and over again,how many scientis do I need to rescue ?

												Zombie Driver HD is a Driving game in a zombie apocalypse Theme and reminds alot of the driving in Gta 2, You Drive around in a small part of a City through the whole game and complete various mission and side mission through the game to unlock more vehicles and powerups.The gameplay is very simulare to GTA 2 drivning which isnt a bad thing but it can get a bit hard to se where you are driving and often leaving you whit a litle to no time to do a fast manoeuvre to avoide exploding zombies. The game is still kinda fun and you need sometime so think before you start a mission because all car's has it specific rolle in the game, Some cars are fast but weak, other cars are strong and can surivive strong assults but are generally slow and some car's can carry alot of people in rescue missions.You unlock New cars and uppgrades by progressing in the game and by doing side missions gives you an extra reward. There are about 5 types of mission, Rescue Mission which you pick up diffrent survivors mostly at diffrent lokations, Defending mission where you protect small objects from zombies, Destruction/Cleaning Mission where you mostly get a diffrent vechicle from your standard Garage (might be a tank or a bulldozer) where you need to destroy objects or clean an area from zombies, Delivery/pickup mission where you drive an unarmed truck and pickup/deliver crates and the last mission which is Boss Battle where you need to kill  one ugly mother f****.Only downside is that the camera angle... it tend to leave you short sighted and almost impossible to avoid zombies when you drive fast vechiles.Most Zombies through the game are small and does not damage your vehicle beside one exploading zombie who tends to spawn in the direct path you are driving which mean if you drive in a straight line you are gona hit alot of exploading zombies.The Story in the game is almost nonexistent and you can guess how its gona end half through the game. You only get a few dialoges when you rescue people and at the start off evry mission but nothing to give you the exact facts about the Zombie disease and what happend to the town.It is a bit of a shame that this game is a singel player only title when it has the potential to be a multiplayer fight race game.The game provided some fun and i strongly recomend to use a controller when playing it. I give it a score of 5.5/10.			",312,49,7,43,18,4,41

												Not gonna lie. I just got this game for the cards. lol. It's a nice indie game. A little Twisted Metal mixed with a bit of Killing Floor, pretty fun game.  So far I am liking slaughter mode more than the story mode. Story mode starts off slow. Gotta go fetch people who are in trouble and bring them back to the military base. You get a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ car and do all the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ work while the military has tanks and choppers, as they sit around and let you do everything. lol. The voice acting is pretty bad, but it's expected from an indie game. The camera could be better. If it was angled so you could see a bit more straight ahead and wasn't so high, it would be great. I'm constantly driving into walls and houses. It's hard to drive around and look at the mini map to see what's ahead. I never get motion sickness, but after playing this game for a bit, i definitely got a bit of motion sickness. It's because the camera is constantly flipping around while you do turns.Overall, it's a fun game. Has room for improvement.			",327,78,17,34,33,3,36

												It honestly just feels like a mobile game. The game is so bland and uninteresting and it's so fast paced you don't even know (or care) about what you're doing, whether its finding a survivor or just running over zombies (basically the only two things you can do in the game). That being said, all you really do is  run over zombies and  try to steer a car with a wonky turning system. This is literally a game about driving, they could have at least gotten that right. The game looks good and all, and the achievements seem like they would keep the repetitive game alive, but all and all, it just isn't fun after 10 minutes. It tries to tell a story but 20 minutes in you'll be scratching your head at the pathetic dialogue and nonexistent ""plot"". You just drive over zombies. It's not god-awful, but even on sale for $3 I want my money back.			",151,25,2,7,17,2,8

												It's worth the price if it's on sale. I just came back to this game to review it and saw it's on sale for 2.50, so that's a good price. The full 10.00 is a bit high though. Actual multiplayer races would've been fantastic. The dialogue makes me think it was written in another language and translated back to English. Mechanics and the game itself were fun though. I liked the tropical map, in fact, the graphics overall were wonderful! Some levels felt like they were designed to punish you for even trying to beat the challenges set up for you. But you know what? I had fun and I think it's worth it- on sale that is. The assets were well done and woven together, but the story was a mess... my review is as messy as the experience I had.

												Very enjoyable game, it's a top down car based arcade title where you have a story mode, races, and my personal favorite, slaughter mode. Campaign is you're a cab driver during a zombie outbreak and you complete various missions, races and wipe out hordes of zombies while progressing and unlocking new upgrades/weapons for your vehicle.Race is pretty much what you'd expect except (fun words to use in sequence) you can blow up your opposition to set them back/eliminate them and there are zombies on the race track.Slaughter is a mode where you survive/wipe out as many zombies as you can in timer based waves earning weapon/repair/cash (score) drops. Various maps you can unlock based on doing well in previous ones+new cars to unlock via the 3 modes and a score board leads to an addictive ""Beat your/friends high score"" mentality of old school games.I only have less than an hour on the PC version  (picked it up for $3.74 on sale) but I have 20+ hours on the xbox one version (paid $15 and don't regret it).The game runs well on my potato so no complaints there. Fun way to kill time/hilarious game to watch via broadcasts.			",99,8,0,15,4,0,3

												Is this a good game? Well, you get to run over zombies... which is delicious.What I am disappointed with though is the people behind this.  Instead of just updating Zombie Driver, they went and re-branded the game as HD, updated and improved upon the game with some new content, and sold it for another $10-15.So while I consider that a crummy move, the game is still good.

The graphics aren't phenominal but they work for this type of game.My only gripe is the fixed, top down camera which makes it hard to drive really fast and plan out where you're heading.If you don't have a lot of time to play videogames, this is great for a quick fix.

												A real joy to play.  Those of you who have played GTA2 & Nation Red can imagine that the gameplay is a mix between those two games.  Not quite a brainless top/down shooter, this game needs you to use just enough brainpower to keep things interesting.  Though you're replaying mostly on the same map, different areas open up keeping navigating through the city beyond a preamble.  Unlike in RL you cant rely on your sat-nav to make your way to various missions points.  The campaign varies with enough objectives to avoid being boring and onces that finished you can replay it or play; Race & Suvivor mode for a variety of challenges.The real neat thing is that you can choose one of many cars you have to unlock by completing the missions.  Each of which can have further upgrades and better equipment and weapons puchased too by collecting money drops or killing zombies.All-inall this is a real cheap game that punches well above its level and never ceases to be enjoyable.  A nice gem of a game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There are a few different game modes: story, races, etc. each of them are quite good but you will find yourself playing a few hours and getting fed up.			",149,17,3,22,4,1,20

												This game is a blast for the most part. Just zombie smashing fun.Really nice graphics, atmosphere, environments and awesome zombie physics. Cool other physics too. The main game mode is great. The story is amusing.The only part I absolutely hated with a passion was the blood race tournaments, and no event worse than the race mode.Every freaking corner or turn just becomes a friggin mess. The cars don't have the handling to take the insane turns and cornering and you just end up spinning out or getting stuck in some random obstacle. Gotta hand it to them, they didn't ease up one bit. They really put the chaos into those races. I only put up with that madness for the achievements. I got all the steam achievements for this game, phew...The elimination mode of the blood race isn't as bad, but is still a pain. The endurance mode just has a trick to it. The real fun though is the slaughter mode. Just endless waves of zombies. After a while it becomes so dense it's like driving through Times Square on New Year's Eve.			",158,32,2,11,7,0,51

												Great game, lot's of stuff to do. The missions are varied and nice to complete. The are a lot of achievements which are quite easy to achieve, but it takes some time. This will keep you busy for a couple of hours. The arena mode and race mode are a lot of fun to play as well.I only have one problem: If I run this game on my laptop, which easily meet the recomended specs, and there are to many zombies the game lags as hell(~5-10fps). This occurs after wave 17 in slaughtermode and in the final missions where are lots of zombies. On my desktop I don't have this issue.Apart from the lag this is a great game!

Product received for free
												I've won this game on steamgifts platform.In the past there was a game Death Really, also there ware first parts of Grand Thief Auto game. If you take those two and add zombies to it you'll get this game but at better graphic. You'll get a campaign, a racing championship with different modes and slaughter mode (you vs waves of zombies). The game is enjoyable experience with nicely set difficulty. On campaign one can go after money but there is a danger one will either go out of time or be destroyed. The vehicles differ not only by basic stats and capacity but the physic is quite different as well. The only week spot I see is the story itself, also I prefer good endings. This is marginal, as such games don't require complex story. The content is quite large and the game is worth it's price, even better I saw that game in bundles so it is obtainable for even far less.			",115,18,14,27,10,0,23

												The camera is a bit dizzying at times and the controls take some getting used to, but the graphics are great and the arcade gameplay is bang on. It took me two years to figure out that since the game requires you to manually select your video card model from a drop down list in order to wok, upgrading or changing your card after you've installed the game will cause it to break. I manually selected my actual graphics card, and voila, after two years the game finally works. Nobody got back to me and the forums came up dry on this issue. Gave it a bad review at the time because of this.			",80,10,0,9,11,0,11

												You will never find a game like this where the designers had to cheat to make it work. No matter how shallow an angle you will stick to the object you hit. You take seconds to get moving from a stop where the other cars go right to full speed. Any oversteer puts you right into the opposite wall. There are times you are looking at the screen wondering how the hell you ended up the way you did. No matter what you buy you will never have an advantage. Save the money and save the stress.

												I received this game as a gift from someone, and I probably would've bought it myself if I knew how much fun it was going to be. I only have about two hours put in to it, but that's certanily enough time to figure out what this game is all about. Picture a mashup of the early Grand Theft Auto titles and your run of the mill zombie destruction game. That really sums it up, but being able to upgrade your car and play around with different weapons is interesting. You will find yourself rolling around, running things over, and picking up health a good bit (or maybe I'm just bad at the game and tend to play recklessly.) It's not something I can see myself sticking with through endgame, but it IS a fun time waster for those who are looking for something to fill the slot while they decide which next big AAA title they want to go after. I'm a big fan of indie games for this reason, they usually have a simple purpose, are easy to play, and offer enough challenges to stay interesting. We're at a point now that they can no longer espouse graphical beauty as an aid to actual gameplay or ""fun factor"" - graphics just don't make a game more fun. A game can be beautiful to an extreme degree and still be boring. This, however, is not boring. It's fast paced, interesting, and an oddity in the world of indie games in that it stands out by being a unique combination of largely overdone concepts. Easily a 9/10, and definitely playable and enjoyable in small doses. You aren't, however, likely to pour 80 hours of your life in to it.			",99,26,5,11,3,0,5

												As I write this review I'm on the verge of vomiting. Not because I'm being over dramatic, but because I'm literally nauseous from playing this game. I thought it was just me until a read another reviewer suffering the same symptoms. The graphics, theme, and content of the game are fine. But it's the gameplay that made me sick which consists of you driving endlessly round, and round, and round... Oh gosh I'm making myself sicker just thinking about it.Perhaps if the maps were bigger and had a better layout, I would have no complaints. But because of my negative experience I say stay away from this game if you get car sick easily. It's too bad because I was looking forward to this game. At least I only paid something like $2.By the way I just took a pill for motion sickness and I hope it kicks in real soon.			",71,99,1,14,25,1,26

												I don't like zombie games. It's overhyped, It's in every corner of the consumable media industry, and it's the same survival story every. single. time!You know what? Zombie driver is the same! but i like it. There's racing and stuff too if you don't wanna do the story mode.Cons:- One weapon loadout at a time. ( Seriously, you make us rampage on all those zombies and then you hold us back on raising hell with multi-weapon loadout? )- Useless bonus vehicles that you'll never really use. ( You might only use 3 vehicles for the story mode )- Can't carry your upgrades from story mode to other modes.Pros:- Unli Nitro ( not that you'll really use it that much )- Good arcady gameplay stress reliever.- Gameplay like GTA 1 or 2, but with zombies.- Various Racing mode.... with weapons!- You know a games soundtrack is good when you're not annoyed by it, so on that note, soundtrack is Okay.Overall: 4/5			",323,81,29,67,27,3,83

 One of the better zombie games in the store! What sets Zombie Driver HD apart from many zombie titles and makes it interesting is that its excellent concept. Exor Studios took what made GTA 2 so much fun and put a zombie spin to it. You go on missions that require you to either rescue survivors, destroying zombie hives, or securing zones to build new bases of operation. You unlock new cars, weapons and upgrades by completing missions in story mode. There is also a survival mode and a racing mode for those who just want to skip the narrative and get in the action. Easy to pick up It's an entertaining game because it gives  enough content to last you for hours and you quickly get the hang of the controls so you will be mowing down zombies like a pro in no time.   You also drive a tank! How cool is that? The best part about Zombie Driver HD is that it knows what it wants to be and thus doesn't take itself serious			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was a bit sceptical of this game from looking at the screen shots.  I decided to download the demo and ended up buying it ^-^  This is a really good game.  The top view perspective is reminiscent of the old GTA titles (with much better graphics of course)  This game is a lot of fun.  A nice selection of game modes, vehicles and upgrades.  The monolouge and missions are good.  Definately worth the purchase price and it also has a high replay value.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Not to mention it likes to grab the camera away from you to see the objective like you are some dummy.  Oh and you can't pause to look at the map anymore, which is by far the most annoying thing.

												If you are prone to be dizzy adjust the camera settings or barf will fly.The game is in many ways superior to the original: better graphics, better gameplay (finally gamepad compatible!), better soundtrack and the best bad voice acting.Seriously, this game is an homage to old B type movies of zombies, are you so surprised the voice acting is so bad? I believe the devs did it on purpose! So bad it's funny and adds to the game.The bosses are kinda cool, the race and survival modes didn't change much.The new vehicles for special missions are amazing and I wish they were available in a separate mode (specially the tank and the fire engine).Overal 8/10 would squash zombies again			",339,48,7,26,16,2,26

												Zombie Driver HD is a vehicle combat game that places you in a post-zombie apocalyptic city where itâs just you, the road and a bloody mess of zombie bodies. Outfit your car with machine guns, flame throwers and missile launchers and match the style of fun and gameplay with the likes of Twisted Metal and Death Race for the NES. Getting tired of killing zombies with a gun? How about using a car? It is as much fun as it sounds and a nice addition to a genre that doesnât get as much love as it once did.http://iamericm.com/2014/03/zombie-driver-hd-indie-game-review/ ",261,72,2,17,9,1,11

												A real joy to play.  Those of you who have played GTA2 & Nation Red can imagine that the gameplay is a mix between those two games.  Not quite a brainless top/down shooter, this game needs you to use just enough brainpower to keep things interesting.  Though you're replaying mostly on the same map, different areas open up keeping navigating through the city beyond a preamble.  Unlike in RL you cant rely on your sat-nav to make your way to various missions points.  The campaign varies with enough objectives to avoid being boring and onces that finished you can replay it or play; Race & Suvivor mode for a variety of challenges.The real neat thing is that you can choose one of many cars you have to unlock by completing the missions.  Each of which can have further upgrades and better equipment and weapons puchased too by collecting money drops or killing zombies.All-inall this is a real cheap game that punches well above its level and never ceases to be enjoyable.  A nice gem of a game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Zombies flood the streets and the city's last hope is apparently someone in a taxi cab.. It's stupidly fun and there's blood splatter everywhere, especially when you mow down hoards of zombies with your vehicle. The view is an overhead topdown kind of view so the camera can be a bit awkward sometimes if you back up too close to a building. The voice acting in this game is also hilariously bad but considering this game doesn't seem to take itself too seriously I'll let that slide. If you like the idea of clearing the streets with a flamethrower equipped limo then this is your game!			",229,33,13,13,8,3,18

												Need something for stress releas? This is the game. Super easy, super fun, super cheesy story, super addictive. I realy like the way it puts you in world and gives you huge amount of zombies to kill. It gives you an awesome feeling of driving over hords of zombies. It is easy to play but it also feels like it should. Different types of vehicles drive different and you can upgrade them. A few different types of weapons.Also the missions doesn't feel too alike. There are few bosses that are fun to destroy. Beside campaign there is race mode where you race around the city and an arena mode where you defend from wave after wave of zombies.7/10			",27,0,0,0,3,0,0

												Surprisingly very amusing game. I bought it with a discount coupon I got from making badges. I didn't expect much of it but when I started playing it gets very fun. Who doesn't want to drive over some zombies? The missions are quite fun to do. You've to think about which car you're using. For example a limosine that can save 6 people or a race car that can save 3 people. If you use to limosine you can do the mission in one run and with the race car you have to get the 3 people, go back to base and get the other 3 (Sometimes you don't get that much time to do that). Car and weapon upgrades are simple and easily achieved but still amusing to strife for. All in all good game for a very cheap price.			",92,24,1,17,3,0,12

												ZDHD didn't agree with me. The gameplay is too shallow to be entertaining, environments to crowded to enjoy the top-down driving aspects. Controls didn't work too well for me, either.All in all: Stay away.			",176,45,4,25,15,1,36

												This game was fun. I finished the story mod in 8 hours, so it could be longer. But there are other mods to try. Missions are very similar, drive to escort someone or kill something. But the cool HD graphic and the satisfying feeling when you drive through the big horde is awesome!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												story mode: about 8 hours, a 30-mission-long action-packed story that drives you around a city. a bit repetitive thoblood race: gives you the pssibility to challenge other racers on the road... but with guns xDslaughter mode: just survive. Take the l4d van and kill kill kill.15hours and 90/103 achievs, good ratio that reveals a not-that-hard game. A good point for that game that brings you back to your childhood.results: ++ game			",169,12,11,7,11,1,30

												A lot of surprising fun. Extremely satisfying to destroy loads of zombies by running over them, shooting them, burning them, blowing them up or doing two or three of those things at the same time. Graphics are great for what it is and there is a bit of nostalgia too, the top down car driving reminds me of Grand Theft Auto 2, the first GTA game I played (lol, I was upset when GTA 3 went to a three dimensial look when it first came out and I was much younger. I thought it would ""ruin"" the franchise because I loved GTA2 so much. But then I killed a hooker with a baseball bat and everything was OK, but I digress.)I don't know if it has multiplayer and dont care as I am one of the 1% who lives in the boonies and can't play games online, but the single player is more than worth it, especially at the sale price of 2 bucks which I got it at. I'm not sure how long it is, im still working through it, but if its currently not on sale there are probably features you'll want to research to decide whether or not to spend 10 bucks on it (I think thats the non sale price).Storyline is predictable but your not playing it for the story, your playing it to destroy zombies via motor vehicle. Have played it long enough to play the mission were you get to drive the tank and I must say it is extremely satisfying.This is a good game, especially if you can get it for the sale price of 2.00 bucks or somewhere around there. Even if your not a fan of the zombie genre I would still recommend it. Who knows, maybe you will find you are a fan of the ""running over things and destroying them with fire as well"" genre.Simply: Good game, if you think you'd like it I can almost guarantee you would. I'd recommend more research if multiplayer is a must for you as I know it is for many gamers. Even if thats the case though, the single player is more than satisifying enough. I've used the word satisfying an awful lot in this review which I guess would speak to how much I enjoy the game and murdering zombies. GET THE GAME.			",330,91,4,33,34,3,66

												You will never find a game like this where the designers had to cheat to make it work. No matter how shallow an angle you will stick to the object you hit. You take seconds to get moving from a stop where the other cars go right to full speed. Any oversteer puts you right into the opposite wall. There are times you are looking at the screen wondering how the hell you ended up the way you did. No matter what you buy you will never have an advantage. Save the money and save the stress.

												Zombie Driver HD is a vehicle combat game that places you in a post-zombie apocalyptic city where itâs just you, the road and a bloody mess of zombie bodies. Outfit your car with machine guns, flame throwers and missile launchers and match the style of fun and gameplay with the likes of Twisted Metal and Death Race for the NES. Getting tired of killing zombies with a gun? How about using a car? It is as much fun as it sounds and a nice addition to a genre that doesnât get as much love as it once did.http://iamericm.com/2014/03/zombie-driver-hd-indie-game-review/ ",261,72,2,17,9,1,11

												I received this game as a gift from someone, and I probably would've bought it myself if I knew how much fun it was going to be. I only have about two hours put in to it, but that's certanily enough time to figure out what this game is all about. Picture a mashup of the early Grand Theft Auto titles and your run of the mill zombie destruction game. That really sums it up, but being able to upgrade your car and play around with different weapons is interesting. You will find yourself rolling around, running things over, and picking up health a good bit (or maybe I'm just bad at the game and tend to play recklessly.) It's not something I can see myself sticking with through endgame, but it IS a fun time waster for those who are looking for something to fill the slot while they decide which next big AAA title they want to go after. I'm a big fan of indie games for this reason, they usually have a simple purpose, are easy to play, and offer enough challenges to stay interesting. We're at a point now that they can no longer espouse graphical beauty as an aid to actual gameplay or ""fun factor"" - graphics just don't make a game more fun. A game can be beautiful to an extreme degree and still be boring. This, however, is not boring. It's fast paced, interesting, and an oddity in the world of indie games in that it stands out by being a unique combination of largely overdone concepts. Easily a 9/10, and definitely playable and enjoyable in small doses. You aren't, however, likely to pour 80 hours of your life in to it.			",99,26,5,11,3,0,5
