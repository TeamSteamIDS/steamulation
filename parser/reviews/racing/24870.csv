												A good balance between a racing sim and arcade. Need for Speed Shift is all about racing on a racetrack, and fighting through the pack to place in the Top 3. There is also drift mode, where you score the most combined points in three rounds to win. The driving physics are decent, not too bad, but not great either. There are a good selection of cars that you can own (although it sucks that you can only buy 1 unit of each car) and a range of real world tracks (Nurburgring, Spa, Silverstone, etc.). Those make a pretty good legal racing game.The annoying thing is cheap AI in car battle mode, especially in Autopolis GP. They can just tackle a tight hairpin (turn 4) at 100+ km/h without understeering... Also, there are some unfair car battle matchups, when 1 car is a lot faster than the other (Audi R8 vs Aston Martin V8 Vantage for example) and no matter how good your driving is, you'll still lose in the slower car (unless you play dirty). Overall, it is still a good racing game to play if you are looking for a mixture of simulation and arcadey style of racing.			",12,0,11,2,2,0,1

												I bought this, on sale, as i enjoy racing games though i didnt have any on PC. I Chose this one for a number of reasons. First of all, i used to play some sort of Need For Speed on PlayStation 2 and it was my favorite game. I also bought it for the system requirements. It runs flawlessly on my laptop (A10, 8GB) and im yet to test it on my media PC (A4, 4GB). The game is fun; it makes you want to keep on playing. It's just one of them games you could play for hours. The graphics are great especially for a game this age. Of corse it's not the most recent Forsa but in my oppinion the graphics are perfectly fine. There is plenty to do in the story mode, i have yet to try multi-player. One minor complaint: the controles on keyboard and mouse are just not that good. This is the case for ALL racing games, not just this one. I would reccomend picking up a controller if you dont already have one, it makes a huge difference!			",21,2,2,2,2,0,0

												This isn't really necessarily a review, but more of a comment between Shift 1 and Shift 2.I honestly prefer this other than Shift 2 probably because they don't try so hard to be a racing simulator. This game is a mixture of a racing arcade/simulator. Shift 2's racing and flow was just not up to par with this. The racing in this game it actually FEELS really good. The cars look beautiful. The cockpit even more beautiful. If you're not satisfied with a car or part you've just bought you can just SELL it and get every single cent you've put in that car. UNLIKE Shift 2. Oh yeah, that reminds me too, money in this game isn't hard to get. You can get a nice amount each race if you know what you're doing. They even give you cash for custom/free races that you setup yourself. And the fact that you can get a 100% refund for your fully customized car feels good. I don't have to worry about wasting my time putting blood and sweat into a car that I probably can't use 60% of the time due to tiers and specialized events. The engines, transmission, skidding etc all sound amazing in this game.   The customization is pretty in-depth giving you the option to go up a tier if you have all of your tiers vehicle enhancements. Which is AMAZING because you get to bring your favorite vehicle to more races. What saddens me is that the game doesn't have any night races or courses. Well, at least from what I've seen. This game also encourages ramming and playing clean. You get points which gives you bonus money and experience for playing either aggressive or clean. Yeah, pretty ♥♥♥♥ing ironic mainly because in Shift 2 they try to act like the game also encourages ramming with their spectacular Shift 2 announcement trailer. (No really. I really loved Shift 2's trailer. It was amazing.) But really you couldn't do none of that ramming♥♥♥♥♥♥in Shift 2 without crashing your♥♥♥♥♥into a guard rail. I'm not a Shift 2 hater at all. I actually do like it and think Slightly Mad Studios did a good job with it. Especially with the head-cam which I wish this game had, but it's just that this game is better in many other aspects and ways than Shift 2. I also like the in-game trailers showing off each type of race event in this game. The music in this game is good♥♥♥♥♥♥too.   The AI in this game aren't really that hard to handle. I haven't really tried max difficulty to know though. Also the replay camera in this game is INCREDIBLE. It really gets you into the spot when you see yourself in a TV like position racing across the screen. I think this game has the best replay camera for any racing game I've seen.....Well, maybe not better than Assetto Corsa's replay camera. I think it's because the sense of speed on camera is set perfectly to make you feel like you're actually watching someone race. But yeah, overall. The game is totally worth it. You won't regret it. Also, don't think I was talking down Shift 2. I just think this game is just superior to its sequel in many ways.			",297,54,16,33,45,5,33

												I've spent most of my time with this game outside of Steam, and it's quite possibly my favorite racing game of all time. Up there with Most Wanted and GT3. Quite an unique mix of arcade and simulation, meaning the driving is precise and requires skill and thinking, but at the same time it's also very dramatic in both how it feels and it's presentation.What I hate though is the inability to make whichever car you want competitive. I finished Most Wanted with the Punto I bought at the start, and fully upgraded it was just as fast as the most expensive cars in the game. Which is not realistic, let's face it, but games don't have to be. Shift doesn't have that, not by a long shot, and towards the end of the game you'll have to switch to more expensive cars, on top of which you'll have to ignore all cars that for whatever reason can't be WORKS-converted. All cars below tier 4 that don't have WORKS available become obsolete very fast, which is stupid. I'd love to finish the game with one of my favorite cars, but they just can't keep up.Still though, a great racing game. Fun, thrilling and well worth what little it costs these days.

												Some say this game is not NFS because theres no cops or streets. What i say is dont you feel tired of driving cars with  unrealistic handling with unrealistic scenario every year?  This game was the new attempt of EA and for me as a child then, was my first time sensing the tracks (like Spa and Leguna Seca) and rules in real life.  Although the handling is still not real, it creates a link between casual game and racing simulator. It is the first game I have played with detailed interior. When cars are in high speed, the interior become blur; when you crash, the entire screen become not only blur but also black and white. When driving in damping road, and you are in first person, the camera is shaking as well. All these details, comes from a game in 2009, 7 years ago. Ive played alot of racing games (Assetto Corsa, Dirt Rally, Forza) many car games doesn't have those features today. And this game for me, full of memory. At that time I wish I could have a computer runing the highest settings with 30fps or higher lol. And now it seems not a big deal. For me, this game is 10/10!			",39,3,12,1,6,0,1

												For a 2009 title Shift holds up incredibly well. It both runs and looks fantastic on Windows 10. It offers up quite a lot of gameplay for the price, with a nice array of cars and tracks, all constructed to the highest level of detail possible at the time. Gameplay is fun and fast-paced, but don't believe the marketing. It is an arcade racer through and through, not a sim. Career mode progression also relies on an inferior and clunky arcade style unlock system, where you are forced to earn stars to unlock future events with some fairly ridiculous side objectives (spin-out 4 opponents) forced upon the player. Overall Shift is a really solid arcade racer, if you accept it as such, you'll have a good time, but if you expect this to be a sim, you will be sorely disappointed.Here is my full in-depth review

(i don't like look of racecars, its not my taste) As example my r34 had 450 km/h (srsly?) and if i put the drivetrain to acceleration, car is so uncontrolable. (i am suck at tuning too xD) i didn't bought every part and only focused on quick play and online battles, and i do it well with a 320 hp skyline.

												Need For Speed is one of my favorite Need For Speeds. It has the customization that we all love. You may be able to only use body kits of 2 or 3, but the custom vinyls make up for it. You can buy custom performance packages for your car, and rims you probably have never even heard of! The tuning is amazing. You can turn your 425 HP 1969 Dodge Charger R/T into a 625 HP Charger that can drift with traction control on without the drift gamemode on. It has multiple controllers that this game supports. Everything from Logitech Wheels from a few years ago, to wheels from over 10 years ago. The graphics are amazing for the game, even though it was made in 2008 or 9. The sounds for the cars are not that bad for the year this game was made too ! Its not as bad as need for speed hot pursuit. I guess you can say this is the best need for speed that was made before criterion came in and decided to screw up everything with need for speed. Buy this game, and you wont regret it.

												Best in-car camera I've ever seen in a racing game. A wide FoV, camera appropriately reacts to inertial forces. You can really feel the weight of the car shift around and better predict corners. The 'black and white blurry' and 'shaky cam' effects also prove to be less of a gimmick and more of an added layer of gameplay depth, really punishing you for being too rough with the car by taking away your ability to see clearly as you're trying to recover from collisions.Handling model is okay until you try to tweak anything, at which point handling turns to mud; you either have to keep default settings or be prepared to spend a lot of time trying to find a very specific, different combination of car tuning settings that works. It kind of feels as if the assists silently turn themselves back on when you try to tune. They could have done more to differentiate the feel of different cars, too. Still, if you're prepared to ♥♥♥♥ around long enough, you can turn your AWD Lambo in to a hovercraft that spends 90% of every race sideways and still wins.Track selection is also decent, if a little padded and the soundtrack is inoffensive enough.

												There are only 2 NFS titles through the long history of this franchise that made it for me. First one was Porsche 2000, and the second is this game. The thing is… I honestly don't know how to explain why. Maybe the best way would be to do it by listing some contradictions to other? Both titles *are not* cartoonish. Both give you a sense of being a real owner of the cars you drive — there is no stupid scripted story throughout the game (let's leave that to other genres, shall we…). Both have cars that are pure pleasure to drive, even with a keyboard which I always do exclusively (sorry). I won't recommend you coming back to Porsche 2000. Sixteen years and counting, let's leave it as a legend and let it rest. SHIFT1 is, however, definitely still worth a first or another go. 7/10			",36,2,5,2,2,0,3

												I finished the game today (all the races) and I have to say I have mostly positive feelings about this game. It's a big step up from NFS ProStreet (which was the game that started this NFS racing sim business).The driving feels good compared to ProStreet and frankly speaking, all of the other games in the NFS series. It feels fun and kinda realistic which makes it challenging somewhat but it doesn't ruin the experience (if you tweak the settings enough to your liking). It's not on par with games like Forza but I'd say as far as NFS games go, this is by far one of the best ones (keep in mind that I am mostly judging it from a gameplay\driving physics perspective).What I didn't like was that the game kinda got repetitive after a while, especially given that you had access to every car and upgrade very early in the game, and had stupid amounts of money as long as you completed all the races. Still, it's not a very long game so it isn't that annoying.The soundtrack was good for the most part. It felt like it had too few songs and it kinda got repetitive after a while. Maybe there just weren't that many songs that I enjoyed.Performance wise, this game runs at a solid 60 FPS in 1080p (and probably all the way up to 4K) at max settings on my i5 4460 and GTX 980 Ti rig, on Windows 10. There aren't any game breaking bugs that I am aware of. There are some frame rate issues though. Any sort of crash (even hitting small objects) will result in a couple or more skipped frames and this includes crashes done by the AI, at the far end of the track, potentially miles away from you. This is some sort of glitch I think that can affect gameplay to some extent but most of the time the game delivers the frames on time (unlike other games in the series I could mention *cough all the NFS games from Most Wanted to Undercover).

												Shift is in my opinion the best racing simulation on the market. The original still looks good, and holds up well as an addition to Shift 2. I actually think I prefer Shift 1 to 2, but if you've played one you know the other. Both have very similar physics engines and feels. I love the integration of corner mastering too. The works upgrades make your favorite Tier 1 & 2 cars into powerhouses which lets you compete even an RX-8 well into the game - it's a well-balanced idea. Drift mode initially struck me as virtually impossible, but returning to the game a second time, it's actually quite a lot of fun (I recommend a Works'd RX-7 or, of course, the AE86). The game, in my opinion, has a greater depth than Forza, for example, and I'd even recommend Shift highly to someone with a 360/PS3.			",160,50,11,10,12,1,21

												this is a pretty good game. the graphics are impressive and the game runs amazingly smooth even with my slower PC. the game also seems to be very responsive with the key board (which i have to resort to sence my steering set up is curently not functional at the moment.). the game has a fairly unique system for the Ai (at least at the time) and the enviroments, sounds, and so on really throw you into the racing expirience. the game does have a bit of issues like all the cars look like they are on ice in the 3rd peson view or chase cam and the Ai in the later teirs will end up hiting your car quite a bit. this game hasn't aged in the graphics or anything for that matter. this is just an amazingly uniqe game and i recomend you at least give it a go.

												Well I finally bought it and I have to say that this game is soon to be almost 10 years old, and the graphics are damn fine. With fully working cockpits and preety good physics engine, the game does make you grind to get money but its well worth it. this is a Classic. Good job Slightly Mad, cant belive this was made in 2009 .  Great driving game. A+			",8,1,6,0,1,0,1

												This game is great. The car handling, the visuals, the difficulty are spectacular. The opponents are not nearly as retаrded as they tend to be in most racing games and actually provide a challenge. However, it has one major flaw. The NFS World tour (final tour) is unlocked midway through the game. With only 8 hours on the game I beat the tour, with half the events were still not done. But after the final tour is beat the temptation to grind the rest of the races is just not there. So I only got 9 hours out of this game. Still, it was very enjoyable. The unlocking system is flaud, but only a minor issue. If you're gonna get it - play all events first :)			",92,6,18,2,3,1,3

												If you like having a huge dead spot in your steering, that you can't get rid of, this game is for you. Personally, I like a nice tight wheel. Like all of the rest of this series, this one is also next to impossible to control. Especially with a force feedback wheel. The only one in the series, that was half way decent, was the original. Every one since has had a lacklustre handling profile that takes any actual fun that might be had, and makes it a chore just to keep your vehicle going straight, or turning into corners, when you turn your wheel. My suggestion is to save your money and buy something that IS NOT produced by EA Games. Remembering how responsive the original NFS was, this is a huge disappointment.			",3,0,7,0,23,0,15

 Important Normally I never do a review with just some few hours of gameplay. But I guess after seeing so many reviews with problems after starting the game, or similar. This migh help a bit. FIXING: PhysX This game is known for some issues related to performance, and problems with some hardware, or underperformance on some actual GPUs. The most important thing is that Steam is not installing the PhysX Software the game uses to calc crashes and random stuff. This is exactly why people is not progressing after the first or second video prior the first race. Or even starting the game.Get the PhysX Software from  Here [www.nvidia.com] Review This part is easy. This is not Gran Turismo, or Forza Motorsport. This is a mix between some sim racing and some arcade moves. Is a fun game, and Steam is still supporting Online. The gameplay works nicely with gamepad (To anyone having problems using the 360 Controller, use the 360 Buttons Mod inside No Grip Racing).Some bad things about the game can be the AI, that can do some freaky stuff like crashing on you without any reason, but using Hardest Settings brings a better response inside the track. Still some good features on this game can be:   Cockpit view  Still good graphics or at least not so ugly  Funny to race and enjoyable Final Thoughts IF you're looking for a better sim game. Get Assetto Corsa or Project Cars, those are way better on that aspect. But this game is good, and works with lot less resources so you can have fun while travelling, or using an old system, or Laptop environments.Have Fun!			",115,9,5,12,5,1,5

												Summary.A bad balance between realism and arcade.The Good.Great graphics.Fun for the first few hours.The Bad.Menu with a controller is extremely clunky.Because, unlike other NFS games, SHIFT doesn't bother to change menu buttons, like ""7"", for ""X"". It thinks you want to navigate the menus with your keyboard and mouse, instead of the obviously hooked up XB1 controller, because I'm driving with that.Controls are just♥♥♥♥♥♥Unlike most other 'realistic' racing games, SHIFT thinks that you want to go into full lock when you're at top speed, instead of progressively lowering sensitivity the faster your speed is. No, what this game does, is force you into a dumb as ♥♥♥♥ slide, as your TCS activates, because apparently it thinks you want to... you know what, I don't even know what the game thinks you're attempting to do, because that ♥♥♥♥ing TCS goes on constantly, because your car is constantly out of control at the slightest steering input. It's probably easier if you have a steering wheel, but there's no reason for the controls to be this bad on what a majority of users would be using, which is a XB or PS controller.Physics are questionable.Rear ending cars with another car, in real life, doesn't cause them to get shot 20ft into the air. Flipping, sure, but even that isn't simulated right in this game. Cars flip, because some part of it digs into dirt/grass, or they are really sideways when their tire suddenly gains a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of grip. In this game, it's like the cars become cardboard boxes once none of their tires are touching the ground, as in they have no mass, so they just get launched 20 ♥♥♥♥ing ft into the air when you bump them right and it's ♥♥♥♥ing dumb.And then there's the handling between these♥♥♥♥♥♥controls and questionable physics. Apparently, when you go into a banked corner at 'just the right speed' your car bottoms out, as evidenced by the long trail of sparks underneath the car, which causes your car to go out of control and not accept any sort of steering input. I don't know what ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥suspension these cars use, but you can't adjust that at all in the game. I have never seen any racing cars just absolutely bottom out through the entire corner, unless it had no wheels. In fact, this is the first game I have ever played that does this. It's not like the cars doing this are F1 or other low ride height cars either, they're just tuned tier 1/2/3 cars, which should never have this problem, ever.Game Modes♥♥♥♥ this ♥♥♥♥ing DRIFTOOOOOOOO♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's so ♥♥♥♥ing dumb, because the controls and CAMERA switch, randomly, between 'oh, you want to corner' and 'DRIFTOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO'. As if the car wasn't hard enough to control already, there's a whole new dimension added with drifting events. Instead of a linear transition, or you know, a complete physics/control system, this game has a very strange camera and control transition between the start of your drift and what it considers a 'drift', which makes it unnecissarily difficult to do these events. In fact, it felt so clunky and stupid, that I totally lost interest doing any of them.CameraOH MY GOD, I can't complain enough about this. Okay, I get that crashing hard will disorientate you, I've had that happen in real life, but this game goes overboard with it. Tapping another car or kissing the wall does not do that in real life, yet this game does. It was fine at first, but gets extremely annoying after the 10th race with ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI drivers that decided to randomly ram you or brake check you. and like ♥♥♥♥ I am going to hit the brakes for♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥AI getting in my way.Oh, hey, do you like simulated frame drops? This game does that when you hit things. At first, I thought it was my PC, but turns out, that's a feature effect this game has.And if you want to point out that I can just drive smoothly, I do when I can, but the ♥♥♥♥ing controls and handling become♥♥♥♥♥♥on some courses, that I can't be bothered to drive smoothly around the AI.MapLOL. A map that tells you if you've 'mastered' a corner or not, it's nothing more than a distraction. Mastering a corner doesn't mean♥♥♥♥♥♥ you just have to finish in first place, because there is no smooth cornering in this game, just the disappointing sight of smoke coming from all 4 tires, because the game thinks you want full lock instead of minor inputs.Progressing through the gameDon't like to do some events you don't consider to be fun? well, too bad. Unless you do those, you're not going to be able to progress through the game. And that's where I said '♥♥♥♥ this game' and went ahead and uninstalled it.I don't care about drifting events in this game, it's done terribly and I want no part of it.Racing is fun, until you get the go-kart map with nearly zero opportunity to overtake.Time trials, didn't even bother with those, I want to race against other cars, not the clock, especially when the controls and handling are so clunky.Endurance. LOL, a ♥♥♥♥ing '8' shaped course for endurance? that was the most hilarious♥♥♥♥♥♥I've seen.Battles. Just choose the OP car, there's no point in using the♥♥♥♥♥♥one, because it's going to lose 100% of the time.Concluding remarksNFS:♥♥♥♥♥			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I honestly can't recommend this game. In the beginning I was enjoying it but the time exposes the weak gameplay and campaign. Starting with the principal, I didn't like the gameplay, cars behave strangely and even by customizing options of difficulty and assistance I couldn't find a better way to get used to the drive mechanics and physics. The campaign started promising but became frustrating, there are a few extra goals that are impossible or don't make sense, and thus those who like to leave the game complete is frustrating, win races isn't enough, by the time I gave up and I just collect the stars needed to get to the last level and beat the game.I positively highlight the licenses, there is a wide variety of vehicles and good circuits, although because of the gameplay and frustration with the campaign I could not fully enjoy this aspect.I also emphasize that it's impossible to play on the keyboard, joystick or steering wheel is highly required.6/10			",237,47,12,43,21,2,57

												Honestly this game is a hybrid between NFS undercover because of all the custimisation. And project cars because its also a serious sim with great handling and graphics. Its also extremily optimised well. i mean i have a 7 year old toshiba satelite laptop with windows 10 32 bit. And it runs almost a constant 30fps on medium-high graphics. and when it does dip it usually goes to about 28-27fps. And even on medium high graphics it still looks alot better then the console versions. Honestly this game looks better or as good as project cars on xbox one at about medium graphic settings. P.S i recomend you turning the motion blur to low and have the resolution on about 32 with no AA. and then have the antialising to 4x and the car detail to high.Thats only if you have a simular pc to me. P.P.S this is basicily NFS undercover but as a serious sim and with great handling. Also you are much better off getting this game in the EA Racing bundle or on sale.			",22,3,11,3,4,0,1

												Boots - check!  Gloves - check!  Helmet - check!Turn the key, shift to 1st gear, rev the engine and let the clutch rise coz its racing time.For me, this is amongst the funest NFS games out there. I think the last one I had so much fun with was Underground 2. NFS Shift has an interesting balance between arcade and simulation. This leads to an interesting control experience that you either love or hate from what I have heard. For me, keyboard didn’t work for this game, but pad did and after some practice I really started to enjoy it. Awesome thing is, this game feels amazingly tense. You are always on the edge of your seat. It’s easy to get into, hard to master but most of all, with some of the faster cars, it’s just blazing fast.Lucky, you are being rewarded every step of the way so getting better feels pretty good. Also the graphics are pretty sweet and the whole feel is pretty immersive.Thumbs up from me!8/10			",536,158,36,44,48,7,108

												Amazing game, but it needs more New cars or atleast a DLC Graphics are amazing for that year game, controls arent the best ones,  especialy when you try to drift, game is more about slick circuit racing, very Hard to sqeeze any fun out of it. When u reach tier 4 game starts to get boring, I upgraded my cars, did a tune for them būt they still cant drift, cmon. But I still recommend this game to all petrolheads out there.

Then look no further.This is the second simulation racing game in the Need for Speed series, the first one is ProStreet, it was kind of meh, it was a  fine game with flaws.This one is way better, it's not RFactor, Assetto Corsa or at any great racing simulation's level but it's good anyway.If you're looking for a challenging simulation game, look away, this is not for you.If you're looking for a game that can be modded so you can have more cars and more of everything, forget about this one, it's not for you.If you're just looking for a relaxing simulation game that is actually pretty easy, then this is for you.Also, playing this game with a keyboard is way more easy than playing games such as RFactor or even Assetto Corsa with a keyboard.8/10			",972,203,71,193,128,3,222

												The biggest thing is that this game is MUCH better than the 2nd game. It is optimized much better (in the 2nd game I couldn't get a solid 60 fps on a GTX 1070), and there are no crashes (at least from my expirience whereas the 2nd game crashed every 1-2 hours or even at complete random at menus and such). To me the car physics are better (using assists isnt a bad thing) and the drifting is okay. The main guy talking is much better to me since I could actually didn't hate listening to him. Just don't buy the 2nd game (at least on PC) and buy this one. The car selection is nice and so is the track selection. The AI can be a little easy even on medium so if you really want a challenge just play on hard or medium.			",37,2,4,10,2,0,3

The tension can feel real. Or, coming round a long bend to suddenly find a car on it's roof, parked on your raceline!Pros: Decent graphics, excellent feel, nice progression sytem, variety of events (races/drift/time & lap eliminators/hot laps), different cars feel different (see cons), those 'racing moments', ideal for someone who's just bought a wheel or someone coming from an arcade racing background who wants to move towards sim racing (also see cons).Cons: Although the cars do feel different, it's more of a difference in speed and reaction time (say a tier 3/4 car vs a tier 1/2) than noticeable difs in handling, the track setting makes it feel more simlike, but in terms of handling it's far more arcadey, damage model seems purely cosmetic even at Full setting, perfect launch doesn't seem to have any effect and completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI (sorry, but there's no other word for an AI who violently lurches into you with no reason, especially after giving you racing room immediately before! It gives the effect of decent AI at times, but they are definately on a pre-programmed path in reality and (insert Deity of choice) help you if you're in their way!!

Or, coming round a long bend to suddenly find a car on it's roof, parked on your raceline!Pros: Decent graphics, excellent feel, nice progression sytem, variety of events (races/drift/time & lap eliminators/hot laps), different cars feel different (see cons), those 'racing moments', ideal for someone who's just bought a wheel or someone coming from an arcade racing background who wants to move towards sim racing (also see cons).Cons: Although the cars do feel different, it's more of a difference in speed and reaction time (say a tier 3/4 car vs a tier 1/2) than noticeable difs in handling, the track setting makes it feel more simlike, but in terms of handling it's far more arcadey, damage model seems purely cosmetic even at Full setting, perfect launch doesn't seem to have any effect and completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI (sorry, but there's no other word for an AI who violently lurches into you with no reason, especially after giving you racing room immediately before! It gives the effect of decent AI at times, but they are definately on a pre-programmed path in reality and (insert Deity of choice) help you if you're in their way!! My advice - don't rush, complete each tier and use the invitational events to try new (better) cars.			",83,19,17,17,4,0,0

												A damn good racing game which is very much like GRID but more in a complex manner and the steering ability can be very difficult to control the vehicle at times. EA/Slighly mad studio have done well with this game, of course it's not perfect , anyway it has a lovely graphics with strong colours, the sound is quite good too,so i think this is a very realistic gaming experience to explore and probably much better than grid or if not better in My Wildest Dreams...lol..i would say it's more comfortable to use the steering wheel instead of gamepad somehow it moves better driving through out the tracks....True, The Shift's graphics engine isn't quite as good as Grid's ECO engine but damn close.

												All of the reviews about this game being 'too hard' or 'un-playable' are most likely from people that don't feel like 'wasting' their time learning the potholes and speed bumps of a somewhat decent game.Don't get me wrong, this game is indeed 'different'. There are a few red flags you need to be aware of. First and foremost being that in a good number of cases, you will not be able to run the game straight from the download/Install. Other times, your hardware will straight be incompatible with it, so do yourself a favor and research if it will work with you stuff, because a recent upgrade in hardware took my ability to play this game away.Secondly, you will never drive an actual, to Specification Track Car… Taking the time to tune it will help, but  the 'end game' cars bounce around and fly on the track is because they are still setup as a road car. Their spring rates, dampening force, and so on is far from what you would want on a track.Thirdly, the true 'End' of the game essentially becomes Trackmania… Driver against Driver with a minimalistic gap between the cars you are driving.Overall, a good game, just do your research before buying it, and expect some headaches along with it.Honestly, my favorite 'sim-cade' racing game there is, with Pro-Street running a very close second. Speaking of which, if you like NFS Pro-Street, you'll like this, IF you can get it to work. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game and Shift 2 Unleashed when they were on sale years ago, and I was eager to see how they look and run on my new 144-hertz gaming monitor. Dirt 3 and Grid 2 run at a silky-smooth 144 fps througout, but I was looking for a more sim-like racer, so I gave the Shift games a shot. I figured they should run great, since they were both released over 5 years ago during the last console generation. However, Shift 2 somehow struggled to maintain a mere 50 fps on my 8-Core, 4.2 ghz processor and GTX 970. A 360/PS3 game. Okay, fine, I figure. Bad optimization. I'll try the first Shift game instead. This game might be great, but I'm not going to play it the way it looks for me. The graphics options can't be changed from the default 60hz, medium-detail, no-AA settings, no matter how many times I save the game or try to edit my config file. You have to restart the game to change graphics settings, and those settings inexplicably reset every time you restart the game. Apparently some other Steam user who had this problem was able to work some kind of witch-doctor scheme to get his graphics settings to keep from resetting every time he launched the game. What he described did not work for me, and my patience is spent.EA, it is not my job to get your awful 5+ year old console ports working and running like they should on my enthusiast-level gaming computer. Say what you will about Microsoft, at least the Forza Motorsport 6 beta looks and runs great on my PC. So Microsoft gets my money in the future instead of you.			",641,187,27,123,56,1,91

												When you turn up the AI ability the only thing it does is make them more able to do things that aren't possible and allow them to take you out and off the track . So I found myself just bashing my way through and getting in the lead and racing by myself over and over again. The game should have an AI that allows the car to drive along side and race you cleanly. These are mostly a waste of time and after racing a forcefeedback steering wheel for 10 laps and then getting rammed off the track ..... over and over again well that gets not to be very fun and if you run it on low ability your out in front by the first turn. Any of these car games where the sole aim of the AI is to knock you off the track in officall races are a waste of time..... I deleted mine Im done putting in alot of time and then just getting wrecked.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The sounds are good, burning rubber, turning, and impacts.This game sadly, just like project cars, has very little music, sometime almost none.Little voice work, it's a racing game.It looks good, its not awkward so you wont see block buildings.The cars look nice, sadly I haven't seen any older ones, They look as if you driving a photograph made into 3D.But the people look like PS2 people, they could use some work, by that I mean a lot of work.This play more like an arcade racing game at times so it is much nicer to play and a good game to ease you self into more realistic racers, I should have played this before Project Cars.I like this a bit more than project Cars. 7/10			",317,110,14,30,17,3,13

												I've never been a fan of racing games in my earlier life, and NfS: Shift is probably the only game that I instantly liked when I first played it.The only true way to ""fully play"" this game is to put all of the difficulty sliders on the simulation dificulty. Only then, you'll find out how rewarding racing a car can be. Especially since it is really difficult to keep it stable at high speeds and in tight turns.The graphics in this game are clean and sharp. Textures could be better, though car detail is ample and greatly refined. Interior cockpit view is also done admirably. The sound feels too fake at times. Especially when you have games like DiRT 2 and 3, that use a sound system that is near indistinguishable from the real thing.A good game, excellent for drinking games and arcade race players. Drive one round, whenever you miss a turn and spin out, you ♥♥♥♥ing chug.			",246,41,9,12,25,2,46

É tenso, mas a sensação de terminar uma corrida bem é sensacional.Por 10 dolares vale muito a pena, enquanto o Shift 2 não abaixa o preço.			",394,88,23,44,40,3,66

												As much as I enjoy racing games, this is pretty bad.First, the good:~Cars are well modeled and look fantastic~Tracks are well builtAaand that's about it.As for the bad:~Physics are not friendly~Cars bounce too much.~Braking feels odd~Camera controls are clunky~Driving controls are poorly laid out and not changableWhat I eman by ""the cars bounce"" is just that. If you ever think about leaving the pavement, the acrs bounce over invisible terrain (Not mapped, just a flat texture) and too much so to be realistic. Most track sides in the real world are groomed just as well as the track itself.Even on pavement, the car would bounce oddly. Turning, it shook. Accelerating, it shook. Braking, it shook.Overall?No, I would not recommend this game.And before you go all like ""But you don't really have any time in the game! You need to play it and get used to it first!""Yeah, no. I've played many, many racing games on several different platforms. This is just...no.			",26,2,2,6,10,1,4

												Let me review this game while it's still fresh in my mind. After 29 hours, I finished the game. Granted - I'm missing about 10 stars out of 1125 or something, but the requirements for those stars are so arbitrary, I'm not even going to bother.Graphics: 4/5Sound: 5/5AI: 2/5Replayability: 2/5Online: 0/5Soundtrack: -20/5This game has its highs and lows. I will say that the interior views for the cars are amazing - NFS: Shift is the only game I've played that featured a cockpit view of the AE86, which not even Polyphony Digital (makers of Gran Turismo) could not do. Aside from the cool interiors, decent HUD effects, and sound, the game is not really all that great.The AI is absolute trash, and WILL ram you on turn one of any track. The thing that disgusted me the most was the gratuitous use of rubberbanding, which only activated once the AI realizes you have a good chance of passing them.The in-race missions are okay, except for the ones that require you to spin out/tap out an opponent. As a racing game veteran, there is nothing that I hate more than dirty racing, and this game requires you to smash opponents for stars in certain races. To add insult to injury, when you DO attempt to smash the enemies, you might as well be crashing your car into a wall, because pit maneuvers and other various tactics do not work, and instead will spin you out.Sometimes, races require you to perform clean laps as a mission. This is extremely do-able on tracks with more than one lap. This is NOT do-able on Nurburgring. Because of Nurb's narrow track, and the AI's awful racing line, you will either be hit, or you will hit someone. If you try to race clean, you will never make it into first. That was another mission I did not bother doing.Online was non-existent. I selected quick match at peak online gaming hours (10pm EST - 2am EST) and did not find a single match. The game still gave me the option to create a match, and I could post my leaderboard stats online, so I arrived at the conclusion that the servers are up, but nobody plays this online.I completed this game because I enjoyed NFS as a kid. If I had to rank it out of games that I've played out of the franchise, I'd rank it NFSU2 > Pro Street > Shift > NFSU1.I picked this game up for $5 because it was on sale, and I think that is the only circumstance that you as the reader should pick this up. This game is NOT worth $20.The soundtrack is ridiculously♥♥♥♥♥♥too. I just played the game with my Eurobeat collection running in the background.			",60,2,5,3,2,0,2

												Overall this is a great racing game. It got a good balance between realism and arcade feeling with lots of customization to fit your own perfect race style.The only issue I had with it personally was the AI. If you are like me and want to play on highest difficulty to get a sense of accomplishment you will just waste your time. The AI is extremely hard and they don't play fair. You basically need to drive 100% perfectly on every track and even that wont be enough when you get rammed on every single corner.So since the sequel have released with improved physics and AI there is no real reason to play this one.

												alright i gonna make it simple:I recommend this game if you love super arcade-ish physics and agressive style racing. ofcourse you also can do clean racing!my review on this game, (warning long!)positives:this game has some nice collection of carsthe graphics from 2009 really feel like it is from 2014the game is extremely well optimized!the physics are pretty easy to handle on keyboard and on a controller, same goes if you have a wheel!rarely funny glitches occur that will not screw your game up (except for multiplayer)ofcourse tuning is available if you upgrade your carmanual shifting is still there in this game :)wide range of controller, graphics and gameplay options!you will get so much money that you can almost everything you want (if you drive well)negatives:this game could crash if you do ALT+TABthe AI IS EXTREMELY UNBALANCED! seriously on easy it is like the cars aren't even there, on medium you will notice the cars that they are driving but yet you will fly past them. and on hard.... hard is so hard you need a wanking warp drive in your car in order to ♥♥♥♥ing overtake the cars AND DON'T TRY TO BE AS FAST AS THE AI IN THE CORNERS holy mother of♥♥♥♥♥♥even after 1 hour and 30 minutes of tuning my pagani Zonda R for cornering and acceleration the AI was able to take corners at bloody 280+ km/h while i am freakin' flying all over the place if i go faster than 215 km/h in the corners, heck even the acceleration of those cars is like they have over 80 billion horsepower or something and their grip levels are so high that you think they have foiking magnets under their tires and still they accelerate 9999999X faster than you.Also the aggression of the AI is so bad on hard.. it doesn't matter if you are a beggar or the focking king of the world they WILL NOT let you overtake them and if you manage to do that they will bombdive you so hard they will sent you flying to planet marsthe driving line though it can be disabled i do not recommend to disable it!there are circuits that if you go even 1mm off the racing line you will start bouncing all over the place without stopping! please DO NOT disable that line for your safety sake! or you will end up being in the crowd like me.the tuning can sometimes be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥since the tuning slide bars do not have enough options which will sent you in the situation ''1 left is not enough and 1 to the right is way too much!''the physics can fool you really bad! have low expectations of the cars to be able to get going with them!the multiplayer! i can't explain but the de-sync with other racers are EXTREMELY bad, i have an example what i mean with de-sync (in this video my controller was glitching which made the de-sync extremely visible also it is in my own language but you will probably get the idea if you watch it!)

even though with all these negatives i can still play this game, just set the AI difficulty on medium and done! i really do recomend to anyone if you like circuit racing but can't handle the realistic physics this is simple AF! ",62,3,20,2,5,0,0

												I've been through quite a few driving games, looking for one that handled well with an Xbox controller.  This (for me) is by far the best I've found.Most racing games tend to be overly sensitive, especially stearing, using a controller, I found this game to be perfect, and with a lot of variables to adjust.  Very easy to get this set up to your liking.I also love the full customization when it comes to controller assignments.  You'd think that would be standard, but shockingly, there are a few high profile games out there that still don't allow it.Game looks and plays great, carreer mode is reasonably fun, and challenge levels and driver assists are very wide ranged.  You have a lot of control over your experience in this game, can't beat it on sale.			",117,39,8,61,35,2,42

												No C6 ZR1 :( What a shame. Oh well. Also the joy of playing one on one races and spinning out opponents and leaving them in the dust is always quite fun.Pros:- One thing I really like about this game is when you switch to 3rd Person, Hood-cam, or bumper cam, it doesn't do what Gran Turismo does and gives you the games default tach and speedo. Instead it gives you your car's factory tach and speedo.- When you buy and mod a car, if you sell it back, you get all your money back hence why I flip my cars very often so I can try out new cars. - Don't have a racing wheel, gearbox, or pedals. But Gamepad #28 allows you to use clutch :D- Compared to Gran Turismo at least, this game has more freedom when it comes to tuning in most aspects.- Compared to Gran Turismo, customization is much better IMO.Cons:- As one of the reviews pointed out, not all the cars can get ""Work"" done to them so you can't get the S13 to like Tier 3-4 or whatever. but I don't really care since I flip cars every 30 minutes. - I do dislike the aerodynamics upgrade section (just upgrades in general) and how when you go up in tiers, you get less body kits. For example, Tier 1 you get Stage 1-3 body kits, cockpit upgrades, and weight reduction, and just overall upgrades. Tier 2 however, you only get Stage 2 and 3, Tier 3 is only Tier 3. Tier 4 gets nothing. I get that its not Gran Turismo where you can make your Corvette ZR1 or Ford GT have 830+hp with a top speed of 240+mph (can confirm my C6Z and Ford GT in GT5 has hit speeds over 240+) but at the very least give us more than just one stage of aero upgrades, and cockpit upgrades since both of these are cosmetic (bodykits improve braking according to the game). I don't want my C6Z to have a giant wing and full race kit. What if I want something simple like a Supervettes ZR6X kit? What if all I want is a tiny lip spoiler and a front splitter? Nah you get a full race-kit instead.- One thing I liked about Gran Turismo was the power limiter when you tuned your cars. Sadly that is not a tuning option here. I'd say there is a little more freedom in tuning compared to Gran Turismo but they don't have engine tuning which is....not a big deal I guess?- Cosmetic thing but on the Veyron at least, the rear wing/spoiler doesn't pop up at 150mph. Not that I've noticed at least.Conclusion: I personally quite enjoy the game, its not too complicated, Great car selection IMO. The cons to the game can be easily ignored. I don't even care about them if I had to be honest.			",48,4,1,7,5,0,4

												Better than SHIFT 2.This game looks as good if not better than SHIFT 2.  This game runs way better too.  Much better FPS.Lets just get right into it:Pros:Variety of different cars and classes.  Cars feel unique.  AWD feels COMPLETELY DIFFERENT than RWD cars.3 classes of upgrades for your car, and they are all noticeablely better in performance.No stupid story.  youre just some nameless dude and you♥♥♥♥♥♥on nerds with your ricer Lambo.Fun gameplay.  They have all my Nissans so Im good. Good selection of BMWs for all you EuroScrubs (you can rice these too dont worry)Can convert any car into a ricer+++++++now listen here.  This is the biggest plus right here.  I want to commend the developers of this game because listen here, they did the Nitrous PERFECTLY.  No childish ♥♥♥♥ing super hyperspeed effect ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  No ""WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSH"" sound effects. No ♥♥♥♥ing flamethrowers and sparks and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  All it does is just make your car rev super ♥♥♥♥ing fast and you can see your racer guy get pushed back in his seat.  They dont play it up.  They dont make it all cartoon-y. They did it perfectly.  Cons:-Next to no cosmetic customization.  You can change paint, rims. and Vinyls which look like MS paint photoshop ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.-Cant get a wing without also getting a rice as all hell body kit. I kid you not, If you want to be able to adjust your downforce you MUST purchase a body kit (which comes with a wing, in various levels of super rice).-""works"" upgrade rices your car.  When you buy every upgrade for a car, some cars can be upgraded AGAIN.  Its called the ""works"" conversion.  It just makes your car a full out racecar.  its crazy.  The Lamborghini Murcielago Works is literally the best car.  it has the highest score and like almost all perfect stats.  BUT.  The works conversion just rices the hell out of your car.  it made the lambo look disgusting.  And theres nothing you can do about it.  But its a freaking missile so...-not a very big selection of tracks.  All in all, the gameplay is fun.  It's not so childish like some of the NFS games.  Id recommend it.			",37,3,10,8,2,0,1

												If you want a Need For Speed styled track oriented game this is it. Not a game for everyone though, it has its anoying flaws but if you can see past them it will bring you great enjoyment.The beggining is rather slow and the cars are♥♥♥♥♥♥ But keep nailing those races and soon enough you can have a pretty decent car to take on any opponents. And once you unlock the Tier 4 cars (which are the very best) you'll have ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of fun. The MacLaren F1 and the Pagani Zonda are my favorite to drive, but if you like say a more ""normal"" car you can turn it into a beast too (if you can convert it to ""Works"" that is).

The cars look like they are going 20mph when the speedometer says 150 you approach the corner at what you think is very slow and completely slide out of it with the feeling that the steering wheel is doing nothing at all.  The only way to win a race is to go really slow and super careful.  A racing game should be exhilarating, fun, and challenging.  Not slow, boring, and challenging.  DO NOT BUY!!!			",23,1,4,7,3,0,3

												At the beginning it was fun to play, but than when I try to play on advanced or pro setting the AI and physic become one big mess. The game has bugs. car start bouncing and are shot to the air, than game crush: this happens when your car is on gravel or is hit by other cars. Predefined settings for wheels are not working as they should, you need to use the manual setting for custom one.Drift is uhhm.... what to say, frustrating not fun at all (you just need to press the throttle on 100% and spin the wheel like insane and you gain the points. Dream on about to perform precise drift sliding). Some cars keep drift setting also for common tracks which makes them unplayable.Game (40-45% process finished) was deleted and will be  never again installed!!!!!			",273,35,28,18,14,0,20

												To describe this game in one word is that it is TERRIBLE.And I say this with pain in my heart because this game has a lot going for it but let me explain.The graphics are awesome and it has nice tracks and cars with cockpits, but it destroys all of this with all kinds of blurring effects and worst of all the collision blur, which causes your vision to impair for 10 seconds by even the slightest contact.Another problem this game has is that it's unplayable with gamepads, there simply aren't good settings to make steering with a gamepad not feel like your a corddancer who's walking on high heels.Then there are the AI cars which are very aggressive, personally I don't like that, certainly not with the aforementioned collision blur.The last straw are the menu's which are awfull to wade through with a gamepad, though they're somewhat passeble by controlling it with a mouse.

												I chose to pick this up while it was on sale so I could have a decent racing game to use my G27 steering wheel on. I had played this game on PS3 when it came out and I remember it as a fun experience. When I booted it up on PC, however, I could tell that functionality for this PC port was not one of the Developers' priorities. I struggled through the settings menu to fix the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ default graphics and to set up my G27. After about 20 minutes of closing and rebooting the game for the settings to be applied, I finally got in game to the prologue, I guess it could be called, or the tutorial. The forced practice lap after a forced two minute long cutscene. It was almost imposible to control the car! Even without other AI vehicles on the track! Once I finished the lap, it gave me the settings I wanted to adjust, by the way there isn't a settings option when in-game, the assists. I turned them all off. I finally get into the actual first race and the ♥♥♥♥ing behavior of the AI was god damn horrendous. The car didn't respond to my inputs. For those reading and preparing a lecture on how cars actually work in real races and how I know nothing of the real world phyisics, please spare me. The mother mcfreaking car would. not. turn. Then when it would, it would over steer. It was like there was still another sneaky mother ♥♥♥♥ing drive assist that I couldn't turn off. Not to mention the freezes, crashes, and glitches that occure damn near constantly. I really wanted to like this game because of the nestalgia but it didn't live up to any expectations. This was almost the worst $4.39 I've ever spent. This game is not worth it.Thank you, and good day ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I used to enjoy NFS releases. Don't have big expectations with neither one of them. This was a change in the series and I wanted to give it a try. I'm not very good at it and find the tracks a bit difficult to complete them with a good final time. However I still progress through the game. I find that a bit insulting and ultimately it affects my desire to complete the game. Got the game on discount and is the only way you should get the game now. You have much better alternatives for this type of races.			",92,12,5,11,21,0,37

												This is the only Need For Speed game I've played that I didn't care for, and I've been following the franchise since the days it released on 3DO! 1994, was it? Anyway, this feels as far from NFS as it can possibly get. Sure, it's an ok game, but the NFS standard has been raised so high for it to be dropped on its head like this.Maybe it was better back in the day, but it pales in comparison with other NFS titles, mainly NFS: Hot Pursuit (whether you're talking about the new one from 2010, or the older one, NFS3:HP from 1998). The handling of the cars is atrocious, and other reviewers have done a far better job of explaining its shortcomings than I ever could, but steering sucks, acceleration sucks (AI can always accelerate faster than you even when you're in the same cars, and they can always corner better than you can by supplanting the physics of the game and taking curves without sliding; you aren't allowed to do that though!). Touch the steering wheel at the wrong time and you spin out. Run off the track for more than a second, and you get a warning and your time doesn't count. Run off the track too many times, and it's race over for you! Come to a complete stop and then wait about 5 seconds for the game to register that you can drive again. Hate a particular trial? Too bad, you have to master it to continue. Forget overtaking your opponent on most of the time trials...unless you get in front of him somehow in the first turn, he's gone and you can never catch up; you have to get right in front of him and stay there, blocking him from passing the whole time. Not fun!!The unacceptable cons of this game make it unenjoyable to me. Pair that with racetrack only driving and it's not enough to keep me interested.Sorry to say this is my least favorite NFS game I've ever played, and I have played most of them with the exception of maybe Undercover, Rivals, World, and The Run. It never offers anything fun and exciting, just frustration and more frustration.			",283,125,3,33,10,0,12

Need for Speed Shift has the title of not being a Need for Speed beside his name on the store pageWhy this is not a Need for Speed?CustomizationWhy in the world is impossible to tune Tier 4 cars? This is unacceptable.Let's not talk about the customization, instead let's talk about the driving. Is it good?Hehehe, of course NOTI know, i know... It's a racing simulator right?Well tell me if you car JUMPS EVERYTIME in each turn or going 200 km/h in a straight line?In short:+Cockpit view in every car+Nice detail on the tracks+Somewhat rewarding driving+When racing there's no music, i guess for more realistic felling? Well some some realistic feeling?-NO CUSTOMIZATION ON TIER 4 CARS-Fast cars for some reason FLY instead of remaining on the road which makes braking almost     impossible when you have to turn-No Xbox controller support-Drift mode is unplayable-Sometimes the game crashes for some reasonThat's all i have to say...

												It really feels like this game was nothing but a bad attempt to clone a Grid game. The controls are bad, the physics engine is a joke. Frankly, I was quite dissapointed - I was hoping for an arcade racer with NFS style controls and gameplay that would just let me race around tracks and circuts with no crazy storylines or weird gameplay modes. I had high hopes for this game, and I really wanted to give it a chance but after just over an hour of play and a good thirty races under my belt I just wasn't having any fun. This is the first time I have ever requested a refund from Steam.			",157,23,30,29,14,1,22

												Need for Speed SHIFT brings a true driver's experience to some of the world's most iconic racing tracks, including the storied Brand's Hatch in the UK. The game also features the largest roster of high-performance cars in Need for Speed history including race cars such as the Pagani Zonda F, Porsche 911 GT2 and Lotus Elise. Players are thrust into the loud, intense, and athletic experience of racing a car from the driver's perspective through the combination of perception based G-forces, the hyper reality of the cockpit view, and the all-new brutally disorienting crash dynamic. Need for Speed SHIFT features an accurate, accessible physics-based driving model that allows you to feel every impact, every change of track surface and every last bit of grip as you push yourself to the edge.

This should at least be included in the loading screen*After race results only show total time. Would of been nice to see the car driven and best lap, as included in most other racing games*Controls are not shown with proper Xbox button prompts*Sound is insanely loud, had to turn everything down to 15, even with windows at 50% volumeBleh!*AI is awful, constant crashing into you and in turns, braking in straightaways*Menus are awful. Changing graphics is difficult as it goes by some random 3 digit number, some stuff is buried in odd places*The car turning and traction feels off to me on anything under tier 3, they are way too lose and feel like your driving on ice even when fully upgradedVerdict: All and all its a very mediocre race title, better then most of the newer NFS though. THe lower tier cars having awful handling kills it for me, along with a AI that acts more like a 16 year old with their permit, instead of ""pro"" level drivers that they are suppose to be			",439,121,12,73,77,7,70

												Ive never written a review in my life. But here i am, because... well WOW. Ive never gotten so frustrated so quickly from any game in my life. The game advertises as more of a realistic driving experience. Well its not. First thing i did was disable all assits and put it in manual (as usual), and buy my ae86. Ive never played such an unrealistic game before. Hitting a corner at 160km in a stock ae86, and without braking, just a downshift and cranck the wheel and im hugging the track like a train and stayin on course without issue!?!?! There is no realism to this AT ALL. The handling is way outa wack. Everything is off, im counter steering, when apparently i dont need to cause the cars auto pulling out of corners.... I am beyond annoyed. This game would be GREAT, if it was advertised as such ""An unrealistic, simple aracde racer for fun epic races!"" But when advertised as a realistic physics based game, it is NOTHING as to what i was lead to believe when i purchased the game. I would like my money back, as i feel mislead and robbed.

												The game itself isn't that bad, considering it's quite old.Due to some really annoying flaws, however, which I'll list below, I am not recommending it.Note: I'm using a Thrustmaster T500 RS wheel + Thrustmaster TH8A shifter, which are not supported, but they work, and the controls are alright.1: In the menus you can't use any of the wheels buttons. It's a standard layout, with a D-Pad and 4 buttons, much like Playstation and Xbox Controllers. Even though it's not officially supported, it's a complete joke that those won't work in the menu, especially if they work with any normal key bind you can set in the menu.2: The optimization is downright awful. i7-4770, GTX 760, 8GB RAM merely get you a 60 FPS on 1080p on MEDIUM settings, that is WITHOUT motion blur and texture filtering at MINIMUM.3: The option menu, specifically graphic settings are another huge ♥♥♥♥ up. This is one of the games where you have to restart the whole game whenever you change most of the settings. That's pretty bad already, but it gets even worse if you are testing different settings to reach decent quality/framerate ratio.It even offers me 144 hertz mode, even though the game doesn't even support it. It'll just go back to 60 hertz upon restarting.4. Some of the cars have 7 gears, just like my TH8A shifter, but you can even shift into the 7th gear on cars that don't even have 7 gears. It will display that you're in 7th gear, but it won't accelerate any further. That's just ridiculous and shows how much the programmers thought about what they're doing.If you have one of the wheels that are supported or use a controller, this might be a good game for you, though it's quite hard to play with a controller if you don't use assists at later stages in the game.

												I bought this game on the steam sale because I've always been a fan of need for speed and really enjoyed prostreet. Prostreet was fun with decent physics aside from the bs car damage model. I thought since this was the next need for speed track racing game that it would improve upon all the things that made Prostreet great. Nope. I spent $5 on this game and felt like I wasted my money. I wouldn't play this♥♥♥♥♥♥if it were free. The physics and handling are absolutely awful and unless you like spinning out every corner,  unrealistic phyiscs, and a bigger sense of dissappointment in EA than you already had, don't buy this game. If you can handle a lower frame rate and worse graphics but much better car models, play prostreet and you wont be dissappointed.			",17,0,3,0,2,0,0

												Unless you have a gaming pad, or a steering wheel you simply can't play this game. But even with, the game is insanely hard to control.This game is completely unplayable. On a totally reasonable machine the frame rate is awful. The steering takes forever to respond so you fishtail off the track constantly. And the worst part is, you can't skip any cut scenes and you cant modify graphic settings or control settings in game, and there's only career mode when you start. so you have to watch all the cutscenes (which bug out and play 2 to 3 times in a row) at the begining of the career, find out the controls are still impossible, and then you can't even quit back to the menu, so you have to force quit and restart to change your settings. and being an EA game they make you watch their stupid logo every single time you turn the game on and warnings about driving.  I've done the first and second race a bunch of times now and i can't find a way to even control the game.  I've owned hundreds of games in my life, dozens of racers, and Ive never been more♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that a company has the audacity to sell this.			",39,5,1,8,0,0,5

												No. No, no, no. SMS did NOT know what they were doing. (Which also shows in Project Cars. Oh, the irony.)The menus don't work half the time.Save corruption happens 8 times out of 10.90% of the cars steer like boats in a sea of molasses.Textures are just plain trash. SM64 had better textures than this game.The game itself runs like absolute trash (Locked at 45 FPS on my PC for some reason), often dipping below 30 FPS.The AI is plain broken and the rubber-banding is REAL. This is even worse than Mario Kart's AI AND the Goron AI from the Goron race minigame from TLoZ: Majora's Mask.A Golf can keep up with an S2000. That's how bad it is.			",115,5,3,13,7,0,4

												Instead of telling you guys in a paragraph about this game, I felt that it would be better to give a pro and con list.Pro's: - It's like Forza, I enjoy a game like that- Graphics are nice- Any kind of Gamer can play this gameCon's:- Badly Optimized, The Crew runs at 60+FPS and The Crew is a bit more demanding- Long; Unskippable; Boring Cutscenes- Motion Blur is annoying in Racing GamesNeutral:- Not Like Need For Speed Games- Better then most of The Need For Speed Games- Forza or Gran Turismo like game but on PCOverall The reason I don't reccomend it is because the con's really effect the actual gameplay, espeacially the poor framerate, and I tryed setting them down to minimal and it was still getting (MinFPS: 12 MaxFPS: 45 AvgFPS: 24) which was horrible, I'm used to playing any other game with atleast 60fps and this game just destroyed optimal gaming. During Testing I was using a computer that is considered medium end (Nvidia 750ti, 16gb DDR3 Ramm, AMD FX-8350 5.0GHz) so I was expecting to atleast be able to play it without lag. If it runs it runs but on my side, it wasn't very good. Buy at Your own risk			",181,25,6,20,21,1,16

												Honestly, Im of the people who miss the Underground days of NFS. And after I played Pro Street (on Wii regrettably) I decided to give the series quits. And the game was on Sale a few months ago, and I reminisced about the Thousands of hours I spent on my PS2 on NFSU and NFSU2, I bought the game.The game plays like a NFS game, good controls, Easy interface, Car Customisation. But its a Racetrack racer similar to Pro Street. But I preferred this game to NFS prostreet.However, that doesn't mean i'd recommend it to anyone other than a Die-Hard racer. Any Gran Turismo/Forza will do better if you want a Race track racer, and If you want customisation. Both GT and Forza have Customisation elements, but not like NFS. And there is a Xp ""grind"" that gives the RPG like rewards and challenges, which I honestly did not enjoy.Overall. Better than Shift 2 that I played on PS3, but still not like the Innovation that NFSU brought. Only get if you're a Die-Hard racer type, or a Fan of grindy-Racing games (Just get Forza 5). Otherwise save your money.			",230,42,18,41,31,5,43

												Ehhh.. I dunno about NFS SHIFT This game has some major flaws that keeps me from wanting to click that Play button.I'm running windows 7 and while in full screen mode if I alt-tab out and try and come back.. it's done crashes every single time, time to restart.Controller support is terrible.  I have a wheel that I play with sometimes.. and a game pad I play with sometimes. If I set the custom wheel up.. then go to switch to custom gamepad.. Bye bye settings, I have to remap all the buttons for either.. so you are forced to pick one and stick with it, there is no way to save your mappings. Gameplay has been fun so far but it's hard for me to want to play when I know that I""m going to need to remap or that if I change focus to check e-mail or chat with someone quick that the game quits.

												The Henessy Venom reportedly is the fastest production car in the world. Going flat out, it will give the Bugatti Veryron SS a run for its money. However, this game is old, and despite the presence of the Veyron in the game, the fastest car is the Pagani Zonda R. How could this happen you ask? Well, NFS Shift is a racing simulator, so its main focus is on stuff like horsepowers, downforce, grip, and coachwork damage. When you add up all those numbers, the only outcome can be that the track-optimised Zonda R is the best. It is light, has a stupidly big wing on the back. Points and fins sticking out to maintain that perfect racingline. The Veyron is too fat, the GTR too weak, the Reventon is too silly and the Vette is too uncontrollable. And the game knows this. No matter what race you drive in higher tiers, the one in first place will be a Zonda R, or you...in a Zonda R. The game is a Zonda R sim then. It tries to emulate the laws of physics on the track, so it is imperative you understand the properties of traction. You can't floor it and shoot off. You'll spin in place. So you need to gently feather it. That is, if you turn all the assists off. The game offers you assistance with everything; braking, accelerating, turning, the works. However, the point is that it controls like a shed on an ice rink. Turn right = either going right too fast and spin, or go right slowly and go off. You can like this kind of realistic driving, but I favour a more arcade approach. I like exotic supercars and doing 200mp/h on the straight, but this game, just is too narrow, too scarce. It is brutally overshadowed by newer, more inclusive racing games. On top of that, the game's soundtrack is a collection of nails on chalkboard. Luckily you don't have to hear it because the engine noise is overly loud. The coolest part though is your ability to paint your car in some funny ways. Unfortunately, if that is the staying point of your game, then you need to reevaluate your priorities.   ",192,21,8,22,19,2,33

												Need for Speed™ SHIFT is an award-winning authentic racing game that combines the true driver’s experience with real-world physics, pixel-perfect car models, and a wide range of authentic race tracks. Need for Speed SHIFT takes players in a different direction to create a simulation experience that replicates the true feeling of driving high-end performance cars. Players are thrust into the loud, visceral, intense, athletic experience of racing a car on the edge of control from the driver’s perspective through the combination of perception based G-forces, the hyper reality of the cockpit view, and the brutal experience of a first person crash dynamic. Need for Speed SHIFT features an accurate, accessible physics-based driving model that allows you to feel every impact, every change of track surface and every last bit of grip as you push yourself to the edge. - True Driver's Experience - A variety of visual cues delivers the true driver’s experience including a three-dimensional HUD that mimics driver head movement, inertia and G-forces. The depth of field also adjusts based on the speed of the car; so when the car is traveling at high speeds the perspective will shift to the distance putting the car/cockpit out of focus. - Driver Profile - What kind of driver are you? Driver profile tracks the player’s evolution as a race driver from event to event. This system is made up of a driver’s personality on the track, their success rate and any profile points and badges accrued all of which work together to create a tailor-made career and game play experience. Driver profile is pervasive throughout all modes: career and online. - Dynamic Crash Effect - When the player hits a static object or opponent car, the player will feel like they are 'taking damage'. A combination of visual and audio effects will leave the player disoriented and briefly disrupt the race. - Total Customization - Need for Speed SHIFT features a comprehensive customization option that lets the player tailor every aspect of the cars performance and styling. Go under the hood to upgrade and tune your vehicle to increase its performance. The visual customization system allows players to personalize both the exterior and trick out the interior to reflect their individual style and preferences. - Photo-Realistic Cars and Tracks - Nearly 70 licensed cars are available including the Pagani Zonda F, Audi RS4, and Porsche 911 GT3 RSR. There is also over 15 real-world locations like Willow Springs and Laguna Seca as well as fictional circuits like downtown London and Tokyo.			",1115,462,53,160,159,14,251

												Y'know, I really like this one.  I think it's a great balance between the pure arcade glee of the usual NFS games, and the zero tolerance simulation of Gran Turismo.  It's hard enough that you can feel like you accomplished something when you beat the harder levels, but not GT5-hard where you might as well restart the level if your tires chirp going around a turn.  Highly recommended.			",1436,570,96,171,159,22,219

												I've played this game prior to actually purchasing the game because the concept of the game made perfect sense to me: Like ProStreet but with better visuals, streamlined tuning and an updated physics engine which allowed for better handling. So imagine my disappointment when I found the controls so messed up that every car was nearly undrivable - so bad to the point which I shunned the game for several years.Fast forward to a few months ago when I saw this on sale a few months back, as part of the EA pack which was sold dirt cheap by result of a sale, I was willing to give this another chance, given that they have had several years to patch the handling issues and the fact that driving with a controller was now an option (in the absence of a wheel).First impressions were okay, but not outstanding. Updates were definitely made to improve the handling such that cornering was now less of an oversteery affair and thus manageable, but it wasn't as precise as I would have liked or expected of a game with an emphasis on simulation (Think Colin McRae: Dirt and Race Driver: GRID). I also took note that with my Xbox 360 controller, every car I used seemed unable to travel in a straight line - slightly drifting to the left or right as though I was driving a car with either alignment problems or an extremely bad case of torque steer (A problem further exacerbated by the rather imprecise controls). These went mostly unnoticed at first since it gave me a greater challenge than previous driving games which I've played. As the game progressed, however, it became increasingly more noticeable and thus more annoying as trying to follow the racing line became more and more difficult, with many attempts resulting in an unscheduled trip off the track and never returning to the track ever again as though its been sucked into some sort of vehicular black hole off the track. This was extremely frustrating as this mainly happened on the straights, because (as previously stated) of the car's ability (or lack thereof) to maintain a straight line. Then I reached the drifting competitions.Oh god the drifting competitions. These were impossible. Never has any driving game I've played made drifting such a tortuous act that I've had to avoid them. To put the problem simply: Inaccurate throttle response (A flaw from using a controller that isn't really noticeable in normal racing) + Inaccurate handling = Undrivable Spinout Central. Looking back, I'm amazed that I even managed to win one of those because the car was so eager to either spin out or understeer due to what i assumed to be actually proper braking.Customization-wise, the game seems extraordinarily dull. Sure, you get the standard selection of paints, vinyls and rims, but its all put in a way that seems slow, tedious, restricted (in some cases) and ultimately not very fun, especially when they give you a bunch of preset liveries for each car which look much better than what can be done by yourself.What is commendable though is the AI, which at times seem realistic as you see drivers lock up as they miss a braking point and occasionally spin each other out and run into the gravel trap. Other times, though they can be extremely unreasonable, taking corners at speeds which I couldn't possibly achieve and lapping at a pace which, given cars of similar power and weight, cause me to call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on them.Overall, I didn't like this game. My experience of this game now was certainly much better than it was years ago, but the difference is like comparing a mosquito bite to a bee sting - it still hasnt made it a good game. Sure, having a wheel would have arguably made my experience better, but good driving games don't need players to have a wheel in order to have fun or allow players to drive properly - good driving games allow people to have fun even when all you have is a keyboard. This, among many reasons is why NFS: Shift is not a good game nor a good driving game which I will not reccommend to anyone, not even the hardcore racers.			",321,84,24,46,27,8,41

												EDIT:I always think to myself 'you really need to play this for a bit longer before reviewing' and this time out, that instinct was definitely right. Early on the game doesn't feel all that different from the average racing game (the physics engine just wasn't able to show off) but around Tier 3 the game really begins to 'shift gears,' so to speak.I'd highly recommend this game to people who want a controller-compatible racing game to sit down with.9/10			",107,57,4,30,26,3,35

												Really good racer. At times its sim elements may be a little lacking and the game gives you points for almost everything you do, but it has a really diverse mixture of tracks from the ever-breathtaking Spa to some interesting original tracks developed by the NFS Shift team.In terms of a fun drive with a challenge for racing fans, there isn't much out there to beat the Shift series.8.5/10			",114,10,19,26,9,0,20

												Absolutely fantastic racing sim. An real win!WARNING: You really won't get the most out of this game without a controller. I'm just using a wired Xbox controller -before using it, the ""Drift"" mode races were impossible to master with a keyboard as you need to control the ""amount"" of throttle.Given a good controller, if you're into precision racing and are a perfectionist with your driving technique (or aspire to be), then you are going to LOVE NFS Shift.If however you are an arcade racer and just wanna smash other cars, and are generally the kind of racer who slides off the track a lot, you might find NFS SHIFT, somewhat of a frustrating game.I played it on my bro's PS3, then wondered why the experience wasn't the same on PC. After getting an Xbox controller it all makes sense. I rate it!			",97,3,3,2,4,1,4

												A racing simulation they said yet what you get is actually more a blend of both sim and arcade based driving which if your a Grid fan, will see you instantly at home.A step away from the usual NFS formula, this attempt is a reasonable addition even if lacking in a few areas.Reasonable amount of cars to choose from, nice tracks to race on and enough upgrades.rims and decor to keep the NFS fanboy happy. Theirs no grown up on the wrong side of the tracks, or aspiring young rookie based story here, its just subwalls of different tiers, making the overall experience less immersive, less personal. Within the tiers are different competitions, racing,hot laps,eliminators and drift also containing various requirements inorder to enter. While the race handling was competent, the drifting was poor but considering its limited use throughout the game does not make the game impossible to complete if ignored all together but be warned level 50 wont be achieved without it.NFS shift is a good crack at a track racing game and although not that markedly different to other  games in the genre is well worth picking up in a sale.

												For a sim-arcade mix, this is a decent racing game. Handling/physics model is alright, but the cars seem too tail happy. The graphics for this 6 year old game are acceptable. 1st person view looks good and is very immersive. Track variation is good; however, there are a lot of races on sections of the Nurburgring Nordschleife, and it does get repetitive. Cars selection is varied and car customization is generous. Money is plentiful to the point where buying the best car in the class is effortless. AI can be aggressive and don't have a sense of surroundings. NOTE: Used controller.Overall, it's a fair simcade racer. There are better options for a simcade. Would recommend but buy on sale. 7/10			",55,3,6,4,8,0,2

												Y'know, I really like this one.  I think it's a great balance between the pure arcade glee of the usual NFS games, and the zero tolerance simulation of Gran Turismo.  It's hard enough that you can feel like you accomplished something when you beat the harder levels, but not GT5-hard where you might as well restart the level if your tires chirp going around a turn.  Highly recommended.			",1436,570,96,171,159,22,219

												I was really enjoying this game until I finally got to the more difficult levels. Once you unlock the faster cars, the driving just stops being fun. It's a bit weird, since in most racing games one is most anxious to reach the high-performance tiers, however here it just feels like you are riding the brakes constantly, since most of the courses are very tight.Also, there are a bunch of bugs in this game which start to get rather annoying. High-speed collisions can result in a car being ""stuck"" halfway inside of the pavement. The drift races are not much fun at all and actually rather tedious to complete. It feels like the drifting was added in as a last-minute feature; it should have just been left out of this game entirely.			",257,85,7,21,24,3,27

												Took a bit of effort to start the game up without it stuttering and it still crashes if I Alt+TAB out of it, but I'm still giving it a thumbs up.When setting everything to full-realistic, the damage taken by the car doesn't seem to have any affect on how it handles. The rest is pretty good and tough to master. Go into a corner too fast and you're skidding right into the curb.For some reason there's a whole bunch of cars in my garage that I can't use. I've no idea why they're there. There's a bit too much unskippable splash and glamor and your race stats (precision/aggressive) flash away too fast for you to read them.The driving's good though.7/10			",120,5,6,11,11,0,8

												Great racing game. It takes some practice, but it seems anyone can get a hang of handling their vehicle quite quick. As well I like the control you have over your car visually and as well how it's tuned, unlike NFS Hot Persuit (2010).However there are only two downsides. I've found that there were a few senarios that the menu was forcing me to either continue playing, or else force the game shut. Yet one problem that is game breaking is if the window is no longer in focus, it will crash.It's a great game in general and a fun one to play with your friends.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have played probably close to 50 hours outside of steam.  This game is a classic, if you enjoy GRID or the other NFS games.  I'd recommend it for the 5 bucks or less on sale.  Worth it for the cars and tracks, and just pure enjoyment.			",196,29,21,15,16,0,18
