												First Impression ReviewSo I have a couple of hours under my belt in this new instalment and figured it's time to give you guys some feedback. I will update this later after a couple of full seasons.Is this game fun? Yeah I would say so. If you like Motogp then it does what it needs to (just).Is it much of an upgrade to Motogp 14? Nope, not really. Cosmetics and small tweaks only (so far).Should the die-hard Motogp fans buy it? Absolutely, it has a nice feel to it and obviously it is updated with this seasons riders and such. It is still very much lacking in features that other driving sims have, hell even other sport games. But for the motogp series, it is slowly getting better...very slowly though.Should casual players buy it? That depends on if they have any previous instalments of the game. If they have 2014 I would say no, wait for next year. It is another of those games that only get small adjustments each year so just buy every other one or grab it on a 50% sale later in the year. I do not honestly think It is worth shelling out all that cash each year for a casual player on a game that always seems much like it could just be a DLC to the previous year.Pro'sThe bikes seem to be a little bit more responsive this year in cornering(motogp at least), it is fun to leave some black lines out of corners and pull wheelies on the  moto3 bikes. Nothing you would really notice unless you have played motogp 14 within the last couple of days but it is there.Slight wind wobble on the camera at high speeds, that seems to have been updated for this year and gives it a more realistic feel.Custom bikes in career mode. It's not all singing and all dancing but it's about time we got this feature.Seeing dry lines appear towards the end of a drying out qualifying session is nice. Yeah it may be 2015 and this should not be a surprise in this day and age but it still gave me a little lip curl. Con's The AI seem to fall off very easily if you bump them. I have noticed this while giving the game a try on medium AI so I will update this a little more when I try out the pro settings a little later.It really isn't the best racing sim out there, it's more aimed at giving the motogp gearheads their fix for the year and making milestone some money. The same company also make Ride and the MXGP games and they are all pretty poor bike sims so dont get your hopes up for an amazing game.My rider looks way too shiny in the wet. Graphics wise this game is still pretty poor, I don't see much of a difference on last years edition and some tracks look pretty empty.Some strange sound effects... like crashing for instance, it just doesnt sound like it should.--All in all, Milestone need a good kick in the butt. Motogp still doesn't have a brilliant game like it should. If you like Motogp you will enjoy playing this game. It is not total crap like some would say but it is not much of an improvement on last year, just as last year was not much better than 2013. For me, it feeds my need for bike racing and as I said before, if you are a casual player, just buy it on a sale or every other year.For what this game is, i would say 8/10 this year. Milestone need to try harder next year though.Judged against other racing sims, pfft 6/10I will recommend for now--			",66,9,6,11,6,2,9

												i crashed too much in this game, need to get used to the physics (RIDE + GP13 mix). marquez; ""with 2014 bike, I create that slide. Now the problem is that the bike creates the slide, and I try to avoid it""in my case, in GP14 i create that slide/skid into the corner, but now GP15 bike creates that slide then i crash, loli still prefer GP14's physics, but yeah its a good game overall... pros :- better graphics, effects, so on. but color is kind of strange in shadow (assen starting grid), & in the rain- AA is back but not great, 8x AA the jaggies still present tho- more detail circuit, but Laser scan circuit on Project Cars & GRID/F1 is more acurate- wet race is more easier & fun- tyre wear is more forgiving than gp14 on 5 laps race distance (online race) didn't tried on 10/15laps yet- trading cards :Pcons :- its Milestone, we need Codesmaster to takeover MotoGP- no steamworks- MotoGP bikes strange corner crash (eg: Brno turn5 right handed, PI turn6 siberia..) Moto2/3 is fine- weird start > gear one, i just pull the throttle 100% (tcs off), the engine seems to cut the power instead of wheely? the start isnt challenging anymore- the transmission doesnt feel seamless, just like RIDE's production bike- crash on wrong place & still got penalty (i dont have any intention to take a shortcut, doh!!!)- 1.5gb vs 4gb texture, dont notice any diferentupdate :- if u hosting a lobby, randomly freeze during the race still present (since gp13-14), if this happen on the long straight is np, but if in the mid-corner its disaster, ur bike go straight into the wall/speedtrap gravel or high side crash instantly!! (u loose the battle with other rider or even the chance to fight for the victory/podium at least) not happen in every race but can happen 1-2 times in single race... - uh uh one more thing, my question just got answered by the recent event (Assen race)i'd been thinking for a long time if this stuff really happen in the real race, but hey it does!! Its kind of failed 'superman' freestyle trick on x-games then stupidly hanging off the side of the bike sooo clumsy & nothing u can do really (need to wobble 1st, but u know what i mean :P). Moto3 rider Niklas Ajo shows stunning commitment, crossing the finish line on his knees after a spectacular save.. Happen a lot to me tho since gp13, but after fantastic Ajo's happening, its a big relief (i thought milestone was trolling about this) fiuh...			",196,26,19,15,25,0,14

												So far so good, Ive been playing these moto gp games since gp 12, and I gotta say this was worth the money. it has all the updated riders for 2015, you can finally customize your own team, and bike which is fun to play around with, and there is a big difference between the handling in all the bikes, just like in real life. The ducati motorcycles are known for there power, but they are unstable. and the suzuk motorcycles have good handling, but down on power.Overall Its a good good espically at this time being that its  a few bucks off original price.  RIDE was a good game but it had a good set of problems, even know there were more selctions of bikes the problems did not out weigh them. For instince the online racing has yet to be fixed from glitches, so after you play the story mode. (which will take about 60-70 hours) I was wanting to play in the onlime servers, but they were so glitchy, and there was only a total of like 10 people online so it was impossible to find a match. I was worried Moto gp would follow in the footsteps of ride, but I have NEVER experinced a glitch on moto gp 15, I had some timing problems when exiting the pit, but thats it.Good buy, would recomend espically for the price.

												Fun game, definitely better than the previous ones in terms of performance, looks and amount of bugs. Handling is also a bit better and it isn't as forgiving as last year's game. Apart from that there's a few new game modes but nothing really spectacular.All in all, if you already own MotoGP 13 or 14 I wouldn't consider it worth the Â£35 since you're basically getting a slightly less buggy and better looking reskin of 14. If, however this is your first Moto GP game, definitely pick it up. It has a really fun career mode which will keep you entertained for a long time and a bunch of other fun gamemodes if you get sick of career mode.			",43,4,21,4,11,0,1

												Big problem for me... I use onboard view and in moto 3 I cant see a thing through the near solid grey flyscreen. Basically its impossible to ride in this view. I have been using this view for years. So far this expirience has been terrible for me. Also the graphics are just as bad if not worse than the last motogp. Engine sound is terrible too... maybe slightly improved? Comparing anything of this game alongside the detail and sound of games like project cars its just terrible. I really dont know what to say! Milestone never help the people who have had problems yet give them the money for these games. I think most importantly Milestone are the issue here. Maybe a petition on Change.org mght start the ball rolling?			",39,2,15,1,14,1,0

												MotoGP 15 is an exceptional bike racing game, after a few hours practice with a decent controller (recommend xbox one controller for PC) you can master the art of racing these wonderful machines. I know that I will be playing this game for a long time to come. There's nothing bad I can say about this game, it more than met my expectations. Fantastic job!			",350,92,50,42,101,1,85

MotoGPâ¢15 is a one of the many motorcycle racing game and, as it has also proven in 2015 edition, it is almost certainly the best game there is of this genre. If you're interested in racing games, be sure to have a look.If this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.What is happening in the game:As you probably know, the point of this game is to race and, if you're good enough, win the race. With diverse customisation, you are able to modify your vehicle just the way you want. There are a lot of tracks to drive on and also games modes, including instant race and championship. Well, it's exactly what you would expect from a racing game.Pros: I can't go past the graphics in my review. You might think that the screenshots are much better than the actual gameplay (as publishers usually make screenshots look astonishingly good), but in this case, the truth is not far behind. On several graphic options, from low to high, the game looked good. The driving feels nice. I had some issues with controlling the vehicle (will be described in the Cons section), but when I fixed all the issues, my driving experience was excellent. There are 18 tracks in this game and, as I understood, all of them are also a part of the real 2015 championship. In case you need one, there is a pretty decent tutorial when you first start the game with the announcer guiding you through the game mechanics. Some AAA companies these days are obsessed with DRM, but that doesn't seem to be the case in this game. You can freely play in offline mode any time you want. Both your motorcycle and your outfit can be customisable with different colours, numbers and texts. There are also different weather conditions.Cons: The controller is a driving device by default and the game wants it to stay this way. When I make the keyboard the default playing device, this setting is reset every time I turn on the game. If you have a QWERTZ keyboard instead of QWERTY, as I do, you should know that this game detects Y, when you press Z. I had quite some problems with that, as the default braking key is Z and I couldn't even brake before I figured this out. As I've heard, there is not much difference from this game and its ancestor (MotoGP 14). Sometimes, bots fall of their bikes very quickly on contact. No biggie. No MacOS and Linux support? Come on, we're not in the 19th century!The final verdict:This game is awesome and, truth be told, I didn't expect anything else from an AAA game. Graphics are great, the feeling is great, the maps are great and controlling is great (after a few tweaks, if you have a keyboard). I had a lot of fun playing this and I don't consider myself the biggest fan of racing games. This game makes you excited when you play it even if you're not among the first on finish every time.Buy it if you can. You won't be disappointed.Greetings,BirdCuteNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

												Great Game, Great Physics, Great Graphics, 2015 Season Moto3 Moto 2 and MotoGP, where this one differs is you can run your own team, dev your bikes and come up through the ranks, and as awsome side note some of the Best riders have been added in 2 stroke mode and challenges and those things are awsome. there is still the grind of coming up through all the classes but the game play and feel of immersion is so good you just keep riding.So yes if you live bikes and MotoGP get this one it is worth the money i loved 2013 skipped 14 and adore 15 and seeing how the real 15 championship went down i love putting the cocky lil MM#93 on hisâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥every chance i get ;)			",42,7,45,0,22,0,3

												Do not buy this game. If you had previous versions, it's the same game with rider updates. Want to go through a full week end of racing and have fun? Ofcourse you do. Does Milestone think the same way? Ofcourse not, because F*ck you, they got your money. You want an example. Set up your bike during practice and qualifying which happens to be dry weather. Warm ups and race in the rain. Different year, same problem. During the warm up, they reset your settings. Good luck finding these or trying to load these, cause they've been saved under dry. Now you don't have a template. 12 mins to set up or find the template again, no thank you. It's like watching Rossi raging because it's raining on race day and he has no set up, because his mechanic brought in a new bike. That always happens.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Jacko Rating 8.5/10The best yet in the MotoGP series!  Graphics, audio and gameplay opitions all exceed the previous versions and the physics are not altered too much but rather just tweaked a little for the better.If you have ever wanted to play a GP game on bikes then this is your best choice.  From the true to real life specs on all bikes and riders plus the TV style broadcast of the race this game gets as close as possible to actually having the opportunity to ride a real GP bike.Create your rider and race him up through the ranks of Moto 3, Moto2 and finally MotoGP along the way negotiating contracts with teams or now you can start your own private team to compete with the big boys.You are given rewards in the form of Photos of real life riders in action and HD Videos of the same as you win more and more races and level up.To sum up a very accessable game for newbies to the genre and has enough tweaks and new additions to keep us MotoGP fans happy with the purchase of the latest addition to the franchise.Nice Job!

												Another failure from milestone. Selling ,as usual, full priced updates as games, to fix bugs from last year edition.One of the most horrific aspects of the game is the sound engine. It's ear bleeding,far from real counterparts (alot far exept for Yamaha wich is ""kinda"" there) plus let me tell you one thing : Honda and Suzuki have 2 different engines and trust me, they don't sound the same...Milestone had the brilliant idea to put the Honda sound samples (that is not even accurate) for both bikes (wich btw suck hard). I really don't know where milestone wants to go with this policy but for sure they won't get anywhere close to their objective.  The controls are UNRESPONSIVE. The rider takes ages to lift from the lowest position when it's time to break hard before a turn making the back wheel lift all the time as the game engine recons the center of balance still in the front. And that's only one aspect of what's wrong in this game.It seems the devs absolutely don't get how exactly a bike handling works, nor the physics around it. Poor set up options are also extremely frustrating, having a bar with no value for reference is a no go for a wannabe sim.Today I played sbk generations...I wish those days will come back. EVERYTHING about that OLD game is better than this crap and I'm, once again, extremely disappointed with Milestone.   Refund for me. ",145,7,6,14,13,1,27

												The first time I played a moto gp racing game was on the SEGA Megadrive, and actually  got into the game quite a bit and could really hammer it round the tracks.Before I bought this I owned MotoGP2 on the original Xbox and really quite enjoyed the game with friends.I thought that like all progressive yearly games like FIFA, Football Manager, NHL, NBA etc.. etc.. the game would have pushed to improve and become more like the real thing.This game is an appauling joke, is this really the best Motorcycle based game we have?  This development team have been doing this for years but they clearly have not put any effort into ther physics for the bike, the tracks, the sounds, the menu system or the career feature.  This game is certainly not any better than the xbox version I owned.  This company are CLEARLY MILKING the franchise for all it is worth, what a disgusting business model.MotoGP should have their license taken away and be stopped immediately.This game is ugly to look at, ugly to play, the sounds are pathetic (no sound of air for example) and OVERPRICED does not even begin to capture how I feel about this game.Steer clear this game is so poor :(			",50,26,20,0,51,1,8

												I haven't played previous MotoGP titles. So, I am highly impressed and recommend this game ""IF"" you like to play in first person view with no riding aids. There are always room for improvements, specially on the visual quality. But despite all the critisism Milestone developers get, they are indeed the masters of simulating motorcycle racing successfully. As they are the handful of guys creating such games, I am thankful to that :)  PROS- - Handling is near perfect and refined. Physics feels really good as you progress from lower classes to higher ones. Handling is challanging but still fun.- Visually not that demanding and looks decent at fluid 60fps. - The game has high replay value. I find mastering corners and improving time in time attack mode quite satisfying. After nearly 80hrs, I am still about to start in moto2 from moto3 in career mode on simulation difficulty.- AI is quite good and competitive to play offline. Online community is quite challanging as well.- motogp madness experience...visually :) Loved the included multimedia videos as well CONS (so to say)- - It feels as if the PC version is not a priority and has been ported from ps4 version. Visually it can be more refined.- Online latency can be an issue sometimes. Also lobby rules and structure can be improved. Things like showing time left for qualifying sessions, ability to join qualifying in progress, skipping session and host transfer can be very helpful.- Inaccurate leaderboards. Times way lower than real records takes away the sim factor :PBoth ""Ride"" and ""motogp"" are good games. I play these games with xbox controller and have my G27 eating dust since I bought these. VR might change that. So I hope Milesone are also working on next version of their games with driveclub quality graphics and VR support.			",5,1,11,0,0,0,0

												Being a motogp fan from day dot. The motogp series has always been worth a look at least. This version of motogp is one of the best so far over all. Sure there are the odd niggle here and there , but i don't think I have ever played a perfect p.c game.Considering motorcycling is not as main stream as car racing , no big company has reallly tackled motorbikes and racing to make a truly awsome masterpiece like grand turismo did etc. ... there was tourist trophy on Play station 2 but that was years ago and that game didn't have enough bikes really.I sure hope someone will produce a true bike sim , something like 'Project Cars' on p.c where the physics / graphics and sound can all be pushed to the maximum.The sound could be better in this game considering we are in the year 2015. Over all though i would recommend this game to anyone who likes racing motorcycles and motogp. The graphics are great! the physics are not all too bad and the sense of speed and the smoothness of the game have been greatly improved.The Rider animations have been improved on - now the Riders head moves properly in the turn and there is even more body movement - what this does is it gives you more scope to push every last drop of performance out of the bikes.The edition of the old 990 cc Motogp fourstrokes dlc was a good idea , i loved thoses bikes when they came out and milestone has made a good model for these monster race bikes.Also of note , there is a good difference between the years of the bikes in power and handling and in this version of the motogp game ALL bikes go really fast and are quite aggressive . In simulation mode it is easyer to highside the motorcycle.As of writing this, i have put in well over 24 hours with this game and it still feels like I hav't scratched the surfice of the depth of the game as there are a lot of bikes and riders in this game.Hey Milestone ! .... how about and upgraded version of your World Superbikes Race game sim. Ride shows that superbikes could be quite popular.Graphics 8/10Sound  5/10Physics 8/10longevity 8/10Fun 9/10Realism 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Finally a decent MotoGP game from Milestone.It seems like they actually listen to the feed back on their previous releases.The visuals of the bikes/riders and track is great now. Gameplay and physics are the best they've been for awhile, though there still appears to be some traction/wheelie control even when you have it turned off.Downsides is that it crashes fairly often, say every 2-3 sessions it would crash...Sound is ok but still miss some of the great audio of early MotoGP games (before Milestone)DLC is a waste of time and money.But given i've been dissapointed year after year, this is actually a nice surprise.

												I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!I am a bit of a motorcycle freak if that means anything....The graphics are awesome.Gameplay and framerate is very good.AI is very good.Tracks are accurate and beautiful.Gameplay is immersive!This game will transport you into the MotoGP world and instead of just playing a racing game, you will actually feel like you are racing for your career, as the career mode is VERY realistic and not so easy. Get ready for all the emotions that real MotoGP riders have to go through.....Join a team or start your own team....love the choices!Speaking of choices.....read up on motorcycle dynamics and setting up your bike for different racing tracks and so on....as this WILL have an impact on your race results, as can be expected as this is also true in real life.Gear ratios, Suspension, Breaks....and and and and.....I would recommend playing it with a PS3 or XBOX controller, as you will struggle with the keyboard.The controller gives you more control VS the keyboard.Example: 1) With the keyboard you can apply the breaks....With the controller you can control how much breaks to apply.2) With the keyboard you can apply throttle....with the controller you can control how much throttle...3) Same is true with steering and leaning.

												Bought this last year and have tried it on various occasions, but now binned it and re-installed Moto13. Too many glitches, bad running (sometimes can't even get out of the game, and I've got newish running gear) and where on earth did Milestone get the bike sounds from? have they not actually gone to a motogp or superbike race. Started playing Motogp way back in the 2000s and I am sorry to say that since Milestone took over from THQ, the game has gone downhill, and is now floundering and is sometimes unplayable. Sad really because I am a big fan on Motogp.			",29,0,7,2,7,0,0

												First impression of the game. Its good, maybe even great. I love the menu, the character and customization, the motorhome, the pits and the ability to make and manage your racing team. The game seems crisp and fine tuned compared to the other MotoGP games. A few glitches and odd moments though, but overall if your after a good racing game with up to date racers and bikes, this game is your best option.			",25,2,4,3,10,1,12

Preliminary ReviewTL;DR: Works on AMD Radeon HD 6770m even though it doesn't meet the minimum system requirements. ... end of TL:DRIn briefMore polished presentation into career mode than MotoGP 14. I thought this would run smoother than 14 but it doesn't seem so. Maybe because the weather effects look more intense. It's still too early to be sure though. Not tried lowest supported resolution.  As always helmet or dashboard cam is a little tricky and scary around corners; i tried different cams thinking that one of these might give better fps. Bare bones nose cone cam may be needed to get better fps but view distance is severely shortened due to low height above ground.CorrectionIt's not nose cone but eye level with no rider or dasboard view so the view distance is similar.Keyboard handling is not a problem and maybe even easier than F1 series because auto-centering is not instantaneous. You could almost simulate a controller if you timed bike leans just right.... end of brief more later maybe.

			On keyboard, semi-pro physics, very easy AI. Radeon HD 6770m, i72630-QM. I went off track, tried rewind but made it worse. Didn't restart the race 'coz i just want to get this out ASAP.		

I would rate it 6/10. Get it if you want to create your own team; that's why i bought this. I want to see what are the design options. A minor negative which prevented this from 1 pt higher score is that there is no intro video or maybe there is?Update Jan 18, 2017 0751 hrsIf it seems too hard to control or win, try reducing the resolution and keep graphics niceties to a minimum.Update Jan 18, 2017 0943 hrsThere is a private team customization feature at the end of this replay. It gives you the option of creating your own team or go with the established teams. This is only the beginning so only 2 liveries are available and one is locked. Probably there will be more but i'm just guessing at this point.

												Another great motogp title, better physics than the predecessors from milestone including the SBK series and RIDE. If you enjoyed any of the other related titles you'll enjoy this aswell.The only thing that is lacking, is the rider customization. Everything is very generic looking, sure, theres a few colour alternatives but thats about it. Definitely recommended though!			",97,42,10,11,32,0,8

The AI seems to know you are on the track most of the time and not trying to drive right trough you.The AI is a bit to easy tho.The feel of the bikes are much improved as is the handling.All in all a big step up from MotoGP 14 and a love this game it is one of the best MotoGP games i have ever played and i have played lots of em.(Milestone are improving but they need to update there games more and not leave it after one patch.Come on Milestone start taking care of your games and your fans or you will lose us.)/Fart in the face			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The motorbikes are fun to drive, but the AI and the phisic of contacts/accidents are totally random. The flashback feature mitigate this, but not so much.

												I feel that im always doing the same review when we talk of the MotoGP series from Milestone, that could be true on the MGP15 regard if that wasnt the fact that now, you can create your own team/bikes, but overall feeling, i think this was a missed oportunity to create something really good and apart from the others.Let me explain, GP15 is still the best game of the series, better physics, graphics, sound and big improvement on the AI, and the possibility to run your own team, to me it fails on lack of customzation of your team bikes/driver, bc when you run with your team bike, in the middle of the others bikes, you loose the feeling that you are running a MotoGP bike, the lack of options, sponsors, stickers, make you bike look like a street bike in middle of racing ones.This is just a little detail, but if we look at Ride 2 (i know that its newer that 15), even pre-made custom bikes would had done a better job that only choosing stripes colors and 1 sponsor in racing bike, all that realistic feeling trow away, and sometimes if you look at those details, you are better running on team bikes bc they actually feel racing bikes.The overall package is good, and a big improvement over past games, lets hope they continue to improve the game and give us more options.

												I crashed too much in this game, need to get used to the physics (RIDE + GP13 mix). marquez; ""with 2014 bike, I create that slide. Now the problem is that the bike creates the slide, and I try to avoid it""in my case, in GP14 i create that slide/skid into the corner, but now GP15 bike creates that slide then i crash, loli still prefer GP14's physics, but yeah its a good game overall... pros :- better graphics, effects, so on. but color is kind of strange in shadow (assen starting grid), & in the rain- AA is back but not great, 8x AA the jaggies still present tho- more detail circuit, but Laser scan circuit on Project Cars & GRID/F1 is more acurate- wet race is more easier & fun- tyre wear is more forgiving than gp14 on 5 laps race distance (online race) didn't tried on 10/15laps yet- trading cards :Pcons :- its Milestone, we need Codesmaster to takeover MotoGP- no steamworks- MotoGP bikes strange corner crash (eg: Brno turn5 right handed, PI turn6 siberia..) Moto2/3 is fine- weird start > gear one, i just pull the throttle 100% (tcs off), the engine seems to cut the power instead of wheely? the start isnt challenging anymore- the transmission doesnt feel seamless, just like RIDE's production bike- crash on wrong place & still got penalty (i dont have any intention to take a shortcut, doh!!!)- 1.5gb vs 4gb texture, dont notice any diferentupdate :- if u hosting a lobby, randomly freeze during the race still present (since gp13-14), if this happen on the long straight is np, but if in the mid-corner its disaster, ur bike go straight into the wall/speedtrap gravel or high side crash instantly!! (u loose the battle with other rider or even the chance to fight for the victory/podium at least) not happen in every race but can happen 1-2 times in single race... - uh uh one more thing, my question just got answered by the recent event (Assen race)i'd been thinking for a long time if this stuff really happen in the real race, but hey it does!! Its kind of failed 'superman' freestyle trick on x-games then stupidly hanging off the side of the bike sooo clumsy & nothing u can do really (need to wobble 1st, but u know what i mean :P). Moto3 rider Niklas Ajo shows stunning commitment, crossing the finish line on his knees after a spectacular save.. Happen a lot to me tho since gp13, but after fantastic Ajo's happening, its a big relief (i thought milestone was trolling about this) fiuh...			",34,2,8,2,3,0,3

												Really wanted to like this game since I love MotoGP (all of the classes!)!- The engine sound is so bad.... like almost 8 bit engine sound bad- The way the motorcycle handles is also a jokeDon't buy, even if it's 99 cents!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is probably entertaining for some people into this genre but I find it being some sort of a ""follow a blue line"" simulator with bike physics. Not that fun. I suggest you look at the grid game series since they are pretty much the same (although with cars) and runs much better. 290x and I could barely run medium settings. I suggest you have crossfire/sli and a high end processor for maxed out settings at 1080p.			",33,4,4,5,4,0,1

												Im slightly disappointed, this was the 1st real game I got on steam and....well..I waited almost an hour for it to install THEN once it had downloaded fully I made my Racer ID or whatever it is, vailidated it and what not and I was all set to play! I had even connected my Windows Xbox controller to my Asus Gaming Computer. When I clicked play Steam did what it usually does, the screen goes black for a few seconds then the game loads in. Well in my case the screen went black for about 30 seconds then the game crashed. No warning. Nothing. I got the game on sell, it was only 10 dollars. But now I only have 6. I know my computer has all the qaulifactions that this game needed to run, i even rested my computer and to the largest extent I actully uninstalled the game altogether. Still nothing worked. Please if anyone could perhaps tell me how to fix this or anything but until now I have to give this a thumbs down. Im a huge racing fan expecially motor racing. Not to mention this looked like one of the best motor racing games I could come across thats not 80 dollars. Someone please help. Im pretty peeved.			",3,0,1,1,4,0,0

												Well this game could be so fun. And I do enjoy it, but playing with a gamepad or keyboard is almost impossible.  I need some settings for game pad to adjust dead zone as well as sensitivity.  Even if I partially push the stick left or right its all or nothing in steering.  This makes it very difficult to play with any kind of realism.   I know that won't ever be patched in so be mindful if you buy this game.  As far as graphics and gameplay though it is solid.

												My first and only MotoGP game was : MotoGP 11, and it was my only motorcycling game ever for that matter.I loved it. The driving experience, the way to surf in the turns, MotoGP really provides a unique sensation of driving.That sensation is still here in MotoGP 15. Great ! But, I remember in MotoGP 11 (on PS3) the very nice skies..., that is gone. No matter the sky condition you set (except for sunny) you end up with that boring exact same grey on cloudy, raining, lightly raining... no difference. No more of those beautiful sunbeams shining through the very nice big and scary clouds.The Bike and some aspects of the tracks may look better, but might be only due to higher resolution.Multiple bugs... from sound bugs, making you stuck with the ugly startup line's engines for the whole race, to the ones making it impossible to properly go back in time : if you fell, and want to rewind, you can, except that sometimes, you'll automaticaly fell back as soon as you reset it... and you are not able to rewind again after that of course.At the end of the day, I really enjoy MotoGP for the great driving and racing sensations, but it is in no way a game worth it's full price, it looks quite unfinished in some aspects. And I can't shake the idea that the 11 on PS3 gived a better visual experience than this one. Bying it at half price is a good compromise.			",47,17,4,4,10,1,2

												Crash and MotoGp can't be separated, Both in real life and in games. With MotoGP15 you can truly experience the adrenaline rush of seeing your unresponsive game freeze and crash. You are stuck and can't progress in this game.  Knowing your game is litterred with bugs, I just dont have the effort to go look for a solution.11/10 would crash again with MotoGP16.

This bike needs too much time to stop, different with auto brake on , i cannot doing hard brake that's just silly.			",97,28,8,9,10,1,8

												Update: I recently got Valentino Rossi (MotoGp 16) and It's a bit better than this I think.MotoGP 15 review:Just what I wanted from a MotoGP game.I've played a few in the past on PS3, and SBK09 on PC.I don't know about realism and hardcore sims when it comes to MOTOGP style games.Steering wheels work well with car games, but for a motorbike game, I'm not sure what would be 'required for realism'.So, my expectations for 'realism' in a motorbike game aren't very high - as long as the physics seem good and it runs smooth, with decent AI, I'm happy.That said, my Xbox controller works a treat for what it is.I can enjoy this game with full traction control on for an 'arcadey' experience, or ramp it up a bit for a more hardcore challenge.My first review of this game was negative (see below) because I had terrible jerking and stuttering graphics.I'm not sure how, but I redownloaded the game and it runs smoothly now.So now I can have fun like I used to on SBK09, but with a more up to date game.So it's all good.previous review:This game judders and jerks so badly it ruins what fun I might have had.Couple that with the pathetic sounds and you have yet another dissapointing Moto game.I'm glad it was on sale and I only wasted a few quid.I've tried various settings and tweaks to the config file, but to no avail.It stutters like a game from 1980.It's not my rig - I have a 970m SLI set up.Why was a game this poor over 18GB in size to download?The mind boggles.There is a fun game here somwhere, but I just can't enjoy with the crappy visuals and poor sound.I used to like Milestone, but if they keep bringing out garbage like this and can't even bother to optimise it for modern machines, they can kiss my behind.

												Im not exactly sure what to think really. Do I consider it fun... Yea, but only kind of! I remember the first MotoGP on the OG XBox being a lot more fun and in debth when it came to setting up your bike. I am not exactly sure what to say about this game exept that is an average racer. There is nothing exciting about it. Although the game is fun, it is a dull kind of fun if that makes any sense. There are sooo many things that you can do to this game to put it over the top to make it a one of a kind bike racer unlike any other! Everything about Moto GP 16 is just to freakin average. I haven't played any of this games predicessors other than the every first one and that was years ago. I do not need to play any of the older games in the series though... Me thinking that the very FIRST game in the line up is better than the 15th game in the line up says a lot. Don't even get me started on the custom logo gag. Yup... GAG! There are only a few ""custom"" pre-rendered logos to choose from and they are some of the lamest logos that I have ever seen! I have seen high school logos with better appeal... Even worse... I have seen little league logos that ot class the lame cartoony logos of Moto GP 16! Custom logos was a big selling point for me when I was considering to buy this game. I am a graphic designer and I was hoping to God that I would be able to upload my very own custom logos, but nope! I'll say it again, the logos pffered in this game are horrible... HORRIBLE!!! YUK!!! A cartoon shark... C'mon man... Really?I haven't gotten far enough into the game to really experience the ""custom"" livery selection yet, but I am afraid that if they are comparable to the logos I am in trouble! Moto GP 1 offered some extremely cool liveries for the bikes and the gear. All of which you could manipulate the color scheme any way you wanted. Not just one color of one part of the pattern, but every color of the pattern. Enabling you to create several million different color combinations! It was highly unlikely to see anyone with the same color scheme and pattern wehn you raced online... Everyones was different... All of the time!Online racing was also spot on in Moto GP 1. I haven't raced online with 15 yet, but I hope it is just as good. In 1 you could take your custom bile with your custom set up and race with it. If you are stuck racing a prefabed bike online I will be extremely dissapointed. If this is the case I will hang it up and put this game in the virtual garbage. So far, it looks as if the game is already on its way there... Lets hope not!			",83,13,3,6,10,1,0

												A good game overall if you like simulation. It's not for everyone since it's far from arcade, mainly the more realistic you go.Turning realism off will increase the arcadeness of the game but it will be a poor game by comparison.Graphics are good but not amazing.Sound is one of the best parts of the game.Career mode is fun but turns repetitive.Would recommend the game if you like MotoGP.11/10 - Because crashes			",432,118,25,42,59,6,70

												As expected the content is very similar to the previous games so a lengthy review is unecessary. I assume most people genuinly interested in this title would have played the previous games as well. However the game runs smoothly as I've had no game crashes and my framerate is fully stable on medium settings.Visually it looks good, I always race with a helmet cam so how pretty the trees are does not concern me. In terms of physics the game is more forgiving than MotoGP 14. In some respects I really miss the challenging physics of Milestone's early SBK games, however this is still challenging enough. It's a quality product.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm an FPS, RPG and Story driven games fan.Mechanics are awesome. Controls for someone who just got into this type of game is a bit difficult, but after you get use to it, it's a blast. Could have used a bit more animation scenes before/after the race and mre cosmetics for your racer, but it's good for what it has as well.Difficulty? Well, lets just say I was so happy that after a few hours of trying I started getting better at the game, and taking 1st places just to learn that the AI is set to Very Easy and I've been always playing with assist mechanic, meaning it automatically slowers my bick on corners and thucks for extra speed when I don't need to do any turns. In other words, the game is well worth the price and if you're a fan of racing games, then you'll most likely enjoy this one too.			",92,10,3,7,9,0,3
