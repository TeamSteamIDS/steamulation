My rating: ★★★★☆Moto Racer 4 (MR4) is a motorbike racing game featuring two categories: asphalt and dirt bikes. MR4 offers a career mode, split-screen and online multiplayer.ProsConsIntro, Menu, User InterfaceThe menu is simple, all settings are easy to find. The user interface during the race isn't crammed full of unnecessary details.The player is unable to change the language of the game, as it is based on the language of the OS. The intro is unskipable.ControlsThey work well with a controller.You really need a controller in order to play, otherwise you have a hard time.CareerThe career is easy for the first few cups. Later it gets harder and becomes a real challenge. Everytime you complete a cup you unlock a new rider, a freestyle trick or a new game mechanic for you to use, this serves the purpose to slowly introduce the player to new techniques.At times it can be frustrating, especially when you have to play multiple tracks in a row. E.g. if you get stuck or crash in one track, that race is basically lost and you lose the whole competition.Multiplayer-Online mode is dead. And if you manage to find a player you have to unnecessarily wait 60 seconds to start the race.GraphicsEnjoyable tracks, cool bikes, beautiful environment. Graphics are up to modern standards.The special effects (→ Turbos) are corny.MusicThe music is great and totally fits to this fast motorbike racing title!OtherYou can customize your bike with a huge palette of colours!For some reason they introduced characters in this game. Not saying that all these characters (and bikes) don't look cool, but they created a story around that, which appears childish.If you can look away from all the cons, you receive a great game for an affordable price!

												7,5/10 I don't really understand why everyone is bashing Moto Racer 4. Its actually a pretty neat game, fast-paced and incredibly fun ! AI is a challenging, and it takes quite a while to unlock everything, but tracks are amazingly built! Of course it's not as good as a Moto Racer 2, and there are some flaws, collision issues or gameplay choices that can be annoying (Who the hell decided that betting on your position before racing was a good idea??), but I'd definitely recommend MR4 if you're into arcade-racing games!

												Classic 90's styled racer, track design is great and reminds me of games such as cruis'n usa and obviously the original moto racer.i like the upgrade system and the ability to customise the bikes slightly.The racing itself is crazy the ai actually crashes into other vehicles sometimes which is cool but the difficulty is still high enough for a challengeThe optimization ist perfect yet, seems to have fps problems when running into walls, This seems to be the norm for early unreal 4 games. im sure with some patches it will be perfect.

												If u are looking for a arcade racing game that will put your adrenaline to the very limit stages !! THIS IS THE ONE !!Sequel to Moto Racer 3, who was a simulator, comes MR4, and the franchise here goes TOTALLY arcade, totally crazy, but with a high level of difficulty !! Swinging your 300km bike through traffic and tight corners never felt so adrenalized !!!Powered by Unreal Engine 4, the graphics are stunning, from the colors to the textures and the lightning + special effects, all is goodness for the retina of your eye !!I have to mention a special kudos to the tracks who are just so amazingly built, every track i though to push you to your very limit of sanity, Game is really like i said a adrenaline rush to your brain.I would easily say this is arcade racer of the year, Followed in the more simulation area by RIDE 2, from milestone.A Great 9/10 in my book !!! RECOMMENDED !!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I think this game is nearly perfect.  My only gripe is having to clear a 5 race championship (to move on)...that takes a long time!  I love arcade racers that force a player to do crazy jumps and ride against traffic -  things that you would never do in real life.   The menu is easy and very intuitive.  The graphics are beautiful.  The music is good.  The multiplayer is a blast.  Creating a championship is perfect.  I LOVED the other moto racers but ths one is fact becoming my favorite.  I am curious about the season pass (which I purchased)...so far, nothing more than a few new riders?Anyway, this is about as good as it gets for arcade style racing.  Just what I was looking for.

												Moto Racer 4 is back on track for good. I will do a quick evaluation PROs/CONsPRO:- Really fun on splitscreen- Easy to handle (it takes a few laps to really handle the joystick but after it's really easy to master it)- you can push your opponents out of tracks. In Splitscreen mod it's just awesome how your friend can be mad at you really quickly!- Good Carreer mode / Good difficulty level. You can choose yourself the difficulty. 1st race took me 30min before being able to beat the 3stars!! - IA is really tough sometimes so it's great because it's never easy. You've got to do the perfect race everytime. - Good number of tracks and Racers so far- HUD is simple. CON: - For now it's hard to find a party online. First time I was lucky I found it instanly. Now it much much longer. We need more people online guys! -> Invite your friend mode works well. - Can't add IA on multiplayer to fill the rank. Suggestion: - Replay mode to edit video would be great. - Being able to personalise the soundtracks. It's really an arcade game. I've seen people complaining about the graphics. I disagree with them as this game is not a simulation game. it's more focus on the fun and how easy it is to handle. And for that Moto Racer 4 is doing a good job.The only con would be that there are not enough players online.			",187,77,4,22,28,3,17

												If you are looking for something like the old Moto Racers that you can sink some real time in to I'd suggest trying Ride 2, the handling in this is far too vague for me to get anything out of it. A bit of a shame - it looks really cool and I was at least hoping for something along the lines of the original Burnout in the handling but there's no finesse to it.With enough assists and some grippy tyres you can have some good arcade-leaning fun in Ride 2, or switch off the assists for some extra depth if you want it!

												When I saw the trailers, I was expecting the worst to be honest. I know this game very well and the graphics being not so awesome, the bikes sounds being unrealistic, I was worried to have a bad game....but despite the down sides, it is actually pretty fun to play.If you are a fan of Moto Racer, you will enjoy the gameplay just like old times....the races are cool, various environment. It is a nice surprise.... have fun!			",114,28,6,13,12,1,27

												I like this game because it is challenging and difficult at times, the controls are tight but tricky to master, there is a good choice of custom options and unlockable riders and tracks, definatlely feels like a good arcade-y racing game from the past. Pick it up if you can.			",177,34,12,10,15,2,2

It's ok. Nothing special. The sense of speed is there, performance is good overall, but there's a noticeable framedrop/hitch when you hit a wall or drive through grass. Not always, but when it does happen it's quite jarring due to the sheer speed of the game. You can see it happen near the end of the video. Looks like a physics calculation performance issue. I saw others mention the same thing.It's pretty challenging and has decent variety. There's a career mode with progression, upgrades, unlockable characters and a betting system that allows you to predict your place in the upcoming race. For example, if you say you will finish first, but end up second, you don't unlock the next level, Or at least that's how I understood it in my brief testing. controls feel a bit clunky at first, so there is definitely a learning curve.Multiplayer is a ghost town on release day, so can't comment on that. Couldn't find a single game. There is split screen so if you are into local MP, might be a blast.Recommended for die hard fans of the genre at the current price, for everyone else, best wait for a sale.

												Probably one of the worse games played this year. DO NOT BUY!It is not on same level or even planet as original franchise. A bug ridden cash grab of a terribad game!  From the looks of it all the staff who made this have reviewed it themselves. See or yourself....

			In this video I was going to give a nice Gameplay video of me playing MotoRacer 4 for the first time. Problem after problem, the game gets worse...		

I will be getting a refund on this game as I would rather drink my own urine than even have this abortion show up in my Steam library!			",509,110,30,34,42,4,66
