												This is a really charming game, I only found this game because I won it during the Winter 2014 Auction, and i'm surprised that i've never seen it before because it's fantastic.I like the art style of the game, The game has quite a lot of attention to detail, such as a ""level select"" area where you can pilot a space shuttle and you can mess around with it for a few minutes and crash into space rocks.  I've only played through two levels so far but they've both been quite atmospheric as well and i love the underground areas as they feel like they add even more to the levels. I really like the physics of the game too as the physics add to the experience and add another element to the gameplay rather than how physics are incorporated into most games now, and just ""being there"" rather than actually adding anything to the game.So far it's quite simple and i'm not sure if it will manage to stay captivating for the entire game but right now i'm having a lot of fun with the game.Only had a quick play of this game so far but definitely looking forward to playing more.

												Worth every cent of the $0.21 I paid for it.Best game made with MS Paint ever.Okay, a more serious review.Beep has some good ideas, and with the recent sub-$1 sale it's was a good value, but this game was tossed out to customers before it was done.Game play concepts are good and the game is fun, but it starts too slow and the early levels are somewhat boring. Later levels get better, but it doesn't seem like this title was in development for a long time. It seems a little rushed.Every time something like a bomb explodes, I see black blocks on the screen where I suspect smoke would be, but instead I am getting some kind of graphical glitch.The user interface, especially the main menu and options, were slapped together at the last minute by an unpaid intern.Barriers and puzzles are unfortunately a bit weak. I was hoping for a better challenge.And finally, I think some players give up in the first few minutes to game play when they have trouble figuring out how to deploy for the first time. It took me a few minutes to figure out what I was supposed to do, and it was unnecessarily frustrating.Beep is kinda fun, but be sure to get it on sale. It's not a value at full price.

												Now THIS is a fun little platformer, adding little quirks to it that makes it just that little bit more unique.Now I'm not a big fan of platformers (except for the good old original mario games and a few rayman games) but I absolutely loved this one. I like how you can fly your ship around and choose where you want to do. Just everything about it feels fresh, like a whole new spin on how platforming games are made.You play as a robot with a variety of abilities, you can jump around, grab items, drag them around and do all sorts of things with them. You can even shoot if you want. But I like defeating enemies with gravity, it's amusing.It's hard to describe the game without showing it, so definitely check out video footage of the game and see if it's for you.If you're a fan of platformers, you won't be disappointed with this game. If you're like me and you're not too much of a fan, give it a go if you can get this on the cheap, I was pleasantly surprised and you may be too.I recommend this game.			",1095,265,59,122,171,5,161

												Considering how cheap this game is, I'd definitely say it's worth a go. The graphics (and art style in general, as well as some of the programming) seem to be pretty sloppy at times, but it has a unique charm to it! The level design is consistently ""pretty good,"" with occasional memorable moments.You play as a BEEP robot, exploring a system to collect antimatter. Gameplay consists of mostly platforming puzzles utilizing moving, jumping, shooting, and, more often than not, the Zero Point Energy Field manipulator (read: gravity gun) which you control with the right mouse button. The game takes place in an unnamed star system with three planets. Each of the two hemispheres on each planet has its own environments, music, and introduces one or two game mechanics that for the most part are used exclusively for that hemisphere. Each hemisphere has 4 levels, which each have 3 anti-matter nuggets to find, as well as a bonus fourth one which is rewarded upon collecting ~20 smaller pellets scattered around the level. This leaves 96 antimatter parts to collect. In order to unlock the next hemisphere, you must find a minimum amount of antimatter nuggets in the previous levels, as well as getting to the end of all the previous levels.While this game is certainly charming, it's not without its flaws. It is very possible to use the antimatter to grab an item and use it to propel yourself upwards before grabbing it and using it again, and, if you're good enough at it, can be used to get over almost any obstacle. While the game never requires you to do this, it is tempting to do it to get just a little more air to climb a wall. On quite a few walls, it is possible to simply drive straight up them by moving towards them, as one of BEEP's wheels seems to clip into the wall. The difficulty curve is somewhat predictable up until the last planet, where both hemispheres present environmental hazards that make the game much more difficult (though not frustratingly so). Completing levels honestly felt a little unrewarding, and I was consistently able to 100% complete levels my first time visiting, never having to backtrack. Additionally, there is no reward for collecting all 96 nuggets of anti-matter. This may be an issue for people who invest more time to collect everything. I managed to beat the game and collect everything without backtracking in under 4 hours.As a snobby musician, I thought the music was pretty forgettable, However, it had themes that appeared multiple times in the game, which is always interesting to discover, and the music never feels out of place. The art style feels very much like that of a decent flash game, using basic shapes and characters with cartoony eyes and solid colors. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it feels hastily done to me.At the time that I'm writing this, it's on sale for $0.49. I can definitely recommend it at that price, at least. It's a cute little game, but don't expect hardcore gameplay or mindblowing game design.			",115,27,4,10,13,1,7

												Beep is a sweet casual side-scrolling platformer. Would I tried to dismantle it, I'd saw the pieces of many other good games: World of Goo, Mario, StuntMania, with the addition of gravity beam from Half Life 2... whatever. Really I don't want do dig that deep.You've got a rocket, you fly from planet to planet, to disembark a little robot there, which then goes from the left part of the screen to the right side, jumping, climbing, diving, shooting the bad robots, and moving objects with the gravity force... As easy as it sounds, after some time given, the puzzles getting more and more complex and challenging.As of downsides, I really can think only of one. It is cartoon-styled and not-that-much-rewarding. Obviously, I'm a bit too old for this type of gameplay, but I'll easily pass Beep to my kids.My mark is 7.1/10. Not the brightest star on the sky of game design, but the one made clear and thorough. Well-fit for little casual play sessions.			",725,237,45,155,101,5,232

Product received for free
Basic InformationTitle:  BEEPDeveloper:  Big Fat AlienPublisher:  Sunken Treasure Games, Big Fat AlienGenre:  Physics-based platformerGeneral ImpressionBEEP is a 2D platformer that features some very interesting physics-based gameplay mechanics via a gravity gun of sorts. The art style and stage diversity have made a good impression upon myself, since I’m already used to so many bland platfoming games out there. BEEP stands out from the crowd with the use of clever mechanics and pleasant 2D graphics. It contains a decent number of puzzles that encourage different approaches. The sounds are also without major complaint and the game’s only flaws remain the bane of many similar platformers: relative short experience and no multiplayer support.Strong Points+ Interesting gameplay and level design.+ Steam Trading Cards.Weak Points- Short experience even if there is some replay value.- No Steam Achievements.Rating 7/10 This review was submitted for SUPER Giveaways.

												5.1/10 - Platformer: Disney's Wall-E with a Grav Gun!I was fonder of playing this platformer than I thought; maybe it's that I have played so many bad ones... but this one delivered for the most part. The typical platformer template is combined with beautiful graphics and some unique gameplay. You mostly rely on your propulsion rockets and a gravity gun that can help you achieve your objectives. Platformers can be difficult in general; and this one will cause you to struggle, but this game is more on the enjoyable and achievable side of things. There is quite a bit of content and plethora of maps to explore for the meager price of $2; caution though this game can be found on sale more often than not!Worth the $2; I'd only pay $0.50 though since it's always on sale for that!

												I played this with my son, so I may have a bias here.  This is a simple platforming action game.  You are a robot in search of gold in different worlds.  Your robot can fly temporarily and you must go through a few different worlds ranging from ice worlds, to desert worlds.  The game doesn't necessarily stand out, however the tight controls and the cartonny graphics and animation make it a good play for young children.  Definitely gets a thumbs up for its accessibility for my son.			",1327,517,57,145,105,15,209

												BEEP is very well balanced and just plain fun to play. You know these games where you feel the dedication of the developers? BEEP is just that! Instead of playing clones and remakes of old 2D platformers why not play a modern game that brings new things to the table? Well, i wouldn't say BEEP is very innovative with it's features but it feels polished from the beginning and will surprise you here and there. For some reason, it's easy to fall in love with this game.""BEEP"" is a simple but interesting game with some cute graphics and good physics and awesome music. Nice example of how to create an indie game without being pretentious. Nothing less, nothing more.			",154,36,8,10,11,0,15

												A fun little platformer. Took me a little over 6 hours to complete the whole game and I'm usually not very good at these games. The later levels were quite challenging.Aside from some graphics glitches (black boxes sometimes randomly appear when you kill an enemy) this game was a lot of fun. Too bad certain game elements were restricted to specific worlds, like flying and grappling. Some sort of Expert levels with all of these elements at your disposal, mixed with hordes of enemies, would have made a great and more challenging addition.Well worth the price tag, but I reckon most of it will be too easy for fans of the platformer genre.

												You know what? This is a good game. I didn't really expect to like it...I'm not much of a platformer guy, and I originally only had a license because I bought a bundle. But the graphics were interesting enough in a oddly appealing way, and it looked as if it wasn't just constant Mario moments with a bunch of hidden crap that you had to memorize, so I decided to add it to my library instead of trading or gifting it. And man, am I glad that I did.What I got was a thinking man's platformer that includes some really interesting mechanics (especially the many variable ways that your gravity beam can be applied). As the environments change, so do many of the challenges for those levels, so the environments aren't merely eye candy. Everything was achieveable, even if getting to 100% completion on some levels required some pretty diabolical thinking.The controls are tight, graphics are original, and gameplay is solid. I ended up playing every level, and hanging in there to the very end (many platformers make me rage quit 20% of the way through the game, and I have enough other stuff in my library to play that I will often just dump the platform game to play a FPS/RPG/adventure game, which are my primary genres).The only downside to this game? You're left with a bit of a cliffhanger at the end -- an obvious set-up for the next game -- but, to the best of my knowledge, no sequel was ever produced (this game was released in 2011, so it doesn't seem very likely that will ever happen). That's too bad, because I would gladly pay to play the sequel as well.At two bucks, if you like platformers at all, you'd be kind of dumb to pass this one up. This is a really solid game from an independent developer, and I'm happy to hand him my $2 all day long. Great game, Big Fat Alien, and I hope that you decide to follow up BEEP  some day with a sequel. I'd pre-order just to support you. Nice work.			",592,324,27,32,26,5,35

												I bought this game, laugh and tears, looking for a reason to live. I then proceeded to download the 2 mb of joy this gem has, and clicked install. At first, I was astonished, stunned in front of such graphics. I was in the main menu, in the space shuttle. I bought this game expecting nothing, but it was so big. I have no further need to buy No Man's Sky, this game has it all. Alien tractor poop with physics of gamemaker 2003, I still don't know how I could be more amazed by such a game in the next years. This game has revolutionized the industry of gaming, and renamed the whole concept of fun. As an ex-Christian, I have to admit I changed my religion, to BEEP. This living creature gives me chill everytime I open it. It's a tunnel of fun which leads to confidence and creativity. Before BEEP, my life had no meaning and sense, but I now follow the true life that other people would be jealous of. I often post screenshots of BEEP on my facebook page, but it seems like no one else likes BEEP as much as I do, which is why I think it is the greatest spiritual presence I could follow.If you are reading this, I am truely greateful for you, because your life can get meaning with the simple ''Add to cart'' button. This game is a masterpiece, and I will forever be happy that BIG FAT ALIEN released this incredible pearl.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got BEEP in a puzzle-related game bundle so hard to assess the value vs fair price for me. However, I think I got what I paid for. I love a good platform puzzle game and while BEEP is such a game, I only like it. To start, I had to play in windows-mode only (alt-enter to exit fullscreen) because the fullscreen mode would not cooperate. I spent a good amount of time trying to make it work in fullscreen that I should've just played it in windows-mode the whole time. The graphics are indeed nothing to boast, but cute to a degree. The micro-expressions the beep does when underfire, firing, jumping/etc is amusing (if noted during gameplay). You are given a mini-background story as to why the BEEPs exist and then you appear in a galactic map. It isn't clear where you supposed to go as I ended up flying the ship around the 'galaxy' wondering what to do. It's also funny to me how the ship comes to an abrupt stop when you stop clicking a direction for it to fly to (unrealistic, but in a game were Wall-E's cousin has a better job than him, it doesn't matter).  While the design is fairly easy (WASD/Arrow in combination with the mouse),  the game can be both unforgiving and lenient. If you over-jump even a slightly bit, you are most likely falling to your death. However, if you are jumping and your wheels are able to touch a surface (along the side of the walls or where-ever), you are allowed another chance to jump again to make it (granted, you have to be pretty quick with your reactions to do so). The goal to collect the anti-matter and little gems (25) to get another anti-matter makes it more than just a puzzle platform. Especially so since you do need to collect them to progress the game. Some of the puzzles are very simplistic at the beginning and I believe it'll be so throughout the game since there isn't much combination the game can do with the gravity gun besides just moving the objects around freely/around a pivot piece. Overall, it's a decent game and if you get it in a bundle or stand-alone, you will have some fun time with it. Not a game to finish immediately, but I suggest on the side. 7.5/10.

												If you combine platforming from the Mario games, and mix it with the half-life gravity gun and physics, you have BEEP.BEEP is a colorful game about physics and platforming.Pros:Colorful and bright graphics.Amazing puzzles and physics.Picking up random crap and throwing it to kill enemies is the funniest thing ever.Many different levels and worlds, each with their own enviroment.Cons:The physics  can be broken very easily.Not a very good storyline.A few bugs I've ran into, but not very many.There should be a 1-2 second delay between reloading your gun.I would recommend buying this game on a sale  (I got it for around 0.20$ on a sale) because the game goes on sale often.Now, for the rating: I'm giving this game a recommended 6.0 rating, but that's just my personal opinion. I love these types of platformer games, so if you don't like platformers, don't take this rating to heart.Anyway, that's my review.I'm out.          ~Darkel ",92,24,4,2,4,1,3

												Very good!Genuinely puzzling yet fun levels, at least 4 hours of gameplay. Remarkable physics for an indie game, though totally exploitable to glitch through some of the obstabcles, though that part just adds fun.I would buy this even if it costed more.The graphics are a bit cartoon-ish, more appealing to children, but that's fine.The only downside is - I could not find a settings menu, so I guess you can't change controls and volume.10/10			",71,11,2,0,5,0,9

												BEEP is a simple physics based puzzle platformer. No controller support that I could detect, but the WASD keyboard and mouse controls provide a good degree of control and feel right. You maneuver a little robot that is equipped with a cannon and a tractor beam which allows you to shoot enemies and manipulate objects in the environment in an effort to collect energy crystals. The game also has some fitting sound effects and music for the game's theme. Kind of average--nothing that hasn't been done before.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												It's a game where you play a little robot who I imagined is the love child of Wall-e and Eve. The game has puzzles that range from easy to agonizingly easy. It did however play on my love of throwing crap at other crap. If you are going to play it I recommend playing it carelessly (John Rambo style) otherwise there is no challenge, except for the last level which the horrible swinging physics will kill you. There's a hint that there will be a sequel, so hopefully they will ramp up the difficulty and give us a proper ending. Alright, could've been better.			",93,40,0,2,8,1,13

												BEEP is the first title out of BigFatAlien, and judging from the quality of this litle gem, BFA is someone to watch.The core gameplay is always accessible. It is a physics enabled 2D platformer that harkens back to the days of Super Mario and the ilk. It feaures a nice overworld to let you choose levels, and has a simplicity about it that is charming.The BEEP itself is a darned cute character that certainly has my vote for President when he decides to run.Music is top notch, sound design is great, and visuals are styled well and look awesome.Easily worth the money.

												I loved playing it, unfortunately due to a mistake of steam it got refunded.It's great for any platform gamer, it's got this magnety carry system with which you can carry your enemies corpses and throw them into pits or into other enemies.But on to steam's mistakes.I bought the bundle of bundles with beep in it, but one of the games was crap and it said if I would refund that game it would also take down a marble game and a ball shooting game and I would get 4 cents.I was fine with that.But them steam without a warning refunded the whole collection and took beep away from me. unfortunately the bundle is also gone from the sales so I can't get the games that I did want all back together.I guess I'll have to wait to the next sale :( Steam isn't being helpful supportwise either.Never in the entire process of refunding did it mention it would take down the other three bundles in the bundle of bundles. I have now lost a game I loved dearly due to their miscommunication.			",55,17,1,4,28,0,14

Product received for free
												To be honest, for a five hours to complete game its not that bad for a 2$ game, or 50 cents if you get this on sale.Unfortunately, the description is kind of a lie.I was not thinking at all about Yoshi's Island while playing this, granted there might be some similarities due to it being a 2D platformer, and the fact that you have to go through all the levels of the game.The reason is because yoshi's Island was at best a platformer to anything else, and was loved by gamers because of its classic artstyle and the challenge that was always looming around.Also, there were boss stages, which unlike in this game, where while it seemed to have built up to a boss it actually wasn't, and it just add more to how there is a lack of any tension to your journey.Really you're just strolling about and at best nobody would ever need to even check a walkthrough because the game is too simple with how you collect items, as secrets are pretty obvious.That being said I'll give to the devs credit that the physics are definetly impressive and at times I was  genuinely impressed with the possiblities they made with them. Sadly, the said potential is kind of locked for the current stage, and the mechanics are different for each of the four stages, basically giving you something new to work with only to be quickly abandoned. It's quite pointless if you ask me.As for the ""hardcore"", the only part that was a challenge was the last stage, only because there are no checkpoints where it feels like there should be, and I'm pretty sure its where you'd probably quit the game by that point, especially since up to this point the game was fair enough in its challenge, only to bombard you with tiny careful jumps along with deadly fall right at the end.In addition, the only other difficult part is that sometimes puzzles become unbeatable because you might end up accidently throwing the blocks you essentialy need out of your reach, which I feel like they haven't thought it through, and it shows.That being said, the story is not entirely bad (but sure as heck disappointing)  and the graphics are fairly decent for an indie game...Too bad the game already crashed to me once (I think) and at some points did in fact got some major lag for such a minium req. game, and my PC isn't even high-end at best but can still run much bigger games which is why I assume the lag is on the dev's end, plus whenever a  certain enemy explodes it seems to almost tear space and time as it glitches into black boxes everywhere...But hey, if you want to waste 5 hours and dont mind wasting less than a dollar on sale go for it, although if you want to at least seem like you have a decent library of games on your steam account, then you should probably skip this, it's not really worth it.On a quick note I checked one of the dev's blog. If you absolutely hate clifhangers then yeah stay away from this game. These guys ain't making a sequel, and sure as heck don't deserve any positive review just for that.			",90,6,0,20,2,0,3

												This game is actually quite good! Whenever it goes on sale for dirt cheap (pennies to a nickle I mean) then give this one a chance. All around it took me about 3-4 hours to complete. Overall there are some fun and interesting physics puzzles that require a good grasp of platforming. It's all cheap, clean, and has a really nice challenge to it at the end of the day.

												Very fun and calming game to play. The physics are amazing while the plateforming mixes perfectly with the physics and combat. I recomend this game to any type of gamers because it really does capture almost all types of gameplay in one amazing game.Pros-Includes trading cards-Puzzles mixed with physics and plateforming make it a superior game with combat-Can run on a wired potatoe-Small price for a large and amazing game-A good game to play offline in like a airplane ect.Cons-MultiplayerI would really like to see a multiplayer version of this either its just playing the levels with a companion or its a death match I would really like to see it-Level editorSame as multiplayer I would really like to see this in the game and you could download other peoples stages off the workshopBut anyways, with or without multiplayer and/or level editor I strongly recommend this game to any type of gamer.

												BEEP is just not vey interesting and feels very much like a flash game. I didn't find it too bad at first considering the 19 cents I paid, but after an hour or so I was already bored. The gravity gun is not very fun to use and a lot of the game seems to be just stacking stuff so that you can get up. I wouldn't compare it to Yoshi's Island at all.The most annoyng thing about this game is the very robot you play as. It babbles and screeches in a high, annoying voice, and you get to hear gems like ""♥♥♥♥ you"" over and over again when you shoot enemies. But unlike some reviews claim you can disable the sounds and music.			",47,18,0,12,12,0,2

												Overall: BEEP is a cute little puzzle platformer that I'm sure can run on even the most rotten of potatoes, and while you maybe run into technical issues with monitors or odd frame dips. if you don't run into any of the previous stated issues, this game seems great for kids.Platformer: BEEP as a puzzle platformer is decent, from what I played, it's nothing too challanging, but I'm sure it gets more difficult as you go from world to world as stated by other reviews.Performance: BEEP despite seeming simple does not come without its flaws, technical issues haunt this game like odd frame dips, holding around the 30's, to monitors issues like the game going to stretched full screen with multi-monitor setups. I'm not saying you will for sure run into these issues, nor am I saying there are not solutions to them, just know before buying, you are not safe from them.Appeal: While I can not say to a grown adult ""hey, go buy this game"", I can say this game is great for kids with the simple, ultra cute art style, easy controls and low spec requirements.

												I didn't expect to like this game. The graphics looked too simplistic, and I mistook it for a half-baked effort. It isn't.If you've ever liked platform games that ask you to stop and think up your movement beforehand rather than have lightning reflexes, you are probably going to like this game. It is a light-hearted puzzle platformer,There is not much frustration to be had, at least up until the part I've reached so far. You casually bounce around platforms, collecting thingies and shooting badies. When they either kill you, or you fall to your death, you respawn on one of the rather frequent checkpoints. You have infinite lives as far as I can discern, so no pressure there either.I've said that on the review of another game too: I'm in a phase in my life that sometimes I just need to squeeze a stress ball to unwind from my day, I need my off time to be relaxing, not stressful. Taking gaming way too seriously is in the past for me. This game suits me just fine. It's one of the anti-stress squeeze balls of gaming. If this sounds like something you'd like, give it a try.

I'm not saying you will for sure run into these issues, nor am I saying there are not solutions to them, just know before buying, you are not safe from them.Appeal: While I can not say to a grown adult ""hey, go buy this game"", I can say this game is great for kids with the simple, ultra cute art style, easy controls and low spec requirements.

												It's an ok game. I bought it for 15p so I can't say I was expecting the world. It has trading cards which is pretty nice for the price I bought it at. The game feels decent, it feels slightly like one of those free flash games you'd find on the internet though but generally it's a nice experience that I'm sure many enjoy. If it's onsale for a price similar to what I bought it at, get it. I don't think I would buy it for 3.99 though.			",24,3,0,0,4,0,2

												BEEP is a game that pleasantly surprised me. I wasn't exactly sure what to expect with a $0.19 price tag, but this game really managed to grab my attention. Essentially you're contolling an endless fleet of robots that are exploring various planets and searching for ""matter"". At your disposal you have a gravity gun that allows you to manipulate objects as well as a machine gun for dealing with enemies and traps. In addition, you may find other tools to use on each planet, such as a rocket fueling pad that allows you to fly. Here are my overall thoughts:Pros:-It controls very well for the most part. The gravity gun can have a few hiccups at times, but otherwise the game functions as intended.-The enemies and other obsticles give the game a bit of challenge, although the game is very forgiving with checkpoints, infinite lives, and no loss of collectibles upon death at the same time.-The puzzles that this game presents allow the player to be somewhat creative by allowing them to manipulate a majority of objects in the environment.Cons:-The art style is very simple and not extremely detailed. The game's environments are, for the most part, plain.-The music is not very memorable.-Enemy placement forces the game to be played very slowly, but the game's forgiving nature provides no sense of urgency. Essentially this makes the game feel very slow at some points.Overall, I would say that BEEP is definitely a good game for casual play. It can be rather relaxing, in fact. While it is rather simplistic and minimalistic, that adds a certain charm to its overall presentation, in my opinion. I would definitely recommend it at its sale price, although at full price I'm on the fence.			",63,15,0,7,2,0,10

												Got it with Developer Alliance Bundle for something like 0.99 $ on summer sale. Died about 100 times and got about 13 hours of gameplay on completion (ok i suck at it). + The controls are tight (keyboard + mouse combination) and platforming action is decent. + Physics is unassailable. You could try all kinds of weird stuff in game without the engine complaining or acting out.+ Initially the gameplay seemed too easy, but eventually the difficulty ramps up(especially towards the end). Challenges are not very hard though.+ There may be more than one way to get past an obstacle.+ Enemies are nice, and each have their own unique strengths, quirks, and weakness, which is not immediately apparent. It may be a while before you figure out how to kill an enemy. Again several approaches are possible. + Some twist  or break in gameplay on different levels, maybe a new weapon, power,  enemy, new kind of environmental  hazard. Doesn't get monotonous.+ Music is ok. I liked the weird arab/oriental/fusion track in the ice planet.- Graphics are meh. Simple, cartoony, flash-like. I don't mind those things. Its not poorly done or anything like that but overall it doesn't come together to build a suitable feel or atmosphere. Each planet (of which there are 3) has it's own climate/environment. The last planet is the better of the three. The world, ominous music, come together nicely to give good atmosphere. The creepy firebreathing monster in that planet is a nice touch.- No real story or setting. This could have made the game more interesting or provided reward for progression.Overall. This puzzle platformer was competant if forgetable. Passing a stage while collecting all the lums - or whatever it is we are supposed to collect- is a good way to while away 10-15 minutes. Definitely worth the price and not unworthy of your time either. Get it if it comes on sale.			",166,59,5,18,16,1,12

												A fun physics puzzle / exploration platformer. I am enjoying this quite a bit. Some of the puzzles are challenging, but so far most are extremely easy to solve. I hope they increase the difficulty a bit once I land on other planets. The desert definitely ramped up the difficulty. One cool thing to me was it was written in SFML using Box2D and some other stuff, which I hadn't seen very often. Definitely a cute, fun, casual game I'll hopefully beat some day.+ Cute graphics / story+ Very fluid and simple controls+ Beautiful example of Box2D physics- Kind of easy so far			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a fairly charming and playable platforming and puzzle game, with a satisfying difficulty curve and a decent variety of puzzles. The controls are simple to master and the platforming is mostly forgiving, due to Beep's high degree of mid-air manoeuvrability and tendency to stick to platforms with its treads. Deaths were infrequent and usually fair, so frustration never really crept in.There are often a number of ways to deal with enemies and solve puzzles, mostly due to the games somewhat wonky but effective physics engine and the gravity gun. This tool allows you to sling objects (and enemies) all over the place and is the basis for most of the puzzles.Ultimately, its not the most polished game you will find, but its a steal for $2 and I enjoyed it to the end.

												I recently bought this game to keep my steam market alive and have come to the realisation that it is not halfway bad!When you start the game you get a neat introduction and you start right off by choosing the levels.I discovered that each level carries their own little challenges and there are usually more than one way of soving them.The physics aspect of the game is nice. Simply a game to cool down after a stressful day or game.Overall the game is highly playable, for the low price of 0.99 € (0.49 € sale in my case) you get to play a neat little game which, in it's own right, gives you a lot of playtime and enriches your steam library with yet another game.I haven't encountered a glitch or bug yet.

												In this game you’ll control the eponymous Beep bot in search for energy blobs around the galaxy, a simple setup for a platform game. While you might take this as a small budget indie game, this is actually much better polished than any flash game you’ll find flooding the net. The animation is smooth and the stages are smartly designed, not only will you find it a challenge to complete each stage perfectly, you’ll have to devise your own strategies in doing so as well.The protagonist is essentially a clone of Wall-E given Gordon’s gravity gun, but the mechanics used is perhaps the most innovative aspect of the entire game. You’ll use rocks to block incoming projectiles and you’ll use your enemies’ miniature carcasses to activate switches. When all else fails, you can always jet pack your way out while gunning down bots with your machine gun; like a boss.Another twist came from Beep’s partial immortality, since the mothership can churn out any number of bots as it wished and beam it down to the last checkpoint. Beep is by and large, expendable. This means you can be free to explore the stages as you wish, completing areas via some bizarre manners manipulating the physics engine.If you can’t tell by now I’m totally recommending this game, with its low price tag and the aforementioned features, there is no reason why you shouldn’t give this a chance.

												BEEP is a decent indie platformer with an interesting physics engine. Use your cannon, gravity gun and a number of other tools to defeat enemies, solve puzzles and unlock new areas.The graphics are vibrant and the music is quite good. The level design requires the player to come up with different approaches to solving puzzles.For the negatives, the game is quite short with little replay value. And while it offers Steam Trading Cards, it lacks Steam Achievements.Overall, I'd recommend BEEP mainly to platformer enthusiasts who are looking for a new challenge.			",45,14,0,9,3,0,3

												An exellent casual side scrolling platformer that is one massive homage to all platformers before it. Fun to play and cheap too. Has very fun and challenging puzzles and gameplay. If the nostalgic premise doesn't pull you in, the beautiful art style will.			",39,5,0,5,12,0,0

												I have been playing this game for a little while now and I would have to say it's worth purchasing.  If you are into platforming games I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy this.  Especially with the current sale going on it's definitely a good game to add to your library.			",1112,411,47,67,97,11,72

												So, before you start thinking ""cheap game like this couldn't get any better"", hear me out. There are a couple reasons why you should buy this game:1) this game is cheap, it's guarantee 100% boring, BUT, game like this is suit for your lil brothers/ sister or your son to play. Great isn't it?2) Earn budget by selling trading cards, I bought this game with 0.10$, I sold the trading cards for 0.60$, worth buying.3) Level up achievement by collecting games, so this is one of the cheapest game you can get and use it to level up your badge, worth it.So yeah, with this cheap game you can get so much profits, buy it now before it's too late. :)			",55,1,0,3,1,0,2

												If there is one word that I would use to describe this game, it would be adorable. Everything about this game is adorable. The world design, the level selection, the characters, the hints, even the death screen. Also, this game has the most satisfying mechanic of picking up your fallen enemies and doing as you please. Wheather that be throwing them away or stacking them up to get to higher places, the gravity gun is one of the most genius things ever and it works so smoothly. The platforms are super fun to jump onto and move around with the gravity gun and the world is just overall fun to move around despite being linear. There is so much detail in this game that dirt specs fly when you ride over grass, but they aren't at all distracting. I love this game so much, and if you do not have it yet, get it. Now.

												Side scrolling & Rage inducing, two of the most addictive things about games today.It has several planets, each planet containing different levels. In the game you play as BEEP, BEEP is a small robot which has a Zero Point Energy Manipulator and a cannonball launcher, you are up against several different enemies, these include; a Robot, Zappy fish, Allhau Akbar robot, and many more! There are several types of levels including; Desert Levels, grassland Levels, Ice Levels and Lava Levels! Flying through space in your little rocket ship, choosing from the levels, gradually getting more and more difficult, enemies aim getting better and a less defined goal. The soundtrack belonging to this game is also calming, it is space age music, but relaxing.As if 2001: A space oddesy & Wall:E had a child, this would be it! This is a great game for children aged 7-11, I give it a 6.5/10			",78,13,0,10,10,0,3

												BEEP is a good little platformer that would be awesome if it had controller support. It also lacks a menu, meaning no settings of any kind. These 2 things really keep BEEP from being a great platformer. Platformers are meant to be played with a controller, imo and  settings(windowed mode, sound) are nice options to have too. As is 5/10, would be 8/10 if it was complete.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The biggest problem with this game is that it's unpolished. The main feature, the physics beam, is awkward to control, and it lets go at the most inconvinient times. The art is inconsistent and underwhelming. I'm not sure, but I think I could have done most of the art assets in MS Paint. And the semi-realistic gold nugget looking things are supposed to be antimatter? Please, just do a Google search and find a better asset. The same few enemies and bits of terrain are also resued over and over, which results in a boring, static experience. There is very little challenge and no penalty for failure. If you die, the only thing you lose is time off your life as you respawn at the latest checkpoint with no golden antimatter nuggets missing and the enemies respawned.This obviously makes it very easily to cheese some antigold nuggets by suicide-jumping them. The reload feature is instant - just press ""R"" - and you never stop shooting. It may as well not be there at all for how much it impacts gameplay. There are some good bits, of course, but not enough to justify the full $5 price. Honestly, I've seen better games written in Flash for my browser.			",50,17,0,11,10,0,10

												I do recommend this game, but play it at your own risk. It's ♥♥♥♥ing impossible. The third level from World 6 is the hardest level from a video game I have ever played (I know World 6 is the last world meaning that level is technically the second last level, but still). And yes, that includes COCKING DARK SOULS AND HOTLINE MIAMI!If I gave this game a difficulty score between 1-10, this game would be 12. DS would be 11 and HM would be 10.Even world 2 was stupidly hard.			",151,12,2,1,6,0,5

												This is a 2-D physics, puzzles, shooter and platformer.BEEP is a Wall-E like robot kind that have a gun and a gravity like gun. You need to stack, pull and grab your way across three plantets with two sides to them each. Fight the KREEP and find out what is going on. This is a 2-D platformer with puzzle and some shooting. You can throw your enemys at other enemys to kill them and some need more then your gun. Reload with E, This game is without voice acting and platforms will deliver the story. This is a shortish cute game that is kinda low priced but if you fancy yourself a puzzler or want to get into it then this might be an easy entry path. For all ages, no blood. You got 8 hp, if you die another BEEP will take your place at the checkpoint. Even I managed to complete it 100 %. No achievements but you can complete it but there is no completon bonus. I hope you found this helpful.Have fun, enjoy and BEEP them all :)			",101,41,0,14,6,1,6

												This is a 2-D physics, puzzles, shooter and platformer.BEEP is a Wall-E like robot kind that have a gun and a gravity like gun. You need to stack, pull and grab your way across three plantets with two sides to them each. Fight the KREEP and find out what is going on. This is a 2-D platformer with puzzle and some shooting. You can throw your enemys at other enemys to kill them and some need more then your gun. Reload with E, This game is without voice acting and platforms will deliver the story. This is a shortish cute game that is kinda low priced but if you fancy yourself a puzzler or want to get into it then this might be an easy entry path. For all ages, no blood. You got 8 hp, if you die another BEEP will take your place at the checkpoint. Even I managed to complete it 100 %. No achievements but you can complete it but there is no completon bonus. I hope you found this helpful.Have fun, enjoy and BEEP them all :)			",101,41,0,14,6,1,6

												BEEP is a puzzle game where you solve puzzles with a gravity gun and kill a bunch of evil robot thingys which are... being evil in the star system your BEEP-Ship has discovered. Your BEEPs must explore 2 very different zones across the each 3 planets in the system collecting anti-matter along the way. Each zone is 4 levels long and each level and zone increases in difficulty. Each level has 3 chunks  and 25 nuggets of anti-matter. Collecting all 25 nuggets will award you a fourth chunk. Anti-matter allows you to unlock new zones providing you've completed all the levels in the previous zone. You will traverse methane oceans, volcanic valleys, a purple forest and death, so much death. You can get a total of 96 chunks of anti-matter although you only need 60 to unlock the final zone. At the end it's hinted there may be a sequel!Paragraphs? What are those?Rating: 9/10 because I get angry when I die.			",116,31,4,15,24,0,26

It's boring, save your money - even if BEEP were free, it wouldn't be worth your time.BEEP feels like someone's first learning project in a game engine. The story is pointless, the mechanics are boring, the gameplay is too simple, and the art is bad. For example, BEEP can fire bullets at enemies and obstacles - that's cool, but what is the point in having an option to reload if you have infinite ammo anyway?If this was a mobile game, my review would be different. BEEP is okay for throwing a few minutes into here and there, but as a computer game, entertainment feels forced and I quickly lost interest.			",212,71,2,51,39,2,51

												A cool platformer with some puzzle elements. It controls well for most of the time, has a good progression through 24 levels divided into 6 ""worlds"", and it's fun to play. It's not difficult, although some parts can be a bit frustrating. But most collectibles are mandatory, so they feel a little pointless. They should be just collectables to unlock extra stuff. But what's here is worth 5-6 hours of good content. Some achievements would also be appreciated.			",267,164,6,30,13,4,38

												BEEP, is a funny Plattformer, Puzzle and Brain game.It´s was fun playing it even if i do not personally like that Art of game. (i´m a Fast Paced Action lover)Still BEEP was so far one of rare games that i would play some hour´s (until i get frustrated because i somehow being very bad on such games)It doesnt really has Story. It´s more like short explains about BEEP´s Skills in the levels (There are those ""info plattform"")Controls were good i do not had any problem´s with my Mouse and keyboard playing it!Graphics are good. Emeny´s make you think about how to get not killed or get the Tresure´s you can collect.In overall i would say play it and make your own opinion about this game!Here is now a small list how i would give points for the game in each categorie:Gameplay: 8/10 (Well made)Graphics: 6/10 (serve´s the meaning for the game and it fits good with the effects etc)Support: ?/10 (never had to go support)Price: 7/10 (5€ seems fine to me)Story: 3/10 (There isn´t really much about to say)Sound: 7/10 (like the Graphic´s it serve´s the Gameplay as well in a good way! like having a Jet to Fly with it´s effects)Performance: 10/10 (no problem´s @ all) FAZIT: 6.8/10 (well made game, but it could contain more Story in it for better gameplay and more Addiction for the game, as it really has good gameplay!)

And thus far, fairly good levels to boot.  I'm not sayig Beep os the Mari... must not use trademarked name... of the robot world.  but it's been a lot of fun thus far.

It was full screen and everything, however when I attempted to move my cursor to click 'next', an invisible box of sorts was locking me in the top left corner. So for a while I didn't play this game. When I again tried to, Instead of blocking my cursor, My screen only showed one fourth of the game, the top left corner. I had to search up how to put the game in windowed mode to even be able to play it.Second of all, there are no settings at all. not for sound, resolution, or anything like that. The game itself is actually completely fine, but the developers have almost completely disregarded the posibilities of the differently equipped systems that this game should be able to run on.So basically this entire thing is me complaining about how the it doesn't work 100% on my computer, and they should have some kind of configuration in it. because without it this game is very unapealing.fix it please.

												It's a very nice game, where you play as a small robot that collect orb fragments scattered on the levels also 3 antimatter fragments.You have a gravity weapon to move objects, obstacles or dead robots, and a gun to shot and kill the enemy robots.It's a really good game, and it's fun and addictive to collect all the orb fragments.The level select screen is a small solar system i loved that, its better than other games where the select level screen is just something with numbers.

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Platforming game.Interface/Menu/SettingsThere is a Mouse Speed slidebar available.There is a Music Volume slidebar available.There is a Sound Volume slidebar available.There are 3 different save files available.About the game.You are a little robot, with a small hover jet and some machine gun. It's Some sort of a mario game, because you have to collect coins and 3 stars and it is a platforming game. You have unlimited lives and you will get the option to go back to the last checkpoint. You also have a weapon to move objects, like dead robot bodies. You can take this with you to use it as a weapon. Like bashing it into the enemy's face. Or just small the dead robot body against the wall or ground :D. If you are leaving in the middle of a level. Every collectable that has been collected will be kept and you no longer have to worry about it anymore. Checkpoints however are lost. You are also able to move some platform with the ""Anti grav"", which is required to pass things.Graphics are a bit.. Cartoonish?? It's not high detailed same goes for the background.The music is calm.The Game is calm.Game has some Puzzle elements.If you are in a dark area, your light lamp will turn on and the light is well done though.Other things.None atm.-------------------I Give this game a 5/10			",462,169,6,45,48,1,62

												An annoying platformer, some will say this is fun because it's difficult, and I'm sure for some that is fine and good, but for me this doesn't do anything special or fun enough for me to want to spend the extra effort it takes.In the fourth level I started running into physics issues and that sealed the deal for me.  When my character just starts flying around the screen not because of anything I did (I think) and falling into a pit, I can't recomend it.			",140,55,0,40,8,1,23

												In BEEP, you are in control of a small robot that is used to explore other planets. It is mostly a platform game with slight action and puzzle elements. There are basically zero options provided to the player as far as graphics are concerned, and the game engine seems to have serious problems with frame drops and performance on a modern computer. The general presentation is basic, upbeat, lighthearted, adorable, and for all ages. The world map is amusing, as you are allowed to navigate through space with your ship and bounce off asteroids or space debris. Each planet looks different than the other, and the levels appear to have been designed well. The controls are implemented adequately, and are quite responsive even in the more dire platforming situations mixed in with some shooting or the tricky anti-gravity device. The robot's wheels also have an excellent grasp on terrain, which makes for some forgiving moments if you are new to the genre. All of this is not without some major problems related to performance. The game runs terribly on a modern computer that more than meets the minimum requirements. The massive frame drops, excessive lag, terrible slowdowns, and extreme choppiness make it unplayable. Others have experienced similar problems, and proof of it can be found in the game's Steam forum. This is actually quite unfortunate, as BEEP seems to be a good game at its core, if it weren't for the performance issues that break it. Perhaps with some developer tweaks and patches, BEEP will live up to its full potential and be enjoyable.BEEP is mediocre.			",1292,339,60,143,147,16,197

												BEEP has very little going for it. The overworld serves little purpose in the hour that I've played other than to make it take slightly longer to select levels and is overall awful. Once you get into a level the aesthetics are unappealing to say the least. The background and characters are cartoonish, but don't have any particular thing that grabs you about them, but the pickups (antimatter nuggets and cores or something) look like bad gif files of 3D modeling done by high school students.The music and sound I can't comment on as I turned them off within 3 minutes of getting in to the game. As far as the mechanics go the controls are sluggish and sometimes not responsive and the camera is attached to the cursor but not smoothly and you can easily get motion sick from the jitteriness of it.It isn't a terrible game but there are so many other better examples of interesting platformers that I cannot recommend this one.

												Just another unpolished, probably unfinished platformer. It felt like one of the games I would play for 5 minutes on AddictingGames as a kid. The art style is inconsistent throughout the game, and sometimes it feels like they didn’t even try. The gameplay isn’t anything special and the only redeeming feature, aside from it’s somewhat ok lighting and physics engine, is the anti-gravity beam, which only seems to work when it wants to and likes to drop things a lot.I would never pay a full $5 for this, but it might be worth it to someone else to sell a couple cards when it’s on sale for $0.19. In the end, I’d just recommend you go and play some free flash games or something instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												And yet another platformer which I'd love except for the controls. Come on, devs, if you expect me to do a skill jump while waving a robot around on a grabber beam (2-2, 2nd ""supergrain""), the least you could do is to make sure that:- Movement and grabber can be fine-controlled, separately- The grabber doesn't accidentally release the robot (in like 50% of the cases)- Once held in an orientation, the robot doesn't randomly revolve, exposing me to the big bad laser beamI like challenging setups, but the challenge shouldn't be hoping for the lucky situation where all controls work properly at the same time. Also, on a multi-try challenge, spending one minute to get back again from the last checkpoint tends to grate after a while.It may be harsh, but I'll keep giving non-recommendations to any game which frustrates the player by control inadequacies - no matter how good the other aspects are.

												I've never seen a game with this many hardware compatibility issues. Take a look at the forums, nearly half the threads there are people asking for help because the game won't start. Why? Maybe it doesn't like your sound settings, or your particular brand of headphones, or your monitor resolution, or the fact that you have a controller plugged in.			",207,29,7,22,51,1,17

												Worst game ever seen in the history of selling games. Maniability awful (target system and inerty extremely bad), soundtrack bad (I played with my music), no comment for graphics, and this is the concept of a flash game (some flash games are better AND FREE), I didn't see any fun in this game, but some people did, so maybe try it. If you want to rage and be frustated (I learnt I could be the most important rageous guy cause this game), buy it ONLY when it solded (0.19) but i advise you to go on Miniclip it's still better. It's a shame to sell this game 5 euros.... =/ And when some ennemies exploded, several big black square appear on your screen (=bug) and when plateforms become small, you can't see it cause these buggies. A shame0.5/20 because there are plateforms			",82,13,1,7,7,2,7
