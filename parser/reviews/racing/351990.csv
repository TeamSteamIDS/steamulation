Dear Devs, please do us a favor and include a Tutorial in game!Don't make me browse through 20+ topics untill I find out which button does what.Just to help you people, for Xbox 360 Controller:(A) - Boost, when you collect enough boxes and the msg appears on the screen.(X) - Break, you also tap it to drift on turns.(Y) - Change your camera view.(RT) - Accelerate, if you disable the auto-acceleration on Options.And for the tricks, there is no button for it. Your car will flip if you take only half of the ramp.As for the game:It's really good, very fast depending on the music you pick, and I think I can say the controls are ok. I wish I could race some other cars, even if bots.I had some problems avoiding barricades that I couldn't see, because everything has the same colour, and flashes.And one great problem that is probably a bug: Sometimes, after a jump, a turn appear, and it doesn't matter how hard I stear my car, it won't reach the track, and it's unavoidable to fall.But I do recommend this game, as I also recommend Beat Hazard, Melody's Escape and AudioSurf.

Early Access Review
Drive Any Track (DAT) . Review writted for Early Access v0.5.1.I write this in english to reach more ppl, but that's not my main language, feel free to let me know if I do some errors.If you are bored to read, go bottom I posted a little video.You understand how to play in about 5 min: Select a track on your hard drive (mp3, flac) DAT analyse your sound and create a track regarding the content If nobody have already used this sound, you are the creator of this track If the sound have already been used, you can select other best players as ghost (very cool to learn)Then the game start, all you have to do is keep sync with the sound by keeping inside bars If you are sync, you get 4x score bonus, or less if you are to late You can collect some bonus and use a boost, jump, flip to make points When you are in advance on the synch, you become super sync and get a 10x score bonus This is not a race, all you have to do is the best scoreWhat is missing actually in this game, for me, and I hope dev will now transform they little nugget into an awesome music game: Not enough beats effects, would be cool when the background city have more visual effects, something to make the game a lot more immersive (fireworks, flash on beats). It really miss a button to preview your sound. Must to have You can unlock new cars but actually you don't know why You cannot rebind keys, I think that will come in futur. Actually if you play with a pad you don't have to rebind there is only 1 button but maybe for keyboards users that can be usefull.To finish, I like too this EA Game cause the devs are present and love they baby, wait and read the feedbacks. So that's a good, really good start for me ! 100% recommended if you like to follow growing games and be a part of itHere is a little video if you are boring to read text and just see what look the game in actual state. I do 2 times the same track so you can see a new track and a track with a gost (and in both I suxx :-))

Riff Racer, what a game. To be honest, I did not expect it to be so good. This is one of those games that you put your music into and they generate a racing track, which fits the music. Even though it's in Early Access, it does its job better than other game of the same genre.Below the final verdict is the complete list of music that I've played for this review.Pros: Terrific surroundings (skyscrapers, spotlights, etc.) It does a really good job at converting the music into the track you are driving on. The drops are amazing, boost pickups are synchronised with the beats and even landings fit the music! Even though it's a racing game, I did not expect to see drifting in this game. It's awesome! There are jumps, flips, pickups, boosts and other stuff. There is a wide choice of vehicles that can be used in-game. Also, you can buy skins for them using ""chips"" you earn while playing. One of the main benefits (in my opinion): the graphic details are astonishing even on older computers. The game uses a low amount of system resources. There are no lags or disruptions in the music you're playing. Even if you crash, the music keeps going. This is not the case in Audiosurf, though. Even when you crash, use boost or in any way change your speed, the landscape is always synchronised with the current music. I don't know how they did it, but it's amazing. There are achievements and leaderboards.Cons: There is no music that comes with the game itself. If you want to play, you need your own music library first. | This feature has been added.  No autoplay/playlist option. When you finish a song, you have to pick the next one by hand. | This feature has been added. Achievement Unstoppable is not working properly. The player is supposed to unlock it when he completes a level without hitting any barricades. However, it can also be unlocked by restarting the level as soon as music starts to play. No advanced graphic options. I know I have mentioned in the upsides that you don't actually need to lower the quality as it runs just fine on most of the computers. It is still a good idea to include more options. Some barricades are extremely hard to see and therefore avoid, especially after jumps. If the music file is more silent than usual, the game sounds might be louder than the music itself. I only had this problem with The Writer, but there should be some kind of a detection system that would lower the game sounds, if necessary.The final verdict:There are quite a few downsides, but they don't really matter that much. I really enjoyed my time in this game so far as it is an awesome experience for both your ears and eyes. There is no quality loss when songs are played, there are leaderboards to make you compete against others and, above all, the game runs smoothly with low loading times. Buy this game. What's better than listening to your favourite music while playing a fun game?The list of songs I played: Shawn Wasabi - Marble Soda EXGF - We Are The Hearts Adiemus Max Min - Anonymous ZHU - Faded (Steve James Remix) Maraaya - Lovin' Me Marc Reeden - Take Me Away Freestylers - Cracks ft. Belle Humble (Flux Pavilion Remix) Clokx - Catch Your Fall Felix Jaehn - Ain't Nobody ft. Jasmine Thompson Belzebass - WTF Ellie Goulding - The Writer Lyre Le Temps - Looking Like This Carly Rae Jepsen - I Really Like You Fanic X K.Flay - Make Me FadeGreetings,BirdCuteNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

												So, I fire up Riff Racer: Race Your Music!. What do I want to listen to? Riff Racer allows me to select anything from my MP3 files, so I pull up my MP3 list of songs and decide on Gojira’s latest album (Magma). I decide the title track will fit my mood perfectly. Ahead of me lies a neon track, spanning off into the horizon and far beyond what the naked eye can see. The music queues up, the song begins and my car starts accelerating. I deftly maneuver around an obstacle, and then, heart racing, I take a slide around a bend in the track, narrowing missing the rail as I get my car under control, hit a boost point, and go flying off of a jump, only to barely land on the next section of track. Before me waits an amusement park loop which I take at super boosted speeds. The music blaring, the track continues to form before me, the beat and dynamics of the song dictating where the game will take me next. A few minutes later, I cross the blue finish line, having finished with 100% synchronicity, good for quite a few points. I now hold first place on a track of my own creation.StoryThis isnt applicable. The story is really the track and how it responds to your musical selection, and how you respond to the track in turn.GraphicsThe graphics are quite cool looking. As mentioned in my intro, the tracks in Riff Racer are neon constructed out of and into nothingness. The horizon is ever your goal, and Riff Racer sends you there full throttle in a glowing world of bass, beats, and guitar (or whatever makes up the whole of the songs you select). To an extent, Riff Racer’s graphics are minimal, and yet you cant help but draw similarities to games like Tron, albeit beefed up and modernized.Overall, the graphics in Riff Racer aren’t mind blowing, but they do look really cool. I would give them an 8 out of 10GameplayThis is where Riff Racer truly shines. As a game that creates your experience around the music you select, Riff Racer does an exceptional job of being a dynamic, time and points based solo racing game. You can never see very far ahead, and so you will be constantly reacting to the world as Riff Racer shifts and creates the track based on the dynamic of the music.There are loops, jumps, obstacles, boosts, and plenty of twists and turns that offer opportunities to not only race full throttle, but also to get your drift on. My own best drift was right at 16 beats. Jumps are also timed, and you score more points based on how many beats your jump is good for. Depending on the angle of release on your jumps, you might also spin in the air, which counts as a trick that also garners you more points. Additionally, any special moves help to fill up your boost meter.Your boost meter is an essential part of Riff Racer. Basically, boosting allows you to stay ahead of the beats, which is your ultimate goal. You want to at the very least try to stay with the first beat at all times, but getting ahead of it will net you even more points. In addition to tricks, there are also coins and boxes all along the track that will also help fill your boost meter. Finally, there are also boosts along the track as well. The more you stay in boost mode, the more points you will earn. Points will allow you to rise in level, which will earn you bonus coins.Speaking of coins, you will earn those in each track by running over actual coins and boxes, by creating a track yourself (which, in Riff Racer, means you were the first to drive a track with any given song), by beating existing top 5 scores, and so on. You can use the coins to buy different cars and different skins for said cars. There is a notable difference in the various cars. The skins are just cosmetic.The controls are tight and fully responsive. Any time you are out of control in Riff Racer, it is because you over compensated, generally as a reaction to having to make some split second decisions. You can of course play the same track over and over, so once a track for a song has been created, it will always remain the same, and you can memorize the twists and turns in hopes of getting better scores.Riff Racer does what it needs to do perfectly. I give gameplay a 10 out of 10.SoundThe sound is always 100% in your hands in Riff Racer, as it is always determined by your own musical preference. The music playing is always your own choice, and that is 100% the in game sound.So, this is an easy 10 out of 10 as well. It is exactly what you make of it. You are 100% in control of what you hear.VerdictAs a music powered game, Riff Racer shines in every way. Played for hours at a time or a few songs at a time, Riff Racer keeps on giving and giving. You wont ever really tire of the experience Riff Racer provides, and Riff Racer is a game you will continue playing 5 or even 10 years from now. This is what I would consider a must own for any music and/or driving fans out there. Good times will be had aplenty.			",2039,1022,52,316,205,18,280

												I was hesitating on this one since a lot of rhythm type games that generate tracks from user audio files feel kinda bland or else they have the problem of only being fun if you are using EDM tracks with heavy, distinctive beats. I was watching some trailers as well and was hesitating because I couldn't really discern what the game was doing with the tracks that would make them truly feel like you were playing the song.After spending just a short amount of time with it, it's winning me over very fast. It's called Riff Racer, which suggests guitar riffs, which suggests it should be fun with rock music, whereas a lot of music/rhythm games that procedurally generate tracks are not super good with rock tracks. I was super impressed to discover that playing rock tracks in this game feels very satisfying and the game can specifically detect if you are a playing a rock/metal track.As I was playing these rock songs, which don't have the heavy, distinctive beats that EDM tracks have, I kinda started to warm up to the things the game was doing to make you feel like you were playing the song. It was less about individual beats and more about the energy of the song. Placing a speed boost right when the chorus takes off. Dropping a huge ramp right when the song tears into a guitar solo. Shifting the lighting and colors to fiery hot as the song picks up speed and volume. Where Riff Racer lacks at emphasizing the individual beats of a song, it seems to excel at getting the visceral energy of a song just right. Of course I'd advise you to mostly pick out a songs that suit a game about hitting ramps in a fast car.The game has great controller support and the controls are fantastic. The driving feels almost as good as games like Mario Kart or Sonic All-Star Racing Transformed. The drifting takes a bit of getting used to, but its starts to make more sense the more you practice it.It's an arcade racer, so it's all about racking up points. Unlike other rhythm games, which focus on hitting the good objects and dodging the bad objects, Riff Racer does something slightly different. Hitting the good objects instead builds up a boost meter that you can use to trigger a manual boost (in addition to free boosts lying on the track). In order to get the most points, you need to go as fast as possible for as long as possible, hit collectibles, hit ramps (especially at an angle so that you can spiral jump for extra points), and execute long drifts around sharp corners. The faster and fancier you drive without falling off the track, flipping the car, or crashing into things, the more points you'll rack up. It's not just about hitting those beats (although it's that too); it's also about kicking butts.And of course there are global leaderboards, friend leaderboards, personal best, etc. The game comes with a bunch of songs bundled in, and you can use your own. You also gain points for racing tracks, and those points let you unlock new cars and paint jobs. The new cars and paint jobs are merely cosmetic, but it gives you something to work toward if you need that kind of motivation.The only downside to the game is that once you put 4 or 5 hours into it, race all of your favorite rock tracks, then you've pretty much seen the whole tour. You can still go back and score attack, but you're basically racing time trial on tracks that---while very fun---are largely similar, so it starts to get a little samey after a while.Rating the game on the scale below, I give it a hearty 6:7) A classic, essential, and/or must-buy game that is worth full price.6) A good game that is worth the full price.5) A pretty good game worth checking out--especially if discounted.4) A fairly good game, but I'd recommend buying it discounted.3) Not great, but a few redeeming qualities. Only buy if heavily discounted.2) Only worth checking out if you are dangerously curious.1) Avoid at all costs.			",216,124,3,41,18,0,24

Early Access Review
								Drive Any Track is a point to point racer that generates tracks based of your own music collection. While it sits in the same genre as games like Audiosurf, adding the cars with amazing drift handling really allows DAT to hold it's own. Not just a decent music generated game but one of the better arcade racers I've played in some time. Highly addictive and upon first play I was mesmerized by my screen for hours. The King is dead, long live the King.

			Drive Any Track PC Gameplay & Giveaway [60FPS] http://store.steampowered.com/app/351990/ Steam Review: http://steamcommunity.com/id/seph_au/recommended/351990/ Focus on steam games, indies and early...		

Gameplay is simple, select a song, choose your car and burn rubber. Tracks are all given a star rating which dictate their difficulty and harder levels generally contained more obstacles and tighter turns.  Provided the song includes an id3 tag your score also gets uploaded to both local and global leaderboards. Tried a wide range of genres from classical through to chiptune and overall music generation was not only quick but produced some wonderful results.  Faster music had more jumps and loops while slower music seemed much more drift based.While there is still plenty to add in future (real-time lighting, skyboxes etc), Graphically speaking it already looks quite tron-like and beautiful. Currently in-game options were slim to none but given the minimalistic nature of the game I would hazard a guess it should run very well on a wide range of systems. Didn't skip a beat scaling up to 4k+ on a single 970. Something that did seem to be missing was a bunch of default music tracks which was a little unfortunate as I'm sure it would help with the competitive side of the game.Most of the features I would like to see included in future are already planned. Such as further control of stunts, improved tracking of stats and additional game modes, cars and environments. With that said DAT contains 12 standard cars (+2 secret), decent selection of liveries and enough change of environment and colour schemes that it stays fresh. The games few downsides like sometimes being stuck on your roof following a dodgy jump, or hurtling round a corner into a badly placed wall are easily outweighed by all the upsides.Overall if you're a fan of music based games or arcade racers such as Ridge Racer, RUSH, Burnout, Daytona or Outrun. DAT is well worth your weekly allowance and has got my stamp of approval. Cheers folks, now back to racing. :]			",4107,1606,205,507,690,51,637

Early Access Review
								So far I'm pretty addicted to this game. My love for music might be an influence. Being able to race to the music on your own PC is really fun and games that do this always grab my attention. DAT is infact a great Early Access title and I've already begun racking up hours played. Even though its an EA title, it has plenty of content to enjoy right now. Unlock cars by leveling up or collecting tokens and buying them. You can also change the paint scheme on any of them with a few tokens as well. The gameplay's difficulty depends on the song you play. If you play something really slow and soft, you're gonna have an easy track but switch it over to something more upbeat and fast and you'll find a real challenge. On the track you'll find 2 types of pickups. The boxy one fills up your boost and the coin looking ones are for spending in the garage on cars and paintjobs. The purpose of the game is to stay up with the first line of synchonization. I believe there are 4 total and if you fall behind, you will be resynced. If you have friends that own the game you can race against their ghosts if you want and try to get better times on the songs they have played but I'm pretty sure you have to own the song yourself. The store lists the game with multiplayer as well. Unfortunately I have yet to get to try this since I'm playing before release, I will update this review with info on multiplayer once I get to try it.There are also leaderboards but the song you play must have an ID3 tag on it if you wish for the game to keep your score and place it on the leaderboards. (An ID3 tag is a little scrap of data added to the beginning or end of the MP3 file which stores information about the audio recording including the title, artist, album, copyright date, and musical genre.) I'm assuming this is how they keep track of the leaderboard scores. If you have music without a tag you can always get something like MP3Info, a great utility that adds ID3 tags and customizing to files. All in all I would say this game has great potential and recommend it to anyone who loves driving games and music.

Early Access Review
								This is one of those games that you will spend way too much time on.""1.2 hrs on record"" WHAT I JUST BOUGHT IT LIKE FIVE SECONDS AGO...I thought.What can I say? Riff Racer is based on the Audiosurf premise, except it's a real racing game.You also become a celebrity for being the first to play a song. So that's cool and all.It's also worth noting that it's practically impossible to play without a controller. I used an Xbox 360 Chrome Series controller, and it worked great. I would imagine that the game is much easier to play with an Xbox ONE controller, or maybe just a controller that *hasn't* had Diet Coke spilled all over it.Buy this game if you like music and racing games. Or, if you like racing games and you liked Audiosurf.Update: Why did you feel the need to change the menu system? The old static background and the audio track were so simplistic, which just felt right for this game.Also, seriously, you changed all of the car skins, and now I don't own a single one.To be fair, I bought it during early access, and I should have seen that coming. Still, though. Kinda annoying. ",110,24,9,14,9,1,8

												The game has a great concept, and it is indeed fun to drive around the twisted tracks, but this fun wears out too fast because of several reasons:1. Too Easy - Even when playing tracks than in other music-based games generated challenging levels, here barely any was present.2. Doesn't reflect music - Many times the music feels like background music, rather than the essence of the track.3. Little content - I was hoping for unlocks that increased intensity or added new gameplay mechanics, but all there is to it is grab blocks, drift around tight turns and don't miss the jumps.In the other side, the visuals are quite nice.

Do you like music?Yeah, me too!But, if you're like me, you hate just listening to music. You know, when you really just want to chill with your favorite songs, but not study, work, or read while you do it.You just want to chill. .....but, you feel like you're wasting time if you're just sitting there, doing nothing while you listen.This is where Riff Racer comes in.-----------------Now you can chill and enjoy your music, but without that feeling of idleness.Whether you're: ---Wandering a long, winding ambient tune, ---Navigating a bending, twisting jazz piece, or Traversing a plunging, rolling dubstep jam,It's relaxing, it's fun, and you'll find yourself hooked on it. -----------------I'll admit, Riff Racer is nothing special if you look at it purely as a driving/racing game, because that's not what it is.It's a tool that lets you experience music in a whole new perspective.Seeing the beat.....Feeling the flow.....That is what makes this game great.

												Just picked this game up on steam for a bit of a muck around. I have never been so impressed with a game under 20 dollars. Loads up a track based on a song you put into it in about 10 seconds, and that track (if you choose the right songs) is almost always perfectly reflective of the song. Great to see what other people are racing to in the charts menu as well! You guys have done an awesome job with this game!			",160,17,7,11,34,0,16

Riff RacerDeveloper: FOAM EntertainmentPublisher: FOAM EntertainmentIntroduction==========It's not often that I take interest in a game that even remotely resembles a racing game. However, Riff Racer is one of the extremely rare exceptions. Using your own music (or the included bundle of 25 songs) to generate racetracks, Riff Racer has you racing the music itself to earn points and coins. Your experience depends entirely on YOU and what music you load up into the game.Gameplay==========Riff Racer creates racetracks based on the songs in your music library. When you boot up the game you can direct the game to any folder on your PC with music in it and have it generate a special track specific to that song. All the different verses, choruses, drops, and more are styled to the music you load and become checkpoints.  Even the car you drive shares some characteristics of the music. The point of the game is to stay in time with the music and score as many points as you can. Staying in sync offers a 4x modifier, while being ahead offers a 10x modifier. If you fall behind, either by not using boosts or hitting obstacles, your modifier drops until you can catch back up with the music. Each track you load has a 1 to 5 star rating. The more stars, the more obstacles you'll face on the track. As you race on each track, you'll run into barriers, jumps, and pits that may impede you. There's also these small white cubes that fill up your boost meter. Collect 10 of these to get a boost at the press of a button. There's also coins to collect that are used to buy different cars and paint jobs for them. The points you earn go towards increasing your Driver Level. All this does, as far as I know, is show how much you've played the game. I've not seen or found any benefit to having a higher Driver Level.Graphics==========This game is pretty psychadelic. Sounds and colors everywhere, just blaring and blinking in time with the music. Mostly various shades of red and yellow, but it honestly looks pretty awesome. The backgrounds look pretty cool, as well as the buildings and structures you'll ride past. A small detail I noticed that's probably really obvious is that your modifier and your boost meter are shown on the back of your car. As your modifier goes up, your car will crackle with energy.Sound and Music==========The music depends on you. Play using your favorite songs for maximum enjoyment! I like video game music, so the vast majority of the songs I played are from some of my favorite video games. The gameplay demo videos below feature a Mega Man X remix and a track from Ys VI.Performance==========Riff Racer ran nigh perfectly on my custom rig. No FPS drops, played at 60+ FPS at nearly all times (dropping ever so slightly during Super Sync and Boosting), and no stuttering. I played mostly with my controller, but it's easy enough to play with a keyboard if you don't have a controller. You just have to steer and hit the boost key...simple enough right?Final Thoughts==========This is an awesome racer, even moreso if you play with your favorite tracks! Pretty much anyone can enjoy Riff Racer. You can tailor the game to your liking with different songs and car customization. If you get the chance to buy this game, I urge you to pick it up...especially if it's on sale.Gameplay Demo==========

												This is a fun, inventive, and interesting way to enjoy your music. If you like music and you like gaming, buy this.However, I want to address some concerns that negative reviews bring up:1) To those who say the game is too easy, I must insist you post higher scores than me on the same songs. This is why a leaderboard system exists. I will happily send you an mp3 gift of any song of your choosing, and then we can decide together if the game is too easy for you.2) I disagree that the specific song doesn't affect the track or gameplay significantly. The music isn't merely ""background."" In my experience, a song's crescendos, breakdowns, drops, and even minor variations result in loops, jumps, curves, and other set pieces. I can't imagine how one could miss this connection, but everyone is entitled their experience. Maybe my music is just more fun to drive.3) It's true that there isn't a ton of ""unlockable"" content. How could there be? This game is limited only by your music library. Yes, you can unlock new cars that only differ in appearance, and that's all there is to it. Would you really want the devs to artificially limit the manuverability of your car at the outset just to give you a false sense of progression?One of the most popular rhythm games of all time, Dance Dance Revolution, contained unlocks. What did they give you? New songs, new characters. This game gives you all of the songs in the world as tracks, but you can purchase a handful of cosmetic upgrades with the coins you collect from racing. It's not intended to be a deep experience nor should it be.4) If you don't have a gamepad, don't buy a racing game  on PC and expect keyboard buttons to have the same degree of control as an analog stick. That's the entire point of analog sticks.Honestly, I don't know what some people were expecting when they bought this. It's a racing game that builds racing tracks from your music. No, it's not <INSERT RHYTHM GAME HERE>. That's the point of being a new, different game.			",201,85,8,64,49,5,40

								Very good music driven game, fun and addictive. I'm a big fan of music games, this would be my 2nd top music game, Beat Hazard being my first and Audio Surf my 3rd.+Pros           Very satisfying fast and fluid gameplay.            Lots of replayability via leaderboards and unlocks.            Has the best soundtrack ever! -Cons            I think the price is too high but subject to change my opinion due to being earley access.             Very slow development.			",209,14,5,7,13,2,11

												A simple, yet fun and addictive game.  I definitely recommend Riff Racer if you like to relax and have some fun while listening to your favorite music. What really appeals to me is that you can use music from your own library and it generates a different track for each song. As you progress, you can unlock several cars and paintjobs.  Leaderboards are created for each song once someone has used them for the first time, and even though you don't have live multiplayer, you can race against a ghost car of top scoring racers, or your own high score.  One thing I would like to see is more variety to the colors and effects of the tracks. It does change depending on the type of music you use, but there isn't much variety, and sometimes the blur when you boost can be hard on the eyes.Also, while the tracks are generated based on the song used, it doesn't really feel like it for the most part. Occasionally, the track does seem to match the music quite well. But most of the time, at least with the music I have used, it just feels like you are racing with your song as background music.Even though I see some room for improvement, this game gets a big ""thumbs up"" from me, and I can see myself putting many hours into just relaxing and playing along to my favorite music.

												Edit: Disclosure: After some time making this review, I have worked on the game in a minor way.I don't think it affects this review but disclosing it to avoid confusion.This game is the glorified personification of what happened in my brain when I was 18 years old and drove my -87 Ford Fiesta in a forest road with thight bends with Dragonforce - Through the fire and flames at full volume. The pedigree of the game shows clearly, the roots of Wipeout are there in a very good way both in graphics and gameplay (Cannot say for other games mentioned as inspiration as I have not played those). Even though the game is still in alpha/beta/early, it's got replayability for years already. It does have few missing features, most obvious ones are the inadequate Options, incomplete gamepad support and some very minor graphical issue/feature that makes it difficult to see barriers when going very fast. To my knowledge, older gamepads don't work but apparently devs are working on it.			",35,2,2,7,11,0,4

Early Access Review
								The concept of this game is pretty fun. It's rare to see a music game where you're quite literally competing against the music. This game's got a lot of potential, and I'm already enjoying it more than games like Audiosurf. However, since it's Early Access (and it's only been out for one day) it's pretty rough around the edges. Sometimes the game will generate a huge jump right before a sharp turn, or create a barrier around a corner that you could never hope to see in time. Things like these can ruin your score, and it's the game's fault rather than your lack of skill. I've also clipped straight through the track more than once, and sometimes when you come out of a drift your car has a tendency to overcorrect itself and careen into a wall (tough cookies if this happens right before an ill-timed jump). I know it's an early access game, and I know there's no such thing as a bug free game, but these problems are the things they really need to iron out first.When the game works, I can't stress how much fun it is. It's certainly in a playable state, and it can only get better from here. I say go ahead and pick it up now before the price increases over time as the game gets fleshed out.			",110,8,17,3,3,0,0

  Feature Details Score  Gameplay A great choice if you specifically want to drive, drift and jump in actual cars to your music. 3/5  Car Handling It still feels floaty, like there's input lag. By default the car accelerates itself, but I don't think switching to manual would help. There is input lag. The drifting is excellent. 2/5 Graphics They are just about acceptable. Very basic models and skins. It's not distractingly bad when playing though. 2/5 Settings Very poor. You still have to listen to bad main menu music in a constant loop. Very basic settings. 1/5 Music Sync It's pretty great. Each track feels distinct and fun, with only a few exceptions. 4/5 Progression One of the few music games with a progression system. Earn coins to buy cars and skins, with bonuses for beating player ghosts or being the first to play a track. 5/5 Online Connectivity You can race with the ghost of a player, who will have their actual car and skin. Leaderboard system is okay. The new charts system looks bad. 3/5Songs tested:Feed Me - Death by RobotRJD2 - GhostwriterPentakill - LightbringerBo Burnham - SadToby Fox - Spear of JusticeDoctor P - Flying Spaghetti Monster			",445,129,12,35,46,3,45

												Riff Racer, previously called Drive Any Track, is basically Audiosurf without the match-3 puzzles. You load up a song from your hard drive, and the game generates a unique track for you to drive through, letting you compete for high scores with anyone else who's played the same track. The controls and presentation are simply sublime. Racing feels like F-Zero with its high speeds and crazy jumps; you really have to pay attention to the shape of the upcoming track if you don't want to wipe out. The smooth animation and futuristic visual style is wickedly awesome as well.Your score is mostly based on the stunts you perform; you get points for the length of each jump, double points for performing a mid-air roll, points for drifting around corners, and points for collecting crates. You lose points for hitting barriers, falling off the track, or flipping the car over. Additionally, if you start falling behind the song, your multiplier will diminish, and if you boost ahead of the song, you’ll get awarded with a whopping 10x multiplier. You can’t stay ahead of the song forever, so you’ll have to use your boosts strategically, not unlike star power in Guitar Hero games. Also interesting is that drifting won’t award points unless you’re actually driving around a corner – no fish-tailing exploits allowed.Although there's only a half-dozen game elements such as jump pads, boost pads, and collectables, the game succeeds in making every track feel like a unique experience – if you’re competing for a high score, you'll find that each track has its own distinct personality traits that you'll have to learn intimately. The track generator also takes some reasonable precautions to make sure you can see obstacles coming -- for instance, it zooms out the camera on loop-de-loops if there are barriers on the track, and it doesn't place barriers right after the peak of a hill. It demonstrates some impressive attention to detail, and makes casual play surprisingly relaxing and cathartic. There are exceptions, of course; you're bound to run into some surprising jumps and tricky turns, but half the fun of these kinds of games is memorizing your favorite tracks so that you can outscore the competition with the help of foresight. There's no difficulty toggle. However, some songs will be harder than others, denoted with a difficulty rating from one to five stars. If you want to find the most difficult songs, you'll have to hunt for them.The coolest feature of the game is being able to race against ghosts of other players. Oddly, the game doesn’t actually involve much “racing”; the only thing that matters is score, not your position on the track. Also weird is how you can’t race against any ghost you want, but only a predetermined list of 1-4 people who have beaten your high score (unless you hold the world record on a game, in which case you’ll be able to race against your own ghost and the ghost of the 2nd place holder).I give Riff Racer 8.8 / 10. This tops Beat Hazard as my favorite ""media player"" game to date. My only gripes have to do with some elements of the GUI; I wish the song selector were better, I wish you’d have more options of ghosts to race against. I wish you could see your boost meter and the ghost's score on the HUD without having to look at the cars themselves. It also wouldn’t hurt to see a few more game elements added to races. But overall, it fantastically does what these types of games are supposed to do: make you feel like you’re really getting into your favorite music. The final achievement is quite grindy, but I actually don’t mind, since I can see myself playing this game for a very long time. Well done. I'm not a big fan of Early Access myself, but you can mark this down as an Early Access success story.			",311,69,5,34,15,2,47

But now i just want to tell you one thing: This game made me actually feel music again, i listened to music again like i did when i was about 10, sitting in my room with nothing but a pair of headphones and cassette tape player. Probably because i actually had to focus on the music.Soon after the first few songs i got into a trance like state just watching and listening.This got way more than a simple and fun racing game for me!Thanks for reading.

												Let's face it, you're probably only thinking of buying this so you can live out your Initial D fantasies. If you are, you won't be disappointed. This game sure does deliver. Probably one of the most enjoyable ride your music type games I've ever played.Lots of fun on pretty much any high BPM song you can stick in it, can get a bit boring on lower BPM ones though. My Bloody Valentine songs end up disappointingly tamed in this, but eurobeat songs end up being really fun with lots of dorifto corners.The drifting is a fun mechanic, it reminds me of the drifting in Burnout Paradise. If you liked the drifting in that, you'll like it in here. The handling on the car can feel a bit floaty at first but once you get used to it you'll forget it was ever even floaty. A single minor complaint is that some of the obstacles you encounter on tracks can be a bit hard to spot sometimes, resulting in some frustration. But this is relatively rare, and if you're the type of person to care about score you're going to learn the song route in a couple of tries anyway so it's not exactly a big deal.In conclusion, it's really good. Lots of replay value and the drifting is very fun.			",265,59,6,41,18,2,19

								Whether it's cruising to ambient stuff, launching yourself off ramps when it gets intense or just drifting all over. This game has it all. Only problem is that it can't seem to figure out what genre my song is. Played Mozart's Rondo alla Turca and the game gave me an achievement for playing a Hip-Hop/Urban song.Aside from that though, I like it.			",86,17,1,3,5,2,15

Early Access Review
								As a Fan of Beat Hazard (Another Music Based Game) I saw this game and had to give it a try, I have almost 3 hours of gameplay into DAT, theses are my thoughts...   Gameplay  The Gameplay consists of you racing on custom tracks, hitting jumps, drifting around corners and avoiding barriers that slow you down while you try to stay in sync with your song, fall behind can result in you getting out of sync and losing the chance of getting a 100% synchronization on the song you are playing. There are currently 3 things I noticed you collect as you race, that is a 10 tokens (the currency), boxes that fill your boost and give you additional points to your total point score and a separate boosters icon that gives you a boost as soon as you touch it, keep in mind that this booster icon doesn't take away the progress of you filling your boost from you collecting the boxes, it is its own separate boost. This makes me think of the midnight club la's slipstreaming, you can build up the slipstreaming and use it, that way you don't use a nitrous bar, but you still get a boost. The Performance Optimization  is solid, constant 60 fps through gameplay with i5 3570k and gtx 760, The Recommended Requirements are pretty low, and I am impressed by that. A Intel Core 2 Duo and a Geforce 8000 series are pretty old components to run a game like this. But this makes this game playable for more people, so that is a good thing.  Song difficulty Rating System  needs some work I think, for example I played a song by the uk power metal/speed metal band ""Dragonforce"" and these guys make a bunch of songs with intense guitars solos, and their tempo of their songs are just fast and the game only rated this Dragonforce Song a 1 star out of 5 star and then I played the Nickelback song ""When We Stand Together"" and apparently that song is rated 5/5, so I don't know how it's rating system works, it must work in a way that I don't understand or it's just not very accurate in this Alpha build of DAT . There are other songs that I played that I felt didn't match what I would rate the song in difficulty based on the tempo of the song, etc. but as example of a song that I thought it did well in rating is ""Beneath The Tides"" by Ravenface, this song has a pretty fast tempo to it also, and the game rated it a 4/5 and I thought that was fitting and the Track Generation for this song was solid, lots of jumps, dips, and long corners to drift around (I got a 38 beat drift on the one part of the track and I freaked out haha) I found it a very fun song to race on, While on the Subject of Track Generation, let's talk about that next.  Track Generation  it's kind of decent for it being in alpha currently, it can do what I think is a good job generating to match a certain part of a song, but then in some songs, I will be questioning ""why did you generate (this part) of the track?"" but it is in alpha, so I am not expecting this to be perfect, but I feel it still does good for the most part, but might be because I just like hitting the jumps and drifting and the driving style of this game in general... Speaking of jumps and drifting and just the overall handling of the cars... let's talk about handling.  Handling of Cars  The handling of the cars are excellent in my opinion, the drifting is nice and you can really control your drifting which I really like. The Inferno Car is currently my favorite Car.     Ranking System   there is a ranking system in this game, it's seems to be pretty basic from what I noticed so far, you just get points from doing songs, and thus your points add up to level you up , the current reward that I noticed so far is some of the tokens in the game to buy paint jobs for your cars, which there are 2 paint jobs for each of the 7 cars of 15 or so cars total that I have unlocked so far.To Summarize+Fun+ Solid Gameplay=Decent Track Generation+Excellent FPS (solid 60 fps) / Low System Requirements- Song Difficulty Rating system needs a little work for some songs/genres+ Excellent Car Handling/Drifting= Ranking System is Basic, but Solid for this gameOverall 8.5/10			",43,1,7,5,4,1,0

								Bought this on a weekly sale, worth the cost I would say. It's a nice, relaxing game that is described best by its own title, you can pick songs from your music library and just, drive on them.My only real quarrel with the game right now is that at times, the system the game uses to determine the speed and difficulty of tracks is a little shaky. A relatively slow, acoustic-driven Porcupine Tree song (Pure Narcotic) was almost as hectic to drive on as a fast-paced Protest the Hero song (Tongue-Splitter), for example. When this gets fixed it's bound to be a lot more exciting - the illusion of speed on a ballad is kind of dumb and immersion-breaking, but maybe I'm just being overly pretentious.			",56,11,6,8,0,1,7

												I refunded the game because of a couple of reasons.1. It destroyed the audio quality of my existing FLAC or 320 kbps MP3 library when being played through the game somehow, I have an studio level sound-card for production (EDM Prod and Mastering/Sound enginering and Audio Technica M50s and I could tell right away that there was some major bit-crushing to my audio, deal breaker for me.2. While the tracks are generated based of you're music its hit or miss on how much the track actually reflects the elements of the song you choose, many times the track does not reflect the tempo, tried DNB, Dubstep, Rock, Rap, millage may vary throughout you're choices.3. Graphic options are very limited.4. Unlike Audio Surf 1 the tracks in this game have many sharp turns which sounds great except there are constantly roadblocks around corners that you have no way of knowing are there until you turn said sharp corner and it's too late thus interrupting flow and ""sync"" to the game, this is poor design imo.TL;DR Great idea, Poor implementation.

								I'm a huge ♥♥♥♥ing sucker for music generated games meaning games that make levels based on the mp3 files you choose from your computer.I played Audiosurf, Audiosurf 2, Beat Hazard, Symphony and Crypt of the Necrodancer. Drive Any Track is definitely one of the best music generated games in my opinion. If you played Audiosurf -- I'm guessing most people who look at this page have played that -- just imagine that but you control your vehicle like a car of a racing game (including drifting, jumping, stunting, crashing) and instead of collecting right colored blocks this is just about driving perfectly through the course. The faster you go, the more points you get.You can play against the ghosts of other players, which is really good. And the overall gameplay makes for some really intense or relaxing gaming, dependent on what music you're in the mood for.The song analyzing is very solid. Sure it's not perfect, but what games song analyzer is? But since DAT has more stuff and obstacles that match up to the music it feels more satisfying than Audiosurf ever did. And all of this is just the early access version. There is a lot to add or improve here but as it is it's already an extremely fun game. And the creators of the game seem very well organized and take this stuff serious, so I'm very confident they will pull through what they promise (which for example is live multiplayer until DATs full release sometime in october). I just hope more people will play this awesome game so I have more ghosts to race against and more highscores to beat!			",90,19,6,11,9,2,12

												Must be the music I like, since even the slow music sometimes throws me off the track with ramp after ramp after ramp.  That being said ...This is a great game.  It's quite enjoyable to run the tracks trying to get a decent score while listening to music you enjoy.Most of my music is two stars, with a few three stars, and I've had a few pop up as four stars.  I've yet to see a five star song from my music ...  Maybe I should be careful what I ask for, as four star songs are pretty wild!The way you get points is by doing stunts.  You keep ahead of the first bar for maximum points.  Just driving doesn't get you anything, although you can use periods where you need to just drive to collect coins (for buying different cars and skins) and boost pack thingies (that you can use to activate your own boost whenever you want ... provided you've collected enough of them).You always take about the same amount of time to make it through the track, so to get points you do stunts.  You run over ramps, getting as much air time as possible.  To get more points, you hit the ramps so the car spins ... but this comes with a number of issues that really justifies the extra score.  For instance, if you hit the ramp wrong, it's possible to land on your roof, or be flung from the map altogether!  So be very very very careful jumping, especially if you plan on doing the high scoring spins!You also get points by drifting.  I suppose this can be abused, but whenever I've used drifting unnecessarily, I've always bounced off the walls.  Great way to fall behind, thus losing points!When you use the boost, it helps you get caught up, or you can use it just before a series of jumps to get ahead of the bar, increasing your point yield.  I'm the sort who tries to get more bang for my buck, so I always try to optimize when I use it.  But I rarely play the same track twice in a row, so it's always something of a gamble for me.If you play the same track over a few times to get the highest score you can, you won't have to wait for it to rebuild the track.  But if you go to another track, then come back to the first one, you'll have to wait for it to be rebuilt.  There's a ""tip"" that says that ""you only have to wait the first time you play the track,"" but this is not entirely true.  It is only true if you play the track repeatedly, a few times in a row.Also, there are barriers on the road.  If bouncing off the walls, landing upside down after a trick jump, or flying clean off the road, aren't enough reasons to set you back, they stuck barriers on the road that will slow you down quite a bit.  Since you need to keep ahead of the first line to optimize your scoring, this can be quite a problem!You also lose points for every barrier you hit, so it's a good idea to avoid them for more than one reason.It can play m4a files, but not aac files.  Not a terribly large issue, just something to be aware of.  I do not know what other files it can play, as my library seems to be a mix of m4a and aac files.On difficulty:1 star - Very casual.  I think I've seen only one or two of these songs.  Maybe the Beehtoven one I played was one?  I don't recall.2 star - Casual.  This is where most of my music lands.  It actually has quite a diverse range of difficulty in this range.3 star - Normal.  You really have to start using all the tools it gives you to keep up here.  It can sometimes be pretty wild.4 star - Hard.  It's beginning to get wild here.  I've had about half a dozen of my tracks come up like this.  It leaves me crying with laughter at every surprise twist and turn it gives me, and it's hard to make normal jumps ... let alone the high point yield twisters, here!5 star - Insanity?  I've yet to see a song this hard, but I'm pretty sure most people would be falling off the track quite a bit here.  The maps may even be nearly unplayable!I generally listen to Indie music.  I look at the top tracks, and I don't see anything I actually have in my library on them, so I guess I can not race against the ""most popular"" track leaders.  In point of fact, it's pretty rare for me to play a track anyone else has played, so maybe I have it a bit easier than most people who play the game getting coins.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Absolutely amazing, what anyone who likes racing games would have wished Audiosurf was. First Music based game (and I've been playing since beatmania emulation) I've played that doesn't rely on stupidly ridiculous reflexes, but still feels like it matches the music. Really feels like you're driving the beats while trying to catch the melody and reacting to the rhythm. Awesome stuff! 10/10			",229,48,31,49,45,5,47

												When I saw this game at first I was pretty skeptical about acquiring it since I already had Audiosurf, but after it went on sale for 75% off I decided to try it out anyways.And I don't regret it for a single moment!This game has more immersive gameplay than just swapping lanes, the graphics are excellent and not very demanding with an overall pleasing design, it's easy to control once you get the hang of it, and there is no third party account needed.Easily one of the best games I've played so far.

								It's not a sophisticated racer, and the gameplay has less to do, moment-to-moment, with the music than in a game like Audiosurf, but it's a very satisfying fusion of the two concepts. The racing feels nice! And it's fun to do it on tracks generated by your music!			",3157,1249,116,341,428,32,485

												Recklessly driving at full speed to the tunes that makes your heart sing whilst being in sync with your surroundings. What isn’t fun about that?I try every procedurally generated music game I can get my hands on and although this may not hands down be the best one I have played, It’s most definitely not the worst. Music is one of those things that everybody likes as it is. These kinds of games make your chest race and gets your blood flowing. You can use whatever music speaks to you that you have downloaded to your PC to customize your game to your liking.I love that about this genre. Although I have only taken a half hour spin on this as of right now, I can already tell by how I felt playing a few of my favourite more racier songs that this is a fun game. I certainly plan on spending some more time on this.Each song is a separate level and can you even fight for a place on the scoreboard for that particular song. You can see where you rank amongst your friends and you even have the option before the race starts, to race against the ghost of either the big #1 for that song or a player that the game recommends for you to try and beat. Although the game is marked as a multi-player game, as far as I can tell that is as close as you get to multi-player.I initially tried playing with keyboard and mouse and did horribly, so swiftly switched to controller. I would definitely recommend you use a controller for this as it’s much easier to control, so much easier to get engrossed into.Looking at the trailer, I can admit that first off I thought it looked easy and I didn’t really see what the car mechanic could bring to the game. As this game is essentially Audiosurf with a car. But I have to admit that after playing it that it definitely isn’t as easy as it looks and that it’s actually fun having that thrill of driving (even if it is in a game) and having more control over what path you take. If you have the same or similar doubts, do what I did and just think that maybe it’s one of those games that is more fun to play than to watch. The graphics add to the atmosphere of the game immensely. For the most part, it’s dark and contrasted with bright colours. It gives it a night-life/ Tron kind of feeling which makes it to be quite a fun and surreal arcade-like game. All around I like this game. I think it’s definitely worth trying.TL;DR : It’s fun, the graphics are nice, it’s exciting and it’s generally a worth while game. If you like driving games and/or music driven games then this is definitely one for the collection.			",409,271,31,20,31,5,35

								Drive Any Track (DAT) is a fabulous game but only if you have lots of different types of music on your computer. So if you have things that you got legally (your progress is not recognized if you have an illegal copy) then this game will be very fun. Although, there are 10ish pre-installed tracks.The game finds the tempo of your music from an online service and creates a track with varying difficulty. Tempos from 100 bpm to 200 bpm are the standard. if its less than 100 then it would be counted as 0 being 100. So if you have  a song with a bpm of 50 then it'll be seen as 150 bpm. It is the same with 200+. If your music is 275 then it'll be seen as 175.Every track has its own leaderboard you can use to compete with yourself or with other people who have the same copy of the song you have. If you select to compete with the person in the next slot, the global leader, or one of your friends then there would be a ghost you 'race' against.The actual racing part of this game is weird. The goal is not to be at the finish first but to have the most points at the end. The best way to get points is race the apex, jump from the highest point you can, drift as much as possible, and stay in the 4x or the 10x point area.There are multiple cars you can race with but they all have the same stats except for the hit boxes.

												To put this review into some context, I would not by any means dare to call my self a driving game vetrean or say that I play driving games regualrly. Nonetheless I have mixed feelings about this pretty looking, arcade style music based driving game.First, what the game does well.I will say that the art style and visual aestetic is very pleasing to look at. The use of bright vivid colours against a dark road gives me flashbacks of similar tron-inspired games. The UI isn't so distracting that it ever affected my performance but an option to toggle them on or off would have been appreciated(So far the options only seem to allow for changes in resolution, volume and mapping keys)The Musical Enviroment Gaming Algorithm( or MEGA) is perhaps the games main selling point here. The game allows you to race on tracks that are designed around music chosen. You can select either music from the game or from your own music files you may have on your computer. Whenever you choose a song, a track is genreated based on the high/low pitches in music, use of cymbals or high-hats or where the bass might drop. While the game is able to generate these levels fairly well, for the most part I would experince the loud cresendo of a song while racing down a mostly empty stretch of road before the next ramo would appear several beats too late. That being said, the satisfaction of landing a jump off a ramp in time with a song beat is something that just feels undenaibly good.What the Game doesn't do so well...Remember when I said I had little experince with driving games earlier, with that in mind I personally distaste how the cars handle. Bearing in mind I'm playing on keyboard and mouse, the cars always seem to turn either too much or to little. I might try to turn around a bend but try and avoid on oncoming  barrier only to overcorrect the turn and smash into the wall. And drifting...Maybe it's just because I can't drift for♥♥♥♥♥♥but any attempt made only ever seems to result in collision with a wall whether I inteded to or not.Also, you know how peveryone who played Mario Kart pretty much hated playing Rainbow Road, well the same flaws can be seen here. At any given ramp, should it be approached at too steep an angle because you overcorrected, you will fall off the ramp entirely and slowly spawn back onto the track. While I wouldn't mind on any other racing game, the use of twisting roads and ramps meaning it occurs more often than I would like.With all that being said, I would say that while this game is probably not for me, I do think this is worth the discounted £8.24 price I paid to race against any of my music(None of which the game needs to liecence). The use of MEGA is something I appreaciate but I wish it was used in a more traditional Rthymn game rather than a less predictable arcade style racing game.Hopefully I may findone in the future.The game is good on the eyes and ears but feels too off for me.  If you enjoy arcade style racing games, you'll probably like this more than I will. Hope you enjoy.			",17,4,1,2,4,0,0

 My Honest Review: Drive Any Track - 15/07/08IntroI've always been fascinated by games that take audio/music and create unique tracks based on the highs and lows of songs. Audiosurf and its sequel have been long-time favorites for me. However, there was always something missing. There isn't a large amount of control you can give as you glide across a track to your favorite music.That's where Drive Any Track comes in. It improves upon that concept by giving you much more control over what you do on that track. You see that sharp turn over there? Yeeeeaaaaah... you can friggin' drift around that like a pro racer. What about that jump? Evil Knievel that as you sing along to the song. You have more control over how you literally drive the song.GameplayThe gameplay is a mixture of avoiding obstacles, collecting boxes for points/boost, collecting tokens for in-game customization, jumping off ramps (and landing them) all while staying in sync with the song you are playing. If you hit a barricade? You're going to lose some speed and possibly lose sync. Fail a jump? You might as well restart if you want that 100% bonus.As you finish songs to completion, you are given a place on the leaderboard for that song. If you were the first one to play that song, you are credited with being the track creator. Additionally, you are given XP for completing the song, which levels you up (which unlocks cars). The tokens you gathered throughout the songs can be used to buy paint-jobs for the cars you own.The game is essentially simple, which is to be expected of Early Access. Hopefully the developer adds some more game modes and spices up track generation.  Graphics/Sounds/Controls The game has simple graphics that allow the game to be played on a majority of low-end computers. The game is more focused on using simple, abstract and vibrant colors and lights to give the game more of an arcade-y feel that allows the game to portray different genres. I have not run into any performance issues as of yet.Sounds are entirely based on the quality of the audio file you are using. I recommend using the highest quality file to ensure the best listening pleasure.I have not used anything other than a keyboard for this game, so my experience in controllers or gamepads is non-existent. I can say that the games controls are simple and easy to learn. Playing on the keyboard is very useable as well. No need for controllers. Replayability The game's replayability is entirely dependant on the size of your music library. However, there are some problems where some songs will be given the wrong difficulty. Also, while every song has a unique track, it may get monotonous. The lack of different modes leave things to be desired. Overall The game is really good, it has massive potential. We just need some more modes to spice things up and increase replayability.+Very Enjoyable+Replayability based on music library+Simple graphics that fit the game+Addicting+Has a lot of potential+Leaderboard+Levels/Progress is recorded+Not many glitches/bugs+Steam Cloud+Developer IS ALIVE!/ Not that much customization (may change)/ Level cap prevents progress past 20 (may change)/ Track algorithm sometimes label songs incorrectly and give incorrect difficulties-Lack of variety in obstacles and jumps-Graphic options consist of only changing resolution-I suck at making reviews			",294,47,18,51,41,1,55

								So, after a few tracks, heres a little First Look review of DATOn first glance you might say that this game seems a lot like audiosurf, just with an actual car instead of a polygonal glider.And Mono Mode only.Well, let me tell you - its not. While audiosurf is pretty much always straight ahead on 3 lanes, this right here is an actual racing game.Now, steering-wise the game is as simple as it gets. Left and right steer, Brake and gas arent needed, that does the game for you, CTRL is a handbrake for drifting and Space activates a Boost. Thats it.Your goal is to run a racetrack made from one of your songs and rack up as high of a score as you can. To do that you have to ""stay in Sync"" as the game tells you.Before you runs a visible line, thats where the track is right now on the race track. YOu can stay in a measure of 4 bars behind it to be in Synch and get the optimal amount of points for your tricks. if you fall more than 4 bars behind, you lose a multiplicator until you are at least 7 bars behind, where the game will set you back on track (with a respawn phase where you dont get any points. same for when you fly off the track)If you manage to overtake the Synch line, you enter a Supersynched mode where you amass more points but your speed and boost is slightly dampened, so you cant stay up there forever.Now, to get said points you just have to drive (a few points each measure of 4 beats), Jump (either by ramps on the track or by gaps in the track itself) Roll (same as jump - slightly tilted ramps or after Corkscrew Boosts) and Drift (by Using CTRL). After finishing a track you get some Boni depending on how good your driving was.Now what do I think? As someone who is pretty much terrible at racing games, I must say it is fun, plays pretty simple and even on Songs rated 4 Stars (out of 5) I managed to stay ""in Sync"" 60% of the time. Control is responsive, riding your tracks and experiencing your music completely different (again) feels nice and the Ghosting Modes (Race the world leader, the best ranked friend or a recommended random driver for a track) are fun too. Also, the mechanic of ""discovering"" tracks, by being the first player worldwide who has ever played that song gives the game a nice way of saying ""Good job that you listen to different music!"" However, Songs have to be IDE3 taggedto be accepted as discovered.As much as I like the game, It does have some flaws - sometimes the levels are built pretty counterproductive - like you get a boost into a long jump onto a sharp turn or you corkscrew a good 20 meters left to the track, sometimes when you resync you getdropped into a hole or a wall and lose more time and progress and its not really appearent weather or not you are drifting or if a drift has ended or has been aborted somehow. But since this game is early Acces as of now, it has room upwards.Not that it isnt far up alreadyIf you like racing games and you love music, this right here is a good buy.EDIT: Oh yeah - another little beef I have with this game - it does not save after a track, so when the game unexpectedly crashed I found myself short of the spoils of the previous 6 or 7 races.

												Ive got it extremely cheap during the seasonal sale, but I'm going to make a refund. I have to say, I enjoy music\rhythm games, Audiosurf is one of my favourite games ever. The RR idea is all great, but the game is so messed up in many ways. It pretends to be a rhythm\music casual racer, but it's neither of them. Those drifts and stunts have very little to do with the music patterns. Those jumps and obstacles might have worked, but they rarely fit the beats, and the controls are mediocre. I think Megarace 1 had been better at car physics and responsiveness. I've played with my XB360 gamepad, and I had to google for the layout, as the menu only shows one for the keyboard. They're not exactly the same(to put it mildly)... And no, you can't remap. As an extra annoyance - by default it installs with the language pack basing on your current region, ignoring the steam language preference. The only way to change it is to look for the 'fix' and jump through some extra hoops.			",49,20,1,7,1,0,2

												I like this game. It took me a few hours to really decide whether I do, but I like it.If you come in expecting the racing game equivalent of Beat Hazard.... really, this is not much of a racing game. You never race against other cars, it's all... kind of like a ""time trial"" but with points. By default, you don't even accelerate or brake! If you accept it as ""just imagine if Audiosurf was a car drifting game"", then it's fun.You just steer, boost, and drift (and drift and drift), on these insanely long rollercoaster tracks. Using ramps to jump and roll, avoiding obstacles. Drifting and jumping score points. It's addictive, almost hypnotic.Most of all, it's a new way to enjoy your MP3 collection, and to me, that's worth a lot. :)I do wish this game could connect to the streaming sites, e.g. Spotify, Google Music, Amazon Prime Music, or whatever. There are so many tracks I own but aren't actually downloaded.BTW - I got this at 75% off in a sale and have no regrets. At the full price, however, I may have written this review grumbling about the game needing more features, diversity in track layouts, etc.			",1009,526,27,169,158,9,198

								Fun game, Not completely functional at some points, but it has't even been out for a day, in early alpha access,  so that's okay.Some tracks could be a little more wild, I kinda miss the bumps you had with for example Audiosurf, also .wav and .fac files are not yet supported, but those are things I expect in the near future.My steering wheel currently is not supported, but I've been told that this will be changed in the future.The game is a bit challenging, which is a good thing, all with all, after being in alpha for a half day I'm fairly happy with the game so far.I recommend this.

												It blows my mind just how well this game builds it's tracks to YOUR tracks. I've run through tracks ranging from Starbomb ( a video game comedy bad with several musical styles ), to Lindsey Stirling ( ""dubstep violin"" ), to metal, to 8 HOURS WORTH of anime opening theme songs. (Don't you judge me! >.<) Every single track is built in such a way that it flows, bounces, and drops to the music, yet at the same time I haven't found an obstacle or jump that I can't avoid with a little fine tuning in future replays. Every blockade, even the ones that seem like bullsh*t the first time you hit them, can usually be seen in the distance while you are coming up to them. The game does occasionally spawn ""trick ramps"" in my experience that you have to avoid, or you will ramp into nothingness because they are placed too early in the road. >.>Fair warning though there are a few physics bugs here and there. There have been multiple tracks where I've managed to gain enough speed (on the default mode of auto acceleration and brakes) with a player activated boost to slam right through a ramp and lose ALL of my speed, ruining that current run. Only once, I've even been able to smash through the road itself and fall off the level, in which case it just respawns you a beat behind as usual. These are things that I have successfully avoided in future replays of the affected track by changing boost timings. TL;DR It's f*ckin awesome. Better than Audiosurf, and the most fun I've had with my own music since Beat Hazard. I come back every single time I get new music to see just what it'll generate for me next.

												Surprisingly actually NOT Audiosurf!Of note on that count is that it is, indeed, a car you are driving. That means means you CAN spin out, face the wrong way, and fall off the track.I like it better than Audiosurf 2, no contest, whether I'll play it more than Audiosurf 1, I'm unclear on as of yet.Not disappointed with it, either way.

								This game is awesome. I love being able to race to my own music, its awesome. Only downside that needs to be changed, is a tutorial level. Something that explains many of the games components. My best guess is that each bar is one beat behind, because the bars vary in time based on songs. It also mentions that each genre has it's own cars, yet you can play any car in any genre, which makes no sense.			",139,3,19,6,8,1,9

												Well what can I say? The game is fantastic, I couldn't stop playing it for the first hour I had it. This is easily one of the best music driven games I have ever played. Think of Audiosurf, but on lots of drugs.Pros:Looks nice.Game is very fun, especially on faster songs. My personal favourite being The Rise of Pre-teen Homosexuals by Helblinde. A video of that song being played can be found here:

Runs well. It is controller compatible, which was a must as my old IBM Model M wasn't up to the job to play this well.Cons:The map generation can be a bit wierd sometimes, a couple of songs I had a problem where I would go off a ramp at full speed but fail to land on the other side as the track fell short.The colours do get a bit stale, from what I have seen it is only purple and red, it would be nice if the colours of the track were customisable or had more variety. If there is a way to change it please correct me.Overall the game is great, buy it if you like music driven games.			",110,12,2,14,13,0,7

												Riff Racer is my new favourite music game - and I'm a huuuge fan of Audiosurf (first one, not the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ second one). And while in Audiosurf I prefer pushing myself over the edge with concentration and reflexes (hello Ironmode Ninja Mono), with Riff Racer I can just not test my reflexes, but also really enjoy the ride. Weither it's technical death metal, synthwave or hardcore underground hip-hop - Riff Racer shines with all the music you can throw in it. It's just that sometimes difficulty and trickness of race tracks are unpredictable - you expect a real storm and only get a calm and boring track, but sometimes it goes vice versa. But it doesn't really matter, because racing in Riff Racer is really fun and you can enjoy your favourite music in a completely new way. The only addition I would really like to see is an implementation of some records system like Audiosurf has, where you can view the leaderboards, notofications when you've been dethroned, friends scores etc.			",211,28,21,15,19,2,18

												Please note that I've purchased this game in a bundle at https://www.bundlestars.com/en/, in the ""Killer Bundle 8"" for  $5.00.If you love music, you'll love this simple indie game.It brings old arcade racing games back, but you can now play your own music with it.I have no complaints about this game. Sure, it may not be the best looking game, but having some of my favorite music in a video game is amazing.Pros - • Supports controller.• Every level changes per song.• Difficulty varies depending on song.• You get to change what song to race to (obvious).• You can compete with leaderboards, even if the game doesn't have the song in their bundle.• Achievements.• Steam cards.• Cosmetics you can work to unlock.Cons - • Can't use music from Soundcloud, Spotify, or YouTube. It has to be on your drive.• Sometimes the controls are weird. I hit walls more than I should.• Is originally $10.This game is simple, and fun.I would definitely recommend if on sale, or if you just want to race to your music.Just for a little more information, here are some songs I've played through my playthrough.The game also does offer it's own music, but I liked to play my music.• Porter Robinson - Lionhearted (feat. Urban Cone)• Porter Robinson - Sad Machine• Fetty Wap - Trap Queen (Kasbo Remix)• EDEN - Hey Ya• Flux Pavilion & Mathew Koma - Emotional (Virtual Riot Remix)• Gazzo - Say (feat. Jeff Greenspan)• Puppet - Scribble (EDEN Edit)• Artson & Jay Colin - Endless (Going Deeper Edit)• CAZZETTE - Blind Heart (feat. Terri B!)• CAZZETTE - Sleepless (feat. The High)• CAZZETTE - Together (feat. Newtimers)			",369,98,6,29,29,5,31

												I haven't really digged deep into this game, but I think I can give a few useful directions to whoever is looking into it:As a game, Audiosurf is better. Much better. However, its match three mechanics are also a big distraction from the music (to me, anyway), and you mostly go with the rhythm. Riff Racer seems to be at its best when you're using it as a virtual habitat to your music. The biggest problem is that it somewhat limits the kind of music it goes well with. The level do follow the music (contrary to what most people seem to be saying), but not in a beat per beat basis, on my experience. They mostly follow the flow of the music. If you listen to 3minute songs, exclusively, with the standard verse-chorus progression, you won't have as much fun. With longer songs, however, with multiple parts, some faster, some slower, etc., the game creates various different sections of the levels that can be really fun! Most striking is the amount of drifting and ramps you'll find.I prefer this to Audiosurf (at least so far), because the drifting is quite a lot of fun! Audiosurf is simply going left/right. Since I'm not interested in the score maximizing match three in it, I stuck with the monochrome mode, which isn't all that fun. With Riff Racer, controlling the drifting and dodging obstacles is a blast, at times! Now, about its limitation: the game is full of neon, bright colors, futuristic city with looping tracks. I don't really think it fits the blues, or classical music. You may disagree, but that this is mind.Where it shines, though, is with some electronic (retrowave, specifically, as I don't really listen to or know a lot of electronic music artists) music. Perturbator and Dynatron are gateway artists to it. And with this type of music, the game is really, really fun! The driving isn't too distracting, so you can both enjoy the music and have an environment that fits.Honestly, I'd like to see something like this, but with many more different environments, tailored for the different music genres. Maybe I'll try Driving Truck Simulator for some blues/hard rock. This isn't really a review, but a rather confused collection of thoughts. Regardless, hope it's useful!			",472,130,11,42,29,3,58

								Do you love music? Do you like rhythm games like Guitar Hero? Audiosurf?Then man you would love this game. Able to turn any song saved on your computer(sadly it can't pull from something like Youtube or Pandora or Last.fm or any internet radio, you must have the file) into a track that you can race, you can experience your music in a new way. Whereas Audiosurf limits you to three lanes that you have to shift between, this game allows you full of control of a car of your choosing, able to drift, jump, roll and drive loops.PROS:-Excellent functionality creating new tracks for songs.-Ability to 'tag' a song by being the first to upload it- your name is attached to the song as it's 'creator'.-Car designs are interesting and likely one for everyone-Active leaderboards(for popular/well known songs, anyway, though more users will bring more activity)-Easy to navigate menus-Pretty good visual design. Each main 'theme'(Rock, Dance, 'Urban', among others) is uniqueCONS:-Leaderboards are currently dominated by people who shove their nose in every possible corner and drift anything available. It needs a serious adjustment to the score system for attempting to take first place to be fun again.-Some songs(I've noticed it particularly badly with some Rock/Metal songs) end up being fairly boring. The algorithm doesn't seem able to read songs without much variance in intensity very well.Overall a very fun game, I picked it up on sale and for the 5$ I paid -extremely- worth it. I'm still playing it and likely will as long as I remember that I have it, it's a ton of fun to load up your favorite songs and drive the tracks that the game creates for you, and people will be attempting to one-up each other on the popular songs until the servers no longer exist, whenever that might be.Definitely worth it if you love music and driving.

								I'm new to Steam and couldn't figure out why my new F710 Logitech controller worked for some games but not this one. I was worried it was due to this game being early access. However, I've figured out my controller and got it to work for this game. And now I love this game! I've been looking for something like this and it is way better than Audiosurf (I tried Audiosurf's demo). I love that I can use my own music, how the game changes to the music and its tempo, love the visuals, and the controls seem very responsive. So far my favorite game to play. I was a big fan of driving/racing games for years and this is perfect for zoning out and having fun.			",73,24,8,5,4,0,1

												I've only played this for three hours (as of when I wrote this review), and it's already addicting. I love the fact that a new track generates depending on the music that is played. The course faithfully keeps up with the rhythm, if you are quick enough.When you discover a track that has an artist name (there is something else, but I forgot), it will be AUTOMATICALLY uploaded. This is a problem, what if I don't want to upload? I ended up accidentally uploading a sound effect. I hope there will be an option to manually upload things in the future.The courses themselves are actually not too shabby. I like how the courses arrange themselves, the developers programmed this in such a way where I want to keep coming back with frustrating dubstep sounds, just to see how hard it will be. Just TRY doing ""My Hope Will Never Die"", it will be a looooong time to master that course.The controls aren't bad, either. I use a controller, and it works smoothly. There is automatic controls and manual controls, all they do is control whether YOU want to control acelleration, or if the game will automatically go full throttle for you.There are other cars...I think you unlock them by playing specific genres of music, but I'm not too sure. And besides, they're just different cars. no enhancements, or anything.There is a pause button...good.Score: 8/10 the game met every expectation from me, but it wasn't good enough for a perfect score. The game was perfect technically, but the game in general is just an 8. Now is an 8 bad? NO.			",41,7,1,3,2,0,1

												Seems like a good concept but the tracks it generates very rarely seem to reflect the music you drop into it.  Its idea of difficulty is to throw unavoidable obstacles in your way.  The super fast snaky tracks are fine, but barriers that only show up when you are literally about to hit them are just bad game design.Ultimately if you want to play a game whilst listening to your music you'd be better off playing something else and playing some music in the background.

												JANUARY 2017 UPDATED OPINION... (original review below this one)After coming back to this game after my initial purchase, I can say -some- of what I wrote in my original review might have sounded harsh. Most of the negatives still stand, but I feel this game is more of a ""hmm, it's ok"" than a downright ""no"". I have to say that ""listening to your favorite music while driving some random track"" is probably how I feel about it. Having a score to beat for one of my favourite bands (SCANDAL) has finally allowed me to appreciate this game more - even if the other guy has totally obliterated any chance I have of getting the best score.I still feel this game would be better if music packs were available to purchase - there is a lot of indie stuff out there, and I'm sure paid DLC would go a good way to making this game ""bigger"". Again, what I originally said in my original review still stands for the most part.END OF NEW OPINION. OLD REVIEW BELOW.Tl;DR - Stay away if you're expecting either a good racing game or good music game - this is neither!Got sucked in to buying this game, expecting more of a rhythm based game, than a ""randomly"" generated track to play from the song I selected. Unfortunately, it's neither a good racing game, nor is it a good music game: you are literally just racing with music in the background, and for most of the songs you try, the track will be fairly unexciting.Pros:• Select any mp3 song from your computer to generate a track• Trippy race-tracks• The cars all handle differentlyCons:• Very small selection of songs to choose from in-game - no songs I've heard of. This begs the question - did I just pay for a song to race-track generator? If so, I am disappointed.• Lacks any sort of story, and no proper levelling system, so it doesn't keep you wanting to play more; the only reason to keep playing more is to unlock more cars and paintjobs.• You're playing a race-track which has no real ""rhythm"" aspect to the game - it's all about doing drifts, keeping speed up, and not hitting walls or obstacles. Take away the music, and you'll realise you're just playing a lack-lustre race - the music only dictates the generation and ""speed"" of the level, not anything else.• The average song you will throw at the game will usually generate a rather boring track, I've found some of the weirder songs to generate better tracks. For example, I tried ""Cherry Bomb"" from Silent Siren, which created a challenging track, but then used a song from F-777 - Chinese Dance Machine, which created a rather tame, boring track. There doesn't seem to be a clear method to how a good race track gets generated.• No real feeling of accomplishment, as it's not like you can directly challenge others to beat your score unless they also have the same song (requires friends who also have this game), and you can't challenge a persons song directly either, you have to link your song first, there is no way to search for songs already played by others.The main thing that has gotten me to keep playing is the experimenting of throwing different songs at this to see how complex I can make the race track, and because I'm a bit of an acheivement hunter, I'll be ""grinding"" to get those cars and acheivements as well.Verdict: A drag to play, grinding for acheivements, no sense of competition/accomplishment. Like I mentioned, it's basically a race track generator without the real fun of a good racing game. Basically boils down to a zen-game in a way because of it. Not recommended unless the devs pull finger and integrate some sort of challenges that people can strive for, to give them reason to keep playing.			",1569,695,73,134,55,17,121

												This may be my favorite game. I've played it for 382 hours & I'm still not even close to getting bored of it. Driving on tracks generated by your favorite music while trying to get better scores than everyone else by doing aerial rolls & drifts & getting items is amazingly fun.The aesthetic of a track depends on the genre. The game figures out the genre of a track by checking the band name on music hosting sites/programs. The game tells you an estimated difficulty rating for any track & there's a thread on the forum where people have listed tons of 5-star tracks for really hardcore players.You can easily find really easy tracks or really hard ones so the game's good for casual players & hardcore ones. If you wanna see more gameplay footage, you can check out my Youtube channel or the videos I've uploaded on Steam or you can watch any of the countless videos other people have uploaded to Youtube & Steam.Cons: Don't play Fell in Love with a Girl by The White Stripes.

Update 6/25/15: Originally, I did not recommend this game and reviewed it negatively, but since then my concerns have been addressed, so I've put my old review as a comment, and here's a new review:This game is very fun, especially if you have a library full of fast-paced, exciting, energetic music, which I fortunately do.Controls are a little gooey, but not awful. The car is still a little slippery to control, but I think either that's been fixed or I've just become more accustomed to it.All in all, with the improvements to the track generation removing the issue of hidden obstacles for the most part, I can say with confidence that yes, I recommend it.

								While still in early access the game runs extremely well and can be a beautiful representation of your music, as well as a fun way to experience your library.  I wish there were more included tracks, charts showed songs based on difficulty, and the sorter for previous tracks is not always correct.  Other than those shortcomings, I highly recommend this game.  You can race a ghost or solo, but if you and some random guy start going at it online for the top spot in some random song you both love.....well lets just say this game reminds me of guitar hero, in the best way possible.  I couldn't stop playing ""Through the Fire and the Flames"", I couldn't help but work on my drifting, learning the ways to maximize points.  This game is fun, the controls are tight, and thr price is just right.  10/10  would drive thru fire and flames again and againPS: Secret Cars based on musical selections, good luck!

								Next Audiosurf?The game is amazing, smooth and nice to play, yet hard to master. Own music makes it hilarios when suddenly you lose the road under you.Pros-Fun and Nice-Smooth and Simple controlling-Beutiful desing-Some Customisation options for the carsCons-Level generation can be wobbly sometimes-Needs something like a ""song of a day"" thingy- Really would like some kind of level customisation options?Make this thing to be the next Audiosurf..

								I'll make this brief and easy for you (gurl...)Is this worth your money?  HELL. YES.Is it fun?  See previous answer.Will you be playing this game a week from now?  See the previous previous answer.Why is this review so short?  I HAVE TO PLAY MORE OF THIS GAME, PLEASE STOP ASKING ME ALL THESE QUESTIONS...*Editor's note:  Ted really enjoys this game.  He cannot stop raving about it.  I believe at one point he said it was the most fun that he can remember having in a game.  He doesn't make statements like that very often.  And if you know Ted The Trout like I do, you know he's made a LOT of statements about a LOT of things, many of which we can't print here.  Just know that while you're reading this, he's more than likely still playing this game.  That is assuming, of course, the authorities haven't taken him back to the psychiatric ward and made him start taking his medicine again.*			",452,142,23,45,36,12,19

								While still in early access the game runs extremely well and can be a beautiful representation of your music, as well as a fun way to experience your library.  I wish there were more included tracks, charts showed songs based on difficulty, and the sorter for previous tracks is not always correct.  Other than those shortcomings, I highly recommend this game.  You can race a ghost or solo, but if you and some random guy start going at it online for the top spot in some random song you both love.....well lets just say this game reminds me of guitar hero, in the best way possible.  I couldn't stop playing ""Through the Fire and the Flames"", I couldn't help but work on my drifting, learning the ways to maximize points.  This game is fun, the controls are tight, and thr price is just right.  10/10  would drive thru fire and flames again and againPS: Secret Cars based on musical selections, good luck!

												I'm seeing a lot of negative reviews regarding the music being only ""background music"" which is simply false. You can play any song you want and the difficulty is judged by the amount of bass, hats, snares, treb, etc. Simply put; if your song is bumping louder than Godzilla's roar then you'll have a 5 star song. If you're playing a song like ""Gywnn Lord of Cinder Theme"" (like I did) then you'll have a song that's around 2 stars. Disregard metal and rock songs because most of the songs are too heavy to really detect properly, you'll still be able to play them, just not as you wanted. Double basses don't register too well. ""Deadly Sinners - 3 Inches of Blood"" would be a no-no. If you really want to counter my claims, let me know. I can post a video of me playing two different songs showing how drastic the change is.tl;dr:The game is amazing and if you enjoy sitting back and playing your kick♥♥♥♥♥songs, get this game.

												By no means a terrible game, but with several weaknesses and flaws, especially in comparison with Audiosurf.First of all: There isn't much do to, besides trying not to crash and grabing collectables. You maximze your highscores, via drifts and jumps.Secondly the game offers you a level system and to purchase a selection of cars - with no effect at all. Cars differ minimalistic in (hitbox)size and that's about it. In Audiosurf you get pretty much a new game mode with each ""vehicle"", so that is vastly superior.But my biggest gripe: I don't feel it. With Audiosurf the track really comes alive. Riff Racer manages to connect me with a song maybe in 1 out of 10 runs. I simply expect much better in that regard.So if you already own Audiosurf and still want more, go and buy Riff Racer on a sale. If you don't have Audiosurf yet, don't even consider getting Riff Racer first.6/10			",379,148,13,72,51,5,113

												I like the game and give it a thumbs up.Its a fun racing game that generates tracks based on the mp3 files you choose.You can tell it where the mp3 files are located, bookmark those areas in the game, and select whatever music you want (mp3.)I like trying to compete against other players ghosts, there are achievements, and you can keep replaying tracks trying to get better and unlock other vehicles.I don't like the fact that if the game's servers ever go bye bye you won't be able to play tracks other than what's provided with the game, and that new tracks have to be reread every time you reinstall the game or install it on a second computer.This game needs a back/restore option for tracks.I picked it up from a bundle cheap. I've played nearly 10 hours on the game and will play more. ",1215,364,66,167,107,11,151

												Wish I could give it a neutral rating... since it's still got a lot of potential and it's so cheap.As of right now, (2/19/17) it just feels really hollow. Graphics (at least on the ten or so tracks that I generated) are mostly monochrome. Just big abstract towers of flashing purple or red. They're kind of static and they don't seem to react to the music the way graphics in AudioSurf 2 do.Also, the tracks themselves seem a little tame. I was expecting bigger jumps, more corkscrews, explosions, etc. Sadly, even the hardest songs seem to produce the same bumpy straights and hard turns with an occasional loop and a handful of ramps. They get the job done, but they're not much of a show.Overall, I think this game needs to embrace the ""racing"" aspect a little more. More action, more variety, maybe something to race against... because right now it just kind of feels like an uglier version of AudioSurf 2 without mod support. Hell, if you leave the ""Auto-Accelerate"" option on in the settings, you'd almost forget it's a different game.For now, I'm going to refund (for those reasons and also because it lacks WAV support... and I don't wanna convert 300 files to FLAC just for this game)... but I'm still holding out hope that this can be great in the future and I'll keep my eye on it.

												I absoloutely adore this game.Its exactly what it says on the tin, Wipeout meets Audiosurf.But its a satisfying marriage that sometimes has moments that even best its lovely parents.PROS- Tight controls and physics, even in midair. If you fall to your doom it feels like your fault (usually :p).- Simple score system that has lots of aspects to it. When to boost? When to jump and when to go off those flips? When to start drifting for the longest drift? Little things can go a long way when going for highscores.- Unlockables. Its a little thing, but I always love unlockables. Gives you more reason to play beyond mechanical reasons (which the game does wonderfully mind you)- Nice, (generally) cohesive graphics that can run on any ol toaster like mine :)- You can sort of snake with practice. Givin' me the GX goosebumps ooh.- Ghosts are very well done and racing them gives a good competetive feel.CONS- Gui is servicable but text and buttons are too large. Text doesn't scroll when selecting new tracks so if a song has a long album/artist combination you can't read the track name :<- Surprisingly even with unlockables, customization is minimal. Theres no graphics options, Audiosurf 1 alone had selectable ""intensity"" colours and custom skyboxes. I would prefer if I could choose the track type for a song as proper genre data isn't always available so you get stuck on ""Dance"" a lot.- There are some rare issues with track generation. For instance, ""The Hamster Alliance - Falling Through The Air"" has a jump that you can rarely make without boosting. This is a reoccuring issues it seems from the bug report page. It makes tracks that would otherwise be low difficulty have a semi-frustrating aspect to them, cause you have to count jumps and remember which ones are death traps.- There isn't proper leaderboards or statistics. You have to load a song to see the leaderboard. I know for a fact my highest score is about 210k but the game doesn't list that anywhere that I've seen. Also, doesn't have the cool aspect of Audiosurf where you had to try and keep your thrones. I loved that, was a good way to bring you back into the game.TL;DR, super fun singleplayer race/music game, with a degree more customization and a gui overhaul it will really shine.

Early Access Review
								This game is a lot of fun.  The drifting system is my favorite part. There are a few things you might want to change though, it's very easy to keep generating ""new songs"" for 100 coins. A lot of people get all of their money related achievements this way. You can simply make an mp3 file, duplicate it 100 times, and change the name of every file. No, I didn't do this, but it would be very easy to.I also think the game is kind of confusing when it comes to choosing original songs. Whether or not most players are using pirated music, it would make a lot more sense to just go by the IDE song name and artist. I've raced top 40 songs straight downloaded from Itunes, and was supposedly the first person to race that certain song. I think this is why you see so much participation in the bundled music. Which isn't bad, but let's be honest...There is a lot of great things to say about this game. I don't just use it for music, It's a good way to get through lectures as well. Which is a great way to learn, get points, and satisfy your ADHD. MM.Pros: - Drifting system feels flowy and fun- First game in the genre that doesen't require tapping your foot or finger 200mph- Concept is killer. - The achivements were fun to get.- Paint jobs are decent.- Last.fm genre API works great. Cons:- Lack of upgrading in garage- Community and game feels thinned out from unecessary song recogniztion (imo)- Not possible to connect to Last.fm (I think?)- Game feels a little bit too easy.- ""Destruction"" achievement and the walls behind jumps dont add up.Overall Rating - 7.5/10 - I would recommend this game to anyone and enjoy it thoroughly, despite its flaws and ""early access"" feel.

Early Access Review
								Bear in mind, the game was an early access game at the time of this review.While this game can be very fun, there are some flaws that can marr the experience for some.First off, the game looks good. There are a few issues with the car having tiny white spots dance all over it when choosing your car, and that the bloom effect can sometimes hide barricades.Gameplay is simple and fun. It doesn't take much to get used to the controls, though in my experience steering can become wonky when you have to abort a drift. A major issue, though, is that the track generator has a bad habit of placing barricades right at the start of the loops, and of placing box trails and boosters in front of other barricades. This created ""Gotcha"" traps that you almost can't avoid when racing a track for the first time. If you are going for a high score, then it does stand to reason that you just memorize the placement of things on the track. But I feel it is a bit unfair to hit a ramp, only to see all too late that there is a barricade right where I'm landing. Or to reach a loop and have about half a second to veer to the side to avoid a set of barricades. For scoring points, the game heavilly rewards drifting and staying in sync or super sync with the song. The jumps and boxes do add to the score, but most of the times I've beaten someone elses high score, it was because of me drifting more than they did. The physics work fine for the most part. I have been turned around after a roll jump a few times, but not often enough that it was irritating.For the music, the tracks bundled with the game are okay. There is an issue there, though, if you shoot for achievements, as not all of the genres are covered by the bundled tracks. The game relies on Last.fm to determine tracks. But the detection isn't perfect, and for songs that aren't mainstream, like anything from OCRemix or the Newgrounds Audio Portal, the detection is useless. Songs from those sources are usually are mis-labled. In what way, I don't know, as the game doesn't tell you what genre the song falls under, and there are only three color schemes thus far: green for hip hop and funk, blue for dance and classical, and red for rock and metal.I do have a complaint about a couple of secrets in the game, in that there are zero in-game hints on how to unlock those secrets. Unless you spoil yourself buy looking on forums and discussions, you would have to be lucky to stumble across them.One thing I would like to see is something to spend coins on after all vehicles and their paint jobs are bought. Because that all coins are used for.All in all, for just being a bit of a bare bones early access game, I feel it is worth it to buy this game. Unless the devs try to fix things that aren't broken, it can only get even better from here.4/8/2016 EDIT: The white spots are gone as of the latest update.			",22,1,1,4,2,0,0

Here In My Car, I'm Outdritin' 'Em All!Riff Racer = Audiosurf + Forever Drive + UNEXPLAINABLE HOMICIDAL RAGEIf you've played both Audiosurf and Forever Drive, I've pretty much just explained the game to you and if you like those two things just shut up and spend your money.For those unititated, this game is about generating a sort of race track/obstacle course based on your music, and playing through it in order to acheive a high score.  The primary appeal is seeing what kind of ride experience you get based on the song you pick.  Sometimes a track will fit SO perfectly to a song that you'll swear it was handmade and not randomly generated.  Other times you'll have a hard time discerning how your race and the song match up at all, but still find it enjoyable.In the case of Riff Racer, it places emphasis on the racing action and feels very much like a simplistic stunt racing game with pleasant, neon visuals.  The hook here is the fact that when you select a song that no one else out there has yet played, you generate a unique track that is FOREVER YOURS.  So anyone else out there choosing that song will race the track that YOU generated.  It adds a bit of a layer of discovery to the game, as well as interesting emergent competition.See...  This is where I have you tell you I just spent over an hour on a track based on ONE song.  ONE SONG.  Replaying it over and over.  Why...?Well, here I was picking songs that I both liked and thought were just eclectic enough to not have been played.  ...BUT I KEPT RUNNING INTO THIS ONE JAGOFF THAT HAD ALREADY LAID CLAIM TO THEM.  ONE GUY WHO JUST HAPPENED TO LIKE A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT SONGS THAT I LIKE AND WAS TRYING TO STEAL THEM FROM ME HOW DARE YOU SIR?!!?!Naturally, there was only one thing to do...Crush this pretender, cast down his claim to those musical lands, and claim the No. 1 Headband.It seriously sparks some sort of weird obsessive competition when you run into these scenarios.  It's kinda like when two scenesters that each think they are (bandname)'s biggest fan clash, and then the fur really flies!It's strange because otherwise this is one of those games that is chill as it gets.  Cruise through your music (Or even your podcasts!) and enjoy the visuals and cool Tron-like vehicles OR experience keyboard-smashing rage as you get freaky possessive about your special snowflake music!Start your engines if you... Loved the Audiosurf games.  Pretty much a must have for your collections. Like games that are trippy like woah! Have a bizarre need to defend your favorite songs as if they were your waifu.Put it in park if you... Are more so into DDR-style games.  This game is about mastering the drift, not the beats. Need couch co-op and the other plethora of features found in Audiosurf.  This game is currently pretty slim in that regard. Don't really listen to music that much.  Sure this is a stunt racing game, but a lot of the fun is seeing what kind of race track your favorite songs might make.The Bottom LineRiff Racer does what it does very well and with an even coat of polish.  I've dumped about five hours into it mostly in one sitting without even realizing it.  Not many games can claim to have that hold on a person.  It definitely carries that ""one more turn"" effect, only it's ""just one more song"".That said, there is definitely room for improvement.  The track visuals really need expanding, as even the different color schemes end up feeling alike to one another.  More game modes, local co-op, more items, powerups, and track terrain would cement this game as a classic.As it stands, it's definitely worth your money as is...  AND STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM MY TRACKS!			",146,39,2,20,9,1,16

												Think of it more as a music than a racing game. This game offers a great way to rediscover your music collection. The tracks created from your metal songs will be vastly different from the ones created from your ballads. The latter will be chill and relaxing while the former will test your skill and reaction. In the default mode you won't have to worry about gas/brakes, the game will take care of that for you. However, you can turn this off, if you prefer to manage it yourself. The skill is mostly in collecting boost-items, avoiding obstacles, timing your boosts and most importantly, drifting the curves efficiently. The car models (bought for in-game currency) have identical driving characteristics except for the hit box.I adore this game, I had so much fun under my headphones listening to my favourite songs and discovering the tracks they would ""create"". It makes you appreciate your music in a new way, as you pay 100% attention to it as well as creating a visual representation.			",696,291,50,135,119,6,154

												A great game to to just kick back to while listening to your favourite tracks. If you're someone like me who tends to just get lost into their music, this is a great alternative to be actually ""participating"" with it instead of just doing nothing while going through a playlist. Although if you're into bass heavy tracks with high beats per minute, you may notice that at times it seems as if the track is properly designed for it, since you'll be listening to heavy kicks but with not as much action on screen. Aside from that, it goes great with other tunes and at times it does feel as if the track is part of the song, getting quick and intense right as the music is picking up its pace.It's worth full price, but if you get it on sale for around $3 like I did, go for it. If you're a fan of audiosurf or any other melody type game and drifting, this is the perfect combination.			",42,4,4,5,5,0,4

								DAT is a very promising game in Early Access that has a lot of potential and is fun to play, combining the addictive competitive/completionistic drive of a timed course run with the auto-generation based off from your music. While the concept of using music is similar to AudioSurf, the mechanics provide a different core gameplay experience that is enjoyable in a different way closer towards trackmania and other course speed runs.I am hoping for more themes/environment and track styles myself but time will tell.

								Pretty damn good, I think. Has some issues with a few things, but overall a great game. A few of the issues I've noticed are:The game will sometimes place barriers right after a reverse loop-de-loop (so you're driving on the outside of the track), with no way to see the barriers before you hit them.The way it chooses genre for songs is a bit weird, too. It thought a dubstep song was a metal song, for instance.			",228,33,12,13,9,2,23

								I've played a couple of hours of this and I'm really liking it. I love to listen to music and to play games, and I love car games, so this is the perfect combination of things I enjoy. The track generation is very good, and the devs seem to listen to the community. If you're one of those people who buys Early Access games hoping to get something enjoyable, then you won't have any issues with this game. The core game is there, allowing you to have hours of enjoyment. With further updates I'm sure more features will come to increase the value of what you're getting.I'd really recommend this if you love music based games like me. There is more game to it than audiosurf and because you're able to use any song the replay value is limitless.			",283,46,21,40,45,8,35

								I've been waiting for someone to make a game like this since the day I played Audiosurf. It's a great premise, race the track itself, trying to stay ahead of the music. It even has friend ghosts. I'm a big fan of Melody's Escape but I think this might be  rapidly becoming my music game of choice.			",237,104,17,64,66,8,49

								Enjoy the gme to kill time every now and then, I see this to have potential to be something amazing but for the time being its more like a glorified app game.Pros:-Your music, cant complain about the sound track.-Driving is very kid friendly (also a con but this makes the game reach out to a wider audiance)-Visually intresting to look at, like that windows media player stuff. but a world of it.Cons:-As of right now, no multiplayer( I invited my friends to play and while they have the game, no racing together)- Cant share or temporarily share tracks or music, (this is my biggest gripe for I phsically have to send my friends my music files just so they can race my ghost. )- Cant experiment with songs, (Your playlist is your game. Even though i can see charts of other people, I have no idea whats floating around me.)I assume this is probably all in the works anyways which is why I'm guna recomend this game. But If your left only to yourself I would say this game is just a glorified app.			",32,9,4,1,1,0,0

												Hey!  You've got my music in your video game...no worries...it makes for a delicious treat.I have thoroughly enjoyed playing this game.  The achievements are doable, and there is a sense of reward actually ""playing"" your music and not just listening to it while you play.  There are ample cars and a decent variety of tracks.  I would like to see more development along the lines of track options, performances/stunts that you can do, or options/enhancements for your cars.  I would also love to see true multiplayer options or ability to challenge other players directly.  However, as it is it has enough enjoyment to last...partly because it is a fun way to listen to your music and enjoy a racing game.BTW, I created a group for the game to possibly serve as a community focus for challenges, suggestions of songs or song resources apart from the general discussion forum.  :-)Riff Racer Group ",55,15,3,7,11,3,11

												I really enjoy Riff Racer. I find the gameplay to be very relaxing, and a good way to blow off some steam. I also love the idea of using your own music to make a level. I have enjoyed other games like Melody's Escape that visualize my favourite songs for me, so I really enjoyed it in Riff Racer as well. There is a wide variety of unlockable cars and skins, so you will find one that will suit your tastes easily. Sadly, they are all the same gameplay-wise, but at least they look nice. One thing I did have an issue with is the visuals. While they are beautiful, sometimes they make seeing the road ahead difficult. Also, a minor nitpick, but I really didn't like the pre-packaged music that comes with the game, however you may really like the songs, and will likely find yourself playing your own tracks anyways.

												This game.. oh boy. Such a simple concept. Pick any of the music on your own PC and go. But it generates the tracks for you based on the songs  composition. Be it the rifts of a sweet guitar lick, the change of  tempo or pitch can lead to some sweet synchronization for the track, be it a loop or a hella big jump.But the best part of all this really is the fact that its your OWN music. Your favourite music. A great way to just sit down, put on some tunes. I used to just sit and let youtube do its thing and stare mindlessly at the screen while track played one after the other.But at least with Riff Racer, I can engage the music, and have a blast while jaming out.Also, extra points for a game that works best with metal and fast guitar/drums instead of high tempo techno-esc music all the time.Highly recomended.

								Drive Any track is a replacer for Audiosurf and gives you the feeling of need for speed, just on a single road to YOUR own playlist or mixes. Your playing with different cars, which you can modify. It gives a more fun experience than audiosurf with a car, drifting, crazy jumps and similiar content from Distance, where the maps are created by the track your playing. Even so the game supports song length from mixes, which i tried. Overall controls and car control is good. Surely it's a similiar idea, but the experience was different.. Even you're getting surprised how insane the tracks can be.Here is my experience with the Gramatik album BP1: http://www.twitch.tv/theearlyaccess/v/7441866 ",320,27,7,19,27,2,19

								I have a soft spot for music games, especially those that used your library of music. A friend of mine knew that and lead me to this game. I have to say, I'm suprised that it's this good, considering that I like to try and dodge anything early access. So, on with the game.The game is well designed, the visuals are interesting as well as flashy, without being overwelming. The driving in this game works well, but seems a tad uninteresting, due to it seeming a bit like audiosurf without it copying it. The cars you can choose are all varied and come with extra skins, so you can find something that suits you.My only real gripes with the game are a lack of choosable difficulty levels, which is bad because sometimes due to choices in music, especially when the mixing of certin songs can be iffy at times. There are also times on the songs where you can't really dodge the walls coming your way, due to jumps that make you land on them, and due to the camera not letting you see downward a little more when jumping.It's worth buying though, and I'm glad I grabbed it when i did.

								It's early days for DAT but what I've played so far has a lot of promise.The biggest issue now is track parsing is still being tweaked - that means when you choose a track it will often be considered 'new'/there are no high-scores available.  Upside is it's easy to get the 'create new tracks' achievements but it does reduce the competitiveness of it right now.Otherwise it looks and plays well - there's a mix of skill and memorisation required to get really good scores but I think some tweaking of the scoring system to allow skill to balance-out memorisation would be nice (e.g. a big drifter should be able to match the player who knows every wall/box?)I've already had more fun than I ever had with Audiosurf - DAT seems more promising - so I'm looking forward to what's coming next!!

												Fun, exciting, infuriating(Because my OCD kicks in whenever I dont get 100% sync) and otherwise a good game. Its name is Riff Racer which might imply that its best in combination with Rock/Guitar play, but in reality it works well with most genres I've tried so far. I have had the most fun with EDM and D'n'B, when the BPM gets high stuff gets crazy, and managing to land those jumps and slide through corners makes for a really fulfilling and rewarding feeling. I'd wish the colour-scheme was mixed-up a bit more, it uses different colours based on what type of track you are playing (Orchestral-green, Rock-red, and so on) so if you are a big fan of rock you will find yourself looking at red and blue colours 90% of the time.

								Disappointed with the algorithm's results in generating tracks. I tried a variety of songs from Kavinsky, La Roux, Miracle of Sound, Iron Maiden, Johnny Cash, and Tom Waits. What I got bore little resemblance to what I was listening to. The country got the most intense tracks surprisingly. It won't be replacing audiosurf for me without a lot of work, but I will keep my eye on it.

												Riff Racer is a great game for any music lover.  I always listen to music before I go to sleep, so being able to combine music and a racing game is great.  Compared to similar games like Audiosurf (which is also very enjoyable), Riff Racer has only one mode, but the driving is more akin to a real racing game.  The car can move across the entire racetrack, which is dotted with barricades, jump ramps, and boost cubes.  The driving itself is simple in concept, but challenging to master.  The main mechanic is drifting, which is my favorite part of the game.  Trying to push your luck to get a long chain is nerve racking and exhilarating.  High scores do not come easy, which adds to the fun.Positives:-Race tracks correspond extremely well with songs -Can play on edited songs-Drifting mechanic is very exciting once you get a hang of it -A very competitive communityNegatives: (Although I call them negatives, these are more nick-picks than anything else)-Some tracks can be frustrating in the positioning of ramps and barricades.  When I find these tracks, I just fight through and move on-The barricades can sometimes be unavoidable since you cannot see them after a jump or they blend into the color of the track -The user interface is a little wonky with a controllerOverall, Riff Racer is very enjoyable and worth a try.

												Coming from Audiosurf, I thought this game would be the same exact thing with the only difference being it's with cars.This is mostly true, but there are differencesThis game requires a little more concentration and planning than Audiosurf does. Occasionally the path might get narrower and you have to be extra cautious and not hit the wall. There's ramps, which if executed poorly will throw you off the stage. They even let you change your car, and the colors too! Plus, the backgrounds change depending on which genre of music you're doing.As with Audiosurf I can boot up any song from my computer, wheter its an iTunes file or something somebody sent me on a thumbdrive. Everything works well, I havn't spotted any bugs or glitches or anything going wrongOne complaint I have, and this is particular to me and those like me. I'm a fan of prog rock, which is a genre that contains many songs which last for several minutes, say 15-20, with exceptions. For whatever reason this game can't run songs that are longer than 12mins (Longest song I've been able to do lasted about ten and a half minutes). So theres a good chunk of my music that I can't use because the game can't comprehend something of that size. Audiosurf can do that no problem, unless you get bored 15mins in and want to quit, of course.UPDATE: Game has multiplayer mode. Have yet to try it, and thus cannot comment on it. Sorry  :(Beyond those things, this is an excellent game, worth giving a try if you like music, cars, video games, and steam achievements			",54,8,4,7,15,2,1

												This game is amazing. Listening to music that you want and able to ride with it. Custom cars? Damn they have that too. Only dislike is the red triangle of death. Other then that the game cool even if the stages don't go with the music your music is playing in the background, how many games let you have your choice of music??? MMMM?????????????? Developers hope you keep updating the game the best you can bc this crap is some good crap.			",38,3,1,4,1,0,2

The in-game file browser simply does not display the music m4a file to play anymore. (Which is literally all of my music on itunes...) And because of that, This game is now worthless to me.

								I thought I'd write a review, as this game is something else to me.I bought it on sale for £4.39 and definitely have not regretted it. It has unlimited playability due to any song being compatible, but bearing in mind if you have no songs you can't play (perhaps the Devs could include 1 or 2 intro songs). As for the actual syncing with the music, it does a fairly good job, some of them are really well done to go into the loops on the drops and things, and some of them aren't as well synced but are still fun to play (However my music is primarily Rock/Metal so for Dance etc I think it may be better).All in all I'd say this is a 9/10 then with a few tweaks it'll be there - If you're a fan of music then buy it:)			",41,6,2,3,10,2,7

								  This game is awesome. The idea of racing on tracks based on music on your computer is something new and unique. The algorithm that Drive Any Track (DAT) uses to generate the tracks has potential. It can be hit-and-miss sometimes, though. But, when it works it's awesome. I believe that the algorithm DAT uses is called MEGA. Like I said, it has potential. It needs to be refined a little, but, it works pretty well. Although, MEGA seems to work better with certain generes of music (or certain songs). Tracks based on rock can be iffy, but, some songs work better than others.  I'd recommend this game to people that like racing games and music. Even though songs over ten minutes can't be turned into tracks, it's still worth a try. Plus, it works with the format that iTunes uses for music, so, any iTunes music you have should work (as long as it fits the forementioned ten minute time limit).                                                                      I give Drive Any Track a 9/10.			",15,5,11,3,17,0,3

								I seldom review games, but considering that this is an early access game that I ended up enjoying quite well, I'll do the thing.I picked up this game on an impulse after seeing it as a suggestion from the Lunar New Year sale, just today actually. I've already almost spent four hours playing this game straight. It's like Audiosurf mixed with Trackmania, that is to say it is a music game that preloads any song in your library and bases a racetrack off the song you plug in using specific algorithms. Some of the ways they incorporate drops for example, in the form of a long jump, or utilizing loop de loops as a target point in the song are spot on. Other times, it leaves a lot to be desired. There were songs that I feel had a lot going on, such as several hardcore songs which featured lots of heavy bass, which were only rated a one star. Other pop songs were rated a five. Just found it weird in the rating system and how the algorithm takes certain songs is all.However, is this game addicting and fun? Hell yeah it is. I find this a lot more fun and engaging than Audiosurf and there is so much promise in this game, especially for an alpha build. I look forward to following the progress of this game.

								This is what happens when you merge Audiosurf and Outrun, you get this unique music generated racing game.While the gameplay is ok so far and the graphics aren't flashy enough that would cause seizures (Which is a good thing), there are some knick knacks that I want to pick out.1, Steering can be a bit stiff at times, makes it easily smashed into a barrier or at the side of the walls.2. While Ogg is supported, the VORBIS ID is not, coming up with a warning that it doesn't support ID3 which is a bit riddiculous. Maybe they'll get around to supporting the VORBIS ID later in future releases.3. Keeping with the file formats, apart from Mp3 and Ogg, I'm not too sure if it'll support Wma or even Aac files (Especially ones that are DRM protected), right now I know that it doesn't support Flac files but maybe later on it will.4. I encountered a bug where the track is generating but it's in a loop, due to the dropout of the internet at my end.All and all, this is pretty good for an early access game, hopefully they'll iron those bugs out.

								What Audiosurf should have been.14 hour in update:Ok so this game is pretty good.  The drifting needs a little tweaking as it will randomly lose drift depending on your arrow key movement in the opposite direction.  However, it may also stay drifting despite the opposite press and throw you into the wall.  The difficult also needs a bit of a tweak as the game loves to throw multiple hard left hard right curves in a row and you will meet the wall without extremely fast reflexes.You'll get thrown into the wall either way.  However, the drifting also feels very tight and requires you to trust the car.  Once you get the hang of it, you can easily drift, hit the boost, and gain that x10 multipler and subsequent massive points with little effort.  Really looking forward to the full release and will definitely play more of this game.			",116,2,1,12,2,0,3

Its really competetive when you find a popular song and replay it again and again until you're number 1.(p.s. play a song called: Through the fire and flames by DragonForce - this song is difficult as hell)Got up to rank 3 on: THrough the FIre and flames, lost it within an hour, at this point i've given up...I'm super addicted and i really don't know why, for such a simple game it's so much fun.

And it's only in Alpha state.Get this now if:You like listening to music.You like racing games.You like racing games while listening to music.Now you can do both at once.  I thank the developers for saving me valuable time.  How crazy that I used to do both of those things seperately. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I love this game so much. It's very creative in the works of how it uses the music to create a literal track for you to drive on. The graphics are very nice, and the gameplay is short and sweet - it certainly keeps me busy for a while, so I highly recommend getting it while it's still on sale.			",164,10,13,5,8,2,5

								I love listening to music, but am too ADHD to sit still and JUST listen to music. So I love games that let me get some use out of my MP3 collection. Although still in Early access at the time of this writing, Drive Any Track's core mechanics seem pretty well developed. My only complaint is that the visuals get kind of repetitive. While I love the neony Tron look, a  little more variety in backdrops, sky boxes, and track dressing would be nice. If they patched in some Wipeout-ish hovercars and maybe some different game modes, I wouldn't complain. Anyway, great game, for $15. Replay value is limited only by the size of your music collection.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								My first impressions of this game are: F*cking buy it.You like driving? checkYou like hearing music? checkJust buy it.This game is inspired by audiosurf, it took the same concepts of ""riding"" your music, but instead of going in a straight line you  have to face corners and drift. The game is good it just need refinements with the driving and make the tracks more variable (More things in the background, different corners, etc..) ((I realy hope they add a lot of sh¡t in the background kind of like audiosurf)). Great game.			",300,24,23,26,13,3,38

								THIS IS AN AMAZING LITTLE GAME. It's algorithm is great. There are a few bugs left, but bear in mind it's not quite out of early release as of this review. The drifting does not contain the ability to chain left and right, but that's minor. The tracks generated tend to blow my mind with accuracy to song. To be honest I also use this for audiobooks. It keeps my attention span up. Even in early access, the community for this game is active and helpful. If you're reading this during the winter sale, BUY IT NOW. BOTTOM LINE.

												Riff Racer is an addictive racing game that oozes the feeling of arcades of yore. The racks all look very samey BUT the layout of them is based on the song. The game has a handful tracks built in, but the real meat is when you start importing your own sick beats from your music library and race the night away!Verdict: It's fun, fast, sleek and addictive as all holy hell.

												This game uses bumping music, bright effects, and music generated tracks to create an awesome experience that will keep you coming back for more. The cars that you use to race on the rhythm road are also nicely made with boost gauges attached right to the back, which is a cool way to keep your boost info available.

												Riff Racer is all I could've wanted out of the play-your-own-track subset of the music game genre. Here are a couple of things that the game pulls off really well:You can get plenty of playtime out of it if you have a somewhat sizeable music library sitting in your hard drive. Even if I hadn't picked the game up when it wasn't on sale, I would say it is still very much worth it if you don't want to wait simply for the sheer amount of time you can just spend playing track after track. Useful for people like me who have a good thousand albums sitting around that I haven't gone through, it gives me a bit of motivation to do so, especially considering that the game incentivizes play with in-game currency that you attain from just playing your tracks, used to unlock new cars and paint jobs.The game isn't particularly mechanically dense, but this really works in the game's favor. It's all score based rather than having you drive a closed circuit racetrack. What this essentailly entails is auto-acceleration being on by default and a big focus on manipulating your boost and doing tricks all the while driving clean to attain the best score multipliers, rather than trying to go as fast as you can as per any orthodox racing game. After all, you finish your ""track"" as soon as the song ends. There aren't that many tricks, but there is a skill involved in it, gathering boost boxes scattered on the track, knowing when to drift, to roll your car instead of just jumping normally, for example.The logic for ""track"" creation is very slick. I've only had a few songs where a blockade obstacle was placed unfairly, like at the start of a loop where I couldn't see it, but for the most part, it's great and really does pick out set-piece moments in your songs. The difficulty also varies from song to song, though sometimes the hardest songs are the ones you wouldn't expect. I've had drone music play at the highest difficulty and some high-tempo noise rock play on the easiest.The game is simple in its appearance and polygonal car models, but the colorful neon-laden tracks are easy on the eyes and easy to just get lost into a trance to when I try to pull off drift after drift. It's a great visualizer, which is a good thing to have for a game like this. It's never boring to look at, especially since the colors of the tracks vary depending on what genre of music you're playing.Here are a couple of things that the game could improve on in the future (as it is getting updates here and there).The leaderboard and social aspects of the game are just serviceable. You have a player profile page, but there isn't much to see on it. You can see what car you use most, what track you play the most, and that's about it in terms of useful information. Trying to see what tracks a friend has played, for instance, will only yield their most-played track. Along with this, despite using Last.fm as a basis for determining track genres, as far as I know, you don't have the ability to scrobble your tracks. This one's just a minor nitpick of mine, but still, both of these potential features are things Audiosurf had in spades over Riff Racer, and I'd really like to see it worked on.The only game mode you have here is the score-based one. There's no other way to play it, but what the game has to offer is still a lot of fun.Japanese unicode doesn't work and it just comes out as a bunch of question marks :(((Though flawed in some respects (which are just nitpicks on my part), Riff Racer is still, all-in-all, a really solid game. If I could describe it, I'd call it chill. The sort of chill where you just invite someone over and watch shows or movies in the dark while sipping something. Riff Racer's real chill to hang with. It's definitely worth checking out if you're into this type of game.			",205,35,4,17,11,0,27

												Riff Racer is a must-buy for everyone who likes rhythm based music games.The tracks that are composed aren't as irratic as Audiosurf's. Controls for the car work well. Visuals are great.When you play a song that no one has played, the game awards you for the cataloging the song with coins and your name being there as the author of the race track.Ghosts of previous racers to race with work pretty well to keep you competitive.The value is low thanks to it having been in a bundleThere are trading cardsGreat free bundled tracks.Overall8/10(Games start off from a 5/10 and increase/decrease in points with pros and cons)			",541,172,24,62,99,8,72

Early Access Review
								If you like Audiosurf, you will love this game. It was a frustrating start but after I practiced with the controls a bit, I do a bit better now. There are some great things and some not so great things so I will try to list them all.Great things: -Plenty of cars and paints for the cars.-Visually stunning.-Simple yet challenging. -Track variation is pretty good, although I have found a few songs where most of the song is just drifting back and forth which is quite boring. For the most part though, the tracks are pretty good.-Shiny! Not so great things:-If you have a downloaded song through YouTube or some other source, there is no leader board for that song.-Sometimes downloaded songs will play as a different songs-Barricades are placed in bad spots from time to time. Sometimes they are impossible to avoid unless you have the track memorized.-Visuals can become distracting if your eyes are sensitive to bright colors, flashes, and other such effects.-Controls are wonky. They just do not feel consistent. Sometimes they respond slow. Sometimes they are too twitchy (Example: pulling out of a drift will slam you into a wall) -Crate and token hitboxes are not consistent either. Sometimes you can drive right next to them and pick them up, other times they won't get picked up.-Lack of control customization and not being able to use mouse/gamepad. You cannot change controls. The controls consist of <- -> [spacebar] and CTRL. There was little tutorial too. I was unsure that I could drift until about my 20th race and then i got a tip saying CTRL was to drift.Overall, considering this is Early access, It is in pretty good shape. There are a few minor things that need to be changed/tweaked/added. But overall, it was worth the money. I would suggest this game to any music lover.			",83,2,2,11,3,0,6

Still a bit buggy - By this I mean there were several times where i was 100% in sync for the majority of the song, only to have it be messed up by my car randomly turning 180 degrees into the opposite direction after landing from a jump making me go several bars behind.2. No WMA format support - this might just be me being picky, but i would love it if i could play a lot of my music without having to run it through a format cinverter to get it to MP3.3. At times it can be a bit too easy.4.Not really a complaint but I would like more cars.All in all I still really like it and i bet most of my the things im complaining about can or will be fixed in future updates.7.5/10 ",47,1,6,11,2,1,1

												Since my main pc game is TF2, the controls took a little time to get used to. The genre categorizer is very good, although one dubstep song in particular[soundcloud.com] registered as a rock/metal song (probably cause all the bass) (I did like the special lighting for that song though). Drifting was a little hard to master at first, but it's very useful in some parts. The leaderboard/chart system isn't the most comprehensive in my opinion. I think the people who say this game is too easy missed the difficulty rating system. There are some tracks that you have to be next-level gamer demon to not destroy yourself in. On some tracks I've found there are very tight turns that can easily make or break a run, drifting or not. I noticed someone else said there's a 30 fps cap, but I've found this to be completely untrue (at least when you play on lowest resolution fullscreen). Overall a very good first release.

								Though I have only played a short time, as of this writing, I can already see the fun and enjoyment in this game. Overall for a early access release it is very polished and runs very smoothly. Looking forward to many hours racing around with my music in the background. Here is a first look review of the game that I created:

												Being a person who loves music, this game is great. Despite what others say the tracks do keep up with the songs I have tried (a few dubstep songs, a few alternative songs), while still being challenging. My only complaint? No live multiplayer! Whats with that?! Otherwise a great game you should really add to your library.			",13,1,3,0,4,0,4

												So I haven't been playing this for very long, but I've already taking a liking to it. From my own experience, it takes a little while to get a good grip on the handling of your vehicles, but that makes mastering it worth it (I find a controller is best for racing games like these). It can get pretty addictive rather quickly; especially if you're a fan of games where your music collection shapes the levels.All in all... I think I've found a good way to waste time for several more hours.			",11,2,2,6,1,0,0

												This is a score-based ghost racing game. You're not competing for the best time, but rather who can navigate the track in a manner that scores the most points (largely by drifting, collecting boosts, and hitting jumps right). The game has a meter that travels along the road and the car auto accelerates to keep up with it.The track generation feature works surprisingly well with most songs I've tried, and provides an added level of exhilaration to the climaxes of the music, even for more classical/orchestral songs. The game does not feature real-time multiplayer, but I don't see that as a downside, as it would be rather clunky without making a huge shift in game play. The biggest con to this game is the clunky slow menu and the fact that there's no way for strangers to race against the songs you upload unless they happen to have the same niche taste in music.

												To be honest, the tracks didn't sync great to the music. In essence, you're racing near identical tracks while listening to songs you like. If you want to listen to songs you like while racing in a sci-fi environment, go and get Distance. Honestly, that game syncs the surroundings with your music and the tracks are 1000x better, as well as having a level editor, and a workshop with a ton of tracks available.			",169,35,8,10,26,1,17

												Note: I received this game from a giveawayHonestly the most fun I've had with any racing game in a good while! I especially like that you can upload any song you want instead of having to just play whatever songs come with the game (although being able to play songs that you don't have on your comp would be cool too but it's fine as is)My only qualm is that with all the flashing that happens when you hit speed boosts it makes it hard for me to see the barriers/be able to tell them apart from ramps so an option to be able to turn it off would be neatBut other than that it's a lot of fun so far and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone that enjoys racing games			",205,53,5,16,30,2,12

												Well guys, that game is... Oh Lord so smooth. At first I was a bit sceptic, thinking the races (so... the songs) would really look the same. Then I bought it, jumped into it, and BOY THAT WAS UNBELIEVABLE. Some songs/races (I don't even know which one to chose) are incredible, mainly ones with a good BPM and pace. You really enjoy your music while playing. But, If I had to say something ""bad"" about this, it's the impossibility to rework some levels to make them fit even more with the music (i.e for rock songs, when it's the solo). That aside, this game is so damn awesome !			",37,9,1,2,2,0,1

												Much better than any of the Audio Surf games, and a lot more innovative than other games in the music/driving genre.As others have pointed out, the main goal is to keep up with -- or ahead of -- the beat. That's only the half of it, though. You augment your score by pulling off tricks, jumps and by drifting, thus the game rewards you for taking risks and embellishing your run instead of just rocketing straight through the track.There's also continuity in terms of collecting points, upgrading to newer (and better-handling) cars, etc. The cars are pretty sweet, with enough variety in the designs to offer something to everyone. There are muscle cars, classically styled cars, and sleek, angular vehicles that look like they've emerged through a time portal from 1985.This is a great pick-up, especially on sale.

												Not sure what to say about this. I always felt that Audiosurf pretty much ruled the ride your music scene and I think it does still, but this game right here has filled a different space... I never saw a reason why anyone else would make a game similar to what Audiosurf is, but Riff Racer is quite an experience! I don't get the same feelings as Audiosurf, I truly felt I was playing along with my music on that game, not this one but the tracks this game creates randomly for each song don't feel too out of touch with what is playing and the stunts are nice. Sometimes I feel the game gives certain songs the wrong difficulty rating, I'm not sure how it decides which one is 5 star and which is 1 star. I recommend this game based on that if you enjoyed Audiosurf, you might enjoy this one, it fills a different spot in the music-riding genre and does something Audiosurf doesn't which lets you collect coins to buy more cars!

												This is another 'play to your own music' game that revolves around drifting your car through corners, jumping off ramps, and avoiding obstacles. You'll be aiming for the highest score, rather than the fastest time. The drift physics are fun, though maneuvering around walls and over jumps is a little tricky.A song's difficulty is mainly based on its BPM (as opposed to frequencies or volume like you'd see in Beat Hazard and Audiosurf), which results in some cool pulsating backgrounds. But, before you get ready to unleash your speedcore collection on this game, keep in mind that the speed recognition caps at about 200 BPM, and anything over that usually gets wrapped back to 1 star difficulty. The tracks are somewhat dynamic, and loosely follow the intensity of the song as it goes.As for customization, you can unlock cars and different paint jobs, though every car drives in the same way as each other. There are leaderboards, too, and you can drift along with the replay of another driver if there is one. The game also has a nice system of notifying you in the game with its 'news' section when somebody beats your score, and you can go directly to the song from there to reclaim it.Honestly, I'm surprised a game with this premise could be made to begin with. For $10, I'd say the game is worth it. If you want a silly procedurally generated music game where you can drift a car around, this one is good.a			",17,3,4,1,6,0,1

 TL;DR - If you like casual/arcade racing games and Audiosurf, this is a no-brainer! Riff Racer (formerly known as Drive Any Track in Early Access) is a rhythm/racer fusion that takes your mp3 collection and generates a Trackmania-style racetrack based on the audio file.  If you are the first to play your mp3 (note: you need to have id3 tags on your mp3s), the game will enshrine you as the creator of the track for all of eternity!  You can race by yourself, or race against a ghost of another player who has driven the same song.  The driving mechanics are just ""ok"" in my opinion, I've played much smoother racing games.  However, this game should not be confused with a technical racer, it is definitely more of an arcade racer with rhythm game features mixed in.  You can utilize a decent selection of cars, and unlock at least a couple of hidden cars as well.  They have added some more customization options since the Early Access phase, but it is still not quite as fleshed out as what you'd see in other racing games.The rhythm aspects of the game are subtle but definitely there.  It's not quite as beat/rhythm focused as Audiosurf in terms of track pickups and obstacles, but the lights and colors of the track flash along with the beats and on certain drifts you can tap along with the beat to get the best result.  Overall, I'd give this game an 8/10.  It really excels on what it sets out to accomplish as a game, despite seeming bare bones in certain aspects that you'd be used to seeing in another racing game.  The game is truly as deep as your mp3 collection, much like Audiosurf, but the racing is enjoyable enough and ghost racing against a friend gets really competitive and fun :)If you'd like some gameplay footage, here's me racing against my good friend UncleDorky's ghost!

												   I really liked this game, it's fun and simple, there are no if's or but's about it. The controls are very simple, basic driving movement keys [Though default bound to arrows and not wsad] with the drift function being controlled from spacebar (Saints Row 3 anyone?) and a boost button for when you fill your boost meter, which is cleverly displayed on the car and not a HUD.   The cars themselves are many once you can afford them [W/ In-game coins found within songs] and the designs are radical but remnescent, fitting into the game world perfectly while maintaining styles that many of us should be able to recognize features of.  The tracks [Road/Highway] are very colorful, as anyone here who has played audiosurf will easily relate to, fitting the music in a good way, with little dancing pixels colorized and moving to the beat of the music. There are stright-ways, loops, jumps, and drift streches, all of which are pretty fun to drive on, all except the drift areas containing barricades you want to advoid. My biggest issue was jumping off the side of the track and hitting barracades while going for coins, but it was all fun, the gameplay isn't overly challenging and the cars are manuverable in air, making mistakes like that semi recoverable. This is  -not- Dark Souls DJ'ing on wheels, this is a fun game ment for everyone.  Coins end up being used for buying new cars and customization options for the cars you do own. You start off with one car that has one unlocked customization, a sporty design in a pretty blue. The songs seem to vary in coins amoung them, I had one song go as low as 90 coins and another up to 250. This does help keep the game a little more appealing since you end up setting goals for getting the cars and paints, though I am only left to wonder that if 250 coins per song is good, then cars and paints costing 20k+ would take quike awhile to get. You do level up as you gain experience points from each song and I can only assume higher levels gives higher coin multiplyers, but that is just my assumption and in no way should I ever be quoted on it.   I don't have any gripes, as much as I tried to find one. While I was playing with the truck I did see my truck reflecting off the truck, which... makes no sence... and I once had a spotlight-beam cross the road for a second, but the map is littered with spotlights, as well as many other eye glittering detail. I have not been able to have this issue reoccure since, even on the same song it appeared on. The only thing that I would like to see is a super drift mode, or maybe a split game from this using the same physics, as the drift portions are very fun and arcade-like. I suppose one can compain about car customization being basic, but in this game there is so many colors and lights that you really only get to fully appreciate your car paint job when not driving.   I'm a fan of arcade racing games and music games, audiosurf was the actual reason I made a steam account in the first place, and I now own sevral custom-music based games. With a game like this, I was only naturaly drawn to it once I saw it in the featured store page, and I haft to say, this game is worth it. Very worth it. It is fun, simple, and effective at staying just that. If you like music-based games, specialy ones that use your music, I would highly recommend this, even if you're not a driving-game fan. This game has its heart in the music, and that is something I can appreciate.			",127,14,8,32,10,0,8

												Not sure what to say about this. I always felt that Audiosurf pretty much ruled the ride your music scene and I think it does still, but this game right here has filled a different space... I never saw a reason why anyone else would make a game similar to what Audiosurf is, but Riff Racer is quite an experience! I don't get the same feelings as Audiosurf, I truly felt I was playing along with my music on that game, not this one but the tracks this game creates randomly for each song don't feel too out of touch with what is playing and the stunts are nice. Sometimes I feel the game gives certain songs the wrong difficulty rating, I'm not sure how it decides which one is 5 star and which is 1 star. I recommend this game based on that if you enjoyed Audiosurf, you might enjoy this one, it fills a different spot in the music-riding genre and does something Audiosurf doesn't which lets you collect coins to buy more cars! A nice feature indeed.			",118,3,1,7,6,1,2

Each song feels different, as it should (Unlike other games in this same genre). It is easily up to, if not beyond the genre standard. Great game.Overall 10/10.

												What interested me most about this game was drifting in sync to my music, which sounded like a match made in Heaven. There is a zen-like quality to drifting and chaining back to back corners that would seem to pair itself incredibly well to music based or 'rhythm' gaming. It took only a few minutes to realize that I would not be enjoying this game much at all. Unfortunately the 'drifting' is horrendous. I wasn't expecting too much, something akin to what is in a basic cart racing game. What ruins it is the complete lack of counter-steering. For those not familiar with counter-steering, it is the practice of turning your wheels opposite to the direction you turned to initiate the drift in order to maintain the cars balance to remain drifting instead of simply spinning out. It is the single most crucial aspect of drifting and Riff Racer misses it entirely. So what does this mean in terms of gameplay? It means that being able to guide your car and maintain a drift while sideways is effectively removed. You initiate the drift with a button press and then rely on the angle of your entry point along with your speed to remain drifting while continuing to spam the drift button. If you try to counter steer and maintain your drift the car immediately gains traction and sends you out of the drift and into the wall. It's a mind-boggling design decision that ruined the experience for me almost before it began.			",154,41,9,33,8,1,28

Early Access Review
								I really enjoy this game. Music has always been a strong passion of mine, I have always taken intrest in music games like Guitar Hero but once I found out about this game I was very excited and I bought it right away (I got it on sale for 6 bucks). I dont do too many reviews so my opinion shouldnt rock yours and influnce you to buy this game.PROS:-Track making system-Cool cyberpunk feel-Awesome looking cars-Very easy to pick up (as long as you have music)-Can make music without ID's into tracks (thats for all of you guys who download all your music off of youtube to mp3)-All genres make different tracks so its fun to expirment with that.-3 sexy easter egg cars that are awesome to try and unlock-Perfected and polished smooth leaderboard ghost racing systemCONS:-Graphics are cartoony and all the friends I have suggested this awesome game to have been turned down by that-Its in early acess and therefore it still lacks a ton of content-Track making system, the reason I put this one in both pros and cons is because some things (like volume, drops, etc) can screw up the tracks because it cant tell the difference between 1 or 2 beats every now and then so your dubstep drop or rap outro might be a little iffy (ignore it the devs are doing an amazing job at attempting to fix it)-No updates for the past while (last one was August 11th, 2015) as im writing thisMy verdict: 7/10This game is awesome and you should totally pick it up when you get the chance as you will have a tremendous amount of fun playing this. It is currently 16.99 CAD (which is not worth the game) so wait till it goes on sale.I hope this review helped you and ill see you out there on the tracks.If you want some gameplay here you go, I did this for a friend on my channel:

												I like the concept here, but I feel the implementation lacks a little too much for me to give a recommendation.What's good?The idea of racing against the music's cursor. The race track length is equivalent to the song length, and you need to maintain a certain velocity to stay on cue with the song's ""now playing"" position. It's simple and novel.The music, for the most part. is enjoyable and fits the game well.The ability to use your own music for tracks.Multiple cars to use (and unlock).When you get going really fast and lights on the track pulse to the music. That's when you really feel the flow and is the game's real sweet spot in my opinion.What's not so good?As far as I can tell, the game has just one track style (road texture, skyline, roadside decor, etc.) that it uses over and over again. Every song I picked, even ones auto-generated from my music looked nearly identical. It seems you get a palette swap at best, and even then, a vast majority of the palettes I saw varied from red to pink. To boot, it's very monochromatic (more on that later).The car designs overall are fairly simplistic. They do fit the theme, but it's not like more detail on the cars would clash with the game's visual design.The controls leave me hankering for more precision steering. Given that the game can be played with one hand, it'd be nice to have a button you could press to enter into a fine-precision-steering mode where you didn't steer so acutely. The nature of the race courses rarely call for that, and when they do, it's very tricky to not end up over-correcting.The game's procedural generation of courses is rather bland. As noted before, the style is already repetitively used. Beyond that, there's actually little to do within a course. You collect turbo boost points (which when you've collected enough, you can juice your turbo). You also collect coins to unlock cars in your garage. Outside of those you have blockades, speed boosts, and ramps. The course itself twists, turns, and has gaps for you to jump over. But it all seems like it's a bit sparsely laid out for the sake of avoiding bad combinations that could result from the procedural generation of race courses.I expected to have more of the gameplay and course design attached to some aspect of the music (like ramps right before bass drops or something akin), but there doesn't really seem to be anything like that except for the aforementioned aspect of having pulsing lights to the beat when you're going super fast. I know a feature like this wouldn't be easy, but it would really help create unique and memorable experiences on the race track.Another ramification of the lacking variations in track features and colors is that when you're going turbo speed, the game blurs the camera. Now the game often puts blockades and ramps side-by-side. So with blurred vision, high speeds, and coming about a ramp-blockade combo from blind turns/twists/hills, I found myself often hitting the blockade instead of the ramp in that situation. It's not an insurmountable challenge, but it's an example of where the game's lacking of design and variation creates difficulty where there should be none. Why aren't blockades just given a different color to clearly separate them from ramps?On a few occasions, I ran into poorly generated courses such as ramps right into curves. For a game that's hinging on its procedural generation to create replayability, it really could use a bit of tweaking/polish.I like the game, but there are a few obstacles in the way of me enjoying it for any considerable duration. It feels like it's within reach of being a great title for zoning out to with the right music selections. If racing and/or rhythm games are in your wheelhouse and you are curious what a combination of the two genres would be like, then this is worth a pickup. But in its current state, I wouldn't generally recommend this game to people.			",699,177,15,46,76,10,65

												""At last,"" the DAT(Riff Racer) came out of the early access, the gameplay has not changed, and it is so good, changed the colors on the cards at maximum volume is now impossible to listen to music, as heard a strong background. What do we see? Added 3 kinds of paint layers on each machine red green and purple, seriously? The best new painting only razor with some machines have removed a skin which was before all that I bought earlier, it is now conventional skins of one solid color, and all the ""new"" cost 7,500 coins, why? Yes, I like this game (you can tell - is the embodiment of my dreams come true), but to release it with a lot of bugs and such new rasskraska for machines you serious? This is a slap in the face of the community. At the moment I played enough 50 hours, and some of my tracks nebollaya vseravno does not start in the game, although they said that it is corrected. I can not recommend it for those who have already played, those who were waiting for the full release of the game, that's what we got. Well, if you just recently purchased this product, or want to buy it, you can safely play, game awesome, and did not look like Audiosurf, well-designed building cards to each composition, each composition has its own map, so it will not be uniform trips.My Verdict 6/10 I expected more...

												If you like music runner games, as well as racing games, well then hot damn do I have a game for you!The game seems to be a blend of the arcade-y, drifting-based handling of Ridge Racer, and the intense color pallette/vibing feel of Audiosurf, from what I can tell after about 2 hours of play.On the positive side of the game, it so far has accurately synced up with any song i've thrown at it's engine; the music-generated maps change color and theme depending on the genre of music/intensity of the current moment in the song, with the choices in theme being appropriate thus far; there are many options in the way of what your car looks like, with unlockable rides that you can further customize after purchasing, all using in-game coins earned through playing the game. Kinda sad that has to be a positive side of a game nowadays, huh? Anyways, the actual ""racing"" itself is done against the pace of the song by way of pace bars you need to try to keep up with to stay synced with the song; the drifting and speed of the game feel incredibly satisfying, with speed boosts placed at areas where the song picks up, or usually, when it goes into a chorus. Also there are spin jumps, which are pretty awesome...when you land them.Now for the negative sides, starting with what I last mentioned. Because the game has spin jumps, it has a sort of physics engine which the car operates on while midair, and while the game encourages you to do spin jumps to score more points, the car can very easily flip and leave you wiping out, resetting your position between the second and third bars. This could just be a case of ""i'm bad at the game,"" but it's rather irritating to lose your 100% sync rate because of something you have little control over; following up on that note, the game has barriers on the track that slow your car, which nine times out of ten, are completely avoidable. But sometimes you get that one time of the ten, where you can't see the barrier coming up because the track is going through a loop, and the song is ridiculously fast, so you get little to no time to react and lose a ton of speed. Again, could just be me being bad, but also again, it's not satisfying to get jipped out of your score because of that; the big complaint i've seen the most, no WMA support. Kinda lame, but it doesn't bother me personally too much, as most of my library is in mp3 format anyways, but I imagine that's a very large glaring issue for many people. Also, channeling my inner TotalBiscuit, the graphics options menu is limited to resolution, and fullscreen on/off, so if you can't run the game as is, you're kind of SOL. Sorry, yo.Overall, i've enjoyed the time i've put into the game, and I would recommend it to people who are fans of games such as Audiosurf, and Ridge Racer.			",260,37,9,41,16,2,22

												I dunno, it's just not really drawing me in. It feels like there's a great game hiding somewhere in this game, but wherever it is, it's likely far far down in the color-shifting landscape below the track.It has merit as an interactive music game, but I'd kinda rather just boot up Audiosurf or Beat Hazard if I'm going for that.The jumping mechanic... It's neat, but it feels really heavy. Like, it feels like the entire track is slamming down when you land. Also, it's really unsatisfying that even though you drive the same speed as the beat normally, if you boost ahead it can just catch up to you instantly. Makes me feel like I'm going nowhere.I'd call it not my type, but with the corollary that it is a decent game, and I don't want to shy other people away. Other people should check it out by all means. The only warning I'll give is that if you're going fast, the game will 100% conspire via color-shifting and blurring to make you unable to see obstacles until you hit them. Watch out for that.

												Its a good game, I got it from {LINK REMOVED} for 1,92 euros. Its awesome that you can ride a car on amazing beat, but this game misses something. I would like to ride and collect musical notes by my music beat, like audiosurf 2 and map skin would be nice, also if you could directly play music from youtube would be awesome too, but this game is okay.

												At its core, Riff Racer is a simple arcade style racing game. Because of this, it delivers its best experience when played on songs with fast tempo and strong beats. Heavy metal, rock, dance pop, and hype anime themes all synergize well with gameplay. For those looking for a more relaxing and visually impressive experience with their music, I recommend The Polynomial and The Polynomial 2. For those looking to just cruise and drift to jams, this is the game for you.Unfortnately, the game is currently lacking true multiplayer capabilities, and there is only a single color palette used for the track. If multiplayer ever gets supported, and different track visuals are relased, this game could push itself past games such as Audiosurf.			",98,5,1,11,0,0,3

												This is really hard to put a thumbs down because theres no neutral option while the game isnt too bad I find it lacking.This game feels kinda like a phone game even though as far as I know its not and im not trying to say it is I just mean it feels shallow and looks and feels like a good phone game. The drifting is arcade like but when you play it it kinda geels like a phone game and the jumps and barriers just scream phone game and thats where it really fell apart for me. I know audio surf would feel about the same but it dosnt really feel like youre playing a track bassed on your music, I can see the beats kinda show up on the ground and a few other things but its too undwellming for any of that to matter it and losses the point of the game at that point.You can most likely refund the game in under 2 hours of play time but by then you would know how the game feels and if you would actually enjoy it.

												Riff Racer is a game were you can pick a song from your computer and play it (which I'm pretty sure you already knew).This game kind of reminds me of AudioSurf but the graphics are improved and that you're driving a car instead of a spaceship. I played the game back in 2015 (when it was called Drive Any Track) and I couldn't be bothered to review it until now. Overall, awesome game and I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes games that are based around music.10/10			",113,11,15,3,9,0,2

												Riff Racer (Previously known as Drive Any Track) is a racing game where the tracks are generated using your very own .mp3 files on your computer. I must say that this is an amazing concept! The tracks goes at the sync of your songs really well. Its impressive! It works especially very well with video game music.The graphics aren't the best graphics of our era, but they fit very well with the game. The interface is very simple and easy to use, which is excellent. I dont have anything to say about the sound. I mean, it's YOUR music, right? I'm not here to judge your musical preferences.I do have some issues with the gameplay. Yes, the track generation fits very well with your songs. There are achievements and even unlockable cars. Though, my only problem with the entire game is the driving. It's really difficult. The cars are very difficult to control, and turning your car is slow! It can be very difficult to avoid obstacles with that kind of steering, because Riff Racer is also a fast-paced game! Even if you have a lot of experience with racing games, you'll have a hard time when it comes to driving. Though, its not impossible to drive the cars, they're completely drivable. But what I am trying to say is that the driving NEEDS to be made easier. But overall, if you love music, if you love driving games, this is a must-have. While the game does have its problems, Riff Racer remains an amazing and enjoyable experience. It'll make you want to listen to more music!			",445,57,47,23,36,6,23

 Riff Racer  is a car driving game which take your own music tracks, in your Library on PC and transform them into racetracks .Each racetracks is randomly created by the song you load.You have customization in the car as well, you can buy new cars and car styles with the coins you gain by racing before.The graphics are simple but colourful and beautifull wich attracts the eye.The gameplay is quite simple, you use the arrow keys, the space bar and  shift.Its a good game for casual players or music enthusiasts cause you can play a game with your soundtrack, and that ladies and gentlemen... is awsome :D			",40,7,1,5,2,0,6

								It's shiny and very well-polished for an early access title, but it just doesn't feel like a rythm game. Pickups and elements on the track may be in sync with the music, but the actual control inputs required to drive the course aren't. Overall the driving seems too simplistic and there isn't enough to do in the game. Precision-timed and challenging inputs are staples of rythm games, but this has neither - it's more like a basic arcade driving game where the boost pickups happen to go to the beat of your music.

												This game has a lot of potential and it could've been really fun, but it just isn't.The controls are extremely difficult to get use to, it's almost impossible to drift for more than 1 second, the game doesn't really feel like it's effected by your music when your playing, and the game completely butchers any sound that has bass to it. For example, if you were to play a dubstep song (since they have a lot of bass) or perhaps a trap song, it will sound like a distorted mess. The game just can't handle any bass for some reason. A lot of the odd curves and twists will just send you into a wall or will end with a ramp without giving you enough reaction time ultimately leading to you flying off of the track and into the abyss. The vehicle customization is very frustrating. At first from the trailer, I thought you immediately started the game being able to using everything you want right off the bat. Nope. You have to buy all the cars AND each individual ""paintjob"" for it, since there is no real customization like I was expecting. Earning money is also annoying. Everytime you start a new song you haven't played before, it will award you with 100 credits(?). Typically you earn between 100-150 in one song. The problem is cars will cost somewhere between 1,000-10,000. The cars (at least in my opinion) don't have a very great default paintjob, so you will try to get another one. Instead of them being free, the paintjobs on the very starter car are between 1,000-7,500 (if my memory is correct). The biggest problem I have with this ""buy to unlock"" system is that it makes playing the game feel more like a greedy race where every time you miss money, you can't help but to think ""♥♥♥♥!"" while you slam into a wall 3 seconds later. Not to mention about half of the money pickups you get don't even register. It just feels like an eternity to finally get enough money to buy something. The whole ""relax and play"" concept is just out the window for this game, which was a thing that made games like Audiosurf fun and kept you playing and wanting to try different songs.I really want to like this game but there's just too many problems right now. I'm probably going to refund this game, but I won't mind buying this game again if these problems are fixed.			",193,19,3,12,10,1,4

												It is not building the tracks around the music. You can not feel any influence of the music other than the background music. Further, there are so many bad design choices. Blurring and reddening the screen and obscuring hazards makes the game impossible to play properly. Further, the fact that you cant adjust your drift when drifting ruins the one thing that felt ok with this game.Go back to audiosurf if you want music based trcks. This one is just a bad racer with selectable background music.			",326,129,6,38,32,3,28

												Audiosurf meets Ridge Racer/F-Zero (depending on your music.) It controls a little floaty but I'm used to that kind of thing. My only complaint is there's no info for controllers in the controller menu (but if you've played a racer, the controls are obvious.)8/10 (Great game) I can't wait to see what these guys add as the months go by.Accessibility review: VERY large fonts, pretty good contrast (the pace bar will be a big help to colorblind players) and keyboard controls are rebindable. Unfortunately, there are no rebindings for X360 controllers as yet but, all in all, it's pretty accessible for most. Even deaf people can have fun with it if they know what to look for in music selection. Colorblind people should watch some videos to see if they'll be able to handle it.7/10 (Very accessible) Large fonts, rebindable keyboard, non-rebindable controller, and minor colorblind issues.

												The aesthetic is pretty well realized -- but then, so was Audiosurf's. The track generation is even less discernibly linked to the music you're playing it to. There's only one mode of play available, but I could forgive that and just have fun with racing the ghosts if the controls weren't a steaming heap of buttery garbage. Simply shifting left or right on a straight stretch of track SHOULDN'T be an effort of such gargantuan proportions, but it is. You're stuck with either finessing yourself in such small increments that you'll be unable to avoid what you're trying to half the time, or oversteering and INSTANTLY spinning out and smashing your dumb nose directly into the track boundary.Of course, the controls are the only real element of challenge the game has next to the procedural generation semiregularly producing horrible camera angles or impossible segments of track.I got it for about a dollar and was unimpressed. I almost like it, but it's too bare-bones and rough around the edges to recommend.			",611,127,18,38,40,4,51

												The game has a great concept but a terrible execution. I tried many different songs but they all were the same with a few added in barricades and ramps. The controls for steering and drifting are too rough for me, who enjoys racing games. I got this when it was on sale for 3.40$ and I would keep it but I can't see myself continuing to play it.

								It's not a bad music game, load up your music and drive a track that syncs to your music, Only problem is the developers have yet to add WMA support. More than a few people have asked for WMA file support among others but the developers have yet to address this. So, this means if you have a large library of files that aren't supported you are stuck with either not playing or using a converter. Which is silly. Other than that, the game is fairly regularily updated and they are adding new stuff all the time. But until they add more file type support, i'm not going to recommend this game for now. However it's still worth a score of 7/10 from me.			",318,42,20,32,53,2,69

								I know I didn't play long now (0.8 hours), but please read through it.I played Dragonforce - Through Fire and Flames -> really good track.After that I tried another Dragonforce Song from the same album and almost the same speed: Revolution Deathsquad.This track was god damn awful... The algorithm that ""scans"" the songs to make the track doesn't seem to work on every Rock or Metal song. Don't know why but it seems Through Fire and Flames was precrafted, cause they knew it would be played.Some other Rock Songs like Black Ice from AC/DC were the same, far too slow in drive speed. Songs that go good with this game are Dance or Techno Tracks, like Anamanaguchi - Endless Fantasy or from the same album Prom Night.Don't really know right now how I feel about this. Probably will write another review or edit this one.			",594,163,6,74,61,1,75

								It was a neat idea and I got it on sale for $6.  The driving in it was fairly boring to me.  If there was drifting I couldn't tell.  It felt extremely arcadey(and this coming from someone that enjoys NFS).  I was having a bug where keys I was pressing would get stuck and I would have to alt tab out of the game then back in to fix it, it may have been because I was playing in full screen.  It's possible it could have been from the mouse going to sleep since I use a wireless mouse.  I want to recommend it but I can't.  It's not that it was bad, I have definately played worse but it just never made it to good for me, it was just meh.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In my opinion, what Audiosurf SHOULD have been.The environment still gets a little repetitive and samey, but the track shape actually MATTERS - you get to go flying during a drop, cruise smoothly during a quiet part, and ramp up to a loop during a buildup.It's not exactly a game you want to play for its smooth gameplay (though the controlling and physics are perfectly fine) - it's more or less another way to experience your music, moreso than just listening to it.Only cons for me right now are the unchanged environment (not a big problem) and a lack of support for chiptune music whatsoever. Any chiptune music you put in will be mostly flat and easy - not sure if they can fix this, but if they can it'd be great.			",287,71,7,17,31,4,26

												I’ve only played Guitar Hero once, but I really love driving games, so combining my better skill in driving than guitar buttons and coordination, this game is RIGHT in my ball park! All you have to do is stay up to speed and judge when to turn and when you REALLY need to use a speed boost, and that's IT. But the music is 100% accurate when playing, and they don’t kid you: you can play pretty much EVERYTHING including songs you WROTE if you're a musician irl and recorded any. And if you're like me and hate way too busy colors/graphics, the color choices and the amount at a time is PERFECT if you value your vision and don't want to get a massive headache. xD			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a hidden gem among all the other custom music based games. It's really fun to play these randomly generated tracks for each song you have and seeing the variations of difficulty. However the game has its own way of figuring out the difficutly and it's not based on the melody of the song so it may feel completely random to people. pros+a lot of cars and skins for each car+tracks are really fun to play+score system+you'll get your money's worth out of playing this game+drifting+very nice stats system+tracks are beautifulcons-very grindy to unlock skins/cars-tricks are limited to spirals and big jumps, no midair movement for other tricks-this is nitpicky but can't get rid of the main theme song in the menu-no splitscreenOverall, there aren't that many cons that I can think of about this game. Only thing that I didn't like was that you do not have free movement in the air to correct yourself or to even chain stunts which would have been amazing if implemented. Despite that, it's a really fun game that you'll find yourself coming back to everytime you find a new song to add to your ever growing playlist.  ",493,89,25,37,34,5,38

 Warning: This game contains flashing lights, Online DRM required for non-bundled songs and framerate cap at 60 FPS lock.Other than that it’s very hard for me to find flaws in Riff Racer, it’s a simple concept bundled with a simple game but it all works together rather well. In case it isn’t obvious this is a racing game that turns any track from your music library into a racing track and places you into a ranking board with other people that have played the same song to measure your driving skills.The way the game calculates this score is kind of ingenious, whenever you’re starting a race a set of 4 lines flash very fast, these lines are actually the multiplier for your score and the least amount of mistakes (i.e. crashing against barriers, failing jumps and not drifting properly) that you get on a track, the most likely you’re going to be 100% “in sync” with the track and get a bigger bonus for doing so at the end. The racing itself feels pretty similar to Hotwheels: Turbo Racing, with the added feature of drifting and with free style tricks on jumps being removed and replaced with tricks based on your ability to line your car properly with ramps. Each car has its own set of stats, however these stats are not defined in the car selection screen and must be learned through playing with each and every single one of them, for instance some cars have better recovery time, some better handling and some have a boost that lasts longer, however these stats are absent when picking a car in the car selection screen.The game offer replay value in the form of unlockables, each car is actually sort of expensive and each car has its own set of skins that go with it that can go up to 25,000 in-game currency with each track giving you as between 200-500 in-game currency if you’re good. The game has absolutely no micro-transactions attached to it so unlocking everything can and will take a while.The one other problem that I do find with this game however is the fact that it can be pretty trial and error at times, due to the random nature of obstacles and jumps you will find yourself doing the same song over and over again until you get it right. But overall I think it’s worth the experience, to me it’s one of the best game to have come out of early access and one of the best games of the year in general, however it does require some amount of patience as the driving can take a while to get used to.

												If you are into the genre of music games this is a fun  game that does a great and fast job at turning your music listening into a fast paced racing game.  Can race ghosts of other players including the top score, unlock new cars and customize their looks, colors.    Not as crazy as symphony gets but its a fun relaxing game when you just feel like blasting music.   The background sound effects arent over the top and almost blend in with any music you are listetning to.			",638,157,36,75,58,9,81

												There are a couple of thumbs-down reviews from people who have played it for 5 to 10 minutes and said that the tracks don't sync with the music. The first tracks I tried were Copy Of A, and Came Back Haunted by Nine Inch Nail, and the tracks matched them perfectly, with great loop-de-loops kicking in when the choruses started, pulsing red lights in time to the beat, and so forth.If your tracks don't sync, it's because you suck at the game (by falling behind beats) or your taste in music sucks.

												One of the most interesting and challenging games I have played to date. The challenge is to maintain 100% synch at all times while avoiding barriers, hit jumps correctly and collecting coins to buy more vehicles. The ability to race any track you have on you computer is awesome and ads infinite playability in my opinion. Considering the game custom makes each track based on the music you select. This feature gives this game soul, literally. I will be playing this often to relax and have fun at the same time.			",223,55,4,26,14,2,20

												I got this in Killer Bundle 8 on Bundle Stars and this was one of the games that I was most intrigued about. And this is by far one of the best games i've played out of the bundle.Sure, this idea isn't completly original (cough cough, audiosurf) but this is still a pretty good game. Each song you choose will generate a track and there hasn't been one that has repeated twice. For the same song yes but for others never. It's sort of like what No Man's Sky was going for. But unlike No Man's Sky, it does it right. Another thing I liked about this game is that the track and backdrop will highlight in different colours for the tempo and feel of the music. So if it's all jazzy and upbeat it will mix colours like purple and orange. And if it's fast and intense, it will mix colours like red and orange. It's a very clever system and I can't wait to test out more songs with it.In the end, I think Riff Racer is awesome. It's almost like Rocket League. It's been done before but this time it's done better. So yes, I think Riff Racer is defiently worth getting. And if you can, get it in the Killer Bundle because the sale right now for it is crazy.

Early Access Review
								UPDATE: Submitted my second problem to the forums and got a very prompt response!  They don't support WAV format yet, so that's likely my problem.  If you have the same one, either look into a file converter, or just wait for an update.  Otherwise, you'll just have to settle for whatever tracks you can manage to play.A very fun game, and I enjoy playing it a lot.  Games that use music as part of their mechanic interest me a lot.  However, a couple caveats.1. You'll want a controller for this game.  I had to play with the keyboard because mine didn't work, and I just can't get the precision I need with the steering.  Having a stick would give me a finer degree of control, instead of guessing how long to hold the arrow keys in a turn.  Drifting, at least, would be much easier!2. I can't speak for others, but I cannot, in fact, ""Drive Any Track"".  In fact, the majority of my music doesn't seem to be recognized by this game, despite no problems with either Audiosurf nor Beat Hazard, two other games with a similar mechanic.  This is a little frustrating as I find the only tracks I seem able to play are those I've picked up online somewhere, some possibly even pirated (I would really like to pick up the albums, but I'll keep my pirated tunes if it's the only way to play them).  I rather hope they fix this issue.  I have a lot of music I ripped from my CDs onto this computer.  I don't see why they're not available, yet random and silly songs I've collected from who-knows-where work just fine.  Unless my music is just too obscure to be supported, which shouldn't be a problem.  Not if the game wants to live up to its name.Even so, the game is still enjoyable, and perhaps some of my random tracks will inspire people to seek out more eclectic music they've yet to find.  Even stuff by some furry music artists.  I should still have plenty of songs to play.  I was just expecting to be able to play a lot more of it.			",103,40,2,12,17,0,28

Early Access Review
								Are you tired of buttonmashing in superfast songs in Audiosurf, but still want to race your own music?Well, this is a very nice alternative and its definitely worth 15 bucks.The gameplay is pretty simple: Drive with your car on a track generated by your song and try to keep up with the speed, while dodging obstacles, jumping and drifting. You can get a turbo for collecting little boxes spreaded all over the track. The faster you are, the more points you get. The End.The looks are.... decent. Definitely not Frostbite 3, but it´s on Audiosurf 2 level. It uses the ""NEON EVERYWHERE.""-Style, similar to Distance, but a bit brighter and with more colours. Also, nice by the way, all the lights on the track blink to the beat of the music.The tracks themselves don´t look awesome, they drive awesome. You have bumps, ramps, corkscrews, cliffs, giant bumps, loopings and many many corners to drive, boost, drift, dodge and jump through as the width of the track differs from corner to corner. But as I said, they don´t look awesome. Sure there´s NEON EVERYWHERE, but all you can see from the track are glowing columns hanging beside the track, neon fans and a city far, far away from the track. It looks quite empty.Overall this is already a very solid and fun game, although with ver 0.5.2 it seems to still have quite a way until full release. Looking for an Audiosurf alternative? Get this. Really, please.Features I would like to see in this game:-Workshop support for e.g. user created cars, environment styles, track hazards/gimmicks (them corkscrews and etc.)-An additional faster Gamemode, the standard is a bit slow IMO-Tachometer in BPM-Cockpit view, maybe?-Marathon mode (game/player chooses a few tracks of his library and the player has to drive them all   on one giant track)-AudioSync (tracks on the charts can be downloaded to drive)-Live Multiplayer (like the ghost feature, the cars all drive simultaneously on the track)			",136,7,33,3,5,1,5

								I bought this game on sale for well something different. It's not perfect graphics are simple, but the viduals are very stunning gives a Fzero(gamecube) vibe in some tracks,  I'm enjoying the game it's something different, it's a nice break from other games, Now value, at 16 dollars i wouldn't buy it (IMHO). I'm gonna play it some more and maybe my opinion of value will change. Overall very good job and my first time buying a steam game early access. 7.5/10ProsGreat visualsDifferentFunConsA little pricey for what you getOther than that nothing really from what i can tell.

								This is one of those game that you lose track of time in. Going through my  library of music on my hard drive to find the best driving song is a blast, and before you know it you sunk over an hour into it. That said, the algorithm in place to make tracks out of your music does have its issues. Sometimes on the harder difficulties, I find unavoidable barriers, jumps impossible to make without boost, and oddly placed boost pickups. Since this game is in Early Access, I know that these issues will probably get ironed out. That being said, The game has lots of different futuristic looking cars to drive with different visual liveries for each. The drift mechanic is fun and feels satisfying to get a big drift combo, but it would be nice to be able to chain your drift combo through turns without losing your streak.Pros:- Lots of Cars- Endless amount of levels- Pick up and play- AddictingCons:- Algorithm needs tweaking- AddictingAll in all, this game is fun and I highly recommend it!

												Wish I could vote indecisive. For the moment, it's pretty solid gameplay wise, though drifting seems to end/begin somewhat randomly. (Edit, Later I learned that holding down the button to drift doesn't effect your speed somehow, and it causes drifts to be much more reliable)My only other real riff (Ba-dum-tss) is that there is no difficulty setting, rather you depend on the seemingly questionable generator to decide on a song's difficulty rating, which even then can result in a 1 star song that's relatively difficult, or a 5 star song that doesn't seem as bad. By far the hardest song I found was Nervous_testpilot's remix of Deus Ex's Unatco. Which was only considered 4 stars for some reason. (Another edit, I have found more songs that are harder, but simultaniously I stand by my statement, songs can be vary in difficulty wildly independant of their star rating.)Overall, a pretty solid game for the reduced price I got it at, And I'm sure it'll get better over time. But just some kinks here and there that need to get worked out.			",162,16,4,12,13,1,15
