												Better than WRC 4? Yes, better than Dirt:Rally? Never. If you don't want to learn the learning curve of DiRT Rally then you will probably enjoy this one as it's really easy to get the hang of it. When it comes to performance, don't expect CM quality either, it's buggy here and there. I didn't like the sound either. It does have some cool online challenges with physical prices and a year long challenge that runs along the 2016 WRC season.I'll most likely play online for a couple of weeks, get the achievements and go back to DiRT Rally.

												+ OK graphics.+ Varied and challenging tracks. + Good semi-arcade handling.+ Clean user interface. + Nice repair system. + WRC license.- Most car engines sound like a blender. - Can barely hear the sound of tires on road. - Can barely hear the sound of DOWN gear shift. Even if you go from 6th to 2nd gear in 1 second, there's just silence.- Some corners have weird reset-on-track spots. - Lack of a proper ""TV/spectator camera"" in replays -- the broadcast view lasts no more than 3 seconds before it changes to some other random angle. - Some awful textures. - Strange and annoying frame rate inconsistency. The fps count says 60, but the whole scenery seem to move at 20fps. - Unbelievably buggy menus -- framerate limit and some controller buttons rebinding just don't register.- Sometimes the co-driver keeps completely silent... No pacenotes during an ENTIRE stage is a real game breaking issue for a rally game. - Poor wheel support (no DFGT or G25? Seriously?)- No semi-automatic shift -- a feature EVERY  other racing game offers. - No v-sync for DirectX 11. - Loading times during car selection -- Playstation 1 limitations, we meet againSorry, Kylotonn. Maybe next time.P.S.: a game at this development stage shouldn't be released on Steam without an ""Early Access"" label.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Even though WRC 5 makes improvements on WRC 4, it's still a very sketchy title. The following is my judgement whilst keeping in mind that it's supposed to be a sim-cade game, and not a DiRT Rally challenger as far as gameplay goes.The physics are a bit wonky, engine behaviour is strange, general car behaviour is largely inconsistent on a lot of stages (in the context of rally), and the pacenots get so behind at times it's impossible to drive a stage fast without knowing the stage layout by memory; it's a problem when pacenotes aren't recorded specially for a stage.The stages themselves feel a bit lifeless, and some of them are quite wide-open and boring. The video settings for a PC title are lacking, and the performance of the game itself is disappointing due to poor optimisation for the platform. The sounds have improved on what was in WRC 4, but they're still pretty bad, especially for the co-driver and some of the general car sounds. I'm sure this game will improve when people release physics mods, etc. for the game, but until then, I'd just like a good product out of the box, and for the game to run well on PC.

												For the price and current state of the game, I would strongly suggest keeping your money or buying other rally games such as Dirt Rally. If the game gets patched in the future, this has the potential to be a decent game, but it's not worth the price right now.The game is an arcade game (which is fine) but it has VERY limited wheel support and the FFB is far from perfect. Car handling and physics just feel awful, while the graphics aren't great considering I have a GTX 780 ti and  i7 4770k.The game does have some positives, with the full list of WRC rallies/cars included and car damage has been done pretty well. The stages are also decent. But unfortunately the other deficiencies of the game outweight the positives in the current build.			",71,9,47,9,23,1,17

												If and when this game gets patched (The previous dev Milestone NEVER patched any of their games, ever!) it's gonna need a lot of fixes to the handling, the sounds, the FFB on the wheels, older wheel support and many more things, it might be a decent game. Until then, DO NOT BUY THIS. Buy Dirt Rally instead if you want a better rally experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let me preface this by saying I'm not an absolute hardcore sim-racer - I don't have a wheel or a racing rig, I just play driving games using an XBOX One controller. PCARS, DiRT Rally, Race 07, etc, etc - I own and play them all. WRC 5 is rough around the edges, but with some TLC I think the game could go from good to great. It's not DiRT Rally, but it's also not awful. It's not another Milestone travesty, so we don't have to worry about garbage like the sound dropping out after two stages.I'll start with the bad:- Robotic co-driver: You do get the option of a woman co-driver, but both male and female options are spliced from sound clips rather than smooth pace notes like DiRT Rally or Dirt 2 / 3. It's not bad (and the pace notes are effective), but it's something to note.- Poor engine sounds: The cars sound like toys.- No actual routes: The courses are approximations of the real locations. It's close, but it's not the actual course.- Wheel support: There's a limited set of supported wheels.And now for the pros:+ Classes: Junior WRC, WRC 2 and WRC. You get a good selection of classes and cars, plus all the licensed drivers and gear.+ Career mode: The team stats are slightly randomized so you get a good selection of goals to choose from. + Stages: 5 unique stages and a repeat per rally, usually in a 2-2-2 format. The stages aren't terribly long, but they are fun to drive. Finland's scary at night.+ Challenge mode: The MP challenge mode is pretty fun. Time trials on a specific stage using a specific team.Reasonably, hard-core sim racers aren't going to like this. It's a balance of arcade racing and sim racing, using a real-world license. If you want a nice introduction to rally racing, this is a good place to start. It's better than WRC 4 (which isn't saying much, admittedly, but it's a marked improvement and is a decent little racing game).7/10 - needs some work, but is playable and fun.EDIT 2015-10-14: Patch 1.03 helped with the variable framerate and set DX11 as the primary launch mode, rather than DX9. I adjusted the cons to remove the framerate issues and upped my score to 7/10. The game still needs work, but it's not bad.			",368,24,66,51,54,5,54

												First of all, if you are looking for a rally sim, this game is not for you. I really wonder why Kylotonn Racing Games says that this game is a simulator, because it's not. Not even close, to be honest. And it's not a bad thing. Not for me, at least. Of course that it's a very negative aspect of the game, given the fact that the fans were waiting for an officially-licensed WRC simulator for ages. Unfortunately, they will need to wait a bit more. Even if it's not realistic, playing it is quite enjoyable: it makes you feel like a professional rally driver, nailing all the corners and flying through the straights. It's one of the most rewarding feelings while playing a rally game, of course. And you do not even need to practice a lot to be able to reach that level of ""skill"", which makes it suitable for rally lovers without too much spare time. And, even if pretty easy, nailing the stages is rewarding. Just like it would be at a simulator, but effortlessly. ""Why are all the reviews negative, then?"". That's something worth questioning. And it's clearly noticeable after 30 minutes into it: it's a massive step back from WRC 4, graphically, content-wise and physically. And it wasn't even a great rally game back in the days, because Milestone (old developer) wasn't able to leave the comfort zone and make something different. From WRC ""1"" (2010) to WRC 4 (2013), nothing changed at all, with a few exceptions (career mode was slightly improved after WRC 3, bringing classic cars and new categories). Anyway, small changes end up equalling to nothing. Mostly when pretty much everything looks the same. This is exactly why Kylotonn ended up holding the license, with a simple mission: develop the best WRC game ever made. I don't even need to mention that they failed miserably.WRC 5 is not bad. It's far away from it. The negative results are simply the reflex of disappointing the WRC fans. They were expecting a simulator, with great graphics, close to real-life stages, realistic engine sounds, convincing physics and top-notch content overall. What they got, though, was ""more of the same"": the only thing that they could consider as new were the updated cars, drivers and stages. Everything else, from gameplay to career mode, was the same. Nothing innovative, nothing exceptional. Just the usual. How could they expect their fans to react nicely?The cars are considerably beautiful (given the limitations), and so are the stages. It's really fun to drive fast through every country, nailing every single piece of it and feeling like the ultimate king of WRC. It's more than fun, honestly. It's amazing. That's where WRC 5 shines. The career mode is great, extremely immersive and rewarding but kinda empty at the same time. Maybe because it's exactly like every single career mode that the franchise had before. Innovations could and would be great. Why not to make something different like character customization, press conferences, etc...? Is it that hard to do? I don't think so. Kylotonn had to dig deeper and bring something jaw-dropping, but they decided to not take any risks and brought something that the players were used to. It's an arrow in the knee, considering that career mode is usually what most of the players are looking for (and multiplayer, of course).If you are a huge fan of the onboard cam, this game is going to disappoint you a little bit. It felt just like being shot from behind when I took the Lancer Evolution X to a ride through Mexico and noticed something quite unusual about the interior: believe it or not, it was the Impreza's. Yes, a Mitsubishi with a Subaru interior. This evidences how much research were done in order to bring the best WRC experience that you could ever ask for.There are lots of positive aspects, though. The cars have different liveries for each and every rally, with the respective logo (ADAC, RACC, Neste Oil Finland, etc). It's a small detail that makes a lot of difference. DiRT Rally, on the other hand, has the same sticker for each and every stage. Would be even better if it was actually an innovation, but the old Milestone titles had it as well. Same for the custom name on the window (which is incredibly immersive and extremely cool, and I am glad that Kylotonn ""copied"" this). Two little details that end up counting a lot.Regarding wheel support, this game is a joke. The actual list of supported wheels has less than 7 different models if I am not wrong. It's unacceptable for a 2015 game, and the devs promised a fix one year ago. Nothing yet. Continuous support is really important if you actually want your game to be popular and loved by the players.If you are just a casual looking for fun, dust and high speeds, this game is definitely worth a try. Do not pay full-price for it, though. Kylotonn is asking way too much for what the game actually offers. Wait for a sale and then buy it, download it and play it. If you are a rally lover like me, you are going to enjoy this game a lot (as long as you do not expect it to be a simulator, and also ignore the negative aspects).			",555,142,53,60,81,7,77

												First impressions:Graphics:  With a 4670k O/C'd to 4.3 ghz and a GTX 970 I'm getting very low frame rates (less than 60), even with all graphic settings set to LOW or OFF.  This is just at 1080p.  Very few options to change as well.Sound:  Watch some vids, it's pretty awful.  Co-driver sounds like a robot, car sounds are very poor.HUD and Camera Views: Standard camera views, but when you switch to cockpit view, you have NO tachometer, no speedometer, and no idea what gear you are in.  This could just be a bug for the car that I was using.  If you shift views in the middle of the race it will reset your current gear to 1.  Why on earth would this happen?  The tach is nearly impossible to see what RPM you are actually at, as the colors of the green/red only get slightly darker as you progress.  You really only know when to shift if you hit the redline.Wheel Support and Force Feedback:  Just atrocious....  No clutch pedal support whatsoever (don't think H shifter either, but haven't tried yet).  There are some adjustments for sensitivity and deadzones, but only a bar to move with no numerical values.  FFB is quite awful, but it is there.  There are 2 sliders in which you can change the strength and vibraton (?).  If you completely lower the sliders to 0 then the wheel suddenly becomes a vibrating mess.  In short, this game is probably best played with a controller...Physics:  About what you would expect.   More arcade like but you do need to use the brakes in this game at least....Rally school:  A complete joke.  Not even worth discussing.  You have to do the same courses for Basics, 2wd, and 4wd.  Honestly just a huge waste of time.Overall:  With only an hour of playtime so far, I'm giving this game a 2/10.  This may change with further playtime, but currently its a buggy, laggy mess.  Stay far away from it.			",94,5,12,8,7,0,11

												I like it.The stage design is good, the handling is decent, the graphics are average and the audio is mediocre.The handling is quite forgiving and easy to get the hang of, but there's room to better yourself through practice.There are 65 different stages ranging from 2 to 12 km spread across 13 locations.The stage design itself is quite good, but the road surfaces themselves could use more bumps and camber changes.The visuals aren't too impressive, but there are a lot of nice visual details around and being able to choose time of day and weather for any track is great. The car models and damage look pretty good too.The audio isn't too impressive either and while the co-driver is functional, they sound pretty robotic.They have handled the service-park repairs well, with partial repairs being an option and some components being completely replaced.Overall I thoroughly enjoy the game and would recommend it if you're a fan of the WRC and Rally games.I think WRC 5 is a commendable effort by Kylotonn and I look forward to the sequel should they make one, this game is a solid foundation for the next.

												To the Devs...You really need to get more wheel support, G25 and Fanatec CSR Standard ESPECIALLY.  Losing alot of sales due to this.  Wheel support and triple monitor support needs to be looked into.  More wheels as a priority.Let's get some patches, let's boost the sales, and lets get a decent game here! :)Changing my mind after playing a few hours on a controller.  Easy to pick up and play game.  Various setup options for the hotheads like me!  Would recommend as a fun game, but be wary about the lack of wheel support at this current time.  Hopefully we will get hard working devs that continue to push the game to its best? :)			",66,1,18,2,3,2,5

												I have no idea how playable the game is with a keyboard or a steering wheel, but I can say that it is totally playable with a xbox 360 gamepad.I just finished the Monte Carlo rally (I won by one second!), and after changing some settings I was good to go: I totally recommand to play in ""hood camera"" mode, for me that's the most comfortable position: It gives you decent visibility of the road while giving you a good feeling of where the car is regarding to the road which makes it easier to use the hand-brake to corner the right curves.The game is definitely of the arcad-ish familly (think VRally, Sega Rally), and the tracks have a nice blanding of tarmac, snow, night driving, gravel, ...Technically, it ran smooth-as-butter in 2560x1440 on my config (Core i7, Geforce 970, Windows 7), and in three-hours of playing I did not have any issue.

												I really wish they didn't advertise the game as a simulator, because it definitely is not. What it is, however, is a casual game meant for rally and WRC fans. If you're looking for realism, you won't find it here. The tracks are mostly fictional and the car physics are simcade level at best. The visuals are serviceable but dated and are reminiscent of racing games on last gen consoles. The performance could be better, but the game should run fine on a modern low end system with some tinkering in the graphics options. With VSync off, I average around 70 fps on max settings with an r7 370 at 900p (45 fps at 1080p). Turning the shadows down a notch yielded a 10-15 fps boost.There is plenty of content to play through in the solo campaign. You start out as a junior and have to work your way up every season to become a champion.  The rally school is a really nice addition for people who aren't familiar with rally techniques. There are random leaderboard challenges that appear from time to time that serve as a bit of side content. If you just want to drive and not worry about the career, there is a quick stage mode that has every track and car unlocked. Overall, I would say the single player portion is very plain. You don't really need to do anything but drive. The car repairs, car setup, and team management have mostly been automated. While there are plenty of tracks, they are an example of quantity over quality. Most are short (<5 minutes) and have rather bland environments. Also, don't get this for multiplayer unless you have friends to play it with since it's mostly dead.tl;drIf you just want to sit back with a controller (or whatever your preference) and have some casual rallying fun, then you should get this on a sale.

												I thought this would be a case of 'give it some time and it will grow on you' but alas it doesn't seem possible. The description of this game describes it as ""THE racing simulation standard"". Well, if that is the case, I'm not so sure how someone came to that opinion. Here is what I PERSONALLY like and don't like. Pros - WRC Licensing. I love seeing the pros and their cars. Though, I'm not certain the sound effects are spot on. Also, It would be great if there was a better viewpoint inside the car. Cons - Nothing online worked for me. I'd get errors connecting to the server. Another mode told me there were over 100 days till I could play it online. Well, alright, fair enough. I guess you need a following to promote an e-sport. Sadly I'm not sure there will be one. Controller Support - This game is limited in what you can  and can't use. Some of the most popular logitech wheels aren't supported, and you can't use multiple inputs in your setup. It doesn't support clutch pedals, so no manual override. My current rallying setup includes a shifter, a wheel, a pro 3 pedal setup, and a separate handbrake. It would not read the input from my handbrake at all - only my wheel as a game controller. Audio - You'll end up wanting to turn off the co-driver voice - which is about the worst thing I can think to do in a rallying game. It's like a robot that doesn't understand word structure or inflection, just belting out words over and over. It's hard to follow and doesn't sound realistic at all.  This game is planted firmly in contemporary rally, which is great if you are into it. however, after playing the game with multiple cars and setups I wasn't able to find anything interesting in trying different cars. There were differences, but not anything noteworthy enough to make the game seem fun. So that's the big thing for me. If it's not a sim, it should at least be fun. I'd have kept it if it were good at at least one of those things.			",125,23,15,9,16,1,7

Posted: October 9, 2015
Introduction:I've been playing Rally games since I got a DOS version of Lombard RAC Rally in the late 80's and Championship Rally for the Nintendo back in the early 90's (my sons), and later  Rally Championship 2000,  RalliSport Challenge, all of the Colin McRae rally games through to Dirt 2  as well as the  later Dirt games, and  although not classed as rally games the early  road  racing Need for Speed games, Richard Burns Rally , Sega Rally,  Xpand Rally   plus a few others I've forgotten the names of.   I've   loved most of  them for various reasons and  WRC 5 is no exception.The latest iteration of World Rally Championship  v5 is IMO perhaps the best  in the WRC  franchise so far, with decent physics when driving on the various surfaces   such as gravel, snow dirt sand etc.  the sounds, including external  environmental sounds,  hitting various obstacles, the various  'tame' expletives your co driver  shouts  when you  crash or   have a near miss, are not the best, but all go to making  a decent  rally game experience.   For newcomers to rally games there's  a  useful  Rally School  mode and an easy driving styles  mode when playing  solo.    Modes of Play:Solo Mode:There are two main  modes of play, Solo and Multiplayer. Solo is divided into four more modes, 'Quick Stage', where you play just one stage of a rally, or   'Quick Rally' where you can choose to play any one of the rally  meets, including all of the stages. The third  solo mode  is   Career mode, where you play all of the championships  rally meets in a particular order; you can't  select   any rally, you have to play them in order according to the real World Championships, starting with the Monte Carlo Rally, then, you move to the next, i.e. Vodaphone Rally de Portugal etc etc.  Some stages in each rally are repeated but  with different road or environmental  conditions, such as day  and night, clear or icy etc.If you wish to start a new career,  you can do so, but it will wipe all progress  from the career you've already started.The final solo mode is the  Rally School, a useful tool if you are a novice, or not very confident rallying.    This is divided into five different   sections that initially cover the basics  such as pace notes, detailed angles, different kinds of turns and surfaces, accelerating and stopping on tarmac (the easiest surface to negociate), using the hand brakes etc.  Then there's coping with 2 wheel drive  4 wheel drive (two separate sections for this) and advanced techniques.  at the end of each section you have to put all you've learnt in that section together.  You are not able to skip any part of the  Rally School tutorials and you need to pass a certain standard in each  part to progress to the next.Multiplayer Mode and Leaderboards:The multiplayer options include online and offline multiplayer, quick match, online invitation and creating a private or public game.  These modes basically speak for themselves so there's  no need to go into detail.  The offline multiplayer  is  almost like playing single player, in that you race  singly between up to 8 players, each one  playing in turn, whereas with  the online multiplayer option, all players  race together, but  do not interact with each other (i.e, you can see them as Ghosts.  As I'm not primarily a multiplayer enthusiast, I can't expand on this area at this time.  I only like playing  vehicle based games online  with good friends as I'm embarrasingly  dire when it comes to technique and racing in general;  for example, looking at the world rankings for this game  20 hours into  the game being released  I stood at 377th out of 450  players, with a 45 second gap between my times and the leader and that was  just for one complete rally and championship type.  There are   three or four of these included in the game  (JWRC, WRC etc).  I felt like I was going as fast as the road conditions and my vehicle allowed,  yet being beaten by 45 seconds makes me wonder what I'm doing wrong.  Hopefully as I work through the rally school I'll improve somewhat. (fingers crossed). For those who are competitive, there are leader boards that show  overall  rankings for all players,  as well as  friends leader boards.Control Options:There are three configurable modes of control; Keyboard, Steering Wheel and Controller.  For any rally game enthusiast, the   Steering Wheel is the  best choice as you have more  'configurable' control over the keyboard,   and is the  most immersive control option;  for example you can  configure acceleration, brake and steering sensitivity with dead zones, whereas the  keyboard has no dead zones. The  Steering Wheel option also includes force feedback, (as does the Controller option) which gives a much greater feel and immersivness to the game, plus  your vehicle is much easier to control  compared to if you used a keyboard.  Unfortunately I've  still not unpacked my Logitech steering wheel, pedals and shifter since we moved house  (must do that soon). I've read that others have been having problems  with their  wheels not being supported.  Hopefully  this will be  addressed  in an update soon.  I found using the X-Box controller was  easier than the keyboard and included basic force feedback. There appears to be six degrees of freedom with this game, at least in some of the camera modes, for example, you can look from side to side, upwards and behind in  chase mode and in  cockpit mode  left and right and upwards.  Unfortunately the track IR hasn't been configured for any of the WTC games, so it's unlikely that we will be seeing  WRC5  Track IR enhanced, Maybe   Naturalpoint (the developers of the track IR system) may be considering  the latest title. The first 3 Dirt titles and some of the earlier Colin McRae as well as most of the other titles I mention at the beginning of this review   all have Track IR enhancements.  If this game gets it, it will add even more immersivness.The game also works with the Novint Falcon a force feedback device that gives excellent force feedback, but as the   device was primarily designed for mouse based games and  games with guns, it's not  as easy to control your driving unless you use it in conjuction with the keyboard.Driving Styles:There are four driving styles to choose from  starting with easy, through to medium, hard and  expert.  I've only played it on easy so far so can't  expand on the differences yet.  I will be updating this  review as and when I continue to play the game as I'm only on the second rally  at the moment.Repairing your vehicle:You can configure/tune you car  (in the motor home) for various conditions  to ensure optimal driving.  Skill alone  won't  see you winning every race because if you  haven't set up your car for the right conditions for the stage you are about to enter, you'll find your  vehicle will  damage more readily.  You can only  repair your vehicle between  the main stages in any  rally and   depending on how much damage you have   you are likely  not going to be able to repair everything  because you are only allowed   an amount of time that represents the  time allowed  in the real WRC  championship;  i.e. 45 minutes,  so you need to prioritise  which areas you  repair, for example geras, engine, body work,  brakes, electronics, steering etc.  for those less experienced with   the  more recent rally games (the  last WRC   game and I think the  later dirt games have a similar  repair  process) you can  set repairs to automatic. If you select this the A.I. will repair what it considers the  most urgent  repairs. However, don't  ignore the manual process entirely because   damage can also be dependant on the players  style. In my last race my electronics ended up being  zero percent viable, so was going to spend some time repairing them, but  I decided to go for the automatic o			",4945,1930,224,565,875,79,758

												- handling is an insult for gamers with wheel (Logitech G27 started to work like yesterday after numbers of patches)- handling is an insult for gamers with pads- it's an insult even for gamers with keyboards (no ofence guys pls)- ingame framerate drops, 1 s freezes, flickering shadows, bad lighning eg brake lights- as always a game with nVidia pXysX not working good on Nvidia hardware not to mention it's nightmare for AMD users. Look at the Spintires - Havok runs great even on a computers made from cheese or potato. So next is- Insanely high hardware recomemmendation to real smooth play*- No physics at all, you found more in a Toybox Turbo- Weird sound- Ruined WRC License+ WRC license+ in menu 60 fpsUpdate: At least patch 107 and changing GFX setting repaired slow fps in menu and slightly overall performance of the game.'Change to Full screen without borders'

												Only tried it for 2.5 hours..The outside cockpit wiev is abysmal and almost non playable but when you turn to cockpit/car camera the games feels alot better dont know if that is because of the physics or if the camera angle is just lacking.The career mode has been fun so far starting in JWRC and getting contracts it seems from season to season so no drive and get 5 first placecs to proceed.The physics feels 55/45 arcade/sim but quite fun.You can not play a championship in hotseat just single stages.  Mediocre.The AI pacewise feels somewhat good but its too early to tell.The career mode seems to change parameters each season too so no season will be exactly the same. Id say thats a very good idea that no contract based racer that races season to season have done.For a first game from a new studio it feels pretty good and is a good start will update this review as i play more..I have a r9 280 and fx 8320 and i can run it at medium/high so not a disaster but not that good either.7/10 so far ",199,95,9,41,10,5,7

												Finally, I realized that WRC series carry on their way on arcade game, rather than the sim style.Adv:Complete stages granted by WRC.Disadv:The graphis is not good, it seems like no advance from WRC 4, Blending, shadowing or something like is not the key point, the Detail of stage is!Physics: Wow. Even it is a arcade game, it should not be the ""need for speed style"". It is still a rally game. I think you guys should adjust a lot. I do not feel driving, but skiting.... I would not compare this game with Dirt Rally. Not the same catagory at all. BTW,UI: it is an issue. I know your product aims to all platforms. But do not forget not every pc gamer has joystict or game controller. What should I do when I was required to push ""Y"" button to see my replay? I dont have Y button and not reflect in controll setup!Audio: The sound of engine when I shift gear is so weird and no even a tiny break between different gears. Looking forward to your next upgrade or patches			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I definitely wouldn't call this a hardcore sim. But the physics are consistent, solid and fun.The FFB ROCKS in comparison to the previous WRC title.BEWARE if you're using a wheel setup constisting of multiple usb inputs (wheel, pedals, shifter, handbrake, etc) because they kinda forgot to account for those setups and they flat out don't work atm. I'm using a G27 and everything is working great. (EDIT: since this review, they've fixed most of the wheel compatibility issues)Feels a lot like DiRT 2, without all the non-rally crap. Goooood casual rallying. Not arcade or sim. There's some definite weirdness going on with AI, online structure and video settings. It's not perfect, and we'll see how the dev responds to the various problems. Let's hope it's better than the previous dev. Don't buy it for multiplayer. Get in on sale.			",67,31,30,0,4,0,0

												WRC 1 is up to now still the best installment in the series. Not much because of it's richer content, because it isn't much, but because it really wasn't too different from WRC 6. The main problem with the WRC franchise still persists. These problems include:- Invisible hitboxesI dare you to play through Rally Mexico without hitting walls that are 3m away from the car. Possibly the most annoying thing about the game.- Badly marked ""penalty"" zonesPenalties are very strict, and they are in 50% of the cases highly illogical, are in a natural grip path in the curves, and sometimes you don't go 1 meter outside of track and bam, you are in penalty. Worst rallies with this problem: Mexico and GermanyGraphics ain't gonna do it for me in WRC 7. If they don't address these problems, i'm out.			",36,1,1,2,2,0,1

												Pretty fun game. Gfx are great of course. Sound is okay. G25 Wheel Force Feedback is average.  My biggest complaint is that there seems to be too much traction even on full simulation mode.  I played a snow run in WRC5 and then switched to Richard Burns Rally and I felt much more comfortable with RBR.  When you floor it out of a turn in the snow there is not a lot of traction, but WRC5 gvies a little bit too much and you are soon fish tailing down the road as it tries to pull you into the ditch.The interface is really cool and looks good.  Easy to navigate through the menus.There are a lot of stages to run. I'm really liking it for the most part and I have played many many rally games in my life. Now at my advanced age, I can still say I play them a lot! Overall a great game, I Just think if you switch to ""full sim"" mode that you should lose a lot of traction and have to slide more into turns...Oct 22, 2015.I keep crashing on the menu screens. Frustrating.Still I am really liking the game!G25 wheel is working really good and the feedback is nice! I like the tight turns, which is one reason I like this game.The damage to the car is very interesting and the tires keep getting worn down, making it harder to control.  But everything gets beat up and having no brakes is frequent and common.  Many times the car is stuck in 3rd Gear after slamming into something. More soon...Oct 24.Just a quick note that the dust coming off of the tires looks pretty strange. The dust seems to rise to fast...Looks really odd.12/23. Got a lot further now that they updated and I am really liking this game! I think one big thing that is ""not right"" are the particles. I.e. dust and dirt and especially water. It looks really strange. That could be next releases fix: to improve the dust for replays mostly, but people do notice these things.Quick note about sound: I like it. I am watching Ogier/Ingrassia 2015 (Guanajuato, Mexico) onboard video right now , and guess what? The engine sounds are VERY similar to WRC5.  So they did a great job on that!12/31/2015: I fixed the steering issue I was having. Which was I had it at very low sensitivity, which makes it hard to correct during hairpins. I fixed that ,now this game is really getting fun!			",13,0,7,0,2,0,1

												WRC 5. Yes! This is really a  rally game! After 5 month of torture myself inside codemasters' Fake Rally I entered here - and I feel like some new dimensions sweeped open! I feel inertia and drift, I guide with them in different ways, sometimes I catch flying feelings. I have space for creativity! The game is definitely better, than WRC 1-4 (no words any ""dirt"")/ Of course railway drivers, which exposed to  outrage their physical intuition for many years playing railway dirt arcade, cannot feel it, but true rally lovers - its for you! And our community will grow up with such game, although picture sometimes disappointing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												+ Nice graphics with some great effects on snow, light shafts through trees etc.+ The cars sound great and so does your co-driver.+ Alot of courses from WRC, including, Mexico, Sweeden, Germany, Australia, France, UK etc.+ Feeling of speed is good when driving fast.- Wheel support is average- FFB needs some work- Feeling of the car when driving slow.- I never figured out how to drive through a hairpin.- Textures some times look low-resolution.All in all WRC5 is a nice rally game with alot of tracks if you like rally-games.  Unfortunately it lacks polish and a better FFB/wheel support.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												WRC5 is a cross between an arcade and Rally sim. The graphics are very nice. Road surfaces you can feel the diference between gravel, tarmac and snow. The road surfaces look real enough and the scenery is very nice also. Roads are also not very wide which is how they should be. On the night stages the car lights are the best Ive seen on any rally game.  Overall an excellent Rally game. Its nice to see a new arcade/sim on the market. I recommend it.			",297,36,49,12,29,3,26

												TL;DR consider getting this game if you want an arcady and more easy rally game.Full story:Many reviews seem to be comparing this game to Dirt Rally (I own both of these games), and the way this game is marketed suggests it is a rally simulator. However, people, who search for rally simulator will not find it here, because this game has quite arcady driving and damage models. That certainly will not appeal to Dirt Rally crowd, but I think people who are not into hardcore racing simulators would enjoy this game: this game has rally school, much less steep learning curve and it can be enjoyed without having a racing wheel. The tradeoff is not that realistic driving.Is it better than WRC 4? Yes. It runs smoothly at 60 FPS (older game was locked to 30), the graphics seem to be a big improvement over WRC 4. The amount of cars is decent, but less than Dirt Rally offers and classes are limited to WRC, WRC-2 and J-WRC. The price compared to amount of content on offer (comparing to Dirt Rally) is quite high, but if you can get it on sale, it is worth the money.Cons: it suffers from problem WRC 4 had as well: many special stages are on same pieces of road, so amount of unique roads is much smaller than number of stages. The rewind feature seems to be missing from WRC 4, now you just can restart from last checkpoint. Some signs of poor port from consoles to PC: key prompts seems to be bugged out, a lot of times Xbox controller prompts are shonwn for me when I only own a Logitech Driving Force GT, which has PS3 buttons on it.As a conclusion I can say if you are into hardcore racing simulators, you own a decent raging wheel, then get Dirt Rally, it is much better game for you. If you are into more arcady and more casual fun, this might be worth it for you.			",611,194,64,74,137,13,124

												7.5/10 - Worth a visit, at the right price, for any rally fan.First Impressions+ 9 patches on pc, Kylotonn appears to be very committed and is listening to the community.+ nice simple to navigate menus (though some may not be happy with no mouse control).+ (since latest patches) able to detect all 3 components of my wheel setup.  including my Fanatec CSR Elite pedals and Thrustmater TH8A as separate USB conenctions.- wish it would detect the Thrustmater TH8A in analog mode for handbrake (instead of needing to use sequential mode).- overall sound needs improvement, engine sounds especially.  co-driver could also use work, has awkward pauses and sounds robotic.Graphics and Visual Impression+ runs just fine on triple screens (but no advanced rendering options).  appears to be well optimized (almost always 60 fps on triples with a single gtx 970).- overall the visuals can't match visuals of DiRT Rally or other AAA racing games.- no FOV or ability for full camera adjustments (but cockpit does give 5 view distance options).- tracks could use more activity from crowd or wildlife.  feels lifeless.Handling and Physics+ decent damage modeling that effects handling (but have yet to see a full retirment).  few smart ideas with damage; stuck in a gear, loss of co-driver audio (electronics issues), etc.  fairly realistic repair format at service stops (can't fix tyres by 3%).= sim-cade physics.  heavy cars and plenty of lateral grip when coasting makes it very easy to drive, but trail braking in to corners, and too heavy of accelreation in or out of corners can still be punished.  reminds me a lot of Colin McRae 2005 and similar... it's a very enjoyable drive, while not totally realistic.= average at best force feedback.  advanced wheel options are lacking, but I've been able to get it to feel good at 900 degrees of rotation.Track Selection+ no deja vu, all 65 stages are unique.  353.7 KM of stages, 5 for each of the 13 coutries (one is repeated in a rally).  This is double that found in DiRT Rally, and still more a bit more than the 300 km quoted by Seb Loeb Rally Evo.+ enjoyable stage designs, that feel authentic to the region.  reasonable track widths (not extremely wide and unrealistic).  good variation in terrain and turn types and corner combinations.- stages are not real world recreations, as featured in DiRT Rally and Seb Loeb Rally Evo.- some stages are very (2-3 km) short.  overall average is 5.4 km per stage (longest is 11 km).Overall ExperienceI'm really enjoying my time with WRC 5.  Those who only care about simulations can skip this title.  But if you're someone who is willing to play something a little more casual, you should be able to easily enjoy this experience.  Thing that makes rally awesome is learning new roads/routes... and this game will let you do that at a great volume.  Career mode is interesting enough as you make your climb from Junior, WRC 2, and finally to WRC.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After playing WRC4 I can tell that...the gameplay it feels different for sure, I believe that it feels slowly than in WRC4. I try to configure my video settings and I have a high performance video card (Nvidia) with 4 Gb dedicated and well dont like at all this. In the scale from 0-10 I give a 7 I was expecting a better gameplay and graphics but in my opinion it does not have it .....but for the price is ok. I probably buy other game related to RALLY as is Dirty Rally.But please dont take it in a bad way is just I like it but not in the way that it supposed to be.OK Enjoy it.Well here is my update .....I finished the career mode at junior WRC and after that, the game itself turns pretty cool for me.....so, I like it for sure. I think that the best improvements could be the animation and steering control, or what do you think?			",57,8,7,3,11,0,3

												If you want to play something that tries too hard at giving a real life rally experience, play Dirt Rally. If you want to play a video game, play this game. I personally like to have fun, I see video games as a way to relieve stress after a hard day at work. After I bought Dirt rally, I had to get a refund an hour later because I was not looking for a Dark Souls of Rally. I used that same money to buy WRC 5 and I don't regret it one bit. I believe that games are a way to escape real world not bring us one step closer to the matrix. The handling is alright in my opinion and from what I experienced in the career mode so far is good. The car damage decent. The graphics isn't impressive, but what I learned from playing the first homefront is that you don't need eyecandy to have fun. 8/10			",131,6,12,5,3,1,6

												The game is quite good, I play it with a Fanatec CSW v2. Took me a while to find the best in game setting for the wheel for after that the experience is very good. The only negative point is the position of the hood camera, the noticeable delay in the wheel movement in in dash view and the dashboard cam itself. I play with the hood view and it is cool. Please work on the dash camera for next version.Graphics are very good and sound too.			",175,12,46,4,9,0,5

												Update since the release of WRC 6.With the recent release of the DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED WRC 6, there is little if any reason to pick up this version especially at the full price tag. In short it is pretty unpleasant compared to WRC 6 and even WRC 4 was better than this!Given that I was one of the few who stuck by WRC4 despite its faults I was really looking forward to this game as WRC4 was a step in the right direction for rallying enthusiasts after the recent DIRT abominations. However, as much as I want to like this game and probably will still play it solely because it represents the WRC championship, it is simply an OK offering that let's you play through the WRC calendar. Graphics are glitchy and worst of all there are so many things about it that are inconsistent like the damage model for instance. Could have been so much more. Play it for the WRC calendar that it represents but don't expect to be blown away by it. Definite improvement over WRC 4 but still not the full meal deal although certainly entertaining and challenging enough at times. The recent Dirt Rally is apparently leaps and bounds ahead of anything this can hope to be as well as Sebastien Loeb Evo which is also pretty impressive, and I look forward to playing either of those once the extremely high price tags especially for Sebastien Loeb Evo come down, even more so once they start getting more content. If the current WRC calendar is what you really want then play this if it comes on sale, otherwise save your pennies for DIRT Rally or Sebastien Loeb Evo! In short fun but not amazing and more one to pick up in a sale.			",178,10,17,31,25,1,96

												Great game to introduce to new gamers that want to get into rally racing. The physics of the different terrains feel nice and the game is also easy to play. It's more of an Arcady Rally Racer than being a simulator but it does simulate aswell. the loading of the game is fast and snappy.  the rally school is a huge help although i find it only helps for left or right 1's. another issue would be that i would like to know what the driver is saying, especially when he/she says ""for right 3 into hairpin left"". 1 thing devs i really like the cockpit camera from WRC 4, please bring that back. but besides little issues its a good game.

												If you want a simulation and play with a wheel, than Dirt Rally is game for you and WRC 5 will disappoint you. But if you want a funny and easy-to-learn simcade (mixture between pure arcade like in Need for Speed and simulation like in Dirt Rally or Richard Burns Rally) title, you will have fun with it :)Graphics and sound are only mediocre, but drifting around is a lot of fun, even with a keyboard. Unlike Dirt Rally, this game forgives errors and one small mistake doesn't mean you have to restart the stage. The variety of tracks and cars is great, unfortunately there are no classic rally cars (e.g. group B). The weather effects can create an amazing athmosphere, driving through sweden at night while it snows is something very different compared to the same stage at daylight with sunshine.Some players have reported performance problems. For me, they are gone since update 1.09 and the new ""Option A"" for Vsync.			",35,2,2,3,1,0,1

												This game is alot of fun. Short learning curve and becomes easier to control the car the more you drive. I have a G27 Logitech wheel and it works fine with it. You definately have to spend some time setting your wheel, visual preferences, and audio preferences. Take time to play it with an open mind. Remember its a racing game. The only gripes I have is the game career mode weather is almost always bad. Visually its hard to see through all the fog and rain. Night races are the same. Set your visual setting to farthest in visual settings. Sounds will go on and off at times. This game does have bugs but I think if people let BigBen know in the forums that they will fix them. Game is great fun and could better.			",312,52,36,24,13,1,11

												I'm having a genuine pleasure playing WRC5 ! Learning curve is really good. Coming from some Dirt titles, I was surprised to discover this WRC game offers quite a challenge and gives me the need to improve myself constantly.Damage and repair systems are probably the features I prefer because they add a very nice feel of realism to the game.Graphics are good.I like the career mode and the roads I've met so far. Stages can be long enough to let you immerse and focus on your driving skills ;)I would recommend this game as well for rally fans as for new players to discover driving simulation games.I didn't test MP mode yet.

												Do not buy this game.Pretend Race Cars lays out why you shouldn't really well over on their site, but let me summarize:This is a racing game developed by folks that formerly made fitness and yoga games. And while that's not necessarily a problem, this FEELS like a racing game designed by such. The physics aren't great, the graphics would be outstanding if this were 1.5 decades ago, the special stages are short, and the interface is quite awful. The cars are uninteresting and there is no attention paid whatsoever to any kind of history of the WRC (Group B anyone?). It's a slog and only my OCD is keeping me going through it to get 100% of the achievements (even that is a pain). Finding people online to play is a pain, and the only reason you might have any luck with that is because the WRC (I think?) is running a tourney for folks to win a Hyundai i20 IRL. I don't think even a 20,000 Euro car is worth sufficient skill in this game.Avoid.What do you buy instead? Honestly you'd be lucky to buy RalliSport Challenge 2 on the original Xbox instead, but if you want true rally experience from this actual generation, get Dirt Rally, and if you want an arcade racer, get Driveclub on the PS4. Yes it's worth getting a PS4 for.tl;dr I hate myself for putting as much time into this as I have; it sucks.			",160,50,11,10,12,1,21

												I'm renovating my house and for the time being I cannot use my FF steering wheel, however WRC5 is a pretty fun rally experience with a controller.Note, I usually hate playing driving games with a controller, but WRC5 seems to do fine. Only using auto shift, which I prefer with a controller, all other aids off. Ok, it lacks the finesse of a proper wheel setup, but once you get over that you can still have a lot of rally fun.WRC5 offers a WRC rally experience that is true to the franchise. More simcade than sim, it certainly works for a quick fix.I'll update this review once I have my steering wheel setup installed again, but for the time being I'm having fun with WRC5.

												Love it. Yes, Dirt has better graphics, but the physics aren't real at all. Dirt is programmed for everyone to drive like Kenny Block, guess what, there's only one Kenny Block and it's not any of you because he does it in real life, which is why you find WRC 5 different. Many complain ""oh the sound is awful"". Have you children even watched a WRC race in the last 5 years? You'll b.s. that you have, but you have not, you've only played DIRT. The sound is realistic. I've realized that DIRT lovers are the Call of Duty rejects but for Racing sims. They love easy gaming that fills their little ego's. Dirt = makes the kids happyWRC = makes the rally lover happy.

												One of the best rally games! Although wouldn't say fans of simulation-Yes it is still more for fans of arcade racing games! But nevertheless, the game deserves the highest assessment among rally games of this class.All at the highest level in this game has it all-beautiful scenery terrain,very well made tracks,weather effects,and finally the damage to the car is all there.Separately of course want to praise the main thing is the driving on the track is done very professionally and realistically.A variety of settings in the game are impressive-it looks modern and I put them on high and I am very impressed and satisfied!Одна из лучших раллийных игр! Несмотря на то что бы не говорили любители симуляторов-да она всё-таки больше для аркадных любителей гоночных игр! Но тем не менее игра заслуживает наивысшей оценки среди раллийных игр подобного класса.Всё на высшем уровне-в этой игре есть всё-прекрасные пейзажи местности,очень качественно сделанные трассы,погодные эффекты,наконец повреждения автомобиля всё это в ней есть.Отдельно конечно хочеться похвалить главное-это управление автомобиля на трассе-это сделано очень профессионально и реалистично.Разнообразные настройки в игре впечатляют-это выглядит современно и я выставил их на максимум и очень впечатлён и доволен!

												Nice to see a new WRC game!The game looks fantastic and I really like the handling of the cars once you disable all driving helps. You can really feel the grip difference accross all the different surfaces.What a pleasure to play with all the official cars from the WRC championship. The job done by this new studio is very good and the rallies they created are very realistic. It's a good point to see that all the stages are different and you do not have a reverse stage or something annoying like that.I started the carreer mode wich is full of options like the spirit of your team and mechanics depending on the results.The damage system is well done, if you crash your car too many times, you can brake your gearbox or even your radio transmission with your codriver, and it can be a good challenge to finish a stage without any pacenotes!I play it with my G27 from Logitech and compatibility is OK for me! I can't wait to hear more about the eSports competition announced by the devs!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Update: I have stayed away from this game for some time and went back for another go. There have been small improvements in some areas, but, the fact that they are trying to pass this off as anything other than an arcade handling model is laughable. The game can be so much more. The FFB is stronger, but, makes no effort to give you any ""feeling"" of what your auto is doing. In Mexico,; there are a lot of turns and such with visable deep rutts, which I purposefully drove through and had no feedback at all and then when the road was smooth I received weird strong vibrations as if I was driving on a rumble strip. The fact that this game is connected to the Official WRC license is a waste in my opinion. It could have and definately SHOULD have been done far better. EDIT: I have had to change my previous endorsment of this abortion. They have managed to com[letely make the game unplayable for many players, stuttering and frame rate issues that make the game unplayable and we get ""future patches to fix stuttering and frame rate issues"". So STAY FAR AWAY until they fix it or Loeb comes out. This game has a few issues, THE BIGGEST being the pace notes, and it is far from the quality of DIRT Rally. But it is fun. The game has decent graphics if run in DX11 Mode and it has okay FFB. The stages are cool as they are ""real"" WRC stages and some are pretty long. They do cut and paste a lot just like DIRT but they have all the ""Official"" WRC Countries. There really is not much feedback from road surfaces, but , if you go off track into the grass or what not - it does give you some feedback for that. It does not have much in the way of surface changes like dirt simulates well, and the little differences in surface will not be sent through the wheel. it doesnt really alter much from the road surfaces even though there are visual clues of uneven road and rutts and the like. It just doesnt feel any different physically.The physics are not by any means ""SIM"" but they do have a difference in 2 wheel and 4 wheel drive and the weather makes a difference also. It is not gonna be ""Game of The Year"" but if you can pick it up on sale it is worth the price of admission.  I paid $35 US and think I may have paid a little too much, but, it really is not that bad of a game. Takes some getting used to. The cars seem to behave strange til you dial in the FFB settings and the controller settings. I would recommend this to anyone who is a Rally fan who doesnt expect too much from it. I have DIRT Rally and thats the game i would get if i could only have one of the two, but, if you can get both - it is great fun after you adjust to it. And I am sure they will patch some of the small bugs and optimize it a little more, at least I hope they will.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't be fooled by the early reviews or negativity.  The developer has obviously patched this title.  If you're a hard-core rally fan, then you won't be disappointed.  I was surprised at how well this played.  Arcade my♥♥♥♥♥♥ this is great and I had no problem setting up my ancient momo wheels and pedals. I also use this in conjunction with my xbox 360 wireless controller.  The latter only to navigate the gui and the wheel/pedals to race.  The physics/damage model is superb and the stages feel great.  The variety of locations and cars is nice.  Graphics wondeful.  I can race my 2016 sti and thats awesome.  I think people just need something to complain about or are technically challenged because I haven't had a single problem and believe this title is a must-have for lovers of this genre.  This is another rally sleeper that has matured into a very good simulation.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can't believe an offically license game can be so bad. Its an embarassment to the WRC series.I sucked it up, and decided to at least get some achievements. In trying to complete them, I have found the online side on a new game is completely dead. I will update more as I go along.Does not support my wheel. Menu mapping is for a controller. I am using 3 seperate usbs for my setup. One for pedals and hand brake, one for my wheel, and one for my shifter.Fanatec CRS Elite Pedal base with Hand brakeFanatec Porsch GT3 RS V2.2 Generic Usb controller for my Happ 6 speed shifter.It should at least support my wheel and pedals. but rally is kinda pointless without a shifter or handbrake.The worst part is I got this from a 3rd party souce so I am not even eligable for a refund.If you plan on useing a wheel, you are screwed. If you are ok with an xbox controller, then proceed at your own risk.EDIT: UpdateIts messed up how what was suppose to be an exclusive car is not anymore. If I had known it wasn't truly exclusive I would not have got the game from an outside source. I had no intent on using the ""Fantasy Car"" , but the perks of having exclusive content was my final determining factor.If I had not bought the game from an outside source (Greenman) I could ask for a refund. So this car is the reason I am stuck with a broken game.All I have wanted more than anything out of rally games is to have a true to life accurate recreation. This game is an embarrassment to the rally genre. Dirt Rally is leaps and bounds better than this.			",58,2,33,2,7,0,0

												I absolutely love this game.  It looks real nice and the immersion in both the car and the course is incredible. Compared to other rally games, which to some degree I like them all, this is like project cars in the rally world. I mean in the actual driving and feel of the game. I play about every car game out there and this is right up there for me...light years beyond previous WRC games. I use an old MS Sidewinder FF wheel with tocaedit360 emulator in the game directory (mapping my wheel like an xbox360 controller) and about 15 minutes in I had it dialed and loving it. Hope that helps. Cheers			",373,80,56,19,30,7,24

												There is something really wrong with this game, i love the graphics but the gameplay and the cars handling is just awful. i like simulation but this does things that no car ever do, i dont know why and i've tried everything. For me the handling is the worst part here, handling was good in wrc 4 and my hopes were high. Now i got Dirt Rally and i'm just gonna delete wrc 5. thank you			",17,1,5,0,0,0,0

												I have now played for 4 hours and this gane sucks, the car handling is pathatic, the logitech G27 steering wheel wont register in the game so i cant even use my wheel, dirt3 and dirt rally the wheel works WRC 5 no wheel, i agree with everything Rally-RacingIvysaur said in he's comments.My advice would be to all rally lovers don't waist your money on this garbage, not running properly, not tested properly, and not worth releasing.Sorry but i wont be keeping this game at all and i own 110 games on steam and never asked for a refund from any of them, but this garbage i will ask for refund.

												Can't believe how a developer can let a game go and move on to the next installment. The last update (patch) 12/11/2015, seriously. It has to be the worst game i have played in regards to Rallye. I wish a refund was in order for this game. Highly disappointed . But as it seems i am stuck with it ,very sad to see a potential game go down the tubes.			",0,0,7,0,0,0,0

												This is a Decent Game but inferior to some other racing titles! The Graphics are nothing special but good enough i suppose and it does have very good controls and handling.I recommend only if its on sale 6/10			",530,144,34,44,36,4,40

												In my opinion this is far the best rally game since the epic Colling McRae2.0. Very Nice graphics and no silly story: just hardcore rally driving with respect for the real rally rules. People who are used to visit in real life rally stages shall admit that this game is close to what rally really is.			",0,0,5,0,0,0,0

												Well can't play this anymore.  I installed it and played a few hours - it was fun.  Shut it down and now get the Error Initializing Game.The graphics card is not compatible with Directx 9.Please contact your dealer.Well it is a GTX1080 on a Windows 10 64-bit machine.  I get this error regardless of selecting Directx 11 or 9 to start, or if I try to start it from the app file.  This is a giant turd of a game now.  No one seems to have any idea why this happens or how to fix it.  I have uninstalled and reinstalled the game twice with the same results.Will try to get my $10 back from Steam.

												Broken PC release, avoid.-Cannot change all of the button inputs on the controller = MAJOR EPIC ♥♥♥♥ING FAILThe major blow is this.-Feels like that the framerate runs at locked 50-59. Tried G-Sync on and off at 50Hz (most playable but this is 2016 for ♥♥♥♥ sake), 60 and 75Hz and it all lags. Adaptive v- sync was attemted to no success.- Crashes 1-3 times when starting the game about directx 9 failed to bla bla bla bla when directx 11 is enabled in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. It works when it ♥♥♥♥ing wants to.Tried to make it worthwile for 20 minutes...uninstalled the crap.WRC 4 is less broken and 100% playable.			",64,5,5,2,1,0,0

												Only played the game for a few hours and see that it is not good! Mainly the instructions are too slow which timely instructions is fairly important in a Rally. You are told there is a hairpin or a blind intersection and it is too late to brake for it. The other frustrating thing is that I cannot find any place to resart a leg in the career mode. Realism isn't too bad but all it takes is an interuption while playing and you have screwed your time if you don't pause quickly enough. If there is a way to restart without starting a whole new career, please let me know.			",5,0,29,0,5,0,0

												Control via keyboard is awful. Very big delay in response to pressing of key made this game useless for me. And it can not be fixed with controls' sensitivity settings. I think I spent my money for nothing (((((. If steam had added feature to try the game before buying I would never buy it. (((			",15,0,2,0,0,0,1
