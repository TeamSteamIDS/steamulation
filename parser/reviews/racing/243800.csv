												You remember all these times you were playing a 'regular' racing game and that ""!$%@ car passed you right before the finish line? Of course it blocked the whole road and you were out of nitro so in the end you were only able to score the infamously annoying 2nd place...Well 'Gas Guzzlers' solves this problem by adding some machine guns, shotguns or some friggin rockets to your car. An opponent is right in front of your car and blocks the way? Here it's a perfect opportunity to pump some metal into this target on wheels and turn it into a burning pile of scrap. EAT THIS! It's definitley a very entertaining and quite solid arcade/action-racer with several fictional cars, routes and weapons, that features many interesting gaming modes as well as a small tuning system and... Zombies (DLC)! I mean hunting zombies with a nice sports car and some built in shotguns: That's the real manly way to do it!Sure the cars don't drive very smoothly, there is no real story in the campaign mode, the music is just some generic rock stuff, there is no splitscreen (and the multiplayer is kind of empty) and the whole concept is copied from several other games but it is combined quite well, makes a lot of fun and is at least worth to look at in a Sale. It's like the indie child of 'FlatOut', 'Mario Kart' and 'Twisted Metal'. The one with Zombies. And rockets. And railguns. The one you always wanted because of... (explosive) reasons!

												""Very nische racing type of game, yet entartaining as nothing else.""There has been not many games that actually have cars and weapons mixed together. This type of racing game is pretty ""nische"" and there were games in the past (Road Wars for example) that did it nicely. This one is new, fresh, and does it stand up to the great game name? That question is pretty tough, but in my honest opinion - yes it does. Previous Gas Guzzlers was plagued by loads of problems: from barely working controls, via terrible physics, to horrible optimisation. This one as sequel on the other hand, does everything better, as expected. Game starts you with sponsored car. You get the money by winning races. The more races you win, the more money you get. Also winning unlocks cars, upgrades, rims, stickers and weapons, but this happens every 3-4 races. There is a lot to do in single player, however, the beginning of the campaign is pretty slow, and boring, but it does get better as you progress more. In the race you have various objectives that can give you more money, like ""destroy x amount of cars in 1 lap"". This adds variety to the gameplay and does add the replay value to the game. Graphics are much better. They are shiny (but it's not overdone) colourful, with nice shadows and particle effects. Models look nice, and most of cars are based on their real counterparts which is good, but they have really cheesy names. Overall game has really cheesy humour, which could be considered childish, but for me, it doesn't matter, but let's get back to technical stuff. Damage done to cars is somewhat 'meh' but it does job well on harder difficulties. Ai does it's job too. They're challenging, they are intelligent and they use their weapons with caution and can be deadly sometimes. Optimisation here is also better than previous one. I have mid-range PC and 60FPS all the time on ultra settings, which is amazing. There are many options to customise so you won't be dissapointed. Sound departament delivers funny yet very high quality sounds, for example there are voice-overs from Duke Nukem (!) which is a nice touch (they sound exactly like duke!), engines have that ""punch"" and differ from car to car... Just awesome. Music is outstanding, some heavy metal tunes over there, but opinions may vary here.Controls are improved, as it should be done in sequel. Car instantly responds to your commands, they have feel of weight, but at the same time they handle well. I had no problems handling the cars. Keep in mind that every car handles differently, and there are noticable differencies between all of them. Same goes to weapons. Some can shoot even backwards, which is awesome. There are some powerups on map such as repair, oil that you can spill on the track, mines etc. It all works together very well.Multiplayer is a typical madness. Capture the Flag, Deathmatch, Last Man Standing. Just Awesome. Too bad that nobody plays this game on MP which is shame because it's so much fun even with bots. Runs fluid smooth, has no lag issues, so what's the matter?There are some flaws. Sometimes Ai runs in circles when FPS goes down on older PC's. There were some problems for me with my steering wheel, but I got them resolved, and mentioned above slow single player campaign start which is annoying and can make you bored of game quickly if you won't get new car soon. I also wish for more cars, and weapons. There were some problems with achievements, but other than that, I had no glitches.Game is good for what it is. It does entertain you, and it does it pretty well. Question is, is it worth 22,99? For me, yes, for others looking for a realistic racing game - not really. Buckle up, this is going to be hell of a ride!8/10			",399,73,42,34,51,7,45

												This game needs more love. It is Fun, Fast Paced, and full of action. Gas Guzzlers leans into the shooter and battle aspects, but there are straight races to be had, in addition to Arena Deathmatches and Elimination Races. There is a significant single player experience and online bots to get you started.  if you enjoyed Twisted Metal, or the Flatout series, you will likely enjoy this immensely. 8.5 / 10			",322,23,14,10,34,4,49

												Vehicular combat racers come in many shapes. Futuristic hovercraft blowing each other up was made legendary in the Wipeout series and psychotic characters driving contemporary vehicles made blowing your friends up a blast in Twisted Metal. Gas Guzzlers Extreme is a good, old-fashioned vehicular combat racer which brings nothing new to the table but adds a new title to a solid and entertaining genre.The realistic thing about Gas Guzzlers Extreme is that you play as a redneck who has been recruited to race in a tournament created by rednecks for rednecks and, let’s face it, if anyone would be dumb enough to strap weapons on their cars and race around shooting at each other it would be rednecks.For fans of games like Flatout the amount of vehicles may be a bit small but coupled with a number of engine and weapon upgrades and the ability to customise the look of the car, there is ample opportunity to make the eighteen vehicles on stock completely your own. Cosmetic upgrades are free of charge and completing races will unlock new stickers and rims for your car. Engine, brake, and weapon upgrades, however, cost money which you earn during the race by finishing in a top spot, destroying enemy cars, performing daredevil stunts, and completing bonus objectives.Scattered throughout the tracks are weapons and boosts waiting to be picked up by the first car to hit them.The weapons available range from machine guns and shotguns to plutonium tipped rockets and some can fire both forward and backwards.As you can see, there is nothing really new about it, but the levels are very well designed and they come in seven different settings, ranging from dry deserts to snow covered mountains. None of the tracks I raced on was irritatingly complicated or idiotically simple, so the design team deserves complements for hitting a nice middle route in that regard. Races are tight and exciting and the AI functions very much like you would expect a real racer to behave.The graphics are adequate and the sound design is good but where the experience truly excels is music. The rock tracks that play during races blend perfectly into the action and boost the already heart-pounding excitement of the race.The game’s sense of humour is also a nice touch and everything from the track and bot names to the driver dancing the hula with a tire while you customise your car in the garage put a smile on your face both during and between races.This game is a welcome addition to the combat racing genre and although it adds nothing new to it, it holds up well against games like Twisted Metal. This genre is severely under-served on the PC and I encourage anyone who enjoyed the likes of Interstate ‘76 to pick this game up.			",2249,864,87,235,309,22,348

												Car combat has been the red headed stepchild of video game genres almost since its inception. The rash of Twisted Metal clones that came in the early days soured many, and even Sweet Tooth and the gang haven’t had the best track record as of late. Last generation, Burnout took up the car chaos crown, with its traffic checking and Crash Mode, but the developers got lost in Paradise City and are now toiling away at the endless barrage of samey Need For Speed titles. Gas Guzzlers Extreme, a new entry in the genre by Gamepires, isn’t going to set the world on fire, mostly due to its lack of flamethrowers. However, the game does strike a nice balance between the crash heavy races of Burnout and the heat seeking missiles of Twisted Metal that any fan of the genre should take notice of.I wrote more about it in my full review, available over on Geekenstein.com: http://www.geekenstein.com/gas-guzzlers-extreme-review/ ",2858,996,116,291,324,33,437

												It's a lot like Flatout, while your goal often is to finish first, boost is key to getting past all the cars, and you will get boost by crashing into things and other drivers. Then you have the option to blow up other cars with an array of guns which is fun. Cars look good and are inspired by real life cars and you unlock upgrades for them during the campaign. The campaign consists of a straight line of races where you can pick between race, racing with shooting, elimination and also death match later on.All races have challenges which spice up the fun and rewards you with extra money but the challenges are sometimes very hard to pull off. I would recommend this game if you are looking for something fun, just don't expect anything else like deep story elements.			",472,89,18,46,21,3,45

												One of the best game i've ever played in a long time.Remind me a lot of interstate 76 with a mix of DeathRally with the AAA graphics of the today’s games.TONS of customization, LOTS of weapons, cars, stickers, well the games let you customise TONS of awesome cars.You start with a 1959 3 wheeler car, and you buy and buy more cars. Tons of references too.If you like Interstate 76, Burnout or anything that lets you customise cars, with HUGE guns, and have plenty of fun in an ARENA or around A BIG GIANT CASTLE with friends or versus both with a solo mode that have tons of cups that LET YOU CHOOSE the mode you want to play to progress in solo or in multi (There’s even a capture the flag).This game is for you, even if you think it’s not for you, i’m not a big fan of racing games… but you surely gonna like it.You can select if you want the game to be more arcade or realist with the car reacting differently to the environement.The AI is ajustable, no abusive rubberbanding AI like many game have.Also possibility to select your profile, so you can start another campaign without losing your progrss.Awesome multiplayer mode, even having capture the flag mode.The game is awesome. The only thing the game need is Steam workshop.			",1864,608,106,223,272,42,321

												If you like the flatout serious but you think it could have had little more action, this might be the right game for you. Totally underrated game, being a mixture between a racer and a shooter. Fast paced, good multiplayer, lots of game modes, cars and weapons.Unfortunately there are not that many people playing this game online at any point in time. On the week-ends, it's okay, which means there's like 1-2 full lobbies. It supports dedicated servers as well, so you don't have to fear that you can't play online anymore when the publisher shuts their servers down.			",104,33,3,12,8,2,19

												Really hope the developers have something new coming up. This game is awesome, something I've been looking for since Vigilante 8. Even though it's racing and not just car combat, the racing part of it is still very enjoyable.Capture the flag is quite competitive, you're not always just with crap AI, they do actually help.- Lots of upgrades, unlocks, races and cars- Beautiful visuals- Great humor - Great AI, can be rather challenging- Shortcuts on various tracks, always something to look for.- Hazards on the roads, explosive barrels, oil cans.Overall, if you're looking for a great arcade racer, with guns just like the old days. This is certainlly for you.Note to developers - You've done extremely well, please keep at it and come out with a sequel. Love to see what you could all come up with :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fantastic multiplayer game.  If you want a racing game with simple handling and over the top guns then this is a fantastic choice.  Admittedly single player might get boring after a few hours (although racing against hard AI is a surprisingly deep experience).  However the multiplayer creates fantastic moments and memories.DLC is great value if you enjoy this game.  Zombies is especially hilarious fun with mates.If you have friends who are keen to play this with you it is a brilliant buy.In short, worth considering as a single player racer.Definitely worth the buy if you have friends to play with.EDIT:Didn't expect this review to get noticed.  Thought I should mention multiplayer with strangers is very rare, however there are official servers so its easy to organise a game with friends.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Car combat games can be hit or miss, and I'm very happy to say that Gas Guzzlers Extreme is a hit through and through. The game features a single player campaign spanning over three separate championships and a multitude of races leading up to unlocking said championships, in which you can pick and choose which type of race you'd like to play. You have your classic race with no weapons other than specials (mines, smoke, oil spills, and the like), battle races (where you must complete so many laps and stay alive while trying to kill your opponents), and knock out races (number of laps equals number of opponents, and you can either win by killing everyone else or completing the laps remaining). Over time, you'll unlock some fantastic game modes such as deathmatch (whoever kills 10 other cars first wins), capture the flag (my personal favorite, where you must capture a flag and drive it to the other flag, which in many cases is picked up by the opposing team; death and explosions ensue),and last man standing (eight cars spawn on the map, kill and try not to die until you're the last). You can pick and choose from whichever game modes you want to play, earning points to further your standing. If you find classic races boring, you don't have to play them at all (other than one per championship), which is a pretty cool feature.The cars control great, and differentiate a bit between one another. You have options to upgrade your car's body, weapons, and paint job, even down to what color your license plate is. There are quite a bit of cars to pick from, and many unlock during your journey through the campaign. The cars are not licensed, but are made to appear like real branded cars (the car The Matador, for example, shares the likeness of the Lamborghini Aventador). The settings screen allows you a variety of options, including turning cursing off, which I did simply because I liked having the option (this also would make this game suitable for children, as other than the cursing, there is no blood or graphic violence other than explosions, which are fun for the whole family). I beat the game's entire campaign in about nine hours, but it doesn't have to end there if you don't want it to. The game also features multiplayer for those who like to play online (not my cup of tea, personally, so I did not check this option out), quick races, and you can even continue in the campaign like normal, sans championships. For those who only play single player like myself, don't fret. The game's AI is some of the best AI I've ever seen in a game of any genre, and I'm not exaggerating. The AI in this will not let you win easily, and their ruthlessness in battle is what made capture the flag so fun and memorable for me. I did not notice any rubberbanding, however. The AI will mess up like you do, driving over mines and crashing into each other, keeping the game fair, yet challenging.The game doesn't feature a very memorable soundtrack, but it's not terrible by any means, and the music that plays during upgrading sessions reminded me a lot of Fallout 3. The graphics of the game are pretty great for 2013, other than some blurry background textures that you shouldn't be paying attention to anyway. The only two negatives I have for this game are that for one thing, I never did figure out how to use the smoke special every single time I picked it up. It seemed finicky, like it would only work a third of the time you legitimately picked it up, so I'm not sure if it had a cooldown or what. The second negative would be that although you can pick between multiple game modes throughout the campaign, the race tracks seem to randomize, and you often have to play some of the same tracks quite often, despite unlocking new ones nearly every race. Also, if you are wanting to play a certain game mode but don't want to play on the track it offers, you can't switch the track within that game mode. You'd either have to suck it up or play a different mode (the latter of which I usually did, since they all are fantastic). Gas Guzzlers Extreme is a fantastic game that should belong to every racing fan, and it serves as a great ""learning tool"" for those gamers who are looking for a good intro game to the car combat genre, as its options and various difficulties make the game approachable for genre veterans and beginners alike. It's one of those games you'll keep on your hard drive even after you beat it, because it's an easy game to drop in and drop out of. I would personally rate this a 9/10. I was looking for a car combat game that would make my heart race and fulfill my need for destruction and explosions, and Gas Guzzlers Extreme did so in every regard.			",461,269,16,130,96,2,166

												This game is fantastic. Normally racing games aren't my thing, but with this vehicular car combat game it is a recipe for destruction, and I love it. The guns are satisfying, the cars drive really nicely, and the game looks really nice.What shook me was the devs asking me to do voice acting for them, and after a few trial runs had my voice accepted into the game.

 It might not be very original, but it is fun and very easy to pick up. I started to play like 15 Hours in Multiplayer with my brother and some friends. Damn... its fun to just stump my Friends with a freaking lazergun on my car and hear them scream: ""OOHH MAAA GAAAD! WHAT WAS THAAAT WTF""hahaha. This game is pure fun! Singleplayer is fun too! Its the typical race Story mode, where you get sponsor and money to upgrade your car like in need for speed. Its fun! Not original but does a great job in what its supposed to be.

												If ever a game was either made FOR Jeremy Clarkson, or BY Jeremy Clarkson, this is the one! Racing in Lamborghini's armed with miniguns and rocket launchers while also being able to lay mines, oil slicks and smoke trails... and racing against drivers such as Luke Likesheet, Alotta Fagina and Jenny Talia... This has Clarkson and Top Gear all over it!I can't recommend this game highly enough! Graphically very good, audio is also very good, and the main feature, the gameplay itself, is superb! I love the black humour and it is very easy to lose all track of time while playing this... so while you may intend to only have a couple of short races, the next thing you know it's 3 hours later. The variety in the difficulty levels are perfect, so this game is fine for racing gamers of any skill level. Progression through the game is set at a good rate so you rarely find yourself having to wait for new cars, weapons, upgrades or tracks to become available, nor do you find yourself lagging behind the other racers because you can't afford the upgrades to compete.I'm a huge fan of racing games, and while this is as far removed from a serious racer as it gets, it is also one of the most enjoyable racing games i have ever played! You MUST buy this game!			",211,16,19,31,27,0,62

												Oh man....this is as adrenaline pumping a racing game as I have played. In addition to the kick♥♥♥♥♥soundtrack, the cars are beefy in an arcadey way, the tracks are fun and often challenging, and the guns....oh man the guns!So, there are a few different race modes (all the racing standards really), but in addition to all the standards, there is also deathmatch. DEATHMATCH! That is balls out crazy bad assedness! There is also capture the flag (which is pretty much deathmatch with an obvious objective added).The campaign mode (so far as I have gotten) involves moving up through the rankings while buying new cars, upgrades, weapons and of course tricking out your cars as well. Each race features three modes to choose from (typically standard race, battle (with guns), and elimination). It's as simple as that.You can select a cheeseball voice for your racer and s/he comments throughout. I chose Arnold, and get some laughs out of it. So, in addition to the guns (THE GUNS!!!!), there are also pickups such as smoke, oil, mines, etc....flapjacks happen to be one of them lol...that you can then drop to mess up the other drivers. There is also nitro for that extra boost. You obviously have a myriad of ways to destroy your fellow racers, not the least of which include good old fashioned ramming. You can also pick up buffs like shields and double damage along the way. All are obviously single use or timed (depending on the type of pick up).Multiplayer features all the modes in a seven race round robin of sorts. They are team oriented, and if you play with somebody you know, you can definitely incorporate tactics into the matches to increase your odds of winning. There weren't a ton of players online when I played last night, but it was still a ton of fun and the game populates the matches with bots to fill them out if you don't have all 8 players to fill a server. The bots are actually pretty solid players as well lol.I would say this may go down as my fave racer. It is intuitive and easy to grasp, but still rewards practice. It has fun tracks, cool guns and upgrades, and no small amount of humor involved (outside of the voices, you might have a blow up doll or president bust passenger in your car, you might find penguins on the track, etc....).Definitely must own, must play.Do Eet. Do Eet Nowwww!!!!9 skid marks/run over penguins out of 10			",2039,1022,52,316,205,18,280

												When I bought my first gaming PC 20 days ago, I got this game plus 3 others from the CroTeam for free. First thing I installed was Gas Guzzlers Extreme as I was a big fan of Vigilante VIII and similar vehicular combat games. Although its not Vigilante VIII or Twisted Metal in its essence, it is coming pretty close to it and I was very satisfied overall. Pros:1. Graphics are excellent, both enviroments and cars. Many tracks and lots of cars.2. Physics are very satisfying as you can wreck lots of things and lose a lot of car parts in progress.3. I was never hardcore into racing except for Need for speed Underground 2, but racing itself is pretty nice, had no problems with the driving model.4. Combat ofcourse. Feels nice when you blow up your oponnent to pieces during the fullspeed or smahing them in the arena.5. Game modes. Incredible variety of modes. There is something for everyone: Capture the flag, zombie defense, deathmatch, regular racing, battle racing, team deathmatch... almost endless6. AI. If you play singleplayer and need a challenge, by choosing from 4 different difficulties, you will be challenged.7. If you have a group of friends to play this game with, multiplayer is just awesome, you can lose a lot of time to it.8. Optimization. There are plenty of graphics settings if you are struggling to reach your desired FPS.Cons:1. Multiplayer: As this game didn't have a lot of marketing and its developed by a really small team in Croatia, its not very known. Because of that, it is difficult to find others to play it with. I've been lucky and found a group of Americans.2. No splitscreen. As there are not so many players online, it would be nice to have splitscreen. I was sad as I could not play it with my friend when he came over to my house.I would recommend this game if you are looking for some combat on wheels. Its a quality game!			",37,19,0,1,3,3,12

												Gas Guzzlers Extreme gives you the option of playing a full blown career mode, a single race to learn the controls or an old-school arcade mode.There are a huge number of different cars that will immediately be very familiar. While none of them use the real names it’s obvious what they are.Another thing that you will notice about the cars is that they mostly seem to be iconic vehicles from the world of TV and film. You have cars based on K.I.T.T. from Knight Rider, the General Lee from Dukes of Hazard, the three-wheeler van from Only Fools And Horses, the Renault from Pink Panther and even the DeLorean from Back To The Future.When it comes to the races themselves they are split into three main categories; Knockout, Battle and Power Race.Within these main modes are also some sub-categories such as team battles, arena death matches, capture the flag and arena battles. One you get further into the game they also throw a load of zombies into the mix if you get Full Metal Zombie DLC.New weapons can be bought via the garage and extra ammo can be picked up around each track. Your car is also equipped with a nitro booster and this can be upgraded and replenished in the same way.  It’s also possible to simply ram opponents.Graphically Gas Guzzlers Extreme looks pretty damn great. The engine is fast and smooth and I haven’t noticed any glitches or screen tearing.Gas Guzzlers Extreme is great game to relax and just let your mind rest while you crush and shoot enemies with various weapons.

												Hands down gas guzzlers got to be the best combat racing game ever made, competitive to the bone, fun and awesome! Oh and criminaly underrated. I don't know why people complain about the graphics, because they look great, the usic is spectacular and also You can even choose Duke Nukem's voice as your pilot's voice, what more do you want :D I can't believe it's online playerbase is so very small. I mean, there are times when a room gets full - 8 players - and it's incredible fun, but also a rare event. The standard as of now is more likely 0-3 players playing online when I check in. More people should get it cause the game is really amazing!			",248,25,31,6,3,0,11

												There have been three truly great automotive combat games since people started trying to convert Car Wars into a video game: Autoduel, the original Twisted Metal, and now this title. This should have been one of the big games of the last year, but somehow it slipped past most of us. There is a ton of content here, and it's all AAA quality and execution. (Well, except for the names. As the title of the game may suggest to you, these people are TERRIBLE at naming things. Just terrible. It's painful. I'm not kidding.) Right now this is $3.45 on Humble. That's a steal. Highly recommended at any price point!As usual, feel free to friend me for multiplayer.			",90,6,5,13,14,2,32

												This is a fairly straightforward combat racing game.  While it is a console port, controls can be customised to make the game playable.A wide range of graphics options allow for modern PC's to be used effectively.   The game runs smoothly and looks well enough in 4K. Gameplay is fairly entertaining, pretty much what you expect from games of this genre.   While not the best example of the genre, and lacking a very wide array of vehicles and maps, it's adequate enough and doesn't have any drawbacks, so there's simply no reason to thumb this down.

												If someone ask whats the best racing game of 2013, it is definitely Gas Guzzlers Extreme to meThe game career is split into 3 tiers, each tier has a set of cars and tracks. The higher tier has more tracks but the game seem to have 4 environment only. Every race you win gets you cash to buy or upgrade your car, there isn't much ginding in the game since the money win per race is sufficient for you to buy multiple cars and upgrade them. Every race in the game has additional objective for you to complete, completing them will grant you extra cash. Objective such as: Kill Stu Pitt by smashing or be the first in every lap or get most kills in the race and etc. The career is filled with 3 game type at the start, power race which is like normal races with no weapons (is boring), battle race which let you use guns (great fun!) and there is knockout race where the last racer gets eliminated every lap or you can blow up your oppenent to get them out of the race (this is pretty challenging). Later in the game has last man standing which is like a demolition derby from FlatOut but with guns! There is a death match mode as well in tier 3 where the first person to score 10 kills wins the match. In both Last Man Standing and Deathmatch mode, the player start with no weapon but they always have a random weapon for you to pick up in front of you. You can pick multiple weapons and swap between them in this game modes. After a few wins in a row, you'll be given a sponsor livery for you to put on your car, having the livery installed on your car will grant you additional cash and when there is a sponsor event you'll be invited to race in it. I only went through 1 sponsor event (I prefer the custom livery than the sponsor livery but it seems like you need sponsor livery to unlock sponsor event), it is a team race. It is simple, keep your team in front and stop/blow up your enemy when they try to take your team's lead. The other event I saw is a team death match, there is a total of 3 teams in the match and the first team to get 30 kills wins the match. Sponsor events brings a lot more cash than the usual races. For the career mode, there isn't a fixed career structure. You can play the entire tier until the tournament unlocked by playing power race only if you want, the game dont force you to race a specific race mode that you may dislike, the only time it forces you to play through a specific race mode is in the tournament, you have to play each mode once. You progress the game career by climbing a leaderboard, the tournament is unlocked once you reach the first position of the leaderboard, the game dont force you to enter the tournament either, you can continue earning money for your upgrades even after you unlock the tournament. The AIs in the game is challenging, they are fast and it is definitely better than the typical NFS games AI, there are about 6 difficulty setting in the game.The tracks are great, large wide tracks with a lot of room to run and dodge the bullets and there are some which are tighter and more twisty tracks which is much more challenging. The cars drives pretty well, not the best driving physic since all the cars feels the same but it is still fun. The weapons variety is great, it ranges from shotguns, machine gun, mini gun, rocket launcher, grenade launcher, gauss rifle and homing missles. I'll recommend anyone to this game if they are looking for a great arcade combat racer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Edit: Oh this is lovely, like all indie developers who get bad reviews, the two for this game both gave me ""did not find this review useful"" then now told me that the reason I found the campaign to be repetative was because I hadn't played it enough yet. What total nonsense. They claimed that playing death matches or capture the flag would make the game more fun. I played both (specifically where I said ""Multiplayer games against bots"") and they were still not fun. Edit 2: I've checked the steam page for Gas Guzzlers and there's not one negative review with over 50% of people who found it useful.Huge redflag. Out of a 100 negatives reviews there's none with constructive criticism deemed useful ? I call BS.I'm giving this a thumbs down because I don't believe its worth the $24.99 price tag. At first, the game is a lot of fun and its really satisfying when you blow up your first car. The problem is that this is one of the most repetitive games I've ever played. You'll end up in first most the time, trying to decide whether you should slam the breaks to kill people and break the monotany or just go for an easy win. The ""campaign"" consists of 1. Race with no weapons 2. Race with weapons3. Race with weapons, but whoever is in last place gets taken out at the end of each lap. 4. Play multiplayer games against bots when the game decides its a special occassion. You'll play dozens of these races and feel like you aren't getting anywhere. New cars don't unlock often enough to keep things interesting, a sponsorship insures that you'll have about 5x as much money as you can possibly use, and its just agonizingly boring to win 5 races and be told CONGRATULATIONS! YOU UNLOCKED....1 NEW RIM AND 1 NEW STICKER! This game is fun for about an hour or two, but around the time you reach the first championship, you'll start to ask yourself why you're wasting your time driving in circles (alwasy in first place) when you could be playing Twisted Metal, Mad Max, or any number of car combat games.

A Great Action Car GameWith many different weapons to equip your car with, there is much fun to be had shooting and destroying your opponents vehicles whether it be with your friends or other players in multiplayer mode, or against the AI in one of the the many game modes this game has to offer.The sound and graphics are great in this game and the gameplay feels relatively smooth.The only minor setback for this game is that getting/setting up a game in multiplayer isn't as simple as it should be, since you have to set up your own server in a different window and then go back into gas guzzlers. However once that is all sorted out then the experience is quite good.Considering this game gets discounted by a fair bit during the sales, it is definitely worth picking this game up and having a go with your friends.

												You know, yes I am from Croatia - and this is made in Croatia game and I like it, not only because I support developers from my small (but most attractive looking) country, but also because game is simply awesome - I was always liking Flatout based games but this is something new and much better in my opinion to any Flatout based games. Gas Guzzlers Extreme game has its unique humor - which is really awesome. And game is cheap in price and you'll get tons of fun if you buy it - but you won't regret it I am sure. P.S - since I don't wanna to write much about negatives, because you can't find them easily at all on this game, but there's one little annoying thing is that finding multiplayer games is for now still pretty hard thing to do - it's pretty hard to find populated multiplayer servers for now, but I am sure this is gonna change in the future.Greetings from Slavonia, Croatia!

												The best Combat Racing game available on Steam. My only complaints are that there's usually not many people online and I think it could benefit with more car customisation in multiplayer - earning cash during multiplayer races to trick out your chosen car would make this more appealing in my opinion as there isn't much difference between how each car handles or performs.Otherwise, this game is definitely in my top 10 of the past decade.

With a good variety of vehicles, weapons, tracks, and a number of modes both focused around pure racing, pure combat, and some level of variation between the two. The cars control nicely, drifting is slick, boosting feels appropriately fast. Definitely worth picking up, in my opinion, if you have some friends to go play with for good fun. Can support up to 8 players online. Be weary though, the AI love to tail you and shoot shotguns up your♥♥♥♥♥			",2618,1267,69,244,264,20,256

Product received for free
												after owning this for over a year and playing it off and on in this time (before the first DLC released) - i must say without hesitation or negativity on any other game in the genres part - this is the most underrated car racing/destruction/replayability on the market today.  so few people know about this gem, and its even harder to get someone to give it a try!  well worry no more, the dev's like to think ahead, and by doing so made a demo.  if you are unsure about the content, you can try the demo for free!  how many games have demos nowadays?  a good 90% or higher ratio do not.  this will keep you coming back for years to come, as well as some of the most fun you've ever had in a race/deathmatch.  If you were a fan of games like Twisted metal and Vigilante 8 back in the day, this is like a combination of the two mixed with some of the recent need for speed games.  it has all the variations, race types and options you could ever dream of (save maybe 1 or 2 things which were so minor i cannot remember, and does not affect the product in any way) on top of racing/destroying with friends in a cooperative enviroment.  and if i remember correctly, at the time of its release (even to today) its the only online racing game which features fully functional and fully customizeable AI opponents while online. if you call yourself a 'gamer' and have not tried GGE, you sir/mam are no gamer at heart.  being a 'gamer' involves loving and trying all genres of games, instead of just sticking to 1.  so if you consider yourself one, give this a try, it even has a demo with limited content to give you the idea of what you are in for.  so there is no reason not to try it, my gamer friend.

												Update on review.. I have played the game a bit more and I really like it. I like the corny ai names like Jack Kass, Yuri Diculous, etc.. I like the graphics.. and most of all I enjoy the gameplay. If you thought Post Apocalyptic Mayhem was O.K. then this game is way better. This game is actually fun and has plently of online modes; such as battle modes-last man standing and team modes vs. racing with weapons and without and a good capture the flag mode unlike playing a fps. Only problme is not many human players. but able to vote in the servers and add and remove bots. They also added voice support but I think its always on so unless you ahve a mute button for your mic kinda annoying. great game. Also the music is awesome!!			",271,14,47,4,6,7,16

												This game is pretty awesome. It delivers on so many different levels with AAA execution but for some reason is overlooked by many. The amount of content you get at the low price point is unbelievable and the dlc is well worth it's low price too. The amount of cars and upgrades you can do combined with the several different game modes and tracks will keep you busy for some time. If you have been looking to relive the old twisted metal days then this is for you. If you're looking to destroy some cars and do some racing then this is for you. The only thing on the lower end is the amount of people that play online which really doesn't take anything away from the amazing single player. However I'm always looking for new people to shred some metal and fiberglass with so feel free to add me if you want in some fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Steam says me that I have it, but I just can't play it (if someone know why, and how to fix that, tell me).Meanwhile, I rated the game itself positive, and if I could, I would multiple kill the like button, because it's an AWESOME game made of scrap metal, bad jokes, bullets, explosions, chickens, and fun, and that's why every fan of Burnout, Jack X, or simply cars 'n guns should have it and love it every day of his life. May be a bit short in story mode, but there is MULTIPLAYER, and if you come here with your buddies, BE PREPARED FOR WW3/4/5/THE RETURN OF THE JEDI AND well you get it. Move your♥♥♥♥♥outta there and go for money to buy this piece of metal art.			",22,0,3,0,5,0,1

												Over the years, I've enjoyed automotive racing/combat games such as INTERSTATE '76, DEATH RALLY, and TEST DRIVE:EVE OF DESTRUCTION.  GAS GUZZLERS EXTREME does a fine job of continuing the tradition.The graphics are excellent on more modern machines.  Gameplay is challenging but still enjoyable, as the difficulty setting is adjustable.  Vehicle control is good.  I will point out that the tracks are rife with sharp turns, so handling is an important as speed as you drive.  At the same time, one mistake by itself will not cost you a race.  There are a variety of weapon types to suit your combat preferences.  Shotguns and machine guns appear to be the most effective for races, but there are also missile launchers, grenade launchers, and even a delayed-reaction railgun for more exotic gameplay.  There are also droppable weapons (mines, smoke, and oil slicks).  In this regard, the game reminds me of Origin Systems' AUTODUEL.Adding to the fun is a wide variety of vehicle models.  These range from classic American muscle and sport cars to exotic performance models from Europe and Japan.The game's general tone appears heavily inspired by DEATH RALLY and DUKE NUKEM.  I mention the latter because some of the track and opponent names feature puns with a decidedly adult sense of humor.  Parents with young children or the easily offended should beware.  Overall, GAS GUZZLERS EXTREME is a very enjoyable game, and I recommend it to anyone wishing to scratch the automotive combat itch.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For older gamers who remember Interstate '76 and Interstate '82, this game will seem familiar.  That is not to say that they are terribly similar, it is just the ""feel"" is hard to deny. Having bought it as a time-waster that I could play with the family, I was quite pleasantly suprised at how engaging the game is.  You just want to keep racing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												1- GENERALGas Guzzlers Extreme is a racing and combat game.The game presents itself with a lot of content for a racing game. You have the usual stuff, like career mode, quick race, multiplayer (which is almost empty), but inside of those you can ad a lot more.In career mode you start with one car and you will unlock the others during your progress. Upgrades can be bought with the money earned in the races. You can customize paint jobs, rims and even the license plate. Guns can be added to the car, shield, new exhaust or engine... the world is not enough.I should say that the game does not have real licensed cars, but imagine chinese copies of famous cars. You are wright. All the cars are blatant copies of real cars, and you will spend some time guessing which is which.The graphics are OK. We know this is not a AAA game, but the textures are quite nice and detailed. The cars are very well designed. Keep in mind that this is not Gran Turismo, but the creators have a nice and polished game.2- GAMEPLAYSurprisingly this game has quite a nice handling. The physics of the car are not perfect, but very acceptable for a combat game. The AI is very nice, and hard to beat even at medium levels. There are some nice toutches like the funny AI names, and the option to choose from different types of commentaries. I've choose to have Duke Nukem commenting my races. It's quite fun.There are some different game modes:* Power race: a straightforward race, with no weapons or combat envolved;* Battle race: a normal race but with weapons and the possibility to knock out opponents;* Knockout: 8 guys in an arena, the last one alive wins;* Sponsored events: sometimes your sponsor puts you in private capture the flag races.There are some pickups during the races. They give you some perks or simply ammunition, and they can change the flow of the game.Shortcuts are available, but they are not easy to drive through.3- CONCLUSIONI'm having a lot of fun with this game. I have to admit, the price is a bit steap, since it's marked 22,99€ in steam atm, but in a sale under 5€ is a must have for racing games fans.

												They don't really make games like this anymore. Car combat games, I mean. The best we got was the Twisted Metal Remake on the Playstation 3 in 2012, and that was after years of silence in that genre. Back on the Playstation 1, the best Twisted Metal competitor was undoubtedly Vigilante 8, and Gas Guzzlers reminds me of that game quite a bit, though it focuses more on actual racing than Twisted Metal or Vigilante 8 did.The game is also quite beautiful, with gorgeous lighting, cinematic motion blur, and highly detailed tracks. My issue with the game is the progression. The demo was great fun, because you had a pretty good car and a varied list of modes to play through, between arena deathmatch, combat racing, and even capture the flag. The progression in the full game is a lot more tedious; you have to work your way up buying new cars one by one, but you are locked out of the good cars until you reach a specific point in the game. It always felt like I had more than enough money for whatever I wanted at any given time and that the game was intentionally holding me back and restricting me to lame cars.You are also very slowly eased in to the game's more intense modes. Expect to spend a couple hours doing slow races, often without any weapons at all. Eventually you'll end up with a garage full of cars you'll probably never drive because they are objectively worse than stuff you get later on in the game.Despite this, I'd still recommend it. There's a great game in here, you just have to do some digging to get to it.			",443,83,23,36,20,4,52

												It's a spectacular 10+ hour game, with the option of having Duke Nukem as your announcer. The AI have the best AI names I've ever seen in a game, and the cars / weapons are pretty lit as well. The only problem is that the nuke only comes with four shots (That's using the last car fully upgraded) before needing to get an ammo pickup again, and there's really nothing to do after the campaign unless you have a friend who also owns the game. Otherwise, this game is sweet. Buy it when it's on sale because it's more of a $20 game than it is a $30.			",35,2,9,1,2,0,0

												I recommend this game however carefully. This game is also not split screen which is it's biggest down fall.I've read somewhere that this game could be comparable to an xbox 360 version of Mario Kart. Can such a comparison be made? Sort of. The game does deliver a fun arcade impact but instead of over stepping its boundaries and becoming limitless, Gaz Guzzlers Extreme simply plays it safe.As mentioned earlier, the fact that there is multiplayer is nice however there is NOT split screen (... seriously... get on the split screen thing for PC already people). The gameplay controls are what would one expect from a crash into everything type of game. The impact system is rewarding and when knocking out a player with a good nitro boost kamikaze, apparently you get more points. There are weapons that can be attached to the vehicles but this is where the game starts limiting itself. Playing career mode I've gone through four different types of weapons (one being a shotgun may I add and a second being a shot gun able to shoot forward and backwards). This is where it sort of sucks because I feel a lot more (maybe such as adding mortars etc...) could have been added. There are oil slicks as well as smoke clouds that are added into the game but serve more as defensive measures than offensive. This saved a bit of grace with the game giving it a little more to do. Career mode is fun and unlocking new cars slowly becomes rewarding. My favorite part to this game though is being able to choose different sort of races while moving on with your career. There are races where you can put weapons aside and make it a bump only race. This is a high light to this particular racing game, and sadly one of the only things to allow the player to step outside of the box. Career mode also offers players sort of side bonus races where the sponsor will have you play capture the flag. The variation in races is nice, and the tournament feature is a neat bonus. If you want to run the game at 64x... do it because changing graphics within the game sometimes leads to a crash. None the less my computer goes nuts when running this game but the graphics do look good. The car selection is decent and the weapon selection and effects could have been better. Sounds are as good as any vroom vroom sound. This game is cool and has it's moments, but I don't see much replayability in the future either than a game of multiplayer once in a blue moon. If it added split scren this game could have got a +1 easily, followed by another +1 for having a multitude of weapons. But falling short with an appropriate rating of : RATING : 7/10Gameplay B- Story / Campaign B- Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music B- Replay-ability C+ Overall  C+ScreenShots : What it looks like being shot atI absolutely love when games pay attention to detail. Nice to see the back of the carSmoke screen about to clear up. They are quite effective in this gameMoment of impact ",195,9,17,10,23,2,18

												All in, Gas Guzzlers Extreme is a nice surprise. While the campaign is a little slow, you’re still going to have fun with it. Multiplayer is where it’s at though, so long as it gets popular enough that you don’t end up in full AI lobbies. The sense of humor is good, it looks great, and the gameplay is so well tuned that at times you will forget you are playing a driving game altogether, and instead think you are playing a classic FPS game like Quake or UT.Read my full review here: http://calmdowntom.com/review/gas-guzzlers-extreme-pc/ ",71,11,4,8,42,1,22

												I'm not a massive fan of racing/driving games because I find them too easy, But gas guzzlers Extreme has manged to keep my interest by throwing guns into the mix. It's so satisfying to drift around a corner for nitro so you can catch up to that guy in 1st place then ram a missile up his exhaust! Enough game modes to play through.(Last Car Standing being my favorite) Only issue is the lack of people playing multiplayer you'd think for a game like this it would be higher.

												This game reminds me of Flatout a lot just with guns as improvement. It's kinda fun for a while, you can't play too much at once, just few races because its too repetitive. There are few types of races like with or without guns, knockout (every round the last one is destroyed) which seemed as the most entertaining for me and deathmatch or last man standing mode. From time to time there are sponsored events and championships. For every race you will get some money in order to improve your car or buy a new one. Possibilites of car improvements are very limited and there is a long way to unlock them, the only visible modifications on your car are paint, stickers and rims. Long story short the money in this game isn't an obstacle, it is just too repetitive and it takes just too long to unlock all the cars, improvements and tracks. Multiplayer is an another chapter. MP could be much more fun when you have someone to play with, because servers are deserted. 6/10			",320,92,7,54,60,4,68

												Great fun!  This is a totally underrated game.  I bought it on sale and it was worth it.  If you enjoyed ""Blur"" you may enjoy this.  Like Blur, this combines racing and old ""Spy Hunter"" style attacks on other cars, such as oil slicks, smoke screens, shooting with a variety of weapons.  The commentary is hilarious (I like Arny's voice).  You can change the settings on the appropriateness of language and driver names.  Default is ""adult"" names and language.  If kids are playing it, you can change it.  I've been using my Steam controller with the Xbox settings and it works fine.  You can change some, but it was easier just to leave it as it was.   It does not try to be a ""driving sim"" but is more arcade-style which makes it easily playable and lots of fun!  If you're looking for a very serious driving sim, this is not it.  This is a fun racer/shoot'em up game!  However, it does have a career mode like many racing games where you can buy many cars and upgrades, change the paint scheme, colors, rims, etc.  You earn money and open up new upgrades and race tracks.  There are different racing modes as well.   You can play solo races, campaign, and multiplayer.   This review turned out longer than I anticipated but there is quite a bit to this game as I think about it and the bottom line is that this is a very fun game and hopefully you will enjoy it too!

The graphics are pretty good its no Quantum Break but again for the price of the game its fantastic.

												Don't trust the preview videos... This isn't the no-holds vehicular combat game it's made out to be: it's a racer... and a bland one at that.There is no real choice of vehicles, since each new car is a straight upgrade to the former. There is no real choice between maneuverability and speed -or any other factor, for that matter, like armor or weaponry.Gas Guzzlers isn't a bad game, but it doesn't have enough to it tobe interesting past the first 15 minutes.

												For a long while I was looking for a combat racing game similar to ""Crash 'n' Burn"" or ""Jak X"", both on the PS2, and in a genre which is largely ignored and sees little interest from developers.One day by chance I saw ""Gas Guzzlers Extreme"" recommended to me during one of the sales, it looked like it might be fun so I bought it.While the premise may be extremely simple and repetitive - you gradually unlock new vehicles and weapons for these vehicles by racing in tournaments - it is probably the most fun I've ever had in a racing game for a very long time.It was exactly the crazy fun that I had been looking for, and has an absolutely amazing soundtrack to match!

												This game can be brutally challenging.  The AI can be vicious.  But that makes the rare victories taste all the more sweet if you don't rage-quit before they happen.  The graphics are beautiful and the silly celebrity-impersonated wheel operators are good for a smile or two each race.  If you can afford it I recommend the game for someone who can handle a challenge.I enjoy only two of the wheel operator voices; Arnie and Duke.  The other two are pretty generic.

												This game is GREAT. If you loved Flatout Ultimate Carnage you'll probably love this one too, expecially online with friends.MP is a blast with lots of different game modes, dedicated servers, voice and text chat, you can vote in lobbies, tons of weapons and much more stuff...It comes with VAC too, get it now! 8/10			",1227,269,43,98,80,11,119

												-""It's like FlatOut with guns.""Adam Kovic, MachinimaSeriously, though. Despite its age, it's a pretty solid arcade racer with gun combat. Lots of cars to choose from (they handle mostly the same) and the FlatOut comparison is not a flat out lie (AYO!). The very rules and handling physics bring said game to mind when you play and all veterans of the venerable series should feel like at home. The multiplayer is mostly dead but servers are alive and kicking, so players can join any time and if not, you can still race with bots, which is always a better alternative to an empty server.

												TL;DR this game is great.If you want more details, here's a full review.Concept - 10/10Good old arcade racing, with guns. There's no story, no ""racing crews"" competing to ""rule the streets"" or to ""get attention of a famous racer"", none of that stuff. Just pure arcade racing - win race, get credits, unlock more stuff, win more races with your new stuff, unlock newer stuff. In this day and age of everyone and their dog aiming for ""cinematic experiences"", this is a welcome breath of fresh air. Coupled with intentionally cheesy, schoolyard level humor (in a good way), various pop culture references, metal soundtrack and all the various little touches like the roadkill, this game just works very well and presents a great over-the-top dudebro arcade setting.Variety - 7/10There is a great variety of gameplay modes. There's classic race, ""power race"" (race with defensive powerups), there's race with weapons, there's knockout racing, destruction derby (with and without respawns), deathmatch (with and without respawns), capture the flag modes, zombie attacks... There's something for everyone.There's also a great variety of cars, but each new car is more or less better than the previous one. In other games, different cars may yield different advantages - for example, while a car may be slower, it may have better handling. Not so with cars in this game - every new car is strictly better than the previous one. Yes, they do have varying handling stats, but the arcade physics nullify any advantage you may gain by that, so you're pretty much forced to always pick the fastest car. And there aren't any other advantages other cars offer - they don't carry unusually heavy ammo loadout, or have a better shield... No. Nothing.The tracks are a plenty as well. There's beautiful Arizona tracks, there's various desert tracks, there are a couple of racing tracks, mountains, forests... And all of that in various weather conditions, from scorching sun to heavy snow. The environments are very detailed and look great. It's a pity there aren't any night races though.Graphics - 8/10While graphics surely aren't on the level of latest NFS, by no means they're poor - the picture is great, the tonemapping, FX and explosions all look good by today's standards. The graphics options screen is slightly confusing though as it has a number of advanced options that provide no explanation for what they do.Gameplay - 8/10I like that you can't change your weapon during a race, once you picked a weapon you're stuck with it. Makes for different playing styles. All the powerups that can be picked up are defensive - oil spills, mines, invisibility etc. You can't actually ""pick up"" a rocket or a gun (well, you can, in various domination/deathmatch modes, but i'm talking about racing). The game feels smooth and the progression is clear and predictable - slow and steady on lower tiers, complete high speed explosive chaos on final tracks.The great feature of the campaign progression is that, aside from championships, none of the tracks are actually mandatory to complete. There isn't a set of races you have to do to proceed to the next level - they are generated randomly every time. This makes it very easy and enjoyable to actually beat the campaign and unlock all cars. If you dislike shooting - you're welcome to only do power races. If you love knockout racing - you're welcome to do that, track after track. If you don't like racing at all and prefer deathmatches instead - no one is stopping you from doing those to progress through the campaign. If you only like racing in Arizona - you're welcome to pick those races when they're available, and ignore the rest. There are some caveats, of course, so you still have to do some events or tracks you might not like, but considering about 90% of the game you can do what you like, that's a good tradeoff.Multiplayer is where this game shines. It's sooooo much fun. I'm not too fond of deathmatches (although team deathmatches can become tense), but team racing was a brilliant idea. From my cursory exploration of GGE official servers, the game is pretty fluid online and netcode isn't glitchy. It's pretty solid and performant.There are slight issues with the gameplay, however. The biggest one being, there are no HUD indicators OR a map in various deathmatch/destruction derby modes. The game doesn't allow you to mouse look (only keyboard), so you essentially have no immediate awareness of your surroundings. More often than not i would be chasing a guy, then he suddenly makes a turn which i miss, and then he's gone and i have no idea where he went. Or sometimes i get shot at or hit out of nowhere. This issue makes deathmatches and capture-the-flags very frustrating. Amusingly, the zombie modes do have a radar, so why the developers thought it was a good idea to not use it in other modes is beyond me.There are other miscelaneous faults with the gameplay, such as, for example, not clear enough indication of my health level, and no clear indication of whether i am running out of ammunition, or already have and just don't know it. I lost count how many times i was carefully aiming into a guy, only to discover that i'm out of ammo and missed a finishing shot. After talking to the developer, i found out that it's all in the speedometer, but the fact that it took a comment from a developer for me to notice it, speaks for itself. I wish it was more clear.The AI is fairly competent, but not exceptional, and once you get a hang of how it drives (hint: it cuts, a lot), you can easily beat it even on hardest settings on a fast track. Now, slower tracks (i.e. winter ones) are a different animal, it seems like the AI there has superhuman grip over the road, and just about the only way to beat it is to grab all the nitro you can get, and shove their♥♥♥♥♥full of rockets for good measure. In other words, depending on the track, there can be huge disparity between difficulty of winning the race.Speaking of difficulty, various ""capture the flag"" events become pretty much impossible to win in single player on hardest levels, courtesy of combination of having no situational awareness whatsoever, and seemingly having complete morons on your team, who are doing absolutely stupid stuff like diving headfirst into an ongoing carnage while having the flag, or not protecting you when you have the flag. But, seeing as none of them are mandatory to complete, it's not a huge issue.Otherwise, it's got solid arcade gameplay, with arcade physics. The game clearly wants you to pay less attention to driving, and encourages shooting fun. This is best illustrated by Arizona tracks, where you can drive anywhere without any speed penalty whatsoever: you can wander off the tarmac pretty much all the time and still win the race. It's a shame there are a few annoying issues with the gameplay, otherwise i'd give it a 10. Overall score - 8.5/10So what's my summary? I'd give this game a 9/10 for what it offers, and 8/10 in the grand scheme of things. Aside from a few issues, it pretty much delivers what it sets out to achieve - it's a very well executed, fun arcade full of bad puns and cringeworthy humor. It doesn't quite have the replay value of ""Quake 3 with cars"", nor does it set any milestones in the gaming industry, but seeing how it never had any such aspirations, that's no big deal. Buy this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fun, fast, pretty, simple and full of awesome humour & references to over-the-top action entertainment glory days. Hell it even has duke's voice in it. Zombie dlc is also very much worth getting, its novelty fades fast but it's also unique and a blast the first few times.There are no major flaws but a few minor ones I might point out like: - I experience occasional crashes while browsing my garage or car shop but it's isolated to only then & there;- campaign mode progression can be a bit weird as you have to use certain cars at times and the game doesn't remind you of this- the female commentator voice is disappointing compared to the male one. Great arcade driving game that doesn't consume a lot of time. ",153,27,5,8,15,0,25

												The more mature Mario Kart for adults that you didn't know you needed. I tend to prefer racing games that lean simulation (gran turismo) as opposed to arcade (need for speed), but this is actually a very well put together game. Even the races that have no weapons are a lot of fun. The graphics are great for this kind of game, and it's running on ultra with no issues with only a GTX 1050 Ti and 3.6Ghz Quad-core even streaming to Steam Link (it must be well-programmed).Surprising quality and variety for what seems to be a small studio kind of game. A few minor issues have occurred that a reboot fixed, and it's not ultra-controller friendly, but I got the Steam controller mapped using keyboard controls.Also, blow-up dolls in the passenger seat, chickens, hula-hooping with tires, and Schwarzenegger (when he drinks too much) if you choose that voice setting. The effects during races, crashing, and shooting stuff is cool too. Oh, and the load times seem to be super short compared to a lot of AAA racing games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have played a handful of combat racers on the consoles. There is not very many of them on Steam that are very good. Believe me when I say this game is something special.I have played the Mario Kart games, I have played Jak X Combat Racing, I have played a bunch of others that don't really come to mind... I really love this genre. There is a handful of them on Steam, all mediocre or♥♥♥♥♥♥ usually one of the two. There is Post Apocalyptic Mayhem, which is actually okay, there is Zero Gear which is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥, and then there is that sonic game that's pretty damn good. This one, however, it is great. What makes it unique for its genre, other than not being complete horse♥♥♥♥♥♥AND being on Steam, is the healthy variety of modes. It has racing with or without weapons, it has the mode where last place explodes, there is even a deathmatch arena mode. The game will go through various modes, depending on the playlist, and it's pretty fun. Typically, you race and pick from the start what weapon you wish to use for the rest of the game. While most combat racers have random powerups that contains the weapons through out the race track, this one does not. There is a deathmatch mode where you do pick up weapons, as well probably others. There is A LOT of modes, I just find it strange there isn't one for racing with weapon powerups on the course. The weapons all feel fairly balanced. Some require different skill sets or are very circumstantial. They are pretty diversed, so you have plenty of toys you play with. There is also secondary weapons which are more for placing land mines, oil spills, etc. There is a decent variety of vehicles as well, which is great. You can also customize them a little bit, but you don't have a whole lot of control beyond the solid color they are and the different tires. There is dlc skins, but you cannot change the colors of them which I think is a missed opportunity. Speaking of DLC, this game has it. The DLC isn't half bad to be honest. I am typically anti-DLC because I'm both cheap and poor, but this game doesn't feel too bad. The dlc gives you a handful of stuff, like modes or vehicle skins. The modes are pretty fun, but you might have trouble finding a server that plays them all.Speaking of servers, this game has a good amount of them and, typically, they're all empty. This game is pretty dead or close to it. I go on and see maybe ten people at a time. This is definitely a game you want to get a group of friends to play. You'll come across full lobbies every now and again if you look for it at the right time, but ultimately you're not going to want to count on online with randoms.There is a handful of bugs that my friends have all experienced. Some minimal and then some critical game ruining experiences, like a friend getting stuck inside objects or outside of map. They happen fairly rarely, so I wouldn't take them too deeply into account in how good this game is.The graphics are pretty good, sound track is alright, and it has great controller support. The destruction on the vehicles is pretty good. In fact, you can even notice dints and torn off metal through out your vehicle. It even can lose the whole top, get smashed, etc. The customization is lacking however, as earlier mentioned.Not only do you have limitations on how you can edit your car, you also have limitations on how you edit your character. You have an avatar and the game has you choose a voice for him. The voices are pretty bad and get annoying over time. They're all basically impersonations of various popular characters, such as Arnold Shwartzenagger *spelled wrong, not gonna google* or Duke Nukem. There is another one, forgot what it was. The strange part is, how often they talk and how annoying they are, the other players never at any point hears your character. Why have them at all!?This game was a positive experience and therefore a great buy in my book. My friends and I played it boat loads of times and we will probably play it quite often for a long time, even if we take breaks from it from time to time. I encourage everyone to purchase this game if you're interested in combat racers and have been looking for a good one. The DLC isn't bad either. Fair warning, though... Make sure you run it for 64 bit if you got 64 bit OS. 8/10Pros-Great gameplayGood game modes choices.Decent variety of vehicles, weapons, and the likes.Cons-Avatar and vehicle customization is incredibly limited, other players do not hear voices, etc.Bugs and the likes. They are there and you will notice them.Dead online community *shocker*			",648,117,18,55,55,7,71

Lots of agressive, competitive and fun racing...but with GUNS!!Plenty of car/track/weapons variation to keep you amused and coming back for more.Great graphics at this price point and driving physics refined enough to let you feel in control of your chosen vehicle.Also comes with DLC that adds a bit more to an already decent game. If you like the thought of bashing zombies with your car and/or firing some mean weaponry at them this will satisfy.Hope there is a sequel			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Car combat titles have always been my favorite. Carmageddon to Vigilante 8, or Twisted Metal to Full Auto 2 this game earns its place as a strong, action packed vehicular combat video game with a lot of personality, but with surprisingly little storyline. However, don't go in expecting the controls that Twisted Metal would have, this game seems to ditch arcade-like physics for a more realistic approach.

												I'm about 7 hours into Gas Guzzlers Extreme as I right this. As a lover of Rogue Trip on PS1 I have been hunting for a game like this for some time. I went through a couple indie games before I got to this one and it's exactly what I was looking for: Cars with guns.The career mode reminds me of Need For Speed Underground 2 in many ways... but with guns. It does take some getting used tot and the default key bindings are rubbish, however once you're up and going and shooting and racing it's a really great game. I love that is has a plethora of ahievments to unlock that actually feel meaningful to get (similar to Counter Strike: Global Offensive). The graphics really are top notch. If you don't have the specs to play this game at max settings you're really missing out on some great stuff.It's challenging and rewarding as a PvP race game. I don't like the Power Race mode (cars WITHOUT guns, boring eh?) and I'm not a massive fan of the Deathmatch/Last Man Standing/Capture The Flag modes either. They are fun to play around in but the lack of a minimap of any description is just killer, it's like playing a FPS game without a radar. It's fun, but it's not as fun as the races.Haven't done a lot of multiplayer just because there aren't really many people playing it as far as I can tell. One thing I like aobut the career mode is that you progress, you upgrade and unlock, you have to think about where and when to spend your money (not that there's a real shortage of it), and that isn't present in multiplayer. All cars are the same and all upgrades are unlocked, which is fun in a sandbox mode kind of way but it is much more satisfying to have earned those things yourself.Would love if I knew some more people playing the game because I think there's a lot of great things to explore and experiment with. No regrets buying the game at all and will certainly continue to play it.			",26,1,1,4,2,0,3

												Lovely graphics, great sounds, fantastic car handling, great weapons / power-ups, superb tracks and all delivered with a pitch black sense of wonderfully macabre humour (just look at the in game racing name rosta and you'll understand - ****ing hilarious).Essentially at it's heart is a superb racing game with the addition of inventive, well balanced weaponry. I'll never understand why this game wasn't a MASSIVE hit with PC gamers but it's not too late to rectify that and turn this into a sleeper cult classic. I can't recommend this gem enough. It's daftly cheap now (the addons are amazing by the way) so if you like the genre and haven't already taken the plunge then simply stop reading this and buy it forthwith.It's in my top three all time racing destruction games and trust me I've played or owned them all across multitues of platforms since the dawn of gaming time.So, in summary.On a very drunken and experimental night in Soho. Carmageddon, met Twisted Metal, met Destruction Derby, met Super Mario Cart, met Colin Mcrae, met Interstate '76 who had a keys in the bowl party together and begat a weird, disturbed, yet somehow beautiful emo kid who likes to set fire to things and chuckle loudly about it afterwards... can't say a fairer description of this gem than that :)I hope they make a sequel.9/10 - A must buy.

												This combat race car game is fun! And funny, too, with its redneck-dystopian humor. This is the Car Wars (a.k.a. Autoduel) video game I've been looking for, all these years. Okay, so it's not turn-based and tactical as is the Car Wars board game, and there aren't nearly as many options when building/upgrading your cars. But it's close enough to the look and feel of Car Wars. Much closer than I found Twisted Metal to be.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I thourght I give this game a try after watching TotalBiscuit's WTF video of it as well as a review or two and it's one of those games you glad you did pick up.This game first greets you with tongue-in-cheek humour, like having the option of having (a unofficial) Duke Nukem make quirky qoutes whenever you pick up a power-up or destroy a opponent, as well as the descriptions for vehicle upgrades and even small things like a blow-up doll and a marvel head statue packed in the back of a roliant robin look-alike.The vehicles handle as people said they do, they feel weghty, arcadey but not enough where you can make 90-degree turns at top speed, you do have to brake and you satisfyingly drift around courners which doesn't slow the pace of the race, races are constantly speedy and constatnly action packed, you can be shot at from behind and in front as some of the guns are able to shoot forward and backward.This game has great feel, good humour and it's quite pretty as well, in summary this feels like Vigilante 8 mixed with Mario Kart along with the car based destruction of Flatout.This is a exellent arcady racer and I recomend it.

												It's a decent racer/vehicle combat game with a (slightly juvenile) sense of humour and a slightly obscure progression system (I just keep racing and get money - that's all I understand)Some of the Deathmatch/CTF open-world stuff isn't really my cuppa (tho it works just fine) but the racing is quite well done - the weapons are 'fair' - whoever designed the cars had an appreciation of cars too!No other game has included a Hillman Hunter - the car which went on to be the first 'Iranian National Car' (the Neykan)Note: the 2nd Iranian National Car - the Peugeot 405 aka Peykan - is sadly missing - DLC perhaps? :)My ONLY complaint jere is it's a massive install (16Gb) and it has some whopping loadtimes (not noticably reduced on an SSD so uncompressed data I guess?) but if you can live with that, it's fully worth the relatively small sum I paid (Steam Sales eh?) :)			",606,162,56,93,89,4,107

												UPDATE:  The game ended up not being compatible with the latest Nvidia drivers for my 760M.  Installing older drivers did the trick.  Of note, the devs were not able to figure this out, and I ended up solving the problem through 5 days off and on of trying to diagnose the problem myself.Now that I can play, the game is very enjoyable and I'd recommend it.---------------------------------The game looks amazing and everything I'm looking for in a racing/combat genre.HOWEVER:  I've been trying to work through multiple channels to include the devs directly for almost a week now and the game will not even work on my high-end laptop...The suspected problem is extremely poor coding for mobile dedicated graphics cards, I would love to give this game a better review, but it would be nice to ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO PLAY IT.

												Awesome game if you love arcade style car combat. Kind of a Vigilante 8 and Burnout meet Dirt Showdown. Looks great and plays solid.Good assortment of game modes and thankfully a decent enough to work singleplayer campaign.From standard racing to full blown vehicular CTF warfare.I only have 2 problems with it.It locks up my desktop when I exit it forcing me to sign out of my windows account and back in as the Game screen sits frozen on top of everything including taskmanager.And secondly every time I go to play online there is nobody playing forcing me to play against AI.Honestly quite surprised this game doesn't have loads more playing it. Definitely has a AAA polish to it.If they could get more people playing online this game could easily consume hours of my life.Time for some PR work from the devs me thinks. This game could easily become a name franchise like Flatout and Burnout.Only thing I'd add to the game is having some kind of progression and levelling unlocks so you could upgrade and buy vehicles like in the offline career mode instead of having everything available from the get go.But yes, if you like shooting cars with cars while racing in realistic looking environments then this game is definitely worth checking out especially if it's on sale.

												I played this game for 4.6 hours straight and I was just amazed with the gameplay and with the graphics so I wanted to write a quick review while it's on sale.The physics in this game are amazing. Turning left and right is really realistic and it may be hard to drive for the first few races but once you get the hang of it you will be a real guzzler maniac! Maps are briliantly made, I was stunned by the enviroment while I was driving and how every road feels different. On dirt it's really hard to steer and break but on concrete it's the opposite and you can go really fast while still having control over your vehicle. There are a lot of game modes which remind me of FPS games like ""Capture The Flag"" and ""Team Deathmatch"" and they are really fun because the weapons in this game are f*cking awesome! Once you destroy a car it blows into 5 million pieces and every piece is very detailed (they even look amazing on low settings that I play on)This was written in 6am while I was struggling to keep my eyes open, I will most likely update it every once in a while since I really enjoy the game and it was developed by people from my country which makes me even more interested in it because gaming and video games in general aren't really popular in Croatia so I want to see how popular it will get.

												Games like this are rare these days , specially on PC. It's a car battle racing game, like Post Apocalyptic Mayhem or Mario Cart (but more brutal).  You can customise and upgrade your cars in some ways, like choosing which weapons you use and have quite a number of cars to choose from . Also battle damage depicted greatly on your car if it gets damaged. Handling is ok i guess, but personaly i feel like driving a boat with a xbox 360 controler.			",203,25,11,28,14,4,25

												You loved Flatout 1 and 2. You loved Carmageddon. You always liked the concept of cars with weapons. Put that in a blender and you get this brillant game, Gas Guzzlers Extreme. First of all, holy crap what a lot of game modes and possibilities in one rather unknown game. Customizable cars (even in multiplayer!), a hell lot of tracks and maps and go on. Now the game can have this all and fail. But it does not. This is action filled racing and killing. The controls are really arcade; most like you should expect of such a game. It still is hard to get proper control; you have to defend yourself against other drivers, while attacking them and still racing.Now what does your car have beside well... being a car? You'll be fitted with two sorts of weapons. First of all, one type of gun will be fitted on the car. You may choose it depending on the game mode, and you can't change this in the race. You can only pick up extra ammo for it. Second there are special weapons you can pick up during the race, a bit like in Blur. Think in mines, spilling oil, smoke and extra boost. Talking about boost; your car has it. It is earned through various ways, as in these pick ups, and well not driving so clean; hitting other cars, powerslides, destroying stuff that is in your way and more.The graphics are just good. Nothing extraordinary, but neither is it ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Same for the AI. The game itself is one of the most perfect racing multiplayer games in its sorts. It really is one of the most fun games to play along with others. A bit like Mario Kart really; the misery of others is what makes it fun. So, without a doubt recommended.			",87,3,7,6,16,0,2

												Well, The best way to put it is 'Flatout, but with guns instead of the windshield cannon thing'.The gameplay is fun, and you have the option of racing with or without guns, or playing a small number of arena modes. Getting a kill in a race is incredibly satisfying, mostly because when someone dies in a race they are COMPLETELY out of the race. If you can ram them hard enough, you can even kill opponents in races that don't have guns, and there's even an achievement for it. Sadly, the weapon classes are limited to shotguns, miniguns, and rocket launchers. The good news is that there is some good variety within each weapon class. There's plenty of vehicles available, including a Reliant Robin and a DeLorean, and all vehicles can be upgraded (however, some vehicles can be upgraded further than others). The vehicles seem to just scale though, and it's more a case of 'what's better' instead of 'what would work best for me', which is a bit dissapointing. You can also choose from 4 sets of voiceovers for your driver, 3 of which that are silly, and 1 that is just Duke Nukem (possibly unlicensed, but I don't care). The sponsor system is cool; you can only have one sponsor at once, you only get bonus money from your sponsor if you have the sponsor's decal equipped, and sponsors might abandon you if your performance gets sloppy. Sponsors will also invite you to special sponsor team events where you are given a car and a weapon, and you are put on a team led by your sponsor with the objective of defeating a team led by a rival sponsor, with a sizable cash payout if your team wins. Standard career events are randomly generated based on what tracks and gamemodes you have unlocked, with optional secondary objectives that offer bonus cash if you complete them. The game's humor is good, and it's crude, but not completely tasteless, with subtle refrences in all sorts of places.This game made me realise that Full Auto 2 would have been more than just mediocre if it was more like Flatout 2.It's a good thing FA2 and FO2 got drunk at a party and woke up next to each other without pants.

												So far, it's got everything you could want in a car combat game. It even sidesteps the main problem with car combat games (racers with guns hanging back to shoot at racers ahead of them) by having multiple game modes, including an arena combat mode (""Sponsored Match""). My only outstanding complaint is that the steering is very arcadey, so miniscule adjustments aren't really possible.			",183,34,7,13,14,3,7

												oh this is just SOOOOOOOOOOOOOo much FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN!!!come on!! great looking cars, weapons, and some very , VERY vindictive opponents!!!the game evolves in a good rate, it is fairly easy to advance (even in above medium difficulty) and win races (with a few restarts on the way, because in the 2nd to last turn, of the last lap, you get a missile in the a** or find a mine on the road, or whatever) and earn money for new cars, upgrades and weapons.The game modes are a lot, and quite diversified (deatchmatch and dominator are just awesome), the tracks also (race and deathmatch like Junkyard and Port), the opponents are quite smart...... really mean (FUNNN)... and with such funny names.took me about 24h to finish the game in hard (if I remeber correctly)... has a lot of races, you can spend additional time earning money before advancing.... (I did that a bit, finsihed with 0.5Million).When you get one of the top 2 cars with full upgrades, you just have a great speed advantage. Again: FUN, FUn, FUn, FUN!! Pushes your hardware a little bit too much IMHO and uses 16GB of disk. But, really worth it!!! REALLY!!! SO MUCH FUN!!8.5/10 (for the ""DIE B*TCH"" feeling you get during the races :D)			",16,1,6,0,10,0,4

												Fast paced and exciting car action game that is simply great chaotic fun with plenty of replay value. Both races and battles are thrilling and the game is easy to learn, but hard to master. Grinding the various events to unlock new cars, weapons, stickers, engines, and even sponsors can get incredibly addicting really fast. There have been times where I didn't intend to play more than a couple of races before moving onto something else, but ended up quadrupling that number as the unlocks kept rolling in. But even in defeat, the game stays satisfying and you can earn plenty of money losing as long as you complete the bonus objectives; vice versa if you ignore the bonus objectives and simply win the events. The music is mostly hard rock, which fits well with the action. None of the tunes are very memorable, but they get the job done. You can choose a voice for your character. For mine, I choose an Arnold Schwarzenegger type voice, and he actually says lines from Arnold's actual films, specifically Jingle All the Way (one of my favorites), which gets quoted the most. It gets a bit repetitive hearing the same phrases repeated over and over again, but at first, it was amusing and elicited quite a few chuckles from me. Seeing how much stuff there is to unlock can be overwhelming to the player at first, especially when they first boot it up, but once you really get into the game, it'll seem too easy. The only thing that would make the game feel more complete is having a better multiplayer community. That way, people would have more of an incentive to buy the cool looking dlc. Nearly ever time I went on, there were only a couple of lobbies, both with very few players. However, whenever I did play an online game, I had an absolute blast; it brought back memories of playing Twisted Metal with friends, and the action was even more insane than the highest difficulty of the single player. Overall, this is easily one of best racing games on steam, especially on the non-sim side. I highly recommend it if you enjoyed the Twisted Metal series growing up, or even if you never got to try it, as it's a very entertaining game that respects the player's time.			",175,31,3,17,7,0,8

												This game is totally awesome I bought it a couple days ago and can't put it down. In the campaign mode you compete in death races and demolition derbies to earn cash to customize your cars and buy new weapons and upgrades. There's also a heavy metal soundtrack and a DLC pack where you mow down hordes of zombies. It looks nice and you can play it with a controller to make it more comfortable. If you like fast cars, loud guitars, smashing things, shooting things, or running over things you should totally buy this.			",18,0,0,4,0,0,0

												Great game that is a lot of fun that is similar to a very old game called Deathtrack that I used to love and similar ideas to the more recent movies of the same name. Been waiting a long time for a game that lives up to Deathtrack and this game does it with far better graphics. Mario Kart is similar in some ways but does not allow you to buy better cars and upgrade them with better parts and weapons like this game does. Game has rewards for taking out other players, mines and smoke screens on top of the shoot em up side to keep the race challenging. Only major complaint is capture the flag is not obvious where you are meant to go once you have the flag, hopefully an update makes it clearer. Game loads very quick and runs on my old GTS260 GPU so the engine is well written. Love how quick it is to get back racing again if you are killed. Used the free demo for less than an hour before I wanted the game. In campaign mode the weapons, new trakcs, upgrades and cars are unlocked if you place in the top 3 of a race.... Buy the game as shoot em up car racing games are not very common and it would be great to see more titles in this Genre. Best game of its type in a very very long time.			",8,6,0,0,0,0,0

""THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE!"" - The Demoman from Team Fortress 2.one of the most addicting games i've ever played, it's mad fun just to shoot people with many different weapons and the powerups make things interesting, and when all else fails, just use your car as a battering ram. then when your tired of all that, just do powerup races, which forces you to leave your weapons back at the shop and use just your car and powerups to destroy the competition.there's also a healthy amount of cars (and 3 extra with both DLC) the customization is a bit bare bones, but still nice anyways and the humour is ...uniqueyou can also set your characters voice to DUKE OR THE TERMINATOR! (and also an angry scottish fellow.)personally, i think $25 is a slight bit too far up the hill. so instead i highly recommend picking this up when it's on sale.			",55,9,14,1,2,1,0

												This is probably the most fun racing game I've played yet.   It has replaced Grand Tourismo 3 A-spec as my favorite racing game, and that was a game that I got 100% gold on all races and tests.    The controls of GGE are sublime.  At first a seasoned racer might think the controls are a little simple, and that the simulation is not realistic, but this completely falls by the wayside as the game increases in complexity and speed.   When you start getting the faster cars, and onto the harder tracks, the game assumes an incredible speed, and you begin to be amazed and start thinking things like ""did I really just pull that off?!""   All in all, this game sets the standard for a Car Wars road racing video game.   There is no other game better.  The game also as an incredible amount of songs.  The game is light hearted and all the cars, upgrades, race tracks and gameplay are whacky jokes.   For example a M3 BMW is a ""Bummer 3M""  And a Shelby GT500 is a ""Lord Shaggy 500 JT""    Recently I've tried some other racing games, and frankly the ""learning curve"" on the controls has been tedious and annoying.   I put that in quotes because I know how to drive a car fast, and I've been playing racing games for a long long time.  A game should be good enough that you're not fighting against the controls.   GGE delivers, the controls are sublime.			",46,14,0,16,6,0,6

												This game is a true hidden gem. Take games from the past like Road Rash & Twisted Metal and even Mario Kart with machine guns! Then take heavy metal music and mix them all together and you get Gas Guzzlers Extreme. The graphics are pretty good, but the chaos and action make this game all worth the while. I use my Logitech G27 wheel and it works great with the game. There is a good amount of customization for your cars kind of similar to the Grid Series. I played the demo of this game and after a couple races i purchased it.The only set back right now is not a lot of people playing it online yet, I think this will change thou!If you enjoy chaos, destruction, and high speeds you will love this game!!!

												I usually hate racing stuff, as I find it boring. It's surprising how my view on this changes when you add guns and utter destruction.Oh, this game. I found it in some weird bundle and tried it with little to zero interest... man was I wrong. Gameplay-wise, GGE is a fast paced racing-shooter-multievent game. You  take part in tournaments where you need to complete races in various modes (ranging from ""normal"" race to arena/CTF), earning money and unlocking cars, upgrades and new game modes in the process.I love a lot of things about this game, from the general ""I don't fing care"" humorous kind of style to the music. Some texts/voices are hilarious, as are the first cars you race with. Graphics are also quite good and I like a lot how damage is dinamically represented on the cars.It gets a bit repetitive after a while, but it's good for a half an hour of brainless distraction (and destruction) once in a while. It also has  multiplayer but I haven't tried it yet, although I fear the servers are a bit empty because this game is unluckily not as known as it should.I don't know if it's worth getting at full price (here it is €23+5 for the DLC) but if it is on sale buy it without hesitation!

Play with us here: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/GGExtreme_MP_GroupI'd love more nuanced handling, better damage models and more server options - but in the meantime this will do nicely.

												A fun and over the top combat racing game with frantic gameplay, pervasive humour and a good amount of content.PROS:-pretty good graphics with decent effects and tons of explosions whenever combat starts: cars also show damage and deform appropriately when hit-a good rock soundtrack that perfectly complements the action-you can choose a Duke Nukem voice for your pilot-easy to pick up gameplay provides immediate fun-well made career progression sees you slowly advance to higher tournament levels-several different game modes to choose from like normal races, battle races (where you can use weapons), deatmatch, capture the flag etc-overall great track design-lots of cars, upgrades, weapons and tracks to unlock as you win-race pickups (like shield, mines, smoke) add even more means to annoy and damage your opponents-a good amount of customization to each car thanks to rims, stickers and ability to change paint colour-the pervasive humour is pretty funny overall whether it's pilot names, upgrades descriptions or ingame messages CONS:-AI rubberbanding during races can get a bit annoying-a couple tracks are less inspired than others-multiplayer is sadly empty


Gas Guzzlers Extreme 
A Screenshot of Gas Guzzlers Extreme
By: stranger1982




Gas Guzzlers eschews a story in favour of immediate, silly and ultimately enjoyable gameplay that basically sees you laying waste to the opposition with whichever weapon you prefer while trying to overtake those who survive: it's simple, it doesn't take itself seriously but it works, and it works well.Considering the combat racing game genre is pretty rare on Steam Gas Guzzlers is a truly welcome addition: while not overly original it has enough going for it to merit a full recommendation by me, especially considering you can get the whole package for 4$ durring sales.

												This game reminds me a lot of the old Ratbag DIRT TRACK RACING series of driving simulations, at least in terms of improving your vehicle and as well the general feel of the car handling.  The automobiles come in tiers and I've just started the second tier of vehicles, so I anticipate faster, better handling vehices as a I advance.The addition of weapons and power-ups really add a lot of interest to the game.  Cars can simply be knocked off the road by ramming or firepower, or you can spend a bit of time and destroy an opponent.  It is a bit of trade off as you might sacrifice too much of your position in the race to win it if you spend too much time fragging the slower vehicles.It is a fun game and still being developed (DLC released today)			",201,55,7,54,22,5,94

												Great game.Easiest way to describe this game is - Burnout Paradise + Twisted Metal + Flatout.It's a racing game with guns attached to your car. And as you get farther along, you will unlock new cars as well as weapons and upgrades. There are several modes you play to progress through the career. • Weapon Race - Just as it sounds, a race with weapons. There is two options, -finish the race by outrunning the competition, or -eliminate the competition and be the last to only finish the race.• Knock-Out - An eliminator type race. Whoever is in last place will get eliminated when every other racer in front passes the starting line to the next lap. Same options apply, you finish the race by outrunning the competition, or you can simply lay waste to them and win.• Power Racing - A standard race, no weapons allowed. Although you can still destroy racers by ramming into them or using mines and various power ups you pick up.Later on in the game, when you get access to the high-end cars, (i.e. - Dodge Viper, Lamborghini Aventador rip offs) you get access to -• Deathmatch - Kill anything that moves There's more, but I'll let you find out the rest yourself! After all, this game deserves all the love.I found this game to be a hidden gem. If you liked Burnout Paradise, you'll love this game.			",248,28,6,31,13,1,15

												This is  a great addition to the combat race genre.Gas Guzzlers Extreme does a great job of providing a HUGE assortment of cars, weapons, power-ups and beautifully detailed tracks with extra features like passing airplanes and plenty of critters to score roadkill points on.  Visibility is generally good on the tracks, and the weapons are generally well balanced between damage potential and range / reload / projectile speed.  Races are short enough where trying to eliminate the competition will generally result in failing to catch up to the lead racer in time to eliminate or beat him to the finish line.  So, you need to choose your priorities and when / how long to be offensive and when to just stay in the lead!Finally, there is a lot of humor to this game.  The racing avatar looks very much like Top Gear's ""Stig"", and he'll be doing funny things in the garage while you're customizing your car.  (Unfortunately, while you can change the color of his outfit, you cannot choose a female driver / avatar.) There are also funny voices to make your driver say funny things when he takes damage, etc., but he'll still say ""S#1t!"" when the explicit language is turned off.  (Parents, take note of this!)  For more sensitive ears, I recommend turning the voice off.FWIW, I've enjoyed the likes of the original ""Death Track"", ""Road Wars"" due to their playability and variety of vehicles and tracks.  (I did NOT, however, enjoy ""Death Track: Resurrection"", as its tracks were too cluttered and low-visibility.)  If you enjoy a race with the added excitement of a little firepower, I recommend Gas Guzzlers Extreme.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Literally the best car combat game I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. The Graphics are absolutely stop notch, the weapons, cars and tracks are many and varied, the AI is fun and sometimes brutal, and the game is just utter brilliance that blows many car combat games out of the water.

												Gas Guzzlers Extreme is a fast and furious game with a hint of twisted metal, a sprinkle of Burnout: Paradise and Need for Speed all mixed together. But oh no! Professor Gamespires has accidentally added a special ingredient! Guns! With tons of trigger-happy AI just chomping at the bits to bite your metal♥♥♥♥♥♥a new one, dozens of tracks to choose from and dozens of customization options for your car, only you can save the day from…um…nothing!That’s right! In Gas Guzzlers Extreme, you play as a random character who’ll go through a series of difficult, heart wrenching, ah who are we kidding?The game’s actual story is that you start off with a horrible car and race until you have an amazing car. You start by choosing a character with series of voices ranging from nothing to annoying including the option of a Duke Nukem voice. From there, you race in a series of game modes reminiscent of the PS1 style Twisted Metal games in hopes to gain money and prizes. After each successful win, the player will be rewarded with a possible variety of things including money, unlocked cars, car parts, new tracks, weapons and more! From there, you can either buy a new car, upgrade your current car with parts or aesthetics like paint colors, or continue racing if you don’t have enough money for what you want. If you’re really strapped on cash, you can always sell an old car in your garage once you’re done with it for half price. We thought this was nice since you really have no use for older cars once you unlock a better one and purchase it.As for the game modes, you have a fairly okay (if a bit lackluster) variety. You have racing, racing with weapons, elimination with weapons, deathmatch with weapons, and last man standing with weapons. Some of these you unlock as you go along in the campaign, while others are there from the start. During the campaign, you’re not forced (besides playing tournaments) to any one game mode, meaning you can play any one particular game mode you like as much as you want. All the game modes play well and can be challenging against the AI, but the personality really just doesn’t seem to be there as one would hope for a game carrying a $25 price tag.The cars also don’t have a lot of personality and they’re all rather bland. The game takes a lot of influence from Burnout Paradise, but unfortunately it also took it’s generic cars and maps. The maps again well not inherently bad just don’t carry the memorability that something in the Twisted Metal games might. However they all play well when racing on the tracks. Some of the tracks with weather effects show off what the engine they’re using can pull off.Luckily what the game lacks in true originality is made up for in it’s actual gameplay. While it did take some of the lesser aspects of Burnout: Paradise, it also took the fairly well done vehicle racing by tweaking the cars to make them feel slightly heavier and adding weapons. The racing, combat and overall gameplay while we do have minor complains like the wish for a difficulty meter, meant the gameplay was solid and the racing fun and challenging. With a fairly large variety of weapons, it really comes down to personal preference. While some weapons are clearly better than others, there are also certain cases where you need to pick your strategy carefully as to what weapons to use on which map as larger maps aren’t really the best choice to play with a shotgun-type weapon.The main section of the game should take anywhere between 8-12 hours. It’s a little grindy in the beginning, but the ability to unlock cars and customization parts helps to remove that factor in later hours of the game.You also have a variety of power ups you can find on the map ranging from speed boosts to double damage using your weapon of choice. Along with that, you can also find traps like mines or oil slicks. While somewhat helpful in the racing modes, it’s far more useful in deathmatch and last man standing where you have a far more open space to try and lure enemies into mines and what not.But clearly, some of you didn’t come here to ask us about the heart-wrenching story, you just want to know if big things go boom, and if the booms are impressive. Unfortunately big things don’t normally go boom. However, car explosions and the overall effects are really well done. So while big things don’t go boom, the things that do boom, boom quite nicely. You can even run into certain hazards on the track and gain a certain percentage of boost.If you ignore the campaign or indeed all the single player modes and you’re planning on playing the fun Twisted Metal style combat in multiplayer or with friends, forget about it! The multiplayer is more dead than a bad pun about door knobs. The multiplayer does have a whole series of dedicated servers, but it’s all for not without players on them. Unfortunate, because the game would benefit from having an online playerbase.Visually, the game looks similarly to Burnout Paradise. It’s not visually incredible, but it’s not horrible either and the visuals get the job done. The variety of levels and customization help to break up the aesthetics.The audio also isn’t bad. The music is metal cheese if that’s your thing, and the voice acting for the selection of voice characters is cheesy, but they get the job done. Some of their lines however repeat just a bit too often. The audio effects however are well done and help to make the crashes feel more realistic.As for the controls, there is no automatic controller support. If you hook up a controller, prepare to do all the button mapping yourself. That being said, full remapable keys are welcome, and the settings while on the generic side were fine, though no FOV slider was present unless we missed it. The game ran quite well, never dipping below 60fps on our system even with Vsync off, with very little if any screen tearing or micro stuttering present. The only real issue we had was that at two separate points, the gun we had equipped wouldn’t stop firing, causing us to run out of ammo.Overall, the game was (while unremarkable in terms of uniqueness) offered well-balanced and fairly competent combative racing. Twisted Metal-like games don’t come onto PC often, and the amount of more ‘arcade’ style racers on PC is slim at best, but this game certainly is one to add to the wishlist if you’re a fan of the vehicle driving of Burnout or wished to have vehicular combat like in Twisted Metal. It’s cheesy audio may turn off some and it’s visuals are nothing to write home about, but it was enjoyable to play it’s single player. Some notable things that would have improved the experience is if it offered more characterization of cars and if it had a story more in line with the 4th Twisted Metal game. It’s debatable if it’s worth the $25 and we’d suggest picking it up on sale if you plan to pick up the game. For what it is, we enjoyed our time with the game and would like to see a possible sequel or spin-off. PROS  Excellent overall driving and arcade combat Well-balanced combat Controls were well done Great selection of tracks, and car customization Fairly decent selection of game modes MEH  Music and voice acting are just okay A difficulty meter would be beneficial Visuals get the job done, just nothing to write home about CONS  It loses something without a multiplayer playerbase Steep MSRP may leave some waiting for a sale ",489,193,38,53,37,2,44

												Rating: 6.5/10Fun combat racer! There is plenty of content copy pasted from the previous game (Gas Guzzlers: Combat Carnage), but the improvements and content additions are quite significant, though not worthy enough to make a new game. But however if you wish to purchase this, do expect a lot of fun from it, more than any other available combat racing game! There are, however quite a few shortcomings which can be looked over considering the fact that this is an Indie game. Out of the shortcomings, you'd first notice the dated visuals and a lack of content since there isn't much variety in the laps, and they can get confusing at times because the path is not always distinctive and kind of ""merges in"" with the surroundings, causing car crashes in the first few attempts. The game has an acceptable number of cars, which are of course unlicensed but that doesn't really matter since this is not an AAA game. The extra game modes like Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Last Man Standing, etc can be fun, but I personally didn't really enjoy them due to the aforementioned lap design problem.

												Okay, so initially: I had issues with the frames per second being ridiculously low, which according to the game dev, was what was causing the AI to do constant donuts on the road, and for me to only be able to do 90 degree and 180 degree turns.After speaking with the game dev, and working out the issue, things are running a good deal smoother.  Had to lower the graphics quality even further (which it had been on Medium preset before, now its on Low preset) and set the resolution from 1280x720 to 1024x768.  Thus I give the customer service an A+.I ran through one race after these changes were made, the AI actually appeared to be a bit more competent; they are actually trying to complete laps now.  I still wound up passing them by, but thats not a bad thing; means the AI is not built for rubber band physics, which in turn means the game is fair.So would I recommend this game? Yes, I'd probably give it around a 7 or 7.5 out of 10.  Where as before I would of probably given it a 5 or 5.5 when it was bugging out.So give it a shot, its a decent racing game.If you have any issues with the AI and controls, try fiddling with the graphics and resolution settings a bit.

Either way this game does a great job at bringing back the old school vibe of guns mounted are cars combined with a racing simulator vibe by letting you earn money and upgrade/customize cars you buy. I would say it did a great job and those who love the idea will love the game. They did totally drop the ball in terms of not including local split screen though.			",647,319,15,99,47,6,79

												Rating 9/10Overview: Arcade Racer Similar Games: Mario Kart, Sonic All star racing The Good:+ Campaign mode is what you normally expect from an arcade racer. You race in different events to collect money to buy/upgrade cars. As you move up the rankings you can compete in a tournament. After successfully completing the tournament you can move up to a higher tier with faster cars. + Lots of different game modes, classic , deathmatch, capture the flag etc. Each one is fun to play and offers something unique. + Tons of weapons in 4 categories: Machineguns, shotguns, rocket launcher and grenade launchers. Each weapon has its own strengths and weaknesses + Lots of well designed race tracks and arenas + lots of options to customize each race. Two options stand out for me; Arcade mode means your car does not loose traction depending on what surface it's on, and rubberbanding can be adjusted in the multiplayer for AI bots you can race against.   + Dedicated servers so you can play multiplayer against bots and thus earn some of the multiplayer achievements+ developers have supported this game long after release and continue to be active on the forums. + The DLC zombie mode is a fun, frantic horde mode against zombies. The Average:The soundtrack is not memorable but it does get the job done. There are still some people playing on the servers but it would be nice to see a lot more. Conclusion:This is a fantastic arcade racer that should be played by more people. The developers have done an amazing job with this game. I considered this a 'hidden gem' within the Steam catalogue. If you love arcade racers, check this game out. ",731,344,32,73,63,8,96

												I love this game. Gas Guzzlers Extreme is an arcade combat racing game. If you enjoy these types of games--everything from Blur to Wipeout--then give this game a try (there's a free demo). This is about as good as this genre gets.Pros: Weapons: There are a variety of weapons to choose from and most have a tremendous feeling of heft/firepower. Explosions: When you blow up an opponent, the resulting explosion is extremely satisfying. Tracks: A nice variety of tracks that feature plenty of shortcuts and alternate routes. Difficulty: There are several difficulty levels. The game can be as easy or hardcore as you want it. Demo available: The demo is great for trying out the gameplay and playing with the graphics settings to make sure the game runs well on your system.Cons:Humor: It's a mixed bag. It's a bit on the immature/borderline offensive side of things. Some of it was funny, but it sometimes crossed the line of good taste (IMO). Thankfully, you can turn off the voiceovers, which is the primary source of the questionable humor.The one thing I won't comment on is the graphics. That's because my system actually comes up a little short of the minimum specs. While the game is technically playable on ""medium"" graphics on my system, I prefer to play it on ""low"" for silkier gameplay. Admittedly, it doesn't look that great. But it plays great. That's good enough for me.On a system closer to the recommended specs, I bet it looks great. Again, download the demo, play with the graphics settings, and see for yourself.Bottom line: It's a great arcade combat racing game. Get it if you're a fan of the genre.			",418,252,28,29,19,5,13

												At less than $10 for the game and the first DLC on sale, I couldn't see how I could go wrong.  The campaign took a little over 10 hours to complete, then I tried out the multiplayer as well.  Not too many people were online, I was on pretty late, but I was still able to join games.The GoodCars racing with Machine Guns, Rocket Launcers, Grenades, Mines and Smoke ScreenGood variety of tracksGood controls with controller supportFunThe BadWith the short campaign you finish and are left wondering...what's the purpose now?For just plain racing there are better games out thereAll the cars basically feel the sameSo for what it is, it is fun.  But you are left wanting so much more.  Mostly around customization.  Should have different chassis, different wight limits that affect speed and performance, the ability to mount mutliple weapons for front or rear.  A few updates could really make this game stand out, but as is it just falls a little short.Great game at the sale price.Single Player 6/10Multiplayer TBD			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can't stand this one.  At first I considered giving a detailed point by point, but this title just isn't worth my time.  Not worth it to play, not worth it to go in depth.  I'll skim the surface.Gas Guzzlers Extreme is what it is, a brainless party racer with boring/unrewarding controls, poor track layouts, and a consistently tasteless sense of humor bashing users over the head at every turn.  It's a game where gently nudging somebody off the track is far more effective than pounding them for half a lap with automatic weaponry.  More frustrating than fun.That said, the game does look pretty good, has a decent number of race modes, and the career progression seems pretty well put together.  Even though it's got those premium ingredients, Gas Guzzlers Extreme is let down when they come together and provides a below-average experience overall.  I can picture the game having an audience--everything does.  For some, there is surely fun to be had here, but it isn't for me, and I wouldn't recommend it.			",472,168,39,69,51,7,81

												Gas Guzzlers feels like a modern version of the classic PC racer Death Rally. Fun racing, check. Weapons, check. Upgrades, check. Vaguely post-apocalyptic setting I guess, check. Random Duke Nukem appearance for no real reason, check. It's a lot of fun, has excellent handling and physics, the AI is competent without any noticable rubber-banding effects. It's pretty, sounds good, and controls perfectly.Instead of ruined opponents disappearing when they explode, their cars become firey wreckages, tumbling across the track until they come to rest and continue to burn and get in the way for the rest of the race. Smoke and dust effects are nice, and actually feel like a proper hazard when they should. It has so many nice little touches and bits of polish like that, I can't recommend it enough.

												Supports LAN games, but you will need multiple copies of the game.If using an XBOX360 controller you have to map every single button. Any game I've ever played has a default button profile. Apparently not this game! The real kicker, is you need to do this for every profile you create. Edit: We still need to map all the buttons for the XBOX360 controller, but it does remember once you do it. So, that' s good.Originally a negative review I've changed my rating to recommended, because the single player game itself is good enough. That, and the developer actually cares enough to respond on the forums which is awesome.However, the fact that there is no split screen is a huge oversight in my opinion. This kind of game simply should always have it. It's what made the original NFS, Twisted Metal, etc... games so great. Hopefully the developers will include the this feature in future releases.

												I love combat racing and this one is done right. A blast to play. It still makes me wish they could remaster the old PS1 great Red Asphault. This feels like a gritty slugfest though and its downright fun. Plays great on my gtx 1070 but then again everything does. Maybe the sequel could have selectable or creatable characters and attributes that could be raised with money or experience points. This does feel like a complete game but there just something missing. I think it may be a personality in the form of characters to fit the gameworld. Cyberpunk gear heads maybe? Good job overall though. Great heavy music and awesome visuals.			",647,174,22,84,71,5,63

												In the past i've enjoyed games like Carmageddon, Twisted Metal, Dirt Showdown and Mario Kart, so when i spotted Gas Guzzlers Extreme (Gold Pack) on sale i couldn't resist.  NOTE: Have not tried multiplayer yet since i want to get through singleplayer first. (will update review)Overall i'm very satisfied with the game it definetly satisfies my thirst for wreckage.Pros:1. Graphics are excellent, both enviroments and cars. 2. Quite a bit of destructabilty Trees/Signs not to mention chickens!3. A lot of customization possible to controller set-up; sensetitivity & mapping.4. Combat is fluid and satisfying to see the actual bangs and dents on your opponents.5. Great variaty of Maps and Modes to keep yourself occupied with.6. Creative licencing always cracks me up,  from driver voices to sponsor and AI names.Cons:1. The ghrapics optimization is lacking a little bit can get occasional FPS drop (not to unplayable extent)2. Weapon Shockwaves in certain game modes can (especially when targeted my multiple opponents) can be extremely frustratingWould definetly recommend this game to anyone who likes games as i mentioned above.

												Many of the games that have come out the last few years, have all focused on two different things; the graphics and how challenging the game is. But not many people make a game that is just fun anymore. Gas Guzzlers Extreme doesnt have the greatest graphics or is the most challenging game on the market, but what is does have is good controls, fun attmosphere, and an amazing ability to make you just want to keep playing and keep playing for hours. Many of the bigger games lose the just ""fun factor"", however, I feel and believe that Gas Guzzlers have found the right amount of challenge, good graphics, and fun to make this game addicting to all gamers, weither they be noobs or vets, this game is for all.

												7/10Pros:-Intense car combat that has you run around the map picking up powerups, weapons and repair kits then blasting your opponents to bits ala arena shooters like Unreal Tournament.-Satisfying and accessible arcade handling model that still requires finesse to master.-Many tracks with reverse variant across a large variety of environments.-Maps have good layouts and powerups are placed well.-Good amount of cars modeled after their real life counterparts.-Many unique weapons to choose from.-Good postfx (e.g. when hit with a heavy weapon, the screen turns grayscale and depth of field is applied).-Good damage modeling.-Challenging especially when set on higher difficulty settings,Cons:-Campaign is quite shallow.-AI rubberbands too much.-Graphics are a little outdated.-Online is (mostly) dead.Overall, it is a good old-school style car combat/racing game but it lacks depth to have lasting appeal.

												This is one of those hidden gems and I would even say with proper advertising this is one of those games that would get even more attention then it currently is.  Its one of those Mario Kart games for adults as what Blur was advertised even though it didn't have the roughness that I expected though it was a fairly good game.  But this game right here if your a fan of Twisted Metal any other games in that genre then you'll love this one.  Bullets, speed and so much action you'll be begging for more.  I can't wait to get back to this game.  Go and do yourselves a favor pick this one up but do remember you have to have a fairly decent computer to run the game it runs heavily on the graphics card which I found out when I first bought the game.  The cards were overheating like mad not only cause the game is so dependent on the graphics card but yeah its been a year since I cleaned this computer out.  But hey after cleaning it out this game runs superb and ran at Ultra settings.			",445,74,49,20,19,6,33

												An excellent update of the old school vehicle combat genre. Gas Guzzlers plays beautifully, and has great graphics to boot.The character voices are also fun, I especially like the Duke Nukem inspired one.However, it cannot justify its full price. This is a game you play for an hour or two, then do something else. Sure I will come back to this, but it's not a 20+ game for me. Perfect to pick up though whenever it goes on a good discount!

												Hands down one of, if not THE BEST combat racing game I've ever played.The graphics are gorgeousThe sound effects (Weapon and engine sounds) are amazing.The ability to upgrade your car is awesome, The AI is pretty brutal.There are a few annoying things, but over-all they're very minor and doesn't distract from the game much. I would give this a VERY STRONG recommendation if you were a fan of Twisted Metal and the like back in the day.			",202,36,9,47,15,1,33

												There is a fairly good speed simulation in there. And a rather wonderful chicken soup recipee !The game is very arcade-like. The fun parts come from the speed, the boost-inducing drifts, the chaos that spreads throughout the battles (deathmatch, cap the flag...).The humor should be given a thumb up too, for the effort.The levels are nice, though after five playful hours I'm yet to notice a strong evolution in their design.Recommended with some Creedence Clearwater Revival as a background music ~!! Warning : No local multiplayer as of yet !!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am not really a racing fan and my favorite racing genre is demolition derby and combat racing to be exact however its been a long time since I had played one (way back the PS1 era). This game contains all the things that I want in a racing genre: zombies (DLC required), demolition derby, solo and team combat racingPros:+Developers are active in steam forums which is extremely rare to find base on personal experience+Contains all or at least most elements of combat racing (Demolition Racing, Power Race, Team and Solo Combat Racing and even zombies if you buy the DLC)+The game is user friendly in terms of difficulty and it is adjustable just in case you have difficulty playing with harder AI+AI is skilled and can offer challenge in harder difficulties+A lot of tracks to choose from+The number of vehicles available seems fine (but I want more)+A lot of weapons to choose from+A lot of game modes to choose from +Specs for this game is not highCons:-The player needs to finish some parts of the campaign to unlock some vehicles, skins, parts and tracks-Demolition derby mode seem to lack some flavor to the game like adding real ""banger"" themed vehicles which are really meant for such game modeConclusion:This game is a must have for those players who are into combat racing because it offers a lot of game modes than most racing game I know for PC which makes this game less boring in the long run. This game is worth every penny and a steal if you managed to buy it on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really well made, if you're a fan of driving, shooting, or even both, you're going to love this.  Imagine PimpMyRide but with more guns, and blow up dolls in the trunk. This is that game.  Ever played Twisted Metal or Vigilante 8 for the Ye Olde PS1? This is it, in HD and remastered. With online play, and more vehicles, customization, progressiveness, weapons, maps etc.The only legitimate downside I have with this game, is that the online play is kinda... Empty would be the word?Don't get me wrong, finding friends and crashing mindlessly into them with a Reliant Regal straight outta Peckham, or even a Yugo (Oh, you all know of that one, surely.), all the way to fast sports cars is absolutely amazing fun, but really, not many people play online.So to really just TL;DR it, as most people see a wall of text and are scared♥♥♥♥ing amazing HD remaster of your favourite titles such as Twisted Metal and Vigilante8Customization, cars, fun easter eggs, fluid gameplay and driving, ♥♥♥♥ing -GUNS-. A lot of guns.If you're a fan of driving pick it upIf you're a fan of shooting pick it upBut be wary of the empty servers. There is a group of people that plays the game almost 24/7, so you can join with them, but other than that, get some friends to go with you, or roam the empty servers :P9/10, just because of the servers honestly, greatly recommended.

												Awesooommeee !!! Here is why:Gas guzzlers is a survival action racing game with 3 types of races. A traditional circuit race with no guns, a battle race with guns and a knockout game with guns. There are different cars, upgrades, some customization and weapons. You will unlock these elements as you progress through races, without a story, and you will be able use them in a quick race. I think this game is the racer point of view of the Death Rally.Pros:- Very nice visuals and explosion and damage effects- Not much of a soundtrack but suits well with the concept of the game- The handling mechanic is not realistic in arcade mode. If you disable the arcade mode it is still no necessary to use driving techniques. But this game is not about driving, it is about explosive driving.- There are like 20 different cars or more and each one has its own upgrade limits. Customization is the same for every car and it is consist of paint, sticker, rims and weapon loadout. So the unique feature about the cars are their upgrade capabilities.- You do not have to buy new cars everytime they become available. The progress is fast and you will be able unlock half of the cars and have money to buy any of them in about 3 hours. If you don't buy new cars, the game does not include put them as rivals in races. This is usefull if you want to make money with the same car.- There are variety of weapons. I am half way the game and did not use all of it but rifle-like weapons have some locking mechanism while you are driving. So you don't have to aim or lock on an opponent.- Your drivier is commenting time to time in the races. You can choose clean language or otherwise for you character.- You can enjoy quick race and multiplayer for a long time after you complete campaign.Before cons, a brief comparision with Blur and Split Second:Blur was just like this game with its own driving mechanics. It was not this kind of explosive.Split Second is the explosive racing alternative but it has controlling issues and it is fast explosive action.This one is in the middle. There is explosives but not too much exhilarating.And cons:- Do not forget to disable Vsync. It causes a little bit tearing to turn it off but the game has a few optimization issues and frame drops to 30 from 60 makes it unplayable. With vsync turned of, it is cool.- There is no proper introduction or tutorial. You have to figure it out yourself.Summary: A mix of Blur and Split second. I think it is  worth its price. Turn the Vsync off :D			",103,16,21,2,17,0,18

 I've looked for more than a decade  for a spiritual successor to some of my favorite high-octane battle-racing games:   Vigilante 8   and   Full Auto.  If you were too, look no further.   Gas Guzzlers eXtreme,   though crudely named,  has everything those games had and more.  I have to say, in the beginning, I was  very  skeptical. The game's menu and overall initial attitude made it look as if it just another hastily put together project by a teenager with Unity assets. However, upon actually getting into a game, my view completely changed. Sure, some of the reflections still looked a little overdone and typical of a generic racing game, but that's where any similarites ended between the two. The rest of the game is top indie-quality, by which I mean no condemnation; rather, I say it because it's got more charm and heart put into it than a AAA title of the same name could with the budget the developer had. They definitely squeezed everything out of the engine they used. Visuals are top-notch, and the game is  well-optimized  with  plenty  of options, only lacking borderless windowed support, but not something most independent games have anyways. Plenty of modes (Deathmatch, CTF, Battle-Races, and then just straight-up vanilla racing, with a few explosions added in for good measure) plenty of guns (chainguns, rocket launchers, mortars, and even the legendary railgun from Vigilante 8), and plenty of cars to fill them with (parodied versions of Ford offerings, Pontaics, Mazdas, and even a Lambo), with multiplayer support included, too. I have to say, in my experiences with studios I've never heard of prior to buying a game, only rarely have I ever seen a multiplayer game play so smoothly, much less a racing one. Hardly any issues, besides the fact that the Steamworks invite system doesn't seem to properly work with this title. Even so, the game has enough variety in servers to quickly refer a friend to the one you're joining, or a direct-ip input option to refer them directly to your server.This game had everything I was looking for in a quality game in the same vein as the death-race games of old, and I  heartily reccomend  it to anyone even considering the game if you had any interest in the genre; it's the bee's knees.★★★★★★★★★☆			",373,47,8,31,21,3,25

												I like cars with guns! if you like cars with guns, then you will surely like this game too. Gas Guzzlers Extreme is the game most like Interstate '76, since.... Interstate '76.  The game has alot of customization options from Graphics settings to Gameplay. I like how you can choose to play it more ""Arcade"" or ""realistic"".  I'm having alot of fun with it set on realistic and using my logitech racing wheel. The cars handle well, and the physics are near perfect. One thing i'm not sure i like, is the fact that you have to collect and use ""nitro"" boost. You will not win any races without nitro boost. Having said that, i still love this game!Is it worth the $$$? If you have been looking for a car driving game with guns, i believe you will be glad you got this game.  I got it on sale for $10, and at that price i'd consider it a steal.  I'd still be happy if i paid full price.  Can't comment on multiplayer at this time as i have only been playing the campaign.

												It's like Mario Kart on steroids. Or you could almost describe it as Serious Sam if Serious Sam was a car-based game, at least in attitude. Cars! Guns! Explosions! Arnold's voice over! What else do you need?To be a more honest reviewer, I should play this game more before writing a review but I've played the open beta/alpha and also enjoyed it then. On the negative side, it could use more voice overs characters as they can get a bit tiring. For multiplayer, it'd be great to have a server filter to weed out empty servers but at the moment, there's a lot of empty servers so hopefully it'll pick up soon. Also missing is a split screen option and at the moment, devs are saying they'll ""look into it"" but I'm cautiously hopeful. But overall, if you're into racing games, especially the small niche of destruction derby/racing-type games, then I definitely recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's an okay game and surely one of the best car combat racing games in last few years. For a Slovenian guy, since the game is from croatian developers, the references in game are a nice add-ons, like zastava cars, posters in the garage, music etc.. You don't see does kind of references everyday.Few remarks:As in many racing cars; the catch-up feature in single player is turned on by default and you can't switch it off. In general, I hate catch-up idea system, cause I like realism in consistant driving and if you're better than others, lap them, or vice versa they'll lap you. I know it's an arcade racing game based on combat, but still, could there really be no option switching it on/off?The other remark would be, it's performance wise very demanding. So if you don't have a very powerful machine, don't expect the game will run smooth on high graphic settings.			",142,37,14,19,9,0,25

												This game is fantastic and very underrated! Think NFS: Hot Pursuit made sweet sweet love to Full Auto and you have a very fun combat racer! Includes deathmatch arenas, battle racing as well as non-weapon races. The announcers are also a blast from the past such as Duke Nukem, Unreal tournment shouts and Arnold Schwarzenegger!

All is extremely well-made !- Great arcade gameplay, skill required- Solo addictive and efficient (no boring scenario ; just money, customization and races)- Challenging AI- Good balancing- Variety of cars and tracks- Awesome graphics (really !)- Brutal sound effects (american v8 lover, I am !)- Very cool soundtrack (rock and metal)- Online works excellently well, but, as this game is underrated, not lot of people, but enough to play it, even late in the nightIf you like Mad Max, nitro and rock'n'roll, then this game is for you !

												So you grew up playing or having played twisted metal,destruction derby and carmageddon.Well then your going to love this game as it contains elements of all three games.Think of it as mario kart for grown ups.To start with the game itself is a  full blown arcade racer,that doesnt take itself to seriously (with opponents names like Tai mi shu,Jacque strap and Robbin banks)its all about fun,oh and you also get to drive with your girlfriend as pasenger from time to time.Race,blast and smash your way to victory as you work your way up the ladder to become no 1.The only downside to this game is that there isnt a gas guzzlers extreme 2.Buy it trust me you will love it.

There is always something going on, ""so, you are in the first place ey, well, guess you didn't see that invisible car with the roof-mounted missiles"". This is like all those old fps car games like vigilant 8 and so on, mashed together with some mariocart-ish power-ups. Throw in some bad and sleazy comments, and i'm sold.

												Have been looking for a fun car carnage style game for a while. Played next car game: wreckfest, was dissapointed. Played the new Carmageddon and it is fun, but was missing something. Turns out that what Carmageddon was missing was nice visuals, better control of cars and lastly ... shotguns and rocket launchers.The different modes offer a bit of replayability. If you just want to straight up race in super cars, you can. If you want to blow stuff up with a grenade launcher in a reliant robin, you can. The zombies DLC adds another reason to buy this aswell. Waves of zombies, cars, guns and power ups. great stuff.  ",62,10,1,14,7,0,20

The Game that the movie Death Race should've spawnedLike a grownup MarioKart, with a great soundtrack/announcer voice, arcade racer-esque feel, and a decent variety of game modes. Issues sometimes arise in Last Man Standing when you and one other driver are left, as the AI is programmed in a way that as soon as it drops below about 10-15% health, it runs for the hills and collects the myriad of fast-respawning repair powerups to bring it to full health, and then the process repeats itself for far too long. However, the battle/knockout races are the best part of the game, and the surprising variety of tracks and cars only builds upon it. There are a healthy dose of pop culture references in the pseudo-real cars and the sticker customization, including the well-done sponsor teams. The sponsor mechanic is intriguing, and would be much more so if restarting the race without penalty didn't exist. The online is entertaining, but a relative ghost town, so even though there are bots to fill in the races, bring friends. Also, the balancing online between cars is a little excessive. All cars and weapons are available regardless of campaign progress, which is nice, but customization of parts and color scheme is nonexistent, which removes some of the satisfaction when you get a kill and your opponent only sees a generic car drive past his totaled wreck. Also, all cars can race against each other and keep up, which is a nice idea in theory but becomes slightly ridiculous when a pseudo-Fiat can overtake a pseudo-Lamborghini. If the online experience had a similar progression system as the campaign, with money earned based on race position that can be used to buy cars, upgrades, and weapons, and the same sponsor mechanics, it would be a near-perfect online experience. As it is, it is entertaining if playing with friends, but doesn't have that same addictive, satisfying quality that many online FPSs a la Call of Duty/Battlefield or MMORPGs a la World of Warcraft have. The graphics are quite nice as well, and the damage done to the cars is impressively realistic. The game also has full controller support, which is a godsend, as the keyboard controls are not nearly as intuitive.Despite the shortcomings I experienced - which were surprisingly few, to my excitement - that included a sponsor mechanic that fails to live up to its lofty potential, overabundance of repair powerups, and the lack of a robust online community with customization and progression, I highly recommend this game if you want to play an aesthetically pleasing racing combat game with a higher than average replayability. Seeing a car flip through the air after hitting it with a mini-nuke is one of the most stisfying experiences I've had in a long while in a racing game with realistic graphics. If you and a couple of friends can regularly get together to play this hidden gem of a game, buy it in a heartbeat.			",158,24,11,9,27,2,30

Multiplayer supports teaming up to squads for non-lonely-wolf competitions, but as well the classic Mad Max mode aka last man standing against the world. And I (also playing the matron of grafic hours, BF4) call that game a real four-wheel-titted beauty, yes it's 90-60-90. So ask yourself: How could you decline for that small fee?

It took me only 5 minutes to decide to buy the full version with the DLC's.  Even at full price I say its worth it but on sale its a bonus.  I have only played with my xbox controller and the controls and handling of the cars was very crisp and accurate. I believe you can use a steering wheel but I prefer a controller for this type of game. I love shooting games and also driving games so this is a no brainer for me. Its a lot of fun and the DEVS deserve a huge pat on the back for this.			",297,36,49,12,29,3,26

												I love me some arcade racing. Gas Guzzlers delivers.Fans of cars and explosions will have a blast zooming around the game's large selection of tracks across a variety of environments, including deserts, snowy mountaintops, tarmac tracks, and backwoods trails.There's a good selection of cars and even more weapons to equip them with, as well lots of other unlockable goodies to upgrade and decorate your cars. The solo campaign is great, but beginner racers might find it slightly difficult. The AI racers also all have really stupid (and frankly immature) names too, but that's not really a huge deal I guess.Controls are responsive, and gameplay is tight and rewarding; there's something satisfying about blasting away your fellow racers, or forcing them to crash into things. You may also find it's reminiscent of kart racers like Mario Kart and Diddy Kong racing as you dash around collecting powerups, repairs, and cash bonuses.There's also a wealth of multiplayer modes, so you can choose your flavour and start blowing up your friends however you like.I highly recommend this one, can't get enough of it.

												This game is byfar one of my favorite purchases to date,it also helps hone your problem solving skills. Problem: Some♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in a Civic with a shotgun is shoting at you. Solution: Charge up your dual miniguns and drift around a corner in your Lancia, then send that Toretto wannabe to hell looking like a peice of swiss cheese. Problem: A Robin Reliant is helplessly roaming around in the middle of a demolition derby.Solution: Aim and hold the boost key,the resulting efffect is pretty satifying. Lets just say while you can't ""Clarkson"" it,you sure can kill 'em.The moral of the story is very simple, BUY THIS GAME IF YOU ENJOY CARS AND GUNS. Also the fact that one of the sponsors names is ""Monster♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; is a nice touch. 10/10 Would swiss cheese ricer again.			",52,5,9,2,7,0,0

												Gas Guzzlers Extrem is a Racing & Shooting Racing game.This game should definitely not miss if you love this genre.You can compare this more to Twisted Metal or Full Auto.Fast racing action combine with big guns and explosions.Graphically it looks good and the game plays very fine.It's a easy ot learn racing games and haves a arcade racing feeling to it.I recommend using a controller with this game because makes it playing much easier.Xbox 360 controller has been used and workes perfectly with this game.So I recommend this controller to you.It's very basic racing game.. you have tournament to win and race and shoot your way to the first place.It's haves a lot of variation of gameplays... single race.. last men standing and deathmatch.This variation will keep you playing for a while and keeps te game fun,Upgrading your car is also possible the best part is .... MORE and BIGGER guns !!!Bots are great opponents and also a nice game to play alone.Cool game for many hours of fun and you can definitely recommend this !!I give it a 8/10 score !!

												As close to Twisted Metal as you can get on PC without having to use an emulator.Excellent selection of game modes, from your normal Deathmatch with weapons scattered around the map (ala Twisted Metal), Destruction Derby (no weapons, just tons of ramming into each other!), Racing (no weapons, just ramming into each other and trying to win the race), Death Race (racing with guns enabled on the tracks), Survival (comes with the Full Metal Zombie DLC, a very fun co-operative mode where you and friends survive 10 increasingly hard waves of zombies and creatures), Defend the Base (also comes with FMZ DLC, this time you and your friends protect your base from incoming hordes of zombies), as well as a few others I'm forgetting at the moment.There's a TON of vehicles to choose from, including spin off versions of the Delorean, the Interceptor from Mad Max, the Dodge Charger, a very sexy Lamborghini, a Mini Cooper, among many, many more. I've not counted, but there's at least 20 or so vehicles in the game. You can customize each vehicle with skins, customized license plates, change the color of your rims, upgrade your parts and weapons, etc. The controls work great, even with a keyboard, though I prefer using an Xbox 360 controller, which the game supports perfectly (just plug it in, launch the game, and you're good to go), The developers made the vehicles feel weighty, and it feels great when doing races. This could've easily been split into two different games, a car combat game and a straight racing game, and they'd both feel great to control.There's a good selection of maps, which is always a huge plus for any car game. The graphics look really nice, too, every map and car looks nicely detailed. It isn't Gran Turismo levels of graphic fidelity, but for me the graphics in this game are perfectly fine.I highly recommend the game, I've had a blast with it so far, especially when playing with friends, and I'd also recommend the DLC. Both of them add a handful of extra tracks, the zombie DLC is incredibly fun, especially the Survival mode, and there's a few cars added as well from the DLC!			",693,128,22,58,38,2,37

												I like this game, kinds brings back memories of Twisted Metal. I got it on sale with the DLCs. Career is cool. I hope to play it a lot more with you on my YT gameplays. You can race races you're good at too make money to get better cars and unlocks until you get confidence to race others. I wish there were more people playing online, that's the only way to really enjoy the DLCs. I have some gameplay videos on it if you want to see it in action. Let me know what you think, it's definitely appreciated :).

												Post Completion Edit: Took me around 15 hours (some hours dont display due to offline mode) to beat the campaign on HARD difficulty, which is the third of 5 difficulties, on this difficulty, the AI cheats a bit to win, but if you make sure to grab all power-ups, winning is fairly easy.If you are a fan of arcade combat racers, this is a good pick, altho I recommend waiting for a sale to get it with all dlc (adds cars/modes/maps) Gus the Gazelle: Exterminate is very reminiscent of Twisted Metal, Full Auto (this is the one it resembles the most) and Interstate games, but it's only closed track or arena (medium size) based. There's racing with or without weapons, last one standing races/arenas with different variations that amount to an OK variety. This is all put in a similar to GRID (first one) campaign with sponsors that hire you or leave you depending on your performance. Losing does not mean that you have to retry specific races over and over because it uses a point system so you can always get even on the next race. There's also sponsor events that are played with 2 to 4 teams of racers in arenas to fight on CTF/DM/KoH modes, these events are the highlight of the game.The car aspect of the game is alright when it comes to customization, no NFSU levels but you can change rims, paint, paint type, and theres about 10 decals per car (different on each car, as they style with the body) plus the sponsor super decals that basically texture your whole car. You can also modify performance of the cars but until the last tier of cars, these upgrades are minimal. There are about 20 cars spanning 3 tiers.The main game modes are Campaign (where all the goodness is) Quick Race (you can only select map, car and weapon, laps, number of oponents and race type, although these last three must be selected by keyboard and might appear locked) and Multiplayer (which I admittedly haven't tried, because I am not interested, might be dead when you get it).All in all Gears of Puzzler: Exuberance is a good game with a lot of content even without counting the DLC.Despite the Official Sysreqs, it's a really demanding game if you turn everything on, and it's not that great of a looker.

												I've found this game to be pretty fun and funny. Was in the middle of race when I looked in the back window of my car and I was apparently smuggling blow up dolls.It is a racing game so full throttle without brakes will put you in the wall. You can roll out of it, hit nitro and start spraying everyone who passed you though.My only gripe....is you will want to  play with a controller. Is a bit frustrating trying to utilize all the functionality via keyboard.Multiplayer isn't dead, but it's certainly not full of players. Also mics are open. Played an entire competition listening to some Asian whispering to someone. He got my full attention via missiles. ",95,14,1,3,3,0,6

												Although it stumbles here and there, and the online servers being more or less deserted at this point, Gas Guzzlers Extreme is still a fantastically fun game. It blends arcady racing and vehicular combat incredibly well, and has plenty of content whether you come at it for the competitive and team-based multiplayer, or the singleplayer campaign that is perfectly paced with enough carrots to keep you interested throughout the 10-ish hours it will take to complete.4/5Read more:http://pixeljudge.com/en/reviews/gas-guzzlers-extreme/ ",329,55,5,29,30,2,35

												Let me be honest here right from the beginning:I hate racing games.Review:The first racing game I ever got into that had some form of aggression in it was NASCAR Rumble. You could send tornados accross the track and wipe people out. It was very fun and my mom and I would play it for hours. It's near-to-impossible to find it nowadays or it's extremely expensive if you do. Gas Guzzlers Extreme fills the void NASCAR Rumble once filled.I've spent 3.2 hours straight playing this game and now it's time for a proper review. The racing is seamless to me, it's enjoyable, and it's very well balanced. The voice acting is clever and fun, and it's just an overall good game. I completed the first tournament in the campaign and love how you get to choose what to do. No liniar story. You can choose to do a race with no weapons, a race with weapons, or the popular 'last person per lap gets knocked out' race. Sometimes there are sponsors to help you get more money and their skins look awesome! There is full vehicle customization, which I love considering I owned Need for Speed on PS4 and would spend hours customizing my car to make it my own. The game in itself is very well done for someone who doesn't like racing games one bit. I very much enjoyed the sponsored events like deathmatches and capture the flag. This game has more content than I thought it would have!I recommend this game for anyone who loves racing and wants to blow other cars up. :D			",172,45,3,22,27,0,23

Yeah Gas Guzzlers Extreme is a totally fun arcade racer that focuses on racing, with heavy elements of battle. The end result feels somewhat like an R-rated version of MarioKart. Its fairly straightforward once you learn the what the few powerup symbols do. You earn money from races and then maintain a garage with multiple cars with a moderate amount of upgrades. I mean, its not like a Gran Turismo level of upgrades, but they all work and make things feel faster/more responsive/more powerful.While I definately recommend this game - the caveat is that you get it on a sale, which happens almost weekly it seems. I'd never pay the full asking price because of this.Pros:+This game is really fun when played in relatively short bursts.+Graphics are pretty nice considering it doesn't take too much to run it.+Cars handle pretty well. Everything feels good.+Lots of options all around: great selection of cars, customization options, weapons and upgrades. There is certainly enough meat on the bone here.+I haven't even gotten to multiplayer yet, but there is alot to be had with this.+From what I see there are four race 'types' - basically a spectrum that ranges from 'pure race' to 'arena battler'.Cons:-Generic heavy metal/rock music is generic.-Being an arcade racer, it is fairly simple for those of you that want more complexities associated with simulators.Totally fun for the (nearly weekly) discounted price.

												NOTE: to the people who don't like to read, there will be a short summary at the bottem of this revieuw.This game is awesome. Basicly it's a racing game with weapons and powerups combined with a strange kind of humor that if you can apreciate that kind of humor will make you like the game that much more. I've played the game for about 4 hours now and I think i've seen enough to write a revieuw about it. If I'll encounter more awesome stuff in this game I'll change the revieuw.The game starts off pretty awesome, You create a profile and get to choose a protagonist for your driver. You get to choose between 2 voices no-one cares about, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Duke Nukem. Of course Arnold and the voice actor of Duke Nukem didn't record these lines but I know who voiced Duke Nukem and I'm familiar with his Duke voice, and although the guy sounds like Duke there's a clear difference between him and Duke's voice, but the develloper went the extra mile and made him really sound like Duke Nukem and that's something I have to give them credit for. I don't know how acurate Schwarzenegger's voice is as I'm not as familiar with his voice as with Duke's voice but it does sound like Schwarzenegger.After you created your profile you're good to go. You start off with a little bit of cash so you can buy your first car, put some guns on your car and you're off to your first race. At the start there are 3 game modes you get to choose from: Power Race, Battle Race and Knockout Race. Power Race is a race without weapons but with powerups like mines, oil slicks, smoke trails nitro's and repair pickups. Battle Race is a race with powerups and weapons. Those weapons are attached to your roof and can be used to shoot the living hell out of your opponents with weapons like machine guns, shotguns and rocketlaunchers and some of those can even shoot in 2 directions so no one is safe in front or behind your car. Oh, and cars donnot respawn so if you got destroyed it's race over. Knockout Race is basicly the same as Battle Race but this is more like an Elimination race as the last player that crosses the finish line gets eliminated and that goes on till there's only one car left. There's also Last Man Standing after completing the first tournament, which is basicly a battle in an arena that ends when only one car is left.Now you might be wondering what the goal of the game is. For as far as I know it's winning all the tournaments. To get to a certain tournament you have to race untill you scored enough points to take on the tournament, you'll get points for winning races and killing opponents. Than you can participate in the tournament to compete for the most points which will be rewarded for winning and killing opponents. after you won the tournament you'll get some money and a new car. It isn't the most origonal idea but it works fine.Another big part of the game is it's humor. Not all of you can apreciate it but it doesn't affect the gameplay if you don't enjoy it but it makes the game that much better if you do. from wheird opponent names like Sum Dum Guy, Kent U. Seemee and Lui Bricant to sponsors with names like Happy Smoke that fill your car with pictures of weed if they sponsor you. I personaly enjoyed this kind of humor. Talking about sponsors, sponsorship is a big deal in this game. They will give you extra money if you win races and you'll unlock special sponsor events that reward you with a lot of cash if you win. Sponsor events are mostly team based games like Capture The Flag and Team Deathmatch. You can get a sponsorship by winning a few races in a row. If you do well they'll pay you more money but if you end up on a losing streak they will stop sponsoring you.I also want to mention something about the music in this game. The music in the main menu and during the races isn't anything special, but it isn't bad either. it pretty much concists of generic metal tunes that will get you in the mood but nothing memorable. The music in the garage however concists of things like country, jazz and I even heard the Dutch and American national anthems, it just adds to the fun factor of this game.The only downsides to this game are the ability to restart races during a tournament which alows you to try the smae race over and over again untill you win and the amounth of racing tracks. There aren't that many which can make the game repetitive. I didn't think it was a big deal because I had a blast playing this game no matter what track I was playing and it is 3 times cheeper than most tripple A titles but keep that in mind if you want to buy it. Also the game is pretty easy on it's default difficulty setting as you will barely lose a race so sponsors keep bringing in more money and you'll become too rich. I don't say this to critisize the game it's just to tell you that if you want a chalange you should crank up the difficulty. You can also change the difficulty later on so you don't have to do that while creating your character.Long story short it's an amazing game. If you want to play a Racing game as Duke Nukem or Arnold Schwarzenegger with  more action than just driving around in circles then this is the game for you, races are fun and the gameplay mechanics work very well. The only downsides are te ability to restart tournament races and the amounth of racing tracks but that can easily be justified by the game's relatively low price tag. Therefor I give this game an 8/10			",330,53,22,35,75,5,62

												This game has tracks that are blatent remakes of some from A LOT of different popular racing games from the past (Trust Me it's a GOOD thing, some are based on REAL world racing tracks though, so I guess technically those aren't ripoffs), then they add variations, mirrored mode (confuses the heck out'a My dyslexic azz), racing modes with no weapons, with JUST the drop types (Mines/oil-slicks/smoke-screen), and with full on weapons! (The racing is like this nasty, yummy, mix of (depending on the mode) NFS Underground2 (EZ drifting to gain NO2), Midnightclub Street-racing (the full on weapons racing), Spyhunter (the OLD retro game, in the mode with just drop weapons racing), Twisted metal (the Deathmatch modes), Vigilante-8 (also the DM, & CTF, team modes), Burnout (the fragging other racers by hitting your boost then ramming them), Grid/Gran Tourismo (the REAL racing tracks), Dirt (the AWESOME rally tracks).This all come in a pacage with AWESOME graphics, smooth controls, VERY scaleable options so this game will run on ANY PC with enough tweeking (for weak PCs try the pixal scale % option out). Controls great with a KB (I've heard), and great with a controller. Even with most'a the graphics turned down to run this game on My laptop, it STILL looks easily as good as say Fuel, or NFS World.Online is where this game is BY FAR the best overall car game going right now, there's servers (dedicated run by the company) ALL over the world, so you can find one where your ping will be a low #, there's servers for different skilled drivers, servers that are race only, deathmatch only, CTF/DM only, and some that are a mix of them. All of the servers I've been on had voting turned on, you can join an empty server, vote to change the options the way you want (Add/remove bots 1 at a time, bot difficulty (6 levels), team/single mode [yes you can race in team mode ☺], team stickers, respawn options for battle, track/map, Friendly fire, I'm sure I'm forgetting some, but this game has it all! ***EDIT*** The online is FULL of cheating little Brazilians from a clan they call ""FUN"", that were also the kids who beta tested this game, they cuss people out, know every single stupid trick, & will even use hack-tools on you like lag SPAM, if you DO manage to beat them, they have not only done this to Me (under more then one name, so they didn't always know it was Me)... BUT they did it to no less then 7 some odd other players who responded to My Steam forum post complaining about these kids behavior... buyer beware, if you plan on playing this online, plan on getting griefed by trolls*** This is the racing equal to Serious Sam 3BFE, more options then you can shake a stick at, lagfree online play, drop in/out so no waiting for others to play, everything you could POSSIBLY ask for. So far as I know there's no region blocks ect. so everybody worldwide can play, I've played on some of the EU, and Russian servers with almost no lag on My cheap/slow DSL.The single player is neat too, has lots of difficulty settings for everybody to enjoy the game, has upgrades, mods to put on your cars, ect. Oh online everything is opened already, just go setup your online profile (car, main weapon, vinyl, paint, rims/color, ect.) before you hit refresh to scan the servers. Don't be discouraged if nobody is online, people always come, & you can levelup your online profile VS bots of any difficulty you chose. Cyah online ☻			",133,4,24,8,9,1,1

												Massively overrated and overpriced game, even in a steam sale. After playing the grid, gt, burnout game, this game feels tired and washed out after 5-10 minutes of gameplay. The action is just monotonous and repetitive, I mean the graphics are kind of nice, 8/10, but it just lacks style or artistic quality. It just feels like, the entire game was written to do the minimum amount of work to please a manager. It just doesn't feel like anyone's soul went into this game.Basically this is wipeout 2097, but wipeout 2097 had better style, concept and art. Even though wipeout's graphics is far more pixelated than this, it's a far more enjoyable game.It just feels like there is something central missing from this game, and I just can't put my finger on what.

												I played before buying Gas Guzzlers Extreme the standard edition (Gas Guzzlers) which wasn't published on Steam but on Desura. I had spent hours and hours with the standard edition. It was great. Cool soundtrack and a fresh racing experience.Now I tried the Extreme version. It's almost a little bit better. For anyone who likes action racing games it's a must have. On my Lenovo N586 (AMD A8-4500M, 8 GB RAM, ) it runs almost very good with ultra preferences on 1366x768px. If I remove a few it runs perfectly smooth. My Desktop (AMD Phenom II X6 1045T (6x2,7GHz, 8GB RAM, 2 GB nVidia Geforce GTX 660 TI OC) runs the game perfectly on Ultra preferences on 1920x1080px.			",1323,511,79,234,269,9,351

												Love the cars they all look unique and you can paint them and put stickers on them. Sponsers are a great addition. The cars and tracks are very well detailed and the AI is very tough without feeling cheap. Multiplayer is nice however the game comes with enough content to keep most people happy. I also liked the music and sounds. The game tracks do get a lot better the more you get into the game. Snow, hot air ballons and more. The tracks are very well done. I really like this game. A lot of the cars are name brand cars you will know right away however they are all called something different in game. The more I play this game the more I like it. Its not perfect but its darn close. I still feel like as great as this game is. I think its missing something and I can not put my finger on what. However that aside its still one solid racer and if your a racing fan and want to blow up other cars this is the game for you. The game does come with many modes, one is no weapons for the purist of hearts however the only way to go up in ranks is to do the tournaments and they do require hurting other cars.  Great game.

												The Game + Lots of action and explosions+ Loads of different modes+ Some of AI drivers have actually pretty funny names+ Enough different cars (not licensed but real world counterparts can easily be recognized)+ Multiplayer has dedicated servers+ Good performance+ Soundtrack is quite fitting for a game of this type+ Fittingly arcadey driving model and damage modeling- Could have better graphics- Driver voice can get annoying with time (can luckily be disabled)- Some of the weapons seem useless- Not much players at the time of writing in multiplayer- No split-screen multiplayerOther+ Development facts in the Credits (Quote: ""73 dollars and 20 cents were collected in the communal piggy bank for cosmetic surgery that will put a smile on the face of the saddest team member."")I recommend this game for fans of Interstate, Twisted Metal and other vehicular combat games.

												I played before buying Gas Guzzlers Extreme the standard edition (Gas Guzzlers) which wasn't published on Steam but on Desura. I had spent hours and hours with the standard edition. It was great. Cool soundtrack and a fresh racing experience.Now I tried the Extreme version. It's almost a little bit better. For anyone who likes action racing games it's a must have. On my Lenovo N586 (AMD A8-4500M, 8 GB RAM, ) it runs almost very good with ultra preferences on 1366x768px. If I remove a few it runs perfectly smooth. My Desktop (AMD Phenom II X6 1045T (6x2,7GHz, 8GB RAM, 2 GB nVidia Geforce GTX 660 TI OC) runs the game perfectly on Ultra preferences on 1920x1080px.			",1323,511,79,234,269,9,351

												Have you ever watched Death Race and wondered how would it feel to race in it? Have you grown out of Mario into bigger, badder car fights? Well... THIS is the game for YOU! Very fun, good graphics, a lot of upgrading, racing, shooting, killing, exploding. Its a good game to pass time and spend a lot of hours on. If you like racing, but hate the boring progression of simulator racing - this will do you some good.There is a lot of different types of races, random events, and just pure fun moments (capture the flag in the craziest mode). I got this on sale and I would really reccommend it. By the time you get to the faster cars, races becomes crazy and totally absurd!			",162,17,3,19,14,0,18

												for those who remember the days of Activision's Death Track from the 80's for the pc, you will love this. You can pretty much do anything that death track could do except fire caltops. The only downside to the game is that for looking back, in any cam view, you have a rear view mirror. You actually have to look back via gamepad/key bindings to see what's behind you. As for variety of customization, it starts slowly and allows you to enjoy the build up of your cars you own (you can own multiple cars). Good variety of race types and tracks too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm giving it a thumbs up because Steam doesn't offer more options for reviews, and I don't feel like it really deserves a thumbs down.  I bought this during the Christmas sales and initially it was good fun.  I loved the stupid humor and the drivers' names would make Bart Simpson proud. It was fun to drive around and shoot at the AI cars. For about 2 hours...  After 2 hours I'm already at the top of the singleplayer rankings. (in game, not a worldwide leaderboard, just to make that clear) It's gotten kind of old already as well.  I pretty much only like the Battle Racing, and kind of like the team deathmatches.  The regular races are just dull to me.  I had more fun with Post-Apocalyptic Mayhem (which you can routinely get for a couple bucks on sale) than this. A bit disappointed, but not to the point of giving it the dreaded thumbs down.Never tried the multiplayer because frankly I'm just not interested. If Twisted Metal 2: World Tour is still your favorite car combat game of all time, this won't change your opinion.  But you might get a few hours of fun out of it. Just buy it on sale...

												There are suprisingly few combat racing games, but after playing this I realize it's because they know this can't be topped. Aside from being just a good driving game the combat mechanics are implemented well (it is suprisingly not difficult to hit another moving car from your moving car). It is also quite hilarious; the racing opponents have some great names. If you liked the movie Death race then you'll enjoy this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is awesome but if you try using a very low end steering wheel like a Logic3 TopDrive GT, you will hit everything in sight. Not in a good way but I suppose that is the wheel's fault not the game's so stick to the keyboard or gamepad unless you have a good steering wheel. Anyway this game is like if Burnout 3 and Twisted Metal had a baby.  It has a certain sense of humor that takes me back to when I was little when butt jokes were funny and I really appreciate that. I normally don't really laugh at stuff like that but this game was able to make me laugh quite a bit. The graphics are stunning for an indie title and the controls are solid. It has a good original soundtrack that is very suiting to the play style and the weapons are very satisfying. You can even select an exaggerated Arnold Schwarzenegger or Duke Nukem as your driver's voice. That alone should make you want this. Come on, click that little add to cart button.  Now.  Anyway in all seriousness this game is very entertaining, Has a decent price, is great for fans of the car combat genre and is an overall great buy.			",247,5,14,3,9,1,1

												Just a few days ago I remembered playing a game called ""Have a nice day"" or something along those lines and thought ""Damn, this game was fun, I'd like to see a game like that again"".Then I saw a review of Gas Guzzlers Extreme by some cynical british dude while it was actually on sale on steam. It pretty much looked like the game I remembered, but with decent graphics.So, I kinda had to buy it and I enjoyed it a lot so far =)It could use a few more weapons, but to be honest, I couldn't think of anything really missing. The basic weapon roles are filled (machine gun, shotgun, rocket launcher).I'd like to mention one more little thing, because it's something I haven't seen in a while: If you kill a car in a race, it actually is out of the race. It's not reset after a short delay or any of those shenanigans, you can enjoy watching it burn where you shot it lap after lap =)And you can win a race early simply by wrecking all opponents.So, I guess my point is: It's more a shooter with you sitting in a car than a racing game with the occasional shooting.Car handling is decent and enjoyable, but obviously not realistic in any way or form.I'd give it a 8/10, highly recommended if you want to shoot a driver if he dares to drive ahead of you.

												If you're like me, you're very skeptical of racing games. Especially ones that include weapons against your opponent. Hell, we haven't had great ones come to mind for years (Carmageddon, Diddy Kong Racing, etc). So what makes this one stand out?Everything. This game spoils you with some seriously cool graphics, gameplay, and humor right from the get-go.*WARNING - THIS IS NOT A DRIVING SIMULATOR - TURN AWAY AND GET ASETTO CORSA OR WHATEVER IF YOU WANT THAT KIND OF GAME*What kind of cool graphics? Well, let's just say this game isn't going to run smoothly on your old 2009 PC. I'm fervently against graphics-over-gameplay gaming, but this is so beaufitul and the way it plays is so much fun that I can't wait to run it when I get my GeForce GTX 770 in (planning on running two of them, but I'm getting off-topic). So I guess I'm kinda griping and praising the game at the same time, with saying it's ""necessarily beautiful"" and if you don't have a PC that's capable of running it without horrible lag, it's going to affect your gameplay a TON (perhaps even unplayable).Where do I begin about the gameplay? You drive a car, shoot opponents, win, get money. It's not that easy, though. There are different types of races available that you need to get to know to advance yourself in the ""Career Mode"". Tons of tracks. Tons of cars. Tons of weapons. Tons of playability when you mix and match all three. As I write this, I'm only 4 hours into the game, and I'm blown away. I picked this up for $10 on a sale, but I would be happy paying the $25 had I known about it's existence prior to clicking on the ""Weeklong Deals"" button.The humor? It's all around. If you don't have a good sense of humor, well, you're just a stick in the mud and aren't going to have a good time with the game. Yeah, it's a little juvenile in some of it's humor, but that's what makes it great. Your opponents have names such as ""Jack Kass, Luke Likesheet, and Alotta Fagina"" (you giggled at at least one of those, didn't you? ;) *snicker*). Currently, I'm driving a car that's sponsored by Buttwesser. Yes, Buttwesser. Once more... Buttwesser.9.5/10 - This game is going to get a lot of playtime from me.P.S. - Haven't tried the multiplayer, but holy crap that would be awesome.			",98,32,4,9,11,1,12

												If I'm going to be perfectly honest, 10 years ago this would have been one of my favorite video games ever. I could see a younger me, at 2 am, wired on Mountain Dew, playing this until dawn's early light started to creep through the window. Mega Race, Road Rash, Twisted Metal, they're all here. The names and some of the wording of things is a bit Meta, but entertaining. It's one of those racing games I enjoy because they're not all cutting edge and technically bloated like San Francisco Rush. If I have a complaint it's that the tiers for unlocking cars is spastic. I unlocked the first 6 cars in the first 2 hours and haven't unlocked anything since. Seriously, I haven't unlocked any new cars in the last 3 days and I the number of times I haven't come in first (And by that I mean second) You could count on one hand of a lousy shop teacher. I thought there was something I was missing. I slowed down just to kill the other cars to get bonuses, even cranked the difficulty. Nothing. I looked it up and everyone else says 'Just keep grinding and you'll start unlocking cars again'. I'm at 181 points. (Number two in the game is at like 50). If I don't start unlocking new things around 200 I might give it up... Still fun though.			",3,3,0,3,2,0,0

												This is an amazing racing game. The cars drive well and how you would expect them to, and the graphics look much better than Assetto Corsa. Though there aren't many people to play multiplayer with now it's still worth a buy for the $7 I got the gold pack for to play the singleplayer. The AI is really good and challenging and the sponsor battles/races sometimes leave me thinking ""Wow, this is really happening with bots"" or ""Wow look at those graphics"" when we get a good even game of CTF or last man standing with this booming Quake esque voice making every kill epic. The cars feel powerful and the customization diverse. I haven't had any problems with there not being enough maps either. Get it while it's on sale and try it people.			",57,6,1,2,5,2,8

												Gas Guzzlers is the perfect ""racing game"".Short:Pro:- Nice graphics- Great racing style (I use the xbox360 controller)- Perfect mix of racing an shooting- 12 Weapons - each has advantages/disadvantages- simple but good storymode- good balanced bots- you win enough cash to buy and upgrade several cars (so there is no stupid repeating of races for money like in NFS)Con:- the driver has only a few ""phrases"" - which can be annoying when you play for a long time and hear alwys the same sentences- 2 buyable addonsLong:It combines the best parts of Need for Speed racing with alot of Weapons and tactics.The game offers a total of 7 race types such as Classic Race, Power Race, Battle Race, Knockout, Capture The Flag, (Team) Deathmatch, and Last Man Standing.Everyone finds his perfect match. Do you like Racing? Go for a ""Classic Race"". Do you like slaughtering your enemies and do not care for racing at all? Go for ""Deathmatch"".The Singleplayer takes about 10-15 hours to be played through and is fun (most of the time). If you fail to win a race - just buy a better car. Luckily you earn enough money to spend it on several cars and upgrades.			",377,37,17,21,37,5,86

												Best current car-combat game period.  Runs well on reasonable hardware.  No glitching/stumbling like some others. It is pretty simple/arcade like, but that's not a bad thing.  The cars handle well with a controller, unlike some others that seem to need endless tweaking.			",108,8,4,14,24,0,22

												I really liked this game so far it has great gameplay and is really enjoyable plays like the description says. There are two problems though with this game. First on the intial launch it asks you whether or not to beep out the swear words. This function does not work. Second the game has a very poor framerate on my machine compared to GRID 2 or DIRT 3. But it is still a good game. I am hoping to see a performance boost after getting my new graphics card in the mail. Update: I got my new graphics card in the mail the game now runs very smoothly at 1080p with all settings as high as possible. The new graphics card I got is a Radeon R9 270 I was previously using the integrated graphics in my A10-6800K APU. Second Update: Developers were very helpful with responding to the issue about the swear words. Below is the explanation of how to fix this right now. ""What you can do right now is following: - go to options/sounds and set driver volume to zero or you can go to “select profile” menu, then select your profile name and choose edit button (pencil icon) and on driver voice select “none”""The developer also said the following about a future patch. ""Now, what we will do in next patch is to make this to work automatically, we will create clean version of all voiceovers so that when you select “clean language” in the profile menu everything should be fixed to work automatically. ""I would now give the game a 4.5 stars out of 5.			",28,2,28,0,9,0,1

												It would be a stretch to say there was ever a “golden age” of combat racing games, but Gas Guzzlers reminds me strongly of the better titles in the genre. While inferior aesthetically to say, Jak X, Gas Guzzlers is mechanically sound, possessing solid controls, easy to use weapons and a diverse range of cars. The physics engine in particular is well-implemented, avoiding the sense of weightless sliding about you get from games like Twisted Metal, nor the drunken careening into obstacles of Grand Theft Auto- unless you run over an oil slick, of course. It’s very easy to ♥♥♥♥ up driving controls and in a driving game, thus ruining the entire experience for everybody involved. Not so here. However, in other areas, Gas Guzzlers feels very much like the budget game it is. The music is ignorable at best and there is absolutely no semblance of plot, though there is amusing flavor text for each of the weapons and looks-real-but-has-a-fake-name cars. The campaign is structured like every other driving game ever, wherein you play a series of one-off races to rise through a leaderboard to the top, then becoming eligible to enter a tournament and advance to the next tier- three total. in this game’s case. You may receive a sponsorship and then gain additional funs from each win, and there are periodic exhibition events that force you to use a particular car and play a particular gametype but have large payouts. You unlock additional cars, tracks, parts, weapons and cosmetic customizations as you progress, most of which must then be purchased. There’s a fairly diverse range of tracks and arenas, and even gametypes featuring hordes of zombies in the multiplayer, if you have the “Full Metal Zombie” DLC. I was disappointed that no zombies appear in the campaign. However, barring tournaments and sponsored events, you may choose what type of event to play, allowing you to focus on a race type you are good at or enjoy over others. Also of note is the ability to select a voice pack for your driver, including a reasonable facsimile of Duke Nukem, though even his one-liners will eventually wear a bit thin. I must note that none of Gas Guzzler’s flaws is in its gameplay. If you like games that have cars with guns on them (and to my distress, many people apparently don’t) you will enjoy Gas Guzzlers. If you don’t… then why are you reading about one?			",332,6,5,16,2,1,15

												A fun, good looking, arcadey racing game.Reminds me of Death Rally in 3d. That works, because I love Death Rally.The cars control in a way that's fun, the weapons pack punch and are varied, and there's a number of race modes: Pure racing, racing with weapons, battle races, pure battle mode, capture the flag, last man standing, and more.I really enjoy the career mode. It consists of different races, and tournaments.The only problem I faced was that there was a bit of a balance issue, where I ran out of things to spend money on -- I kept on winning races, and was eventually able to max out my car and have a bunch of cash I can't spend piling up in the corner.

												Were you a fan of Destruction Derby 2? Interstate 76 / 82? Vigilante 8?If so, then you are like me. Naturally, this game appealed to me greatly and with the few hours I've played it it takes me back to those days of endless racing and destruction on my Playstation 1.At the start, you begin with a Reliant Robin and you'll probably think ""My word, what have I purchased."" But give it time, the races get faster and more destructive and you'll soon get addicted.Highly recommended to fans of the above games. Recommended for anyone else.			",144,39,10,21,27,1,74

												Gas Guzzlers is a great destruction racing game. Gameplay is your standard racing-with-guns experience, though I haven't seen a game like this with limited ammo before. You'll need to pick up ammo on the track if you run out. Opponents are generally beatable, but they occasionally seem to get unreasonable bursts of speed. Let me break it down:GOOD:Battle racingDecent physicsEnjoyable player investment system (Car and customization unlocks are well paced and worthwhile)Sense of humor (You can have Duke Nukem sound clips as your driver voice, the car names are all satirical, you get points for chicken squishing, etc.)Graphics look greatController SupportAnnouncer (Yells ""DOUBLE KILL"" etc. during races)EXTRA BONUS POINTS:Reliant Robin ripoff carBAD:Poor optimization (I have to turn everything all the way down to get a decent framerate at 1280 x 720. FFS I can run Assassin's Creed IV better than this.)AI sometimes feels cheatyInput lag (at least with a 360 controller, haven't tested anything else)As a last aside this exact game (so far as I can tell) was on Desura about a year before it showed up on Steam, titled Gas Guzzlers: Combat Carnage. Desura refuses to give Steam keys claiming it's an entirely different game. This seems pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to me, but I think the publisher changed since the original release, and most likely the new one didn't want to give out copies. Get this game if you like battle racing. Think VIgilante 8 or Full Auto. If it's your thing the $20 price tag isn't too much. On sale for under $10 I doubt you'll be dissatisfied even if you have only a passing interest.

												This game is fun! Alright, I read to unrecommended reviews and, they all talk about bugs, performance issues, being impossible to win, stuff like that. I have not seen any of these. I'm surprised at how bug free this has been for me, the performance is great but that may just be my really expensive gaming PC, and as far as winning, the people saying it's impossible are just really bad at it. I almost win every race. Which, is probably the biggest thing I don't like when it comes to racing games. I play FlatOut, there is no challenge at all and I'm pretty much garunteed to overlap the AI every race. This? Well, it is more of a challenge. I pretty much never overlap anyone. Which is good. The AI are actually decent at driving, unlike a lot of other stuff. And the weapons make it even more fun and challenging! Overall, this game is good. I would suggest getting it if you enjoy racing, shooting, and derbying all mashed together.			",51,2,8,11,5,0,3

												This game is stupid. This game makes me stupid. If an opponent drives too fast, I just mow him down.The driving mechanics are quite arcadey, which is great. There are different cars to buy that unlock as you progress through the game, same goes for customization options, be it for stickers, new weapons or engine upgrades.Overall, the game feels quite similar to FlatOut, but with shotguns, rockets, mines and other love machines. Haven't tried the KB+M setup as most (all?) driving games are made in controllers or wheels in mind, but it feels great on a 360 D-Pad. Shooting on the run can prove a little bit challenging at times, but there are enough options to be satisfied depending on the way you like it. If you're more of the ramming type, go for a shotgun. If you'd rather play it safe and focus on driving and shooting accurately, go for a machine gun or a rocket launcher.Game looks fine, and the graphical options are wide enough to make the game run on toasters.... this is the best thing ever!

												If you have ever played Twisted Metal or Rumble Racing, then this game will feel right at home. It is my personal favorite combat racer for the PC because of the variety of weapons, cars, and tracks. It's a great game that doesn't take itself too seriously, and the humor is fantastic. Online is lacking players, but pick up the 4 pack when it goes on sale and get your buddies together for a great time.			",279,58,16,27,22,4,34

												The first time I booted the game up, it crashed, didn't pick it up again for three months. I actually kind of figured I'd bought a dud, but figured, whatever. Maybe it'll work some other time. Finally booted it up again, and it worked...... only for the Steam controller to not work.Alright, so the configs solve the problem, remapped to keyboard controls, a quick switch in the menu and viola, I can finally play my game!So, despite a pretty rocky start, it's good. In fact, I'd go so far as to call it an unexpected gem. One of those real treats that I'm still getting from Steam, an impulse buy that is more than worth the money.A ton of unlocks, a variety of game modes with an admittedly slightly repetitive single player (start at the bottom of the ranking, race, destroy, smash your way to the top of the ranking, enter tourney, win three races rinse repeat), good soundtrack and a kind of frantic humor that otherwise would annoy me but blends seamlessly into the satisfying, visceral combat and conquest.And that's the crux of it, really: the joy of high-speed, eye-melting explosions while the faux-celebrity of your choice belts out complete insanity to the hectic crescendo of a shrieking minigun. Running through explosive barrels, crashing into other drivers, DESTROYING other cars, and generally crying blue havok refills the nitro tank and gives you a little speed boost. It's well designed, and when it works best it becomes a bloodthirty speedfreak cycle, like surfing on a wave of corpses. To summarize: some rough edges, but a heart of gold. If you can look past small annoyances, there's a lot here to love. And, ultimately, it's fun. FUN. I'm looking forward to beating the absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it.			",93,20,1,17,10,0,19

												The perfect sort of stupid fun. It makes no apologies for its ridiculousness and it doesn't need to. Fantastic at getting some actual adrenaline pumping and on the higher difficulties in the campaign it can provide an actual challenge. The races, which are the focus of the single player, are fun enough but are not the highlight of the game. The absolute highlight is the deathmatches, and capture the flag modes. Deathmatches make me amazingly nostalgic for my Twisted metal days and feel like the perfect blend of that old school gameplay with modern gaming tech. Capture the flag is a fun thing I haven't seen done in a car combat game before and actually works really well, the mad dash for the flag closest to you when the respawn is chaotic and the feeling of crashing into the opposing flag carrier, destroying them, and depositing your own flag is incredibly satisfying. A few shortcomings are the lack of clarity in how to advance in the campaign and the UI design could use some work, I found myself not being able to figure out what team I was on in a team game without bringing up the race stats on the overlay which I found a bit annoying. Additionally the Last Man Standing game mode, while very fun in multi, can be infuriating in single player considering when the difficulty advances enough the opposing AI develops the ability to know exactly where every repair powerup on the map is and as soon as you get them below half health in a fight they will turn and make a break for it. When there are multiple enemies remaining this isnt a problem as gun fire is coming from multiple directions and they usually cant make it however when it comes down to you and one CPU having to try and chase them down and finish them off before they can reach a repair powerup becomes nearly impossible and it can make the game drag on for an eternity. I had a few of them last for over 30 minutes before I decided to just give up on the mode in singleplayer entirely. Overall however this is the most surprisingly exciting I have ever found a game. I have put far more hours into it than I thought I would already and I'm just getting started.			",119,15,7,11,15,1,3

												I admit that I bought this because it was cheap and it looked fun.  After playing it I can say that it's more than worth the money - it's kind of like a slightly (cough - *quite*) arcade-y cross between the first Flatout and Carmageddon - or more simply, ""Flatout with rocket launchers"".The car physics is pretty good - not as bouncy or terrifying as flatout, but kind of reminiscent of the first Driver game, just a little tighter.  I adapted pretty quickly and found the handling easy to get used to.the environments are nice - lots of destructable things, powerups, a good sense of speed and a good sense of fun. I will admit that one of the things that sold me on the game was when i saw that I  could race in a (more or less) Reliant Robin.Definitely worth the $10 I spent for the game AND DLC, and worth it at regular price - it's just a lot of fun.

												Car combat games are criminally underrepresented on PC, so Gas Guzzlers Extreme was a game I was very happy to play. This game has multiple modes that allow players to options to choose from weaponless racing, weoponized racing, or straight up deathmatch car combat. The wacky named cars and drivers, deep voiced announcer, and cheesy dialogue all pay excellent homage to classic car combat games of the past such as Twisted Metal and Carmageddon. There are lots of vechicles to choose from and many ways to customize your vehicle with choosing between various mounted guns, paint jobs, and rims that anyone who enjoys making their game avatar their own will very much enjoy the features. Although Gas Guzzlers Extreme sufferes from some weapon balancing issues, predictable A.I., and a lack of an on screen radar, I found the game to be one of the best examples of a modern car combat game and a great appeal to old fans of Twisted Metal and Carmageddon.

Each car can be equipped with a weapon which can be purchased from the garage and used in the fire zones of each race (assuming you have ammunition). If you're are a fan of the Death Race film franchise, Mashed: Drive to Survive or Wrecked: Revenge revisited than this is the game for you.			",51,8,8,1,4,1,0

												Gas Guzzlers takes me back a few years to the days when video games were fun first and realistic last. I got it on a whim when it was on sale, and I've gotta say I'm happy with what I payed. At the time of this writing I've only clocked in about two hours, but it was two hours of explosive combat driving with the right amount of humor to leave a smile on your face. This game isn't bogged down by some stupid plot to explain why everyone attached guns to their cars, and there's no slow-moving rpg elements as you build your cars. No, this game is just full-fledged arcade histaria as you blast your way through the pack of cars while Arnold Swartzeneger laughs and screams out cheesy movie quotes. It's a fast-paced game that gives you some challenge, even if it does rely on rubber-band physics. It'll keep you playing on the edge of your seat. If you enjoyed games like ""Full Auto"", ""Twisted Metal,"" or other similar games, you will enjoy this.			",121,9,8,9,7,0,21

												I tacked this onto another purcase since it was on sale and sounded interesting-- I ended up playing this for way longer than the other purcase! It's actually some of the most fun I've had in an arcade racer in a while! What really impresses me is that all of the racing modes works really well, and switching between them keeps the game interesting. You can ditch the weapons and just race (with only pick-ups like smoke and oil slicks), or race with weapons, or really emphasize the weapons in an eliination race. But you can also ditch the race all together and do free for all team battles, including capture the flag. The free-roaming game modes gave me some flashbacks to the good old Twisted Metal days. Although this game isn't as over the top, that's still high praise.The game's got some humor, great graphics, lots to do, excellent controls, and the races feel balanced enough to be intense and challenging but fair. At this point I would have been happy to buy it for full price. Recommended!			",311,115,21,43,44,5,34

												After a couple of hours of playing this title, I'm convinced that it deserves a place in the Arcade Racer Hall of Fame.  This is a little known gem, and well worth the purchase.  I'd rank it up there with DiRT Showdown, Flatout: Ultimate Carnage and other first rate arcade racers.The graphics are great, it supports my Fanatec Porsche GT3 RSR v2 wheel and pedals, the humor is hilarious low brow and I even like the sound track music, which is a rare thing for me.I haven't had any problems, it runs fine with all the eye candy maxed out on my AMD 1090T 3.2 GHz 6-core, ATI Radeon R9 280X DC2 TOP, 16 GB DDR3 RAM machine.  Silky smooth framerates.They've done a great job with this one and it definitely deserves some attention.  I spend most of my time with hardcore racing simulations, but now and then I like to leave off the realistic stuff and go crazy with a good arcade racer,  This one fills the bill nicely.Highly recommended.

												This genre is scarce on pc. This game's a bit too demanding on hardware. it takes a bit too much firepower to take down an opponent. Making it feel a fraction too grindy. Luckily the driving and speed feel solid, car combat games often miss the sense of speed so they can focus on the combat. This manages to feel fast. Although not burnout fast unfortunately. Other than health bars being too long, the combat feels passable. Good once you start using better weapons.Overall I'd say this game is far better than a cheap indie title, and is one of the better car combat games on the pc. Full stop. I look forward to what the developers of this do next. My advice would be to make a game with the same passion and involvement, and make it a little bit more of a burnout with rockets feeling game. A cross between split second, burnout 3, and twisted metal. To me this is too much twisted metal and not enough burnout. Although everyones taste is subjective. 8/10 - Good game.

												FANTASTIC!! (maybe not outstanding, but def not ""just good"").There's not many racer type games but this one had a bunch of things I wish people would make but sadly never did... this is obviously not realistic and I wish the models had more of a Death Race appearance but gameplay wise is very fun, well worth the purchase, I realize with games you can't compare it to something else otherwise you'll find faults in it due to doing things different to say, DiRT 3 or Need for Speed. That said however, reviewing a game simply relies on judging it for what it is, what it does well and doesn't.  So what this game does well is a lot, and the multiplayer aspect is great, I've been too busy enjoying the basic campaign, forget a story, like minecraft., it doesn't exist, but like minecraft, it's fun enough without one. :) I highly recommend this, I have 200 games in my library and this is easily in my top 20.

												Very fun combat racing game. In single player you earn money by completing different race types including power race (no weapons other than traps like mines and oil slicks), combat races (full use of weaponry including machine guns, rocket launchers, etc.), and other arena-based competitions like capture the flag and deathmatch. I haven't tried the multiplayer yet.I'm not really sure how single player progression works. I got few the first few races and was invited to a tournanment, which I won. After that I was told that I had been entered into a new skill bracket, but I'm still racing all the same opponents on the same courses. I haven't even unlocked a new car for sale in quite a while.I had hoped that the game would give you more control over the visuals of your car, such as providing options for spoilers, hoods, sideskirts, etc. However, all you can customize are the paintjob and sticker (not even those if your car is sponsored - they choose the graphics for you) and some under-the-hood stuff like engine and brake upgrades.

												If you like funny racing games with great driving, smash'em up, shooting, fender benders, crashing and red neck country music then this is the game for you.After you have unlocked the cars and stuff by racing then you will be able to choose from many cars which you after purchase can customize with paint jobs and un-locked stuff.. Then you can pick your car and choose your preferred challenge and then go racing tracks unlocked by racing.. While the game delivers a very good and fun racing experience then to me the game is about having fun more than being a sim.At the moment I have only played the game a couple of hours but these hours have been very entertaining and I am having a really great time with this game. I think that the whole game is incredibly funny in it's attitude and while I am completely new to this game then I am not hesitating to recommend it to other people. Try it and join the fun :-)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm not a big fan of racing games usually, but this game is fantastic. Reminds me of the old Twisted Metal games for Playstation. It's a solid racing game but with tons of action, explosions, and even zombies. I was just going to play it for a little bit to kill some time, and I ended up getting hooked on it.The positives are the gameplay, difficulty, and visuals. The game is exciting, with guns and explosions and a few jumps. Quite satisfying. The game can get very difficult on the higher difficulty settings, which provides a great challenge. The visuals are probably the strongest aspect of this game. Very gritty, but at the same time flashy and over-the-top. Overall, it's a very gratifying experience.The downside is that there is pretty much no choice at all in terms of cars and equipment. Each new car is basically a complete upgrade of the previous car, so there's no strategy or preference at all. The best car is just the best car for everything. All upgrades can be bought, and there's no need to design anything. You just choose the best car with all upgrades, and that's the best. Would be nice to see slower heavy cars that are better for battle, or super fast cars that get wrecked easily.			",358,65,21,48,46,3,82

												The first race is a little confusing, this game could really benefit from a couple of tutorial screens before the first race to explain the controls, hud and power ups. But after a few races it all slots into place and I was driving a candy pink reliant robin with shotguns on the roof, sponsored by “buttwasser” beer, racing against characters named after Bart Simpson's prank calls to Moe's bar; how could I not love this game?The driving is smooth, the weapons are satisfying, the events are reasonably varied, there is a nice range of cars, the single player campaign is a good length, the humour is not exactly sophisticated but did keep making me smile. All in all it a very solid game.			",45,18,1,3,3,1,4

												So far, I have truly enjoyed this game.  It's pretty basic, cars with guns.  You drive, you race, you destroy.  The usual.  It's set up such that every race, you get points.  You use those points to try to climb up the leader board.  You can buy cars, upgrade them, customize them with stickers and such you earn by winning.  There's some interesting gameplay modes, including team death match and the like.  That, along with the Duke Nukem styled voice (one of the options for your character's in-game voice as you race), makes me really think back to Death Rally with this game (the original, not the remake).  There's no deep, multi-faceted story to uncover here, but there doesn't need to be.  What it does it does well, and I have a lot of fun with it.			",646,192,15,85,65,6,121

												Gas Guzzlers Extreme is a driving game with guns. It is a basic concept but works well enough to be fun and addictive. Some player may get bored with the basic concept but for those player who don't have much experience with car battle games. Then this will fill the void nicely. There is lots of upgrades, tracks & weapons to unlock as you progress through the career mode. There are three main features to customise your cars with, colour, sticker and rims. Getting through the career mode does take a bit of time and luck. It does not necessarily matter how good your are but it will help.Controls of the cars feel realistic enough. They feel heavy and planted to the ground. The control input is very responsive.The graphics are very good depending on the performance of your computer. There is an issue with frame rate dropping when in the middle of a pack of cars and going at high speed. I believes from other players that this issue does appear whatever graphic performance setup you have. So this maybe a terminal issue in the game. However the frame rate does not drop enough to spoil the game. It will take a little practice to adjust your judgement when this occurs.Sound of the cars are realistic and make controlling them feel real. Firing the weapons sound good on release and impact. The sound track of the game I am really impressed with. It sets the mood of the game just right. I only play the soundtrack during the menus. Listening to the carnage in the game play sounds just as good and feels satisfying.Highly recommend this game. There are several game play modes available offline and online.			",22,4,1,5,5,0,8

There are battle races - deathmath - capture the flag and others .You can castumize your cars and select the weapons .another good thing of this game is the servers , yes exactly the game only supports dedicated servers and there is a manual inside the game's folder which gives you an info about the game and how to open a dedicated server .the only bad thing i got is the annoying music so i muted its voice :DMy opinion : the game deserve its cheap price , as i heard that the pirated verson have a lot freezes so i recommended to buy it :)			",65,5,6,0,2,0,2

The physics are good, it's easy to drive, it has arcade car handling that is fun and easy to play.  After a few tracks you will want to turn off the cheezy in game music and put on your own music.

Most fun I've had with a car game.    At first I found the non combat races lacking.. but by the time you unlock some of the higher tier cars, even the racing without the weapons is great.    I expected the tracks to run out long before they did.   Many thanks to the developers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm not a fan of arcade racers.  The last one I played for any length of time was Gran Turismo on the PS1.  So you can imagine it takes a lot for me to drag out the thumb controller, but this game did it.  I bought it because I'm an old Car Wars player, (I still have the ziplock bag version that I purchased new in 1980), but what keeps me playing Gas Guzzlers is the fact that it's more fun than a guy should be allowed to have with his pants on.  It's not something you'll spend any marathon gaming sessions playing, mind you, but it's a great little 30 minute-per-evening game.  After commuting home from work, running other cars off the road or sticking a rocket up their tailpipe is just what the doctor ordered.One other note:  the guy who did the music in the garage should get an award.  It's absolutely awesome.  I've not heard the same thing twice.  Johnny Cash, 20s flapper songs, gospel, Laurel and Hardy, hell there's even a soccer match in Spanish.  Top notch.

												If you've ever watched the movie Death Race, this game can be called a similar replica to that movie, in terms of gameplay that is. There are few things more entertaining than raining bullets and missiles upon your foes while being in a race to the death, and if you get tired of racing, just go at it in a deathmatch and blow one another up! While the game has a crude sense of humor, which can be positive or negative, the gameplay is very smooth, the graphics are very nice, and with updates to come for online stability, things can only look better! If you want one more reason to get the game, it is very well priced.			",82,5,3,3,16,4,14

												It is really good game and I enjoyed it. I've completed singleplayer mode and here what I think.There are minuses:1) I don't like the engine, it is really wooden and sometimes unraceble.2) I don't like some tracks, they are making me angry, because I don't even see where to drive,  especialy rainy tracks, I've completed them by driving along the border and turning nitro (bad engine).Desert tracks have a lot of stuff so you can't see where are you driving (mini-map is no use here, because if you start looking at it, you'll definitely hit the wall).3) Almost all weapons are no use. My best choise is double-sided minigun, and there is no better weapon (sadly).4) I hate LAST MAN STANDING, because when there is only two players left the game can lasts forever.5) Stupid AI.Anyway, If there will be more racing tracks and better engine it would be really awesome game.I got my fun, I like this game, I haven't tried multiplayer yet, I think it's better then singleplayer.I hope this game will develop further.

												[Capture The Flag] While you are holding the flag the AI on your team refuse to defend you and will only try to ram you or drive long away from you and the opponent team AI (this mode is fun in multiplayer but in single this is bs)when AI on both teams doesn't even know how to play this game mode :/Mode is 10 minutes long and you can score 1 point and just drive to the other side of track and stay there for 6+ minutes holding the flag without you see any AI players this is no matter what difficulty you are playing on.Also some tracks is really bad optimized compared to all others tracks! this you find out about 30-40% into the gameps. the game is not as bad as it may sound""there are just these issues that you cannot look past, else this game is really fun so because of that it still gets a thumbs up!

												I didnt have big hopes for this game as most games bought today are more of the same stuff with different cars and tracks. Nothing bad about that but no new wooov experience. Anywy back to this game, short story.  2 Words: Mad Max and Death Race on steroids :)Depending on what type of race you choose you will be able to upgrade parts such as engine, brakes, tires and more. And if not satisfied buy yourself a new unlocked car. And the cosmetic yup its here as well. Paint your car, put on bought stripes, paintbrush stickers and why not some new shiny rimes  ;) The car handling and physix is spot on in this game. Love it. The feeling when you accelrate feels down to your bones.Campaign: Choose your car and upgrade it with the money you have in the begining. (Dont worrie you will earn alot more as you progress and unlock more stuff.) After that you are being showed a screen where you can pick your favourite type of race. You will progress in a leaderboard up to the top. And you will unlock more cars, parts, stripes, wepons and more depending how you beat the maps placing 1st,2nd or 3rd place. In campaign you will also get sponsor contracts where you can earn some big cash and drive their sponsored car. You can also unlock sponsor car skins wich will give you some extra cash if you use them and win any race.Quickrace: Here you can choose Car combat, Normal race, Destruction derby, Last man standing or why not zombie mode one hell of fun if you ask me. Take some friends with you for a game and you will have a blast. Iam getting this for my son thats for sure. Love it. (There are more gamemodes in the game, the above is an example.) One last thing quickrace is awesome for killing some time. In my case i have been playing quickrace destruction derby, defend base and survivor zombies for hours already. ;)Multiplayer: Is the same pure fun as singleplayer but with real people online ;)Gfx 10-10 (The quality of textures, animations and physix's is midblowing)SFx 9-10 (Sfx and music is fitting the game perfectly)Gameplay 10-10 (The car handling is one of the best i have experienced in the arcade genre)I have been trying to look for some flaws but couldnt find anything wrong with this game. My new gem in my collection for sure. I would recommend developer to have this game as free weekend, i can promise that most of all new players who didnt have a clue about this game will buy it. RECOMMENDED FOR SURE!Please note! That zombie mode is bought as DLC and i would recommend buying all DLC. Worth every £ $ €  ;)			",583,134,18,134,88,7,141

												Great game and lots of fun and challenges , only one complaint the graphics power its using does not equate to the performance  I see rendered ... Ive got some other games with as good graphics that demand far less from my system .. the exchange doesnt make any sense at all ... basicaly if you have a medium graphics card you are going to struggle with this at good settings. update // recently purchased a gtx 750 ti  card ... its  entry level in the high range of  cards and cost me only  $200 (you can probably get it cheaper but I was in a hurry) ... this game runs flawlessly in max settings ... frame rates between 50 -60  everything maxed out.   Definatley buy this game if you have a decent card ... one of the most fun games I own from steam , I love it !			",166,7,30,7,8,1,3

												This game brings the type of enjoyment I used to get out of old games like San Francisco Rush 2049!The racing is fun, the graphics are great (especially in 3D Vision), the performance is amazing (4K via DSR in 3D Vision with everything maxed and AA most of the way up), vehicle handling works well, the damage system adds a sense of risk while providing humor (such as drivers trapped in trunks being revealed once the doors are ripped off), the battles add even more fun, and all the extra game modes complete the awesome experience!Absolutely great game for those who like racing with weapons and explosions!System Specs:Case: NZXT Phantom 001BKCPU: Intel i7 3970XMOBO: ASUS Rampage IV Extreme x79RAM: 32GB 1600 DDR3 4x8GB (Quad channel)GPU: EVGA GTX 780 Classified w/ ACX coolerSound Card: Creative Sound Blaster Recon 3D ChampionRaid 1 for OS: 2 10,000 RPM 300GB VelociRaptors1TB 7200RPM data driveMonitor: Asus VG248QE 144Hz refresh, 1ms response, 80M:1 Contrast Ratio, 3D Vision supportSurround Sound: Logitech THX-certified Z-5300e			",43,16,6,0,3,0,0

												This game is alot of fun. Lots of tracks, cars, weapons and various sinister ways of exacting doom and revenge on your fellow racers. This game is what I wanted when I bought the Flatout 4 pack (which I hate).You can change your cars attributes, upgrade, gain sponsors for more money, lose sponsors, etc.The best part about being weaponized is that your skill in tactics can/could always beat the AI who would otherwise escape with an eternally full tank of boost.

												Make sure your Graphic card is above 3.0 ghz and you will like this game otherwise you won't have much fun. The graphics and game play is only as good as your computer in this case.  In other words this game would rock if I had a better computer.  As for what I observed durring my game time in the game it reminded me of the movie Death Race, pretty fun idea and game.  So have fun good luck.			",23,0,5,1,1,0,3

												This game is just awesome. It's kind of like blur but improved in every way.  The graphics are freaking awesome and the car destruction is very realistic for a video game. The car customization is very deep and detailed. The car selection is huge and so is the track selection. This is the farthest you can get from grinding. You can afford at least two good upgrades every time you win a race. Although making money is very easy, it doesn't ruin the game in any way. There is nothing that needs improving and again, this is the best racing game ever. Almost forgot, there is ale a death match mode. You drive around, picking up weapons, boosts, and health while trying to get the most kills. Simply awesome.  ",180,40,6,42,18,1,31

												Wanna know how I rate this game?... Look, this game is wayyy under-appreciated. It oozes quality and is nothing but massive fun, whether blasting zombies in this add-on, or just playing the base game. You cannot go wrong.- But rather then trying to talk about it with a massive wall of text, I think if a picture is worth 1,000 words, then a video of some of my early gameplay experience should be worth a million words...Watch my 33 minute video here (Updated):

												When I race, the game gets quite laggy, and whenever I press a button, the action happens 2 seconds later. It also takes forever for a race to load, and to get into your garage. But other than that, it's a really fun game- you get to race while shooting down opponents!!! :D And also, the names are really weird, such as: Lee Mealone, Kent Cook, Sam Urai, etc.			",10,0,0,1,3,0,0

												This is one of the best racing games I've played in a long long time. Like a cross between Need For Speed and Twisted Metal. Tons of gameplay options, unlocks, and customization. The cars are fun to drive, the tracks are cool and challenging, and the weapons are fairly diverse, with the only real obsoletion coming from models of the same guns which fire behind as well as forward. This is one of those games that is easy to pick up and hard to master; a game that I find myself thinking about in the middle of a work day or right before I fall asleep. I really admire games like that.			",49,4,7,11,4,0,8

This game runs our computers RAM % to around 90%. It also has awesome graphics but if you had a bad graphics card it could not run this game. We have 8GB of RAM and for a graphis card we have a EVGA Nivida Geforce GTX 960.I recommend this game but do nat get it if you have a bad computer.			",11,1,0,0,15,0,2

												Ok, this is a reworked version of my review so let me try this again.Gas Guzzlers Extreme is a car combat arcade racer, that type of genre that is usually missing in action when it comes to racing. There is a very high amount of cars that are parody versions of their real life counterpart (this is the only racer I know of that lets you race in a Reliant Robin), a ton of game modes,  maps, and weapons, as well as pick ups in races.. Graphics and performace wise, this game is very pretty. Really impressive damage models on the cars where they can have bullet holes, dented metal, and falling off parts. My only gripe is that there isn't that many people on the American servers, but hopefully those numbers will grow.Great game overall!			",175,26,11,10,9,2,9

												Very awesome game. It looks a lot like flatout with some new ideas. I think everyone who liked flatout will like this game. What I don't like is that the servers are empty, so you can play only singleplayer, but it's a very good game.			",55,6,3,5,3,1,5

												A racing game with a great potential.I still cannot recommend it because you can encounter an issue which makes it impossible to progress and finish the campaign (the campaign is the core of the game since multiplayer is almost nonexistent nowadays).EDIT: I now recommend this game because the issue I encountered has a fix (see comments)To be honest though I haven't played it enough to be 100% sure whether I fully recommend it after more playtime... But so far, so good!			",56,14,2,17,10,1,20

												I am a big fan of racing games that have weaponry. Especially kart racers (woefully underrepresented on PC) do something to me. I f*cking love the inspired tracks, the brights colors, the high-speed racing and the tension the weapons add. This game has at least half of those, so needless to say I love it.This game doesn't need explaining, it's an arcade-y racer with guns and cars. You drive fast and shoot hard, it's exactly what you'd expect. The game has tons of content: massive amounts of cars and tons of weaponry, a large selection of maps and gamemodes (which up until now have all been really enjoyable) and a really extensive single-player campaign mode and some interesting mechanics. You basically have to climb the ladders of your competition pool until you have the most wins out of everyone in the cup, then you can enlist in the tournament and when you win that you get a more difficult competition pool where you'll do the same. Along the way you can attract sponsors by winning frequently, who will give you extra money for donning their ads while doing well in races. There's also random sponsor events which have large prize pools and team-based gamemodes. There's a lot of variation in the campaign mode and it's loads of fun, it also lasts for a really long time if you want a good dollar to gameplay ratio. This game is amazing man, whole-heartedly recommended. If you like guns, cars and arcade games, get this. ",205,36,3,11,14,4,15

												Kinda like Flatout with less enviroment destruction but weapons added.The AI put up a race even on medium, and theres 2 modes Arcade or Normal and you can easy change anytime from main screen.Bought during sale, Zombie DLC is a good for a bit of something different.Not the most polished game, but has all you want from an arcade racer.

												""I'm just trying to get to work, and out of nowhere some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s start cutting me off, driving over the yellow line and dropping land mines everywhere.""Gas Guzzlers Extreme is an intense multiplayer racing game with AI or human opponents. The current modes include a vanilla race, one with guns, and one where the slowest player is knocked out with each lap until no opponents remain. The graphics are so stunning they actually caused my computer to overheat, yet I experienced no lag, frame skipping or input delays even on the highest graphical setting. The customization for both your car AND your driver are at a somewhat simple level that does not overwhelm the casual player but still allows for a nice level of individuality. The HUD confused me at first, but I soon understood what meant what and was having fun. Until my computer overheated. 10/10, would fire a car-mounted shotgun again.			",220,49,5,26,12,5,16

												An amusing game shy of what it could have been but none the less a blast until rot of monotony sets in.Its another game where single player campaign is more an after thought as what works so well for multiplay is either muted by dumb AI or altogether missing.With that said you get a reasonable choice of cars, arms and upgrades to keep you interested along with if your into that sort of thing, NFS style cosmetic kit. The graphics are nice, the handling well done and a nice choice of tracks/arenas.If your looking for single player campaign action this may well fall short of your expectation but if your about fast quick pick up n play multiplay, then a romp you will have.It creeps into the thumbs up for me but not by much as while the multiplay makes this worth a buy, the normal price tag makes me wince when i weigh it up pound for pound.( While i wont change my original review or that of the DLCs because i do want people to consider the point im making before purchasing just the base game only, i dont want people to think this is a bad game as its most certainly not).

												I AM RETRACTING EVERTHING I HAVE EVER SAID ABOUT THIS GAME, SO MANY BUGS AND ISSUESPositives -1. car racing and destruction is always fun and enjoyable2. customisation on all vehicles and unlocks and stickers and paint is good as well3. the locations and track are different and varied but not so much that it is a huge changeNegatives -1. the weapons do not do anything - 950 rounds from 2 miniguns into and enemy and the car is only at 50% damage even though you can get double damage it doesnt do anything. Shotguns are better and how?2. Ridiculous AI - i was 2 % off killing an enemy car and then he somehow went from 7th to 2nd on a straight in 3 seconds flat. - what?3. Your car does a full 180 degree spin when you hit a mine, or get stunned, or get hit once by a shotgun on straightThis game could be so good, but after the first hour or 2 you start to notice all the issues and bugs, and thats what is frustrating. Weak♥♥♥♥♥weapons, driving controls are tolerable but not great, unfair AI, wierd objectives. They did have a multiplayer but i guess they shut down due to lack of players. It may just be me that is having issues and bugs with this game but due to it being out for over 5 years i think they will always stay in the game - it was fun and enjoyable while it lasted. 6/10This has been my personal experience - if you don't like my review feel free to buy this game and play it for yourself. :)			",113,17,7,13,7,3,7

												This game brings me back to the days when I used to play Twisted Metal with mate after school, before mum called me home for dinner.  It's rediculous fun that you can lose yourself in for hours.  The graphics are very nice and the metal soundtrack is excellent.  I also picked up the DLC with this too, but I've only played the zombie one so far.  It took place in an arena and reminded me a lot of Carmageddon from back in the day.  Really good fun.Basically, what Im saying is, this game is one big nostalgia trip for me; one that I would highly recommend any one pick up and give a go, especially if you can find it on offer at all and are a fan of the genre.

Just go get flatout 2 instead.			",374,109,9,43,31,4,58
