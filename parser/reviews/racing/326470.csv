												Fun, although very repetitive, could have used varying backgrounds, mechanics, and level designs. Fun how you learn about the universe though. No real story. 7/10.			",452,80,11,25,16,6,21

												God damn radiation zones.The graphics aren't bad, the concept makes no sense, but it's a game, so it doesn't have too. It's a puzzle game about dragging planets through a course of hazards without touching the walls (which are deemed as radiation zones). The game's inertia mechanic drives me insane, though I'd imagine it adds to the challenge as to when to stop dragging and when to pull back (I'm just not particularly good at it). You'll have obstacles to drag your planet through, and turning and changing the direction of the planet is something you'll have to do carefully unless you're good at it. Judging from the trailer, further on in the game, different mechanics are introduced and add more challenge to the game. It does a have a neat little feature that shows you your previous runs in that level as you're doing it again, in real time. You can also watch someone else's playthrough in comparsion to your own via the leader boards. I only played the tutorial levels, but I realized the game wasn't for me. It seems like it'd be great for speed runners or people who like trying to get the ""best times"" in such games. If you enjoy these concepts, then give the game a bash.I'm not reccomending it based on my own tastes, but I could see why some people would enjoy it.			",3022,1209,118,323,420,38,485

												This is a very good game! For those who like Physics games, and those who like games that need quick reflexes, this combines the best of both worlds! Pretty much the point of the game is to get Earth to the goal, while navigating through space, by warping space. BUT, it's not that easy. There are objects which will slow you down, speed you up and many more. Good thing this game is filled with facts and is based on true facts, not made-up space stories. To see what the game is actually like when playing it, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1ccVsCdM0 ",95,25,4,9,6,2,9

												(I was going to do a video review of this, but then lost interest...)Space Warp is one of those games you play to fill time, usually while you are waiting for a bus, or already on a bus... let's just call it a ""bus game"".The premise is that the Earth has once again entered one of it's natural states in games, being in big trouble. Not an entirely new or original situation to be fair, but not one commonly done with this genre. Anyways, the Earth is in danger of being microwaved by space radiation and it is up to you to steer the Earth to safety by bending space and time in a 2D environment stricken with a kind of gellatinous radioactive jelly often found in the back of student dorm refridgerators, which kindly creates neat little passageways for your suddenly mobile Earth to steer through, in 2D, to the safe zone of each level... in 2D.If I seem hung up on the 2D aspect of this, it is for a good reason. Space is very infrequently represented well in 2D. Much in the same way I do not like 2D mining games, 2D space games need to have a LOT of fantastic gameplay to compensate for cutting out an entire dimension before I can begin to feel like I haven't been ripped off.Space Warp does not have fantastic gameplay. It is what you would expect from the marble-maze genre (yes I made that up). It does it's job but the theme chosen, while only slightly more original than ""get ball to hole"", having a space theme with no real 3D or more exciting gameplay cripples the game a bit for me. There is some tight programming in there, the graphics are nice, it all works well and feels good, but there isn't much more here to offer non-fans of similar, casual bus games. So all-in-all, not for me, but recommended to try it if you enjoy maze games or are stuck on a 12 hour bus journey.			",220,36,1,20,28,2,39

												Space Warp is a very fun and challenging arcade game. Essentially a puzzle game, you have to move the Earth through tight spaces, moving dead zones, and other traps. The game has online leaderboards and while each level is short, they keep you going since you want to get that better score.			",2533,1063,103,328,347,26,430

												Ah, would it be lovely to move your whole house when it gets too hot in summer, to just pick it up, literally and just move to a cooler climate. Just needs someone to invent a Trans-Warp Locator. Or when the neighbourhood gets real bad, just point your TWL, poof and there you have it, your house is no-where near Justin Bieber.Ok, in the mean time, while we wait for science to catch up with our reality, Mind Crew have taken upon themselves to find a way to move the whole Earth, just in case Mr Bieber decides to step out for a moment and if by coincidence, the Sun happens to go full Nova on us, at the same time.Space Warp is a maze runner game with a twist. The Sun is super heating the solar system and you need to move Earth out of danger, by warping space near our little blue marble, to manoeuvre it to a new system. Screw up and earth becomes a steaming hot Quarter Pounder (Would you like fries with that). The more you warp space in a certain direction, the faster Earth will move in that direction, need to slow down, simply warp space on the opposite side of the Earth. It’s that easy…. NOT!  Remember, you are moving around 5.972 × 10^21 tons of dirt with 7 Billon back seat drivers screaming at you to hit the brakes (all this going around and around, just gets so…..yesterday!!), so your not going to be stopping on a dime.  Instead you are going to be drifting the world around corners and through some pretty tight areas, the Swedish rally way, that even Per-Gunnar Andersson will give you a nod. And you need to do it in the fastest time possible. Slow and steady or like a banshee on steroids it’s up to you how fast you go, but your time is your make or break, especially seeing your time is on an updated leader board. Yep your get to see who you need to beat, like the real world rally, just, with the real world as your car. Also to help or hinder you along are solar winds which can blow you into walls, backwards or even speed you up. There are yellow areas which will slow or bog you down, so they are the sandpits of the cosmos. Walls that move or can even crush the world (bringing true the Flat Earth Society).Another great feature of this game is the ghost car….. I mean ghost earth. You can see how well you do against yourself or any of the other players by having a ghost to compare/compete with. You have a whole 60 levels spread across 8 zones to try or fry Earth to your hearts content.The graphics are good and clean, they get the job done. Options are also good and clean with the standard sound & music on/off, windowed or full screen but no other graphic options. Music is not too overbearing and suits the game. But like most Inde games, lacks variety so I recommend cranking up some Mega Death in the back ground.  The game play is good fun and Space Warp will be a great time waster, while you have a break from the nine to five grind. But beyond wanting to beat everyone’s time, there is not a lot of replay value.So until a TWL gets invented, I need to finish strapping some jet packs onto my house and get ready to fly south for the summer. Hmmm, South pole look good at this time of the year.Original review at https://cassus.org/muut/#!/puzzle for all you Inde discussion.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
