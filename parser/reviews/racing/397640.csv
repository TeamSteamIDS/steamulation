												It's decent.The graphics are nice and stylish and the music's okay. Gameplay is a bit lacking as there's not really too much depth to it, but for the price it's worth giving a go.			",32,5,1,1,4,1,4

												Fun graphics, cool music, and cheap price. Except the controls are terrible (and never explained, you have to figure them out), there are no options to change settings/key bindings/etc, and there is no multiplayer. Not to say it isn't entertaining: the challenge of battling the game's poor controls to try and get a good time is kinda fun. If you think $2 is worth an hour or so in a cheap racing game doing time trials, go for it. Otherwise, forget about Nulldrifters.			",62,6,1,3,14,0,2

												While this game lacks many important stuff (like 1080p resolution and a minimap), it's definitely not a bad game. The controls are great, the graphics are good looking and most of the tracks are pretty well designed. It's pretty fun too, it just feels a little bit unfinished. Oh, and it's pretty cheap.Yes, there are much better games at Steam, but this doesn't mean this game isn't worth getting.			",120,23,5,4,9,0,17

												I have a hard time hating on this game. It's got some definite flaws, but it's also clearly a labor of love. It's also got an oddness about it that I'm not sure what the origin is.The whole game feels like it was designed as homebrew for the GBA until very late in its development. From the windowed resolution that doesn't quite seem to be 16:9, to the low-res textures and skybox, to the ripped-straight-from-F-ZERO:MaximumVelocity camera angle and mostly-flat tracks, to the super-low-rez menu and UI elements. Sure, a lot of this might be a stylistic choice, but I'm pretty sure everything in this game outside of the render output resolution and track polycount would have been more than possible on the GBA.Even all that aside, it's a very flat game. GBA racers (such as the aforementioned F-Zero: Maximum Velocity) were frequently steeped in depth. They often had interesting physics, lots of customization, a multitude of tracks, and were portable. Nulldrifters has 16 tracks, the most 'workable' physics I've seen in a racer in a long time, and I'm pretty sure the eight ships (of which four ar locked) are all functionally identical.That said, it's not a bad little game. It's got decent music, with one or two standout tracks, and most of the maps are decent. Though there are four that are designed to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off with blind corners leading into narrow sections with no walls, so there's that. If this game was GBA homebrew, it would be pretty impressive. But as a PC release, it's pretty underwhelming.It's probably not worth $2 USD, but for the $0.50 I got it for, I had a decently fun time. Pick it up on sale if you're looking for something a little different, just don't expect a lot of depth.			",211,53,13,24,50,2,16
