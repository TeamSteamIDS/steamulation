												Put a quarter into the arcade machine and play this one. Ignore the cheesy chip tune (or turn it off in the options), ignore the shooter game it starts with, because in a sudden twist you'll find yourself in a platformer with a teleport gun that handles arcade style: no blue and orange portals, just straight up teleports and precision jumps that let you reach where you want to reach, provided you can figure out and make the jumps.Don't pass this one by while it's on sale.

												Ok, let's be honest: I bought this game for 0,19€ and thought it would be 'okay' for a couple of minutes, I'd grab the cards and then it would disappear in the library, never to be looked at again. After the first 20 minutes I had to admit that the game is quite entertaining and after seeing the ending I didn't even notice that I've played it for over an hour. Sure the (retro-style) pixel graphics and the 16-bit sound seem to be standard for every second indie game, but in 'Out There Somewhere' they do their job quite good, they made me feel a bit nostalgic and are very charming (I really like this music in the main menu). The portal gun and the different puzzles are well done and I seriously had to think sometimes how to solve this room. Green, red and blue light beams, jumping, momentum - there are several things to consider when shooting that little bullet. Yeah it is a short game with a short 'story' (the bad guy shoots at me, my ship crashes and I have to explore the planet to finally kill the bad guy. All of this because of... reasons!) and a length of approximately one hour for the first playthrough. However during this short period I've been entertained well and it never felt repetitive. In addition there are many interesting achievements that bring in some replay value, so I'd say it's definitly worth this small price and I have to admit: Developers, you've done a really nice job!

												Let me start by saying that I bought this with 96% discount for 19c. The title grabbed my attention, and so I just had to try it. What else could I buy for 19 cents anyway? I can't think of many other things, and certainly not something that could keep me entertained for several hours like this little gem did.What is it about?Out there somewhere is a short 2D puzzle-platformer with a few simple but interesting mechanics. For me personally, it feels like a mash-up of Portal, The Swapper and You Have to Win the Game, which is a good thing because I like all of those games.You take a role of Yuri - the space cop, who tries to protect the mothership from a bad guy Grigori. Your ship was shot down and crashed on an unknown planet. Now you have to find missing parts, repair your shuttle and face Gregori once again…GameplayAlthough the very first segment of the game is a classic arcade-machine-style space shooter, don't be fooled. The whole gameplay is based on jumping around with teleportation gun, solving puzzles. How it works is, you fire ""teleshots"" and you are instantly teleported the moment they hit the surface. Your telegun also stores your momentum, which is another important little mechanic to keep in mind. There are obviously different surfaces, obstacles and problems throughout the levels, and it's all up to you to solve.Later in game, you'll get a pew pew gun to deal with enemies if you so desire, but you can very well just avoid most of them...SidenotesPuzzles are challenging but fun. There are plenty of checkpoints, so even if you die, it's not a major setback most of the time.Even though the visual style is simple, I really dig the concept art and the cutscenes, as well as chiptune soundtrack - it's surprisingly not as monotonous and annoying as I thought it would be. I think it all works well with the space theme, too. Not to forget, there are even some funny little easter eggs and references here and there, and I'm always a big fan of those.Like I mentioned before, this game is short. Even taking it reaaally slow and casual, it took me only 3 hours to beat. You could very possibly manage to do your first playthrough in 90 minutes. There's even achievement for finishing the game in under 20 minutes… There's some replayability thanks to Steam achievements, but even then, you shouldn't expect endless hours of fun. On the other hand - it's a very simple game in terms of game mechanics, and it could get boring and repetitive if it took too long. I guess it depends on how you look at it. I would say it's reasonable for what it is.ConclusionWhat can I say, it's a nice little game. It requires thinking and quick reactions, and thanks to that, it can be pretty challenging. It's a kind of one-trick-pony, but well executed IMHO. I know some people might feel it's too short for the full price, but I definitely do recommend it when it's in sale.			",235,79,4,14,16,1,17

												Out There Somewhere is an aesthetically pleasing puzzle platformer that makes use of teleporting and various environmental obstacles. The art and gameplay are both well done, and it is a nice treat. The mechanics of the game are easy to pick up and there is an even balance between execution and solution in the puzzles (in other words, it takes some thinking as well as fast fingers). Not to be confused with a portal gun (where you make two doors and enter freely), when you fire your telegun you are teleported when your projectile hits a solid surface. There are obstacles (crumbling surfaces, mirrors, glass, some beams, and enemies) that are thrown into the mix to keep things interesting. The controls all feel solid, and, given the length, the game was fair in challenge and pacing.There is very little combat (most enemies can be avoided) and there are 3 boss fights (1 being a repeat). That being said, unless you get health upgrades, there can be some challenge in avoiding everything or killing everything. The main game is rather short if you are focused on just beating the game (my first run with very little exploration clocked in just over an hour), however I highly recommend you take the time to explore and find all the upgrades: these areas are some of the more challenging of the game. The story and dialogue feel underdeveloped, and overall I was left wanting more of the game in general, but I do not consider this a bad thing.Out There Somewhere is light on combat and easy on your backlog, but those looking for a clever puzzle platformer should check it out.

 About Out There Somewhere Game starts off as a shoot'em up side-scroller, which really took me by surprise. I mean, judging by the screens you'd rather expect a puzzle platformer and you get that not so long after the game starts, too. And then it just hit me, the brilliance of the idea: you fly, fighting your way to a new planet. Then you land, 'meet the locals' and proceed with the featured mission, which involves solving puzzles, fighting your way forward and doing some cool oldschool platformer type trickjumps. It's just all there. Again, really awesome mix. Gameplay	The puzzle part is rather fun, the puzzles are not terribly easy, but also not too complicated. Can't imagine spending 8 minutes trying to beat one though (one of the achievements). As the game progresses, different beams are implemented, which change the behaviour of your teleport gun. The variety of enemies is rather limited - 4 kinds, erasing them is a bit of a chore, spam your gun until they drop dead. The game could feature no enemies and no one would probably miss them. The NPCs remind me the ones in old NES games, like Duck Tales, sometimes you have to sweat a little to get to them, but they might have some useful information or will say some funny things.The shoot'em up part is just there I guess. It covers approx. 5% of a game that lasts for an hour, so you don't really spend too much time in it, shame.Graphic	It's mostly just your basic 'oldschool-nes-like-game-graphics'. Anyway, the art style is pleasant to watch. The only thing that somehow buggered me was that some maps looked a bit mundane and dull, with only same bricks of terrain laid over another same bricks of terrain. Adding more background details and decorations would probably make the game look a bit nicer, but then again, it's not really about the graphics this time, is it?All in All Out There Somewhere is a really good Indie Game!8/10 From MeSweep 	 ",122,14,2,7,7,0,7

Product received for free
Basic InformationTitle:  Out There SomewhereDeveloper:  MiniBossPublisher:  EQ-Games, MiniBossGenre:  Classic style platformerGeneral ImpressionOut There Somewhere is a 2D platformer that emulates the classic side-scrolling action of older titles while offering a breath of fresh air in the almost entire absence of platforming sections.  The story is all about a stranded astronaut trying to survive. Quite odd for a platformer is the lack of many enemies as well. You will mostly teleport here and there with ocassional text based dialogue pop-ups. This is definitely more an experience about exploration than combat and avoiding obstacles. Even if the game is rather short it felt a bit boring at times. It features simple graphics and sounds but for its price point and considering the inclusion of Cards and Achievements, the game is ultimately worth trying out.Strong Points+ Plenty of collectibles.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points-  Unbalanced difficulty.- Too short.Rating 6/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews and Cubbes.

												I've never seen this mechanic before, it's very fun and gives some interesting puzzle platforming. And it is well explored in the level design. I love the visuals too. Quality pixel art, very cute. The game is mostly on the easy side. I figured out the mechanics quickly and at worst I died 3 to 4 times on the hardest rooms. The bullet hell sections, however, are pretty hard! at least to me, I hate bullethell games. It is a very small part of the game, but it makes me wonder about mixing such completely different genres. Here it didn't take anything from the game but I remember feeling quite disappointed with Brutal Legends, for example, because I went in expecting to play an action fighting game in an open world and found myself playing an RTS. I don't like RTS so I couldn't enjoy the game, no matter how good it is. But I digress. This is not an issue with Out There Somewhere, the spaceship sessions are short and few.It's extremely short though. But without considering price, length is not a very useful information. What I mean by that is I think the game is worth what they are asking for it. It's a short adorable, original and fun little game and it's cheaper than a sandwich. I'm a very satisfied custommer.

												Out There Somewhere is a nice platformer where you initially drive a spaceship, then you explore a planet full of weird aliens, and finally you get into your spaceship again for the final confrontation.You can beat the game in well under two hours, and as far as I can tell there is not much replay value (unless you want to collect the several achievements that Steam lets you collect). I recommend this game as long as you buy it at a discount, since it's a very short game. However, it is well done, it sometimes requires some reasoning to travel through certain screens, there are several secret screens and collectables thrughout the game, and its aesthetics is overall nice.Plus: it's chocked full of sci-fi (mostly Star Trek, but not only that) references, which is always good!

Note: video review embedded below.There’s something untraditionally appealing about Out There Somewhere’s insubstantiality. It’s a very brief, straightforward experience, but rather than feeling shallow it uses its brevity to subvert the players expectations in interesting ways.That arcade shooting segment at the start? That’s just a prelude to the platformer that takes up most of the game. That gun you’re carrying? It’s actually for teleporting you around instead of killing enemies. The huge world the game seems to be hinting at? In reality it’s a more classical one direction platformer. Out There Somewhere is full of little touches that seemed designed to throw you off course and surprise you with how things play out. They may come at the cost of making a lasting impression, but I feel like that wasn’t ever its prerogative.Out There Somewhere also gets away with a lot more than most games could because of how strong its mechanics are, and how intrinsically they’re tied to level designs. The teleporter gun is largely your only tool throughout the game, and each screen is made to perfectly utilize it for platforming and puzzle solving (provided your reflexes are up for it). Eventually I was having to take into account bullet speed, character momentum, and environmental devices in order to navigate effectively. These additions are added quickly, but also scale the difficulty smoothly enough to where I almost didn’t realize how much more involved later levels were because the game had taught me how to play so well.One could argue that Out There Somewhere is too short or simple or loose, and they wouldn’t be entirely wrong. The game often feels as if it’s holding on by a thread and some frustrating moments can be a lot more unpleasant due to how much of the overall game they encompass. But its length and careful scope feel so intentional and considered that I was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt and enjoy how it played with my expectations. I might not remember it a year or even a month from now, but as a condensed experiment in teleportation and unconventional design I don’t regret the journey.

Short story, unusal game mechanics, pretty good soundtrack. But I don't know, there is something wrong with jumping... Sometimes you just can't jump again after using a teleporter and it's really annoying. Actually this game is about teleporting and reaching new grounds. ",1345,477,58,113,133,12,173

												Out there somewhere is a nice platformer with a decent ""old-school"" feel -- it's not a strained and missed attempt to cash in on nostalgia for ""retro"" games; quite the opposite it feels and looks solid like all the parts belong where they are. The platforming can be pretty challenging at times due to the addition of a teleport gun gimmick that teleports the character to wherever the bullet lands. Add in conservation of momentum across teleports, ability to shoot multiple tele-bullets at a time, and special beams of light and you get some neat platforming! Akin to old platformers the game world has its share of secret rooms and hidden bonuses that await the daring explorer. Also monsters and other baddies, a big bad boss, and two space shmup sections! Overall a pretty short experience -- around 1 hour for a casual experience, or under 20 mins for a speed run -- but between the secrets and a speedrunning challenge there's enough to warrant an extra play or two.

												I have to say, this may verry well be the best $.49 I have ever spentPros-Amazing teleport mechanic-Good difficulty curve-Great Music-Treeman-Overall gameplay is greatCons-It's short-Bats-somewhat annoying combat systemBartle TaxonomyKillers: Not the best game for these guys. You only get one gun, and it's not that powerfull. Not the best game for this type of player.Achievers: Many achivements and ingame collectables to get. A great game for this type of player.Socialisers: There is some interaction with aliens, but not a whole lot. Most aliens only have one line. There won't be much of any replay value for this type of player, but for the first time through it will be decent.Explorers: Explorers should have a great time with this game. When playing through it, I often saw places I couldn't reach from my current position and thought ""How can I get over there?"" There are many hidden places to find. This type of player will have a great time with this game.Score:7/10Make the combat less annoying, have more interaction with aliens, and make the game a bit longer. These are the only complaints I have about this game. However, for it's price, I highly recomend this game.			",33,2,0,4,4,0,1

												A nice little game, I got a copy early but never actually got around to playing it so I figured I'd do that now.What is it?Well it's basically a semi-portal metroidvania. You have a teleport gun that moves you to where it shoots, with it carrying over momentum so when you jump it keeps your speed. That being the core mechanic of the game it does it very well. You have to utilise you teleport gun along with various world objects to get around.Is it something I like? No, it's really not my style of game.Is it something I'd recommend? Definitely, it is a very solid platformer with an emphasis on timing. Don't let the chep price fool you, it's certainly worth a lot more than they are charging.			",394,88,7,40,29,3,33

												A fun, charming and creative puzzle platformer. It pushes the creativity of its teleporting mechanic very far. Only lasted about an hour but it was really enjoyable.This game is a bit challenging and forces you to think about what you're doing. One thing I loved was that failing a level didn't have a lengthy game over screen, or a splash. It would throw you right back in which kept the action up. And even if was only 3 or 4 enemies I also liked that the game had some combat. I'd love to see the idea expanded. I think there's a lot of hidden depth in the teleporting mechanic that the developers didn't exploit this time around. This is a  great game that's worth a try.			",174,24,3,21,7,1,13

												I bought this game in one of those infamous 19¢ sales at some point in the distant past, never actually thinking I would play it.  Then one day I fired it up, saw it was a terrible side-scrolling space shooter, and uninstalled it.Except...that is a fake-out, as anyone who has played for more than a few minutes knows, and once that is finished you get to play through a brisk but still roundly enjoyable (and adorable) kind of simple platformer-meets-Portal.  Well, teleporting, not portals, but it certainly calls that to mind.The pixel art is gorgeous, the soundtrack matches perfectly, and it will probably make you feel smart when you figure out some of the trickier puzzles.  Totally worth 19¢.  I daresay I would pay upwards of DOLLARS for it!			",293,77,2,52,17,2,13

The game mechanics are great and easy to learn. The puzzles make you think, but aren't insanely difficult, which is great for a casual playthrough. Especially when it's 1am and you really should be going to bed because you've got course in the morning but it's just too damn good to stop playing!

												After beating the game several times, I gotta say I feel bad I got this when it was on -96% sale.This was a surpisingly good indie game to me. I didn't know what to expect before installing it but since I saw from some other reviews that the game was short I decided to give it a chance. I'm glad I did.The game is a conventional 2D exploration platformer for the asthetics, but combines it with some Portal mechanics and specially with the Cave Story gameplay style. The game takes place into an uncharted dark world that together with the main character look-a-like give that final Limbo taste. So actually the devs' description about the game is accurate enough.You accidentally land into this planet so the goal is basically finding a way to repair it and get rid of the people who chased you. A very soft story but heh, aside from Ori and the Blind Forest, no one expects a deep storymode from a 2D platformer, do they?Graphics are cute and satisfying to my eyes. Even though the world is constantly dark, you feel pretty immersed in it soon enough. Also, the few places where the story take place are quite varied so you don't feel you're just stepping into the same thing over and over. Music is surprisingly catchy. I've always liked chiptune/8bit/16bit music and this game catches the point. Damn, this game is worthy just for that, guys!Gameplay is perfect as usual in 2D platformers. Tight and fair, every death will be at your own fault. The physics of the portal gun, the jumps, the movement and those devices that works with the gun respond as they should.As an exploration game, the game is rewarding. I didn't care to play this game 4 times, and between them I just discovered new things, which was charming considering how short the game is. The map is pretty well developed and I can only critisize the fact that to get full map exploration you need to avoid some checkpoints until you get the laser gun so you can die and restart from start point with it.Puzzles are fair and not frustrating. I'm usually super derp with these games since I usually think answers too much and never reach the end, uninstalling the game eventually. But this one felt the right way. Puzzles were easy enough for me, but still give you that feeling of ""Oh! Now I see it"". Overall, I'm happy I made priority with this game over many from my library. Even at full price, the game will give you entertainment and joy. Devs certainly deserved more than 19 cts!Final Mark: 7.5/10			",306,68,8,26,7,2,10

												TL;DR - I know my play time looks insane. You will assuredly not get 190 hours of this game, but you will get 2 of the most fun hours you've had gaming in a while. Buy now!As my first foray into speedrunning, this game has given me several dozen hours of entertainment beyond what would be expected by reasonable gamers. But I am trying to be unbiased, and think of this game from a casual standpoint.I still recommend it glowingly.A quirky 2D platformer with a laser-sharp, utilitarian design approach, Out There Somewhere gives you a light dash of shooting combat, a gentle hint of exploration, and a core game built around puzzle-platforming with a 2D teleport gun. It is bookended by space shooter segments that some reviewers have taken issue with - I won't argue with them for finding these segments disjunct, but I still enjoy them anyway.It is worth noting that the pace at which new mechanics are introduced is absolutely stellar - far better than many A-list titles. You get a sense for what each button does, a scenario or two that changes your approach, and then a wholly new element just as you are getting comfortable.It seems like the biggest complaint from most reviewers is the game's short length. Most people should have an easy time earning the ""Swift Success"" achievement on their first play, it's true, but the collectibles should keep completionists occupied for another hour or so after - they even require a little meta-gaming! At a two dollar price point, this is plenty of game for your buck, and it's not often that this caliber of level design, soundtrack, and art style find their way into a two-dollar title.

												This is a competent retro 8-bit platformer. But wait! What makes this particular game interesting is the teleport gun: you fire the gun, and you teleport to the point of impact. The developer makes good use of this fact for a variety of puzzles, spiced up by the fact momentum is maintained through the teleport, plus vertical light beams that have different effects on your projectile. There's also a more traditional gun, although to be honest the combat never really felt necessary, apart from a couple of puzzles. It's not that difficult to figure out a way through each room, and in fact there are occasionally different ways of doing so; the difficulty lies in the execution, but thankfully it's not that frustrating.It doesn't last very long, 90 minutes at the most, but I paid $0.19 or something so I'm hardly likely to complain. Nice traditional chiptune music, appealing 8-bit graphics, some secrets to find, and even a space shooter minigame, overall it's worthwhile if you like a bit of puzzling in your 8-bit platforming.

												Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ When I initially saw this game on the store for 25 cents I wasn't sure if a game this cheap would be worth it. However upon downloading and booting up this game I was instantly met with waves of energy and joy. From when I hit ""new game"" I knew I was in for a ride, and what a ride that was. The music controlled the gameplay almost more than I did, forcing me in and out of situations that would seem impossible with the very sound of a note. The ""portal gun"", as one could call it, adds a new depth to the platforming which makes it fun, puzzling, and at some points infuriating. Out There Somewhere is like nothing I have played before, or as I should say, many things I have played before. The developers took Cave Story, Portal, Metroid, and VVVVVV and spat out one of the best indie games I have played in the past few years. I recommend this game to everyone who loves difficulty (while still beign fair), a simple yet entertaining narrative, and just some sweet bumpin' tunes. So what do you have to lose? With a full price of 4.99 and a sale orice of 0.25 (canadian), this game is a steal. I give it a solid 9.5/10			",49,12,0,2,5,0,1

												Low-res puzzle platformers are almost literally a dime a dozen now but Out There Somewhere manages to stand apart by being polished and clever with its core mechanic. That mechanic is a teleport gun, which fires a bullet that teleports you to its point of impact. The teleport preserves your momentum as well, so if you start a jump right before you warp, you can essentially tele-walljump. Several puzzles make use of this and other neat physics tricks you can do with yourself, gradually nudging the difficulty up in a pleasant, inviting way that has you feeling clever and masterful by the end of the game. There's a little combat with enemies and a few secrets to hunt if you are so inclined, but it's a very short and sweet package... one playthrough will last you less than an hour. I certainly wish it was longer because it is very tight and fun for those 45 minutes, but what's there is more than worth playing. There's even some inklings of plot and some interaction with aliens as you traverse the odd little world, and neat opening and closing sequences that play like Gradius-style shooters. And if you really feel like sticking with it, there are a mess of oddly-grindy achievements to shoot for, though I wouldn't encourage it. Overall a great little experience for even the most jaded puzzle platformer player.			",488,212,8,71,62,7,65

												Although the story is not something that will take hours to go through, this game is worth the price. It is a kind of game that you will replay—it has achievements that you likely cannot get in just a few playthroughs. There are hidden easter eggs to be found as well. The soundtrack is fun and the graphics are rather nice too. I've played through the story once and know I will several more times as well, for I still have things to find and achievements to get. This is a pretty good platformer + puzzle game.			",17,8,0,4,8,1,2

												SPOILERS AHEAD! In a sense this is actually 2 games, so I will talk about them separately. The shmup section was short but sweet, I am terrible at these kinds of games but I enjoyed it. My only issue is that your gun won't fire at full speed if you hold down the button, requiring you to mash for the most damage potential. I died as soon as the boss shot his laser, and though I'd need to restart until...The puzzle-platforming section, which is the meat of the game. Crashing on the planet and needing to find ship parts (conveniently the same model as the shmup upgrades) reminded me of Knytt (in a good way), and so did the slower pace and early lack of combat. Puzzle progress felt steady and fun, though the ""double shot"" puzzle I managed to solve without learning the proper trick, stunting my progress in the next few rooms. I really enjoyed having a ""teleport"" gun instead of a ""portal"" gun, which felt very fresh as a mechanic. Combat was passable, with notable frustration trying to hit the flying bats, and not knowing how long the boss would take to defeat. The biggest issue I had was with NPC conversations, ending the conversation would not close the text box right away and another press would start it again; extremely frustrating.Going back to shmup at the end was unexpected and exciting, and I didn't die to the laser! I was a bit sad that it ended, but that title call-out was a great wrap up to the story. The art and sound were excellent throughout, with a special mention to alien NPC designs.

												Short, but enjoyable.I beat ""Somewhere Out There"" in about an hours time, but by no means to completion. Despite this, I whole heartedly recommend this game. It's a clever little puzzle platformer that harkens back to some of the classics in the genre. The story, while short, is interesting and the music is memorable and entertaining to listen to.My only real beef is with the very plain graphics. The character sprites and the portraits are so nice, I wish that the backgrounds had some of the same attention given to them. The game just looks plain. Take a look at a game like Rex Rocket for an example of how beautiful a game like this can be. Fortunately, ""Out There Somewhere"" is saved by it's fantastic platforming, which is really all that matters anyway.			",1124,697,26,123,103,11,149

(jesus I love them but i hate them at the same time......)- Too short, way too short..- What makes the game take long are the puzzles and the time you get stuck in them but if you are quick to do them it's too short.- Space battle is just 1/5 of the game, it could have more space battle in order to make the game a bit longer as wellOverall:Fun game, good art, good music, good mechanics. All in all I recommend it's a fun game to pass some time tho it is a bit short it is still fun and still worth the money.Score:8/10			",185,67,5,33,14,2,22

												Definitely feels like cave story so far - looks good,. worth 19 cents even without the trading cards. Possibly more. Worth getting while the special promotion is up and running,.Too early for me to tell if the whole game is worth 5$ or more, but it's looking good so far.edit1: A bit further into the game, it will get harder, but not by so much that you'll bash your head on the keyboard. Some of the puzzles can even be ""cheated"" by completing them with a bit of clever jumping to avoid the way they were ""intended to be solved"".Some reviews will claim it's about 90 minutes worth of gameplay,. and at the speed that these puzzles are getting solved I'd say that seems about right. Still 19 cents for an hour of something new is good,. but I wouldn't pay 5$ for it. So, get it while it's on discount, or in the next humble bundle.			",616,194,15,71,48,8,69

Warning: May Contains SpoilersTwo words: wasted potential!I have just finished playing Out There Somewhere and it was a really pleasant experience. However, it was a very SHORT experience indeed.Anyway, let me break it down to details and grade every aspect on its own.ConceptGame starts off as a shoot'em up side-scroller, which really took me by surprise. I mean, judging by the screens you'd rather expect a puzzle platformer and you get that not so long after the game starts, too. And then it just hit me, the brilliance of the idea: you fly, fighting your way to a new planet. Then you land, 'meet the locals' and proceed with the featured mission, which involves solving puzzles, fighting your way forward and doing some cool oldschool platformer type trickjumps. It's just all there. Again, really awesome mix.StoryNot much to say really. No history, no explanations, no nothing. Just fix your ship and welp, you're done. I mean, I didn't really expect to have a Witcher 3 in space, but for the sake of having the player become involved in the game, it really needs something. Tell me a story of a war, rebellion maybe, invasion, whatever, but please share some details with us, not just generic 'Humanity almost extinct, Grigori attacks, protect planet' stuff. I wouldn't even need any cut scenes, just some text scrolling up with a nice background, skippable for those who don't care about such aspects of the game.GraphicsIt's mostly just your basic 'oldschool-nes-like-game-graphics'. Anyway, the art style is pleasant to watch. The only thing that somehow buggered me was that some maps looked a bit mundane and dull, with only same bricks of terrain laid over another same bricks of terrain. Adding more background details and decorations would probably make the game look a bit nicer, but then again, it's not really about the graphics this time, is it?MusicSimple, yet quite atmospheric. It reminds me of the soundtrack of Risk of Rain that is electronic sounds that just really fit the space exploration theme of the game. The musical themes change when you change a map/biome and pretty much all of them are really enjoyable.GameplayThe puzzle part is rather fun, the puzzles are not terribly easy, but also not too complicated. Can't imagine spending 8 minutes trying to beat one though (one of the achievements). As the game progresses, different beams are implemented, which change the behaviour of your teleport gun. The variety of enemies is rather limited - 4 kinds, erasing them is a bit of a chore, spam your gun until they drop dead. The game could feature no enemies and no one would probably miss them. The NPCs remind me the ones in old NES games, like Duck Tales, sometimes you have to sweat a little to get to them, but they might have some useful information or will say some funny things.The shoot'em up part is just there I guess. It covers approx. 5% of a game that lasts for an hour, so you don't really spend too much time in it, shame.ContentI've got only one thing to say about the content - More!. The game needs more planets, more story depth, more types of guns, more types of enemies, more collectibles, more puzzles, more bosses, more flying in space, more technical upgrades to your ship, more play time, more replayability, just literally, more of everything. Honestly, give this game a 10h playthrough time which implements new mechanisms, enemies and bosses gradually, add a decent story, raise the price accordingly and you have a really decent game!To compare, playing this game right now is like getting a new toy, figuring out how it works and suddenly, someone snaps it out of our hands. It just leaves hunger for moreOverallTo sum up, for the price you're going to get this, which is usually less than 1$, this game is totally worth it. But be warned, it literally has an hour of gameplay (exactly 53 minutes on my save file). I really hope that if the next part ever comes, it's going to have a significantly larger budget, which will allow creating a more in-depth experience with some solid (re)play value of at least 10+ hours.

												Out There Somewhere is a 2D platformer with simple puzzle elements. Your mission is take out Grigor, but in the battle your ship was damaged and you crash land on an unknown planet. You have to find him on the planet and take him out for good. This is mostly done by platforming. The main mechanic to get used to is the use of a portal gun. You shoot it and when the projectile hits a solid target you will be teleported to that spot. You'll learn the ins and outs of how that works, along with interacting with different beams and other obstacles that will change the way your teleportation works. There's also a gun you can use as a weapon to fight off the planet's hostile inhabitants. This gun doesn't shoot very rapidly and it's a small bullet, but this only makes it all the more useful as you need to aim carefully and plan your shots. It's simple to grasp but will test your smarts and skills as you try to get the hidden upgrades. The graphics are pixelated and dark. The visuals, along with some cool synth music, make for a nice atmosphere to travel through. There's not a whole lot more to say. Not much story, just some simple mechanics and areas to clear. It's a nice little game.There are some problems, though. All of them seem to stem from the game's legnth. It'll probably only take you 1-2 hours to beat it, and not much more for achievement hunters. That's fine story-wise, as there's not much there outside the premise. However, it seems like more could've been done with the mechanics that were set in place. More puzzles, more ideas with the mechanics, and just some more outside the box thinking. Having a longer game would also mean a larger world, with perhaps more items and powerups to collect. More bosses would've been good. There are two space shooting sections, but having more would've been nice as well. It's neat that those sections start and end the game to kind of tie it up in a nice little bow, but having more of them might make the playstyle feel a little more welcome. A map would've been nice too.Overall, this is a lighter recommendation. The game is nice with simple mechanics and intresting atmosphere, but it's rather short and could use some fleshing out. Perhaps there will be another game by the developers in a similar fashion, or maybe even a sequel to expand upon these ideas, which have a lot of potential. What's here is good, and only taking a while to beat isn't bad, but this game FEELS short. It feels like this style of game should have more to it. It's no Super Metroid, it's no Cave Story, but it's something neat that, if on sale, if worth checking out. Five dollars is a little steep for a Steam game like this, but if you can get it for a few bucks or less, consider it. Out There Somewhere gets a 6 out of 10 for being a neat little adventure that has lots of potential and a satisfying, even if short, experience.			",222,48,1,22,12,3,19

												Very short little game that has a few nice ideas and an overall good quality (if you are not already fed up with pixel art and chiptunes). It could have been longer and more generous (the end is kind of abrupt) but I feel that it would have overstayed its welcome given that it has not the scope of a true metroidvania.Anyway, it offers a good couple of hours of puzzle/platforming with a sensible difficulty curve. Thus, with the original price tag, I truly recommend waiting for sales.			",293,200,1,44,28,1,29

Product received for free
-Quick Review-Out There Somewhere is a 2d puzzle platformer with a hint of old arcade-space-shooting at the start and end, making the nice sandwich, which is ""Out There Somewhere"", developed by MiniBoss and released Mar 14, 2016.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: You play as the Protagonist: Small-pixel-man-with-goldfish-bowl-on-head. Goldfish bowl head starts out by flying a ship trying to shoot down space-captain-who's-his-face. (Can you tell none of the names stuck with me?) While the story and plot are pretty forgettable the game controls aren't in the slightest.

Gameplay: The basic controls are straight forward, you move right and left, jump and fire a portal gun, later you unlock a regular gun you can use to kill the various hostile NPC's. The controls work, I have been guilty of mixing up my two fire keybindings, which has resulted in death-by-NPC-face-hugging, or teleportation-into-pits-of-death (For clearification sake, your teleportation gun fires THROUGH NPC's hostile and friendly.), the controls weren't so bad for me, but the game really seems like it was designed more so with a controller in mind.But I'm getting ahead of myself, you start with just a Teleportation Gun, you fire a shot and when it connects with the wall, you teleport to the location of the laser/bullet. You actually have a few tricks you can pull off with the Teleportation gun early on, but don't learn about later in the game, so there is some skill that is developed with the Teleportation gun, rather then fire and teleport.

So once you finish playing the game, and if you start a new game you realize there are many hidden spots in the game that you originally had no idea where there. So that hints at the amount of time it takes to finish the game: it's a pretty short game, think an hour or two on average (Naturally the time to beat the game after your first, will rapidly decrease unless you're trying to find new locations and secrets).While I personally didn't find any of the puzzles too overwhelming, there's definitely plenty of difficulty to keep you mumbling obscenities under your breath as you get murdered again and again. While there's definitely more to the game, and plenty of content to keep you coming back, that's about all there is to say for the gameplay.Conclusion: As a whole, I enjoyed playing this game. This was one of the games I downloaded and played on my laptop while I was on a short little vacation away from my normal habitat. For using on lower powered computers I highly recommend this game, but when it comes to powered up computers that are normally playing MMORPG's or triple A titles... Out There Somewhere is still a pretty good diversion of a game. Pick it up on sale, play for a couple hours, go back to playing something else.

												This is a great little game! Very short (I beat it in under 1 hour), but it was very enjoyable, while it lasted.The visuals are nice, and so is the music. Nothing new in these 2 aspects, but they're faithful to the games that inspired this game and they're well done!The game has one main mechanic, and then some variations that support it. The mechanic is simply a teleport gun. You shoot a pellet that teleports you to it when it hits a wall. That's it. Despite its simplicity, though, it changes movement just enough to be ""surprising"", in some way, reaching escape velocity from ""generic platformer"".The level design is pretty good, always pushing you to use what you've learned about the teleport movement, instead of presenting normal platforms. There are also details spread throughout the game for speedrunners, which gives it another layer for those interested.The one complaint I have is that it is too easy, for the most part. There are hidden health-ups and armor for your ship, but these are mostly inconsequential to the game, so they're there for the extra challenge. Which is ok! The problem is that the game locks you out very often. You cross a certain section, and then you can't go back. This is a bit annoying, since the upgrades seen in one screen may require you to go around from another screen to get. So you may keep pushing forward, looking for the path, and then realize you can't go back... oops.Since the game is 1 hour long, this is not really a problem? But it's not optimal either, I would have prefered the other way.Anyway. Not much more to be said. It's not groundbreaking, but it's a very enjoyable title if you're looking for something quick, but still good!			",472,130,11,42,29,3,57

												This game is amazing. i love it.addicting and interestingsadly though, the keyboard controls let it down. They are trippy and confusing. usually you can click the wrong one an die. these controlls are so annoying you will fail the final boss fight so many times.The controls do this game an injustice. It would be a ton better if they added the capability to make your own controls and actually make a instructions section!Otherwise, by far, one of my most favourite steam games.BUY IT!great story and great soundtrackAND DEVS, ADD CUSTOM CONTROLLS!

												not only you get a good game for 1.99$ but also get a second free key for a game called Polarity that cost 10.99 $ ( has cards too) tone of respect to the devs- simple and short plot , you need to kill the bad guy in a space battle but you en up in an unknown planet and you have to repair you space ship and defeat him once again, took me 1h to finish it but if you're fast enough you can finish it under 20 min.-cute 2D art/8 -bit graphics style, very beautiful and well made ( bring good memories of the old days )-smooth gameplay , easy and fast to learn how the game works but require a bit of skills and speed to solve the puzzles ( there's walkthrough on youtube if you're stuck in a lvl ) . you have a gun to teleport ( portal style ) and a gun to kill monsters .-no voice acting ( 8 bit style so it's understandable), great sound tracks ( also 8 bit style)- most of the achievements are easy to get ( can be done in the first playthrough) but the others need some skills ( check youtube and steam community for help )- steam trading cards + other cards that you get from the second free game- no bugs or glitches and can be played with a keyboard or any controlleri highly recommend this game for those who love cute old style challenging platform games , worth the money ( 0.25$on sales) and you get a free game with it so go for it9/10			",636,174,27,75,40,8,63

												TL:DR, this game is great for its price. Granted, you'll only get ~5 hours of enjoyment from this but it is still pretty fun.The gameplay is very unique. I haven't seen anything like that in any other game I've played. It got me thinking really hard in the middle (though in the end, it got pretty easy to figure out.The story left quite a bit to be desired, with little to nothing explained about the characters. I leaned more about the main character from watching the trailer posted here than I did playing the game.The game itself felt... incomplete for lack of a better term. Right when I was having fun solving all the puzzles and finally getting the hang of it, the game cut to credits.While the game is short, you have to keep in mind that it is $2. It was a very fun and unique experience to me. I really hope the developers go farther with the gameplay ideas in future projects.			",37,2,0,3,1,0,0

												For a game I paid about $0.20 USD for, I got 75 minutes or so of fairly straightforward puzzle-platformer-with-teleport-gun gameplay.  Nothing stood out as exceptional but nothing was lackluster either, which is a plus really considering the price and what someone might expect from the saturated indie platformed genre.  I didnt feel like my time was wasted and I had some fun with it.  I dont particularly like chiptune / bit-aesthetic music. but it was pretty catchy and pleasant to listen to.  The NPC character sprites were also pretty well animated which is a good touch as well.Some players I see complaining about the control scheme.  I could see it as a problem for some, but I'm used to a few similar games so I handled it pretty well.  I didn't test a controller but with the Steam Controller API I don't think it should be much of a problem if you want a custom mapping.All in all, it was good!			",278,108,4,59,8,3,22

												Out there somewhere tries to make up for being incredibly short (<2 hours at best) and linear by being teeth grindingly hard. The entire game revolves around mastering trick jumps......and that's about it as far as game play. The only real indication  of it being ""inspired by"" metroid or cave story lays in the graphics and sound. The game looks and sounds great but there just isnt enough game to go with it.

												This short platformer's got soul, a cool 8 bit soundtrack and tight controls.I'll skip the story and let you figure that one out for yourselves. The core gameplay consists of platforming, shooting things and using your teleport gun to... well teleport around the place and get over obstacles. There are collectibles scattered all around the place which help you progress more easily and help with the final boss battle.The soundtrack compliments the mood that the artist has set here; marooned on a strange planet of slug creatures, now stop crying, take that teleport gun, fix your ship and get revenge! It's an incredibly fun experience although it is rather short. My first playthrough took me a little bit over an hour and 30 minutes to complete. Second was a bit over 40 minutes and the last speedrun was just under 20 minutes.I wouldn't hesitate getting this game even at full price though I must note that it was on sale with a hefty -96% discount when I bought it.

												This review is going to be a little bit unfair, but then I feel I was misled. At the time of this writing, the ""About"" section describes this game as ""Inspired by games such as Cave Story and Super Metroid"", and it's tagged as a ""Simulation"", ""Strategy"", and ""Metroidvania"" game.It is none of these things. This is a short, hard, linear puzzle platformer, with brief side-scrolling shooter bookends. The game as it is is pretty okay, and I got it on sale, but I spent my entire playtime wondering when the game map was going to open up and I was going to start getting interesting upgrades, which never happened.Bottom line, misleading store page, thumbs down.

												This is a fun but short platformer/shooter.I appreciate that the developers used multiple game modes.  This is tough to do, and normally one of the game modes feels tacked on.  In this case the platformer is the more developed of the modes, but the shooting sequences are not bad.The art is nothing to write home about, but the gameplay is fun and that is what matters.

												I've never seen this mechanic before, it's very fun and gives some interesting puzzle platforming. And it is very well explored in the level design. I love the visuals too. Quality pixel art, very cute. The game sits mostly on the easy side. I figured out the mechanics quickly and at worst I died 3 to 4 times on the hardest rooms and sailed through the game in about an hour. The bullet hell sections, however, are pretty hard! at least to me, I hate bullet hell games. It is a very small part of the game, but it makes me wonder about mixing such completely different genres. But I digress. This is not an issue with Out There Somewhere, the spaceship sessions are short and few. It's extremely short though. But without considering price, length is not a very useful piece of information. What I mean by that is I think the game is worth what they are asking for. It's a short, adorable, original and fun little game and it's cheaper than a sandwich. I'm a very satisfied customer.

												Well, some pixels here and there, few will love it instantly, few will hate, and the rest? Well, they will land on the planet and will die a lot, just because it is fun, challenging and rewarding once they'll master controls and tricks. Storyline isn't complex but it's not a bad thing for Out There Somewhere and yet you feel good once you make progress, and notice as sprites changes. When you found out the pattern of combined challenge and exploration you improve with controls and tricks and overall game experience gets better and better, because every part of the game is like a puzzle, once you start getting whole image game becomes great. Out There Somewhere is casual platformer with nice pixels and enjoyable chiptunes which can take up few hours to complete, depending on your teleporting performance. Play it in a spare moment and you won't regret time spent on Out There Somewhere. Sequel would be nice, tho. 9/10			",565,144,24,62,34,5,69

												I purchased this game for $0.19 and I could say that it's worth at least this amount, but it is most certainly not worth the full price. Out There Somewhere has a very brief playtime of about an hour and, as it aesthetically calls back to older games with similar playtimes, this would normally be fine. I say normally because this is where the problem lies - while many games from the era Out There Somewhere seeks to mimic can technically be finished in an hour or less, they are usually challenging enough (though not necessarily always for good reasons) to occupy players for hours before they can scrape by with a victory. Out There Somewhere, on the other hand, simply poses so little challenge for the vast majority of its duration that I can count the number of rooms with any sense of difficulty from either the puzzles or the platforming on a single hand (4).This is a case of a game where the concept simply does not live up to its full potential. The teleport gun is a neat mechanic, but it is a largely wasted one as environmental obstacles and puzzles are repeatedly reused in the same handful of ways - you're going to be shooting at a whole lot of blue beams either halfway up a jump or on the way down from a jump in order to reach a platform a bit farther away. There are a few optional secrets, but as this is primarily a puzzle game it is not really worth the effort to go back through the whole game again if you miss one the first time around.While aesthetically appealing, Out There Somewhere is ultimately an unsatisfactory experience as it is lacking in narrative, challenge, and, other than the concept itself, any real sense of creativity.

												A really nice and simple puzzle platformer done in the 16-bit style. It is fairly easy and short, controls are easy to learn and responsive, but the puzzles do requier some accurate timing skills, so it's not trivial to play through. There's also a small shoot-em-up minigame done in the same style. The graphics and music are very nice and fit well to the overall retro atmosphere.Even it costs practically nothing the game is way too short and leaves you wanting for more.

Out There Somewhere takes obvious cues from Metroid and Cave Story but it doesn't feel derivative at all, there's some super inventive platforming in this game with its teleportation gun.

												This is a very special platformer, because you have a teleport gun where you can shoot yourself over the screen. I find this idea very good, have never played I platformer like this. I can only recommend it for insanely -96% on sale. Buy it and get every achievement, it is worth it ;D			",162,47,10,16,17,0,19

												A very well made game, a great combination of various classic platformer games.I have no complaints other the then hillariously over simplified story, which I believe was intentional too (or not?).Highly reccomend this game to those who enjoy platformer games such as Mario, Megaman, or even the modern Shovel Knight			",5,0,0,0,1,0,0

The Short:-Short and sweet way to get your platforming fix.The Thick::Pros::Interesting platforming dynamics made possible with unique teleport gun.Short enough to enjoy entire game in single play session.Priced fairly for what you get out of it (right now it is 1.99 USD and can be bought in indie bundle as well)Enjoyable throughout.::Cons::Really short. I continued my save file after the credits rolled in disbelief that the end came that quickly.NPCs are obnoxious. Most of them have nothing important to say and just get in the way of the gameplay flow.The platforming portion of the singular boss battle can be forced to only use his first two attacks simply by getting enough (like 3) attacks off on him during each cycle. This makes for an incredibly simple boss battle that felt more like just another platforming room rather than a boss.There is no real incentive to collect the optional ship parts. The shoot-em-up section of the boss battle is doable without upgrading the ship.Spoilers: Forced cliffhanger ending where the villian is still ""Out there somewhere.""Random Thoughts:I dunno... this game really makes me wonder if the developer didn't have a strict plan for what they wanted to make. The existance of relatively numerous NPCs suggest that there was going to be more of a purpose for them. Maybe for lore/world-building purposes? There also is really weird pacing in the game... though it is difficult to describe with the game being so short. I suspect (though I should note I have no idea if this is true) that this was planned to be a longer game. It certainly feels like there should be more (again, the price is very fair for what you get), and like many others seem to be saying, this entire game feels like it should be the tutorial/intro level of a larger game... and I think that was probably the plan initially...Everything points to that theory:An abundance of NPCs most likely for world-buildingStylized artwork for textbox profiles and the rare cutsceneProgressive upgrade system for ship, which could have been spread out over the course of the game, as it felt completely unneccesary for the boss.Short to the point of it being unbelievable that the end falls where it doesSee final item on Cons.I do recommend this game because it's a great concept. I'm just disappointed that it wasn't explored further than it was. Don't get me wrong, I understand the limitations that a small team of developers can bring... I just think this could have been a great game. I'm disapointed not in the game, but in Miniboss for creating such a small game out of a concept with plentiful potential,			",116,31,2,10,12,2,8

 Out There Somewhere It's a small game, but bunch of Fun you'll have. :) GamePlay: The gameplay is as simple as the game is and yet sometimes challenging. At the beginning you'll have no weapon, which will change very soon till you get a teleport gun!Teleporter gun: You can shoot with this gun and the time it hits an object you'll teleport to this point. Anyway this is just the half impressive part of it, because you can jump and while you're moving upward you can teleport yourself, but the physic of moving upward keeps. This is the part where it becomes a bit tricky to time you shoots.Normal gun: Additional to the telegun you'll also receive a normal gun to shoot enemies. If you acquire the additional upgrade you'll shoot faster and deadlier which makes the run way easier.This is the Charakter Gameplay. There are also objects in the world which tries to build up riddles for you. ;)I love the idea. <3 (One point loss because it's really short 1h 20min. first run. :/ I wish I could be longer)★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ Graphics: The graphics is a pixelstyle and not very impressive.^^ It looks very nice, but I just cannot give all points!★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ Story: The Story is also well made. ""Brevity is the soul of wit!"" this is something fitting to its story. It's indeed not very long, probably because of the length of the game, but you don't forget storypart which confuse you in futher progress.I really liked it. With some nice Cutscenes and dialogue.★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Leveldesign: If you want all Achievements then you should know that you have to visit (nearly) every screen in this game. literally!There are screens with no name and you'll have to see them to get the 107% Achievement. (I think it's pretty obvious why it's called 107%. :p)The normal screens are well created to make puzzles, as I've said it befor. ↑ up there ↑I don't see any reason to give less than the max. points.^^★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Music: My favorite part of any game with good music recommendation. <3 Well, this game contains so many good soundtracks. I nearly love all of them and for a good reason. If you wanna take a look at the main Theme:  Menu Theme ★ ★ ★ ★ ★The summary is, I would buy it again and the most time it is in sale for less than 30c. xD Get it. It's worth to play!★ ★ ★ ★ ★			",93,25,2,9,11,1,5

												A short but very replayable game, especially for speedrunners and achievement hunters. The puzzles are devious but well designed and it's fun to use the teleport beam in clever ways. Some of the moves are pretty tricky to pull off with some very strict timing required and might be frustrating to inexperienced players. An experienced platformer player might get through this in about an hour- there's an achievement for speed-running it in less than 20 minutes and I managed to do it in 15 after some practice. At full price this is a good buy- at 19p in the sales, it's a no-brainer.			",107,22,2,21,6,2,15

It utilizes creative gameplay mechanics that revolve around a gun that teleports you, which adds a puzzle-like quality to getting through some of the screens. It also has a fantastic soundtrack.My only disappointment with the game is how short it is, because I want more.			",34,18,0,3,1,1,0

It doesn't revolutionize, but it's still a very polished and solid experience. I think full price is asking a bit much for the short length, but you know how Steam works. Add the game to your wishlist and grab it when it goes on sale for around $1.99. I for one, got it on sale for $0.19. Needless to say, totally worth it.			",447,98,4,41,23,3,45

												I forgot what this game was about or how much I had paid for it. Decided to boot it to see what it was about and was welcomed with a shmup. Nothing all that exciting but it did look nice. Then you're introduced to the bigger part of the game, which is a puzzle platformer of sorts.I was immediately very impressed by the quality of the game, visually first then everything after. The puzzles were smart but not very complex; not that they were not enjoyable.I thought I was just starting and next thing I know, and hour or so later, I finished the game. I was a disappointed, especially considering how highly I regarded the game. It showed so much promise.Then I went to the store page and saw that the game is actually 1$. And I'm fairly certain I bought it on sales.I don't really feel like playing through it again right now but it was a lot of fun while it lasted and if you are up for it, you can complete more than one playthrough to get more hidden stuff. It's well, well worth the 1$, very short but very high quality.No ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, no pointless fillers, this game doesn't try to make up for what it lacks in content by throwing tedious stuff in. Just the essential, just what you need to have fun.			",393,155,6,57,30,3,50

												I can only recommend this game at the price I got it at, $0.19. At that price, it's well worth it. At the price listed, it's really not. The game throws you onto an alien world in a story that tries to be more than it is. If this game is part of a series, something would be explained, but on its own it is unremarkable. The big hook to the game is that you have a teleporting gun that allows you to warp to wherever you hit with the gun. You retain your momentum, so much like Portal you encounter some interesting puzzles. The puzzles are seldom difficult, with the only real difficulty coming from the imprescision you deal with. Occasionally you'll encounter something where you have to think in order to proceed, but I got through these by just shooting and somehow ending up where I needed to be. There is a secondary weapon that damages enemies as well. It was a good choice to introduce this weapon, as it does introduce some variety in the gameplay. However, the weapon never quite ""feels"" right. It's hard to explain. Combat, for what there is of it, feels frustrating, especially when you fail later in the room and have to do it over again. Still, having the gun does add to the gameplay. When you die, you respawn quickly. This is good since you will want to try again quickly, but sometimes it can lead to you dying 2 or 3 times in a row because you're still moving when you spawn. This futher compounds the difficulty of a particularly tough puzzle.The game lasts about 45 minutes. I enjoyed most of my time with it, and there are some interesting obstacles introduced throughout, but I did find myself wishing things would get mixed up a little more towards the end, or just wanting the game to end. Overall, there's a lot of potential here. The teleporter gun brings some neat ideas, and the environments are well built around the mechanic. And it's worth the price at 96% off. It's a nice little game, that shows that the developer has a lot of upward potential for their next games.			",103,8,3,3,3,1,13

												I can recommend this game, but not at the price they're charging. The game is extremely short - one or two hours long. It feels like it's over just as soon as you've figured out how to play. The controls are interesting, but they don't feel all that tight. (They're not bad, but not great either.) The graphics, sound, and music get the job done but aren't particularly compelling. The level design is pretty decent, but not great. There is some mildly humorous dialog. All-in-all, it's a decent game, but it's just so short.Get the game if it's on sale, maybe.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Product received for free
												A space metrovania game. I believe i got this game for free as a gift from a friend if i recall.Anyways this game is quite short. Notice my time above the review? That is how long it took me to beat the game. Be aware i probably did not find every secret or searched the levels extensively.One thing i found annoying about this game was the fact on some maps your forced to go only one way, even though the game is clearly meant to be like a metrovania game that should let you go back to older maps, but some maps it is incredibly hard, if not impossible to do.Because of the way the maps are, i cannot recommend this game. Playing it again got very repetitive very fast. If your into these type of games, this might be fun for you...but due to shortness, very difficult traversing maps, and also, the music was a bit bland to me.			",141,67,0,101,29,0,11

												The game is not too easy, but by no means is hard, the game can be picked up by just about anyone and be enjoyed.The only thing that I don't like about the game is I can't imagine paying the full $4.99 for it.Granted I bought the game at the extreme summer sale discount, the game is incredibly short, I finished the game in a little over an hour and by no means was trying to speed run in any way. This gave me a very unpleasant ""this is it?"" moment by the time I encountered the final boss, leaving me wanting more from a game that is by all accounts incredibly fun, the teleport mechanism is used extremely well, almost addicting, a shame it was over so soon.The hidden items are a bit tricky to get but worth it as they make the final boss extremely easy, and too easy at that if you want a real challenge, so I'd avoid them if thats what your looking for.Now my review may seem to lean on the negative side, but I would still recommend this to anyone as a fun time waster, but at the same time I'd recommend they get it while its on sale.

												Nice short platformer game that is very casual. You get ship wrecked and you find things so you can fly your ship again.The difference that this platformer brings to the table is that the main character uses a portal like gun, when the bullet hits certain surfaces you get teleported to that location. This added in some puzzles to the platforming and made it more unique. +Retro art if you are into it+Nice mechanics +Easy to pick up and play+Why walk when you can shoot a wall-Music gets repetitive-Dialog is not even worth mentioning-no replay value(at least I do not feel like its worth doing speed runs)All in all the price for this game is probably not worth it since you can get more fun games or more ""value"" games that take longer to beat. If you can get it for like a dollar, you might as well get it to support the dev and enjoy this nice short game. ",445,125,10,35,34,5,50

												A superb little game. Far more deserving of an indie game award than most that that actually receive them.Don't be put of by the 8-bit retro visuals, or the overly cheap price tag. It is excellently designed and play tested to perfection. Unless you try to obtain all eleven cores you won't see just how true this is or how devious the developers have been!Skill, not luck, rules in this game. Those who say otherwise are, in my view, mistaken... Experimentation is encouraged via ""seemingly"" generous save points and it's best achievements will encourage you to play it several times with various completion aims in mind.Five hours of real entertainment(if you push yourself to unlock all of it's secrets), something you don't always get from games costing many times as much!

												Nice short platformer game that is very casual. You get ship wrecked and you find things so you can fly your ship again.The difference that this platformer brings to the table is that the main character uses a portal like gun, when the bullet hits certain surfaces you get teleported to that location. This added in some puzzles to the platforming and made it more unique. +Retro art if you are into it+Nice mechanics +Easy to pick up and play+Why walk when you can shoot a wall-Music gets repetitive-Dialog is not even worth mentioning-no replay value(at least I do not feel like its worth doing speed runs)All in all the price for this game is probably not worth it since you can get more fun games or more ""value"" games that take longer to beat. If you can get it for like a dollar, you might as well get it to support the dev and enjoy this nice short game. ",445,125,10,35,34,5,50

												This game is mightily fun. For the 19p i bought it for i wasn't expecting a lot but here i am still playing it several hours later and wanting to play more. The Hardest part of this game is just getting used to the teleport gun and the momentum jumping but once u got the jist of it its pretty easy..It defintely is reminisent of Super mario with castelvania thrown in the mix. Trust me once u pop this game you will keep playing it..Good fun all in all! give it a whilr, you will be pleasantly suprised.Gameplay 9/10 ... Visually 8/10 .... Fun factor 10/10!!

												Where to start with this one? Well I got it for a beautiful 19 cents. Entering the game, I was assaulted with the most amazing 16-bit(?) soundtrack that I had ever heard in my life. I could already tell that it would be fun. And it is. For how simple it is gameplay wise, the art, story, mechanics, and overall game universe was simply incredible. Ontop of it all, everything was diverse. There was an outstanding variety in enemies and characters, and the fact that there's no linear path for you to follow is great. You can play the game over mutliple times and take different paths to do so. 10/10 would get exploded by 3 pixel bat again.			",38,1,0,5,3,0,0

												i picked this game up for 15 pence and didn't really expect too much from it however after starting it up i was pleasently surprised to realise that it is a wonderful game and i cannot reccomend it enough to anyone wo is a fan of platformers or puzzle games as this has elements of both in it. The puzzles are bothe simple and yet confusing for a first time through and yet when you figure it out you will be wondering how you couldn't see the solution earlier if i could nitpick one thing it's that there is no way to turn off the tutorials if you intend on a second playthrough. Also i sold the cards from it for 18 pence so i came out with a great game and financial profit.			",183,23,3,38,12,1,16

												I picked this game up for about 20 whole cents, and boy, can I ever say it was worth it.My first playthrough lasted me about an hour, but at the end, I felt satisfied. Since then, I've played through the game several more times to explore, collect, and just speed through it. Out There Somewhere doesn't do much, I'll say that. However, what it does, it does VERY well. I'm still thirsting for more.The controls for the game felt tight and I had no issues with moving, shooting, or jumping (I use a controller). Not once did I feel like I could blame the game for falling or dying. It was just a matter of getting faster with the timing, or better at positioning.As far as sound goes, the music is incredibly well done. There are several tracks in the game that change as you progress through the different areas. A few of the tracks are just mindblowingly good for how small the game is. As for sound effects, there aren't an awful lot, but they aren't ear grating which is nice.Aesthetically, the game looks wonderful. If the audio wasn't enough to tell you that Cave Story was an inspiration, the visuals will help remind you. I find the graphics to be very pleasing and easy on the eyes, and it's very easy to tell the different mechanics apart so the puzzles don't feel as frustrating to figure out.Finally, the gameplay. The gameplay is very basic. You can run, you can shoot your portal, and you can shoot your gun. Not much else to it, but that isn't a bad thing. The puzzles aren't overly difficult, either, but there is definitely a learning curve to them. My first time playing, I'd take a few minutes to figure out some of the puzzles. In later playthroughs, it's fun to see just how fast you can get through the puzzles that had stumped you before. Just because the puzzles aren't overly difficult doesn't detract from how rewarding it is to solve them.Overall, the game is very well done. For just $0.20, I'd say it's absolutely worth it. Even for $5.00, I'd say it's worth it if you plan to play through the game multiple times, trying to complete it. Out There Somewhere was a surprising hit, and I'm absolutely glad that I purchased it.			",589,120,8,86,34,4,69

												Out There Somewhere is a 2014 platformer developed by unknown studio Miniboss. Another in a long line of Super Metroid lookalikes, it's enjoyed some success mainly due to being incredibly cheap. But rather then simply riding on the coattails of Super Metroid (or Knytt, as it were), Out There Somewhere proves to be an enjoyable linear puzzle platformer, with a teleportation mechanic that features conservation of momentum similar to Portal (though the two have no real similarity beyond that).  It's no metroidvania by any stretch of the imagination - most of the ""upgrades"" are for an endgame effect that doesn't amount to much, and outside of that venture there's a total of 5 collectibles. Instead of playing a retro pixel wannabe, I played a well-paced linear adventure, that nevertheless isn't perfect. Most of the pacing is due to just how short it is - a playthrough won't run you longer than an hour (15 minutes if you know what you're doing) and the sheer lack of enemy variety becomes apparent on subsequent playthroughs. Add to that, that while the sprites are well designed and look quite nice on inspection (thankfully, not using the retro clause of pixel art to turn out subpar product) the very poorly handed tiling and lack of visual noise make the game's art look much more amateur than it really is.This is most readily apparent during the intro and outro space battles. With a closer look, you can see the spaceships slowly rotating, the metal sheens and the sci fi aesthetic shining through, when taken as a whole it looks so empty and barren that you could mistake it for a first-year highschooler's Game Maker project. These aren't particularly pressing issues; Out There Somewhere suffers from a lack of talking points. This isn't a particularly interesting game, and for all the secrets thrown into its linear world or the cool design of the protagonist, if this game hadn't gone for 20 cents then I wouldn't be recommending it. I wouldn't have even bought it. I've played Newgrounds games with more lasting value. At $5, I wouldn't recommend it unless you're the type that goes for 100% completion. At the ridiculous sales price, I fully recommend Out There Somewhere as a snack-sized short romp to pace out the larger, more memorable videogames.			",167,32,1,20,5,0,2

												When Steams summer sale was going, I decided to buy lots of 19 cent games, because why not. Without saying, almost everyone of those games seemed to be... below avarage and usually end up idling cards for them, but this game was a nice exeption. When I opened the game what I found was really well polished indie puzzle platformer. It doesn't offer anything majorly groundbreaking nor flashy, but because everything feels, looks and sounds really nice, it kept me interested in it. Pacing seems great with new mechanics introduced slowly, once gotten hang of the momentum mechanic controls feel tight and music makes you want to keep going even after several deaths. Only negative may be that it's an hour experience, for some it may not feel like worthwhile to give money, but there's something great about beating game in single day and it's freaking cheap!Shout out to awesome soundtrack as well: https://miniboss.bandcamp.com/releases- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Kun Steamissa oli kesäalennukset, päätin muuten vain ostella paljon 19 sentin pelejä. Sanomattakin melkein kaikki niistä oli... keskivertoa huonompia ja suurimmasta osasta tyydyin saamaan kortit, mutta tämä peli oli mukava poikkeus tähän. Kun avasin pelin huomasin sen olevan hyvin viimeisen päälle kiillotettu indie tasohyppely pulmapeli. Se ei tarjoa mitään maata räjäyttävää tai kiiltävää, mutta koska kaikki tuntuu, näyttää ja kuulostaa erittäin hyvältä, se piti minut kiinnostuneena. Pelin tahti tuntuu hyvältä ja uusia mekaniikkoja tulee hitaalla tahdilla vastaan, kun vauhtimekaniikkaan pääsee sisälle kontrollit tuntuvat tiukoilta ja musiikki pitää pelissä vaikka olisi juuti kuollut muutamaan kertaan. Ainoa negatiivinen asia taitaa olla että se on todellakin vain tunnin mittainen, joka voi joillekin olla ehkä liian pieni kokemus josta pitäisi maksaa, mutta se tunne että pääsee pelin läpi yhdessä päivässä on erittäin mukava ja se on järkyttävän halpaa! Myös maininta mahtavalle pelin soundtrackille: https://miniboss.bandcamp.com/releases ",689,179,12,64,31,6,76

												One of the most adorable indie platformers I've played.Out There Somewhere gets all things right. You have to explore a weird planet in order to be able to launch your ship into space (again). The controls are very simple - you only get to use 3 buttons (teleport gun, jump and gauss gun), other than the directional ones, throughout the entire game - but that's more than enough in order to tackle the game's puzzles, enemies and areas.Most of the areas require a bit of thinking, and in some cases, reflexes, in order to reach the ""end"" of the screen and get to the next one. Every screen represents an entirely different area you need to pass.Out There Somewhere is challenging enough for gamers of all ages and levels, but at the same time, you will never feel frustrated, even if you fail to overcome a certan obstacle in several attempts. The game's atmosphere and (retro) music are just too adorable for that.The game can be completed in ~2 hours. And while it may not be a game that will keep you coming back for more, unless you're an achievement junkie, you can rest assured that it will provide you with few hours of pure, retro platforming fun!

												Simple and short but extremely fun and creative little platform/puzzle game. This game was made by a very small team, and it's a really impressive achivement! You've got an extremely limited move set - you can jump around, you can fire a teleport beam, and you eventually get a blaster - but you'll use that limited move set in a wide variety of funny, clever, unexpected ways. There were so many times where I thought, ""Oh, this trick move won't work"", and then it did! So then what if I jump off here and then shoot my beam there, but before I land, I jump and then...oh, that worked too! The game is just full of surprises like that and all these puzzles that test your creativity, logic, and ability to exploit the mechanics. I also really like the pixel graphics - the art style is charming and memorable. I don't actually have any real critiques here! It's a short game, but it never outstays its welcome. There are even a decent amount of secrets and it'll take you a while to really collect everything. On top of all of these strengths, Out There Somewhere is really cheap - it even often goes on sale for something like 25 cents. You can't beat that! You can wait for one of those super cheap sales if you like, but this is an awesome little game at any price. In fact, this is probably one of the best deals on Steam, bar none.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Somewhat simple to solve plattformer. In my first attempt I needed under an hour, and there wasn't really a puzzle that made me ponder more than a few moments. (However, I do have a long history of plattformer experience, so it might be a decent difficulty for casual gamers and beginners)Its still a charming game though. I liked the bouncy retro graphics, the ""all your base are belong to us""esque-cutscenes with the very flat dialogues and even enjoyed the music in this short retro flashback.So: If you can get it really cheap on a sale like I did, and enjoy oldschool puzzle plattformers with a relaxing difficulty, I don't think you can go wrong with it. The full prize would've been too high for my taste though.			",69,89,0,65,9,1,26

												It's an OK game. The mechanics is pretty unique. I like how the gun makes you teleport. The main problem is its super short. I wanted more levels! Will definitely come back for more.			",147,29,4,7,12,3,13

												Not bad at all. Seeing the retro style graphics, you might think that this is one of those trash indie games that people make to grab some quick cash (I don't hate retro or 8-bit graphics at all, its just that this is overused to make lots of trash games found across steam). Level 1 further fuels your doubt with the old space shooter thing.But the idea of the teleport gun introduced in level 2 makes it a rather unique platformer with an original concept. This together with the throwaway price makes this a recommendable buy.Also has trading cards and achievements.			",32,5,1,2,0,0,2

												While this is a cute puzzle game, I feel like it lacks any real depth. I read somewhere this played and felt like a Metroid game but I have to disagree. It's more like Portal with a Metroid paint job and stripped of all charm. Great time killer for an afternoon. Nothing much after that. 4/10			",24,28,0,1,0,1,2

												Surprisingly great, actually. I say that because I paid less than a quarter near the release date. Things to know:1. It was heavily influenced by Super Metroid and Portal. This is done really well too. There is also ideas borrowed from VVVVVV such as titles for each screen, among other games.2. It is very difficult, puzzle-wise.3. It is sandboxy.4. Music and sound is pretty awesome too.Its worth full price if you want a difficult puzzle game as described above. I cannot comment on length since I have not finished it yet. ",561,161,5,75,79,8,72

												Bought the game on sale for $0.19.  Took 51 minutes from start to finish, including the time spent looking at the controls, watching the little intro, etc.  For $0.19 it is worth it.  For $5 it just isn't.  There's little challenge, and while the graphics work and sounds and music are great throwbacks to old school gaming, the game play gets boring fast.  I may go back and play another hour someday to try to get all the achievements or something, but story and game play wise there is zero replay value.  Worth it at $0.19, not worth it for much more.

												This was a fun game. This was also a shockingly short game. When I reached the end, I fully expected it to really just be the end of the intro, and to actually open up a larger world with many more hours of gameplay. But no, it turned out really was the end, and Steam says I only played 56 minutes.Also, don't be fooled by anyone who says this draws inspiration from Super Metroid. It absolutely doesn't. There is no backtracking in this game (unless you're trying to hunt down all 11 hidden objects, which isn't really worth it), or really anything else that Super Metroid is famous for.

												Out There Somewhere is a platformer/shooter game in which you find yourself crash landed on a distant planet far from your home world. At first it may seem to be more along the lines of an ""R-Type""-esque scrolling shooter, but that only lasts for a moment. Stranded, you need to find a new power core for your space ship so you may return from being ""Out There Somewhere"".The gameplay is simple to grasp but it has several nuances that require a great deal of practice in order to master. Using the WASD keys you move your character back and forth, and you use the x and c button to shoot your portal gun and use something else found later in the game ( no need to spoil that ). While the controls at first may seem a bit wonky (nor is there an option to remap the keys), with a little time it is not hard to get used to them. Your teleporter gun will be your main mode of transportation and movement. While the game is inspired by Portal, instead of using the one end spits out another end, your teleporter gun changes your location to match where the bullet hits a wall. One of the cool mechanics surrounding this is that your momentum before you teleport is maintained after the teleport, allowing you to jump just before impact to scale walls you normally would not be able to get over.The music in the game is a pleasent albeit repetitive set of chiptunes, each unique area having its own sound. There is an option to turn off the music present in the main settings (along with various in-game sounds). Story is minimal at best, and history is presented through both the visuals and interactions you will have the inhabitants of this planet.Gameplay: 9Music: 8Story: N/AMechanics/Controls: 9Overall: 8.75/10The game itself is very solid although it is very short, at $5 it is definitely worth the look. It also often goes on sale for as low as $0.19, and at that price the game is a must buy for anybody that enjoys platformers (while the trading cards will also cover the price as well).

												a short, adorable, little game and it's cheaper than a sandwich.The first thing you'll notice are the cute animated cutscenes. They are fairly short and clickable when you have read the subtext. You then are thrown into a sideways space invader type game with increasingly powerful weapons, ship upgrades, and enemies. This is a sort of trick though because when you get damaged down to one heart, and this won't take long, another cutscene flashes and you end up on a planet. This ground portion is a side view 2D platformer like Starbound or Terraria. Most of the game is this ground portion. You are taught some basics like how to jump and are eventually introduced to a wicked cool teleport gun similiar to Chell's gun in Portal. More games should have portal making abilities. You'd think more people are thinking with portals by this point. I digress. You will use this gun and platforming to complete puzzles. Eventually you will encounter the boss and beat the game, unlike me. I was unable to beat the game because timing things and puzzles usually fill me with rage rather than joy. Also a minor framerate issue. I was consistently getting an unplayable (5 fps) framerate on planet. If this issue happens to you then store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds. <--DON'T ABUSE THIS SYSTEMYou'll love the pixel art and upbeat music. You will bob your upper body and head like a slowly wiggling fish. If you use a gamepad or whatever you will be content. However, if you seek mouse support in menues or in the game you will have to keep seeking. The English, French, and Portuguese languages are available via a toggle in the options menu. The ingame menu is limited so don't expect to change volume or controls outside of the main menu at the start of the game. This game has a unique menu option to show or hide playtime.

												Relatively short little platformer taking ~2 hours to beat, but good fun nonetheless. The game focuses mainly on the use of a portal gun to deal with various, some relatively challenging, physics-based puzzles. While the game is somewhat devoid of much of a plot line, I could look past it with the humble attempts at humor and the nice aesthetics in the 16-bit graphical style. I grabbed this one in the summer sale and can safely say I can see no finer way spending $0.19.			",438,112,6,57,36,5,60

												""Inspired by Cave Story, Metroid, and Portal""I think a better mashup is Cave Story, R-type, and Portal (with a much smaller scope). I didn't personally get the Metroid vibes.Out There Somewhere is a fun short game (I beat it in about 45 minutes) with good aesthetics and decent level of difficulty. It may only leave you wanting more, as the whole game feels more like a ""first stage"" than a complete game. It definitely has the potential to be something much greater, but overall, I still recommend it. I'd make sure to grab it on sale though, as in my mind, the game is too short for the full price.

												Out There Somewhere is a exploration platformer with a mechanic of teleportation. You control Yuri on his quest to repair his ship and escape the planet he crashed on. Armed with a teleportation gun which allows you to fire a shot and then teleport where it lands, you must use this mechanic to your advantage to progress.This game makes excellent use of its core mechanic. The platforming feels solid and incorporates the telegun very well. The difficulty curve feels right, gradually increasing so the player has to use what they have learned in prior levels in new and different ways. Progressing requires quick reflexes and some thinking, and death isn't a hindrance due to instant-respawn. The aesthetic of the game is great, with pixel visuals, and the chiptune soundtrack adds to the feel. The game is a bit short, however. It took me about an hour of gametime to beat the game on my first run, and it left me wanting more. What the game provides is excellent and leaves me wanting more, which could have easily been added. The final boss felt a little underwhelming and could probably have used the game's mechanics better. Overall, I rate Out There Somewhere a 8/10, on the basis that the game is a bit short.

												A cute little game by a developer who obviously loves the style and genre.  The puzzles weren't terribly difficult, though a couple required very exact precision and thus might take you one try or a hundred to get right.  Don't expect combat to be any more difficult than the puzzles.Definitely worth more than the nineteen cents they're charging during the Summer Sale.  Not sure if it's worth five dollars, though; it feels like the first chapter or so of a Metroidvania rather than an entire game.Keeping an eye on this developer!			",173,81,0,38,23,4,24

There's minimal combat, aside from some shooty bits. I beat it in a little over an hour on my first playthrough. There are achievements to unlock that can extend your time with the game, if you're into that sort of thing.It's pretty simple, but that's a lot of its charm.

												This is a ""puzzle platformer."" While it also includes elements of a metroidvania (you collect 1 power-up to enable access to more of the zones, as well as a few health/ship powerups), I would prefer to compare the game to VVVVVV, Cave Story, and Portal 2.The sounds and graphics are throwbacks to Nintendo/Super Nintendo era, which is more than adequate for a 2d ""pixel-perfect"" platformer. As you play you are slowly taught the many tricks to beating this game. However, excepting the gun upgrade, you can perform all of those tricks from the very beginning (and have to for some of the hidden treasures). There is a story, but it is intentionally ignorable. This game is about puzzle-platforming.Play control is super-tight. Any errors made are completely your fault.The biggest drawback to the game is its length. It is extremely short (a speedrun of the game should take you between 12-20 minutes). This isn't necessarily a negative--there are only so many ways to do the same kind of puzzle before it becomes tedious, and the game avoids that by not padding the game out.			",314,74,4,58,20,1,43

												I bought this game for 0,19€ during sales and I feel like I stole the game.The game's quality is well worth it's price (4,99€)^^. Review (SPOILERS!!)Graphics-The graphics are pixelated and are really nice to look at.They kinda remind me of Cave Story ^^. Gameplay-The gameplay is really interesting.You have a ship during the opening section and it's kinda like those arcade space shooters where you go up and down and shoot things that are coming infront of you.After the first short ship section is over you are able to walk on the ground, you have a portal gun but it's nothing like the one from ,,Portal series"" more like a Teleport gun. The teleport gun teleports you when the projectile hit's a wall or something else and it makes for some pretty clever ways to pass trough an obstacle. You can find a gun at some point an you can kill enemies with it. There are hidden ship parts an heart containers, the ship parts can be used to upgrade your ship for the final boss battle and the heart containers to make you capable of taking more hits before kicking the bucket. There are only 2 ship sections in the game and they are : Introduction section and final boss ^^. Story-The story is very simple, your space ship is under attack by a notorious villain called Grigori and at the first ship part of the game your ship gets damaged and you crash on an unknown planet. You (the captain of the ship) need to repair your ship and catch Grigori.Grigori is finally defeated by the end of the game or is he?Maybe he is still ,, Out There Somewhere"" Pros +Stage Design.                                        +Music suits                                   the game                                    perfectly.+Good cutscene Art.+Responsive controls.+Fluid sprite animation.+More than one wayto complete the game.+Cards are easy to get.Cons-Kinda Short.-Some music tracksare forgettable.-,,But How?""

												Here's a short and fun puzzle platformer using a teleporter gun mechanic (different from Portal). It requires some quick reflexes and basic puzzle solving skills but generous checkpoints means it's not too hard or frustrating. Good retro styled graphics and music, and it controls well (I played with a 360 gamepad). Takes about 1-2 hours to beat. If that length is worth the price is up to you to decide, but at 96% off it certainly was for me. No complaints, really.			",586,168,15,83,44,4,98

												Definitely recommended (whether at full price or at the insane deal I got it - $0.19), especially for fans of modern 8 or 16 bit style platformers like ""Cave Story+"" and ""VVVVVV.""At its core, ""Out There Somewhere"" is a retro platformer (with a brief bullet hell beginning and ending) that hinges on mastering teleportation and your reaction time to it. While it doesn't approach the sadistic difficulty of ""Super Meat Boy,"" for example, you will need to become increasingly agile and plan ahead in each room as the game progresses. While the core game length is shorter than I had hoped, there are a lot of hidden items to try to collect or you can try to best your speedrun time on another run-through.			",478,132,4,36,19,6,30

												Out There Somewhere is a 2D platformer game which would have fit right in back on the NES. While the graphics are probably a bit better than what would have been around back then in some places, on the whole this is a pixel graphics game whose gameplay harkens back to a much simpler time.You play Yuri, a space cop in hot pursuit of Grigori, some sort of bad guy. You start out trying to shoot down his ship, fail, and then have to travel across the planet to confront him and collect a light orb to repower your ship and beat him down in the end-game.The game is very simple. It claims to be inspired by Cave Story, Super Metroid, and Portal, but honestly it is its own thing, and not very much like any of those games. It is very linear, there isn’t much of a plot, and it is very centered around its central game mechanic – a teleportation gun.When Yuri fires his gun, he gets teleported to wherever it hits, with whatever momentum he presently has being preserved. He cannot teleport if he is already right next to the surface he would be teleporting to.He can also jump.These two mechanics make up pretty much all of the gameplay in the game. You do eventually get a gun you can kill monsters and destroy certain blocks with partway through the game, which opens up a few more puzzles, but most of the game is centered around platforming with the teleportation gun – including one room towards the end of the game with no platforms in it at all, which the player scales by shooting shots across the room, landing, then jumping just as the shot hits the far wall.The game cost 50 cents on sale, and is extremely short – this is the sort of thing you can beat in a single sit down. I was pretty heavily achievement and secret hunting and beat the game in 89 minutes my first time through. All that’s left at that point is trying to figure out how to acquire the last few secrets, many of which are pretty devious (such as requiring you to go through about a third of the game without saving once so you can die and respawn at the very start with the block-destroying gun, in order to acquire one of the secrets).Was it worth 50 cents and an hour and a half of my time? I can’t say I wasn’t entertained by it, but it wasn’t high-quality entertainment – the game is decent enough as what it is, but it is not exactly aiming for the stars. If you like 2D platformers with simple, straightforward mechanics, this is probably a decent choice for you; if you like nice graphics, complex gameplay, a sophisticated story, or anything else like that, you’ll probably be disappointed by this game.

The puzzles are challenging and require some skill although they can be done with some practice.  I'd say definitely get it, the price is tiny, and you will definitely feel that it is worth the meagre price you paid.  Also, a great bonus are the trading cards, and an 'easy' perfect game.

												""Inspired by Cave Story, Metroid, and Portal""I think a better mashup is Cave Story, R-type, and Portal (with a much smaller scope). I didn't personally get the Metroid vibes.Out There Somewhere is a fun short game (I beat it in about 45 minutes) with good aesthetics and decent level of difficulty. It may only leave you wanting more, as the whole game feels more like a ""first stage"" than a complete game. It definitely has the potential to be something much greater, but overall, I still recommend it. I'd make sure to grab it on sale though, as in my mind, the game is too short for the full price.

												Out There Somewhere is a exploration platformer with a mechanic of teleportation. You control Yuri on his quest to repair his ship and escape the planet he crashed on. Armed with a teleportation gun which allows you to fire a shot and then teleport where it lands, you must use this mechanic to your advantage to progress.This game makes excellent use of its core mechanic. The platforming feels solid and incorporates the telegun very well. The difficulty curve feels right, gradually increasing so the player has to use what they have learned in prior levels in new and different ways. Progressing requires quick reflexes and some thinking, and death isn't a hindrance due to instant-respawn. The aesthetic of the game is great, with pixel visuals, and the chiptune soundtrack adds to the feel. The game is a bit short, however. It took me about an hour of gametime to beat the game on my first run, and it left me wanting more. What the game provides is excellent and leaves me wanting more, which could have easily been added. The final boss felt a little underwhelming and could probably have used the game's mechanics better. Overall, I rate Out There Somewhere a 8/10, on the basis that the game is a bit short.

												A cute little game by a developer who obviously loves the style and genre.  The puzzles weren't terribly difficult, though a couple required very exact precision and thus might take you one try or a hundred to get right.  Don't expect combat to be any more difficult than the puzzles.Definitely worth more than the nineteen cents they're charging during the Summer Sale.  Not sure if it's worth five dollars, though; it feels like the first chapter or so of a Metroidvania rather than an entire game.Keeping an eye on this developer!			",173,81,0,38,23,4,24

												Out There Somewhere is a platformer/shooter game in which you find yourself crash landed on a distant planet far from your home world. At first it may seem to be more along the lines of an ""R-Type""-esque scrolling shooter, but that only lasts for a moment. Stranded, you need to find a new power core for your space ship so you may return from being ""Out There Somewhere"".The gameplay is simple to grasp but it has several nuances that require a great deal of practice in order to master. Using the WASD keys you move your character back and forth, and you use the x and c button to shoot your portal gun and use something else found later in the game ( no need to spoil that ). While the controls at first may seem a bit wonky (nor is there an option to remap the keys), with a little time it is not hard to get used to them. Your teleporter gun will be your main mode of transportation and movement. While the game is inspired by Portal, instead of using the one end spits out another end, your teleporter gun changes your location to match where the bullet hits a wall. One of the cool mechanics surrounding this is that your momentum before you teleport is maintained after the teleport, allowing you to jump just before impact to scale walls you normally would not be able to get over.The music in the game is a pleasent albeit repetitive set of chiptunes, each unique area having its own sound. There is an option to turn off the music present in the main settings (along with various in-game sounds). Story is minimal at best, and history is presented through both the visuals and interactions you will have the inhabitants of this planet.Gameplay: 9Music: 8Story: N/AMechanics/Controls: 9Overall: 8.75/10The game itself is very solid although it is very short, at $5 it is definitely worth the look. It also often goes on sale for as low as $0.19, and at that price the game is a must buy for anybody that enjoys platformers (while the trading cards will also cover the price as well).

												Out There Somewhere is a 2D platformer game which would have fit right in back on the NES. While the graphics are probably a bit better than what would have been around back then in some places, on the whole this is a pixel graphics game whose gameplay harkens back to a much simpler time.You play Yuri, a space cop in hot pursuit of Grigori, some sort of bad guy. You start out trying to shoot down his ship, fail, and then have to travel across the planet to confront him and collect a light orb to repower your ship and beat him down in the end-game.The game is very simple. It claims to be inspired by Cave Story, Super Metroid, and Portal, but honestly it is its own thing, and not very much like any of those games. It is very linear, there isn’t much of a plot, and it is very centered around its central game mechanic – a teleportation gun.When Yuri fires his gun, he gets teleported to wherever it hits, with whatever momentum he presently has being preserved. He cannot teleport if he is already right next to the surface he would be teleporting to.He can also jump.These two mechanics make up pretty much all of the gameplay in the game. You do eventually get a gun you can kill monsters and destroy certain blocks with partway through the game, which opens up a few more puzzles, but most of the game is centered around platforming with the teleportation gun – including one room towards the end of the game with no platforms in it at all, which the player scales by shooting shots across the room, landing, then jumping just as the shot hits the far wall.The game cost 50 cents on sale, and is extremely short – this is the sort of thing you can beat in a single sit down. I was pretty heavily achievement and secret hunting and beat the game in 89 minutes my first time through. All that’s left at that point is trying to figure out how to acquire the last few secrets, many of which are pretty devious (such as requiring you to go through about a third of the game without saving once so you can die and respawn at the very start with the block-destroying gun, in order to acquire one of the secrets).Was it worth 50 cents and an hour and a half of my time? I can’t say I wasn’t entertained by it, but it wasn’t high-quality entertainment – the game is decent enough as what it is, but it is not exactly aiming for the stars. If you like 2D platformers with simple, straightforward mechanics, this is probably a decent choice for you; if you like nice graphics, complex gameplay, a sophisticated story, or anything else like that, you’ll probably be disappointed by this game.

PresentationOut There Somewhere is possibly one of the most challenging, unique and intriguing platformers you'll ever play, as it puts you in control of a little alien, stranded on an unknown planet after his ship has crashed as a result of a space battle between him and his nemesis, Grigori, who ended up on the same planet as you, changing the lives of the planet's inhabitants. With that being said, you'll soon be on your way to recover the core needed for your ship to function again and finish what you've started, but to do so you'll have to traverse a long way, filled with danger, friendly and foe aliens and plenty of secrets. While the intelligent life on the planet will mostly only complain about how Grigori has influenced their lives since his arrival, and occasionally open a door for you or give you a hint to where you should head next, the more barbaric enemies simply known as monsters will often stand between you and your next objective, forcing you to think up different strategy on the move. While the plot isn't the most unique one and it certainly doesn't have any twists along the way, it is pleasing to see how many different areas and secrets you can find along the way, some which will often lead to items that will make your journey easier, such as abandoned cores or ancient alien artifacts. There is a certain lack of character development when it comes to the intelligent aliens, which will only interact with you with the same line of dialogue, which in most cases doesn't make any sense.Rating: 7GameplayAs any platformer you'll want to play, gameplay is the key element for an unforgettable experience, and in this aspect, Out There Somewhere brings some interesting concepts to the table, such as the teleport gun which allows you to send a beam to any wall that will teleport you there once it reaches its destination. As that mechanic alone would soon run out of challenging situations, blue, red and green beams will make puzzles more difficult, as red beams will block your teleportation beam, blue beams will stop the gun's beam at their location, and green beams will send it upwards. Combing those simple mechanics with the machine gun that will allow you to shoot enemies in your path in addition to using the teleport gun creates situations that are challenging, yet fun to solve and think your way out of. Secrets are also an important part of the experience, as exploration is rewarded with items such as health upgrades or the machine gun upgrade that allows you to shoot faster, and looking for different alternatives out of a certain screen will often take you to a completely new one with a new challenge ahead. The most important thing is that the game allows you to play however you want to, as you can avoid shooting enemies completely, making your way forward using the teleport gun alone, or take your time, explore the world around you and make sure you collect everything along the way.Rating: 8GraphicsOut There Somewhere goes for an old school look, with simple, low resolution textures formed out of squares, and while that art style fits the concept of the game fairly well, the problem comes in the form of repetition using those textures, as each screen will look similar to the previous one, and even when you do reach an area that's meant to feel and look different such as Grigori's Tower, it still feels like the same square with a different color shade on top.Rating: 6.5AudioThe audio quality is pretty cheap, which isn't necessarily a problem since there isn't much to hear aside from the effects that will only show up when you command them to. The soundtrack is okay for this time of game, but it does get boring pretty quickly, but since there isn't much else to hear aside from the background song, you could just mute it and play your own tunes.Rating: 5.5ExtrasIt will probably take you around one hour to complete Out There Somewhere for the first time, but just as a note the game can be completed in less than 15 minutes, and the game even encourages you to do that as it has a specific achievement. You could play it a second time to earn all the achievements and see the secret areas you might have missed, but afterwards that's it.Rating: 6VerdictOut There Somewhere is a cute, challenging adventure to spend your afternoon with, as long as you don't mind the fact that it will be over fairly soon, but for its low price and a possible secondary replay, it's worth a try.Rating Overall: 6.6Check out the full review and a lot more about Out There Somewhere at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=357 ",141,34,2,13,6,2,7

												i just finished this game and i absolutely loved it, its a puzzle platformer with simple but cool mechanics, its worth picking up at a sale since the game is only about 1 hour long if you only wanna play through it once without collecting all the cores or collecting all the achievements, the final boss was also a little underwelming wich wasent a big letdown but thinking back on it, it was all building up to that battle and it just took me getting the bosses attack patterns down and you're good to go and a littlebit of dodging.i really enjoyed this game and would love to see a sequal with more mechanics, puzzles, bosses, and all that jazz, because its been a long time since i've enjoyed a game as much as this one.props to the developers.9/10			",260,17,2,44,19,2,24

Posted: April 26, 2015
												The game feels a lot like a student project more than a completed video game.The story is almost non-existant, all you know is that you crash land on a planet and need to defeat some Russian named fellow. The gameplay, while decent, feels very unoriginal. Sure the idea of a gun that teleports you to where it hits seems novel at first, but the game doesn't really do much to challenge the player with the ideas presented by the gun. Also, the only real areas that feel like you would benefit from understanding the game's mechanics are, oddly enough, the first few screens. You can shave off, roughly, 15 seconds there by using teleport and jumps and just knowing how the jumping as a whole works. The absolute worst part of the game is the beginning and ending SHUMP sections though. The devs must not have known how to make a very good SHUMP because what they put forth was one of the worst I've ever experienced. The ship has can take several hits, which is nice because the hit detection can be a little wonky, but there's a lot of things that are just plain wrong. There's no invulnerablity at all after being hit in the ship, which means if you move incorrectly and get hit once you aren't given any time to regroup, you need to go into full panic mode. This also leads to another interesting glitch, which is also present in the normal sections of the game, if you get hit by something that explodes you take three hearts of damage. Be it a plane or missile in the SHUMP sections or the big monster's explosive shots. On the brightside, this allows you to finish the opening SHUMP section in 3 seconds as you only need to crash onto the planet and not beat the Russian guy.The game is a good pickup if it's really cheap, because you won't be able to squeeze much more than 4 hours out of it, assuming you're attempting to 100% it, and those 4 hours will definitely not involve you being fully engrossed by the game. If you want a Metroidvania game with more depth I recommend the Shantae games or Guacamelee.			",321,99,3,32,21,2,19

A shotgun? (would not hurt :D)=CO-OP, cause when u have your little story u dont want to play it alone. do u?I love this game, i just do, u need to take itTake it..TAKE ITI SAID TAKE IT FOR GOD SAKE!JK do what u want, if u don't take it, its your big mistake, not mine, alerdy got it, why do i speak so much, IDK maybe u can answer that question, but u don't know me and.....WTF i talk soo much? maybe u can...STOP ITJust buy it, worth every penny			",162,28,3,17,9,3,16

You play as a spaceship captain who, aided by helpful aliens must repair your ship to return out there somewhere.

My only complaint is that you can't change the keybinds of the 3 buttons this game has to any of the non-letter keys (at least, that's my experience). I wanted to map jump to space, but unfortunately, the game has a list of pre-set keybinds which the player can set.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												(8/10)Cute little game thats a fusion of the various games it mentions in its blurb.  The music/graphics are very reminiscent of cave story, as are the very tight controls.  The main game is an exploratory metroidvania style, with a few secrets and some definite portalish puzzle solving.The various elements gel very well together and the overall play was fun and engaging, while it lasted.  I'm not normally a 'time snob' but it definitely felt like the game was over all too soon.  Aiding that was the notion that there was never really a chance to go back and grab all those secrets you saw glimpses of earlier.  If you miss it, odds are, you missed it, and thats that.I may actually do a second walkthrough enhanced run just to see what effects some of the last things i didn't do would have, but as it stands if you mostly just do forward progress you can probably beat it in just an hour or two.  (some kinda plus mode, or just some oportunity to 'turn back' at the end so you could finish collecting would have been appreciated).As it stands though I did like it, and did have fun, and would reccomend it specifically to cave story fans who also like puzzle games because more than anything else this is a great fusion of those two styles.

												Listen, ok? The fact that this game is worth about 2-3 trading cards says something. And you can earn your money back in an instant. (During this insane sale where this game is only 19c) So, that's already a great deal. Also, as I wasn't expecting, THIS GAME IS ACTUALLY GOOD. It is actually really fun, and I enjoy the puzzle-like platform style. This is coming from a cave-story fan: This game is worth.			",56,10,0,8,5,3,6

												Out There Somewhere is a VERY good game, one of the best in my library. First the price to gameplay ratio is amazing. I have eight hours in this game, thats 10p an hour, and then there's the gameplay. The puzzles vary in hardness, but a lot of this requires high reaction time. Thus being said, I feel that the rage adds to the gameplay, but not in the way that puts you off the game and you leave to take up space space in your steam library for the rest of your life. I feel as if this game is extremely underrated and I would buy it for ten times the price. 10/10			",85,8,0,7,7,0,4

												This is a great little game! I am a huge fan of 2D side scrollers and this one is quite good. While the gameplay is tight and the puzzles are, well puzzling at times, the only complaint I have is that it's not that long. It took me about an hour and a half to play through on the first go. However, the smart achievements and great gameplay had me coming back for more. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good 2D side scrolling game. I was able to grab it on sale but if I had known how good the game was, I would have bought it at full price. Well worth it. Oh, and there are some great 8 bit scores that go perfectly with the tone of the game (lol see what I did there). Do yourself a favor and pick this one up, you won't be disappointed that you did.

												Hoooly crap this game is SO good. i cant believe its this cheap. If you like Portal and platform based games, this is for you... Because this game is basically the combination of those. If you want to spend a fun hour or so, but dont want to spend too much money, this game is for you; And even then, if you really like it (like me), you can try to complete achievements or speedrun (or both) which is what I do. The game itsleft lasts for 1-2 hours, (which is completely worth your money taking in account how cheap it is btw) and if you are a completionist or a speedrunner like me, this game can easily give you up to 10 hours of fun or even more. And its not just the play time; its the play value... Every single minute of this game is just pure fun. Its cheerfull, clever, it has perfect pacing and makes and its puzzles never get too easy or too hard. TL,DR: Amazing game, incredibly fun and unbelievably cheap. Give it a try, Im sure you can spare the money, I promise you wont regret it.			",57,23,1,3,0,0,2

												I bought the Developer Alliance bundle mostly because Polarity looked interesting.  Wasn't expecting much from the other games because retro platformers have been done to death and aren't really my thing.  To my surprise, this game turned out to be the real reason to buy the bundle.  It is stylin'.  Mechanically, it's like a 2D Portal with a little metroidvania and bullet hell thrown in.  It's short, but highly challenging and satisfying, with enough hidden goodies to make it worth doing an achievement run after clearing it once.			",342,170,8,99,29,5,60

												Picked it up in a Steam Sale for $.19 which was an amazing deal. It's a short game, my first playthrough was just over an hour. Some people might complain about that, but I thought it was perfect. With all the games in my backlog, I prefer a lean game that plays well, and isn't full of fluff.The game has a very straightforward premise, you crash land on a planet and need to find parts to repair your ship. You start off with a gun that shoots portals that you teleport to when they hit a surface. Every screen has some sort of puzzle requiring timing and finesse to progress. You eventually get a pea shooter, but it's mainly for breaking rocks and getting the odd enemy out of your way.There are a fair amount of achievements that require a second playthrough, but it's pretty much a breeze, because once you're familiar with the mechanics of the game, you can plow right through it.

												========================================Vince Rowe ReviewsSaving the Industry one Game at a Time![YouTube Link]  [Curation Link]  ========================================An amazing little puzzle platformer coupled with great 8-bit music and good old fashioned collectables!Verdict - 8.0/10Scroll to the bottom for an 'Overall' on the game.Gameplay - 9/10:Out There Somewhere starts off as a side-scroller shooter that you're pretty much destined to lose causing you to crash down to the planet below - this is where the real game begins. It's a pretty simple platformer but the twist is the teleport gun you get, it shoots like an ordinary gun and you'll be teleported to where it hits instantly with all of your momentum preserved. It flows really well making the movement of the game extremely fluid. You also get a 'Guass Gun' which is basically just a pew pew that kills enemies and breaks blocks. There are a few NPCs with a little bit of inane dialogue, and collectables littered across the landscape which - a majority of them - are puzzles. I played the entire game with the controller and it worked perfectly, haven't tried it with a keyboard though and quite frankly I don't want to.Level Design - 9/10:Level Design - or essentially the Puzzles - are all pretty great but most are based on timings and not necessarily using any logic, there are some red herrings with some of the puzzles but generally there are more 'jumping puzzles' than 'actual puzzles'. There are different types of blocks you'll encounter while you progress through the game like Glass, Mirrors, and Broken Blocks that spice it up a little, but I won't go into detail as it is a puzzle platformer after-all. Finally, there are enemies, all of which are pretty stupid, the AI is kind of dumb and mostly set up in way where they are only required to do one action. Don't expect to be doing any combat in this Platformer! The world itself is pretty cool though, coupled with the secrets and collectables it - partially - rewards exploration, I would have liked it if they made exploration more rewarding and beat off the linear path every so often with more easter eggs.Audio - 7/10:The music is pretty great, it's an 8-bit Techno-Sci-Fi style and fits in the game perfectly, the soundtrack of this game is excellent. Unfortunately that's about it though, sound wasn't used as well as it could have been and there's no voice acting with the dialogue...Graphics - 7/10:The graphics, which you can probably gather from the screenshots or from my gameplay footage are a dark, pixel art style, it reminds me of Risk of Rain, whilst I'm not the biggest fan of pixel art - as I normally feel that it's more of the lazy way out of the graphics situation - it does fit in with the game nicely.Overall - 8.0/10:A bloody great platformer that I thoroughly enjoyed playing! If you're a fan of puzzle platformers then Out There Somewhere definitely needs to be in your Steam Library. I completed it in about an 1 and 1/2 hours - but not 100% collectables/achievements. I did feel that it may have been a tad too easy though... I like my Platformers to be challenging!			",121,24,2,27,11,2,13

												Fantastic, but short, puzzle-platforming game. The primary mechanic is your telegun, whose bullets don't hurt enemies but do instantly teleport you to whatever surface they hit. The devs manage to stretch this mechanic quite a bit and create a few very tricky rooms. Art is just pixel art, but it's very good pixel art, and the music is stellar; overall, the alien atmosphere feels very well-fleshed-out. My main complaint is that this is not a Metroidvania game, as the inspirations it lists on the store page would imply; there are a couple heart containers and ship upgrades, but the latter are pretty useless and the game itself is basically linear. Rather than drawing in fans of Super Metroid or Cave Story, I think people who enjoyed VVVVVV would be the most likely to have fun with Out There Somewhere. Again, it's short: my first run through the game took about 50 minutes. Though, it's a good bit longer if you're a completionist, since getting all the achievements was about 3 hours total without a guide. Plus, if you're of the speedrunning type, then the telejump mechanic offers a lot of potential there. The game's only $2 at full price and gets even cheaper in sales and with various bundles, so if you happen to see it it's definitely worth picking up.			",89,10,1,6,2,1,15

A shotgun? (would not hurt :D)=CO-OP, cause when u have your little story u dont want to play it alone. do u?I love this game, i just do, u need to take itTake it..TAKE ITI SAID TAKE IT FOR GOD SAKE!JK do what u want, if u don't take it, its your big mistake, not mine, alerdy got it, why do i speak so much, IDK maybe u can answer that question, but u don't know me and.....WTF i talk soo much? maybe u can...STOP ITJust buy it, worth every penny			",162,28,3,17,9,3,16

												A 16-bit puzzle platformer that may be short but it packs quite a punch. It takes queues from many puzzle/platformers, such as: Portal, Half-Life, Braid, and VVVVVV, just to name a few. You play as a spaceship captain who, aided by helpful aliens must repair your ship to return out there somewhere. While the premise and the controls of the game are straight forward, this game is more challenging than meets the eye. If you enjoy bit graphics and are also a fan of platformers you should be playing it right now.			",25,0,1,1,1,0,0

												Best $0.19 game I've ever played. Really solid puzzle platformer. None of the puzzles are overly complicated, and the all work well with how the game functions. I would love to see a sequel that's a bit longer, as this one is fairly short. Although I feel the length of this game ensures it doesn't overstay it's welcome. I strongly recommend grabbing this when it's on sale.			",437,80,10,24,22,8,27

												Fun little puzzle (sort of, I guess?) / platforming game. It's a good game for the price (and a steal at 19c as of this review). I mean, come on, you get to use a teleport gun. My only complaint is that you can't change the keybinds of the 3 buttons this game has to any of the non-letter keys (at least, that's my experience). I wanted to map jump to space, but unfortunately, the game has a list of pre-set keybinds which the player can set.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a ""puzzle platformer."" While it also includes elements of a metroidvania (you collect 1 power-up to enable access to more of the zones, as well as a few health/ship powerups), I would prefer to compare the game to VVVVVV, Cave Story, and Portal 2.The sounds and graphics are throwbacks to Nintendo/Super Nintendo era, which is more than adequate for a 2d ""pixel-perfect"" platformer. As you play you are slowly taught the many tricks to beating this game. However, excepting the gun upgrade, you can perform all of those tricks from the very beginning (and have to for some of the hidden treasures). There is a story, but it is intentionally ignorable. This game is about puzzle-platforming.Play control is super-tight. Any errors made are completely your fault.The biggest drawback to the game is its length. It is extremely short (a speedrun of the game should take you between 12-20 minutes). This isn't necessarily a negative--there are only so many ways to do the same kind of puzzle before it becomes tedious, and the game avoids that by not padding the game out.			",314,74,4,58,20,1,43

Wasn't expecting much from the other games because retro platformers have been done to death and aren't really my thing.  To my surprise, this game turned out to be the real reason to buy the bundle.  It is stylin'.  Mechanically, it's like a 2D Portal with a little metroidvania and bullet hell thrown in.  It's short, but highly challenging and satisfying, with enough hidden goodies to make it worth doing an achievement run after clearing it once.			",342,170,8,99,29,5,60

												I bought this game for 0,19€ during sales and I feel like I stole the game.The game's quality is well worth it's price (4,99€)^^. Review (SPOILERS!!)Graphics-The graphics are pixelated and are really nice to look at.They kinda remind me of Cave Story ^^. Gameplay-The gameplay is really interesting.You have a ship during the opening section and it's kinda like those arcade space shooters where you go up and down and shoot things that are coming infront of you.After the first short ship section is over you are able to walk on the ground, you have a portal gun but it's nothing like the one from ,,Portal series"" more like a Teleport gun. The teleport gun teleports you when the projectile hit's a wall or something else and it makes for some pretty clever ways to pass trough an obstacle. You can find a gun at some point an you can kill enemies with it. There are hidden ship parts an heart containers, the ship parts can be used to upgrade your ship for the final boss battle and the heart containers to make you capable of taking more hits before kicking the bucket. There are only 2 ship sections in the game and they are : Introduction section and final boss ^^. Story-The story is very simple, your space ship is under attack by a notorious villain called Grigori and at the first ship part of the game your ship gets damaged and you crash on an unknown planet. You (the captain of the ship) need to repair your ship and catch Grigori.Grigori is finally defeated by the end of the game or is he?Maybe he is still ,, Out There Somewhere"" Pros +Stage Design.                                        +Music suits                                   the game                                    perfectly.+Good cutscene Art.+Responsive controls.+Fluid sprite animation.+More than one wayto complete the game.+Cards are easy to get.Cons-Kinda Short.-Some music tracksare forgettable.-,,But How?""

If their is i would buy it, I think dev should think about making either multiple planets in either an update, DLC or sequel as i was hoping their would be more then one planet but still worth your time and money!

												Ignore anyone saying this is not a good game, For they are F4GG0T5.Great little platformer harkening back to the days of commander keen, cave story and other similar otherwordly 2d jump and fight festivals.Really nice mechanics, smooth and fair gameplay and some puzzles that (while not being particularly challenging) are interesting and fun enough to keep you interested until the end. It is NOT a long game but I think this almost works in its favour. I think something like this would get irksome/annoying if they focused much more on timed jumping and awkward, multi-stage puzzles which I suppose they'd have to do to ramp up the difficulty any further.As it is the challenge is pleasant, it's fun to look for the extra secrets and (I thought) the game had a nice atmosphere. Perhaps it's not everyones cup of tea and if you're a resolutely modern (F4G1T) gamer then this might not please you but if you like to do more with your gaming time than endless games of CS:GO whilst pulling at your pants and screaming obscenities down the mic then this might well be something you'll enjoy.I was gifted the game but I believe it was really cheap lately and would definitely have been worth that price but I'd say, also, that at full price it's still a worthwhile investment. There's a fair chunk of replayability and I think it's sensible to support people making games like this as it's the textbook definition (to me) of ""A fun game"". There are just under 1000 games in my steam library, 90% of which I have NEVER played. I played this solidly until completion.Then I completed it again.10/10 kept my mind busy and gave me no desire to pull at my pants or scream down a microphone. It doesn't even HAVE mic support.

												(8/10)Cute little game thats a fusion of the various games it mentions in its blurb.  The music/graphics are very reminiscent of cave story, as are the very tight controls.  The main game is an exploratory metroidvania style, with a few secrets and some definite portalish puzzle solving.The various elements gel very well together and the overall play was fun and engaging, while it lasted.  I'm not normally a 'time snob' but it definitely felt like the game was over all too soon.  Aiding that was the notion that there was never really a chance to go back and grab all those secrets you saw glimpses of earlier.  If you miss it, odds are, you missed it, and thats that.I may actually do a second walkthrough enhanced run just to see what effects some of the last things i didn't do would have, but as it stands if you mostly just do forward progress you can probably beat it in just an hour or two.  (some kinda plus mode, or just some oportunity to 'turn back' at the end so you could finish collecting would have been appreciated).As it stands though I did like it, and did have fun, and would reccomend it specifically to cave story fans who also like puzzle games because more than anything else this is a great fusion of those two styles.

												Man, what a neat little game. It's unfortunately rather short, which is about the only bad thing I could say about it. The game's mostly based around the teleportation gun mechanic, which lends itself well to a lot of neat puzzles and platforming. Momentum is conserved through jumping so you can use it to gain extra height on a jump and get places you otherwise wouldn't be able to. Even in the small game world there's a ton of secrets tucked away and collecting them all does give you a health boost (and ship boost at the end of the game). It's really quite fun and the game does a lot even with its short length to keep things varied and interesting. The final boss is a bit weak/simplistic, I suppose, but the level design is great throughout to make up for it. Considering that it's currently $.19 USD on steam right now, there's no real excuse not to pick this one up and give it a shot.			",279,227,3,13,13,4,26

												Dunno what it is about the game, but i liked it instantly.Must be something about the way the game was designed and presented. It doesn't waste any time with overlong exposure and gets right down to the good stuff, mainly controls, animations and characters. The tiles aren't the prettiest though i wouldn't call the game ugly by any means. Animations and music give it a very good athmosphere.It focuses less on action, combat or powerups, and more on puzzles with a healthy serving of platforming. Climb everything and explore everywhere! It somewhat resembles Cave Story, but with fewer monsters (at least initialy) and less fighting. It has it's share of cutesy aliens and quirky characters, though the stories cannot be compared.The only downside is that there's no difficulty options and that it's not a very long game. I finished it in about an hour, but i enjoyed it. It's not brutaly easy but it's quite forgiving, which could be a good thing if you rage easily.I don't know why you're not playing this game. It's mix of puzzles and platforming requires some skill and feels rewarding. I'll admit that it doesn't look like a winner just by looking at the trailer & screenshots, but it's solid.Yes, recommended.			",70,24,8,13,26,0,19

												Out There Somewhere is an absolutely charming platformer that I highly recommend as an essential addition to any Steam user's library.  Much like Shovel Knight or Momodora, this is a modern game that looks and plays like one of the classics.The game's hero is a fighter pilot who is shot down during an epic space battle.  After crash-landing on a volcanic planet populated with friendly talking snails and strange tree-men, he ventures off, armed with a teleportation gun, to repair the ship and rejoin the battle.  Along the way, there's a few health upgrades and maybe even a weapon or two to help survive the baddies; there's also 11 hidden ship upgrades to find.While the platforming elements and the game's retro aesthetic are both great, the real star of the show is the teleportation mechanic.  Your primary trigger fires a slow-moving bolt of energy that instantly transports your character to the point of contact when a surface is struck.  Using this competently is necessary for getting through the game.  The really exciting bit, though, is the teleportation gun conserves momentum, just like Portal; beginning a leap just before your energy bolt hits something, for instance, means you'll still be traveling upwards after being teleported.  Mastering this makes for very satisfying gameplay, and abusing this mechanic to go as high or as far as you possibly can also lead you to secret areas or shortcuts that you wouldn't otherwise find. This game isn't very long, and while it's not a total cakewalk, the level of challenge is relatively low.  My first playthrough took about 90 minutes, and that was with a lot of optional exploration and puzzle-solving.  My second playthrough was a 100% playthrough, and took a little over an hour.  After learning the game's layout and mechanics, a speedrun will take not much more than 15 minutes.However, while not long, this game is really quite fun, and totally worth the very reasonable asking price.  Give it a shot, you won't regret it. ",154,112,2,28,17,3,20

The Story	Humanity is in peril, Allies receives a signal that the notorious villain Grigori is attacking again and decide to call Yuri - our hero for help.As he sets out to fight Grigori, his ship gets destroyed and he sees Grigori landing on an unknown planet and he decides to follow him without any other choice since he crashes on the planet.As soon as our hero lands he sees that Grigori has imprisoned the intelligent life on this planet.          He must free the planet's citizens, find a power source to get his ship to work again and defeat Grigori for good. Gameplay	The game revolves mostly around teleporting which is done via your teleporting gun (It's nothing like portal's portal gun).You get teleported the moment your bullet hits a wall and you depending on your timing you can jump after teleporting which can help you reach otherwise unreachable locations and it makes up for really clever platforming.The movement and shooting once you obtain your Gauss gun really remind me of Cave Story which is a good thing.You can also collect 3 Alien artifacts with each one making you more durable to damage.

												A very fun, if not very short, game. I picked it up during the Halloween Sale and it was mere cents, but I certainly got more than what I paid for.While it may not have the length or lasting power of other indie games, what Out There Somewhere does have is a fun teleporting mechanic similar to Portal. Unlike Portal, however, you can teleport basically anywhere you can think of, leading to a bunch of fun exploration and discovery. The game never slows down, either, leading to puzzles always being a matter of reflexes and wit rather than bland repetition like some...other indie games.Overall, Id love to see more of this kind of gameplay from the developers, and give Out There Somewhere a solid 7.5/10			",136,23,1,40,14,1,28

												Are you nervous it's gonna be bad? Well read this! It's a really fun game for me! But maybe it's not for you....idkFor those people who like platformers mixed with Portal and Super Mario (like me) then definitely buy this game! That price for so good 8-bit music and an RPG/Platformer that is very fun is unheard of! And it's so addictive, I LOVE IT! Gameplay is a bit short but come on. Everybody knows it takes a while to make a game! If you loved Portal and played it every single day but you got bored because you finished the game, or if you missed the good old days when Super Mario was a big thing, or do you just miss amazing, fricking awesome space games, or do you just wanna play a really good platformer? Then i highly recommend this game! Don't have any money? Just ask your parents! It's really cheap!Final words:A good game for many people. It's very addictive. It's great!9,7/10			",14,0,0,1,1,1,1

												Short but sweet and easy on the wallet. If you want a game you can beat around 1h then this is a game for you. The game have you explore an alien planet where you need to locate a new power source so you can get away from the planet. The main focus of the game is exploration and teleporation and both goes hand in hand rather well. Defenately something you need to play for yourself if you enjoy indie developed games.

												I got it only because the cards, and it was on 90% sale. I usually don't like platformers. However, this was quite decent, so I guess I could say it's pretty good, if you like platform games. I only managed to play couple of levels, until it got too frustrating for me. Well, I still got few achievements, cards, and a new game for my collection for a nominal price.			",75,53,1,11,7,0,10

												Graphics - 9/10, fit this game 100% perfectly. It is pleasing to look at but it can be too dark even with your brightness all the way up. If they just did a lighting overhaul it would go a long way.Story - 6/10, there isn't really a whole lot of story to this game. Basically you are on a space ship when aliens attack it, so naturally you go and fight them. You are overwhelmed and crash into an alien planet. You need to find a power core to get of the planet. During the game you hear from a few different NPC's that Grigori is a monster and they wish he wasn’t around, you also hear also hear he has that power core you need. So you take off on a mission to kill Grigori and get the power core.Gameplay - 9/10, while I want to say that this game has perfect gameplay, I can't. I personally feel that the beginning and ending space battles are unnecessary; I feel these two scenes are completely different from the rest of the game. Every other part of the game is plat-forming genius but then you have these button mashing sequences basically.Soundtrack - 8/10, I like the soundtrack this game has but I prefer to listen to my own music while I play because I'm personally not a huge fan of the ""Classic Pixel Style"" this game uses. But I do recognize that this a very well done soundtrack and I consider it worth having in my iTunes library.Overall - 32/40, even though I only have a short amount of time on this game as I am writing this (Currently 8 hours or so) I plan to add a lot more because I love this game. It is really addictive and I really recommend you buy it. I think it's worth full price but I imagine quite a few people would want to buy it when its on sale because it is so short.

												For a game that's cost as little as 19 cents on sale, it's a gem.I really wish it were longer. I mean, to be frank I would have never tried the game if it were more than a buck, but now that I have, I'd gladly buy some dlc that was more expensive than the game itself. Cut out the shmup and just make a whole game out of the teleport mechanic puzzle platforming and I'd play the hell out of that.			",132,22,0,8,10,3,2

												FANTASTIC game for the modest price. Novel and fun concept. Nice pixel art. Cool main character. Ocassional humour. Included is the soundtrack which is a work of art in it's own right. One of the best '8 bit style' soundtracks I've ever heardShort game (1-2 hours depending if you get stuck on any levels). Slightly unbalanced: generally slow paced puzzle levels followed by an insanely challenging and hectic space shooter boss (I had one health left for the finale and the game isn't very friendly with 'back tracking'I would love to see future games featuring Yuri and Grigori :)			",184,41,9,14,18,2,19

Can't even map spacebar to jump.  * Combat is repetitive and feels like an afterthought  * Incredibly short, ~1hr.			",99,16,0,4,9,0,7

												Not bad, but not memorable. The teleporting mechanic itself is unique, but the overall game feels all too familiar for those who played many puzzle-platformers. If you haven't played a lot of games from this genre, it may seem all new and exciting to you, but there are gems out there, somewhere, that deserve more your attention; if you are a veteran, I recommand it if you can never get enough of this kind of game.

												Oh, this game. Let's think this game first. This game is really hard, really annoying and really frustrating.  Teleport laser is very hard to handle, because later on the game, you need to do double jump with teleport gun and take like 5 minutes to pass one double jump sections. Also this game have so many dead traps. I ragequit several times during this game, because that stupid teleport laser. But I still recommend this game? Why?  Music is kinda good, maybe sometimes annoying, but good. Levels are well done, expect double jumping. Story is also pretty good (I haven't finish game before this review). Pros:+ Good music+ Nice level design+ Very low cost (19 cents)+ Story+ Aliens look hilariousCons:- Rage game elements- Teleport Gun- Double Jumping- Hard platformingI bought this game from sale. This game is annoying and still pretty good, but if it wasn't in the sale, it's not worth it. Also game is very quick, you can see credits after 2 hours.6/10			",112,2,7,13,9,1,16

												I got this game in a bundle of bundles of games I have yet to play. Looked like some dumb arcade shooter when I first started playing (mind you, I didn't view the store page.). Nothing special. When I lost all my hearts for the first time in my ship, i was almost relieved to have a reason to stop playing. Looked boring. But then.Dialogue appeared after I got shot down. The game wasn't over. It was actually only beginning. I was mesmerized by the fact that it went from an arcade space shooter to a 2d puzzle game. And it fit into storyline. Absolutely amazing. So much fun. Would recommend.			",67,7,0,4,3,0,1

												I recommend it for people who like a good platformer game with an awesome soundtrack.Completed it in my first playthrough, wish it was longer, got ~50% of the acheivements, plan on getting them all.Recommend playing it with a controller, you don't need an expensive and fancy one, a D-pad and 4 buttons is all you need.Pros:+ Nice and inovating platforming mechanics;+ Killer music;+ Delightful pixel graphics;+ Cheap;+ You can replay it and it doesn't get boring because there's a lot of acheivements;+ A good challenge. (some people like their games hard-ish)Cons:- A good challenge; (some people like their games easy)- Too short;- Spaceship segments feel kinda out-of-place.- Way too short.I'd like to congratulate the developers for making such a nice game, and I hope they come out with a sequel for this, cause Grigori is still ""Out There Somewhere"".

												This game is very interesting.The story is about a space cop who is hunting a villain named Grigori. But after a fight with him, his space ship gets badly damaged and both land on a same planet. Main gameplay begins here and you have to find a light orb to fix your ship and defeat Grigori for good.Gameplay is really nice. you have a teleport gun which is frequently used in the game and nearly all of the puzzles must be solved with it and a gauss gun to kill enemies. After progressing further in the game, you will encounter new enemies, three types of lightbeams, mirrors, breakable objects and moving platforms which add to the challenge.PROS:- Nice gameplay- Great soundtrack- Collectables affect how much hard the last fight will be- Can 100% the game easily with a little skill and patienceCONS:- Short (Can be completed in 14 mins to 75 mins on first playthrough)- You HAVE to lose in the first encounter with Grigori and you can even lose at the beginning; but it's not clear. So you do your best to take him down and after a lot of minutes you find out it was a complete waste of time.- Some rare achivement problems: One of the achievement did not unlock until I did it's required action for the third time.VERDICT:This game is really nice and definitely worths trying but it's short and after you unlock every achievement, you may not want to play it anymore.

												Normally dont write reviews but had to say that this game was so laggy to the extreme that i could not time anything whatsoever, and for the record my ram is at 30% so its not that. Aesthetically this game is great, the music is repetitive and annoying in contrast to the music from its trailer wich was nice. Shame. Atleast it was just 20 cents :P			",17,5,0,7,0,0,0

												This is a short but excellent puzzle platforming adventure. It takes about the length of time a ""chapter"" might take in a longer game, so somewhere in the ballpark of an hour if you're going at a relaxed, casual pace. (There is an achievement for 20-minute completion for speedrunners.)Figuring out how to use the teleportation gun to solve each room---as well as discover secrets for the more observant---is very satisfying both to solve and to execute.There isn't much of a story here, but I don't think you'll care about that too much. What the game lacks in story, it makes up for in charm and style. It definitely has that nice Cave Story / Metroid kinda vibe that SNES era kids will love.I also got it on sale for NINETEEN CENTS?! That is a f***ing steal.			",216,124,3,41,18,0,24

												Out There Somewhere is a platformer/puzzle game with bullet hell stages, with mechanics that resemble Portal.It's a very fun little game that, despite being very short (~2-3h of gameplay, maybe 4 if you want all achievements) is very entertaining and will keep you stuck to the computer until you beat it.PROS: Beautiful pixel graphics Funny and simple storyline Very rewarding to figure out how to pass certain levelsCONS: Short Game Storyline is not too deep, you won't get very attached to the characters Those who do not enjoy Bullet Hell (or are bad at it) will suffer at a couple points I died so many times at the final boss it gives me nightmares til todayFinal Score: 4/5Very fun little game, extremely worth its price tag. Highly recommend anyone who enjoys platformers/puzzle games to grab this. Sell some items or cards on the Market and grab it. It's totally worth it.			",66,11,1,5,7,1,10

												I found Out There Somewhere to be very boring. Beyond the puzzle solving this game does almost nothing to pull you in. The puzzles are decent, requiring quick reactions. The teleportation gun is an interesting mechanic, and has a lot of potential, but I just don't care enough to go slogging through the rest of the game to get to this theoretical point of interest.The story may as well not be there, as it does nothing to intrigue the player beyond giving a background to the puzzles to come.I don't recommend this game unless you have a keen interest in 2d puzzle platformers, as well as a lack of interest in compelling story telling.

												A better Cave Story than Cave Story. While there's less story than in CS, I think it works in this type of games' favor. It's challenging, but not overly frustrating. The mechanics expand on the run-and-gun formula and add some more interest. Worth a try if you liked CS even a little bit, and you might even end up liking it better, like I did.

												Bought the game thinking it was a metroidvania game with light puzzle elements, found out that it was a reflex based puzzle platformer with some 2d shooter elements.  And even though I bought it on sale (for about 17 cents) I would not recommand this title. Its short, the puzzles are nearly all reflex based, the story is paper thin, the gameplay is slugish, and it discourages back tracking.			",244,83,1,35,26,4,61

Out there somewhere is a very cheap platformer game, and in this case you get nothing more than what you paid for. A bland, uninspired jumpfest. The game consists of you having to perform tricky jump after tricky jump until the end credits roll. Out there somewhere claims to be ""Inspired by Cave Story, Super Metroid, and Portal,"" I don't see it - at all. I'd call it a lie in an attempt to boost sales, but there's nothing wrong with saying what inspired you, I guess. A satanic death metal band could claim the inspiration for their latest album was the Beatles' white album, even though you'd never actually hear that influence in any of their music.Apparently, if you're good at this sort of game, you'll finish Out there somewhere in less than an hour and are entitled to some bragging, for example in the form of the Steam Achievement for finishing the game. If you're not particularly good at this sort of game, you'll notice they managed to make 'Out there somewhere' very challenging (difficult) but forgot to add any fun or wonder to the gameplay, which would motivate to try and finish it anyway.All in all, Out there somewhere  is a below average platformer that's only for the die-hard platformer gamer who's looking for a quick but extremely difficult fix.

Pretty fun game, would get paid 1 cent to play it again.It's a short game but the platforming is quite fun. The teleport gun is a clever mechanic and the game makes good use of it with some fair but challenging sections. After I beat it once I was still motivated enough to replay it several more times for full completion. Definitely a worthwhile purchase.			",132,28,0,10,6,1,13

Sometimes a little confusing where you need to be, but generally just moving right occasionally deviating to go down side paths gets you to where you need to be. The Sound track is nice and enemys are simple yet provide a decent obstacle. Design overall is very nice. 10/10 wish it was longer :)			",439,116,11,34,32,2,53

												It's $1 for a puzzle-platformer that'll probably last about an hour on your first go, has above-average pixel graphics and a pretty killer soundtrack, and a handful of pretty darn well-hidden trinkets. My only real objection is that said trinkets only serve to make the final boss even more of a cakewalk if you collect enough of them. Good deal!			",611,127,18,38,40,4,51

												Fun, quick puzle side scroller game. Smooth gameplay, with the teleport gun puzzles being fast paced and intricate keeping it enjoyable. Sometimes a little confusing where you need to be, but generally just moving right occasionally deviating to go down side paths gets you to where you need to be. The Sound track is nice and enemys are simple yet provide a decent obstacle. Design overall is very nice. 10/10 wish it was longer :)			",439,116,11,34,32,2,53

Great game ! The gameplay is not really original, but it fits perfectly with the universe and there's a real job of level design.A little too simple in my opinion (Yo can do MUCH harder with this type of gameplay).Finally I would say some Mods to add more levels could be awesome ! :)I completely recommend you this game !

												(Review writed with 7.6 hours gaming and all achievements unlocked - Jan 01st, 2017).Out There Somewhere is a 8-bit portal game with a little of space invaders. You play with a space pilot who's crashlanded on an alien world, and you've found yourself inside a retro-tinged platformer in which each room works as a single puzzle, all to repair your spaceship. Pros:- Challenging puzzles;- Nice 8-bit portal game play.Cons:	- Few levels;- Lame history;- Few boring challenges;- Hard achievements.6,0/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Out There Somewhere is a clever game that's just all around quite humble and enjoyable to play. The platforming handles well, there's little secret areas throughout that still feel rewarding to find yet aren't too impossibly hidden, and it's got a short and sweet story. Game runs a little short (only took a few hours to 100% all the achievements), but the satisfaction from finishing the game justifies the price.			",165,33,5,25,18,0,23

												Very nice platformer with an interesting game mechanic.You play as a captain of a space ship who ends up in a fight with a villain named Grigori (who is still out there somewhere btw)It result in your ship crashing on some alien planet. Now you have to find your way through the planet to get a light orb to fix your spaceship (Every spaceship needs light orbs cause you know... reasons...) and optionally collecting ""abandoned cores"". You have a teleport gun which teleports you to where the shot lands... a cool game mechanic that is very well implemented.Pros:-Figuring out how to get to the end of every screen is a lot of fun.-Timing and thought required make it enjoyable.-Short but not too short.-Tight controls.-Good soundtrack.-Good-looking pixel graphics.Cons:-Almost no story. (doesn't really matter for this kind of game ... use your Imagination)Highly Recommended!			",82,11,4,5,4,0,6

												Kind of like a 2D Portal. It has fun platforming with a unique twist, while still being a challenge. You use a portal gun to propel yourself higher and make jumps that would make Mario jealous. Colorful world and great graphics, it fits in nicely with the space theme. It can get tedious at times, but once you get the mechanics down you'll be swinging in no time. The music is great and goes well with the rest of the game. Overall a very fun challenge that will give your fingers a workout. Definately worth two dollars.			",36,4,0,4,4,1,3

												This game was very good, however there a few things to note if you wnat to get it, i spent about 5 1/2 doing puzzles to beat this game, then a faught a boss using some of the skills i learned before, then i faught a space ship using absoultly no prior skills after spending 5 1/2 hours i had to fight in an new way that was way to difficulthowever if your stuck on the last boss, the best way to win is use a controller,also mash the fire button so you shoot faster, i failed my first 30+ tries and won my first try with a controlleroverall this is a fantastic puzzle game however there is no point to collecting cores, once you get them all you need to backtrack to some dude to upgrade them? waste of time			",107,24,0,15,9,1,3

												Even though the mechanics in this game are completely different from VVVVVV, I would recommend this to fans of VVVVVV in a heartbeat. Static screens, tricky but not impossible jumping puzzles, and kickass chiptune music.Don't be fooled by the absolutely horrid SHMUP opening - this is one of the better indie platformers of 2016, and at a VERY reasonable price, to boot. It harkens back to an era of Steam where indie games weren't all overpriced Early Access games or tedious RPGMaker clones.			",417,119,19,45,80,10,93

												When I bought - I thought , looks stupid and boring. After playing 2 minutes, I loved the music and how it matched with the game. The way you teleport is just amazing!!! BUY IT QUICKLY if you think you might be interested! Won't hurt to try since you can try for a refund. Just started playing for 5 minutes and I already like , and maybe so will you :D- LOL , I was going to post my review , but it said I must have been at least playing it for 5 minutes :You need to have used this product for at least 5 minutes before posting a review for it (1 minutes on record).

												MINOR SPOILERS FOLLOWThis game isn't long, but that doesn't matter, because it is a well-constructed game.  Initially, you begin with a side-scrolling space-shooter sequence that takes you through an army of rival space ships.  After the initial boss fight (which you are supposed to lose), you begin exploring a planet armed initially with only a portal gun.  You'll find an actual weapon later on to fight enemies with and to help with solving puzzles.The game is basically an action-platformer in the vein of games like Metroid with its exploration for various items, including extenders to your life meter and components which can power-up your repaired ship at the end of the game.  There aren't a whole lot of mechanics to the game, which is fitting for its short length.  This also makes the game easy to pick up and play.  There is a good challenge to the later sections, but there is nothing that truly feels overwhelming or unfair, which is a testament to the overall game design.  The price is fair as there is replayability to earn achievements.  For such a short title, there is a fairly large number to attain, and I can see people earning all of them with lots of practice.I can find very little to criticize about this game.  You do have to be careful of scene switches because you can walk and/or jump into a hazard without fully realizing it, similar to Castle in the Darkness, though not nearly as unfair as in the latter title.  Also, in some of the vertical sections, I had to stop and search for my character, who was just about as far down the screen as possible, usually in a corner!  A brief, flashing arrow pointing to your character would help here, but this is not a big criticism.  It's possible to solve every room on the first try if you're observant and careful; I can even see a few people maybe having a deathless run on the first playthrough.Out There Somewhere has just the right length for casual gamers while being robust enough for those looking for a challenge, especially those seeking to 100% the game through both winning and through completing the achievements.  I highly recommend this game.  It is both well-crafted and extremely well balanced.  Buy it!9.0 / 10			",287,49,0,39,2,0,6

												Makes you think to solve puzzles. Gets a thumbs up because that part is done well. It was worth about the 19 cents I paid for the 20-30 minutes of playtime I put into it. I won't be playing it anymore because I was just too bored. Probably the horrible atari colors they used for the graphics that make me want to go on a shooting rampage in a bong shop full of hipsters.			",598,87,12,48,22,5,43

												Basically, it's a demo.  The game has unique gameplay elements and all; but it's extremely short and linear, running you through a token tutorial for about 20 minutes to show off the engine.  Think like the Final Fantasy 8 demo being released as a full game, or if Super Metroid ended when you beat the Bomb Torizo.Really not a lot of thought put into it.  Glaringly little thought put into world and scenario.			",83,14,1,8,4,0,1

												It's a lovely little game rather let down by the developer getting FAR FAR too interested in how fiddly and precise they could make some of the platforming.The teleport gun is an interesting idea but it's just a BIT too fiddly and a BIT too depenent on precision (luck) to be any fun.Some people will like that but I found it tiresome - a lot of the time you'll get through stuff as much by repetition as skill - I just lost interest...

												This game was so promising, and I sat down expecting a sweet metroidvania style platform puzzler. I played it for 30 minutes, and took a break to get some food. Then I sat down again and realized I was just outside the chamber of the first boss. ""Great"", I thought, a boss battle is always nice. So I went ahead and defeated the boss in about five minutes. Then the game ended... WHAT!? 35 minutes of gameplay, and ONE boss? Really?I realize this game is only 5€, and you can't expect much from a game that cheap, but still, 35 minutes of content just isn't enough for me to recommend this game.If you still need to kill half an hour and like platform puzzlers with a wee bit of skill needed, then by all means, this game is for you.

												I normally try to make well-written reviews, but due to this game's slow performance I'm not even able to play it.I got it on a sale really cheap, so I don't really mind wasting a couple coins in it, but the hardware requirements this game has written are totally false, my computer meets them but the game still runs horribly slow.The worse part is that the game doesn't even have complex graphics, I'm able to run games like OpenArena, Minecraft and other games at 60 FPS at some points, this games goes like at 5 FPS and the graphics are just horrible simple.Also, the game lacks options to disable graphic effects or anything else, the only graphic option is to toggle fullscreen.

												*Extremely minor spoiler alert.*I really wanted to like this game.  However, 2 minutes into the game you'll face an unbeatable boss.  I learned this after another 5 minutes of mashing the fire button and dodging attacks.  I didn't even get to the real game, and now I don't even want to.Devs, if you want to blow up my ship, that's fine.  Make it a scripted event, or give the enemy an unavoidable attack.  Don't waste my time, and don't make me do something that feels stupid.  Having to intentionally destroy my ship completely breaks immersion and removes all my motivation for continuing.

But the game started to grow on me, the art style was pleasant, and the music is surprisngly well done. The mechanics of the game are simple, but fun and intuitive. The gameplay revolves around a gun which, when fired, fires a bolt which you teleport to when it collides with something. The puzzles designed around this are quite clever, and the game introduces more puzzle mechanics that spice up an already interesting style. It was getting interesting. And just as I felt as though the game was going to advance into something better, it ended. Now, I purchased this game for twenty cents, but it runs for five dollars normally. And because of this, I ultimately cannot recommend Out There Somewhere, as the game time is abyssmally short for the asking price, and honestly left me dissatisfied. I was able to beat the game in under an hour and a half. That sucks. The gameplay itself is enjoyable, but it feels more like a Flash game in the end.			",214,43,1,18,10,2,18

												Even at the cost of 0.21 ( I bought it on a 96 % sale) this game is hardly worth it.  Poor game design overall.  The first phase of the final boss has no challenge and is just plain simple while the second half is more fun but lasted only 15 seconds....When you start the game, you're in a ship and you fight an ennemy boss ship that looks like it's taking damage from your shots BUT NO, you actually have to commit suicide for the game to begin.  So, I lasted 5 minutes shooting an invincible boss while dodging his bullets, laser and missiles until my friend told me I HAD TO DIE for the game to begin.  This is wrong on so many levels...  Also, during the entire game, never once have I been puzzled by a certain room and I finished the game in 42 minutes (playtime).  This is not worth more than 21 centsThe only thing redeeming this game  is the soundtrack and the pixel art...			",94,3,1,7,1,0,1

												I was surprised to see this game on sale for less than $0.50... but given the playtime, I'd say that's about right. The game is fun and has some creative puzzles, but you can easily beat it in less than one hour on your first try. I guess if it goes under a dollar again it's worth an hour of your time.

												I’m still on the fence with this game, but I can not bring myself to play it anymore. It teases with the start being a classic arcade space scroller, but instantly turns into a puzzle platformer. Non of that is bad, it just threw me right from the start and made me crave a style of game that I wasn’t going to receive for a long time. The sorry excuse for puzzles and the interesting weapon/ game mechanics are the only thing that almost save this game, but in the end the tediousness of the controls and gameplay force it into the bad game category. It is an interesting concept, but one that was poorly executed. If you like slow games that are solely based on timing, this is for you.			",106,14,0,14,7,0,16

												For the sale price it wasn't bad.  For full asking price, I can't see how you could justify it.The mechanics are decent, there are a couple puzzles that let you do some cool things.My  big issue is how linear it felt along with being so short.  I would have enjoyed exploring a bit more, but some areas were restrictive to that, and once you get to the end there is no way to backtrack to before it from what I can tell.  I'm not gonna start another playthrough to find evreything, now I'm just annoyed :(			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It really hurts me to not recommend this game...Because when you look at it, it is very pretty, the gameplay is smooth, and all the art design (atmosphere, sounds, story...) is very nice and thought.But... it is much too short, and quite unsatisfying in terms of experience. It is definitely a flaw in games these years, although some others would argue it is a plus. Yet for me, such a small contribution in terms of entertainment and gaming is exactly like with toys and games... a diminished version, a raw skeleton without any flesh or organs.In other words? The type of gamer I am can not feel fully satisfied with what feels like a demo, like a ""short story"" of a gameplay mechanic. Please realize I am not asking for a 100hours long rpg, but this ""little gamish piece of art"" would have been great if there was more substance to it, more body. As is, I feel sorry to say that I can not recommend it...			",455,114,10,98,23,4,73

												Playing on a Mac here, if that makes any difference.I'm sure it would be fun if my controls worked half of the time I played the game. The first time I launched it, the escape button didnt work, so i coulnt bring up the menu, but i troopered through. Once I completed the Galaga section, I landed on the planet. No story text popped up, no hints, nothing. ""Okay, maybe there's not supposed to be anything here."" I play around with the controls and learn them, since my escape button doesnt work. Controls learned, time to move on. I go to the right, since nothing is blocking my way, and nothing happens. Screen doesnt change to the next area or anything. ""This is really, really weird. Let me restart the game."" Alright, restarted the game and it puts me on the planet, just after Galaga. I get story text and hints this time, and my escape button works! Awesome. I move right, and then the screen changes. Fantastic! Game is going good...until I have to shoot my teleport gun. ""What the heck?"" I press X multiple times and no response. ""Dangit. Gotta restart again."" Restart game, game works in all aspects. Gameplay was alright, I guess. I think it tried to be too much like Risk of Rain, a game I highly reccomend, in both the controls and the overall feel of the game.  But for the technical problems I had, I cant reccomend Out There Somewhere.			",31,2,0,5,3,0,1

												Out There Somewhere is not a great Steam game, but would be right at home on a Flash website.The opening feels like a student's first Multimedia Fusion game after following a tutorial on how to make a space shooter.  Staticky sound effects, zero enemy variety, unnatural parallax scrolling, no interesting visual effects... It's pretty amateurish and gave me a poor first impression.As the game progressed, I was pleased that it has some originality, and it's reasonably satisfying to jump around and teleport from place to place.  In the game's cleverer moments, it does a good job introducing new mechanics and ideas.It was over in less than an hour.  I was expecting the game to go on for quite a bit longer, considering it hadn't expanded upon the teleport-gun mechanic all that much, and I was still seeing the same three enemies.  I never spent a full five minutes in any one room, and I know that because several of the Steam achievements I didn't get reward being slow.  I'm sure there were some areas that I missed out on, but I don't care to go back to them, because it would mean going back through the unchallenging samey puzzles I already solved.I couldn't tell you what the plot of the game was, or how any of the music goes from memory, because none of it particularly stood out.  What I do remember is how irritating it was that the gun fired shots so slowly, and how enemies seemed to take more hits than necessary.  I remember discovering all the doors are needlessly one-way when I tried to check an earlier room and couldn't do it.  And I remember how closing a textbox had an awkward delayed reaction because I kept immediately reopening NPC dialog on accident.The way I see it, Out There Somewhere feels more like a prototype than a finished game.  There's very little diversity, no thought required, not enough polish, and even the visuals feel flat and artificial.  It's not bad, per se, but it's not great, and not something I'd recommend to my friends if they had to pay money for it.			",42,23,0,2,2,0,2

It is a really fun game for only 79p (default price) or as part of the Developer Alliance Bundle (4 games, this included for about £11) This is a really beautiful game with a wonderful soundtrack, but, it is easy to miss some important tips since most people tend to skip the chat boxes. Overall, i would recommend this game and hope that the achievements add to the replay value.			",64,3,0,1,10,0,5

												A short, but entertaining retro puzzle platformer.Actually it has retro graphic, which I dislike, but the fun gameplay mechanic - jumping, shooting, teleporting to solve puzzles make up for it. The gameplay basically is a platformer where you have to go through multiple rooms containing threats like aliens and lavas by utilizing your teleport gun and pistol. Some thinking and some fasthand are required, though it's not frustrating or hard like Super Meat Boy.Chiptune music is cheesy, but it's alright.It's in-arguably a bit short, though. Some people even have beaten the game in ten minutes or so, I did it in one hour. Well, forgive me. Game runs fine in my toaster laptop, 60 FPS straight.Controller support sucks, but at least I can remap my Dinput based controller F310 Logitech. It also has Steam Achievements (incentives for people who want to replay the game) and Trading Cards, good value overall.96% off at the moment - 0.20 USD equivalent, well worth every penny.Definitely recommended.

												A cute little platformer that reminds me of a 2D Portal. There's a lot going on here for the price. The game has a nice ramping difficulty, but none of the puzzles get so insane you won't be able to solve them. The soundtrack is awesome, and the artstyle is new-age retro, which is definitely up my alley. The combat (while not a major focus of the game) feels a little clunky, and there are some sections that seem like filler (not intutive level design) but a solid game overall.			",253,7,1,26,4,0,5

												Let me start out by saying this: There's no way I can do this game justice by a simple review.Good retro visuals, a good, catchy and well made soundtrack, perfectly responsive controls, a good and simple story, and high replayability are only a few of this game's qualities. Drawing clear inspiration from Pixel's work (Cave Story and its successors), Out There Somewhere manages to dish out the right amount of nostalgia, while being unique enough to earn its own place in Indie game history.The first playthrough will take about one hour, but with so many hidden secrets and alternate ways to complete the puzzles, I can almost guarantee you'll start a new game at least two more times.Truth be told, I've written and deleted at least three paragraphs trying to describe this game, and I still can't do it. My recomendation is simple: buy it and see for yourself.			",24,0,0,5,0,0,0

												To begin with I thought this game would be fun, because the look from the screenshots. But actually the game is just terrible, The only positive thing about the game is the artwork. Everything else in my eyes is just horrible , The levels are too complicated. Nothing makes any sense espcially the controlls of the storyline.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Platformer= Anger, sure I get it. :(  Warning: You'll need to watch a walkthrough or find a forum post  I've gotten stuck twice. Which isn't bad in itsef. The first time I was given a hint I didn't read, my bad. The second time on ""mirror wall"" there's no real hint on how to get past the puzzle. Finding the forum post get's harder with a title like ""mirror wall"", and finding a youtube video is even worse, as you have to watch like minutes to an hour to find the part you are stuck on.  :(    ControlsOn my Xbox controller there's a little lagg. This doesn't help with the precision the game requires. I have to wait .25 to jump. When preforming a teleport jump, I have to time this, I died a lot until I got the timing right. :) Basic gameplay Smooth, when working. The teleport gun works. Shooting and teleporting are very amazing. :) Level DesignIt's an amazing world. :) ArtThe reasson I bought this game. It's amazing. From enviroment to character, it's really some great pixel art work. Get it on sale. I did.    ",106,24,0,14,11,0,7

												Well, the first thing that met me when I started the game was a screen that wanted me to fill in an email address to get a 'free game', and the launch screen for Out There Somewhere didn't even start before I submitted an address. Then my antivirus gave an alarm about identity theft. After I let the antivirus fix the problem, the game itself finally started.The game itself is kinda nice, with innovative mechanics, but anyone trying to play this without some anti virus protection installed is probably royally screwed. Hence, I really, REALLY can't recommend it.An hour after I stopped playing it, the anti virus went off again. The game still tries to do something illegal in the background.Well, at least I got it for 0.02 euro.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A true Diamond in the rough.  With all of the nonsense getting through greenlight recently, it is nice to see an intelligent platformer that tests both your mind and dexterity skills, whilst managing a simple 'find the engine part' scenario after getting trapped on an unknown planet.  Things are kept nice and easy to begin with, but soon become more challenging as the game progresses.  Platforming is the genre type and the game benefits from responsive controls, good collision detection and audio feedback.Graphically - Nothing brilliant, but a competent throwback to the 8/16-bit days of the 90'sSound - Simple effects.  Nothing obnoxious - Once again, 8-bit styled around the PC engine eraDo I recommend?  I bought this for 19p on a sale and I have to tell you, it was a steal!  If you can get it for around £1 ($1.70) or less, you'll have a great little budget gem worthy of any retro-style platforming fan out there			",172,34,6,24,14,4,14

												A really neat little platformer that takes about 100 mins to complete the story of on my first go. As far as i can tell to 100% it you would also have to play a number of the levels in reverse as well to get all the collectable which i havent done. The main mechanic of this game is the teleportation system which is really cool, it allows for some really interesting puzzles that may require you to think about for a bit before you can complete them. In the same way Portal requires you to think with portals, this game requires you to think with perfectly timed teleportation. Would reccomend it at the normal price. So if its at 15p it totally worth it.			",148,22,14,5,30,1,13

At less than £1 it may be worth it but don't expect much. This is the kind of game you might find online in Flash for free.			",90,15,1,9,2,2,7

												So far this game is outstanding! The retro-style graphics and music make the game feel awesome, the gmaeplay is excellent, puzzles are definetly confusing but unique and fun!EDIT:Update! I finally beat the game! I played the 2nd half of the final boss stage (in space), and it took nearly an hour to finally beat him! This game was one of the best puzzle/platform games i've ever played. The maps were challanging and it took a while to get used to all the tactics, but it was worth it in the end! Outstanding game!

												It's a neat little game with some exploration. I finished it in a little bit less than an hour and had lots of fun with it. I'm sure I'll do another playthrough just to talk to some other aliens since the encounters can get funny from time to time. The puzzles are fun, they're not too hard but you will have to think out of the box from time to time. You should definitely give this game a try since it offers a good amount of fun for a rather cheap price.			",553,117,17,97,49,8,83

												Very short but amazing game, my first playthrough took me 40 min, then I replayed it twice to get achievements and collect all the items and card drops. A little bit demanding, but for experienced players shouldn't be too difficult. Controls feel very smooth. The only disadvantage is that it is short, but what would you expect from 1$ game.Conclusion: If you're low on cash, sell some cards and get it for 0,20$ on sale, if not just buy it, definitely recommended!

												This game is for those interested in speedrunning, looking at what your indie project could become, or a literal example of many game design teachings that stick out like a sore thumb. I would say that this game has its moments, but really, the game does nothing much to make itself have moments of impact.It's a metroidvania game that lacks bosses, powerups, or smart puzzles that offer diversity over difficulty. You'll get tired of it unless you enjoy games like the Witness for its puzzles alone. There's no climax other than getting minor upgrades or entering your ship for the final boss. There's no control of pacing aside from locking off features to your character. A new game+ mode would've really helped, where it lets you explore the game world past the final boss considering how the map makes a complete circuit but the game decides to be far too linear, and for that I think it fails.It's a short combination of megaman and portal without the gripping soundtrack, hardcore gameplay, or unique narrative. If you're a sucker for gameplay that doesn't dip in quality, then sure, pick this game up for the dollar (or 25 cents) it's worth. You get it's full worth for what you pay. It's a short, but mildly sweet experience. It's got cute character designs, neat gameplay designs, but when it comes to anything more than puzzle solving and waiting for monster cycles, it falls short. On the plus side, it's short, and easy to speedrun with the in-game timer mechanic.As far as minimally priced games go, this is one of the better ones, but you could always save up your money for a fantastic 10 dollar game over the short-lived ""experience"" of this one.

When an evil space warlord threatens mother planet, it's up to one ace pilot to take him down!  Until he fails and gets shot down to the surface.A puzzle platformer bookended with shoot-em-up gameplay turns out to be a enjoyable combination.  The well designed levels slowly ramp up the difficulty while teaching players new tricks to handle the growing complexity.  While not the longest game, it's paced well to not overstay it's welcome and leave a positive aftertaste.			",1292,572,45,182,173,17,247

Inventive unpretentious 2D platformer6/10 ★★★★★★☆☆☆☆Let's make 2 things clear - I do not fancy platform games (I am not a six-year-old) and I do not long for pixel art graphics (an insult to my GPU). Having said so, Out There Somewhere is both and I can't stop enjoying this game.Gameplay seemlessly joins skills and wits, thanks to one simple, but innovative machanics.This blends nicely to the world and the story, and turns the game into an unpretentious and surprisingly coherent adventure.Graphics is simple but ejoyable pixel art, fitting the the game idea. Audio is ok. This is a bugdet product and does not bring visual fireworks. And thanks to the great mechanics does not need any.Out There Somewhere came to me as a surprise. I did not expect much and, boy, how wasn't I prepared for so much fun!.Summing upWell-executed platformer with inventive gameplaypositive good idea for gameplay, well developed into mechanics good, upretentious execution good, pixel-art graphicsnegative just a 2D platformer  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯A little, budget gem. Highly recommended. ",53,7,2,3,2,0,2

												Speedrunner with a teleport jumping difficulty curve.(i'm not a big fan of this genre of gaming, so go easy on me. don't take this review to heart)This game goes from simple to annoyingly jumbled with little to no help along the way. Expect to be confused and a little frustrated from the beginning. I think that a more helpful tutorial should of been in place, especially for newer players and people who aren't familiar with speedrunners.Most of the levels are really easy, but a few in between are just plain hard, from jumping and teleporting with miliseconds of error to jumping and dodging enemies while firing teleport shots across the map, it ramps up really fast. You also have to repeat a lot of content if you mess up, which is often due to the quick timing required.Easy game to play, difficult to master.The game is really short, only lasting around 2-3 hours. The game is only 1$. Anyway, this is my short review on this game, I didn't like it but I had to give it a try. I hope this review does not upset you, it is simply my opinion.Personal Rating: 1/5			",84,36,2,21,13,0,16

												OMGLADYGG　ｗｔｆ!!!Ｉ ＣＡＮ＇ｔ ＳＴＡＮＤ　ＴＨＩＳ ＡＷＦＵＬ　ＧＡＭＥ　ＡＮＹＭＯＲＥ！！It's just waste my time spene too much time on it's front of levels.The game's Fluency is fu*kly bad to move with step by step,even some times just can't do anythings long time that only wait person to one direct move complete .I'm  addicted to the game's good review so that the game beat my little heart and little wallet.The game can't be better than my first  game to made by C language.Even though the game has a good idea but it's playability is too low.Maybe the reason is the game doesn't   adapt system of win10.But I have to make a bad review to warning future players.  If u have time to play the game,I think u should go to bed or study    =,=			",653,197,14,80,61,9,88

												Do yourself a favor and just get Cave Story.This game is too short and relies on a teleportation projectile for all the puzzles. Which is fine, if it were of any decent length. It can't take itself very seriously. There are mixed pixel ratio issues in some areas. There's only 3 minor enemies if you count the thwomp clones. It ramps up the challenge, but not enough to warrant someone's time or money.			",84,22,0,7,4,0,0

												I gave up on final boss as the difficulty spike proved too much for me and I haven't found the game engaging enough to try and overcome it. To the contrary of what it says on the Steam page, this game has nothing to do with Cave Story or Super Metroid. It's just a short puzzle platformer with an interesting mechanic. The teleport gun is fun and there were a couple of interesting puzzles, but overall the experience was unsatisfying.			",138,38,1,27,15,2,36

												I got this for free through a giveaway please note. The game overall is pretty fun once you get a hang of the mechanics and such. The maps and graphics are designed well and the soundtrack is very nice. Before you get the physics down the game can be very boring and frusterating but once you get the hang of it, the gameplay is very rewarding. The game is pretty short, about 2-3 hours depending on how good you are at thhe game and how fast you get used to the game mechanics. Although if you are an achievement hunter there is a lot of bonus stuff to do and a lot of secret areas. The game sometimes lags which usually doesn't botch you up but beware and the response time is pretty mediocre. I think the one thing that got me the most was the final boss battle. Note that the first level is a bullet hell shoot em' up but is very short and very easy. The rest of the game is a platformer, with portal esque mechanics. The boss battle is split into two sections, the first being a platformer in which you jump around bullet and teleport past lasers while shooting with your pistol. The second stage puts you into a scenario very much like the first stage but 10 times harder. I really do not like it when games boss battle are completely different to the core gameplay and all your experiance and skills gained throughought the game is completely thrown out the window. Although scattered throughout the core game there is little secret bonus items you can pick up to boost your damage during this level, this does little to improve the anti-climatic boss battle in the end. Overall the game is pretty fun, can be kind of frusterating but is a steal for the price (especially if you get the game and soundtrack for free), I give it a 7/10.			",133,17,1,11,26,1,16

												I don't think I can recommend this, I have to google almost every screen and there's nothing in between screens to make me WANT to progress other than to say I beat another game on my Steam list and now I never have to play it again. Well I realised that's not fun, and I stopped having fun with this game after about five minutes, no walkthrough anywhere is good, and I should just stop playing and uninstall a game that I'm not enjoying. I might have enjoyed watching an LP more, but I'm pretty sure I'll just be sour if I tried it nowIf there were decent walkthroughs, like youtube ones that covered what to do in every area, then put a table of contents with timestamps in the description, I would play this again. But if I have to keep googling areas [never before have I had to google to beat a tutorial] only to find literally nobody else googled this, I'm going to stop playing your game			",49,28,1,10,8,0,2

Finding the secrets made me feel like a genious. A very satifying little platformer puzzler with a very light story.It begins and ends with a space shooter but most of the game is a platformer.

												Controls are too weird, cant swap to wasd so i have to use arrows, i cant use the mouse, but even so, its too awkward to use only the keyboard. this is a controller game only, i dont even see why they enabled keyboard support.the game starts off ok, and there are weird ""puzzles"" but UGH THE CONTROLS FOR KEYBOARD, i was struggling on every puzzle because x and z are not my prefferd jump and shoot buttons, i prefer space to be sump and x for shoot, or mouse. there is an option to change controls, space is not able to be used, mouse buttons arent able to be used. i give this game a 2/5, there is work put into it, i can at least see that, but the controls are horrid, not only that, but the volume control is horrindus as well, i mark of 2 stars for that, and 1 star for no immediate backstory, from what i can tell, you're a spacecop and you gotta fight to protect your mother planet, there is no story as to why or anything so........

												The game is OK, but the lack of custom controls in unbearable. You use left and right arrow keys to move, and then Z & X to jump and shoot. For me it creates a akward flow of movement. You can change the jump and shoot key binds to a very limited number of keys, which still feel awkard. If the added more options, would be a good game.			",24,3,0,2,3,0,1

												I'd love to be able to recommend this game as it looks really fun but can't from my own personal experience. My experience is it's not possible to actually play it. I emailed the developers a couple months ago asking for help but haven't heard a thing from them.The problem is that the controls don't work using gamepad or keyboard & mouse. Once the start screen has loaded up, it's like there is a stuck key for pressing left and also up and down are reversed. So after eventually getting the game to load, your character immediately goes left and thats it ! the level is supposed to progress to the right so that screws that up, 2-3 seconds of seeing a sprite move to the left of a level isn't a good game in my books.I have googled the problem and searched forums but found nothing to help. So I'd avoid this game as it will be a gamble paying anything for it.			",173,26,14,5,18,1,15

												If you go into this game thinking that it will be a Metroidvania game based off its description you will be dissappointed. It is extremely linear and can be beaten in under an hour on your first playthrough with no prior knowledge of the game. I was only stuck on one of the puzzles for a long time. Art style is alright but nothing to be shocked by, basic chibi pixel. The soundtrack only had a few songs in it and some of them were pretty good. If I had to tell you my favorite part of the game I would say it is the bullet-hell shooters. Unfornately these are short segements at the begining and end of the game. For 2 bucks it is a resonable price, however I could get better games for 2 bucks on a smart phone.			",17,1,0,3,2,0,0

												Out There Somewhere claims to have been inspired by Cave Story and Super Metroid, but those games raise expectations in my mind that I feel the game did not meet. The game is far shorter than expected, my first playthrough lasting little more than an hour. It is also not nearly as varied as Cave Story and other Metroidvania-style games; you will spend the majority of the game with just your teleport gun and a normal gun. And while the puzzles involving the aforementioned teleport gun are definitely interesting, the claimed inspiritations led me to believe I would have a bigger arsenal at my disposal.Another issue I have with the game is the use of bullet hell-like portions of the game. These sections feel very out of place in a game that is otherwise essentially a 2D version of Portal.Out There Somewhere is a decent game, considering the price, but the tauted inspirations to me implied a set of standards that the game did not deliver. Like I said above, this is 2D Portal. If that is what you want, then this game will do. But if you're looking for something Metroidvania-esque, look elsewhere.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game lacks any form of tutorial about the teleport mechanic besides vague level names and brief dialogue leaving you to button mash to see what happens.  Very frustrating, especially when looking at guides and reviews that point out that the telejump mechanic works 75% when you do it right and I'm having difficulties trying to replicate what I did in the last room.  Thankfully for me I bought it for 19 cents so I don't feel so bad about ragequiting to go nurse my sore thumb.			",380,103,7,43,50,3,56

												If you want a way to blow a few bucks on a game that's less than 2 hours long this is pretty good. The game ends way too quickly and the concepts introduced are barely compounded upon in the late game. There is little story and just when it feels like the game is going to take off and start getting serious... it' over. It feels like an hour long tutorial to a more complicated game. The music isn't that great at all and it isn't really an ""artistic"" game either. It's a neat idea but there isn't any meat to this game at all. It feels like this game was thrown together real quick to make a quick buck.			",57,8,0,4,6,0,4

												Pros:-Metroidvania with matching art style-Interesting teleporting mechanics with different beams that do different things-Starts difficult, which makes it reminiscent of older games and their difficulty-60FPS?-Good soundtrackCons:-Pits of death. EVERYWHERE. And they're so open that it's hard not to fall in them during a puzzle.-Vertical Platforming that, if you fail one part, you will fall down a screen back to nearly the beginning every time.-Actually, all the puzzles make you restart them in one way or another when you fail one part.-Soundtrack doesn't really match up with the mood of some situations-NPCs are borderline useless to talk to, despite you being consistently encouraged to talk to them-WAY too many tutorials. Every time you see a new beam, the game wants you to know what it is. Every time a pixel on a graphic is shaded differently, the game has to bring up a slow-moving dialogue box to tell you. LET ME FIGURE IT OUT.-Puzzle mechanics are interesting, but they get bland very quickly, so to remedy that something new appears every screen or so in the beginning. This, however, will make the game even more bland in the end because there's way too much involved into the game that it's too complicated and ends up being uninteresting anyways.-Every once in a while I get lag spikes for some reason. I'm running on an Intel i7-4500U with 8GB RAM on Windows 10 (Home Edition) 64-bit. There is absolutely no reason this game should have any lag spikes. Also why does it claim it requires 512MB VRAM on the store page? Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst and Revolution require the same specs and is more graphically demanding in every way I can think of than this game. Also 1GB of RAM does seem like a lot to ask for with this sort of game Possibly unoptimized engine or code? I mean, I'm sure it can run on most machines decently, but if the developers here were working for a publisher for a larger-scale game, it would be unacceptable if they were to make the game require way more resources from the computer than it really should.Conclusion:Not really worth $1.99, you'd be better off paying around half of that for the game, or less.

												and i thought that kirby's nightmare in dream land was short, this is even shorter and easier. its soo easy in fact that its like a tutorial throughout the whole game, i thought i would do space travel as if in a hubworld to go to other places, getting a crew of space people and play with cool weapons, but there's only one world, one boss and you have only one life...i also don't understand the praise the soundtrack gets. actually it feels like a bbt level playlist that isn't rage inducing.its cleverly designed but damn its soo short. is this going to be a demo for something or this is it, just look at my playtime andyou can tell this is short, or maybe i missed something?please tell me.4/10just play an actual nes game, they're even longer than this.

												This review is based on the first few levels, but already I'm impressed by the music and the 2D portal mechanics, which utilizes your teleport gun.The story consists of Captain Yuri, a generic anime space cop chasing a generic fugitive alien warlord (named Grigori for whatever odd reason) onto the surface of the planet that they have botch crash landed on. Noticed the typo did you? Yeah there are a few in the game as well. I'm going to get to why I changed my review from a positive to a negative by the end of the game, but first we have to look at the positives:Pros:Silly fun and cool acheivementsOutstanding music, seriously it's never annoyingClever easter eggs and referencesFun ""2D Portal"" platforming, yes there are a lot of portal copycats, but this one is done wellSounds great, right? How could I not like this game after saying all these nice things about it? Well here we go:Cons:The plot is recycled barf, not that I expected much from this type of game, however this particular execution of ""You're the hero, he's the villian, go duke it out somewhere... IN SPACE"" was tired at best, which doesn't lend itself to the story like a Metroid game, or hell, even Portal's story was better. ""We're here to do research on portals, oh just kidding, I'm a sociopathic computer that has been trying to kill you this entire time!""This ultimately results in the one and only boss battle in the entire game. Did I mention this game was short? Yeah so with such a great game so far, guess what they went with for the boss battle, the one and only boss battle? How did JonTron put it again?Oh yes.Simon ♥♥♥♥ING says.Grigori goes from the left wall to the right every three times you hit him, and the only gun you have in the game you get in the second act (this game is not long enough to even have a third, mind you) and it's not a bazooka, it's a tiny little pea shooter that kills normal enemies in 4 hits, and Gregori needs half a bazillion to go down.Then Grigori decides it's time for round two in some spaceships that you've both miraculously had time to repair, and get this - during the game you were supposed to have picked up power ups you can only use in this one battle, but they are barely explained to you, and I don't think I picked up more than one. Oh what to do... Can't go back for them, so onwards you go for some more....SIMON ♥♥♥♥ING SAYS... BULLET HELL MODE.Yes, I ragequit that boss, yes, speedrunners have beaten this game in a clean 17 minutes...Maybe I'll go back and kill the dumb boss later...No, don't get it unless it's on sale, if for nothing else but the music, or just buy the soundtrack if it's available.Final verdict:3/10 - Cool (OK borrowed) concept and music with nice pixel visuals, but it all goes down the drain due to a tedious and unforgiving boss fight, and the lack of content or emotional investment/story development overall.

												While it is solid in what it does, and it is very much fun to solve how to progress some of the levels (or maps if you want so), The game lenght is so short, it's unreal. 4,99€ doesn't seem much at first, but I just beat it the first time I booted it up in 70 minutes. Sure I did not get all 11 thingys to upgrade the ships power, but that's also not necessary because the final boss is too easy. Get it while on sale, let's say about 1,50€			",157,50,2,25,6,1,4

												I literally beat this game in 54 minutes. When I beat the first boss (the only boss) the credits rolled and I thought the developers were making a joke. This is probably the shortest game I have ever played, and I was greatly disappointed by that. This game describes itself as taking the pages out of Super Metroid and Cave Story, both very long games with enormous worlds to explore, but this game is nothing like them at all. It's a shame, because what is in the game is awesome. Everything is built just right and it's something new I've never encountered before. But, this game is virtually a tech demo of what should have been a much more expansive game. If the developers made a sequel to this I'd buy it in a heartbeat, but this game by itself just isn't long enough to merit a purchase at its listed retail price.			",144,35,0,36,8,1,14

												This game is ok, but I have a few problems-1. The keys are so dumb. jump is z. Like what even. You can rebind them, but not to something sensible like up or space.2. The levels are repetetive. I'm already bored with the art style and level design3. The game brings nothing new. If you're looking for a retro platformer, look elsewhere. The classics are far better than this. Shovel knight did it right, but this has a lame story, dull characters, and nonexistanct plot.4. Did I mention that the levels are repetative?5. I beat the game in under an hour. I'm no speedrunner either. It's certainly not worth $5. You'd be better off playing some flash games.The soundtrack is pretty good though, but I mean, isn't that expected of modern retro games by now?tl;dr- Repetetive, frustrating, and terrible keybinding that you can't use up or space in. Brings nothing new to the genre.(I got this for 20 cents though so if its on sale get it then farm the cards :D			",146,12,2,11,22,3,21

												This will sound like a very strange criticism, but the game is too dark. My IPS monitor is calibrated for accurate colors and brightness and this is the only game where I can't make out what's what. Many tiles are dark violet and are almost indistuingishable from the black background.I could make the monitor brighter, but then I would have to calibrate it back again after I finish the game.Other than that it's a simple metroidvania where each room is a puzzle (or a series of puzzles). But without ruining my screen calibration it's unplayable for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												About 5minutes into the game, you end up in a dead room. The game fails to explain its own mechanics. Apparently the trick is to jump right before your shot hits the wall (so you end up teleporting and then going into the air). This is a hugely ""trial and error"" mechanic with very little point in mastering it. PROS: -? CONS:-Bad controls-Trial and error ""portal jump"" mechanic that is essential to finishing the game-Low budget-Crap graphics			",383,122,8,34,26,3,50

I don't think it is... I can't remember this game.Why am I reviewing this title? I don't even own it.

												Out There Somewhere is a waste of time.  Everything about it is uninteresting.  The puzzles are never challenging and the teleportation mechanic is berely explored.  Most enemies can be ignored and killing them is a chore because the gun fires too slowly.  Instead of being engaging, each obstacle only serves to inconvenience you.  The colors are so same-y, all the envoronments blend together, and so dark it's sometimes unclear where enemies and platforms are.  The music is generic and the writing is boring and entirely unneccessary.  Things were only put in the game because games usually have them, not because they add anything to the experience.  All they add are a few seconds to the game's paltry length.Everything in this game has been done better in a thousand internet flash games.  Instead of spending money on this, go online and play one for free.			",151,33,0,6,8,2,6

												This game is completely broken and does not seem to run correctly, if it ever does.  What's more, it actually breaks your Steam session as it crashes in such a way that Steam thinks that the application is still running.  This keeps you from launching other titles or uninstalling the game.There are WAY better games for a couple bucks that were actually developed correctly.  I'm honestly shocked this is still being sold in such a broken, steam-detrimental state.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Finished the game in just under 1h30m... It's way too short. I expected 4-5h of gameplay. Game mechanic is fun though. Way... Way too short. I'm Quite disapointed...I thought it was a space shooter + land exploration adventure game. There's only 2 small part with space shooting which are quite boring (no ship upgrades, etc...).This is more like a demo than a full game. I really have to wait for reviews on these indie games in the future. You never know what it's going to be like from the video presentation.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is ridiculously difficult, even with a gamepad.Update:It turns out all i had to do was git gud. Once i figured out how to double jump, the game was a breeze. I even did a second, much quicker run of the game where i was able to get nearly all cores and artifacts, upgrade the ship, and defeat the bad guy, in 40 minutes or less.So... the game is actually pretty decent after all: cute graphics and music, and fairly interesting puzzles and secrets.By the way, the secret to double jumping is that the character must touch the floor and jump right before the teleportation. So, just time the jump to land before the pellet hits the wall, keep your eyes on it, and jump right before it hits.			",196,89,2,26,18,5,45

												I was going through my games and I saw this one, which I had completely forgotten about. This game is really cool, idea wise and graphics wise and all that jazz.My playtime isn't particularly high because you know when you buy a lot of games on sale at once, and you give each of them a whirl and one or two stick out and you just kind of grind them while forgetting about the others? And then afterwards you kind of just never feel like playing the games you skipped out on again for no real reason? Even though you know they're fun and you'd enjoy it? Yeah, that is what happened here, sadly. Don't let the story make it sound like this game is boring or something, because it is really fun. I have no idea why I can't get back into it, but I think it's just that situation, since it seems to be pretty common (at least for me).Anyway, yes I recommend this game and yes it is pretty unique and a good puzzle experience.

												I don't remember getting this game, maybe I got it in a bundle, maybe during the Summer Sale.What I do know though, is that it's an excellent game. I've only played a while, but the mechanics seem consistent enough. Gameplay wise, I think there could be some improvements. I have an issue with using the jump and fire keys also being used to talk to NPCs. Besides that, though, this game is pretty great.One thing I have to highlight is the soundtrack. It's pretty dynamic, and really brings the atmosphere together, pairing nicely with the pixel graphics.			",109,23,2,7,5,0,9

But thats also the fun in it, trying until you succeed and getting that feeling of ''YES I DID IT''. I wouldnt really say that the game is hard, but it was atleast a challenge for me, a person who is new to platformers.

												This is definitely a fun little game. I would pay the 36 kroner they are asking for this game, if I had not bought this in a bundle on sale. It is extremely short, and the beginning and very end are extremely tedious, but the middle part is quite alright. It takes about an hour to finish if you are not a complete doofus (like I am) but I'd say that it's worth it due to the fun puzzles that sometimes make you feel accomplished, and because of the cute art style :3			",168,26,5,28,13,1,17

												A charming indie puzzle game here with a interesting mechanic of continued momentum while using a portal gun.  The overall difficulty of the game isn't very high though some of the later timing puzzles do get a bit of an exercise of rote memory.  I wasn't a speed runner through the game (taking just under an hour to clear the game) and I did not find any of the many many secrets in this game (finishing the game with no gun upgrades, no additional health and only 3 of the 12 cores for the final ship mission.Even still with the checkpoints being unfrustratingly placed the game is still possible to beat and I would recommend the title for anyone out there who likes games like this.  If I ""had"" to give some negatives to the game - it would be the general use of secrets hidden behind a screen (odd blind jumps) which makes it very easy to miss tons of things and the repetitive BGM.

												For some reason, this game feels like it shouldn't be as good as it is, but it is a great game. It's short and seems simple, but it has depth, especially if you want to complete all the achievements. It's a very good metroidvanian puzzle-platformer. Highly recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't remember getting this game, maybe I got it in a bundle, maybe during the Summer Sale.What I do know though, is that it's an excellent game. I've only played a while, but the mechanics seem consistent enough. Gameplay wise, I think there could be some improvements. I have an issue with using the jump and fire keys also being used to talk to NPCs. Besides that, though, this game is pretty great.One thing I have to highlight is the soundtrack. It's pretty dynamic, and really brings the atmosphere together, pairing nicely with the pixel graphics.			",109,23,2,7,5,0,9

												A really fun platformer with enjoyable music and nice enviroments. It's annoying when you fail at places over and over again. But thats also the fun in it, trying until you succeed and getting that feeling of ''YES I DID IT''. I wouldnt really say that the game is hard, but it was atleast a challenge for me, a person who is new to platformers.

												After enjoying completing the game with 100% and just some cards left to collect, I decided to give this fine piece of software a review.So what's this game anyway? Basically it's a platformer, with minor Shoot'em Up parts both at the beginning and the end of the game. Armed with a teleport gun and a space suit you control Captain Yuri on his journey to defeat the evil Grigori.Simple control scheme: arrow keys and 3 others, Z X C by default, Europeans might want to swap Z with Y prior to starting. The game does have controller support, I used a keyboard though and had no problems.Over the course of my several playthroughs and experiments I only encountered 1 or 2 minor bugs you wouldn't experience without specifically looking for it. Even if, none of them was game breaking. Otherwise it's got smooth and clean animations, perfect hitboxes and overall fair difficulty. There's no real tutorial but is streamlined on directs you perfectly through the mechanics, the growing complexity should be no problem for the average player.If you want all achievements though, you're in for a tougher challenge, brace yourself and activate your thinker.As for the design, it's an adorable small indie treasure, you won't get 10 hours of excitement but instead you'll get challenging fun packed into a small platformer. Nothing looks out of place, everything fits into this colourfully bright (but not bilindingly bright) small universe. Even the music is brilliant for such a small game, it's repetetive but it doesn't get boring, this way it's even fun waiting for the ""delay"" Achievement while doing something else. Only downside is there's no transition when the BGM changes but hey, it's not like that would hurt anyoneMy first playthrough took me an hour and roughly 15 minutes, the only thing that really got on my nerves was clicking through Yuris messages on my playthroughs after the first one...Bottom line: whatever you pay, it's a bargain			",654,157,21,100,18,3,52

												Having bought this in a pack of four games for next to nothing in the sale, I honestly feel like I'd have been happy to pay full price for this as the replay value is immense. The Story itself is actually quite short, and can be fully completed in under twenty minutes after enough practice, but what it lacks in length it makes up for in pure, unbridled fun. It plays like how you'd imagine arcade games would be nowadays, it's smooth, simple, and some of the moves you have to pull off require a serious amount of precision, not to mention patience! The teleport mechanic is nothing short of genius. It's one button that sends out one projectile that puts you wherever it hits; Poundland's answer to a portal gun. However despite the simplicity, it still has so much depth as you end up having to string together jumps and multiple shots to overcome obstacles in some very challenging ways, not many of which are immediately apparant towards the end or for a few of the secrets.That's another thing this game does well, collectibles. I went through my first playthrough taking roughly over an hour and I found a grand total of two collectibles. I didn't even know one type of collectible even existed until I saw an achievment for it! Without giving much away, there are some places that pure curiosity will take you on your second playthrough, using all your skills from the first, that will give you the best feeling of ""Woah, I didn't even know that was in the game!"" and then a feeling of ""What the F*** do I do to get that?"" and believe me you will try for anywhere between ten minutes to an entire afternoon to get that but you'll get it. And that feels so good. Behind all of this, is the brilliant and catchy soundtrack, which is stuck in my head forever at this point unfortunately!In short, well worth the price and I'm still coming back for more from a game which can be beaten comfortably in roughly half an hour. Well done Miniboss, you have me hooked!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've never left a review for a game but this an exception.  I picked this game up on a whim, and it didn't disappoint.  While the game is short, especially on subsequent playthroughs, I'd say it's about the length of the first portal game maybe a little shorter.  The gameplay is excellent except a couple spots where you don't realize where a platform is, and I thought the final boss, while fun, was just way too different from the rest of the game.  The music and art style is quite fun, with the few cutscenes having a distinct almost robotech flare to them.  This is a great and fun game, and I highly suggest checking it out, and I look forward to more from Miniboss.			",48,34,1,17,13,0,6

												19 cents for 90 minutes of gameplay? Totally worth it. However don't let the dev fool you with the ""inspired by Cave Story"" thing - sure the game looks kinda similar and I have no doubt this is what the dev intended, but there is almost no combat and when it happens it is incredibly slow paced. It's a puzzle platformer, not an action one.Also no movement acceleration that I loved in Cave Story and the newest Raymans, but it may be for the better as you'll need good precision from time to time.Music is nice, but I didn't find it memorable.Go for it, it's the best title you will find in the ""under 20c"" category.

												I have never written a game review before. That being said, this game is so good that I felt compelled to. This game is somehow so simple while simultaneously being intricate, engaging, innovative, and all while invoking a certain sense of nostalgia. The controls are seemless. The graphics are clear and nothing is visually confusing (which I feel should be enough for any game). The soundtrack is appropriate for the theme of the game. The only issue I had with this game is how short it is.It only took my about 90 minutes to beat the whole game, but I loved every second of it and wanted so much more. Buy this game now while it's on sale for a measly 19 cents, because it's well worth the full price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bought Out There Somewhere on sale for $0.19, it regularly sells for $4.99. It's worth the regular price, because I'd probably spend that much in quarters to beat it. I have 1.7 hours on record, and that was one playthrough to finish the game. The teleportation mechanic works well with the level designs. A few of the puzzles can be skipped easily with well placed portal shots, but they don't require enough effort to feel like more than small victories over what seems to be the planned route. A decent amount of that 1.7 hours was spent experimenting with routes through different areas, and found that the developers were a little bit amusingly playful, though I don't want to spoil the experiences for anybody who may be pleasantly annoyed by them.The game isn't really about fighting. It feels as though some schmup tutorial project was thrown into the project to add meat to the game, but its difficulty amounts to how quickly you can mash the fire button, especially with the large amount of life you're given during the schmup portions of the game. The Gauss gun is used in some decently challenging puzzles, but not really necessary for any combat.The music is reminiscent of Cave Story. I caught my head bobbing a few times, and had to look around to be sure nobody was up to catch my inadvertant dysrhythmic neck spasms.I described the movement on my twitch stream as being something between Super Mario Bros. 3 and Mega Man, with better air control than Mega Man, but maybe some more friction than SMB3. The controls feel tight and responsive, even though it requires about 1/4 to 1/2 of the game for me to develop a habit for good teleporter jumping.I finished this game wanting more. Definitely check this out if you enjoyed Cave Story, or any platformer that requires tight and precise movements using combinations of buttons.			",121,18,2,28,3,0,6

I finished the game in a little over an hour, which would be short for any other game, but Out There Somewhere manages to make the most of the time you spend with it, introducing gameplay mechanics generously, and subtley teaching the player new ways to approach old mechanics.I bought the game when it was on sale, however I regret that, as the game is well worth the 5 dollars it would normally cost.

												An excellent game, although the short game length might disappoint some people.The platforming and teleporting feels great, never had a frustrating moment with the controls. Also, the soundtrack for this is really good, everyone who likes retro tunes should check it out.There's also a lot of achievements for those interested in them. Even if you want to 100% the game you'll be done with it quickly but the achievements do motivate to play through it 2 or 3 times just to see if you can find all the collectibles or beat it in under 20 minutes (it can actually be beat quite a lot faster actually).I bought it for 19 cents on a ridiculous discount and had a real fun evening with it, I definitely recommend this. The short game length didn't really bother me, everything about it felt well designed and I'd rather have a short but fun experience than a long tedious one.			",140,27,0,16,6,0,13

												The gameplay mechanic is creative, and each completed puzzle gives a little burst of rewarding feedback.  Short game, not much longer than an hour for the first playthrough, if you take your time a bit.  Good replayability when trying to find hidden secrets in earlier areas with the skills you learn later in the game.Nice retro style, but really cool little animations thrown in for those who pay attention.  Super cute story.Music is great at first, though it plays solidly on repeat through some larger areas, and can get grating at times.  Personally, I got a second wind and started to jam out to it again after playing it long enough.Well worth the great sale price I got it for, though I still would have gotten an enjoyable $4.99 out of it had I paid original price.

												A very unique and enjoyable platformer centered around using a teleport gun, almost like a 2D Portal. The puzzles are well-crafted and clever, with more than one way through many of them. The biggest downside for me was the length of the game or, more accurately, the lack thereof. This game is very short. The 1.6 hours I have on record was a single full playthrough, beginning to end. The only replay value is in the achievements, if you're into that sort of thing. If you're like me, and couldn't care less about the achievements, you may find yourself thankful that you got the game on sale and only paid $0.19 for it. I recommend the game - not the price. $5 is a little steep for a game that's over so quickly. What's there is worth playing, but it's not worth the asking price. Even with as challenging as some of the puzzles are, requiring multiple attempts, I managed to beat the game in 90 minutes - and I'm pretty terrible at platformers.Get it on sale, and you won't be disappointed. Pay full price, and you might find yourself a little irritated at the shortness of the game.			",90,17,0,17,14,1,17

												There's a lot of junk on Steam, specially in the 2-49ct category. I bought this game for 19ct and I'm overwhelmed at how good it is. It's basially an 8-bit style platformer where Portal-style puzzles are solved with the help of a teleportation gun. The graphics are neat, the dialogs funny and the music is very retro, though it could use some polishing (the transitions between the loops are not very smooth and the music start to be very repetitive quite fast). Nevertheless, Out There Somewhere is a nice, challenging little game with NES-style graphics and music. Grab it if you see it in the bargain bin: it's totally worth it, or of course at full price, if you're a retro puzzle platformer geek. You sure won't regret it!			",308,53,1,19,14,0,13

Pretty short if you blitz through, with the majority of game time being in exploration for all of the different collectibles. Very charming graphics and soundtrack. Story isn't terribly strong, but the gameplay is great enough to make up for it. Difficulty felt just right - difficult but not too punishing and not discouraging.Overall, a very fun experience.

												Great style, great music, and very enjoyable and original gameplay. I enjoyed this game very much but sadly I was also done with it extremely quickly. That would be my only complaint as the rest of the game was simply fantastic. If this gets some additions later on, it would have the potential to become something really good. 8/10			",93,41,0,21,37,0,19

												A nice little platformer game that combines a Portal-like idea with 2D platforming genre. It took me 2 and a half hours to beat it, though there are achievements to beat it under an hour and to beat it under 20 minutes. That may sound short, and I have no idea how one is supposed to beat this game under 20 minutes, but for what this game is, it could have been bad if it lasted longer. Overall, this game is good and quite fun.Side note: There are two 2D space shooting segments, one at the beginning of the game and one as a second (last) phase of the final boss fight. Keep in mind that this game *is* a 2D platforming game, so don't get confused, angry, discouraged or something else like that when you find yourself in space. It's okay.			",412,114,14,78,28,3,61

												Out There Somewhere is a laid back puzzle platformer. The main mechanic is a teleportation gun which allows you to teleport where you shoot. The gun is similar to the one in The Swapper but time doesn't slow down when you fire it and you can't make multiple copies. The difference is that this teleportation gun preserves momentum. So if you fire it at a wall and jump right before the projectile hits you'll be jumping when you teleport.This leads to some interesting gameplay the first time through and some very interesting exploring on the second playthrough. The game clocks in at about 2-3 hours for the first playthough but it's almost better the second time through when you're better with the mechanics. It has a couple shmup sections but they are brief, which is bad if you're a shmup fan but good if you suck at them like I do.Overall I really enjoyed this game. If you like puzzle platformers with interesting mechanics I'd definitely recommend this to you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I purchased out there somewhere on sale for about 0.19 but wow this game is worth more, maybe not the full 5$ but if you find it on sale take it in a flash.So review, at first i was put off by the graphics and pricing and i tought ""This will just be a broken and/or clunky flash-game-like won't it?"", i was very wrong, this game has the same apeal of games like Cave Story whit a cute but functional ad sometimes gimm pixelart diesign choices and cleverness of puzles of the likes of Portal.This game has some issues tho, a lack of polish and 5$ for an hour game is enough to discourage anyone from buying this game.If the devs choose to expand the campaign with more story and  characters whith different mechanics it may be worth a full price purchase.

												Simple gameplay leading to a much deeper gaming experience than you may think.There are a few challenging mechanics to master if you're going to make it to the end, but they're not too tricky, and it's well worth it.There are also plenty of secrets that most players won't find on their first playthrough. Exploration is very strongly rewarded. There's also achievements for beating things extremely quickly, giving goals and motives for multiple playthroughs. This game was purchased for 19 cents. I easily got $5 worth of fun and entertainment out of it.			",44,9,0,4,2,0,6

I died at least a 100 times before getting into some civilized area. The puzzles are tricky and well-thought out.It will become a little repetitive after a while, that is untill the next puzzle shows up.Was well worth the €0,19 I put in it.7/10			",89,23,1,31,19,0,47

												I bought this game on sale for $0.49. I installed it, booted it up... and then continued to play until I had explored it all. While this game is indeed short [my first run through was about 1 hour and 50 minutes or so], it is extremely well-made. This game heavily reminds me of Cave Story, and my only regret is not buying it at full price to further support the developers. The main gameplay mechanic, a teleportation gun, is unique and implemented very well! Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys platformers, puzzle games, catchy chiptunes, or any combination of the three.			",71,8,0,3,4,0,4

												Good platformer, but it runs short. You can expect to do a sub 40 minutes playthrough of this game in your first try. It doesn't try to be overly complex, and you should also be able to get all achievements in under 4 hours. In terms of longetivity, it might not be worth the full price. Still, it's a fun platformer with good music, as these games should be.Definitely recommend it at a discounted price.			",191,31,3,55,9,0,16

I heard that it is really short if you know where to go, but if you haven't played it, then you don't know where to go. It took me about an hour just to get the jumps down. You have to teleport and then jump to get to certain ledges, it's easy to get stuck until you get the timing down. Well worth the price!			",191,41,5,18,12,3,35

												The reason I got this game was because the cards from it sold for more than the game itself cost when it was on sale... I expected absolute garbage from the game, yet found myself pleasantly surprised. There's actually a pretty good little game in here, worthy of attention even if it's not on sale oddly enough.The basic concept is you start out in a rather limited 2D space shooter. You get shot down, fall to the planet, and then have to collect parts to repair your ship and escape. The writing's mediocre at best, and the plot's hardly anything to write home about, but the gameplay really does shine surprisingly well.You have three buttons, other than left/right. These are jump, fire a gun when you find it eventually, and fire a teleporter gun. This sounds simple. It's not. They actually put pretty good effort into coming up with some creative puzzles that take a bit of thought to overcome with these few tools.Momentum's carried over, so if you fire a teleport shot, and it has enough time to travel, you can jump upward as it hits and keep going up from where you portal to. This is put to surprisingly good use with some really rather clever yet deceptively simple looking puzzles.Toss in a bit of exploration and some hidden goodies, advanced stuff and bonuses scattered around, and it's actually not a bad game at all.Yeah, the story sucks. Yeah, the dialgue is awful. Yeah, it's only about an hour long from start to finish. But you know what? It's CHEAP. And to be blunt, the gameplay itself is good enough to ignore all that and just sit down to a fun little puzzle game that vaguely has some ever so slight similarities to metroid.I can actually recommend this game at full price. It's actually worth it. Just don't expect it to have good writing is all. =P			",164,31,1,20,21,2,40

												This game was very fun for the few hours I have played.  Although the game is primarily built around platforming elements, it is more focused on puzzling the player to get stuck, instead of attacking the player with hoards of enemies.  Unfortunately, at least for me the puzzles were all pretty simplistic and easy to work through.  On the other hand, I do have much experience with similar puzzle platfroming games such as Braid and Portal.  Despite the little content and non-challenging puzzles, I highly recommend this game for its uniqueness and individuality for the cheap cost that it is.			",50,8,0,5,1,1,6

A sort of platformer-exploration game in the first run through and a mad dash in the second, and scouring the planet for the full set of fusion-coil-thingies... well, that part is harder.Fun and to the point. I'd recommend platformer-afficianados to get this one. I hope there's a follow-up!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TL;DR: $5 is $5.  You'll be entertained for an hour or two.The default button combo made me crazy, and some puzzles can only be solved if you know about things that you can't see.  They are hinted at, but I am not that smart.  In at least three places lack of a save point meant I had to redo a puzzle, but not in that deliberate, interesting, VVVVV kind of way.The space battle bookends were an interesting change of pace.  Not sure why it ends the way it does.The puzzles were all distinct from each other, which kept things fresh.  The reload time was painless.  This game might benefit from a ""speed run"" feature.  It might also benefit by keeping the camera centered on the player.  Firing the teleport gun in other directions might be interesting in the sequel.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bought this game for 24 cents on a sale out of boredom, didn't expect much. To my surprise i got a neat, little platformer with puzzles and a cool teleport system. It runs smoothly, has a nice soundtrack and the difficulty is pretty challenging at times (which is a good thing imo). It took me about 90 minutes to finish it but I missed almost all the upgrades, secrets and achievements. So there is enough to do for a second playthrough.I can recommend this game, especially for this low price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It took me 77 minutes to beat the game. But man was that possibly in the top of the best 77 minutes of video gaming I've ever video gamed. The pixelish graphics were nice to look at. The music was really good and added to the vibe. The gameplay was pretty innovative, easy to learn, and most of all fun. I had almost given up in those last 5 minutes because I died to the final boss around 15 times in near rapid succession. But that sense of triumph I felt upon beating the game just cannot be matched. 10/10/10Edit: The game says I beat it in under an hour so that's cool. Everything still applies and I will definitely be going back to attempt 100%			",131,18,0,16,8,1,14

												Very nice game, though short, finished it in about an hour but i only paid 20 cents or so (sale) so im not complaining^^ I actually felt kinda bad it was on sale when i found this, cos id like to pay the whole full dollar just to support devs like this (yeah, im that rich.)It plays really smooth, had no issues. Full of clever paltforming puzzles. Looks pretty nice, music is nice too, if you played alot of NES games you'll almost recognize the tunes. Works with DS4 out of the box (YAY). Im guessing it has atleast 2 different endings. The SHMUP stage you see in the trailer is just a bossfight basically, this is not a space shooter/platformer hybrid game, its 99% platforming.Well worth the money.			",33,12,0,8,0,0,6

												Hows this for a strange playthrough experience?I bought the game expecting nothing out of a cheap 2D platformer, but it had Trading Cards and Achievements so I thought why not? I started the game up and played through the first few screens until I got stuck at the first puzzle because I'm an idiot and I closed the game. I didn't touch it for a week and a half.Soon I was sitting in my chair hovering my mouse cursor over the 'Refund' button before deciding to launch the game a final time. If I couldn't figure out how to get past the puzzle in 10 minutes, I would get a refund and buy a trading card or something with the $0.49 I spent on the game. I ended up figuring out how to get through the level and I kept playing until the very end of the game. I then regretted not buying the game at full-price after I finished it, when just an hour ago I was about to refund it. It's not a very long game, but I think that's intentional. It's a game that deserves to be disected and studied. I've beaten the game six times in five hours, with one of my playthroughs being as short as 17 minutes and 42 seconds. I still keep going back and beating it again and again. This little indie game has me bewildered. It's addictively fun and perfectly difficult. It's the type of difficulty that doesn't take it easy on you but doesn't discourage you from retrying and you end up hooked. It's just short enough to not get boring too quick and just long enough to stay fresh throughout multiple playthroughs. The puzzles are ridiculously fun to solve while the 8bit score is blasting through your speakers. The game is packed full of secret areas and hidden collectibles that are easy to find if you know the game's tricks. Every single screen you come across has some sort of hidden entrance to a secret zone. The mechanics are inventive, fresh, and tight. The slow-moving projectiles of the portal gun give you time to think where you're going next and pull of some pretty incredible mid-air stunts if you're good enough. The control layout is of a standard arcade cabinent (I played with a controller however). Simplisity is key with this game, and that's not a bad thing.8.4/10 - tl;dr : The game will surprise you. It's packed with secrets and has a great soundtrack. The gameplay is addictively fun and inventive, with that Mario Brothers / Dark Souls type of difficulty that keeps you hooked. Short, but fun to replay over and over again if you're an achievement hunter.NOTE: I got a free Steam Key for another game called ""Polarity"" when I opened the game the first time. That right there in itself is worth 49 cents in my humble opinion. That, and the free soundtrack folder that comes with the games files.			",57,14,0,3,2,0,1

												Even though I got this game for 19 cents, I'd say it's worth a fair amount more than that.While it's very short, it's very clever. It's a puzzle platformer with a very unique and interesting teleportation mechanic that makes you think differently, which is welcome in today's video game industry.Though I usually dislike the indie-pixel-retro aesthetic, it works well here. The character designs are nice, the music is nice, the levels look good, and it controls very well with a gamepad.Like I said, it was very short, but the achievements encourage additional playthroughs and speedruns. If I'm left wishing there was more of a game when it's over, that usually means it was a good game.If you're only planing on playing through the game once, it might not be worth five dollars because it only took me an hour to get through, but if you're the kind of person that enjoys games like this and wants to to try something new, give this a shot. If you want to 100% the game and earn all of the achievements, I'm sure it'll take you much longer.			",254,82,2,24,18,2,16

												Out There Somewhere is a game that feels like an homage to action platformer games like Cave Story and Metroid. It is on the short side of gameplay (about an hour or two), but I had fun the entire time and wanted more when it was over. It also has plenty of hard-to-reach areas with secrets that require some prior planning and well-timed actions once you have a feel for it on your first playthrough. It is a great game that brings back memories of early platformers with some new, creative elements of its own.I'd highly recommend this game to anyone with a couple of hours to spare and a desire to play something that's just plain fun.

												Out of Somewhere is very nice platformer-logic game when you play as space ship comander that had to land on unknown planet and trying to repair her/his ship.There are a lots of levels,some secrets,8 bit graphic and music and a LOTS OF FUN.IF you have some spare time to use your brain and try something diffrent from FPS shooters give this game a chance and you wont regret this.Game is kinda small but still is great :).Also you can get steam trading cards and make profit!!8/10 very good for indie game that i would like to play more if there was more :C			",27,10,0,6,1,0,1

												19 cents for 90 minutes of gameplay? Totally worth it. However don't let the dev fool you with the ""inspired by Cave Story"" thing - sure the game looks kinda similar and I have no doubt this is what the dev intended, but there is almost no combat and when it happens it is incredibly slow paced. It's a puzzle platformer, not an action one.Also no movement acceleration that I loved in Cave Story and the newest Raymans, but it may be for the better as you'll need good precision from time to time.Music is nice, but I didn't find it memorable.Go for it, it's the best title you will find in the ""under 20c"" category.

												I played through the whole game thinking I explored every possible nook and cranny, only to find I had only gotten as far as 50/87 of the possible screens in the game :P This game is in a typical arcade style which is pretty fun. What I like is that if you're only in it to beat the game, you can do so in under 20 minutes (it's actually one of the achievements) and it won't affect your gameplay. However, if like me you feel like you need to complete the whole game and collect every possible object there is you can do that too, plus it gives you some more puzzles to solve. I bought this game on sale for €0.19 and after having played it I would have probably payed up to about €0.50 for it. Don't buy it for the full price, but it's well worth a go on sale :) Very entertaining			",66,8,0,9,2,0,2

												This is an awesome indie!  The gametime I have on this is the time it took me to beat it the first time around, had to watch someone else do a couple of these levels on you youtube to get further in the game, so it is challenging.  Out There Somewhere really gets you to think how to use your teleport ability to its full power.  It has a very retro/indie feel.  The soundtrack, controls and the overall look of the game are perfect.  I give it a 9/10.  Highly recommended!			",158,55,4,20,19,1,18

												I have never written a game review before. That being said, this game is so good that I felt compelled to. This game is somehow so simple while simultaneously being intricate, engaging, innovative, and all while invoking a certain sense of nostalgia. The controls are seemless. The graphics are clear and nothing is visually confusing (which I feel should be enough for any game). The soundtrack is appropriate for the theme of the game. The only issue I had with this game is how short it is.It only took my about 90 minutes to beat the whole game, but I loved every second of it and wanted so much more. Buy this game now while it's on sale for a measly 19 cents, because it's well worth the full price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Even though I got this game for 19 cents, I'd say it's worth a fair amount more than that.While it's very short, it's very clever. It's a puzzle platformer with a very unique and interesting teleportation mechanic that makes you think differently, which is welcome in today's video game industry.Though I usually dislike the indie-pixel-retro aesthetic, it works well here. The character designs are nice, the music is nice, the levels look good, and it controls very well with a gamepad.Like I said, it was very short, but the achievements encourage additional playthroughs and speedruns. If I'm left wishing there was more of a game when it's over, that usually means it was a good game.If you're only planing on playing through the game once, it might not be worth five dollars because it only took me an hour to get through, but if you're the kind of person that enjoys games like this and wants to to try something new, give this a shot. If you want to 100% the game and earn all of the achievements, I'm sure it'll take you much longer.			",254,82,2,24,18,2,16

												Bought Out There Somewhere on sale for $0.19, it regularly sells for $4.99. It's worth the regular price, because I'd probably spend that much in quarters to beat it. I have 1.7 hours on record, and that was one playthrough to finish the game. The teleportation mechanic works well with the level designs. A few of the puzzles can be skipped easily with well placed portal shots, but they don't require enough effort to feel like more than small victories over what seems to be the planned route. A decent amount of that 1.7 hours was spent experimenting with routes through different areas, and found that the developers were a little bit amusingly playful, though I don't want to spoil the experiences for anybody who may be pleasantly annoyed by them.The game isn't really about fighting. It feels as though some schmup tutorial project was thrown into the project to add meat to the game, but its difficulty amounts to how quickly you can mash the fire button, especially with the large amount of life you're given during the schmup portions of the game. The Gauss gun is used in some decently challenging puzzles, but not really necessary for any combat.The music is reminiscent of Cave Story. I caught my head bobbing a few times, and had to look around to be sure nobody was up to catch my inadvertant dysrhythmic neck spasms.I described the movement on my twitch stream as being something between Super Mario Bros. 3 and Mega Man, with better air control than Mega Man, but maybe some more friction than SMB3. The controls feel tight and responsive, even though it requires about 1/4 to 1/2 of the game for me to develop a habit for good teleporter jumping.I finished this game wanting more. Definitely check this out if you enjoyed Cave Story, or any platformer that requires tight and precise movements using combinations of buttons.			",121,18,2,28,3,0,6

												I really enjoyed this game. It was challenging enought to keep me trying and original enough to entertain me. Though the puzzles where not really hard I found the different amount of elements in them to be very fun to play with. CTChe only drawback: The length of the game. I finished it just shy of an hour. If you are a more casual player like myself I would advise to wait for a sale and buy it for cheap as the game is kind of expensive for the amount of hours you'll be able to play through.

												This game is a giant puzzle platformer that starts out as a 2D side-scroller space shoot-em-up. Not only that, but it is pretty challenging in some aspects. The music is actually freaking amazing and honestly, the gameplay just feels....right. As you make your way through the area you have to really use your head to get through the game. Like, REALLY use your head. Btw, to help those who possibly will get stuck near the beginning, the hidden tunnel in not far from the worm who tells you about it. Also, I got an achievement just by using my wit to get to a humanoid/anthropomorphic oak. This game is only 19 cents until Sept. 7th, so get it quick.			",20,5,2,0,1,0,0

												What a game, man.  I jokingly sold cards in front of a friend that didn't know you could do such to play it, just because why not?  Three hours later and I've enjoyed it more than most games, it held my attention because the achievements were something most games achievements aren't: fun.  I did all the ones I care about, no way am I going to get the ones that require me to suck, because those are dumb, but whatever.It's great, and if it's on sale like it is right now, 19c is little to ask for something that's actually somewhat inventive.  I mean, I guess it's all been done before, but the flow of the game is pretty unique with the techniques the portal gun employs in this.  Just check it out, if you like puzzling platformers, there's no reason not to.			",207,23,5,27,5,0,13

Despite the puzzles not being the most difficult in the world, the game is still fun to play a second and even third time after the first, as you will find something new every time.

												A charming indie puzzle game here with a interesting mechanic of continued momentum while using a portal gun.  The overall difficulty of the game isn't very high though some of the later timing puzzles do get a bit of an exercise of rote memory.  I wasn't a speed runner through the game (taking just under an hour to clear the game) and I did not find any of the many many secrets in this game (finishing the game with no gun upgrades, no additional health and only 3 of the 12 cores for the final ship mission.Even still with the checkpoints being unfrustratingly placed the game is still possible to beat and I would recommend the title for anyone out there who likes games like this.  If I ""had"" to give some negatives to the game - it would be the general use of secrets hidden behind a screen (odd blind jumps) which makes it very easy to miss tons of things and the repetitive BGM.

												I wanna move out there... somewhere...What I can say about this game - classic platformer with control points. Also - hard a bit. As usual,Well. Proc... maybe plot... I don't even know... I skip it almostly. Damn, is that all? What the @#=%?!Darn... Now about cons1- Music! The main irritating aspect of this game is music. Bit old-type melody I was awaiting, just like in Super meat boy game, shocked me. It was biting my ears, but the worst was that this melody sounds all damn time!!! Thank goddness I found option for muting this horrible noises.2 - Gameplay! This is piece of... big bad. Your hero moves slow, but your reaction must be quick!!! This is not SMB, where after hundreds of trys you will have automaticcally moutions  pressing all the buttons to reach final. In OTS every next try is like a reborn! ""This is may be good"" - can argue you! ""NO, DAMN!"" - answer I - ""After dozens of efforts I wanna see a result, my success, not every time single patters of hero dying/falling/restarting ect."" Also a lybirints build by crazy desighnirs of the game, but I can forgive them for their work done.3 - Video! I don't know. what they wanna do, but Mario seems more preety and smooth than this game. A lot's of colors with chaotic order of them placed makes my eyes bleed! Just see screenshots and remind my words.About my oppinion. I recomed this game. ""What the hell?!"" - you may ask me. ""I don't know"" - will be my answer.I just like this game. As much, as I hate it. We maybe have misunderstandig now, but... If you'll see this game on a sale - don't be greedy, buy it, and play, you'd like it, I swear.			",62,7,0,1,0,2,2

												I found this to be a very insteresting game. I didn't pay any attention to it at first, and got it as a part of bundle when it was on sale, and it took my brother to launch it and play a bit for me to realise that it's the exact game I'd like to play.tl;dr: I fell in love with it from the first actual sight :DGameplay here is like an old arcade, you have 5 buttons to satisfy all you needs, left/right+jump, teleport bullet and damaging bullet,It's easy to learn and pretty easy to go through, especially since game is pretty short (you can see that it can be finished under 20 minutes, took me ~15 on my first and last speed run). But if you want to uncover all the secrets that this game has you'll need to put your mind and reflexes into it. Most, if not all, secret places are spottable if you know where to look, but getting there might become the real problem there.I quite enjoyed the ride, even though it lasted only 4 hours for me to get all the achievements and find all the secrets. I still recommend it, especially if it's on sale.Overall: 10 secret gun upgrades out of 10			",211,110,4,58,15,2,14

												I bought this game not thinking very much of it at the time. When I got into the game my view for Out There Somewhere changed drastically. I found myself loving this game. Out There Somewhere mixes a bullet hell arcade shooter with a platformer. All of this is done with well crafted sprites and backgrounds and is accompanied by a stellar 8 bit soundtrack that never seems to get repetitive.Out There Somewhere excells with its platforming and space combat. However the platforming combat was quite dull and the characters movements were a bit sharp at times. Beyond that the teleportation gun added a fun addition to the 2D platforming style and allowed there to be puzzles in the game.The game is about an hour long but has replay value for those who want to complete everything. When I got stuck on certain areas I wasn't stuck for long as the puzzles are relatively easy. Overall I enjoyed this game and I recommend this game to all platforming fans, 8bit fans and indie fans. Out There Somewhere is a fun twist on the classic 8bit metroidvania platformer.Score: 7/10While having good graphics and a great soundtrack the platforming was a bit stiff and this game does not stand out from others of the same genre, but still a fun game nonetheless.

A breakdown of this game:- Soundtrack is really nice, fits the scene IMO- Pixel art done well- Gameplay mechanic is simple yet versatile.The only thing I think this game needs more is more talking aliens. Those guys are absolutely hilarious. Oh, and more really obscure secret areas. I like finding those.In the end, I enjoyed this, and you should too. Well worth the money.			",21,4,0,0,1,0,2

												If you're a fan of pixel art platform games there is no excuse not getting this game. It is pretty short but it's very appropriately priced and it has great replay value. The controls and mechanics are very fluid and the difficulty is well balanced; it's challenging but it never feels frustrating. The soundtrack is good and while the ending can feel a bit abrupt I never felt the story was the main focus of the game. Don't go into this expecting Undertale-level storytelling, but rather a really solid, mechanically challenging platformer.The only real downside I can think of is that the dialogue boxes could be smoother.

												I've only played it a little bit, but so far I'm loving it.Great ship shooting gameplay, great platformer aspects, amazing soundtrack, there's a million things I like about this game.One thing I didn't like is that you can sometimes miss checkpoints, which causes a lot of backtracking. Also, when you first unlock the weapon that actually hurts enemies, it does little to no damage (considering it's a one-hit KO on you), and one of the first enemies you face after getting the gun is one that flies around trying to get you. It makes it a lot harder when those ones are around.It's still a great game.8/10			",136,4,0,4,5,1,2

												Out There Somewhere is a puzzle game akin to Swapper, VVVVV, Portal, and any number of other games where there is a gimmick to move your playable character through puzzle environments.   Here you play as a tiny spaceman as he shoots rounds from his gun that instantly teleport him when the round hits a surface.  There are many different elements that flesh out gameplay like timed blocks, metal grates, beams that stop the round, beams that bend the round, beams that reflect the round, etc.   Your objective is nothing more than to reach the other side of the room so that you can journey on and collect space components to repair your spaceship. The graphics are pretty simple but are charming in their own right.  It's just some dark alien tileset and the enemies as well as the player are also a tile. Coming from how the game is played you don't need any more. The music is the only downside as nothing is catchy and may get on your nerves quick if you don't like 40 second BGMs from budget gameboy titles repeating over and over. All and all you can do no wrong getting this for under or near 1 USD.  Check this out, it's great fun and pretty addicting.			",223,42,3,10,8,2,11

												I bough the developer alliance bundle (on sale) and it is by far the best one in the pack.Its a puzzle platformer type, but the thing that makes it great is the use of the teleport gun. Unlike any other 2D platformer I have seen.The only downside is I am currently at the what appears to be the final boss battle, as I have always hated boss battles. I much preferred the challenging puzzle/levels throughout the game that might take me a few minutes to solve, but I get it eventually. This boss battle is just avoiding attacks, which is both hard and boring.Overall, great game. Totally worth the price tag.			",20,5,0,2,6,0,5

												Just played through this last night, and I'd have to say it was quite fun and worth the money I spent on it.My one gripe with the game is that you'd never be able to 100% it on your first blind playthrough - there's things you need to prepare to get before hand or you only have one chance to get.To counter that, though, most subsequent playthroughs will be about 30 minutes, so it's not like its a huge loss.

												Out There Somewhere is short, but very well designed. The core teleportation mechanic is put to good use and jumping is tight, making the puzzle platforming very satisfying. There's also decent replay value with the hidden cores and health boosts you can collect. I'd suggest you go for all of the achievements so that you can see everything the game has to offer (7-8 hours of gameplay).Not much else to say here. Out There Somewhere is pretty much always on sale, so make sure you buy it then.			",72,10,0,7,4,0,2

												Out there somewhere is one of the hidden gems I have found while searching through Steam’s sales, and personally, I enjoyed playing through it.	At first, OTS looks like one of the dime-a-thousand pixel-art 2-d platformers that make up quite a few of the indie games for sale on steam. When investigated further, it is revealed that the game is a bit above the rest.	The main story of the game, is very simple, and is only there because it has to be in order for the game to make sense.	Captain Yuri and crew fight off the evil alien, Grigori, and Yuri goes in alone to stop him, gets shot down, and lands on an alien planet. From there he must repair his ship, and find Grigori to defeat him.	Bland and stereotypical as the story may be, the music is anything but, and ranges from chiptunes to electronic to orchestral. From the moment you launch the game, you are greeted by a dark track that gets you in the mood to play. While it may not be as memorable as Level one of Mario, or the Legend of Zelda theme, the music is still catchy, and because the soundtrack is $0.99 DLC, I listen to it in my spare time, in fact while writing this review I have actually been listening to the music to get in the spirit.	The actual meat of this game centers around teleportation and momentum to solve puzzles. There are two side-scrolling shooter portions, but I’ll get to those later. You are given two guns at the start of the game, the teleportation gun, and the regular gun, with one heart, and one direction to go, right.  The main focus is of course the teleportation gun, which has momentum mechanics, basically, if you jump right before your shot hits a wall, you jump when you teleport there. There are also three beams and various blocks/mirrors that affect how your shot will land. Overall, the puzzle section is definitely solid. There are various power-ups, ship upgrades, and heart/health containers that you can find in capsules by exploring, but they are not necessary to beat the game.	The first time I played through, it took me 2 ½ hours, without picking up any capsules. The game contains plenty for a short amount of time though; there are two ship battles with Grigori, where the parts you collected come into play, and one boss fight that uses the mechanics you’ve learned throughout the game, to go along with the puzzles and side-scrolling.	For the price I bought it, I believe that the game is very good, with a few flaws here and there, and deserves a solid:8/10			",57,11,0,8,3,0,2

												Out there somewhere was a great game, it was a fun and challengeing experience. And it felt great when you got those ""Aha!"" moments. I especially liked the fact that it was a sort of blend of Megaman and Portal with a hint of Lifeforce or Jamestown at the begining and end. However I was expecting more out of the boss fight at the end. With the overall difficulty of the game up to that point I thought it would be much harder than it was. In fact it was probably the easiest part of the game. Overall this game is great, great retro style graphics, great mechanics, great gameplay, great music, meh final boss. 9/10			",75,14,0,12,10,0,5

												This game is everything I have ever wanted in a short, cheap Metroidvania puzzle platformer. Don't buy it for $5, but for $0.19 it's a steal. A very cool and not at all gimmicky teleport gun mechanic, controller support, and a campaign that takes 90-120 min if you don't know what you're doing, 60-90 min to 100% if you know what you're doing, and 15-25 min to speedrun if you know what you're doing. I've played through the game start to finish about 5-7 times and I still don't have all the achievements. The collectibles are extremely fun and there's only one that I had to look up where to find it (the 11th core). All in all, I recommend this game to any fan of Metroidvania games and puzzle platformers. My only complaint is that backtracking is severely limited, but it's OK because the game is so short. Great replayability, great value, great game. 9/10.			",189,59,1,20,15,4,21

												*NOTE: This review was written by an individual who purchased the item at the time when it was  obscenely discounted (96%)!*Portal + Metroid (NES) = Out There Somewhere.  This was a great little game, and I would have loved to have seen it last longer.  It took me about 2 hours to beat the game, but there is a marginal amount of replayability if you push for acquiring all of the Steam achievements.The game is 2D Metroid (NES) style and is very linear, with a few optional detours for special items if you feel up to it.  Each side-scrolling screen you pass into plays out as increasingly difficult Portal-type, platforming puzzles.  Near the 2/3 mark of the game, there were perhaps 2 screens that were difficult enough that I had to cave in and check a walkthrough for and when I found the answer, it was a slap-upside-the-head DERP answer I felt like I should have obviously known, but some spots do require some brain-power, which were refreshing.*DISCLAIMER: Everyone and their dead dog needs to buy this game while it is only 19 cents to purchase!  That being said, although it is a ton of fun, I personally would not recommend it for the full $4.99 price tag due to the overall lack of bang for your buck.*			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'll be honest here, I just bought it because I saw the discount (0,19€ at the ime of this review), but I have to admit, it's a pretty fun experience. It can be a bit frustrating getting used to the silly controls (default X & Z for jumping and firing portal gun and you can't set jump to spacebar or arrow up key - in fact, you cannot change movement controls at all), but once you get the hang of it, it's quite satisfying when you land a double reverse jump whateverdoodle trick.The art style is very likeable and the soundtrack is nice and chill, all in all making for a fun little game.10/10 would rage at control options again.

												Just another puzzle platformer, if a well-executed one. This is only a metroidvania if you consider finding a single upgrade and collecting hidden things that have no immediate benefit (and no meaningful benefit in the long run either) to be enough to call it one of those (and I don't).Basically, this is a game that belongs on Kongregate or Armor Games but decided to ask people to pay money for it on Steam instead of tolerating ads to play it at one of those places. I got the achievement for beating the game in under an hour without actually trying to do so, which should tell you just how little content it has.All the same, it's fun for what it is. If it looks like you'll like it and its current price looks super cheap to you, go on and get it.			",155,29,0,29,6,0,11

												Out There Somewhere is an action-platformer where the primary gimmick is a gun that teleports you to where you shoot it. It's quite short — my first playthrough clocked in at just over an hour — but even so there's a surprising amount of depth in the game's platforming challenges, as well as a few secrets here and there to discover. I legitimately tried looking for as many as I could in that first playthrough, only to discover at the end that I had missed around half of them. Additionally, for the speedrun inclined, there is an option to display a timer, and it is entirely possible to finish the game in about 11 minutes.The game doesn't feature a complicated plot — it's the simple tale of a space cop who has to shoot up an evil alien dude. If you're a huge nostalgic memelord you might enjoy the blatant Zero Wing references. Graphically, the game resembles Cave Story with extra frames of fluidity added to the sprite animations. It's nice to look at in general, and the alien friends are charming. The chiptune music is also pretty good, save for one annoying track near the beginning of the game that seemed to only last like 20 seconds before looping.There are several minor issues I suppose I should mention. For one, there are many screens that cannot be returned to once they're left, and frequent checkpoints, while normally a boon, mean that if you've missed a collectible, you've probably also lost the opportunity to get it. Considering that health upgrades are part of these collectibles and you only have one health to begin with, it is entirely possible to end up past a point of no return where you have to finish the game as a one-hit-wonder, or just restart because it's too annoying to handle.Along with that, there's also an achievement that requires having 30 teleport gun shots on screen at once; the only apparent way to do that causes a cacophony of ear-piercing sound effects unless the game is muted. I can't imagine this being an oversight, and since I'm a jerk I found it sort of amusing, but still ow.Nitpicking aside, Out There Somewhere is a solid title for anyone in want of bite-sized platforming fun. It is also literally $0.19 during the Steam Summer Sale, and the 3 Steam Trading Cards it drops should recoup the bulk of that price. This game is a must buy before the sale ends.p.s. i just noticed that the developer's logo mascot changes colors on every start up and that is an odd feature i don't know if anyone but me would notice but i like it thank you			",237,115,3,40,22,1,33

												Charming gameplay, graphics and mechanics. My first full playthrough took 40 min, but there's some good replay value here. The soundtrack is solid (more importantly, it's cheap XD ). The teleport-gun is satisfying to use and the mechanics are implimented well. I feel like this game is a must-have if on-sale for < $1.50.			",83,17,0,0,1,0,5

												A cleaver little game with a humorous retro style and a single gameplay gimmick, the teleport gun. This makes it a bit of a one trick pony, but the developers explored their sole innovative mechanic quite thouroghly and rolled credits before they ran out of ideas. There is certainly more that could be done with it, especially in combination with other 2D traversial mechanics, but I commend the team for keeping is package small and focused.With tight controls and ample feedback from animation and sound effects, the game feels great to play, like the best of the 8-bit era the art mimics.

												This game was inspired by the likes of Cave Story, and it holds the same charm. While not as long, and more platformer-based then Cave Story, it manages to keep you entertained for 1-2 hours, depending on how much time you spend finding secrets. The lack of true bosses actually surprised me, but it in no way hurt the game.			",52,3,0,3,0,0,2

												Short and sweet! Played through it twice in just over two hours.The main mechanic is a portal gun. You're teleported to the bullet's location when it hits something. It requires some timing, especially when you need to jump just before being teleported, but it isn't brutal.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fun little game with a great soundtrack and game mechanics.  It's challenging enough to keep you thinking but not rage inducing like some other games.  It wouldn't hurt to have a bit more variety in enemies/scenery, but it doesn't detract much.  For the cost, it's a good 1hr-ish playthrough that might have you coming back for a second time if you want to improve your time and explore for more secrets.			",953,222,33,95,80,9,117

												Short and sweet puzzle-platformer - the mechanics are built around one superb idea, and - quite a relief after several bad experiences - the controls are snappy and responsive.The aim of the game is to navigate through various screens to get an important part of your spaceship. Beside walking and jumping, you have a teleport gun - it fires a blue projectile horizontally, and where it hits, there you'll be teleported. Teleportation maintains the momentum you have at the moment when the projectile hits - that opens up a boarload of navigation puzzle opportunities, which are thoroughly explored by the game designers.The game has a cute 8-bit-ish soundtrack that you'll either love or hate - I happen to love it.Out There Somewhere is an ideal casual game - short (1-2 hours), not too difficult but not trivial, and thoroughly enjoyable. Worth maybe a couple of EUR / USD - at the 0.20 I got it, it's a steal.			",293,168,25,29,36,5,62

												While the game is short and unpolished, the puzzles feel rewarding. I had multiple moments where the game made me feel like a genius. I never had to look up a guide for a puzzle and the most I spent on a single room was about 10 minutes. I wouldn't say the game is hard. But It's definiely not something you can walk right through. Getting all the acheivments is very difficult. It requires you to play through multiple times using your knowledge from the previous run.			",47,5,0,10,2,0,2

												Well, if you don't deviate from the main path the game is actually fairly short. Around an hour depending on how good you are at puzzle platformers. If you explore everything, though, there is A LOT more to this game. There's so much hidden stuff, it's crazy. The soundtrack only makes it better. This might just be one of my favorite soundtracks ever. The flaws it does suffer from is that controller support is a little bit finicky, but it doesn't affect anything aside from little inputs ever so often. That might just be on my end though, so take that criticism with a grain of salt.Overall Score: BUY THIS GAME. (aka 9/10 by my standards.)			",99,21,0,8,9,1,2

												I don't agree that this game is anything like Super Metroid or Cave Story. Don't expect to upgrade your teleporter or gun, gain extra abilties like double jumping or branch into different areas as I have not encountered anything like that half an hour into the game but do not be surpirsed if it does show up. If anything, I would describe it as Super Meat Boy (Lite!) with Portal, although with a different physics mechinic in place of flinging.It's not kidding when it describes its other elements, though. It really is a refliex-heavy game. Often, the player may solve the puzzle long before he or she actually completes it because of the timing and aim required for the exeuction. It's honestly pretty satisifying, as a result, to get through a room because I managed to not only figure out the crazy, over-elobrate plan where I need to let some beam idle for 4.5 seconds before activating the second beam, destorying a boulder on the far right, teleporting to a platform on the left using the first teleporter, waiting for the first beam to deactivate (as beams block each other), and then using the second beam to get to the door.  This, however, can be frustrating if a player wishes to rush through the game or something. That is all the game has going for it.The chiptune music doesn't really motivate players to take their time, being ridicalously reptitive and loud, and the setting and story isn't memorable or worth paying attention to so far in my playthrough. I do not even know the name of my pro- oh, it's Yuri. My male protagonist's name is a common tag for lesbian storylines in manga. Hooray. The artstyle is, well, more of what you see can see in the store page.It's fun but nothing more than an extended flash game to me. It doesn't have the humor of Portal and so the only really motivating to keep playing is to complete more puzzles. Get it when it goes on sale for less than 50 cents. ",158,18,4,16,17,2,15

												First off, I bought this game on a whim for when it was only 19 cents, because I had some spare money from the steam sale, and this looked like something that wasn't a ripoff of Minecraft, see 7 cent 'Uncrowded'.I played it through to completion, and though while the puzzles are phenomenal, using a set of mechanics that really support the platforming, and give a whole new spin on it by the end, there are somethings I dislike about this game, and will mention below.First off, all the tacked on mechanics, i.e. the space battles, which are the first and last things that happen in the game.  They're contrived, really have no point, and if the game ended with the final battle that tested your skills, then that would be amazing, not the 'This is my final form' bs.And second off, the story will rub you the wrong way.  It will.  I recommend skipping all the dialogue, because its a McGuffin plot that thinks it's more than that.  (See risk of rain plot development, or lack thereof)Buy this game on sale, if nothing else.  Its short 2-3 hour campaign is just long enough to excite, and leaves you eager for more.

												Oh... My... GodYey Yes Yes all the yaaaassGot this game for 19 cents, and it was more than worth it.So, I'm gonna tell you guys why I loved it so much.Visuals- One word: Pretty. Done in an 8-bit fassion, and done well tooGameplay- Also done well. It gave me a portalgasm, and that's always goodDifficulty- My main man, fair challenge. Enemies are better avoided than fought, and the platforming is very dynamic and will take any gamer several tries at some point. And in the whole game, I didn't die once where I didn't think it was my own fault.Price- At 19 cents, totes worth it. At 2 bucks however, not so much. It was short, but amazing, I played it in one sitting, but I think 1$-$1.50 is a fair price.Overall: 8/8 Best indie game I've played in awhile.			",75,10,0,7,6,1,6

												Very short cute game. You can finish it in two hours. Graphics is not bad, but not incredible. Mechanics with jumping and teleporting make the game enjoyable. Story very shalow. Villain attacks your side, you have to go after him all alone. We don't know who your side is. Could be evil intergalactic empire populated by good ordinary people doing their jobs and the villain a freedom fighter who dares to defy the ruling empire. Of course he is used to being on the other side of the law so he looks like a pirate and its given him a bad rep. While you the hero are  a overzealous enforser of the said empire and you don't see how in the long run the empire is trampling on the lowest developed worlds while the prosperous worlds keep getting prosperous. Like I said shalow story, lost potential. Get the game at a discount and it doesn't matter its short. TL;DR Fun platformer game. Very short. Find it on a discount and buy it.			",81,50,0,25,12,1,11

												I can't really recommend this game at regular price (2 bucks) but at it's current sale price (50 cents) I guess you can go and nab it. The game's mechanics are sound, the music is nice, and the overall presentation is pretty good, but the major, major flaw of this game is it's length. The whole game from start to finish is a mere hour in length, though if you're a huge completionist you can get some more playtime out of it. When I got to the end of the game, I expected it to continue onward, exploring another world or something, but instead it ends at a cliffhanger and left me wanting more out of it. That would be fine if this was like a demo, but for a full game? Not acceptable.			",42,5,0,3,12,0,3

												This game is easy for the casual, difficult for the achievement hunter.The game is pretty linear for casuals, but it branches out when you explore even a little.Unlike many of the easy-hard games, 'Out There Somewhere' is all puzzle, and while people who just get right to the end have an easier road, those people have a somewhat harder to beat ending than those who have explored.Don't know what I'm talking about?Just play this game already.

												             One late night, 'Cave Story' wandred into the house, drunk as usual. 'Portal 2' looked up from her magazine, to see the love of her life stumble in through the front door. 'You Have to Win the Game' and 'Risk of Rain' were already asleep, 'Cave Story' arived home too late to say goodnight to either of them. 'Portal 2' looked up at the love of her life and said, ""Were have you been?"" 'Cave Story' looked up, as if surprised to be asked a question as such. ""I was... just out with some Mimigma eating some cake an' stuff... you know the usual."" 'Cave Story' replied. It was the worst lie about cake that 'Portal 2' had ever heard, and even 'Cave Story' knew it. ""Look, I'm sorry, its just that ever sense my fanbase went down, I've never really been the same. We both know how it is..."" 'Cave Story' said, without the courage to look 'Portal 2' in the face. ""Its alright."" 'Portal 2' responded. at this, 'Cave Story' looked up at his wife, as if surprised that she would be so kind to him after what he had done. ""I guess we've both had some screw-ups, but we always manage to pull back out of it."" 'Cave Story' couldnt believe what he was hearing, afterall, 'Portal 2' was still beautiful to him. Her amazing gameplay, memorable charecters, interesting and intreging puzzles. 'Cave Story' knew he had to make this right. ""Look 'Portal 2', I know I've had some screw-ups before, but, what if I make it right for you, tonight."" 'Portal 2' blushed at this remark. Even after all this time, she still loved him as if it were the first day they met. 'Cave Story's' amazing gameplay and control, the soundtrack, and the story were enough to make her fall in love with him all over again. ""Alright."" 'Portal 2' said, ""You can make it up to me tonight then. 'Cave Story' smiled and turned off the lights, both of them headed upstairs, and proceded with the game.Nine months later, 'Out There Somewhere' was born.THE END			",73,14,0,9,3,0,0

												This game is worth a lot more than it's price. Don't be fooled by the 199 cent price tag this game is good. Maybe even great. First off the soundtrack, is great, it's refreshing, catchy, and motavating in whatever area you are.While the story is simple, this doesn't really make it worse, as the game is mostly reliant on it's puzzles for quality, and that's a good thing too, because the puzzle are pretty good also. They're all sentered around this portal gun that beams you to wherever the bullets hit. From there, new elements are added to modify gameplay slightly, but overall, the basics are the same. As far as difficulty, this game is a medium, although there will be certain rooms that are so strangely difficult and out of nowhere that you'll be tearing you hair out either trying to find the solution or trying to figure out how to put that solution into action, but most of the time it's a pretty smooth, slightly difficult challange.Overall, I deffinetly recommend this game to anyone who likes platformers.8/10.

												Pretty good. Teleporting is not really my game. Bought it anyway on sale (for point something money) played for a couple of minutes before quitting, like I knew I would. Let it sit on the shelf for some months. Then played again, continued and finished. Not too difficult. Rather short. Which is okay for point something money.I've played a bunch of similar games before, and I especially love the ones where you upgrade yourself. Like you get double jump, get jetpack, learn to breathe underwater, get more life and so forth. In this game you get a gun at some point and that's it. I was a bit disappointed. But for one money I'd get it. Will never play it again though.			",21,15,1,3,5,0,4

The teleportation mechanic is lots of fun especially once you realize you can shoot multiple teleport shots at once to really make moving around interesting.  I really hope they make a second game or at least another game with a similar mechanic as I could have keep playing this.			",92,15,1,11,23,0,37

												A very fun and short space puzzle game, with a unique spaceship shooter trait thrown into the mix. I thought it was great till i had to fight the final boss dickweed. took me forever to get that ♥♥♥♥hole.  For how short the game is however, and the lack of replayablity, (aside from its achivements) it is worth 2 bucks if you can play the samething for long periods of time. SO get it on sale. its still really fun.			",137,17,4,7,5,0,6

												After enjoying completing the game with 100% and just some cards left to collect, I decided to give this fine piece of software a review.So what's this game anyway? Basically it's a platformer, with minor Shoot'em Up parts both at the beginning and the end of the game. Armed with a teleport gun and a space suit you control Captain Yuri on his journey to defeat the evil Grigori.Simple control scheme: arrow keys and 3 others, Z X C by default, Europeans might want to swap Z with Y prior to starting. The game does have controller support, I used a keyboard though and had no problems.Over the course of my several playthroughs and experiments I only encountered 1 or 2 minor bugs you wouldn't experience without specifically looking for it. Even if, none of them was game breaking. Otherwise it's got smooth and clean animations, perfect hitboxes and overall fair difficulty. There's no real tutorial but is streamlined on directs you perfectly through the mechanics, the growing complexity should be no problem for the average player.If you want all achievements though, you're in for a tougher challenge, brace yourself and activate your thinker.As for the design, it's an adorable small indie treasure, you won't get 10 hours of excitement but instead you'll get challenging fun packed into a small platformer. Nothing looks out of place, everything fits into this colourfully bright (but not bilindingly bright) small universe. Even the music is brilliant for such a small game, it's repetetive but it doesn't get boring, this way it's even fun waiting for the ""delay"" Achievement while doing something else. Only downside is there's no transition when the BGM changes but hey, it's not like that would hurt anyoneMy first playthrough took me an hour and roughly 15 minutes, the only thing that really got on my nerves was clicking through Yuris messages on my playthroughs after the first one...Bottom line: whatever you pay, it's a bargain			",654,157,21,100,18,3,52

												I've never left a review for a game but this an exception.  I picked this game up on a whim, and it didn't disappoint.  While the game is short, especially on subsequent playthroughs, I'd say it's about the length of the first portal game maybe a little shorter.  The gameplay is excellent except a couple spots where you don't realize where a platform is, and I thought the final boss, while fun, was just way too different from the rest of the game.  The music and art style is quite fun, with the few cutscenes having a distinct almost robotech flare to them.  This is a great and fun game, and I highly suggest checking it out, and I look forward to more from Miniboss.			",48,34,1,17,13,0,6

												K, I finished it. Its a great little game. Because Im a cheapskate, I like games to pay only for games that are replayable but I got it at a major sale of 96% off, (19 cents). Because the game is only 1.5 to 2 hours long, I would not reccomend it for full price of 5.00$. As a game itself though, it was great! Its a mixture of the old style look of games like metroid and a little of a Portal like idea.  A great strategy game, kept me on the edge of my seat. Not extremely frustrating, but at times not easy at all. I Loved It! I would only reccomend it though at a most pricepoint of 3.00$ in my opinion, but if your bored and you got an extra five bucks, dive in! I love how it switches from strategy to (for a very short time) a galactica type of game. I actually wish they would expand it so that say you would need to go onto different planets, gather parts and then launch back up where you would again engage mid space. AMAZING SOUNTRACK, SO CATCHY!!! I LOVE IT!!! WHERE CAN I BUY IT?! Great Little Game! (-1 due to full price evaluation) 9/10			",34,2,0,1,3,0,4

It's challeging and fun, the sound is phenomenal, and also it's\ | | | | | | | | | | | | | | /- REPLAYABLE!! -/ | | | | | | | | | | | | | | \so you can keep experiencing the joy of teleporting into lava and dying or falling off a level again and again and againalso, Grigori will kick your♥♥♥♥♥if you don't spend time looking for collectiblesalso, you will end up trying for achievementsso GOOD LUCK HAVE FUNreally there's no good reason NOT to get this game, especially when it goes on sale.P.S Literally made my money back in steam trading cards, so good financial investment too :D			",54,6,0,6,10,1,13

												This is a mix between Portal and Super Metroid.  The controls are tight and the gameplay is original.  Using the portal gun in this game really makes you rethink standard platforming conventions, and when you get the hang of the controls the game is a lot of fun.  I got this game on sale for 19 cents and it was certainly worth more than that.  However, I beat the campaign with many secrets in under an hour, so I'm not sure it is worth the full 5 dollar asking price.  Replayability is in trying to unlock all the secrets, although even unlocking them all during a second playthrough only adds another 30-60 min of gameplay.  In all, this is a really interesting game and I'd certainly recommend it during a sale.			",161,20,1,18,2,1,28

												THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!Not a hardcore platformer, more like a puzzle portal-inspired platformer, i love the game it's amazing, the puzzles are well made, easy to solve but tricky to execute, the story is simple but the whole map and the platforming are just outstanding, This reminds me of VVVVVV because all screens have a name, reminds me of portal because of the teleport gun that conservates momentum and cave story for the ligh-hearted story with hardcore challenges that are just there (like speedrun the game in 20min D:It's a gem, i hope it's not a hidden one because it's just amazing, only down side could be that it's short, but i think it doesn't overstays it's welcome, it's a really good game and i didn't feel ripped off for a 1.5h experience because it was a really fun 1.5h unlike other games were you spend that time farming, this has none of that.EDIT: second playthrough, got more achievements, this is awesome!<3			",329,87,6,40,22,5,32

												It was pretty short (will probably take you about 45 min to 1 1/2 hours) which is why I would recommend putting it on your wishlist and waiting for it to go on sale (I got it for like $0.19).  Besides the overall length of the game the gameplay was actually way fun and the puzzles were very well thought out and difficult due to time and effort put into them, rather than just being annoyingly hard like many games.  Great game, and if it had maybe 1 or 2 more hours of playtime I would say it was worth that full $5.00 price.  Honestly for $0.19 I was super surprised and loved it because honestly I was expecting a giant pile of horse♥♥♥♥♥♥for that price!			",57,8,0,11,2,1,0

My experience consisted of a playthrough to beat the game, a playthrough to get all of the non-speed-based achievements, and then a playthrough to beat the game in less than 20 minutes for the last achievement.  The gameplay did not get old during my time playing and by my third playthrough I enjoyed using the mastery of the mechanics to blaze through the game for that last achievement.  Overall, I recommend Out There Somewhere for a fun indie experience.			",432,188,8,66,34,6,80

												TL;DR Mario banged chell from portal and their kid turned anime and♥♥♥♥♥♥ Now baby mario is going on his own adventure to find Samus.What would happen if Mario (aka jumpman) finally made it to the castle, and didnt find peach. Instead, he fell down a long tunnel, and woke up in Aperture™ Sciences and found the portal gun. Then he got stuck in a time space portal and woke up in an anime space cadet simulator. This brave new frontier is what we now so lovingly call ""Out There Somewhere""; a direct refrence to the plot of this game. I have yet to find it, and the replay value is practically nil. But its a nice game for the monies, and I would rather buy a whole new game, than a CS:GO case key anyways.			",41,2,0,1,1,0,1

All in all was fairly fun (fun enough for me to play through twice) but it lacks content and difficult puzzles (longest time spent in 1 room was 5 minutes) in my opinion. Once you get to the last part of the game, you cant go back to get anything so you have to start new to try to get more collectables/upgrades. Pick it up when its on sale if you want a decent puzzle game.			",148,22,1,33,6,1,22

												It's a really nice, little game. The pixel art is interesting through adding little effects here and there, like how the background is always moving, yet it's not distracting. It makes a cool visual. The game's setting has an oddly not-so-desolate, metroid-like, planet as a setting, which I'm also a big fan of. Another thing I enjoyed was that all the NPC's were nice little guys, and came some interesting lines, if you went the distance to talk to them. The soundtrack is also really nice, it fits the space theme without being boring. The puzzles (stages that have you use a portal gun to advance) were difficult, but never so hard that I gave up. That was a big one for me, and it probably had to do with how well you could see the puzzle in whole, and the simple mechanics. I really love the puzzles. The story is... not very exisistent. There is some bad guy, Grigori (ugly fellow), who is a total jerk, he blew up your ship, you wreck, so now you have to find him on this planet you wrecked on (I don't know why the bad guy is there, I think we were trying to go to the planet to attack him, buy it's not well explained). It does provide an objective, but it isn't very complicated. In whole, I bought the game for $0.16 (an awesome price), and was surprised. However, the game is really short. My 3 hours were all I needed to beat the game. But, if you're okay with short games, it's a lovely experience. I was only upset at the length to be honest. It feels incomplete,  like a greenlight game. I really want more cool puzzles and funny creatures, but then the games over. I also beleive that with more time it could have a neat little plot to help tie the story together. I just want more. An update with a story that goes somewhere (maybe to other planets) would solve all my issues with this game. There are collectables and an achievement for completing the game under an hour, which make the game more replayable in its defense, but it just won't fill the void.			",45,12,0,11,3,1,4

I got this game for like 70 cents, and if that ain't worth it to you, then what are you doing playing videogames? The narrative is so-so and the art isn't anything we haven't seen before in an indie title, but it's definitely worth it for the fun, satisfying gameplay.			",80,29,0,4,2,2,3

												             One late night, 'Cave Story' wandred into the house, drunk as usual. 'Portal 2' looked up from her magazine, to see the love of her life stumble in through the front door. 'You Have to Win the Game' and 'Risk of Rain' were already asleep, 'Cave Story' arived home too late to say goodnight to either of them. 'Portal 2' looked up at the love of her life and said, ""Were have you been?"" 'Cave Story' looked up, as if surprised to be asked a question as such. ""I was... just out with some Mimigma eating some cake an' stuff... you know the usual."" 'Cave Story' replied. It was the worst lie about cake that 'Portal 2' had ever heard, and even 'Cave Story' knew it. ""Look, I'm sorry, its just that ever sense my fanbase went down, I've never really been the same. We both know how it is..."" 'Cave Story' said, without the courage to look 'Portal 2' in the face. ""Its alright."" 'Portal 2' responded. at this, 'Cave Story' looked up at his wife, as if surprised that she would be so kind to him after what he had done. ""I guess we've both had some screw-ups, but we always manage to pull back out of it."" 'Cave Story' couldnt believe what he was hearing, afterall, 'Portal 2' was still beautiful to him. Her amazing gameplay, memorable charecters, interesting and intreging puzzles. 'Cave Story' knew he had to make this right. ""Look 'Portal 2', I know I've had some screw-ups before, but, what if I make it right for you, tonight."" 'Portal 2' blushed at this remark.

'Cave Story's' amazing gameplay and control, the soundtrack, and the story were enough to make her fall in love with him all over again. ""Alright.""

'Cave Story' smiled and turned off the lights, both of them headed upstairs, and proceded with the game.Nine months later, 'Out There Somewhere' was born.THE END			",73,14,0,9,3,0,0

												Has potential but stays at that. Real pity it is just 1h length. When you start to become interested in the mechanics and the inhabitants of the planet, and even right after getting a hint that maybe later you could come back to a specific place to get some upgrades... game ends.Still, it's $1 so well, worth the money.

												Clever platformer! Great music, graphically simple but still pleasant-looking. Very short but well polished little game. It does a lot with its movement mechanic in a short amount of time.You can probably finish it in an hour, and you will have fun. If you really like it, there's some exploration and achievements to do, and you will have another hour or two of fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I purchased out there somewhere on sale for about 0.19 but wow this game is worth more, maybe not the full 5$ but if you find it on sale take it in a flash.So review, at first i was put off by the graphics and pricing and i tought ""This will just be a broken and/or clunky flash-game-like won't it?"", i was very wrong, this game has the same apeal of games like Cave Story whit a cute but functional ad sometimes gimm pixelart diesign choices and cleverness of puzles of the likes of Portal.This game has some issues tho, a lack of polish and 5$ for an hour game is enough to discourage anyone from buying this game.If the devs choose to expand the campaign with more story and  characters whith different mechanics it may be worth a full price purchase.

												THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!Not a hardcore platformer, more like a puzzle portal-inspired platformer, i love the game it's amazing, the puzzles are well made, easy to solve but tricky to execute, the story is simple but the whole map and the platforming are just outstanding, This reminds me of VVVVVV because all screens have a name, reminds me of portal because of the teleport gun that conservates momentum and cave story for the ligh-hearted story with hardcore challenges that are just there (like speedrun the game in 20min D:It's a gem, i hope it's not a hidden one because it's just amazing, only down side could be that it's short, but i think it doesn't overstays it's welcome, it's a really good game and i didn't feel ripped off for a 1.5h experience because it was a really fun 1.5h unlike other games were you spend that time farming, this has none of that.EDIT: second playthrough, got more achievements, this is awesome!<3			",329,87,6,40,22,5,32

												Neat platformer! The main ""hook"" is a gun with bullets that teleport your character to whatever wall they hit. Pair that with the ability to jump in mid-air immediately after a warp, and it makes for some interesting puzzle platforming shenanagans. It is on the short side and could probably do without the space shooting sections, but for the price you can't go far wrong.			",215,75,4,40,20,0,26

												SHORT REVIEW:This is a solid retro-puzzle/platformer game. It has great gameplay, thoughtful puzzles, top-notch retro soundtrack and while the game is fairly short, the price of the game reflects that. My totaly time for this game to complete all the achievements was 4 hours and that was with a pretty casual mindset, no rushing (a part from the speed run achievement of course).CONCLUSION:No fancy over the top praise, just straight forward: it was a lot of fun and worth the price. I would recommend it if you like this sort of game			",112,19,0,12,5,0,10

												Good platformer that focuses on precision timing. High density of easy and medium difficulty puzzles, no really hard puzzles. Puzzles make good use of the game's unique mechanics and generally feel very fresh and varied. Executing a solution can be very difficult and can get repetitive. Mostly linear with some secret or tricky optional areas. Fast respawn but sometimes areas have checkpoints a minute or two apart, which can introduce a noticable degree of repetition. Art is mixed with some areas having a very atmospheric alien world feel with lots of unique background assets, while some blocks  (such as glass) are crude and don't fit the feel of the rest of the game. I would generally recommend this game to players who enjoy precision puzzle platformers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an awesome little game! It is a hidden little gem i picked up for $0.21. This is a puzzle platformer that is so fun because the puzzles are very satisfying to solve. At the beginning of the game i was a confused but I quickly picked up the game mechanics due to the games perfect learning curve. In other words when the game teaches a new mechanic, it starts off easy until you are familar with the mechanic, then harder till it becomes secondhand knowledge, and THEN thats when the game shows you the next new mechanic. Of course this is not to say that you will never be stumped at some parts, after all it is what makes a puzzle game a puzzle game and takes some creative thinking BUT is never anything ridiculous to solve. The main part about this game that is kept me so hooked were all the puzzles. The harder puzzles are extreamly satisfying to solve (plenty of ""OHHH!!"" moments) and secrets are very rewarding to find. The puzzles in this game will never become stale, thats because even though the puzzles are essentially the same, the variations and new mechanics keep it very fun, enjoyable, and interesting to play. One more thing is that great soundtrack, props to them!PROS-Great learning curve-Puzzles never get boring-New Mechanics add depth-Puzzles are very satisfying to solve-Puzzles are so clever (I know i've said it a bunch but I really love the puzzles!!!)-Great price-Secrets keep the game interesting-Never too easy or too hard-Awesome music to play toCONS-None (I can't complain as the game has everything advertised plus much more and FAR exceded my expectations)The game is short and can not really be a con for being so, as it cost me a mere $0.21. (But the game is so awesome that I wanted more)The reason I have more than 4 hours is because I tried to get all the ""Abandoned Cores"" and ""Ancient Artifacts""Bottomline : get this game while it's still on sale, but if it's not... still get it cause it's awesome.P.S The very beginning with the old arcade shooter mini game is an awesome little ""backstory"" and  an interesting way start off the game and if you survive long enough it will explain what the ""Abandoned Cores"" do and what the boss looks like (you can't defeat him!)

												Have you ever heard someone say a game is ""deceptively simple"" and wondered what that means? This game will answer that for you. I can't tell you how many times during the course of play I stopped, smiled, and thought ""Huh! Clever!"" The main mechanic is somewhat unique, but the implementation and level design is where this game shines. If you stop and think about what you need to accomplish, the ""puzzle"" solves itself with a little bit of platforming savvy. I say ""puzzle"" because deep down this is a puzzle game disguised as a platformer. The enemies are just obstacles to overcome as you try to get from A to B. There are plenty of secrets to warrant a second playthrough (though I haven't done that yet), and just a TINY bit of backtracking, so I guess this could loosely be classified as Metroidvania, but it has a personality all its own. This is well worth the price of admission, even though I played through it in a little over an hour.If you have a couple of bucks you were GOING to spend on coffee, skip that and buy this. You'll thank me later.			",41,4,0,2,4,0,6

												I can't really recommend this game at regular price (2 bucks) but at it's current sale price (50 cents) I guess you can go and nab it. The game's mechanics are sound, the music is nice, and the overall presentation is pretty good, but the major, major flaw of this game is it's length. The whole game from start to finish is a mere hour in length, though if you're a huge completionist you can get some more playtime out of it. When I got to the end of the game, I expected it to continue onward, exploring another world or something, but instead it ends at a cliffhanger and left me wanting more out of it. That would be fine if this was like a demo, but for a full game? Not acceptable.			",42,5,0,3,12,0,3

												Ignore my time played, it's actually over 2 hours since I mostly played offline.This game is a competent puzzle platformer that makes good use of its portal mechanic. While short, it doesn't overstay its welcome and has added replay value in finding the hidden ship parts.  I never felt the game was especially challenging, which may be a pro or a con depending on who you ask.The only real fault I have with the game is the final boss battle, which takes place in a shmup style. It struck me as an odd choice, considering the majority of the game is in a 2D sidescrolling format. I originally purchased this game for $0.49 while on sale, but I still think $2.00 is a reasonable price to pay if you value quality over quantity.			",57,16,0,2,7,0,5

												A puzzle-platformer that takes its cues, self-admittedly, from classics like Super Metroid and contemporaries like VVVVVV.  Has endearing 16-bit animation and music.  Although I feel a bit like I've played it before (see games above), the teleporter gun is a unique change on the tried-and-true Metroidvania gameplay.  And hey, on sale until 4/27/15 for $.19?  There's no reason not to pick it up.  It's definitely an enjoyable experience.			",806,354,14,78,93,14,101

												An hour long game that's divided up into single screen puzzles. Think VVVVVV, but instead of flipping vertically, you teleport horizontally. It's not bad. As far as puzzle platformers go, you could do better (VVVVVV), but you could also do so much worse. If this game goes on sale for 19 cents again, make sure you get it. Even if you don't like it, you can sell back the steam trading cards and practically break even.			",73,11,1,7,4,0,3

I had no idea it was a puzzle game until I failed this rail-shooter style level and was thrust into an excellent puzzle game. It only takes about an hour and a half but the difficulty level was just right. Finally, I love the fact that they implemented rail-shooter mechanics as it gave the story a great start and end. Even if it was $4.99 I would buy it again.			",26,3,3,3,1,0,0

												- Very cheap; €0,99 when off sale, on sale €0,24.- The story is interesting and on point.- The overall feeling of the game is phenomenal, the music contributes a lot to this feeling.- The gameplay is very simple but incredibly fun at times. The game represents a blend of action and puzzle-solving elements.- During the first run, on average, the game takes around 3 hours to complete (if you take things slowly and enjoy the game to its maximum); after that first try, you could pass the game in under 20 minutes.You really should buy this game, mostly because it is very cheap and you will get excellent value for your money.

												Have you ever heard someone say a game is ""deceptively simple"" and wondered what that means? This game will answer that for you. I can't tell you how many times during the course of play I stopped, smiled, and thought ""Huh! Clever!"" The main mechanic is somewhat unique, but the implementation and level design is where this game shines. If you stop and think about what you need to accomplish, the ""puzzle"" solves itself with a little bit of platforming savvy. I say ""puzzle"" because deep down this is a puzzle game disguised as a platformer. The enemies are just obstacles to overcome as you try to get from A to B. There are plenty of secrets to warrant a second playthrough (though I haven't done that yet), and just a TINY bit of backtracking, so I guess this could loosely be classified as Metroidvania, but it has a personality all its own. This is well worth the price of admission, even though I played through it in a little over an hour.If you have a couple of bucks you were GOING to spend on coffee, skip that and buy this. You'll thank me later.			",41,4,0,2,4,0,6

												Very short cute game. You can finish it in two hours. Graphics is not bad, but not incredible. Mechanics with jumping and teleporting make the game enjoyable. Story very shalow. Villain attacks your side, you have to go after him all alone. We don't know who your side is. Could be evil intergalactic empire populated by good ordinary people doing their jobs and the villain a freedom fighter who dares to defy the ruling empire. Of course he is used to being on the other side of the law so he looks like a pirate and its given him a bad rep. While you the hero are  a overzealous enforser of the said empire and you don't see how in the long run the empire is trampling on the lowest developed worlds while the prosperous worlds keep getting prosperous. Like I said shalow story, lost potential. Get the game at a discount and it doesn't matter its short. TL;DR Fun platformer game. Very short. Find it on a discount and buy it.			",81,50,0,25,12,1,11

												I can't really recommend this game at regular price (2 bucks) but at it's current sale price (50 cents) I guess you can go and nab it. The game's mechanics are sound, the music is nice, and the overall presentation is pretty good, but the major, major flaw of this game is it's length. The whole game from start to finish is a mere hour in length, though if you're a huge completionist you can get some more playtime out of it. When I got to the end of the game, I expected it to continue onward, exploring another world or something, but instead it ends at a cliffhanger and left me wanting more out of it. That would be fine if this was like a demo, but for a full game? Not acceptable.			",42,5,0,3,12,0,3

												Ignore my time played, it's actually over 2 hours since I mostly played offline.This game is a competent puzzle platformer that makes good use of its portal mechanic. While short, it doesn't overstay its welcome and has added replay value in finding the hidden ship parts.  I never felt the game was especially challenging, which may be a pro or a con depending on who you ask.The only real fault I have with the game is the final boss battle, which takes place in a shmup style. It struck me as an odd choice, considering the majority of the game is in a 2D sidescrolling format. I originally purchased this game for $0.49 while on sale, but I still think $2.00 is a reasonable price to pay if you value quality over quantity.			",57,16,0,2,7,0,5

												Although the game is fairly short, it is still a very fun game that I look forward to playing many more times in the future. I dont know wether or not i would pay the full $5 for this game, but as it is on sale for 19¢ I would recomend everyone to buy it.			",38,5,0,2,2,0,3

												A pleasant surprise of a game that I bought on super sale. Not really a Metroidvania, more a puzzle-platformer with a bit of exploration thrown in. The main mechanic - a teleport gun - is mined for all its worth. When I finished my first playthrough I was eager to take on the challenge achievements.Don't be thrown off by the R-Type opening sequence. It's easily the game's weakest feature and not representative of the quality spritework in the main game. Overall a solid game well worth its low price.			",123,60,0,12,5,2,10

												Originally, I jsut bought this because it was on sale for $.019 so why not, right? But I played it and it's actually a really great game. I had no idea it was a puzzle game until I failed this rail-shooter style level and was thrust into an excellent puzzle game. It only takes about an hour and a half but the difficulty level was just right. Finally, I love the fact that they implemented rail-shooter mechanics as it gave the story a great start and end. Even if it was $4.99 I would buy it again.			",26,3,3,3,1,0,0

												I found this game to be enjoyable. It's a platformer first and foremost, but incorporates a little bit of puzzle/item hunting as well. Although short, the game itself is well-designed. The bit-tune music is enjoyable and the reponsiveness to inputs on my 360 controller were nearly perfect. It took me a little less than 1 hour to beat, but I hear there is more worth going back for the achievements, missed secrets.Overall, well worth the pricetag.			",72,14,1,21,9,0,9

												A great puzzle-platformer with a fun central concept (a teleporter gun that preserves vertical momentum). I had a lot of fun with it and find that it has a lot of speedrun value. Also, the hidden pickups and achievements (at least one of which requires you to traverse most of the game without hitting a checkpoint, providing a fiendish challenge) give the completionists among us something to do. For two bucks - I believe I even got it on sale for twenty cents - you've no reason not to pick it up.			",68,13,0,5,1,0,5

My only complaint was that you couldn't remap the walk keys from the arrow keys are bind to ',.; keys, but it wasn't a huge issue since there's only 3 key bindings that you need other than the walk keys. Worth noting that it is a short game, but what can you expect for a dollar.			",165,43,2,13,12,0,15

												Out there somewhere is a simple yet interesting 2d retro platformer. It has some cool mechanics that are easy to understand but hard to master. The level design is good, the levels are moderately difficult while remaining mostly good looking. The music and sounds are reminiscent of the sounds of old 8-bit and 16-bit titles, allmost to an anoying extent. The main selling point of this game however, for me, was the incredibly low price. Get this on sale if you have 20 cents to spend.			",40,11,0,13,11,0,6

Even though it's a short game, for the price you can get it for right now, which is 19 cents, it's more than worth it. Plus you get trading cards that you can sell on the market.By the way, for all the achievement hunters out there, once you master the game's mechanics I think you'll find that if you replay it, you'll know how to get to areas you hadn't been to before, so that's totally worth checking out. I love secrets. Don't you?			",85,23,2,10,3,1,5

												Just another puzzle platformer, if a well-executed one. This is only a metroidvania if you consider finding a single upgrade and collecting hidden things that have no immediate benefit (and no meaningful benefit in the long run either) to be enough to call it one of those (and I don't).Basically, this is a game that belongs on Kongregate or Armor Games but decided to ask people to pay money for it on Steam instead of tolerating ads to play it at one of those places. I got the achievement for beating the game in under an hour without actually trying to do so, which should tell you just how little content it has.All the same, it's fun for what it is. If it looks like you'll like it and its current price looks super cheap to you, go on and get it.			",155,29,0,29,6,0,11

												Out There Somewhere is a great puzzle game, and has a really cool mechanic of teleportation. The game is really simplistic and a fun challenge. It is a very short game though, I personally finished in abut 3 hours.I don't happen to mind though as i got this game for 19 cents, and i had like 30 cents from steam trading cards. For $5 this game is worth it if you like puzzle games or games of this ""feel.""			",114,14,1,25,5,2,7

												It took me 77 minutes to beat the game. But man was that possibly in the top of the best 77 minutes of video gaming I've ever video gamed. The pixelish graphics were nice to look at. The music was really good and added to the vibe. The gameplay was pretty innovative, easy to learn, and most of all fun. I had almost given up in those last 5 minutes because I died to the final boss around 15 times in near rapid succession. But that sense of triumph I felt upon beating the game just cannot be matched. 10/10/10Edit: The game says I beat it in under an hour so that's cool. Everything still applies and I will definitely be going back to attempt 100%			",131,18,0,16,8,1,14

												Time of review: in 2 hours even, last room before the final boss; putting aside b/c bored and ♥♥♥♥ that last puzzle.TL;DR: twitch based puzzle plafomer, think VVVVVV with fancier graphics, no exploration aspect, and different mechanics.1st off: unlike what the tags currently say; this is not in any way a metroidvania, metroidvanias are distinguished by a big focus on exploration, ferreting out secrets, etc. You don't do that in OTS, the game is very linear, backtracking is impossible, etc. Its similar to a metroidvania in the sense that there is just 1 big map... but thats about it.What the game actually is at heart is a fairly difficult puzzle platformer, with a big focus on the platforming, you WILL need some good twitch skills to get thru some of the mid/late game rooms. Think VVVVVV except instead of swapping gravity you jump, shoot, & teleport, and you'll have a good idea.Oh, and also there are space shooter sequences right at the beginning & end.If you want a cheap, short, challenging game to kill a weekend afternoon, this is a good buy. Just be aware its only around 2 hours or so for a playthru, the platforming is very twitch, and it aint got any exploration.			",242,55,0,57,10,0,41

												Hows this for a strange playthrough experience?I bought the game expecting nothing out of a cheap 2D platformer, but it had Trading Cards and Achievements so I thought why not? I started the game up and played through the first few screens until I got stuck at the first puzzle because I'm an idiot and I closed the game. I didn't touch it for a week and a half.Soon I was sitting in my chair hovering my mouse cursor over the 'Refund' button before deciding to launch the game a final time. If I couldn't figure out how to get past the puzzle in 10 minutes, I would get a refund and buy a trading card or something with the $0.49 I spent on the game. I ended up figuring out how to get through the level and I kept playing until the very end of the game. I then regretted not buying the game at full-price after I finished it, when just an hour ago I was about to refund it. It's not a very long game, but I think that's intentional. It's a game that deserves to be disected and studied. I've beaten the game six times in five hours, with one of my playthroughs being as short as 17 minutes and 42 seconds. I still keep going back and beating it again and again. This little indie game has me bewildered. It's addictively fun and perfectly difficult. It's the type of difficulty that doesn't take it easy on you but doesn't discourage you from retrying and you end up hooked. It's just short enough to not get boring too quick and just long enough to stay fresh throughout multiple playthroughs. The puzzles are ridiculously fun to solve while the 8bit score is blasting through your speakers. The game is packed full of secret areas and hidden collectibles that are easy to find if you know the game's tricks. Every single screen you come across has some sort of hidden entrance to a secret zone. The mechanics are inventive, fresh, and tight. The slow-moving projectiles of the portal gun give you time to think where you're going next and pull of some pretty incredible mid-air stunts if you're good enough. The control layout is of a standard arcade cabinent (I played with a controller however). Simplisity is key with this game, and that's not a bad thing.8.4/10 - tl;dr : The game will surprise you. It's packed with secrets and has a great soundtrack. The gameplay is addictively fun and inventive, with that Mario Brothers / Dark Souls type of difficulty that keeps you hooked. Short, but fun to replay over and over again if you're an achievement hunter.NOTE: I got a free Steam Key for another game called ""Polarity"" when I opened the game the first time. That right there in itself is worth 49 cents in my humble opinion. That, and the free soundtrack folder that comes with the games files.			",57,14,0,3,2,0,1

												Just another puzzle platformer, if a well-executed one. This is only a metroidvania if you consider finding a single upgrade and collecting hidden things that have no immediate benefit (and no meaningful benefit in the long run either) to be enough to call it one of those (and I don't).Basically, this is a game that belongs on Kongregate or Armor Games but decided to ask people to pay money for it on Steam instead of tolerating ads to play it at one of those places. I got the achievement for beating the game in under an hour without actually trying to do so, which should tell you just how little content it has.All the same, it's fun for what it is. If it looks like you'll like it and its current price looks super cheap to you, go on and get it.			",155,29,0,29,6,0,11

												I bought Out There Somewhere for 19 cents and then sold the trading cards, so I had already got my use out of it.But then I played it.And I wish I had played full price for it.Beautiful pixel graphics, a wonderful, creative (if slightly repetitive) sound-track, but the platforming in this game is something special. Slightly short, though; I would pay upwards of $20 for a longer sequel of this game.You are Yuri. The evil Space-lord Grigori is plotting world demise, and you must stop him armed with only your little spacecraft, upgrading your ship along the way.Sadly, your attack on his massive spaceship fails. Whether you got shot down during the first wave of his fleet or got taken down by that massive laser on Grigori's ship (NO, YOU CAN'T BEAT HIM. I'VE TRIED.) you crash land on a seemingly in-hospitable planet below. Armed with only your Teleport Gun, you must find a Lightorb, which will fix your ship and let you finally defeat Grigori.Straight away, death threatens you as the obstacles you face are not only creative, but exciting. The only thing I disliked about Portal 2 was how hair-rippingly difficult some of the puzzles were. The puzzles in OTS are fast-paced, involving quick turns, movements, and the use of momentum. This means, that if you jump just before your Tele-bullet hits a wall, you will continue traveling upwards, leaving for some interesting platforming.There are a massive amount of secrets hidden in this game, all which help unlock achievements and make the game easier for you. I won't spoil any of them, obviously. What, you thought you could cheat through by reading this? Ha! No secrets for you.Got a few spare bucks in your wallet? Try Out There Somewhere. You won't regret it.			",38,5,2,0,3,0,7
