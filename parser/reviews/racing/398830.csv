												Wasn't sure whether to write a review for this game, but given that I review everything I ""play""....This game just does not run properly. I only managed 9 minutes of game play that did not explain the objective of the game. The game is played in third person view of your vehicle/tank(?) and you move around destroying objects and portals...that is about as much as I could work out from the little time I had to play. After finding out the character just gets stuck on any object you crash into and no way to move yourself off of it, the only way is to exit the game and restart... Upon doing this though, we found that the game just constantly crashes when starting over. The first sign of this happening is all of the text just disappears, and half of the UI does not even show on the screen. The game then literally just crashes to desktop and I am now in constant loop of this happening with no way of getting it to stop. The only slightly redeeming factor of Goggles - World of Vaporia is the unique and jazzy soundtrack, there is nothing at all I would put down as a positive for this title other than that. The price tag of £14,99 is absurd for a broken game. I am surprised this game isn't in early access as I would have forgiven these downfalls but this is supposed to be a fully completed released game that just doesn't work. Until the game has been patched/fixed, stay away. If the developers are to see this review, if you fix the issues and want me to revisit my review, I am more than happy to.   Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

												Interesting game, feels a bit like Banjo Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts, minus the crafting/quests.


YouTube™ Video: Goggles World of Vaporia Gameplay PC HD [60FPS/1080p]

			Goggles World of Vaporia PC Gameplay 1080p 60fps Platform: PC Video Game Genre: Action, Adventure, Racing Developer: Bit2Good Ug Release Date: 9 Oct, 2015 Steam:...		

All 4 characters are available from the start, each have alternate vehicles, weapons and overdrive powers. Combining these together means multiplayer should work well, though unfortunately I was unable to find players. Initially one arena is available with more available through game progression. Restricted by a global timer and locked gates, each level has 3 areas filled with enemies. Clearing out 'voids' raises a percentage and hitting certain targets rewards further access to the map. Once all 3 were cleared a boss spawns that requires killing to complete the level.Graphically it looks quite beautiful but I do feel the gameplay becomes a bit rinse repeat. While a few different 'mini games' were available that decreased the global timer, still ultimately killing enemy XYZ or collecting random items. Story was all voiced, most characters sounded okay while some were a little rough. Game runs on unity, supports screen resolutions of 4k+ along with full controller remapping in-game. Few framedrops on a single 970 though it was nothing gamebreaking.Overall a fun game in short bursts, just feel like it could have offered much more. Maybe some more meaningful quests, clearing voids and reducing global timers through group and mini-boss fights does get a little stale. If it were $15 or less, would be a solid recommend. With all the above mentioned and nobody yet playing multiplayer, it might be worth wishlisting instead if funds are a tight. Copy was provided by developer, doesn't change my thoughts. Cheers.

												[Could include spoilers]Truth be told, ""Goggles - World of Vaporia"" is not your new ""100 Metascore"" - game. It has its Flaws. For instance:Sometimes I keep getting lost in the different districts, especially in the inventors district (... well, to be fair: even if you're new to that game your only possibility to get lost is the inventors district. The other maps are quite easy to remember and manuever through as there is more open space). Furthermore I sometimes do not recognize that an enemy hit me. For example when Mr. King (I believe his name was) punches the floor, causing something like an earthquake in progress, which damages your character. I took me some time to realize that (but to be fair, it just could have been me who wasn't paying attention). .... To be honest here, these are the major things that could ""annoy"" me. There are more things I like about this game than I ""hate"". I like the way it looks and how the different characters play differently (It's the same with the boss battles, btw). E.g. Quentin and Tesla do not play the same way. With Quentin I can kill my opponents from a distance (which is a wise thing to do by the way) while I have to rush at my enemies with Tesla. Frank is a more tanky character which can be usefull when you're playing with friends. Haven't touched Vules yet, though... In addition I have to admit that I love the dialogues between the characters (ingame as well as in cutscenes). They really do make me smirk. The voice acting is not bad, too, as it fits the ""Steam punk and industrialization"" setting well. Also, the Soundtrack, especially the menu Song, is very catchy ~ So, although it has its flaws and mistakes it is a good game you can play with your friends as well as all alone. (It's better with friends, though)			",83,4,0,3,3,0,3

												First impression: Goggles - World of Vaporia is a fun light harted game with lots of charm and unique ideas. The story brings you to the steampunk planet Vaporia where evertything's run by machines. After an incident all machines become possessed and start attacking everything. The levels, while a bit difficult to navigate at times, are a joy to look at and the art style overall fits the setting nicely. Nothing in this game looks generic.The four characters seem to be specialized for specific tasks in the game which makes me think that the focus of the game is more on multiplayer co-op. That said, single player is still fun, just a bit harder when playing Tesla or Vules Jerne. The weapons you can use reach from rocket launcher and steam hammer to cannons and a zapper gun just to mention some of them.The dialogues between the characters, which are all voiced btw, are funny and continue telling the story during gameplay and in comic cutscenes between the levels. The cutscenes themselves are all hand drawn and really add to the overall atmosphere of the game. Speaking of atmosphere: the colors and light effects change the more dangerous the level gets, which looks pretty cool.Also, the soundtrack deserves a mention: It sounds great and I've had it stuck in my head for days now. Especially since I found out the Wise Guys are featured in the title track!!			",2,0,0,1,0,0,0

												I played the game for several times and I have to say, I really like the artstyle of this game. For an Indiegame (in 3D) it has beautiful designed characters and landscapes. The controls were a little bit clumsy in the beginning, but with the updates and a short training I get used to it. I will try to post some Let's Play Videos.One is allready done:

												Goggles – World of Vaporia was a game that really fascinated me when I was performing research on indie games for Steamified to cover. There was clearly a lot that I found appealing about the game. Thus, when I finally got my hands on the game I was filled with excitement and hope. Unfortunately, it turned into one of the more disappointing titles that I have reviewed. But there is much potential about the game if the major weakness that I find in the game is improved significantly.I dearly love the way in which the game is introduced. The comic is absolutely a smart way of creating an introductory cut scene. The atmosphere of the game is immediately set and there’s quite a lot of hope that you will become immersed deeply into the game once it is finished and you’re finally beginning the game. The soundtrack is a highlight that contributes to the positive atmosphere of the game. I’m glad that the soundtrack is available for sale on Steam but I’d like to have seen a bundle (game plus soundtrack) deal instead of just selling the soundtrack individually. The atmosphere is there throughout the game and this is quite frankly the biggest advantage that the title currently has going for it.My biggest criticism of the game is in its control and camera set ups. The game supports controller as well as keyboard and mouse play. The problem is that neither of them felt comfortable. I didn’t find the controller was nearly accurate or fluid enough. I found myself having enormous difficulty using the weapons accurately with the controller. It’s simple enough to fire your weapon pressing the right and left bumpers but it felt clumsy and very inaccurate. Aiming the camera in the right direction was very difficult and I didn’t know when I was actually in the direction that I wanted to shoot. Driving was also an issue with the controller with the keyboard driving much more accurately. When using keyboard and mouse I found that it altered the camera too much. With no option to turn down mouse sensitivity this made play highly frustrating yet not impossible.Another negative towards the game – which would be remedied by an increased player base (before I played the peak number of players for the day was zilch, zero, nada and had been that way for at least two weeks according to SteamSpy. Unfortunately, the number of owners (343 to 1061) doesn’t scream that that is likely to change very much in the immediate future. For a game that bills itself as a cross-platform multiplayer arena game it is another disappointing sign. Unfortunately, I believe that Bit2Good Ug priced themselves out of the market with the Steam release.When you’re attempting to combine the mechanics of a racing game and a shooter, two genres that demand accuracy, and it is your greatest weakness it makes it difficult to recommend. Sadly, the game hasn’t had an update since October 29th. Although it has potential to be a very good indie game I fear that it wont get there. Unfortunately, it isn’t worth the current price of US$19.99. There are much better games available on Steam that don’t have close to the same asking price. This is the same asking price for  Resident Evil 0, Rocket League and Rust to name just three which offer players much more value at that price. Given that the developers have taken advantage of Steamworks the next logical marketing steps for the game would be to lower the price, introduce a 4-pack (4 for the price of 3 at the new price), add it to the Steam weekly sales with a 25 or 50% discount (when the 4-pack is introduced and have that discounted as well). I’d then revisit the game a month after these changes take place before considering the bundle sites and if nothing has changed then insert it into a bundle (Bundle Stars preferably).To leave this review on a positive note, which I’ll always endeavor to do, the atmosphere, sound track and the comic features of the game are highlights and kudos must absolutely be given for them. World of Vaporia is the debut Steam title of Bit2Good Ug and shows that the developer has potential. I’ll eagerly await future titles with the hopes that the studio’s potential is fulfilled.For similar reviews and our popular giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/ ",2243,882,89,270,267,28,370
