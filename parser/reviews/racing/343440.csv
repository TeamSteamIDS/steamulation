Crash Drive 2 is a fun racing game with a neat multiplayer built-in. Racing is easy, enjoyable, the maps are big and there are really only minor flaws which shouldn't break your gameplay experience.Enough talk, let's get to the pros and cons:Pros: A nice cartoonish art style A lot of game modes and areas Many different vehicles with different advantages and disadvantages Random events occur in mid-game that encourage players to compete Levels are huge and even include secret areas! System requirements are low. No more problems with friends with bad computers! This game also supports Linux and MacOS, which is a huge plus for some people Full controller support Trading Cards, achievements and even leaderboards! It's cheap + you get an extra copy when you buy the game!Cons: You can fall off the map. They tried to make it fun with an achievement, but this is still not a nice bug. It's not a big deal, though. The graphic menu is really hard to reach. At first, I didn't think there even are any options for graphics. Then I found that there are written instructions on how to change the resolution and quality. After you press ""Play"" on Steam, you have to hold the Shift button until the menu appears. It is a classic Unity graphics menu, which is fine. There is only one option to upgrade the car: to the highest level. There are literally two options: normal and maximally upgraded. However, upgrading cars is not the point of the game. No biggie. Camera angles can sometimes be a bit funny as you can't control your point of view with your mouse. But only happens when you are making sudden 180° turns.The final verdict:The point of this game is not to be mentally fulfilled and inspired, but to have fun. And this is really well done. The only thing I missed is easy access to the graphic menu, but you really only need to do that once. Once I have set things up properly, there were no game-breaking bugs or anything illogical happening. I can see myself playing this for a lot of hours. The community is active right now and I hope it doesn't start to lose players.Greetings,BirdCuteNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

												Hello,  My name is PIG! Let me tell you why CD2 is easily, my most favorite game.  Most people think the game is over after they achieve 100% game progress. In my opinion, that's when it really begins. I've been playing for several years now, and I'm still learning new things each time I play.  All vehicles have their own uniqueness, or personality. With 30 vehicles to choose from, it is very easy to find one that fits my style of play, if not several. What's most impressive, is how well the vehicles and terrain work together. They both compliment the other very nicely. The controls are very simple, so children can easily master any vehicle. The complexity of the terrian, and physics of the vehicles, make the game very fun. I have the choice of 4 maps, with lots of hills, ramps, loops, and events. Aside from the main focus of game play, there are hidden locations, and secret ways of getting on top of the rock walls, loops, and structures. I can be as competitive, or as laid back as I want to be.   There is a ""Join Friend"" option that allows users to play with family and friends. My children enjoy the game just as much, and they love to run over their Daddy. Last family game night, there were 5 of us in the same map. That's pretty awesome. This game deserves the highest rating in my opinion; because it has proven itself over and over to be dependble, and consistant throughout all of the platforms that I play on. The event pay outs, as well as the rewards for stunting add up very quickly. There are rocky points, and grey areas in every game. Any issues that I have encountered in the past have been due to connection issues on my end. 5 stars A++   ",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a Linux gamer, there aren't many games where the main character has wheels, so for me, this was a no-brainer. I have had fun for the short time I've put in today. I don't think I'd sit around playing it for hours on end, but I'll definitely load it up when I just want to race around hitting jumps, collecting coins, and playing tag with people online.Considering the low asking price for this game, I think this is worth checking out if you are looking for a fun diversion for a few minutes of racing here and there. The free gift copy included with every purchase is a brilliant strategy, and will hopefully pay off by keeping the seamlessly automated online matches happening for a long time to come.

												This game really surprised me. Basically drive around, go through rings and do stunts, and every once in a while a challenge happens where you can earn money to buy more cars. However, the twist is that everything is online and you are competing with other players in the open world. It is very addicting. My only complaint is that the controls with a controller could be better (such as being able to use buttons/triggers to accelerate instead of the control pad/stick), but I wouldn't be surprised if that is patched soon. Overall, an excellent buy for 5 bucks (the current non-sale price).			",474,109,19,42,21,5,69

												Crash Drive 2: Great game, but not worth the price. No offense, but this is a VERY shallow game. The gameplay is great, but enough with the jabber. If you want to play this game, go to your browser or get on your phone. Why? BECAUSE IT DOSEN'T COST YOU A DIME. NOPE. COMPLETLY FREE ON APPLE, ANDROID, AND TO PLAY IN INTERNET BROWSERS. I feel ashamed to have spent money on this. Another note: It took me about 4 hours to complete all the objectives.			",70,13,3,6,6,2,7

												Just finished playing this game to completion (upgrading all cars, etc), and I have to say it was pretty cool.Items of note for you who are interested:• It's an online game - you connet to servers (JP, EU or US based on your locale), so ultimately it's a multiplayer, like a simple version of Trackmania or similar.• Graphically, it's not going to blow your socks off [mobile port I believe], but it makes up for that in charm, with 30 different vehicles, each with their own characteristics (engine sounds, horns, boost effects, handling).• While only 4 tracks, and a tank battle level, there are various things you do in each one, from collecting coins, accumulating stunt points, racing, tagging objects, find the ring, and king of the crown, it doesn't get too boring if you like to be competitive, and in there to enjoy the game.• No in level or lobby for chat! A MP game like this could benefit so much from this, would make it's stay a lot more welcome, something I'd come back to if it had this. • There are a few glitches - getting stuck in certain places, points sometimes mess-up in the tag matches, and sometimes you lose connection to the server (that last one doesn't affect your progress, so don't freak out) - but I was able to overlook this as didn't have high expectations of a game that's only like $5I really enjoyed this game, and if things like chat/interaction with players was added, more levels, and some of the glitches were fixed (points-glitch in particular), this would be something I'd see people stick around to play longer. Recommended game - 2-pack for $5 is a no-brainer - dive in with a mate, and get playing!			",1569,695,73,134,55,17,121

												Don't get fooled by the positive reviews like i was. Everything about this game is very shallow.There are 4 worlds(maps), but they aren't very big at all, they are actually rather small and the first world(Canyon) is actually rather tiny.There are 30 cars, but they are all pretty much the same with next to NO diffrence in stats (There are no stats, all of the cars control the same except the later cars are sligtly faster then the beggining cars).The only car stats is that the cars are devided in three categories: Light, Medium, Heavy. The problem is that they all control the same with the only difference being that the Light cars are a slightly faster, the Heavy cars are a slightly better at stunting and the Medium ones are somewhere in the middle(aleast from what i have seen, this is never explained in-game).The mechanics are shallow. You can only do backflips, frontflips and move the car left or right doing 180, 360, 720 and 1080 turns midair(sorry, i don't know whats the real name of that trick if it even has one). The cars fly around on even the slightest bump and that can get annoying.There are 6 minigames(events) that happen randomly in the game but most are very shallow. Here is why:1. Find the ring event: There are always a few rings in every world, and when this event starts one of those rings turns blue and you have to get to it first in order to win. The problem is that the player who is closest to the ring will probably win (unless the closest player makes some stupid mistake) so its completly luck based.2. Racing event: All you have to do is go thru all of the checkpoints to win. The problem is that ALL of these races take place on the flat terrain on the maps instead of useing any of the many props in the worlds so they are rather boring.But the BIGGEST problem is that ALL of these races are very short, they last around 30 to 40 seconds. That happens because, again, the worlds are rather small.3. Tag event: You have to stunt on as many of the props(and thus ''tag'' them) and you have to have the most props tagged before time runs out in order to win.This event isn't actually all that bad. It makes sense that such an event exists since this game has alot of focus on stunting.The only problem is that 2/4 worlds have specific places that you kinda have to go to in order to win cause they are filled with props.4. Stunt event: Get the most amount of points by stunting before time ends.This isn't HORRIBLE, but its shallow because you can easily win most of the matches by just doing the same stunt over and over again.5. King of the crown: A random player gets the crown and has to keep it for 60 seconds to win, and the other players can win by hitting the player with the crown so they can take it.It sounds good on paper but because of the mechanics and the fact that on even the slightest bump your car flyes around, it can be a pain sometimes to hit the guy with the crown, and 50% of the time the guy who randomly gets the crown at the start is the one who wins.6. Coin collect event: Collect the most amount of coins before the time ends to win.This one is completly fine, no real problems with it.There are some bugs, most aren't all that annoying except the bug where you clip thru a prop and usually you are stuck there then you have to re-enter the world, thus you lose the event.There is usually more then enough players in the game playing so don't ever enter an empty server(but sometimes when you are not playing at peak hours there won't be more then 6 players on any server).There is no way to comunicate with other players.The graphics are mobile tier(thats because this is a port of the mobile version of the game), but thats not important. What IS important is the sound, and the sounds are OK, but the music gets repetitive.There is also a seprate Tank Battle mode, but its nohing special. You start with the regular tank, you can buy 4 diffrent tank that all have diffrent stats(Yes, the tanks have actual stats).You have around 5 VERY tiny areas that are in the sky, and the way you win is by shooting another player so that he flys out of the area and then that gets counted as a kill (yes, you just push them, they don't actually explode).As you may see, the Tank Battle mode isn't all that great and there are other games (and mods for other games) that do a better job, but its not bad. Its OK.But do you want to know the BIGGEST problem with the game? The game can be played for FREE on Android/Iphone AND it can be played for free on the web browser! So this game, even with the free copy, isn't worth 1 euro, let alone 5 ♥♥♥♥ING EUROS.			",134,22,3,15,2,0,8

												I love this game! I didn't really like the trailer so I was icky about buying this game but it was on deal and I had money in my steam wallet and it came with a fee gift for my friend so I thought why the heck not? I got it and was blown away about how much fun it was! It even came with a mini-game where you Battle as Tanks! It has events like collect the most coins, tag the most objects, race, etc. I highly recommend this game and if you love it too, give this game some love and give it a thumbs up!

												The good +10 points!This game is very fun, It can be hard to complete everything to go to the next level, tank mode is funny, you start with a good coin bunus so you can buy tank almost right away, to unlock special cars you beat them in a race on a level. There are 4 places, and 1 tank battle place. Oh, and to unlock tank mode I belive you need to beat the first map, just collect the rings, win a few events, and thats about all to unlock tank mode! This game always makes me come back for more!A hintIf you can't reach a ring try again using boost a second before you hit the ramp. Also a maxed out car might be needed, just use your boost and drift to upgrade your car faster!The bad (Not much at all) -0.5 pointsOnly down side you can't directly join a friend with ""join game"" You need to be in the right map their in, and spell their in-game name in, no *Friends list* as of right now.My rating9.5/10 Highly recomend!

												Frantic, fast-paced, bright, colorful, incredibly fun and addictive. ... How many other games do you know of that let you do backflips in a schoolbus? It may look and feel like a mobile game, but don't be fooled. There's plenty of content here to keep you occupied for hours. There's around 30 different vehicles, all of which fit within three different classes and can be maxed out in terms of stats (speed, handling, boost, etc). The core game itself spans across four very different and unique levels, all of which are played online with others in lobbies supporting up to 10 players (roughly) each. The gameplay consists of freeroam mixed with about four or five quick events that are constantly playing on rotation during gameplay that anybody else in the same lobby / map  can participate in. Each event is unique in its own way, and are a complete blast to play. Oh yeah. There's also a bonus unlockable tank battle gamemode which by itself is almost a completely different game that is quite honestly insanely addictive and fun. I really don't think I've ever had so much fun with a mobile port before.I almost feel bad for having purchased this on sale!			",287,37,55,12,26,5,15

												This game, despite being an obvious mobile port with graphics from the early 2000's, is actually somewhat competent. It features multiple large hub worlds where players can participate in events. The playerbase is actually not bad (in the few hundreds) because of crossplatform support with mobile. That being said it really isn't up to the quality that I expect from steam games.			",638,168,18,57,56,10,122

												BUAHAHAHAHA.....SMASH ! This game is so much fun, and addictive at first. I'm not really concerned with leveling or money, i like to spend my time smashing into the other players that are trying to make that money, smashing into them while they race, or do stunts. It's to easy, they need a challenge, lol. This game is so much fun ! There are tons of cars, and i like the leveling system, it's fast to level up your cars once purchased, but getting the money to purchase the cars can get a bit boring after while with only 4 worlds and each having the same thing...stunt mode, crown, tag, etc. But the maps are fairly large and easily playable by many other players at the same time. I also don't get road rage in this one because you don't die, or have to repair your car, you just take a hit, bounce around a bit, honk your horn and chase the person down, lol. For a driving game it's a real pleasure to play. You can really make some good money in the game to purchase more cars if you enter all the events and do well, and the more cars you buy the faster you level up and unlock more cars, once the cars are unlocked you just need to earn the cash to buy them. The only downside to the game is there are only 4 worlds, plus the battle tank level...now there's some fun too. And the repeating events tends to get boring after while, but that's when i just relax and smash the other players, or chase them with the police car, lol. Just buy the game, it's cheap, and you get a free copy to give a friend...awesome !			",259,73,7,25,24,1,23

												My steam collection seems like an uncharted territory full of titles that I've never heard of. Sometimes I just pick a random one, run it, and expect nothing. Optimism was never my strong suit after all. So, I run Crash Drive 2. Expecting the worst.I entered the menu of the game, exhaled with irritation. Everything looked unpolished to the point that I felt like pressing quit instantly.I am glad and lucky I did not. You see, yeah there are all kinds of problems here, interface wise. But, buuuuut, and that is a big but (I like that point in every review I write. I like it, and I cannot lie). The core gameplay mechanics are pure bliss, fun, or any other similar word you could put there to simulate a happy warm fuzzy feeling in your gut.There is the stage, open not linear, and the players with their cars in it. Driving around, roaming freely. Then the events start to come, one after the other. King, with a crown and all, every other car chasing you to get it from you. The winner will be the one left wearing it proudly on his/her hood.Stunt contest? Sure, there is that as well. Racing? Yeap, this is a random event that just may happen. Also it is the one event you can opt out for the round, if you wish.Play play play this game, if you love fun racing titles. Do not let the sloppy interface put you off. The heart of Crash Drive 2 is golden.One last thing. The in game invite friend system does not seem to work. You have to invite your friends via steam, in order to play with them. In fact the best way is to start a game and then the rest of the group join that game you created, via Steam not inside the Crash Drive 2 menu. Cumbersome? Yeap. Sloppy? Sure sure. But if you have friends who own the game you have to play it with them. If you do not have friends who own the game gift it to them. If you don't have friends, go make some. And then play Crash Drive 2 together.			",1114,398,39,134,92,14,132

												Love this game! Addictive! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!It's the first driving game I've found that has a nice feel to the vehicle handling for keyboard input (I have no controller, keyboard only :)I'm a big (HUGE!) fan of the old classic arcade sit-down driver RUSH The Rock - Alcatraz edition and this game sucked me in just like they did back then. - Nice job Devs! -Now, lets nit-pick a little...The red banner that appears for events should be semi-transparent, it blocks too much of your view. This wouldn't be bad but since game play continues as the banner is displayed it is disruptive of game play. The text should be solid and the banner transparent.Not sure how the 'points' are added up for when you can or can't 'steal' a tagged item, but it seems unfair at times.Needs some more things to buy or spend your $ on after you've maxed all your vehicles, I have nothing to do with my $10M - Some vehicle skins to buy, Extra Boost time or faster Boost regeneration, I'm sure there's lots more that could be done to use up some $.Some events glitch once in a while, but perfectly acceptable if they don't cause the game to stop events all together, which does happen once in a blue moon. As I said though it's not a big problem, simply exit and rejoin hopefully getting into a new group of players.'King of the Crown' events, YES! Love it! There are times when another driver doesn't even get close to you (or it appears) but they still get the crown from you. Not a biggie here either, just go get it back! :) Other times you can hear another vehicle hit you but they don't get the Crown, so I guess it's a fair trade.Cash Boxes land in some very hard to get at places sometimes and I'm sure in a few places that are impossible to get at, but it's fun trying to get them!So, overall I'd have to give it a 10/10, If a driving game can capture the heart of an old RTR fan you know it's gotta be good!

												It's like the poor man's version of something like The Crew and that's not a bad thing!. A mostly open world map where you play on 5 different maps along with other people also playing the game on that same map. You start off with the first and last levels, the latter being a tank versus map. to progress you must perform certain stunts to reach rings to collect them, get a certain amount of points, and win a few events. Events consist of racing, taging ramps and other objects to color them while keeping hold of them by getting big scores off of them, collecting coins, performing stunts and getting the highest score, a sort of tag mode where you must keep the crown away from others or get it yourself and get your timer to zero to win, and a find the ring event where you must look for the ring that you must reach first to win. There are various cars to win and unlock by raising your player level and maxing out your cars' levels, 4 that are unlocked by beating the vehicles in a race on your own (1v1). Each vehicle has four stats: Top Speed- raised by simply staying at the top speed for an extended amount of time, Acceleration- raised by just accelerating, Handling- raised by drifting, and Nitro- raised by using your boost. Once you reach the required player level and amount of cars' stats maxed out, which you can buy out depending on how much progress was made, you use the in game cash to buy the vehicle for use.I highly recommend this game to any racing game fans or anyone just looking for some good clean fun! It's cheap and comes with an extra copy to share with a friend. A game that deserves a look, go ahead buy it!			",538,66,47,53,10,4,15

												Ah, one of the most underrated games out there. Or at least it was way too hard to find this, originally in Google Play.++ Free drive for casuals++ Tank battle for intense play+++ Competitive or not, you're going to enjoy the events, mostly++ Game appears to be well balanced with the stats and special abilities+++ Pay2win is nowhere to be seen+ Controls are good enough, same goes with music and graphics-- Currently, does not possess Steam exclusive content. I bought this for the performance and controls, though.-/+ Eats your time. All of it.-- Might feel a little stale from times to times- Some car ""training"" is annoying, like having to drift more than the game would naturally require for ""cool play""Anyway, this here is a game I want to recommend. Online is nowhere near dead and players play nice and fair.			",24,2,7,0,4,1,8

												ok.... i gotta say i was not expecting this game too be as fun as it is. the keyboard controls are perfect. and it plays on low quality computer like mine really well when you adjust resolution settings.PROS: great key board control, very basic requirements. and just a great time passer.CONS: I noticed when using the 360 controller, you could not do front or backflips, and also sound is a bit strange. your tires squeal even when on sand and grass.Final verdict: 7 outta 10. great game not mindblowing, but for people like myself with crappy computers, you cant go wrong			",12,0,1,0,1,0,0

												Very nice little game.Fling cars off of hills and flip them about to earn points. The multiplayer game modes are mostly ripped straight out of the Tony Hawk games and they work very well. Reminds me of a lot of PS1 games, in a good way. The car physics are very enjoyable and control well just using a keyboard. If you enjoy ramping cars off of hills in an arcadey, low gravity environment you will like this.			",768,128,63,67,65,2,134

												Ever want a barebones driving game you can mess around in, where the lack of polish is its charm? Look no further!ProsThe big one for me: It feels like they bothered playtesting the physics and levels enough to keep it fun.Other bargain-bin driving games often fall apart on me gameplay-wise due to a lack thereof. Simplistic to the point of fun. If you completed the Skyfall tutorial in Blast Corps, you already know how this game handles. The goals differ, though. I find the clunkiness charming. If you're indecisive, the automatic random events that make up the core of this game will take care of that.Cons Reeks of a mobile game designed with P2W in mind. This is toned down enough (at least for now) that fighting the urge to automax will avoid the problems this presents It's been said by other reviewers, but you have to hold down shift during game launch to get to any meaningful options screen. Some events have luck as a large factor. Glitches are mostly minor (eg. getting stuck in walls for a few seconds), but some are major. Got stuck on a server with an integer-overflow delay until the next event.Misc If you use the ""dollar per hour of fun"" metric, this game is worth it (or at least half, but you get an extra copy.) You can fall off the edge. Some like that, some don't. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You can argue this game has too simple mechanics and there is no realismWhat it does have is Stupid fun. Lots of it. With a big S. One quick look at a game play video on youtube tells you all you need to know. After that it's all about skill and trying to not rage when you narrowly loose events. note: There is a lot of players on the servers and you are never racing alone.  ",775,311,45,87,97,7,148

												Crash Drive 2 is a super simplistic and casual stunting game. It looks like something you’d expect to play on the Dreamcast way back in the early noughties but that doesn’t take away from how fun and addictive this game is.7/10Pros/Cons+ The physics engine in the game is decent enough for the quirky and casual game style. + Because the game is online against other players, events create intense fun encounters.+ Would be an excellent game for those young gamers or kids looking to play a casual game.+ The fast paced car unlocking and levelling system in the game adds an addictive play style.- After only 11 hours I had completed the game including achievements; content is lacking.- As previously mentioned the graphics are about a decade behind modern games!- This type of game would be perfect for community made editor levels etc.			",181,22,11,18,20,1,21

												I bought this game on a sale for 1,24€ with a free copy.It's a simple mobile port of an stunt arena game with very basic controls. There are some different Events like Races, Coin-Collecting, King of the Crown....You can also play it with contoller, although there is one downside in the controls, the camera, it's stuck behind your car and you always look where your car is pointing, you can't look around.All in all I'd say it's a good game which you can buy, but I would recommend buying it on a sale, because I think paying 5€ for this would be too much.

												There are some bugs/glitches, but it's a really fun and addicting game.One major thing I noticed is in King of the Crown. The rubberbanding (I believe) is extreme. Other players, like the crown wearer, teleport constantly and just zip and zoom all over the place. It makes that one gamemode impossible to play and enjoy. Still highly recommended.

The open world style works with the progression system, the tank mode can have you coming back for more helpings once you complete everything else, and the free copy to play with a friend is a nice bonus too. Getting the controls to work for you can be a pain, but after that it's all fun.			",344,52,9,12,27,5,37

												Fun game to play randomly, you can play with friends or just on an open server.The game play puts you in a server with other people in an area and you drive around doing whatever you feel like, theres tons of jumps, loops, drifts, cars to run into and other stuff to do. Every few minutes the game will start an event that you can compete in if you want the events range from races to check points to stunt challenges to ccollections and other things.I'm not sure if it can be played offline or not, sometimes it seemed like there was PC cars but then there would be cars with random names that could only be people.Tons of cars to choose from that can be upgraded, tons of maps with plenty to do.Overall it's a solid game my only real issue is when playing with a controller some stunts can't be done for whatever reason, stuff like flips, but they can be done on a keyboard7/10 Great for the price , I got it for $1.24, and it comes with a second copy to give a friend.

												Ladies & Genitals! Some company I've never heard of before presents: Tomy Hicks: Pro DUI 2HOLD SHIFT WHEN LAUNCHING THE GAME FOR VIDEO SETTINGSNow that I've finally managed to 100% the game I might as well write a review.This is a game with one goal: fun.There are some competitive moments when it comes to events but it's not even frustrating when people pull a fast one on you. This game is like the classic Tony Hawk games but with cars, and it's great. At first, 4 maps doesn't sounds like a lot, but once you get into it. It's more than enough. There's also a seperate mode called Tank Battle or something where you try to shoot eachother off the map and rank up, also fun.There are of course a few cons and things that could be improved upon such as no way to talk to other players besides crashing into them multiple times or honking your horn. (which the game is multi-platform so I don't even know if they could implement that) REGARDLESS, there's almost no need to speak to other players because nothing is more satisfying than stealing a cash crate right before they get it.I'd give this game a 9/10 literally. I don't see many games now-a-days that are 100% fun.My advice: buy this game. It's a steal at $5 and you even get a free copy for a friend so that's incredibly nice. -----------------Suggestion for devs: Try adding minimaps you can toggle. When I was first learning the maps I kept getting disoriented with all the hills.			",185,29,3,16,8,0,6

YouTube™ Video: Crash Drive 2 Review / Crashing, Spinning, Driving... CAR MAYHEM! 

			Views: 4,209		

			Crash Drive 2 is a port of a mobile game to Steam and it's got a lot of ridiculous driving, crashing, spinning, and flipping. But is it worth your time?		

Crash Drive 2 is a port of a mobile game to Steam and it's got a lot of ridiculous driving, crashing, spinning, and flipping.  But is it worth your time?  Let's find out in this review on Crash Drive 2.Crash Drive 2 is a pretty simple game.  You pick your car, get out on a multiplayer course with other drivers, and complete objective based events.  The different events include setting a high score, tagging various objects, and being the first to reach a certain ring.  The game is pure mayhem and silly fun as you bump into other players and there's no consequence.  Cars take no damage and most of the time you will land on your wheels.  Even if you don't land upright, chances are you'll easily flip over.  There are five different levels and you must complete a few tasks in order to advance.  You'll have to set a high score, drive through all of the rings one time, and complete a number of events to unlock the next level.  So multiplayer is crucial and it's the point of the game.  Whenever you join a level you're instantly matchmade with other players so you never know who you'll end up with.  Am I really playing with PewDiePie? Probably not, but that's funny.There's also a ton of different cars to unlock.  There's lightweight and fast sports cars, then there are big monster trucks and fire trucks.  The trucks are fun for crashing into your opponents, but the sports cars will let you get tons of air.  Oh Yeah!There's also a crazy tank battle mode that you get to unlock later.  The tanks can shoot and you can blow your opponents away.  Tank battle mode is probably the craziest because you are on a floating platform and you get points by knocking other people off.  It's total mayhem. Tank battle mode is like a different game, but it's also fun to play.The graphics are probably the weakest part of the game.  Since it's a mobile port, it doesn't take advantage of PC power and there are no advanced graphics settings.  Some of the texture are pretty bad, especially in the first level.  The barriers that surround the level are just like warped end points.  They could have done a better job with this.  The plus side is that it does run very well, I maxed out at 144 frames per second and didn't really experience any lag.There were also a few bugs, I got stuck on a tree once or twice but I was able to reset my position by hitting start even though the game doesn't indicate this.  I also had some disconnects during multiplayer sessions.Crash Drive 2 is only $5 on Steam so it may be fun to mess around and drive like a maniac for a bit.  If you like silly games and want to relax from a grueling shooter session, Crash Drive 2 can be a fun distraction.

												Excellent, and I mean excellent game for awhile especially for $5.00. The amount of time played is how long it took me to complete the game in full and for the cost of the game it is definitely worth it and the tank battles were a great addition to this game. It does get repetitious after awhile and I was kind of getting bored of it by the last 5 cars I had to unlock and maybe even a little bit earlier but the tank battles when unlocked was such a refresher and got me back into the game when I actually played it. Good game, would give it a 7.5/10			",96,30,3,5,6,3,7

												So. When I got this game, I didn't really know what to expect; all I know is that it came with a free copy which I immediately unloaded onto my friend who told me ""This game is lame"" and so I shrugged and said to myself the next day ""how lame can it be?"" . .. NOT AT ALL :O Idk why but this game is like the funnest thing ever, you can race people IN A TANK! All the cars are kick♥♥♥♥♥and fun to drive/play as and the maps are fun and littered with nice little challenges and whatnot here and there. Did I mention almost everything is a ramp?! You can launch yourself like DAM SON WHERE'D YOU FIND THESE?! off of everything and do flips and♥♥♥♥♥♥ There are also 6 different public events that happen all the time through out the map and you can either participate or just keep zippin and zoomin about, it's up to you~!Good:+Good time killer. +Great mood booster.+Fun alone or with friends, it doesn't matter.+Kick♥♥♥♥♥Vroom vroom noises+relaxing+Controller support+Price! When it goes on sale, BOY DOES IT GO ON SALE so keep an eye out and get it while it's hot so you can drop it like it is!!Bad:-Graphics(?) they could be better, but this is also a phone game TAKE IT ON THE GO GO AND VROOM VROOM 24/7! so graphics I couldn't care less about-Failure is an option, no one likes loosing and so sometimes when the goal is THERE but you're NOT THERE it kinda sucks, but then go vroom elsewhere and have a fun time bruh, so really there aren't negatives about this game so get it. like. it's fun.

												TL;DR? Basically the game is a terrible version of Tony Hawk games, and it's a sad attempt of a clone.Okay, I looked back at my original review, and I made it around 10 minutes in. Now ive spent around 3 hours into the game, mostly for getting the cards. But, oh boy, has it not been worth it. Let me go over one of the most dissapointing part of the game.First of all, it's a mobile game. Not saying thats bad, but the part that irritates me is that I found this game, for FREE, on Kongregate. Why would you pay 5 dollars for a download of a free Unity game?Second. Ive been having plans to become a game designer for quite a long time by now. I have studied quite a few games, to learn what makes them good. But, the first step for me in my books is broken by this game, and laughs about it. Invisible walls. THERE IS AN ACHIEVEMENT FOR FALLING OFF THE WORLD. Who in their right mind would think that instead of programming invisible walls to the side of your level, you should instead reward the player for falling off the world? That's terrible for the devs! That makes them look lazy! I really just need someone to explain why they did that.Third. It's basically just a watered down Tony Hawk game, alike to the new Pro Skater 5, without the glitches. The biggest problem for me is how to get points and XP. Sounds easy to make, right? They managed to make it extremely flawed. Yeah, it all looks good to kids, the target demographic here, but they can be exploited very easilly. For points? The tag game is the easiest thing in the game. To get a bunch of points, all you need to do is go off a ramp and hold down and left/right. Noone really realizes it, so I keep getting number 1 on each tag mission. Its very sad. Now, the XP system is a good idea how its pitched, but the fact that you can just drift and hold control to boost, and you rack up XP super fast, is just depressing. I really dont understand why it's that easy to abuse.In total, NEVER buy this game. It's a mess of a game, and it's really not fun. I never really wana touch this game again. If you want to try it anyways, go search it up on Kongregate. And if you want an actual fun version, just play Tony Hawk's Underground 2, or even better, a mod for it called THUG Pro. It's super fun.I let my friend watch me play the game for under 15 minutes. She is a huge fan of Tony Hawk games. This is some highlights of what she had to say.Cyoot Shark: ill let you look at the title screen for first impressionssadiewinters: >obnoxious title musicsadiewinters: >in game ads sponsoring the same gamesadiewinters: eghsadiewinters: wait a second are you telling me there's no challenge in drifting whatsoeversadiewinters: i am ashamed of this gamesadiewinters: its like someone took the concept of tony hawk with all the tricks and stuff and heavily nerfed itsadiewinters: #you should've totally failed that trick but you didn't AND THAT ONE TOO WHAT EVENsadiewinters: i cant handle that garbage anymoresadiewinters: no effort trick simulator now with carsCyoot Shark: final thoughts?Cyoot Shark: also reminder the game is free but on steam its 5 dollarssadiewinters: i never want to see that game again as long as i liveLet's listen to her.

												You know when Keanu Reeves always says ""whoa""? I think he must have been looking at an early copy of this game.I had no idea what to expect when I threw this in my cart just to raise my order level a couple of bucks. I love racing games; and the description sounded good. The idea of it being multi-player with random events almost turned me off; mostly because I think online multi-player does nothing but bring up the worst possible players in games...not to mention I wasn't worried about doing anything but driving cars.Well, let me just say my mind was changed as soon as I started playing the game. The levels are in fact open, just not quite as large as you might be made to think. Still, there are tons of physics and gravity defying stuff you can do. Sure, events pop up randomly and you're automatically put in competition...but you're not forced to actually do anything. You can keep driving around doing your own thing, completely ignoring the fact there's an event going on. But the events are somewhat fun and sometimes trying to complete and win those involves a lot of driving around. You aren't forced to join actual races though; just events that continue to work in sandbox mode.There are a lot of various cars, and you do have to level them up. You have the option of buying a max level; but I wouldn't do it. Leveling the cars up to max doesn't take very long; I was able to level several cars to max in less than the 3 hours I first played; for the most part driving the car around will help you boost it's four areas. Drifting maxes your handling ability, using nitro obviously boosts your nitro ability, actual acceleration increases your acceleration rating, and driving at top speed maxes out your top-speed rating. Just driving around doing drifts for 20 or 30 minutes in a car will get it's level quite high. Save your money for buying cars as you unlock them.I still can't get over how addictively fun this game is. The controls of the car are quite simple...and in a way remind me of a lot of the other simple racers. You don't have 4000 controls you need to memorize to drive the thing, just a few basic commands and a lot of fun arcade-type handling. There seems to be plenty of stuff to do; although if the events aren't your deal...the levels may get boring after a while. Still, for even the non-sale price; it's worth picking up a copy. I love it.  I just bought Stranded Deep and thought I was going to be playing that for the next 6 months; but this one might give it a run for it's money.You should be warned though; you appear to be playing with users of the mobile version as well; which has several hacks and cheats available for it; so I highly suspect some users aren't playing honestly.

												A fun, simple game which can be picked up easily (when bored) and played for a good amount, considering it's a mobile port. Multiplayer works well, some cars are jittery though. Controlling the cars feels nice (although tanks doing frontflips and going 80mph isn't very realistic).I am writing reviews at 6am because I am bored.			",50,8,0,3,7,0,2

Just goofy old race car game mechanics, reminds me of the stunt track on the first San Fransisco Rush game. A fair amount of people playing. Has mini games that everyone on the map spawns into. There is a tank level where everyone has tanks!Seriously, for buying a copy for my brother and I at a two dollar and fifty cent game this was totally worth it.			",244,13,6,10,20,1,16

												Crash Drive 2 is a disappointing multiplayer game, with repetitive and uninteresting gameplay that is driven entirely by a hollow unlockable/level-up system that sets it down a tragic path that diverges from the fundamental gameplay aspects of it's predecessor, Crash Drive 1.     The gameplay is only half decent, and it relies entirely on levelling up and unlocking new vehicles. Each vehicle is only unique in appearance, since after maxing their levels (which is very easy) they all have virtually the exact same stats. This results in the player having to unlock many, many cars that he/she truly doesn't like or care about until they eventually unlock their favorite car--or maybe even unlock them all--at which point he/she has no reason to ever play with the other cars or really even play the game ever again. This is especially frustrating because the first installment of Crash Drive had totally unique cars with very different stats, and I found myself frequently switching between cars simply for fun. In Crash Drive 2, however, switching between cars is merely a chore that is necessary to continue the unlocking process.      I also found the multiplayer only state of the game to be tedious, since my favorite part of the first Crash Drive game was the solitude of it, doing insane tricks like a child in a sandbox all by yourself without being bothered by anybody. It was peaceful and relaxing, whereas Crash Drive 2's multiplayer focus is almost annoying. Suddenly, the game is all about competition, which ruins what I always thought was the most fundamental part of Crash Drive: the casual gameplay.I respect Crash Drive 2 for it's ambition, for trying to become something bigger and better, but I don't think the game achieves what it attempts to.     The only saving grace of this game is Tank Battles, which is actually pretty fun and unique. I found it very entertaining for a bit, but it gets boring after not to long. I can't imagine I'll ever return to this game--not for tank battles, and especially not for the main game. After putting this game down, all I can say is that the whole game felt like a job: it kept me playing with the stupid unlockable system, but it never truly entertained me like the first game did. Crash Drive 2 was nothing but a waste of time to me. I disliked the game so much that I can't even imagine giving my free gift copy to a friend, lest I subject them to an equally negative experience.Overall Rating = 3.3/10 I want my time back			",55,11,1,4,13,0,0

												I really like this game. Its a multiplayer throwback to the stunt half of ""Hot Wheels Velocity X"" What prevents it from getting onto that level of greatness revolves around the disspointing Tank mini-game, offline options, broken ""join friend"" system and a couple of missing features that every multiplayer game should be having. Its really depressing because I had fun with the general gameplay of Crash Drive 2, but that's because its Hot Wheels Velocity X without the guns and variety of modes...still a pretty good game for just $3.99, but will you enjoy it as much as I have with the previously listed issues? That is where Steam Refunds comes in if you cannot overlook its short comings...AND THE BROKEN JOIN FRIEND OPTION. CMON GUYS! D:

												Could be a very fun game, but I have a couple of issues. First and foremost - definitely not PC/Laptop friendly. Perhaps the devs could have played a couple of (PC) driving games before they invented their own unique control scheme - which doesn't match any driving game I've seen.  Failing that, perhaps they could have arranged for control settings to be SAVED FOR THE NEXT SESSION. It's annoying enough to have to reconfigure the controls, worse when you have to do it every time you want to play. Makes me really not want to. Would also be nice if there was a 'look around' functionality not tied to your steering. Again, this is pretty much a given with a PC driving game.			",39,5,1,3,59,0,53

												I don't recommend this game, but not for the reasons you might think. You know what this game reminds me of? Monster Truck 4x4: World Circuit for the Wii. Not bad or terrible, but definitely nothing amazing. You've seen pretty much all the game has to offer after 30 mins or so of playing. While the question of whether or not this game is worth your time is totally subjective, I would recommend you not buy it even with the ""Buy 1 get 1 free"" deal going on atm. Why? Because this game is FREE on Apple and Android and you can play it for free through your browser as long as you have the Unity plugin installed (also free). You think you're getting a deal, but in reality, you aren't. If you have a younger kid who likes racing games, direct him to a website he can play this on. If you're looking for some indepth racing experience or good arcade racing fun, there are better options ON STEAM. Just remember, this game is free elewhere...			",109,11,5,5,9,2,20

												Don't get me wrong, this game is actually very good. But because of certain attributes about this game, I just cannot recommend this. The game starts off with you getting your first car. There are four different worlds, and a tank battle arena that is separate. The object is to level up and get better cars and unlock new worlds. Now mind you, these ""worlds"" are just moderately sized maps. You have to do stunts through all the rings and win a certain number of events before the next world is unlocked. This game is completely open world, even while there is an event going on. So participating in any of these events is completely optional. But as you level up, you'll notice that none of the later vehicles are really faster than the previous ones, sometimes actually being worse. The handling mechanics are also slightly sketchy, but that is not really a problem. The graphics are a bit outdated, making things like grass and water look bad. I believe the game is on the unity engine, and it shows when you fall out of the level or your suspension pokes through your tire. This game is also normally $5, overpriced given that this game is completely free on mobile devices.Pros:-open world-ok multiplayer-good leveling system-good game layout and concept-good controls, can be customizedCons:-bad textures-weird vehicles forms like the tires floating underneath your car-free on mobile-none of the vehicles are different from each other-no vehicle customization-slightly weird driving mechanics, no big deal			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Pros:If you like cartoony racing games buy this one. It has very smooth controls and is easy for even young kids to be competitive due to the ability to manuever vehicle in air (which also allows for tricks which is a fun part of the game). The graphics and models all fit the theme and even though they and the particle effects are store bought ""packs"" you don't mind because the maps are well crafted and the vehicles are very pleasing to look at.Each vehicle handles differently and each is fun to play but none seem to be over powered and even the lower vehicles easily compete with the higher level. Unlike most racing theme games where the lobby sits empty due to poor multiplayer session design; Crash Drive 2 allows players to drive around in a open world map levelling, gaing cash, and stunt driving until the racing, collecting, stunting, etc matches begin. This keep players in the servers between ""matches"" and helps with the empty sever problem of other games. You can also join servers where your friends are at using the box on the Play screen!Don't be put off about the poor reviews of input controls, the game uses the arrow keys for driving and ctl and space for nitros and brake.. drop the mouse (it does nothing in game) and use your right hand on the arrow keys and left for nitros/brake.. it is very intuitive and feels quite natural and arcade like.    The cash gathering, vehicle levelling, player levelling, and map levelling all make for a good balance of stuff to do that keeps you occupied between events and the progression seems about right imho.There is no chat so you can safely let your kids play without worry about filters, you will also have a more pleasant time not getting into trash talking matches (which could also be a con...)Now for the CONS:Cheating happens in this type of game. In about 1 out of 5 play sessions you will run into a cheater who uses some hack to beat an event. In the Capture the Crown event there is a hack that allows the crown wearer to instantly end the event and win or using map glitches to hide under ground. In the Stunt Point event and Stunt Tag event several map hacks allow for assinine scores at times. I have never been affected by cheating in the racing events, Ring Grab,  or Coin collection events that I noticed. However, except in the case of the hacks that prematurely end the event you can usually  get a coin earning place since there is usually only one player cheating and sometimes their hack kicks them and you get first if you didn't give up. The free flowing point/cash earning design of the game keeps these POS hackers from ruining the game but they are aggravating and need to be addressed. You can also simply quit and rejoin and get a new server away from the hacker. But like most hackers.. most of them bore easily and few stay long.There are some menu problems, you have to QUIT the garage to change maps/servers join friends server... this feels very counter intuitive to pretty much all other racing games where you go to the map FROM the garage!Your mouse cursor will occassionally disappear for no reason in menus and you will have to swing mouse around till you get lucky and get over button... sometimes you can hit escape to back to prior menu where cursor exists.Final thought: Buy it, get your free gift game, and get playing!

												A few of you might know Crash Drive 2 is originally a mobile game. Yes, but before you say ""Lyra, this has nothing to do with a review of such a game!!!"", yes it does. And why you ask?This PC port of this Massively Multiplayer Online racing game is another good example of a game that's much better on PC than on mobile.Suuuuuuuuuure, the mobile game is free, and I played it myself too. Just because its free doesnt mean it's a mobile game with good framerate and easy to play on the touch screen. And it does not mean there's no ads.Y'see, this PC version is extrememly fast and much easier to play. And its very compatible too. I recently played this game on a very old 2006 Windows XP computer. Here's the specs: 1GB Ram, (idk about the processor but its an old one I tell ya), NVIDIA GeForce 7300LE. For today's standards, this is a not-very-powerful-little-PC-thats-almost-10-years-old.   And guess what? My computer ran the game in 100% FPS. No lag or crap like that, on a computer that's almost 10 years old!!! On my phone, which is.... let me see... I know its taking me a while... just you wait... stupid phone... wait... oops wrong menu,,, dang it... here... ""About Phone""... hmmm.... 2011. Thats right. I tried the game on my 2011 Phone, and there was lots of lag. Very annoying.... but my old PC which is less powerful than my phone, can run it better!!! That being said, the gameplay on the PC will be much more enjoyable.And when I mean ""much more enjoyable"", that's saying a lot, so listen! First, there's that great frame rate, I dont think I need to talk more about it. Then, there's the graphics; they're obviously better, and obvously this has nothing to do with how much you enjoy the gameplay. But seriously, the game is much easier to control because its not a touch screen where you have to worry about having big, massive and giantic fingers. Y'just use the arrows keys! And it controls the cars perfectly with not any problem. If you plug a controller, the game will automatically recognize your controller and make the game playable with it. The game plays EXTREMEMLY well with a controller, and I strongly recommend you, as much as I recommend to not play the mobile game that is 7.8 too much lag, that you use a controller. There's a thing I would like to say about the controller mode though. It does play excellent, but there is a more or less big problem. It doesnt ruin the gameplay, but it makes it slightly less fun, but dont you worry, it's an issue they'll fix in no doubt: In mid-air with a controller, you can only steer your car to the left and right. I cant steer the car fowards or backwards so that I can make a flip. This issue MUST be fixed as soon as possible. If the gas button on the controller wont steer the car in mid-air (up arrow is the gas on the keyboard, and it also steers the car fowards in mid-air), then you can program it so that if I push the analog stick up and down it'll make me steer fowards and backwards in mid-air.The in-game events are very addictive. As addictive as buying games on Steam: You dont wanna stop doing it. There is an event in which you have to collect more coins than your opponents (which are real people, remember its a MMO), another where someone has a crown and you must steal it from the current person who has it, and you gotta have the crown on you for 60 seconds.... there's a checkpoint-based (what? That's how we say it, no?) race game, a stunt contest in which you must do more points than your opponents by doing stunt, and a couple of more events. These event are, surprisingly, very competitive, believe it or not. This makes the game much more fun to play for long periods of time. Altough, you shoudln't play for so long without breaks.There are LOTS of cars to unlock and to upgrade. You upgrade the car by simply playing (Not kidding!), or you pay to upgrade it at maximum. You expect me to say more? I dont have anything else to say, its just that great.The maps are well made and very large. And you wont get bored in them, as there is lots of things to do in them. Loops, jumps, objects, rings, ramps....anything you want! I do think a level editor would be an AMAZING idea.The sound is good, nothing much to say about it.The physics arent very realistic. But, hey, who the heck cares for physics in a racing game like that? The physics are fun and well made, and that's what counts really. Realistic physics in this game would be a disaster, trust me.To conclude, you shut up and you give them your money. Its that much worth it. Happy gaming!			",445,57,47,23,36,6,23

												Crash Drive 2 is a nice clean online car game. This is one of the best mobile ports I've ever played on the PC and it's certainly cool playing against people on Mac Books and iPhones. The controls on the PC using a wireless Xbox 360 controller are tight and responsive in game but you'll need your mouse and keyboard to navigate the menus. My only complaint is that there's only 4 maps to unlock along with a ""Tank Battle"" set of maps. I won't go into the games descriptions because you can probably go in YouTube and Google and get a better understanding of it than I could write. But if you're looking for a cheap, casual game that all ages can enjoy this is it.			",210,58,11,66,26,2,49

												I love this game. It' so fun to play with my 3 year old son. It's an open world racing game with tons of stunts and speed, no violence and online play without chat, so it's perfect for kids. They have some issues with controls that need to be sorted out; Specifically, there should be a way to unbind keyboard and gamepad controls by deleting them instead of replacing them. That's a small criticism to a really solid game.UPDATE: The game is unplayable with a controller because the input issues.			",10,4,0,0,2,0,0

												Another on-line game ruined by griefers. Every time I attempted group play, I was battered around by players using cheats to get tanks. Rather than just compete and cheat to win, these dimwits just run around smashing into others, ruining whatever they are attempting to do. I attempted to play SP but was again chased and rammed repeatedly by what I thought was supposed to be a bot driver.Need space on HD for games I can enjoy playing. Bye Bye Crash Drive 2.

												This game hugely disappointed me. You see, PC games have higher standards than app store games. This is definitely app store worthy. I can't believe I wasted $5 in steam wallet money on this. There are NO ACTUAL RACES unless u wait an hour to finaly get in a mini game race that is chosen at random. Make sure to watch gameplay of every game before buying it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I like this game I really do. And I really want to thumbs up it but it has so many fun modes but they are all killed by the bland stunt system.  All you seem to be able to do when coming off a ramp is spin in a circle. Forget corkscrewing stuff like that it does not happen and for some reason unless its a physical object impact that causes you to do so you cannot even front flip. Its almost like the stunt names exist but the method of execution is not.Whats more is even the race falls into blandness. On the first map does not even use at all the awesome ramps it avoids every single bit of prop there is and makes you drive essentially in a dirt flat circle. Devs why not use that giant ramp or even some of those loopy loops as checkpoints? You must have worked hard to design that stuff and yet its wasted.			",626,116,22,83,64,5,126

												This game is sort of like other MMOs on the internet, the only difference is its on steam. The last game (crash drive 3D) was horrible, but i was happy they made a 2nd game. the 2nd game has 30 cars in total, for you to stunt, crash and shoot (yep there is a tank in this game), the game is very easy but however there needs to be more bugs to be fixed, over all it is a good game.

												Overall - 3.5/5 - A GOOD BARGAINI recommend CD2 to Steam gamers who enjoy a good racer - at $5.49 the game provides a lot of online multiplayer action and a significant amount of replay value at a fair price. Combine this with the fact that purchase includes a giftable copy of the game to give to a friend, and multiplayer capability spans platforms, and CD2 is one of the better deals on Steam right now - if you're a fan of casual, fast-paced, online racing pick this title up.Read the full review of this title and more at Budget Gaming Review!http://budgetgaming.blogspot.ca/2015/06/crash-drive-2.html ",21,3,0,5,0,0,0

												This is the best game, actually, scratch that, best ANYTHING, mankind has achieved. Im so glad to have been born in the same era as this was released.Pros:-Acheivment for falling out of the map the developer didn't even try to hide (probobly to get more hi-rez pizels on screen)-Utter chore to unlock cars near the end (such is life, amiright?)-Me and my friend obtained the IP's of everyone on the server we were on in under 10 mins (not everything's perfect)-The fact that this is actually a free browser game (mans gotta eat, you know)-Minigame variations (being seriuos on this one, this is the only good thing I can say)Cons:-noneMajor security flaws, 10/10 ",83,6,1,3,12,0,6

												Thanks for the Linux support!Note this is a mobile cross-platform game. The game is free with transactions in the Play Store, paid once for pretty much everything here - a very good way to handle multi platform games in my opinion.Optimisation isn't great, had trouble playing it on my tablet; the Surface Pro 3 and my friend had trouble on her MacBook Pro with low end discreet graphics.Playing with friends can be fun, cross platform works, but unlocking all the courses to play together can be tiresome.

												I got this game during the Lunar New Year sales as it seemed like a fun, random stress reliever versus all the other games I played and man, was I right. It's mindless fun with awesome yet simple goals that keeps the game intense and challenging while never losing its fun nature. Very awesome game and the fact that it comes with a free copy to gift to a friend really makes this game an awesome time to play!			",60,30,2,5,5,0,4

												While the graphics aren't great and the camera viewpoint leaves something to be desired at times the pace of the game is great. Dashing around the countryside in a wild variety of cars while doing stunts and attempting to win events against other players as they come by is quite relaxing.			",99,41,2,5,22,3,5

												If you're into some casual arcade stunt driving, this is the game for you. At least I had a lot of fun with it.however sometimes I encountered this problem that when standing in front of an obstacle, you can't move anymore - reverse doesn't always work. but apart from that, good fun.

												Introduction:Although this game is a mobile port (which has cross platform support with mobile) that doesn't mean it's bad. Most mobile ports are absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥on steam but this one is decent. Now there is a reason it comes with a free copy is because it's overall more enjoyable with a friend because this game lacks content. Price: Let's be clear, this game is not worth the full price so don't go buying this full price grab it when it's on sale. I got this on sale of course and this game is worth around a dollar. Even though I say it lacks content I spent over 5 hours unlocking stuff which despite keeping me busy it didn't have the variety that would come with a higher price.What it's about:It's a game where you go around stunting with cars collecting points for flips, spins, and hitting beacons above the jump points. There are several stats to each car you unlock which are bought using ingame currency earned by winning random events and doing stunt jumps (beacons). You can level the stats to the cars by driving certain ways (explained later).  There is also a tank pvp gamemode which has hilarious impact physics which literatly send someone either flying in a random direction or simply flip them a bit. Stats: You have several stats on each car. Top speed which is leveled by driving fast, Acceleration which is leveled by accelerating from a near stop, handling which is leveled by drifting, and boost which is leveled by using your boost. Most of these stats work well except when you're trying to level out all the cars at the end because acceleration can be quite annoying where all the other stats can be easily level grinded by drifting fast across ice.   Bugs and Functionality:This game may play better on controller which I haven't tested. The annoying bug that you get use to is where you have to go to the esc menu to view you mouse which makes the onscreen garage button almost useless because it's hard to click without a mouse (although it's also in the esc menu). This is likely something left in from the mobile version for who knows what reason (touch screens maybe?). There is also a bug where if you're on a different map then you friend and you try to join them using the steam friends list it will put you in the game but you'll be on the map you were on and not your friend's map where you'll see the cars driving around usually floating because of different map terrain and so on. This game lacks graphics options which isn't much of an issue with this game. Why you might ask? This is because of it's mobile style and cross platform play. The game defaults to native resolution (you monitor resolution) so if that's an issue then avoid this game but overall it's not an issue. The game runs at 60 frames+ thankfully, and graphics are simple and would be pointless to change since requirements are low anyways due to it sharing online play and style with mobile.Conclusion: Buy at sale price and use that gift copy to play with a friend and you'll use that sale price beyond it's value.

												I found this game to be a lot of fun.  Simple and engaging.  There seems to be automatic skill balancing in the multiplayer if you are not playing with friends, or it's just random and luck on my part!There are races as one of the mini-activities, but overall you can do what you want and just have fun.  The points don't matter! Pro's:Easy to jump intoLots of fun carsNO text or voice chat.  This may seem like a con, but keep in mind this is a driving sim where everyone drives completely recklessly.  You don't want to hear what they are saying. These aren't the droids you're looking for. Fast-pace activities, always something to do.Can completely ignore the activities if you want to!Cons:All cars seems to drive alike, with minor tweeks (This one goes faster then that one, etc.)  Including the Tank!!Goofy physics, but this might be a pro since doing just about any of these tricks would result in a fatality. Since it's server-multiplayer only, long-term support is questionable.LOTS of cheaters online.  Which confuses the heck out of me... WHY would anyone want to cheat at this game?  There's no logic to it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
