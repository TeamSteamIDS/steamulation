												Pros:- Removed the annoying young driver test, has been replaced by a 1 lap race to determine your difficulty, or you can skip it entirely and set the difficulty yourself! Really like this feature personally- New cars, liveries, tracks, generally looks more streamlined and visually appealing- Handling/braking feel better and more realistic than previous versions (to me anyway)- Cheaper price than previous versions at launchCons:- New game coming out early in 2015 so unless you're a diehard fan of F1, probably wait until then- Small steps and improvements from previous versions, nothing gamechanging- Would've been nice to see scenario mode and/or season challenge extended in some way so they're not something you just play through once and forget aboutIt's a solid game, my initial impressions are it's pretty good and worth buying if you like the F1 series. If you're just a casual gamer and occasionally play racing games then I'd probably wait until the next one comes out.			",71,9,47,9,23,1,17

F1 2014Return to the Turbo EraEssentially a reskin of 2013 running on exactly the same engine. However that does not make it a bad game or even a rushed game. The game handles totally diffrent from 2013 as you would expect with the sport moving from N/A V8's to Turbo V6's.You can brake much later in 2014 than in 2013 and you have to really manage your throttle out of corners. Due to being turbo charged now the cars produce massive tourque which can easily light up the rear tyres out of corners.A minor polish to graphics and weather, updated teams and drivers, the AI again is better year on year (Mistakes are made etc) the tyre model is also a lot better than 2013.Freerider-Dave ",127,29,30,7,28,0,22

												As you would guess. This game is basically F1 2013.5However Codemasters are the only company in the world who could copy and paste a game and still make it worse.Sidepod glitches are worse in my opinion while Autospin curbs still exist and the online is more unstable than ever!For the record. The game is still quite fun and challenging to drive on the wheel, however pads have InBuilt traction control which gives them zero wheelspin and better tyre wear. In wet conditions the gap between the wheel and pad can be as large as 3 seconds, which is simply crazy. This is making league racing almost impossible, which is the only reason i play the game.Codies have had 5 years to improve, the game however has made no significant improvments, While luke spring, Steve hood continue to ignore all of the community and continue to make broken games!F1 2015 will be on a new engine (So they say...) So this for me is the game that will make or break codemasters f1 games. The chances of a improved game are slim, but we can only hope!			",54,6,10,7,10,1,8

												F1 2014 is the successor of F1 2013 and when Codemasters announced this game, they mentioned that there won't be any major changes in it. The reason for the lack of new features in the game is simply that Codemasters is focusing on the New-Gen F1 2015 game completely, to make it even better than the current games. They will also use and develop a completely new engine for F1 2015, which is taking time and that's probably why they didn't change much from F1 2013 to F1 2014, yet there are minor changes which have a big influence on the Gameplay.First off, you will notice that the Young Drivers' Test is no longer in the game, but has been replaced by the Evaluation-Test, which is automatically adjusting the AI-Level to your personal skill-level. The Young Drivers' Test helped to understand the basics and kind of guided you through the game. Now with the new Evaluation-Test you are thrown into a lap of Monza without any explanations at all. I recommend retaking the test several times to get used to the handling etc.Also, you can now pick whatever Team you want to pick in Career mode and you therefore don't have to wait for a contract offer.Now we're coming to the gameplay-changing part of F1 2014. First, there is this in my opinion annoying sound of the new V6 engines, which is awful but unfortunately realistic, so it isn't Codemasters fault. Also there are 8 gears instead of the 7 gears of the F1 2013 Season and you can't adjust the gear ratios anymore. The design of the cars is good, but unluckily the Williams Design was changed a bit, because Codemasters had licensing-issues with Martini but there are mods already which allow you to use the original design of Williams.The handling has also changed in F1 2014. You can actually feel that there is less mechanical grip. In addition to that, the car also has a more unstable rear end now, causing more oversteer and this is making driving without assists even tougher than it was back in F1 2013.Now we're coming to the AI:The AI (atleast on Legend) is now more aggressive than it was in 2013, which is providing a bigger challenge for Players. Also, the overtakes of the AI in corners got improved, so if they overtake on the outside, they actually stay on track rather than leave the track and lose 4 Positions like in 2013. Yet still, if they overtake on the inside, they still back off and don't even try to go for a gap. All in all, the game has made minor improvements, but does not feature any major changes to F1 2013. For me, as a League and Multiplayer-Racer, it is crucial to get this game, as it is a very long period of time until F1 2015 will be released. I recommend buying the game if you are a F1-Fan even if you already played F1 2013, because F1 2014 features the new Season, new cars, new handling etc.			",32,0,8,1,1,0,4

												First off, let me open by disagreeing with most people's statements of ""it's just 2013 but with new engine sounds/team rosters/tracks"" while yes, on the surface, it seems that way, however, when you dig a little deeper, it's oh so much more.for this review, I'll begin with Pros/Cons, then go through each of the main focuses of negative comments about the game.Pros:-New Turbo engine sounds are awesome (in my opinion)-The handling rework has made the game so much more about skill now. 2013 required a lot of skill to drive, but 2014 makes you re-learn all the tracks with added braking zones due to the new car physics.-The AI is now extremely competitive, and will give you an even greater challenge while racing.-Young Driver Test: out, single lap of Monza with the option to skip: in. Frankly, I found the test to be both rewarding and infuriating in 2013. most challenges in it were fairly simple and easy, however, when it came to getting that one silver medal converted into gold to unlock all the teams at the start of career, it got rather frustrating when it got to a point where I simply couldn't squeeze any more time out of the lap. This game, however, has you driving a single lap around the Italian GP circuit of Monza which you can even skip and select the game difficulty yourself.-Career mode now has the option of Short/Medium/Long career featuring 7/12/19 races respectively. So if you want to race an F1 career, but don't have the patience for the entire calendar, then you can miss 7 or 12 races out if you like.Cons:-Codemasters is very limited (much in the same way as EA is with Fifa) that they are contractually obliged to release a new F1 game every season, no matter how much/little has changed, which explains why 2013 and 2014 are extremely similar.-Some would've liked to see a new UI (I'm fine with re-using the old one, I'd rather not have to re-learn where everything is in menus as well as having to re-learn how to drive properly)-Mercedes is stupidly OP compared to all other teams.-Still no formation lap prior to the race and no podium scenes-No F1 Classics this seasonNow the Pros and Cons are out of the way, time for some issue addressing.-""It's Exactly the same as F1 2013""Wrong. it isn't. Why don't you go ahead and do a lap of Monza on F1 2013, then play 2014 and try driving the exact same lines at the exact same speed as the previous game. I guarantee that 100% of the time, you'll massively understeer at the first of the Lesmo turns. The lower downforce on the 2014 cars is really shown in the game, and credit to Codemasters for their execution of how different the handling has been this year. Additionally, as I stated above, Codemasters (or whoever holds the contract) is obliged to make a new game for the franchise EVERY year, no matter how much has changed within the sport, so you can't always expect a game that's drastically different to the previous installment.-""There's no KERS""Wrong again. What F1 2013 fans know as KERS, is now one half of the new ERS (Energy Recovery System) The KERS part is now known as MGU-K which draws energy under braking, and MGU-H draws energy from exhaust heat. While in 2013, the drivers could choose when to deploy their KERS energy, in 2014, from what I can tell, it's all controlled by the onboard ECU chip in the engine, which utilises the additional 33 seconds of increased horsepower as and when it needs to. So before you go moaning about the lack of deployable KERS, try watching an actual race and see if the drivers are even in control of their energy deployment.-""The menus are exactly the same""Yes... they are, but as the saying goes, if it isn't broke, don't fix it.-""The Williams livery isn't right""No, it isn't, this is because Codemasters were unable to secure the rights to use the Williams Martini livery, so they used the alternate livery from races where advertising alcohol is banned.-""What happened to F1 Classics mode?""This was asked on the official forums, and the response was ""Because this year's cars are so drastically different in performance from the old cars, we have chosen not to include classics in F1 2014""This is about all I can think of for now, but if I can think of anything more than just needs to be mentioned, then I'll be sure to edit the review (mainly after I start playing multiplayer more)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am not sure what people's issues are with this. Yes, there are going to be a LOT of similarities to 2013, because as someone else pointed out, F1 is F1!The difference in the car handling/sound etc from 2013 is very realistic. (Those complaining about the assistst, turn them OFF in the options!) (Those saying there are still assists present, where???) (Those complaining about traction control, well...TURN THAT OFF too!)The physics & handling modeling are very good, I was just driving Monaco, started in damp/wet conditions on Inters and could ""feel"" the car improving as the track dried, and this transitioned upon chaning to Options. Oh, and love the random birds flying around, nice touch.I do have a few complaints, mainly realism complaints...Where are the marshalls? Also, the cars seem quite tough, luckily for me haha, and I've failed to avoid someone elses debris a few times and not suffered a puncture, again luckily.There are a number of things I hope have been added to 2015 though, more back game play, ability to ""wander"" round the paddock and have to endure the journalist's questions, ""shaping"" your drivers charecter and how they are viewed publicly, and privately by other drivers, a little more ""politics"" that translates onto the track instead of driving against a bunch of mindless opponents. Surely it can't be that difficult to factor in the drivers' style and approach to their AI counterparts?The racing, so far, they have got pretty bang on...now time to expand the rest of the game :)Edit: I've just seen a marshall! Hanging over the barrier at Monaco :)			",3,0,4,1,5,0,5

												F1 2014 is the latest addition to the Codemasters racing game series. Earlier this year announced Codemasters that they were working on two Formula 1 titles, one for the old consoles and one for the new consoles, and unfortunately this is something you'll quickly notice in F1 2014 for generally there has not been much in compared to the 2013 edition, and it can actually be quite difficult to see why there should be changes if you are not familiar with Formula 1 in advance. When starting the game will no longer greeted by ""young drivers test"" but instead you get a single round at Monza where you then get proposed a severity and assists. One should therefore no longer perform a number of tasks that test a racing driver then you will get some offers from different teams depending on how well you have done. Instead, you can now sign a contract with any team so that means you can sit down in a Mercedes racing and start winning all his races immediately. One need no longer run for the slow teams and gradually earn to be a top running, you will be just. It leaves a slightly empty feeling that you are allowed to drive for a team without actually and have done to deserve it. If you have played games series before, there are no major surprises in the career mode. Once you have selected a team starts the battle to become the team's first drive, here you will be weighed and measured on how to cope in the season according to championship points, qualification and race results. Itself, it is will be the team's first run, which will affect the car's setup and how the further development of it takes place. As soon as career mode begins, the game shows itself from its best side when one starts his first race, it becomes clear that you are not sitting alone in the car, but that you have a whole team behind him that is ready to help someone. One's engineer is often with radio announcements with information about how you're doing in the race and how you can improve yourself. From the start the team's requirements be somewhat reluctant until that has proven its worth, and then they begin to push for delivering results to the team. You will notice that the team's confidence to a slowly being built and it shows by example. may be prompted to save the tires of qualifications because they expect that you could easily go on. It works pretty convincing for it feels namely that the team pay attention to and that they are giving thought to how to cope in the season. In addition to the career mode, the game this year at a reunion with the fantastic scenario game mode, here is everything as usual, you have the ability to run different scenarios that are taken out of the real Formula 1 world. Scenarios opens the possibility for players who do not have time to run a full 100% run of still having to get up to handle fuel, safety car and more. When it comes to gameplay feels the game is somewhat different than in the past, this is due to the new regulations that 2014 season has brought with him. The new hybrid cars have been a bit easier to manage because they have shorter stopping distances which makes it easier to correct the drive error as you do. The old KERS system which saved eletrisk energy which you could then use as a speed boost has been replaced with the new ERS. This means that you no longer even rådder of its electrical energy as the car is available. Unfortunately, featuring F1 2014 no longer on the classics that had been in F1 in 2013, it is shame because it really was a feature that distinguished themselves and who could easily have imagined had been extended to 00s racing cars. It seems odd that you choose to remove such a good feature when the game does not have much new to offer. F1 2014 is an odd game that does not really offer anything new, but you still can not accuse Codemasters to make just a reskin of the 2013 series, for under the hood, there are many changes that appear if you look hard enough, but you get nevertheless a feeling that Codemasters has just released F1 2014 will fill the void until F1 2015 is published as many racing fans are eagerly awaiting. So many places you feel that Codemasters could have done more for the game such. add podiums, running interviews, warm up laps as a fan of the series have long efterspurgt- but perhaps we see in 2015? It is in many ways hard to recommend F1 2014, but if you a fan of Formula 1 is still hard to ignore, because of running rokaderne and the new regulations as Codemasters has implemented furnished.Thanks to Alexander Mortensen from Pixel-TV			",293,83,80,28,41,7,38

												hmm.. well there isnt much to report. It is exactly the same as 2013.. Literally nothing different except engine sound, 8 gears, and less traction to similate the new 2014 F1 cars... And a couple of new tracks, per the F1 season.Other than that it is F1 2013.. Like, same everything, as if the files were not even touched. Just simply cut and pasted. No graphic updates, no new menu styles or colors, no new voices, just nothing..Got halfway through 1st practice session at season opener Melbourne and turned it off.a waste, unfortunately			",30,1,8,3,2,0,0

												First, I think it is best to start by saying that if you are looking for a good racing sim that covers the F1 2014 season then this is a must have. It gives you the new turbocharged cars, the 2014 track list and the 2014 roster (exempting some mid/late season changes).  There are a lot of reviews that call this a ""copy/paste"" of F1 2013's gameplay. That is correct but only because F1 as a actual sport is not one that changes it's entire rule structure, driver roster or track schedules in massive ways. it's a sport so any evolution is going to be slow and gradual. Going into F1 2014 with the understanding that it gives you exactly what it's title says (a F1 2014 season game) will probably save you from getting super upset.  I mean, seriously. Are people expecting races on the moon or something? Perhaps Jet powered cars with missile launchers? It's a F1 sim/game so it is going to use the material that the actual sport provides.  The only really significant downer is the lack of 2013's classic mode but considering how limited in scope the classic mode is in 2013, I suppose I can understand why they want to wait until they can really do more with that concept and I don't think F1 2014 was the place for them to do that (though I think expectations are high for F1 2015).  So, with that out of the way, lets talk about specifics. 1.) Graphics. This title is not going to be a massive jump from 2013 but it does the job perfectly. The car models look fantastic. The tracks look good and effects still do the job as well as you would want them to. The real standout however is the rain effects. Codemasters seems to understand the importance of good rain effects and how it effects the gameplay. 2.) Sound. The sound is great. The cars sound correct and reflect the 2014 move to 6cyl turbocharged power units. The rest of the effects do the job just fine and give you plenty of situational awareness. 3.) Physics/handling. This is where I think a lot of people have the wrong attiude in their reviews. They get so used to 2013's handling (with more downforce and less torque) that the 2014 cars can come as a surprise since they feel ENTIRELY different. This can make it difficult for those that mastered F1 2013 and some will get frustrated at having to adapt to a new driving style (just like the real drivers had to deal with). The handling is a real high-point in F1 titles and this is no different. 4.) Gameplay modes. It does not have the classic mode which is fine but the rest of the normal options are still there. The only big change is the switch from a long ""young drivers test"" to a short evaluation lap which can either be welcome or unwelcome depending on your skill level going in. Overall. while it lacks the classic cars and tracks of 2013. It still provides a solid F1 2014 season experience that accurately reflects the technical changes in a satisfying way. If you want a sports franchise to change in leaps and bounds then you probably are not being reasonable but I suspect that a lot of the big stuff is being saved for the F1 2015 release.

												Well if you were expecting a brand new game, you didnt read the internet carefully - what you did get, was the final, polished and refreshed version of a tried and true game with current season updates. F1 2014 offers up the current F1 season in all its horrible sounding and looking glory. That said  - The handling - is MASSIVLY improved. Using a wheel (G27) and no assists, you can snap the car around, lock up under breaking and even have that dreaded wheel spin on exits... its all about setting up the wheel you have CORRECTLY (and if you need, using the profiler). I found that setups also now play a key role. Too much or too little spring/wing and the car becomes a nightmare. Thankfully gear ratios are out of the  picture. Cars have ""difficulty"" ratings, with the top tier cars being easiest, and bottom hardest to drive. The sound is as good as can be expected - it mimics the real life horrible sounds perfectly. Its not Codies fault that Bernie wanted them to sound like this.  After playing a while you get used to it. What still takes a while is the 8 speed gear box. I often found myself only using 7 on some tracks (I hate the 8 speed box,  but this is not a fault of the game)Current car models are spot on for Preseason and early season spec (as are the paint schemes). Easily remidied with skin mods. The stock skins are a nice quality but lack detail and realism. The new tracks are a blast to drive! A1 ring is awesome fun.  The rubbered in racing line works perfectly (as does drying line) right out of the box.. Also track lighting seems to be specific for actual race start times  - ie. Melbourne is not in noon day sun but afternoon lighting with shadows across the front stretch. The Ai is still stupid, but it will fight you harder, which makes offline racing fun. Positions between them change frequently - its no longer follow the leader. I have yet to really delve into the online racing aspect of this title, but hopefully its improved over 2010 - 11-12-13. From a short test I noticed that theres no warping of cars into the track. In the end, if you are a die-hard F1 fan or race enthusiast - this game will give you hours of enjoyment. Take it at face value - a game, and you wont be disappointed. Like stated earlier, if you were expecting a massive new update for the series, wait until F1 2015.  * If you look at the reviews you will see that 90% of the ""thumbs down"" reviews come from people with less than 1/2 an hour in game, who are complaining about handling... but they have not played nearly enough time to set up a controller properly.

												I have played all of the Codemaster F1 games, and most F1 games going back to the Geoff Crammond series. I would say I have a long view of the genre at this point.With that in mind, I would say that this game is quite good, and continues the incremental refinement that the series has enjoyed since 2010. You may have seen that the series has gotten lower review scores year after year, and that has more to do with the nature of yearly sports releases than anything about the game itself. 2013 was clearly a high point for the series, and it didn't have the scores that 2012 had, despite having tons of classic content, as well as a decently fleshed out career mode. One of the few shortcomings of the series is the continued lack of telemetry, which makes car setups a little less scientific than they could be.Codemasters have a fantastic physics engine, and have successfully modeled these new engines and that just-on-the-verge-of-snapping-the-rear feel that this season's pilots have to deal with. Lots of fun. The tire models have also changed, as in real life, with much more predicable, though probably too conservative, tire life (at least for my taste).The classic content is missed, along with the Young Driver Weekend, though I still have F1 2013 if I ever get the urge to drive Niki Lauda's Ferrari at Estoril, Portugal.If I look at this game without any prior context, is it worth it? Certainly, yes. It's a stripped down F1 game, no doubt, but when all of the rule changes, engine outputs, tire compounds, etc., it's quite a feat that Codemasters was able to release this game during their usual release window at all. I'll definitely be looking forward to F1 2015 which promises a bigger evolution in presentation. I give this an 8/10 so far.A final note: I loved the Geoff Crammond games, but anyone who says they were superior has selective memory. They were amazing for their time, but do not stand up to today's racers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really want to enjoy this game. As someone that has played F1 2011 onward this is somewhat dissapointing, it's far too Arcady for me, F1 2013 was a good challenge, this isn't, even with all driver assists off the car is easy to control. The steering does not feel connected to the car at all, when I'm stood still and I turn my wheel 90 degrees, the wheel in the car does the same, when I'm moving this is not true, there is still assistance on the steering and it really frustrates me. I never know how much I need to turn the wheel to go through a corner, because it changes depending on how the game feels.It's a big shame, but save your money and get F1 2013, or for a really good experience, iRacing. Hopefully CM will fix this for F1 2015, but I won't be pre-ordering this time.			",303,44,31,13,40,5,52

												Last F1 game on older engine, hence pretty much the only option for people who want V6 hybrid era F1 game and their PC is unable to run newer games well. Generally speaking at it's release it was very lacking in terms of content and features compared to packed 2013, but don't let that stop you from buying this game if you fit into group mentioned above - it's great option for people who don't have powerful enough PC to play F1 2016 (best one to date).AI in this game is surprisingly race competent after first two laps - in first lap it straight up sucks no matter what difficulty level, but then it's actually quite fun to race against as long as you follow clean driving rules and don't try to scare them off with overly excessive weaving or real-life banned blocking moves.In terms of racing performace, game specifically follows 2014 rules, hence cars feel damn heavy, slow and sometimes more annoying than fun to drive. On the other hand though, setting consistent fast laps is definitely more challenging in 2014 compared to any previous Codemasters F1 game. The game itself provides not much content beyond standard 2014 season racing, but don't let that scare you off.As I said, this game is the last one to make use of old engine, and that also means that it's the last one that is relatively easy to modify, and that's where this game's strength really comes up. You can mod everything from driver's performances to tracks, cars, pretty much anything - although models wise you are limited with what Codemasters made in their previous F1 games.That itself allows for alot of fun though - you can mod in 90s/80s seasons (that is if you don't mind track/car model inaccuracies), you can mod in 2016 season, you can mod in harder racing AI, you can mod in slightly better visuals, you can mod in super season that combines all the tracks from previous games that weren't available in newer games. You name it - what was made for older F1 Codemasters games, you can mod it into this game to get ultimate V6 hybrid era experience.And if you ask me, season with Istanbul park, Imola, Jérez and many other circuits added to the classic mix of current F1 circuits is alot of fun. And yes, you can also make cars way more grippier and faster. It takes some will and fine tuning to find what exactly suits your style, but once you do that, this game is pretty much the best sim/arcade F1 experience you can get if we don't count F1 2016.Vanilla F1 2014 is like 7/10. Modded F1 2014 to your liking is solid 8.5/10. Just don't buy it for multiplayer, it's pretty much dead as everybody already moved onto newer games...			",93,12,4,6,4,1,9

												F1 2014 was a game of 2 sides for me, when I played it. When I got it initially I absolutely despised the lackustre and lethargic handling model that you had to put up with when driving on a controller, and the wheel users were never happy with their traction control misfit. I had no reason to actually play it after a while, as F1 2013 did everything it did, but in the case of handling (in my opinion), online and extra content (classic cars), better.However, through time, as the price dropped and it went on sale for a miniscule fiver odd in the Autumn sale, I decided to buy it again along with all the PS3 generation F1 games in a bundle, this time of course, on PC. And I loved it.Why? Because I'd learnt to deal with the understeering handling model, as the previous couple years had improved my skill and patience with the game (not saying you need to be a pro to play this game, quite the opposite), and to be honest, it's probably one of the most realistic handling systems of all the old-gen games. That helped me through playing it.However, by far the biggest things that made me adore this again were the PC aspects to it; modding and graphics. If you buy this game on console now, you should reconsider your life choices. However, as the newest of the massively moddable Codemasters F1 games I automatically like it. The graphics too; all of these older games are SO easy to run, this not really being an exception, and they look so good on highest settings even before the endless graphics mods. It's a good game (WITH MODS), and in the sale if you are an F1 fan whatsoever with a computer with any graphics card then definitely buy.Pros:Easiest pick-up-and-play of them allMASSIVELY moddableEasy to runGood graphicsGreat value on saleAll good mods are freeDecent handling modelA good amount of things to do (scenario mode, time attack etc.)Good online systemCons:Pad/wheel biasLame handlingLess than impressive car soundNo more classic editionA little online lagLess than impressive AINo next gen auraAverage damage modelHowever, all handling model characteristics, engine sound, damage model and AI characteristics can be, you guessed it, modded! And that's why this game gets a large recommend from me; on console, it'd get a massive thumbs down. However, this is worth the money, definitely so when on sale, so get it!			",21,0,15,0,9,1,0

												This game gets a lot of hate but I personally preferred it to F1 2013.  Simply because I find it more accessible as a more casual player who uses a gamepad.  F1 2014 is more pad friendly, and overall more forgiving than F1 2013 in my opinion.  I am not saying 'it is better than F1 2013' because that's purely a matter of opinion and depends what sort of game you prefer.   I got it cheap and for what I paid I've more than had my money's worth and enjoyment from it.			",134,23,26,12,10,3,11

												I have not yet completed a single lap in this game because I spend all my time fiddling with the various settings on my controller and trying to get the car set up just right for me. I haven't yet gotten there, but each set of tweaks gets me a bit closer. And you know what? I'm actually enjoying the ride.Now, to be clear this is a Codemaster game which means you, the user, get treated like ****. There is no tutorial, no explination for what different things mean, and even the control settings are in a hidden menu that once you do find, has no explinations attached. You are 100% on your own, which means hours of frustartion and grief as you try to learn how to race this game, which is completley different from every other racing game beacause that's just what Codemasters does. Throw you in the deep end lacking any floation device or instruction, a lead weight around your ankle, and your only guide a sign that says ""Don't Srown.""Also, don't ever expect help with setting up if you are using a controller. The people on the internet will openly mock and belittle you for not spending $500 on a dedicated racing setup with a wheel. This is just the way the racing game world works. They like it complex and arcane and difficult to figure out because it gives them elite status, and Codemasters openly panders to that type of player. All that being said. I am still having fun with this game. If you can wade through the complete and total lack of any help whatsoever and the wheel-trolls there is a fun game hiding underneath. Even for those of us casual slobs who insist on using a controller. :)			",157,23,30,29,14,1,22

												This is a game that feels like a low-effort gap filler thrown out to fill the gap between F1 2013 (the last ""good"" game of this generation) and F1 2015 (the first game on next-gen).Even basics are poorly done - such as the Williams being set in the game's data files to a Renault engine rather than a Mercedes.With mods to rebalance the cars and correct things like cars with the wrong engines, it's a lot better.But don't bother with it now. Just buy F1 2015 and play the 2014 season mode instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As time changed my opinion about this game changed too. Just realised how crap this game really is.Very few changes from 2013 only BAD CHANGES.For me the biggest con is the handling despite being a pad user. I hate that I have very bad grip in high speed the car just doesn't wanna f__ turnin, when you are in slow speed corners the entire thing is just so crap, you drift fullthrottle through every single accelaration zone, the car isn't a challange to drive. NO LOCKUPS even, in high large brakes I can barely lockup in the wet with abs off. In my opinion if u want a good experience u better DON'T get this game.Becuase on this game you DONT NEED TO BE SKILLED TO BE FAST,  you just need to full throttle and full brake out of every corner, also didn't even talk about the mariokarting where u go down to lean and just full throttle and upshift.. just disgusting.Leagues have been ruined thanks to the handling too, people couldnt do wet races also people had to make seperate pad and wheel leagues because of the pad having overpowered traction, which was crazy, there are many videos about it on youtube.By the way you cannot say that I dislike this game because I suck at it. Because I am in the top 50 in some of the tracks in time trial.Final thoughts: Don't get this game I do regret getting it. Just get f1 2013 or f1 2010 they are the best. Don't ask me about f12015 but I heard that has issues too so yeah. Thanks for reading.			",3,1,4,0,3,0,0

												To be perfectly honest, dont buy this game if you are patient enough to wait for the next gen version. This game has only gone down hill. The only reason i will get many hours on this game, is because i consider myself relatively good at the game (So i can race competitively in leagues) but its also F1. Thats the only things that are keeping me interested in playing it.There are still many bugs and glitches that NEED to be fixed. There are many issues regarding Pad users and Wheel users in which the two are very unbalanced seeing the pad users to have a lot more traction. Now if you are simply the arcade 'career' mode racer (which i have nothing against) Then fine you may enjoy this game. However if you are interested in actually getting some sort of immersion and competitiveness out of this game, you wont find it unless there is a patch for this bug, which i doubt will happen. Its a poor effort F1 2014. To be honest it doesnt even replicate the 2014 season very well either. The engines sound poor, the steering wheels arent replicas to real life, its just a copy paste of 2013, but with different sounds and lower downforce. Get it on a sale or something.. There is no way this game is worth £30 of your money.			",50,1,17,7,3,0,4

But with all the additional content 2013 has, and being the same price (May get it even cheaper in a Steam Sale) I'd rather recommened that version. Besides some rule changes and the Russian Grand Prix, there's nothing new to be found in this version plus no classic modes found in 2013			",723,169,31,81,50,21,55

												Here's a little comparison between F1 games that I own:F1 2012: Great value, great handling physics, capable but not overwhelming AI (AI is at the sweetest spot imo), a minor bug in helmet visor texture, still looks good for 2016's standard, cars have V8 engine with awesome sound and you get to race as or with Michael Schumacher (2012 is his final racing year)F1 2013: Bad value since it's not been discounted for couple years now, at slow speeds the cars are more twitchy while at higher speeds the cars feel a tiny bit more arcade than F1 2012, rather overwhelming AI that can shock new players, bug: AI water spray isn't being shown in replay, a bit prettier than F1 2012, cars have V8 engine with awesome sound though there's no longer Michael Schumacher in the game, DLCs allow you to race in 1980s and 1990s F1 cars although the track and team lists are lacking.F1 2014: Good value when discounted, handling is quite a bit more arcade compared to previous iterations and suffers from understeer, good AI that's not as overwhelming as F1 2013, bug: AI water spray isn't being shown in replay, prettier than F1 2013, all teams are unlocked from the start in career mode so you don't have to start in a low tier team, has unlimited replay option that alleviates any worry of you ruining a race due to short lapses of concentration, cars have new turbocharged V6 engine with underwhelming sound...

												Firstly, I'd like to start by mentioning that this is quite a large improvement in comparison to the 2013 game. It is similar, but Codemasters have added quite a few different tweaks to spice up the F1 experience. Apparently, a lot of people didn't like the 2015 edition so this is why I went for the 2014 one. Overall, I am extremely pleased with my purchase, especially as I snatched up this game while it was on offer. There has most certainly been an improvement in the graphics in comparison to the 2013 game, which is more noticeable on the street circuits, where the graphics are the most demanding on your system. All of the teams and drivers and circuits have been fully updated to match the 2014 season. I like the new Sochi track in Russia which offers quite a challenging driving experience. Also, it's cool that they brought back the old track in Austria. The F1 Classics is not included in the 2014 game, but I didn't really use it much anyway, so it's not a big loss. If you liked the Classics last year, then I would probably suggest sticking with the 2013 edition. So overall, I recommend this game to anyone who is up for an challenge in the world of F1 racing.

If you fancy a good challenge the AI can be tough to beat when you dial up the difficulty and the career is a real good way to test yourself by starting from the bottom and working your way up to the top teams.

												Ok first thing is first, use the game is basically a modification on 2013 but with updated tracks, models etc.Now that is out the way, the game does offer alot of playability, there are some force feedback bugs but just turn on VSync. Bugs that where in 2013 are in this game and there are a couple AI issues too. you can get around all this with mods or just playing the game around the bugs.People complain about lack of grip/downforce etc. But you have to realise that the  game is replicating real Formula 1 so if F1 rules state less downforce then the game is going to have to do that too. another complaint i hear is the sound of the cars. That is not codemaster's fault so you cant blame them.The career length can be adjusted to suit you as well as the race weekend length which is a nice touchOverall the game is ""ok"" at best and online play is not much to be desired. Playing Co-op or single player is best you get from the game. If your new to the F1 franchise then i would not recommend this title, F1 2013 is better for you. if you like F1 and used to the codemaster bugs etc then i would recommend it. its a fun game and overall its the change of the cars that make it fun and new.

												Great game....just watch for Hamiltons dive bombs...I hadn't played this game much as  I had the previous installments but when 2015 came out and had basically no features I decided to play this some more. I have completed about a season and a half on career. It seems to be much more enjoyable if you start with a lower team (I actually started with Marussia) and worked my way up (currently racing for Torro Roso.), which presents the greatest challenge. You won't win all the races or blow the competition out of the water...as a matter of fact, you will most likely be lapped and left in the dust. But doing this has led me to be a better racer so it is what I would suggest. The career isn't quite as immerisive as it was way back in the early games but it is still a lot of fun....and present unlike in 2015. I have been racing a Coop season with a friend and I must say, it has gone pretty seemlessly. Any online racing I have done on 2015 has been laggy and half the time cars just ghost and the race becomes a time trial which is boring. If you want a techincal racing game that is going to take some time to really become proficient at....this is your game. If you don't like a bit of a challenge, then you will probably be frustrated by this game, but overall this game I would give an 8/10.			",280,29,26,45,150,3,134

A sim race fan who has not played an F1 game since 98' on Playstation 1.As this is the first of my PC F1 game purchases I don't feel ripped off by lack of content, I got what I paid for, which is a visually attractive and reasonably realistic feeling racing simulation.It does not compare to iRacing, but it is still a hell of a lot of fun!

												Solid racing experince, good challenge at every level. Im used to my NASCAR cars, and F1 is a lot more unforgiving, I love it. Pit strategy can win or lose you a race. Racing through the rain with worn out slicks was probably one of my favorite moments in this game. The lack of control at such a high speed really would keep anyone on their toes. It feels well put together, and is a solid, challenging game.			",56,6,12,12,37,0,10

												This is an amazing Formula 1 simulation, although, the career mode is only restricted to 5 seasons, but don't let that disappoint you. The races are so enjoyable and challenging that you'll want to forget all the flaws of the game and just feel the pleasure of pure driving, which is also challenging itself, as the car responds to different track conditions and different setups. Multiplayer-wise, I hope there are still people out there playing 2014 instead of 2015.			",34,4,15,8,5,1,1

												If you don't have any other of the F1 games this is one of the better ones.  it's not really with the upgrade at full or half price if you have a previous version.Personally 2013/2014 are about the same quality for me.  2014 has the best handling.  2013, I have a soft spot for Imola.2015 is a buggy horrendous mess that I never got to play due to bugs, crashing and ultimately steam refunding.

												Great game, already way better then all previous versions. Focus was finally put to more realism and simulation. Great fun even with Keyboard steering! Nice carreer options, the Time Attack was a bit too easy, Scenario mode is awesome, and Season Challenge is still as nice! Graphics are stunning as always, only real con to this game is the Williams MARTINI livery being ""censored"" globally because the few countries this game is sold, alcohol is banned. Further more, great semi-sim F1 game, highly recommended as follow up from 2010-2013!			",283,133,69,17,43,6,10

												A great update to the 2013 title. Sure, not a lot has been changed with this title, but that doesn't mean it's bad.It has a really challenging handling model, with a wheel, you need to feather the throttle to try to minimise wheelspin. Sudden direction changes will disrupt the cars balance so beware. With manual gear shifting it's easier to control the massive torque you get with this game. For those reasons I find this title really fun. It's great fun learning to apply the throttle & it's really challenging to find the right gear to enter and exit a corner to deal with tyre degredation.At the same time it's a shame they haven't taken the game up a level in terms of content and variety of content. There's not a whole lot here. Wet weather is almost undriveable & there are mods out there already to remove rain from the game, which is sad, but it's impossible to drive with aids off.The reintroduction of the short career season is nice. I like 7 race seasons.All in all, it's a fun game with a challenging handling model. I recommend those with a wheel to just turn all assists off & enjoy the game how it should be played. Don't buy the game expecting it to be revolutionary, buy it as an expansion to the 2013 game, an upgrade on an already fairly enjoyable series.			",110,10,29,9,21,2,11

Posted: September 8, 2015
												Ok I am a newbie to this game series. I do own all of the Grid series and I really like Grid Autosport. So I do watch the F1 series on television. The game to start with is not newbie friendly more like anti newbie friendly. The game gives you next to no information about how to change the wings on your F1 car. It gives you no information about the DRS system and how to use it. It does give you an evaluation test that in my opinion is useless that is supposed to set the difficulty automatically for you. Mine was very easy I later did a custom job as I couldnt stand a lot of the hand holding. Just one other point I should point out the AI has no tire wear in bad weather. They do pit but its a script. So in bad weather good luck to you.I know so far it sounds like I hated this game. Not so. I do enjoy the tracks, the graphics and sounds of the racing. Its great. In clear weather racing its fun and interesting. They have a ton of different teams you can join and the best part is the game its modable. Their is even an alpha to update the game to 2015 colors for cars and tracks. Great stuff.  Mods are at Racedepartment.com As I have mentioned before the game can be tailored to your liking. Make it  easy or maybe a mix of very easy and easy. Your choice. If you have all the assists to max its very doubtful your going to go flying off the track. The AI is a mixture of good and bad. Your rival who you can pick will end up being a great driver by the end of the season. He might start of terrible but as you soon as you pick him. Surprise he is suddenly a great driver. This is annoying.You do have a partner and unlike Grid Autosport he is actually able to be in the top 10 usually. I do think however that had Grid autosport allowed Open-Wheel cars to pit that it would have a sizeable advantage over this game. The game is fun however its also very annoying as well. Due to the AI not having tires degrade in bad weather puts the human player at a big disadvantage. I should add I played this with a xbox360 controller. I do recommend this game only if its on sale. I payed $11 dollars for it and feel like I have already gotten my moneys worth out of the game. So their you have it. I would rate this game an 8/10 right now just based on my play time with it. Also I should mention that I did win the first seasonal championship in the game. I would like to add one more item. This game is not a true to life simulator. I would call it sim lite. My main issue with the game is the way the players car turns. Turn off the assists and it turns like a school bus. Also the back end gives out a lot more then it should. I have never driven a f1 in my entire life but watching them on television only. The handling feels off somehow. I honestly feel like Grid autosport is more true to life as far as open wheel handeling and what you would think the cars would drive like. Sticky tires and able to turn hard into a corner without the back end shooting out  all over the place.			",299,147,32,35,36,9,44

												I've had it since release day and currently not sure how I fall on this one.Essentially F1 2013 updated for the season (same engineer, voice commands etc), Codies have at least incorporated the new rules to a great(ish) extent. You'll now take the tyres you set your fastest lap in Q2 into the race so you can go balls-out (if you make it) in Q3 for pole with a set of the softs.The sounds in general seem pretty good. The engines of the three maufacturers are represented and could be recognised from the onboard footage I watch week in week out on the BBC, Sky, F1.com, YouTube etc.In terms of gameplay it appears fairly accurate. The Mercedes disappear up the road and the WIlliams, Red Bulls, Ferraris and to a lesser extent, the McLarens, scrap over the other podium spout and the top 10 order.The total lack of control of ERS is a significant negative for this game though. In a year where the charging and discharging of the non-combustion engine has become an even more pivotal role Codemasters decides to bottle it and take that away from the driver.The ""classic"" content from F1 2013 was a huge plus and one I revelled in personally. To not only not improve on but to remove it from the franchise was a bit of a kick in the teeth. The Scenarios and Season Challenges are welcome continues but it feels somewhat lacking. These new generation turbo cars would be complemented by some 1980s turbo kit.Multiplayer-wise, to date, I've really struggled with this game personally. I've probably spent more time in lobbies than I have racing. Can't think of a game version I've not tried and a lot of games have just ended up being full of kids with keyboards; no interest in a race. Just a destruction derby a lot of the time. I have no time for people who don't leave you room and would rather turn into an accident, lock wheels, than turn away and maintain momentum.Right now I don't think I'd recommend it as you can be charged a bit of a silly price for it. With it not being next-gen and most of my friends eing on Xbox One or PS4 I've not had to shell out for a console version as well this year.Do I recommend this game? As it stands, unlesss you're a big F1 fan - and you don't already own it - I'd say no and I wasn't expecting to say that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Think of F1 2014 as a DLC for 2013, with 2 new tracks, updated driver lineup and cars, new scenarios and a slight rework of the career mode (the choice of a shorter season), that carries a bug that erases classic mode. If that package is worth the price to you, then buy it, and I think most fans fall into this category. If you don't care about keeping up to date and just want a good and fun racing game, stick to 2013.			",23,1,8,0,15,0,2

												Career mode has received absolutely no significant updates, you cannot pick your driver number, your racing suit has the name and nationality of the driver you are replacing, there are no podium celebrations, and certain tracks have not been updated, notably Monza, the runoff of parabolica is not paved as it was this year.The fact that F1 classics is missing also takes away from a game that is only a slightly changed version of F1 2013. Don't waste your money on this game.			",46,5,6,8,22,0,10

My best track is Russia, where I just accelerate out of the corner :DThe handling isn't so good, it turns very badly through the corners and sometimes makes me go off the track. Career has been fun so far even though I have done 1 race.The AI are slow in this game as well, they brake way too early but I can still race with them :)In conclusion, F1 2014 is a good game in my opinion and is worth buying.

												Disclaimer: If there was an option to give the game a ""mixed feelings"" option instead of just Yes or No, I would choose that. Since Yes and No are the two options, however, I'll give it a Yes.With the livery of every single car, the engine sounds, gears and everything else changed to match the 2014 season, I expected great things from this game. However... after I bought it (on sale, mind you), I remembered how quickly I got bored of F1 2013, and that game had many more features such as the Classic cars and tracks. I started to think I had made a massive mistake. Once I got into the game, though, I felt like it wasn't all that bad. The cars were nice to drive and the new tracks were very well done. I did face the same problem I did in 2013 and that was the Intermediate difficulty was too easy for me and the Expert difficulty was just too hard, but that's probably just me.Overall I would recommend this game, but I'd advise you only buy it if it's on sale. It's not worth paying full price for it if you have any of the older games.			",83,7,11,0,14,1,4

												Whilst I'm actually very much enjoying this game I have to say it's a bit of an insult to loyal fans of the series which is why I can't recommend it. So what if they are concentrating their efforts on the new next gen version, if that's the case then the release price of this game should have reflected that.It's a very lazy 'update' that is made apparent when you first see your car being pushed back into the garage. The guy standing at the front of the car is pushing last years model and his hands are more than a foot away from the new cars and is very offputting, immediately detracting from any realism you were hoping to feel.AI is just as dumb when it comes to moving off the racing line and will smash into you rather than avoid you if you are going slower on an out lap.The rules can be totally ignored by the AI drivers which is especially evident when there's a safety car out. For example, I'm leading the race and lined up behind the safety car, just going into the final bend where the SC is about to go into the pits, nowhere near the finish/start line. The car in second place speeds past me and I get disqualified for overtaking with a safety car out.So basically it's still plagued by the many bugs/flaws of its predessors and has to rank among the laziest 'updates' I've ever played, yet still I enjoy the game. Weird I know but that's how it is. ",174,31,21,12,28,3,5

												Straight to the point:Pros:- Amazing steering wheel response, made it feasible to use one and be good at it- good graphics- that darned young driver test is gone- season length options; haven't decided to use them, but that's a nice feature if you are looking for a smaller season to run- The cars handle FAR differently than in 2013/2012 (new cars and all) possibly contributing to point #1- difficulty rating for each teamCons:- still wish I could use my steering wheel to it's max (it's a weak con, I know)- This section will permanently remain mostly empty			",28,1,8,20,1,0,2

												I am a huge F1 fan and was very excited about purchasing this game. However there are still bugs in the game. When I am racing in career mode the screen jumps suddenly from left or right depending on where I am turning on the circuit and the gear box goes crazy!! It jumps from gears without me initiating it and the throttle control is dampened when I need to be full throttle coming out of turns. The graphics are excellent and the gameplay is awesome when it isn't bugging out and costing me positions in races in career mode as well as Grand Prix mode. Very disappointing with the rushed release and the very unplayable bugs still exisiting in the game. I am using a Lenovo Y580 with a NVIDIA Geforce GTX 660M with 2 gbs of dedicated video memory, with Intel I7 quad core, and 8 gbs of ram. I don't think it is my computer but hopefully the game.

												At this point in time I can not recommend the game due to its poor wheel support I was hoping for a lot more in a way of settings I have full rig and this game does not use my setups full potential.I spent close to an hour trying to find a suitable setting through the game and through the profiler with no luck.I thought 2014 may be a little different to the rest but its pretty much the same just with a make over and some new tracksI will follow codemasters and see if they tweak the wheel support feels like the game is more controller basedIf it's on special grab it but at the current price unless you're a dedicated F1 fan it's not worth the money I will update and change review if anything changes but for now wait for F1 2015			",774,218,87,75,121,7,150

												I seem to be saying it year after year; F1 2011 is Codemasters finest Formula One game. It's disappointing to say it once more, but it's fact. This 2014 game is a step forward in on track driving but still lacking in immersion off track. The game is enjoyable on the whole and the price drop is welcome since there is alot of copy paste going on.The ontrack handling is very enjoyable requiring skill but the cars are more realistic and manageable, the brakes on the other hand seem to have been dumbed down in difficulty. You can really push the brakes now and there is a nice little audible that give you a hint in advance of any lockup. It seems to work well for gameplay.The lack of traction in general has made racing the cars on the limit a hell of a lot of fun and very satisfying in getting those perfect laps, or if you over cook it a little and go into a drift. The rules changed and removed KERS making overtaking a little trickier, but that in turn made successful overtaking more satifying.The AI is still not very bright; at overtaking and can easily be lead into trying it around the outside, where it has to slot back in behind. Also sometimes it get offline and seem to just give up trying to take the corner and lets numerous cars go by before it slots back into the train.There's no 3D modelled interactive agent, no paddock or motor homes. No interaction with the media and no press interviews for podiums. All hurting the game series since losing it in 2012. The animations are all old, even the HUD graphics are 99% from F1 2013. I'd recommend it just on the racing, but without the immersion it falls down to it's older brother, F1 2011.Don't get me wrong it's a step in the right direction, but I wouldn't endorse it as is to friends when F1 2011 exists.F1 2011 might be outdated, but it holds all the longevity gameplay items the newer F1 games by codemasters can only dream about,			",88,10,32,14,55,0,23

												The F1 game just got better.The most noticible change is the handling. I use a gamepad and on F1 2013 quite often skided around every bend burning out the tires in no time at all, but in F1 2014 for me this has been resolved and I'm enjoying the game a lot more. Multiplayer games has been close fun battles and the KERs has gone so no more KERs hack for those cheaters out there.One downside, sidepod glitch still remains in game, so do not touch sidepods or you'll end up in a spin :) ",284,122,52,32,80,8,88

												F1 2014 could be almost a perfect game with a much higher rating if it were not for two things. Firstly, as with any serious simulator, F1 2014 is designed for high-end PCs with the decent wheel and analog pedals that allow precise acceleration and braking. When you try to play on the console or with a gamepad, you’ll be severely disappointed: the game even on the Very Hard setting will became much easier. The second major drawback is the lack of full replays.76/100			",48,3,2,0,7,0,2

												It might be the same as F1 2013 in visuals, but in terms of car performance and handling, it is completely different. This is probably the most accessible game so far in the series, but once you turn driver aids off it is a whole other beast. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good game to dive into immediately, but if you are looking for a simulator try something else.			",45,3,11,3,5,1,3

												This game is the third consecutive F1 instalment I played and third that’s probably going to get more than 100 hrs of my attention. Even though people bash this game for basically everything from graphics to content-related mistakes to less fun from the gameplay, I found it just as enjoyable as 2012 and 2013. Why do I like it?Basically it’s a new formula. New teams, new cars, new steering wheels, new rules. I was actually shocked by how much the car handling has changed. When I stopped playing 2013 game I was ruling the grid in a Lotus (4th best team of the season) with legendary AI setting and all assists off. I got into 2014 Ferrari using the same difficulty settings and in the first race qualified… 18th. The game is still demanding (maybe even more), some new aspects of driving were tweaked (in this one you can see and feel tyres cooling down on long straights, which creates a new set of challenges). And even though Mercedes are quite dominant in the game it is possible to win driving a different car, and some race events (like mid-race rainfall) can shuffle the grid in a way which creates way more interesting result than in real F1 timetables. The game surely isn’t flawless, but its strong roots still make it a solid product. Why some people have a point bashing this game?Yes, the new cars don’t have KERS, so there is no “boost” button to press when you feel you’re not fast enough. Presence of the 8th gear isn’t much of addition in terms of gameplay. Yes, Williams definitely has the wrong steering wheel. And yes, some tracks are unchanged, even though some of them were in reality altered for 2014 season. This last one isn’t entirely true. Canadian GP has a modified asphalt run-off area which was covered with grass in 2013, and some new buildings appeared in Monaco (most notably on the left of the famous tunnel exit). Plus two completely new tracks appeared on the calendar. The fact that some tracks were updated, while others were just pasted form the previous game makes me feel that development of the game was cut short at some stage. I still love the graphics, but what I have a problem with is that the cars somehow got ugly on the details. And I don’t mean generally uglier car designs. In 2013 I loved the front wing camera in the replays, in 2014 it just shows how underdeveloped the car model is in terms of detail. Just closely watch the nose and floor of Ferrari F14T – you’ll notice some very crude edges and weird shapes. Some people say that this game is just a 2013 mod featuring new cars. Sadly I have to agree. The full price is regrettable. Probably marketing strategy is meant make money of the newcomers. A person who had the previous game and buys this one for a full price may get furious. Do I recommend it?Let’s say a conditional “YES”. I marked “recommend” for this review because I have positive feelings about the game. But it clearly does not deserve thumbs up and “hell yeah”. You should definitely buy this game IF you are an F1 fan who wants to experience how formula changed in 2014, or if you like race simulations and haven’t tried F1 yet. And most definitely if you find this game on sale. The 2015 game will hopefully be better and all “next-gen”, but so far this is the only one with turbo engine F1 cars. PS: Fromula 1 fan ranting (you can stop reading, unless you are an F1 fan too, or a 2015 developer :)I found that the game was dumbed down a bit in terms of campaign interface, first race and team choosing. It’s nice that you can now select “length” of the season (number of featured races), but if they add an option of shortening a season I’d like to manually discard some of the races from the calendar. Some people liked replacing testing day with a simple racing sequence to evaluate player’s skills, like in GRID series. But I’m afraid it doesn’t work too well. When I tried it I found that it was around 1 lap of the simplest track (Monza) and all the assists were by default on. I almost crashed on the first corner when I started fighting with AUTOMATIC gearbox in an F1 car. Nice for newcomers, but will irritate the hell of the gamers who actually know what they’re doing. Also now you get to choose ANY team at the start of your career. A rookie in Mercedes AMG? Why the hell not. It actually doesn’t bother me since everybody can immediately choose their favourite team, and not struggle with Marussia or Caterham (yuck) for at least half of the season. What bothers me is that the team’s performance is defined at the starting point. Generally the developers decided that the big three is Mercedes, Red Bull, and Ferrari. This hurts Williams which had a terrific 2014 season and their performance in the game is way lower than it should be.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've played it for some hours now and really liking it. Even with only an Xbox 360 controller it can be really enjoyable. I feel like the difficulty level has gone down a bit playing on Legend difficulty, but for me it doesn't really matter as I find that extremely challenging anyway :). There are no major differences from the previous F1 2013 in terms of car handling or overall game performance. The only difference is the new cars and some other stuff so if you aren't sure if you want to buy it or not I'd say wait. Wait until it gets cheaper or buy from a cheaper retailer (like I did). The graphics compared to previous game is the same. Completely the same no difference and still no SLI support (as if it's needed haha). However, overall it's a good game but I think there's not enough fun in it for it to be able to attract any non-F1 fans. I'd say I recommend it... yes I would.			",56,2,7,2,8,1,0

												A reskinned version of 2013 with little to no improvements. Uses the same outdated game engine of 2013 just with a different paint coat. Even the devs admited this years version was a reskin push out that they spent little time or effort on to focus on the new next gen game engine that '15 and '16 use. Also lacks the force feedback and wheel weight for newer wheels (g29 / ts300 ect) just like 2013 does.All in all, at this point 2014 is a pointless title that doesn't substancially improve on 2013 and is inferiour to 2015+ (ESP '16) in every single aspect from graphics to espcially car simulation, handling, braking, AI, tire ware, fuel consumption, weight transfer, ect ect. If you have a newer wheel like g29 / ts300 that work with the next gen consoles then you can forget F1 titles prior to 2015 (the first next gen only f1 title) as the force feedback doesn't work with the last gen games ('14 and eariler).Now that 2016 is out it puts this and all previous titles to shame in every way, but especially this one as '14 is by far the worst of them. If you want the full, most immersive F1 experience, with the best features, then get '16.			",98,24,7,21,8,1,26

												Now I don't play many racing games on my PC (long live the xbox360) but my buddy shared this with me from the family thing and I thought I would give it a go, now the last f1 racer was the Codemasters/ego 2011 game and to accounts the only things better is the textures and updated team drivers..The power unit sound is just a loud high pitched whine. the braking actually works but the steering is now bs (playing with a keyboard) so good work the worst and the best part of 2011 game has been swapped. Where did the honest career mode campaign mode go?Maybe it's just being on a PC (that far outstrips my old console) but it seems as a game far worse than 2011 f1.There are plenty of improvements from the radio calls to the degradation and picking up marbles, to the new animations to how you react to impacts.maybe I just like the sport itself too much, or the old game but that's my opinion, if ya want it to take it if not **** of			",117,27,3,10,21,0,12

												In a stub:+ Graphics are awesome- The physics engine is absolutely rubbish, the handling is not at all convincing!DO NOT BUY any of the Codemasters' if you are looking for a realistic racing experience.My story/comments:For a long time I've been playing Grand Prix 3 & 4. I like a realistic racing sim, and these games really hit the mark in physics, although the graphics are outdated. As such, I had tried a demo of F1 2012 a few years ago and recalled I didn't like the handling, but I did appreciat the graphics and detail. As such I thought I'd give Codemasters another go and bought F1 2014. On the plus side, the graphics are amazing even at lower settings, and the attention to details off-track (such as entering & exiting the car) are nice additions that could make a very realistic experience.That said, the basics that the racing experience should build on are - in my opinion - rubbish. Of course I have not driven real F1 cars, but the physics just don't add up to something that represents reality. I tried the standard settings, but also spent numerous hours trying to adjust the handling with the options that are handed to the user. My experience is as follows, using a pistol grip RC racing transmitter:- The steering in-game is considerably slower than my steering input, as if there is a maximum steering input speed. This makes for a dead and disconnected feel to the car and I have to start judging how fast the game will allow me to turn in in order to hit the apex. The appropriate way to go about things is to make the car respond as quickly as I do, at which point the car will respond quickly but (likely) lose balance with under- or oversteer because in reality the cars are not made to turn in so suddenly.- The throttle is ridiculous: It is all too easy to cause wheelspin, which is logical. However in no way the car can break out at the rear more than +- 15 degrees, so the only consequence of too much throttle is less forward drive. This is very noticable in low-speed and long corners and upon exiting corners.- The brakes are like ABS on your road car: However hard you may try, it is near-impossible to get the wheels to lock up, even at the most unforgiving settings.- Going off track is not an issue because the car is won't destabilize like the real thing.- Contact between cars or cars and trackside objects is not convincing: Not only are the cars stronger than they should be, the impacts don't show any sort of absorption, deformation or anything: It's like Codemasters re-invented pong with high resolution rendering.The F1 2012 demo had similar issues, and funnily enough the last Codemasters racing simulator I tried before that (DTM Race Driver 3) had similar issues too. I don't know how they do it, but it's messed up that a game from more than 10 years earlier outperforms their game in how realistic the handling feels. The impression it left on me is that I don't ever have to bother with racing simulators by Codemasters ever again; I'll stick with Geoff Crammond's awesome 'GP4' and with the 'Race' series by SimBin.

Penaltys are no different - still as awful as last years game. Blue flags are terrible.The garage crew are exactly the same as last year. I know this obviously doesn't effect how the game plays... but it does show how lazy Codemasters have been.

First 7.5 Hrs did not let me down.Community is again strong with this one like previous codemaster f1 games and very very very good game if you like f1 games in general.Only things that are minus are Physics,Damage and Career mode.I would improve career mode by adding something like Driver Transfers and Customizable Helmets.I am giving this game 4.5/5			",36,1,4,2,6,3,3

												It's been said many times, YES f1 2014 is a copy/paste of f1 2013. Nothing much more, actually I would say 2014 will give you less...Once this said, the playability of this 2014 is for me 110% much better, the car will feel great to drive. For me, again, f1 2014 is a real joy to play.Only downside, in this opus, is the transition bettween dry/intermediate/wet...it's terrible. If you dare putting wet tyres (can be the case for dry/wet...) when your mecanic tells you to put inter (because I know that 1 or 2 laps later, everyone will put wet anyway), you simply cannot drive the car at all, it is ridiculous, you cannot take the decision yourself, have to wait for the guy to tell you what tyres are required, NO point trying to be clever...you cannot 1 lap on wrong tyres.ANOTHER stepback in 2014, you can qualify in 15+ place, couple of first corners AI are incredibly slow (after that AI are ""fine""), I can easily jump 15 places in 2 corners  !!! this wasn't the case in 2013 !!!I still definitely recommend 2014 (I own all of them) for its playability.£29.99 is a bit too much for improved f1 driving experience; Once on sale, go for it, 110% ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bought during a sale on Steam for under £7. Bargain. Using a wheel and the physics don't seem that bad. You can feel the extra torque that these new cars kick out compared to the old ones in 2013. Game file size was less than 3Gb which was a worry. I'd recommend this game whilst it's on sale but I wouldn't pay any more for it. 7 out of 10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well where do I start. I think ill just emphasise on two to three main points here.#1 Im 22 races into Career mode, I havent had one single circuit without rain in either Prac, Qualifying, Racing. Annoying as hell.#2 Everytime i come in for a pit stop, i get held up to about 7+ seconds, and cars that entered the pit lane 3 seconds behind me get out in front. CONSTANTLY.#3 On Expert AI, I can outrace by 20-40seconds by the end of a 50% race. In Legend mode, i get beat by 20seconds+. Thought it was ment to adjust to your skill level.Overall, Consistantly bad. But I play anyway.			",63,0,7,1,2,0,11

												This game is exactly the same as the last one, oh no wait, it's even worse! The only thing they've changed is the sounds and have made the cars handle rubbish! This is definitely the worse F1 game ever made, I prefered playing F1 2009 on my PSP and that was awful. The AI seems fine in Career hovever, on co-op they seem so OP that you can never seem to keep up! It's the same with general online multiplayer but it seems to be the opposite of co-op as when the cars are set to legend they seem to work as if they are set to amatuer. This is not a years worth of work really disappointed! Wait until F1 2015 guys see if it's any better!Update: F1 2015 is just as♥♥♥♥♥♥as this game...Update:F1 2016 is also a♥♥♥♥♥♥game do not buy...Update: F1 2017 is also a wank game...Update: F1 2018 is just awful.

												If you are a wheel user who is happy to pay for what is essentially the same experience as F1 2013 (and one that has arguably less content) but with the new cars and tracks, then F1 2014 might be for you.However, if you use a controller then steer clear, do not waste your money! The handling model is ruined in this one. Driver aids are forced upon you and it makes everything drive like junk. This is applicable to you whether you used assists before or not. Though if you didn’t use assists then the difference is even more aggravating. All the nice driving feel is gone. For them to claim this was in the name of accessibility is just baffling. The games have always had options to turn assists on for new players. Why couldn’t these new assists be included in said options? How does it make sense to force them upon people who purposefully turn assists off!?What is left is a game where driving is a chore not a challenge. The cars feel awful but at the same time you will find it hard to ever spin or lock a tire. Instead you will be stuck throwing yourself into corners like an idiot because the traction control will just do the work for you, otherwise you can’t keep up. Driving fast with a controller in this game feels like cheating and going back to 2013 I was well aware of how much worse of a driver it had made me.In terms of content the only real addition is a shortened career mode, in which you advance through teams by setting their drivers as rivals and beating them in a best of 3 races. I actually think this is pretty cool and I hope it stays in the series. Apart from that everything is the same but they cut the classic cars and tracks, along with a lot of the new driver testing stuff. This is what you get when you take a franchise that already struggles for new content because of its annual release schedule, then tell the developers they actually have less time than usual because their 2015 version needs to be next gen and released early than usual. Hopefully it makes up for this mess.Skip this one. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Some of the best barrel feta in the city is found just 3 blocks from my house, I make frequent stops there through the month, to assure I always have a fresh stock. Sure I could buy a larger batch to last a little longer but feta clean out of the brine is the way to do it. it taste better, smells better, and is still so moist.Feta is great in salads, on pizza, melted into veggie dishes and can be stuffed into everything from peaches to peppers. But what about just eating it on its own, sure I’ll go to the fridge and nibble on the block but never do I sit down with a fork and knife and go at it. I have to admit its is a very overwhelming cheese, the salt alone would make me want to get up and walk away. But what goes better with salty than sweet, nothing… So here is how you can sit down with a block of feta eat it all and still want more for years to come. The first time I ever tried honey baked feta was in 2009, it is 2012 and Im still thinking about it. Now this can be eaten along side a meal or you can set it out as a toothpick appetizer for a dinner parties.			",79,3,9,4,12,3,3

												I was very disappointed to find that this is very much an arcade style racing game. I wish they're was a way to completely turn off all the assists, meaning even with the assists turned off in the game menu I can definetely still feel the traction control preventing wheel spin.Setting up my T500 will take hours of frustrating testing and tweaking to make it feel like I'm acctually in control of these cars. Code Masters? More like Code ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They've butchered something with great potential by ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥izing the controls and not spending the time to make it feel real.  If you're a 10 year old boy with a game pad, you're gonna love this game. If you're looking for a serious F1 racing experience, look somewhere else.			",121,15,22,6,28,1,9

												I award this game the ""Worse than CoD"" award for recycling not only 2013 in general, but for uses the exact same steering wheel on ALL cars except the RB10 and STR9, along with using LAST YEARS STEERING WHEEL on the Williams.This game is a pathetic cash grab and I feel stupid for trusting that it wouldn't be terrible.Wait for 2015, then wait a week to put down your money on the game.edit: In response to comments.Cars handle practically the same as 2013, not a huge night and day difference like it was between '12 and '13. Not enough there to make it a standout point.No the steering wheels are NOT exactly the same in real life. The electronics behind the systems ARE (provided by Mclaren) but the actual physical designs are NOT.Yes i WILL knock Codemasters for not doing their ♥♥♥♥ing job properly. Yes i WILL knock them for not even ♥♥♥♥ing bothering to remain faithful to the sport in a game where 90% of ALL of 2013 is literally copy/pasted. And no i can't recommend this game on that basis because you're giving Codemasters 50 bucks for a ctrl+C/V.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

As an update to my comment about F1 2015,everyone says not recommended,as i thought,so glad i didnt buy it,hence the comments made here as i cannot review a game i dont own,dont own so very happily.Looks like the only thing codemasters is working on in F1 is reverse gear,they are going backwards with this title,its getting worse,and codemasters keep taking our money thinking ""hey this must be a good game, people are still buying it"".

												Steam is asking me if i would recommend this game. It's hard to recommened wheteher or not to buy this game while these circumstances are messing up with my joy while playing this game. First of all if you are looking for a simulator then this is not a game for you. Even on the hardest difficulty it is very easy to over pass your opponents like if you would be racing on the easiest settings and when it comes for your opponent to overtake you it's nearly impposible for them to do that unless you make a mistake your self. This game needs hell of improvments when it comes to the AI and the most dissapointing thing and which makes me rather say ""do not buy this game"" is that the F1 franchise is lacking on new content. I can assume this game is almost the same thing just as F1 2011 if i don't include in the new main menu, challenges, graphics and drivers and teams.On the other hand graphics are impressive and innovative compared to F1 2011. The career mode gave me the feeling as if i would be an athentic Formula 1 driver, but again it's nothing new. That's about it, I can barely find anything that would satisfy me since i have the feeling of playing a recycled game.If you never purchased an F1 game from codies then go for it, I am pretty sure you wont be dissapointed, but if you already did then stick to your older F1 game and you could just get a MOD for the new seasons. You wont be missing out much.As an F1 consumerist i sense this is a recycled product (not garbage, just recycled), so just go get an older F1 game and say NO to this one.			",14,1,3,1,6,0,3

												I'm a massive F1 fan, I use a G27 wheel. I play a variety of racing games including iRacing, F1 2013 and Asseto Corsa on a semi-regular basis.Codemasters, is a large company with many years of experience.Given that. I should not be able to real of a list of things they should have done better.The Williams livery - no excuse, I should not have to mod an official F1 game (there are already several good mods for this) so that I can have the cars look like they do in real life. It's absolutely ridiculous.The AI - Far worse an effort than last year, the AI feel like they are driving completely different cars to me, at some parts they brake way later than I can, at others, they have so much more grip they must have made their cars from magnets and put iron in the roads. They catapult themselves between far too aggressive and far too meek, almost bi-polar even.In 3 months there will be several high quality AI mods and this complaint will be rendered null, but I shouldn't have to wait until a modder, on his own time makes a mockery of codemasters.The performance - My graphics card is overheating on high settings.Well obviously you say, get a better graphics card! Well, yeah, that too. But I've been playing the older games on the very highest settings, including using graphics enhancing mods and they look ab-so-lute-ly gorgeous. Surely, SURELY I should be able to make use of the same level of graphics? No, I absolutely can't, not only that, but they are significantly worse, the reflections are blocky and the colouration is distorted, the mirrors remind me of my N64 (yes, I exaggerate, but not by nearly enough) (already there are fixes on the steam forum for this, if users can fix it within a few days, why wasn't it like it in the first place?). It's just plain worse. And given that it's pretty much the same game as last year, I shouldn't have that problem.Content - Well, we all knew that this was going to be a stop gap until F1 2015. But that doesn't make it better. This feels very slim compared to the earlier titles.It just frustrates me that these are issues, as sure as the Sun sets there are many other issues, but these strike me in particular as things that are easy to fix, should never have been an issue in the first place or just smack or finances being the goal and not the game.Having said that, it's not all bad. I like the physics changes... But the bugbears have struck first. ",65,13,8,12,38,1,33

												Im a massive F1 fan and have been for years so regardless I was going to purchase this and like previous games its fun if not abit flawed at time of write.  Ai still seem to have no actual tyre wear model and traction out of corners/in wet is still a problem.  I only use a game pad for driving and it feels more sluggish this year and there's no real feel of all the torque this years rules should be giving.  So if you have previous games I would say you can give this one a miss and not feel like you're missing out.  if you've not had one since say f1 2010/2011 maybe you will find more enjoyment in this one.Down the line when its on a daily deal it might be a good time to pick up for people on the fence.  I would reccomend it as its not a terrible game its just when your look at it objectively in the series its not a massive leap but then its not different to all franchise sports games.

												DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOUR USING WINDOWS 10---------------------------------------------------Do not buy not just F1 2014, but any other F1 game if your on Windows 10 especially if your using gamepad as your diving controller. For gamepad users, I assure you everytime you play this game you will get this bug/glitch where your car suddenly starts to move either to the left/right (commonly right). I\'m not fully blaming Codemaster for this bug/glitch, I started to suspect Windows 10 that might cause this problem. Overall the game looks pretty cool, I thank the person who made the graphics look so realistic also the detail in the car, crowd, grass, circuit, etc. Sadly I can\'t give a good review about the game until either Microsoft or Codemaster fix this tiny problem. Remember that many people put a lot of effort into this game! Bought a steering wheel, upgrade their RAM so they can play the game lagless, wasting their time eventhough there are important things to do, and so much more just for a game.Anyway if your using Windows below 10, I can promise you that this and all F1 games works perfect and smoothly (if you have the minimum specs of course).

												If you've played any of the other offerings in this series then this incarnation will be largely familiar. While the handling is quite different and does reflect some of the changes in the 2014 season you could just be driving the old V8s as the developers haven't bothered to implement the more refined features of the 2014 engines. In fact, there are fewer engine features in this game than in the previous games. Now you've just got the loud pedal, the stop pedal and DRS. There's no implementation of boost or energy recovery, something that seems to be a key factor for the real cars. Whether the developers didn't have access to this sort of information, thought it would be too complex for the average gamer or were just too lazy to put it into the game it does mean that if you're thinking of upgrading to the latest version to get the features of the 2014 spec engines then you're going to be disappointed. If you're happy to carry on with the V8s and an earlier driver line up then hang onto your cash and wait for the new technologies to be properly developed.			",110,10,12,19,21,0,38

												Having had a comparision to a long history of F1 Games from early atari via the penical of Geoff Crammond's masterpieces and lows like Alain Prost's racing all the way through to the current crop you can assume two things. I love driving games, especially simulations, and I am a bit of a mug, as I buy (almost) all of them. Seeing the progression of Codemaster efforts I can't help but shake the feeling that they are fallowing the market, no doubt backed up by the in game logging system that shows them statistical distributions of which features are used how often and so on. I am not sure that works for me. In short: This game is great for casual to intermediate racers, but the simplification of the game has taken a lot of the simulation feel away. Please buy it if this is your first go, or if you prefer your racing fast, furious and not too serious/dull. It is definitly great fun and even a bit of a simulation. Having said that, don't be a mug and buy it if you own 2013. Just don't!Long version:On the positive side I think F1 2014 is making a good stab at recreating the new feel of F1. Squeeling tyres, odd engine noises and the changed breaking distances are all reflected. In addition the racing is very emersive and overall the game gives you a good race in most scenarios. For example I expected the new track in Russia to be boring as F1 drivers stated that the simulator didn't represent the real fun of the track, as it flowed much nicer in reality. However when I started timed laps around it I got into a rythm pretty quickly and before long really enjoyed the track, which can only mean one thing: Nice job Coders :)When starting the game you get a nice intro (very much like 2013) and all the visuals are at the same level as 2013 with the odd tweek here and there. For example sparks flying from underneath the car are noticable and sometimes really get into your virtual face. The handling is also improved somewhat with a sharper feel, reflecting the oversteer nature of modern F1 cars. Scenario modes are there as before, increasing in difficulty, but if you have played them in 2013, then 2014 doesn't offer anything new. But scenarios are in general good fun. I found the rain / wet track scenario quite hard but that might just be me. Compared to other online racers, who post rediculously high scores, I seem to be middle of the pack. In a season challange you again get the chance to pick an opponent from anywhere on the grid and as long as you beat them best of 3, then you get their seat. Starting this challange on medium I was surprised to be dumped straight into qualifying on a new track in Austria (although I had vague memories of the layout from F1GP2). Steep learning curve? You bet. Especially for novice drivers.  But great fun. There are some differences that are fairly neutral. No boost button anymore, No gear rations to set and a couple of other minor changes not worth mentioning here. Suffices to say the format of F1 has changed in reality and this game reflects this. But it does lead to less to do and think about. Given that there is little new besides the sound and some drive models I can't shake the feeling that it is too little change for the better. One thing worth mentioning is that if you opt to return to the pits the 2013 version had a nasty habbit of continuing the engine noise. That has been fixed. On the otherhand desperatly trying to switch to a one stop strategy at Imola was impossible, even when calling for option tyres from the car. The pit crew just ignored me forcing me to stop again :(Pit stops, corner cutting penalties and so on have all be retained although the execution has ever so slightly changed (you can switch this penalty off as well ). And this is where my list of gripes start. This should not be taken too seriously but I was hopping since 2011 that this would be fixed and it still hasn't happened:I am missing:1) freedom to set up the car asymetrically (different settings for every corner of the car)2) What about dampers, gearration at the beginning of the season and so on?3) The black and white nature of the commentary and news articles (I raced from last to 8th in a caterham on high difficulty level, one place behind my rival (Vettel) and ended up with an animation of my driver shaking his head in dispair - that does kill the mood4) Why not let us drive the pre-race lap to check out the track?5) cartoon physics and damage model - I am sick and tired of getting nothing but wing damage. Please sort it and negotiate harder with the FIA. This is probably one of my major gripes, especially since it now includes mid air drifting when jumping shikanes (you can try this on most 90 degree corners). It is also still true that in a pile up cars have a tendency to ""stick together"" because the collision detection still does not resolve object interlocking correctly (In the real world two objects hitting each other end up repelling each other, but not here). This has been a basic 3D Vector coding problem since the 1990s, and while some games have managed to solve this, codemasters is alas still stuck in the past (although it is not ruining the game!).  6) The AI still has major flaws around lapping (slowing on the racing line most of the times when met in corners) and their tendency to drive into you from behind at the start of races is also somewhat annoying (of course with no penalty).7)  Can we have a story line please? You sort of had a half hearted story in an earlier version but killed it. 8) Please give us better grafics than the playstation. We can handle it.9) I would like testing (could also be the tsrat of the story line) - especially pre-season to help with developing the car in a direction I like. 10) accuracy of the penalty system is still poor. Sorry, but if 2 wheel are still on the road (U-Turn in Canada) even if the other two are not, then there should be no penalty - just as an example. 11) Career progression is unrealistic. If you drive the socks of a Caterham and continously put it in the top 10 over 5 races in the season you will be offered a contract by one of the top 3 teams. But not in this game. 12) What about two way communications around pit stops? Please fix that and enhance so that when tyre wear is low the pit might ask how it is going? How about having multiple race stratregies amd an option to switch to plan C?Therew are many more wishes, but the above could all have been done with a little bit more work and they are not ground breaking either. All in all this is a genuine attempt at getting something new represented in the F1 world, but the price does not reflect the changes made, which are overall minor tweeks. Not all of them to my liking. Simply put, by going after a broader appeal Simulation fans have ended up loosing out again. That is frustrating to say the least. It feels shallower and the physics execution is more like TOCA then F1. I still can't feel the build up of downforce as the speed increasese, and I can't gain a tenth here and there by doing very carful car set-ups. I know that is not what thew majority seems to want, but then this is my review and they can write theirs. Dear Codmasters:Please rework the phsyics from scratch (car, damage, collision, the lot). Please give us more simulation options that make real differences on how the car feels, and bring us a propper career story line.Yours faithfully Chris (F1 simulation addict)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I started with F1 2010 on the xbox 360 and then F1 2012 on the 360 before finally making it to F1 2014 on the PC.Pros:- Runs at a solid 60+ fps 1080p while recording- Graphics appear to have become better since 2012 (although i was on console for that)- Learning curve is reasonable. You can pick up the game fairly easy and every couple of races you can turn up the difficulty a little bit or turn off some assists to get better.- You get to experience the new turbo F1 cars.Cons:- One major graphical error that bothers me to no end is that fact that when you are in the ""TV Pod"" camera mode as well as the driver's camera mode, the mirrors provide you with absolutely no information. The mirrors look like they came straight out of pole position. Legitemately, the reflection of cars in the side mirrors give you no benefit because pole position had better graphics detail and animation.- Home menu and submenus not necessarily the most intuitive- After exiting fullscreen through an Alt+Tab, the game cannot be put into fullscreen mode again without exiting game and launching game again (this may only be a problem for me but, I have to launch it using Nvidia Geforce Experience or it won't be fullscreen at all)- It's the same game as years prior (Coming from 2012 to 2014 and from console to PC, the only difference I notice is the graphics, the cars are supposed to feel completely different and be harder to drive with the new regulation changes, but I feel as though I'm still driving the 8 cylinder naturally aspirated F1 car with blown diffusers from 2010 and 2012.)Overall: If this is you first game in the F1 series, get it. If you already have a game but are looking for an updated version with an all new feel, don't. The game is a Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V of previous years. Unfortunately this is the Madden of racing games and I don't see the game changing this pattern in the near future.Graphics: 6/10Sound: 8/10New Features: 0/10Overall Quality for New Player: 7/10Overall Quality for Returning Player: 4/10			",51,7,5,9,9,1,9

												BUY 2013 INSTEAD!!!!As a huge fan an owner of F1 2010, F1 2011,  F1 2012 and  F1 2013 I have to say that this game is downright awful.- Rain raices are literally impossible   -> Seriously, spend 5 hours on finding a setup, and AI still is always 2 seconds faster   -> Spin out all the time, even with an analog controller and wheels/pedals. 1% Throttle = too much- Penalties are still ridiculous   -> AI crashes into you in a corner - you get a penalty- Annoying graphic bugs   -> Reflections in mirrors are lowest quality and have color issues   -> Rosbergs car (no. 6) behind you? Reflection shows Hamiltons car (no. 44)- Wheel support is lousy    -> Force feedback is horrible, unplayable with a Thrustmaster T500 RS- No updates since day 1, and none to come   -> Developers are lazy and refusing to fix this mess- AI still too stupid to pass you Bottom line: Stay away from this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥			",279,14,36,22,14,4,21

												Huge change in the cars from 2014. Which is understandable. It's nice to feel the lack of downforce and to hear the turbos implemented in this season. It's a total change from 2013 and rightly so. I'm thoroughly enjoying trying to keep the car on track. The lack of downforce on the cars is really noticeable. For example just running the track in Australia I can visually see and almost feel the car come off the track. I've yet to complete most of the tracks as the game has only been out a few hours. I did however give Sochi(Russian Grand Prix) a whirl and it was a welcome addition to the game. Like previous iterations in the series the game takes some getting used to but it is possible to master the game and become a E-Formula1 legend. With the aforementioned said. I do feel that my XBOX controller doesn't seem to have the same control as 2013 which threw me off just a bit. However I'm improvising, adapting, and overcoming this. I feel it's just me getting used to the new cars and changes in the sport. I miss the young driver test although the evaluation they have now isn't too bad. It just doesn't seem to place you on a team or let you pick from a few like before. I mean picking Mercedes AMG, Scuderria Ferrari, or Infinity Red Bull from the get go seems to easy. So instead I opted to drive for Sauber behind Bianchi (#JB17) as the number 2 drive. Which so far has proved quite the challenge I'm barely able to keep myself in 3rd place starting from 11th.Either way it's a great game and I'm looking forward to putting more time in. If you're into racing and like a challenge, with ever changing dynamics and gameplay F1 is the way to go.			",166,6,10,8,25,0,17

												I own a ASUS ROG G750JS Gaming laptop with a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 870M.  I also use a Logitech Driving Force GT from my PS3 games such as Gran Turismo.  The graphics I use is Ultra High which makes the gameplay realistic.  60 FPS is impressive but the heat coming out of the computer is pretty hot.  While on battery, I have to fall back to 40 FPS with graphics setting to High with a slight lesser heat coming out.  So far I ran six 100% distance races with only one DNF.  Though I don't own a desktop I really enjoy playing this game.I am a F1 fan, and I will play this game every day!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's ok, but I wouldn't advise you to get it if you are only going to play it once in a while.  The career mode is exactly the same bar some feature that shortens the season - who is going to use that?  Online at the moment is more laggy than it was last year, but I should imagine they will fix that.  Quick race, proving grounds and a pointless evaluation test are what it says on the tin.  It goes without saying that Codemasters are clearly focusing on their new 'engine' for 2015, however for 30 pounds i was expecting a little more than an update from 2013 which only adds 2 new tracks takes away classics and gives us the seasons cars, drivers etc.As a conclusion, I was expecting more from 2014, however my enjoyment from the game is still pleasing in my perspective.  2015 will be a decider if Codemasters can cut the mark on the 'next gen' games market and I am very much looking forward to the game coming out.

												SP is unplayable. AI is behaving so randomly, it's ridiculous. I reduced assists more and more, and am now at expert difficulty with Toro Rosso, it's always the same.Cars in front are impossible to keep up with during the race (doesn't matter if I'm 5th or 15th, my position just depends on the first few corners, with Toro Rosso it could be anything from 1st to 18th....). I probably use DRS once a race. But there's always one car in my 1s DRS window behind me. The cars behind me push ALL the time no matter what tyres, no matter how many laps they already have on the tyres, no matter how fast I'm actually going or what setup I have.They hop on the brakes at least 50m too early but suddenly have amazing grip and acceleration out of the corner. Again it doesn't matter what tyres/setup/car and so on.What a mess.Just to play with my X360 controller I had to switch to ""other controller"" or something... suddenly I had so much more control, I could turn difficulty up by two levels............

This is not one of them.Don't get me wrong. For those who play the series maybe it's ok.But after 18 times the same race (couse i wanted really bad to beat my rival) i managed to be 4th, last lap and out of nowhere, with zero speed, i got out of the way and turned over, that was the last thing i could stand.

												Αυτό που με απογοητεύει περισσότερο όλων με την Codemasters είναι η πεποίθηση ότι μπορεί να μας προσφέρει το αποτέλεσμα που επιζητούμε, αλλά εξακολουθεί να μην το κάνει. Δε μπορώ να πιστέψω ότι η εταιρεία που μας έδωσε κάποτε τα Colin McRae Rally games δεν είναι σε θέση να δημιουργήσει έναν σωστό Formula 1 τίτλο. Από την άλλη, αν το έχει γυρίσει τελείως στα arcade racing παιχνίδια και είναι ανίκανη να μελετήσει σοβαρά το πρωτάθλημα της F1 για μία χρονιά, φροντίζοντας να προικίσει το παιχνίδι της με τις αναγκαίες διορθώσεις, τότε καλά θα κάνει να αφήσει κάποια άλλη εταιρεία να αναλάβει το -δύσκολο αυτό- έργο. Δε ζητάμε να δημιουργήσει ξαφνικά το τέλειο F1 simulation game, άλλωστε κάτι τέτοιο όλοι γνωρίζουμε ότι σε ετήσιας κυκλοφορίας τίτλους θα ήταν καθαρή αυτοκτονία από εμπορικής άποψης, καθώς δε θα είχε λόγο να δουλέψει πάνω σε επόμενες εκδόσεις. Ας δείξει όμως ότι επιτέλους έχει την τάση να το κάνει. An unsatisfactory repetition of last year's game, F1 2014 cannot justify its release. The minor gameplay improvements are inadequate, compared to the various deficiencies, such as graphics and sound stagnation, lack of ERS system, absence of a special gaming mode like Champions or Classic mode of 2012 and 2013 respectively, problematic A.I and erratic penalty system.http://www.ragequit.gr/reviews/item/f1-2014-pc-review ",233,220,15,1,4,3,6

												I have f1 2013 & 2014.Both games are good and feel different. In 13 it's kind of more arcadish and somewhat harder to drive.  This allows more extreme manoeuvers and more adrenaline drive.In 14, if you make a mistake it's less punishing but harder to catch up. I think the game looks overall slower, maybe because the car is easier to control. The brakes are impressive. Everything sounds better, escpecialy the turbo. I think the sounds of the tyre at max grip when in turn are reduced though =(. Another downside is the online is not very popular in both games. You can switch your ""download region"" in steam. I guess it goes to servers in that location...  Cars jump due to lag in 14, looks weird, they remain invisible.I play with a xbox controller			",13,0,2,1,0,0,1

												This game is no where near as fun as the first one. I played it for 10 minutes before i couldnt stand it anymore. the car feels like it is perfectly attached to the road. it feels as if its on a rail or something and you have no clue as to the speed that you're traveling. F1 2013 had none of these problems. it allowed the players to feel as though they are one with the cars. and feel the sensation of speed. F1 2014 is not at this same level of quality. It feels like an unfinished game, that was rushed out early.			",45,1,1,3,11,0,8

												Ok this game is better than 13. I still think this game is better than 15 cause THAT GAME has alot of bugs. Like no VSC/SC The guy repeats himself like 13. Yes i am talking about the new f1 But anyway back to the F1 2014 review. I think chooseing any team at the start is cheating a bit but i fine with skiping those stupid tests. The gameplay is alright. I finished first on my first try. (I wasen`t trying) But the thing i like about this game is playing with friends. Who doesn`t want to race each other right?. What i think of this game is:Rating10/10			",24,3,8,2,5,1,0

												When buying this game, definitely consider the fact if you can meet the hardware requirements (recommended ones). The thing is, the game isn't smooth otherwise, which can really mess up your timing. I've been abusing flashbacks, but not because I am a noob, but because the handling was very imprecise due to the insufficient performance.Alright, after I lowered the resolution to 800x600 I got a smooth game performance... So I am now able to give a more detailed review.This is one of the easiest f1 games... But at the same time it's not exactly for total beginners. Because the difficulty is badly balanced... Actually so badly that on very easy difficulty you cannot win a single race, because all these driving assists slow the car down so much ( on Melbourne you need lap times of 1:38, but not even on your best try you can deliver better than 1:45 with full assists). and actually even hamper driving. For example I found 1.7 seconds instantly just by switching from full traction control to medium tc (never felt so forgiving medium tc btw).. Turning off abs made the car more responsive. But what is worse, in this game driving with no assists is just so easy! I own f1 2011 as well and turning off traction control there is pretty hard if you are a keyboard user.Well, that is the easiest difficulty. You need to learn to drive without most assists to be able to get competitive lap times. But then the difficulties progress pretty slowly. It's a nice game nevertheless, just not very challenging. If you seek a race challenge, go for either f1 2013 or f1 2016.			",67,24,3,19,6,0,13

												I have f1 2013 & 2014.Both games are good and feel different. In 13 it's kind of more arcadish and somewhat harder to drive.  This allows more extreme manoeuvers and more adrenaline drive.In 14, if you make a mistake it's less punishing but harder to catch up. I think the game looks overall slower, maybe because the car is easier to control. The brakes are impressive. Everything sounds better, escpecialy the turbo. I think the sounds of the tyre at max grip when in turn are reduced though =(. Another downside is the online is not very popular in both games. You can switch your ""download region"" in steam. I guess it goes to servers in that location...  Cars jump due to lag in 14, looks weird, they remain invisible.I play with a xbox controller			",13,0,2,1,0,0,1

												F1 2014 is actually really good!Pros- Smoother FPS.- More Shiny.- Better Handling.- Feels faster going through corners.- Choice in Career mode, you can now pick your own team.- Recommendations for AI (Driver Evaluation test)- More Assist options- Very good musicCons- Looks the same as F1 2013. (Duh! F1 2015 will have next gen and it will look fab.)- Tracks have the same graphics to F1 2013 (excluding Austria, Russia and Bahrain)-  Williams wheel and livery wrong (Livery is due to advertising alcohol)- Multiplayer hasn't improved, still huge amounts of lag when host leaves.Overall it is a good game!Mostly I find the Driver evaluation very useful as I can find the right difficulty for AI in career mode. (I'm on Legend)I also find that you can pick your starting team in Career mode as I can be Lewis Hamilton and start in the top team in my   first seasonI'd rate this game 9/10I have lowered it down because of the multiplayer not being improved, it’s been needing fixing for ages!

												Okay, in my view, which isn't always holistic and complete...to the point of 'never'!...up until this week I was looking forward to F1 2015, I watched all the E3 footage, analysed every reveal trailer including the 'features' trailer that had no features! and no career mode, no co-op mode and no extras!Codemasters reminded me of EA Sports when they released a 'bare-bones' version of FIFA onto the newly released Xbox 360 and got hammered for it! Well it looks like Codies have followed suit! The game does look beautiful, there is no denying that! But the 'new and shiny' label will soon wear off once people realise the ommissions!F1 2014 has no ommissions and it is a solid F1 racer. It does what it says on the tin! It doesn't make extravagant boasts or melodramatic claims of greatness...it sits you down, slaps you in the face and tells you how it is!I like that, no bells or whistles, and it's a great racing game! Graphics are still impressive on PC, framerate is solid at 60fps on my computer ( FX-9590, R9 290X, 16GB RAM)...AI is still a bit dodgy at times...the tyre wear bug is still rearing it's ugly head, but generally, this game is extremely enjoyable! I get tired and bored of the people who moan and ♥♥♥♥♥ about how unrealistic the game is...Codemasters are in a no win situation so they go with the common ground...a game that appeals to a wide variety of gamers! If you want nerdy, anally retentive realism then IRacing has you covered...to me games are an escape from reality, I certainly don't want them to simulate reality in any way!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Did a couple of laps on Interlagos, next to Spa, Monza and Hockenheim, one of my main tracks to test new racing games and steering wheel setups. Perhaps it is a placebo effect, but the handling and controls feel matured, closer to what I experience when I play a more sim oriented game like Game Stockcar Extreme. The track was pretty close, the car handled as I expected, and I was able to catch her in time to prevent spinning it where I expected to have to catch her and even when I didn't expect it she gave a split second warning that could be countered effectively.Yes, you can accuse Codemaster's of rehashing their engine ad nausea and simply pushing out a new F1 game every season, but they are refining their game. Each season looks better and with the odd exeption the handling is improving. The problem is that F1 2010 is still a very good game and if you don't care for the latest season there might be too little incentive to get the next game in line. Now I tend to wait for a good discount (pre-release or as with 2014 the first time I catch it on Steam).But if you are like me, well each installment has its value and I keep switching between games - 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 (classic content especially - from the 70-ies to the early 2000s) and now 2014.F1 2014 is a racing game that will do the job for most F1 fans and worth a spin if you are not.At a discount it is a no brainer if you like racing games on the sim side.

												Code Masters have done it again! I know a lot of people bash them but its Formula 1. If you love the high speed adrenaline pumping fun of racing down a track at 160mph+ then check F12014 out.  Ive been a follower of the franchise for many years.  If there was one down point to the game Code Masters you could issue an expansion each year for team rosters instead of issuing a new game.			",78,4,13,13,31,0,26

												I must unfortunately start this review with a criticism. It is, on the surface, a mod for F1 2013. However, once you scratch the surface it is suprisingly addictive. Leave aside the pad vs wheel debate and the autospin kerbs and the game is very, very good. Graphically it has taken a massive step forward since the start of the series in 2010, and the physics have improved no end, even though it may have been slighlty more dumbed down. Should you buy this game. Yes, but only if you don't have F1 2013 or you are hardcore.			",5,3,6,1,13,0,6

There could be a bit more story but I have wanted that with all sports games. They are just to small to compete with open world games. It can be done if they worked on it a little harder or a little longer! Really is a great game though! 9/10			",30,2,2,4,13,1,1

												This is a really fun game that I personally enjoy a lot as a Formula 1 fan.The game is almost flawless. The only glitches you will generally see in in the pitstops, where you sometimes drive through the other drivers. (Only during practice and qualifying) That is something that wasn't seen in the 2012 and 2013 version of the game.Worth the money, whenever you're a F1 fan or not.			",39,3,14,6,31,0,5

												This game is a great representation of the 2014 Formula One Season. I had some minor frame rate issues, but my computer is no gaming desktop. It can still run F1 2014 on medum at 60-70 fps. Apart from the teams changing a bit (oviosly) and new sponsors on the tracks, its basicly 2013 with 2014 cars. If you already have 2013, just wait for 2015 when it comes out. But if you don't, get this game in the meantime. 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
