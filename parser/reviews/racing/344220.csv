								Janky Tanky Fun!  Also, not a lot of 8 player mayhem local games out there.  This and Knight Squad have both been really fun!			",383,81,4,35,41,4,57

								Janky Tanks has a similar gameplay to Smash Bro's - do damage, knock people off. Higher damage = you fly farther!But with indestructable tanks!Played the demo, and wound up playing the demo for over an hour with a few people. Well worth the $2.50 I got on sale.For $5, I think I'd like to see a little bit more, maybe at least 1-2 more modes?Even still, lots of fun and I am keen to see how it develops further.  - Hot Tip: Set the water level to rise in 10 - seconds, and it becomes a king-of-the-hill panic for higher ground. It becomes more about how well you control your tank, as opposed to knocking others off!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								A fun mix of Smash Bros push mechanic and old PC tank games like Scorched Earth. A great game to play at a party.			",111,40,2,29,8,1,30
