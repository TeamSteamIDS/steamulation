												This is my first serious (mind the end) and public review on Steam.Basic InfosGameplay lengh: About 300-500 hours if you want to level high and see everything. 150 if you play through most content quickly.Required skill level: Experience with RPG games and knowledge in oldschool RPGs. Studing how the game mechanics work but also keeping a cool head for hours.Please note even if I'm merely clocking about 50 hours of it on Steam as of this review, I've already played through the game with the DRM-free version of it and it took me over a month of playing this game daily without any rushing through.Furthermore this review has been written considering the following essential mod, depending on how you see it. It is about as detrimental for the game as the game itself.- Gothic 3 Enhanced Edition Patch v1.75 International releaseIt is highly recommended that you install this patch before you play this game.There are a couple of other mods out there that enhance this game, like the ""Questpaket"" version 4.2, which has English subtitles available.About Gothic 3A lot of negative things can be said for a game like Gothic 3. It was released, as all releases of the Gothic series as a catastrophe. In 2006 at the time of release it was such a crash prone, bug ridden mess that almost nobody liked it, not even hardcore fans. Very similar to Gothic 1 it even was unbeatable because of the many bugs and problems. But since Piranha Bytes has a strong bond between them and the fanbase, they dicided to handle things over to the community. While some might argue that this is a rather lazy way of developing a game, a lot of others believe that the fans certainly knew for the best, sonsidering the unreasonably strict timeline publisher JoWood inflicted on Pyranha Bytes. After over 3 years of patching and care-taking, this game was finally able to become the greatness as envisioned by the developers but also the fans. It's considered the definite version of the game.You also don't need to play through Gothic 1 and 2 in order to understand this games backstory. However, it can answer a lot of questions regarding the world, the Hero himself and his way to handle prople. Still, if you take your time reading through hundreds of pages of dialogues alone you can quickly grasps what happened around you.Gameplay Gameplay-wise this game has the typical Hack and Slash action formula with the twist of also adding role playing elements in a different way as people knew already from previous Gothic games. Imagine a Game like Diablo with the freedom from games like Fallout but in third person, and you get what Gothic 3 is supposed to be. That might be the best way to describe this game.The main theme of this game can also be considered its main gameplay aspect, and that is the theme of freedom both in the storyline and gameplay-wise you'll find yourself in a world that doesn't explain much to you. Because of that you should properly always think about focusing your skills so you can live an easy life and Gothic typicaly this game is anything but easy.For instance and without spoilering of course there are quests in which the player has to defeat hundreds upon hundreds of enemies with the help of maybe one Non Player Character. Quests can range from simple ""Kill this Person or this Monster"" and fetch quests, to whole adventures based on exploration. Even non Gothic fans know about the infamous ""Where is the Guro?"" questline that only people who truely enjoy exploration found as it's entirely optional regarding the entire game itself and the reward is to travel throughout the game while finding interesting and secret things. This doesn't mean that this game is boring, as Hacking and Slashing is the main focus and leveling up itself offers so many options to choose from.To give a few examples, there are 39 spells to choose from, and there are 23 passive skills to learn just for doing physical attacks or to defend yourself and there are much more different skills ranging from smithing, to stealing from someones pocket. All of them need learning points and you get 10 of them with each level up and while this sounds simple it merely gives you free room so you tackle the immense hordes of hundreds of enemies in the middle game.The Gothic series is known to be very challenging and hardcore games and the third incarnation is no exception from this. Almost all of the several hundred Quests are available from the start of the game where the only true requirement is to find them if the player chooses to wander around looking for important ""named"" Non Player Characters. It has to be noted that this game is totally MASSIVE. Apart from MMORPGs, most single player games don't come close to this in scale. This can be intimidating for newcomers of the genre, as there is no fast travel or any form of help other than a compass. It takes about an hour to walk from the lower left to the upper right corner of the entire game. About 40 minutes if you choose to run (about twice as fast as walking) and wait for the stamina to replenish.As you can walk to almost every place right after the start of the game and due to the freedom of this game it's totally up to you on how to handle things entriely your own way. However, with this freedom a lot of mistakes are bound to happen. As the Hero shapens the way you can desire to choose whatever you want so it's recommended to always think about your next step, like what you would like to skill next or if you really want to follow a specific quest.I haven't yet tackeled the general setting, but thats just because that this game is focusing on hardcore hack and slash gameplay that even hundreds of quests aren't exactly this eye-catching. The premise goes like this, you either join up with either the Orcs or Humans and kill those who are in charge of this entire ordeal. As every NPC is killable right from the start it's up to you to kill EVERYONE or follow the rules as set up in the beginning of the game. This may sound simple on paper but believe me its far from it, as you need lots of carefully planning to archive the main goals of this game.Graphics and SoundGraphically this game was amongst the prettiest in 2006 and as it actually stood the test of time says a lot about its graphical fidelity. To be honest the grass landscape of Myrtana alone looks almost as good as Skyrims and considering the age and budget gap of both games I believe thats surely an achievement.In terms of sound however, this is one of the best games for the PC, ever. Seriously, if you even just enjoy good music you have to get this game right now. Kai Rozenkranz is a genius when it comes to creating atmospheric music that fits spot on into the game. However, there is one song that stands out negatively and thats the Battle music. It's always the same theme when you're fighting a usual enemy and after a few hundred hours this may get on your nerves. This is forgotten when the player finally reaches the city of Ishtar, where argueably the best music in the entire game plays and you'll find yourself again after spending hours upon hours of your free time into this game without noticing that it's dark outside already, in the real world of course. VerdictGothic 3 is a very ambitioned game and I believe that its too bad the project was cut short for release due to the old publisher. With the user created patches and mods mentioned above however I believe that this might be one of those games that will stay fun even after decades to come. I highly recommend everyone to buy this game when a Steamsale comes along if you're still not sure if this game might be of interest to you. If you think this game is interesting and you enjoy huge in scale RPGs with an oldschool soul, get this now.Recommended food while playingGerman Beer with Sausage and hot mustard			",464,62,12,51,40,3,65

												This is my all time favourite game. It's everything I love about RPG's - the freedom, the story, the impact you can make and the interactions with others (NPC's).But installing Comunity Patch is strongly advised, also modding might be interesting for some (more info on both can be found in the discussions).Pros:+ Great story line, that continues the adventures of our nameless hero from Gothic 1 and Gothic 2, but the game has dialogs for people who are not fammiliar with the first two games. If you meet someone  from the previous games, they will remember you, but you can ask them who tey are and usually with a whitty remark, they will remind you how you know them.+ It's an RPG, so you have your standart RPG elements:          * You do quests, kill monsters, gain experience, level up, earn learning points and use them to learn a bunch of skills, like Hunting, Blacksmithing, Thievery, Alchemy, Magic (Anchient knowledge).           * Each set of skills has it's own attributes, like Hunting has archery, improved archery and master archery. Learning points can also be used to increase your hitpoints, stamina or mana.          * Wide vierity of weapons, also magic can be used in combat.          * You can make your own weapons, potions and food.+ Fantastic soundtrack.+ Open world. You can go where ever you want and do what ever you want (be ware of consequenses, some monsters are strong as hell and will kick your beginer♥♥♥♥♥. + Three different lands with different climate, different people, different culture and seperate stories that in one way or another intertwine.+ You can beat up who ever you want (assuming you are skilled enough) and you can kill who ever you want (if you can beat them up or if you've learned Assasination).+ If you start a fight in a town that doesn't know you and isn't friendly, others will kick your♥♥♥♥♥(unless you can kick all of their ases :D ). Towns have rules - no fighting (unless you are well known :D)+ After you've beaten up someone and knocked them down, you can take their weapon and rob them.+ If you steal something in a town people will start to suspect you, You can try to talk your way out, but they might or might not fall for that. IF they see you stealing, be prepared to fight.+ If someone sees you killing someone in a town - be prepared to fight. If only one person saw you, you can kill him and get away with it, though others might suspect you're to blame, but just as with stealing, you can try to talk your way out of it. If a lot of people saw you, then you'll have to fight all the people in town.+ Friends will join your fights and will support you. If you fight a friend, however, others will cheer. :D+ You can pick sides. What will you choose. Who will you help. - it's up to you.+ There are a lot of quests and a lot of different mods.+ The moment you start a revolution...+ Open ending. The main story gives you a choice on how you'll end the game. And your choice along with your other actions and choices, will determan what future will look like.+ The game has one of the best gaming community and a Community Patch Team that has releaset the latest and final patch 1.75 that makes the game work and look a lot better. With the patch, you won't be able to tell that the game is so old. (More info on the patch can be found in discussions)+ The game has mods.+ The game has some surpises, like hidden diaries that tell a story no NPC knows.Cons:- Your decisions have consequences. This is a good thing, but it can actually ruin the game for you, if you did something and you don't know how it will impact the game. For example if you liberate too many towns before you do all the quests  for them, the town head will attack you and you'll loose dialogs and some quests.- It's a massive game and if you wan't to play it as best as you possibly can, you need to know a lot of stuff. This includes who to kill and who to spare and when, where to look for items etc.- Dialogs are important. This is nothing new and should be a norm, but sometimes gamers just like to skip dialogs and go kill beasts for no reason, but still get paid for it :D and in oh so many cases dialogs explain what and where you must do to finnish the quest, so skipping dialogs is unadwised. Luckily Quest log shows you the important parts of the dialog.- At times you will need google to help you with quests. There are quests that conterdict each other and you'll have to choose who's side will you take.- Some english voice acting is not the best. Other languages have it better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												With the Community Patch, Gothic 3 is one of the most ambitious, challenging, and varied RPGs that I've played. It is beautiful and engrossing. It blends the grittiness of Witcher with the scope of Skyrim and just doesn't quit. The character progression is superbly balanced. The map design is superlative and gets you excited to explore. I haven't seen better. You will die, and die, and die but it never feels unfair. This game is bizarrely underrated.			",73,19,2,18,9,1,4

												One of the greatest RPG I have played. Seeing many of the hideous comments about Gothic 3 made me not even want to play it. But, I gave it a chance. The Community Patch(http://www.g3cpt.eu/) is extremely needed, as it fixes many of the issues. I say, after 100s(almost there) of hours played, that this is amazing. The music, the background dialog, the quests and the storyline is what you will expect of the gothic series. It is extremely addictive and could eat your spare time easily. I can only say that everyone needs to give it a try.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had to kill the cows on the farm belonging to the orc city, and free the slaves in the camp nearby. I sniped 4 of the 5 cows and angered the farmers. So, I ran away to free the slaves. Ended up running back to the farmers, followed by the slavers, and then to the city, where the fight alerted the orcs. So, I then had the orcs, the farmers and the slavers all chasing me, and the last cow had disappeared. Who could blame it?So, I ran away into the woods, with the whole bunch following me, where they began fighting with the local wildlife. The woods were alive with the sounds of battle. Hiding, I stumbled across some grain thieves camped beside a cave filled with gigantic ants. The giant ants attacked everything, the grain theives attacked the orcs, the slavers and the orcs attacked the grain thieves, and in amongst it the wildlife had a go at whatever crossed its path.I sneaked away but ran into a pack of wolves and led them back to the ongoing epic confrontation in the woods via a bridge, whcih they then fell off one by one into a gully below. Some grain thieves arrived and I led them back across the bridge. They too failed to negotiate the bridge and fell into the gully with the wolves.I never did find the last cow.I suspect it fell out of the world with the shock of it all.13/10			",74,49,9,20,13,0,19

												The title has not been welcomed as warm as its younger brothers mostly because of its requirements which comparing to them is quite a hardware aimed shoot. The second thing which made the game a bit underrated is that it was forced to be released while it was just about halfway done so back then it was like 50% game and 50% bugs. Don't worry about these things any more because now with a flow of the time PC's get better and huge Gothic community took care about bugged game and they improved and refined it with a few patches and mods they made, successfully I have to say. Gothic 3 is now really enjoyable game but I am not finding it as challenging as G1 or G2 which might be advantage and a bit of defect but that depends on player.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gothic 3 is my great, white whale.I bought it when it first came, but gave up on it due to balance issues and frustration. Basically, Gothic 3 was another victim of a publisher (JoWood) forcing a developer (Pirahna Bytes) into puppy-milling out a game before it was ready for prime time. G3 lingered as that one game I wanted to play and finish to get closure on the series, but the infuration of playing it was not worth it.Until ...Over the years a Community Patch was created that fixed most of the nut-kicking issues. Folks said it was better once the patch was applied. So, I decided to take the plunge. I wasn't expecting stellar GOTY game play or awesome balance. I just wanted to grind through it to get the story and slay my great, white whale. Or, at the very least, come to terms with it over a nice cup of tea at the cafe while talking about old times.For the most part, the patch makes G3 better. Much better.But ... now we just get to the ""normal"" annoynaces that may put gamers off of it:* The Gothic universe is not for everyone. Dinosaurs are running around your savage, medival land. Factions and politics are abundant. Everyone cops an attitude with you (even your allies). It's not your prancy, elf-laden world of high-fantasy. It's like the Land of the Lost, The Lord of the Rings, Mobsters and the Elder Scrolls got together and had an illegitimate love-child.* There's obvious moral high/low ground, but it's up to you to decide how to go. Orcs hate humans (you're human), but you don't get auto-attacked in Orc towns. This may throw some folks for a loop when they first play, them pulling out a weapon to assault an Orc town without realizing you can just walk in and talk to folks instead. If you like to shoot first and ask questions later, Gothic may not be the series for you.* The story just picks up where G2 left off. And I'm not talking vanilla G2, I'm talking the Night of the Raven (?) add-on / expansion. If you've never played G1 or G2, you're going to be lost. There's bits and pieces of back-story thrown at you, but you'll still be lost. Even reading an overview online will leave you lost. You can play it as a stand-alone game / story, but you'll get reminders here and there that you're missing a part of the back-story.* Per Gothic's SOP, you start out as a wuss-bag, and slowly, desperately, try to claw your way up. Even with the patch's combat / AI balancing, combat is still a brutal affair. Every Gothic has been that way, so fair warning. However, G3 (pre-patch) was notorious for having low-level wolves gang-r@ping your high-level character with machine-gun-like lunge attacks en masse while a low-level character was able to use a polearm to easily dispatch high-level trolls. So... yes, the patch did balance combat ... a LOT. But, combat is still brutal. Upgrades to armor are majorly expensive. Upgrades to weapons come slowly. The skill progression system is a slow grind, having to spend points to raise skill levels just as points of entry to unlock actual skills you want. (EG: you have to spend skill points to learn an arbitrary level of alchemy skill to unlock your ability to learn to craft mana potions, or transformation potions, or permanant potions. Does a higher alchemy skill level help you? No. It just acts as a gate-keeper to unlock those skills. So, you'll feel like you wasted a lot of skill points raising skill levels that ultimately did nothing but act as gatekeepers.) You will have to very carefully pick-n-choose your combats, because you will get your rear handed to you over and over... even on easy mode!* Load times still suck a big one ... I'm not kidding. One reason I gave up G3 back when was because the load times from a HDD took like a minute or two! And saving took time, too. This is the kind of game you want to quick-save and reload, because you will bork things up time and again. Getting punished with a 2 minute reload time EVERY time you did somethign stupid or found out some wuss-creature was able to own you was just torture. If you have an SSD, then they are manageable, but still expect to wait 10-20 seconds.* Combat is still a tad glitchy post-patch. Making special note of this, because you will still find some animals that seem to lean back and magically avoid all of your attacks even though you see your stupid weapon going right through them. Then they lunge in and nail you. It's not as bad post-patch, but it still happens.* Quests are banal sometimes ... you will get the usual ""go here, kill this, fetch this, deliver that"" junk. But, you grind those for xp and levels. The real merit of the game is when you get to decide how to overall play it. Will you side with the humans or the orcs? Is it time to liberate a town? If so, how? (Will you side with some rebels to take it over, or go in solo?) Each move you make impacts your rating with factions, so if you liberate enough towns your rating with the orcs will go down and they will attack you on site going forward. Or, you can go wipe out those nasty rebels for the orcs.* Walking ... so ... much ... walking.  The game world is overly huge, and you'll get stuck aimlessly wandering about. It can be fun exploring, and they try to coax you into hitting the cities in a certain order. But, you can go and do whatever you want. They try to cordone off certain areas by putting harder monsters in your way, but you can run past them or jump up mountains to get around. You can go places you ""shouldn't"" early on as you please. You'll get your rear handed to you, but it can be fun. But, the game world is flipping huge, and trotting every where will waste hours of your time. Fortunately they put in teleporter stones you can carry to help you get from town to town faster, but you have to find the stone for each town. That can be tricky sometimes (especially when it's hidden in a place that's restricted until you win the town leader's favor). So, break out your walking shoes.Overall...Would I recommend G3? Yes, but only if you played G1 & ♥♥♥♥nd liked them.Would I recommend G3 without the Community Patch? No. Heck no. You have to go to a separate web-site to get the community patch, and once it's installed it's installed. And, if you already started a save game you'll need to restart the game (it invalidates pre-patch save games). So, install G3, install the Community Patch, then play the game. Don't even open or play G3 without the community path.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Gothic 3 scored only 8/10 because producer JoWood 'rushed out' production..."" that's a funny complaint because an 8/10 from any major critic is a heavenly blessing upon a game like Gothic 3. Nobody who plays any of the Gothic or Risen games is ever on the fence about them; you either love them or wish that you could set the developer on fire. Allow me to explain:I love Gothic 3. I come back to it over and over even though by now the graphics are seriously dated (I had originally reviewed the game many years ago and called it beautiful) and I have discovered pretty much everything in the world that there is to discover. There are hours upon hours of quests and content in the game to keep you busy and most of them are pretty easy to figure out. Rarely do you have to trek across an entire continent (like in some other open world RPG's out there) in order to pick up item x and then walk all the way back to drop it off. It happens... but it's rare. Allow me to first address the number one thing anybody will ever criticize about any Pirhana Bytes game: The combat SUCKS! Even after official and community patches it's still one of the worst combat systems I've ever experienced and without a doubt the worst in an RPG. Let me save you some frustration though: If you're fighting near a hill, ALWAYS make sure you're below the enemy; if you're fighting downhill you can't hit them for some reason. Trying to use any offensive spell other than fireball will most likely get you killed; don't invest any of your learning points into magic. In fact just use archery and you'll be a lot happier with combat once you get the better bows. If you do have to fight in melee, just mash the attack button. Never block, it's useless. If the enemy backs up out of range and you can't close the distance, stop attacking for a second and right when they're about to strike, spam attack again. Two handed weapons are super strong but while your character is powering up his swing, you will be murdered. With enough points in strenth a one handed sword can one-hit almost every enemy in the game.Like I said, combat is extremely unbalanced and poorly executed but once you get used to it, it's actually kind of funny. Near the very beginning of the game there is a literal army of orcs camped outside a castle and with very little training and the starting weapon I was able to single handedly kill every last one of them because for some reason they all wait for you to kill the guy you're attacking before another one attacks you. The only exception to that is with archers; they'll shoot you while you're fighting someone else.The world is huge and unfortunately either due to how old the game is or simply poor design choices (a common theme with Pirhana Bytes' games) the quick travel system is horrible. You have to first find teleporter stones to a town or (very rarely) another location and then use them like an item. A neat idea but it just doesn't work well. For one thing, the cities are in some cases so far apart that even if you use a teleporter stone you still have to walk for 20 minutes to where you're trying to go. Since enemies and items never respawn this gets pretty boring in the mid-game. But on the plus side there is a lot to see and discover in the world; obviously not as much as say, Oblivion, but it gets relatively close (it has absolutely nothing on Skyrim, though).As with all of the Gothic and Risen titles, the voice acting is a joke. In Gothic 3 this is compounded by the script also being a joke. I don't think it was given to a native English speaker for proofreading; if it was he just phoned it in that day. I would love to see a Gothic 3 movie that uses the actual game script. That would be comedy gold.There isn't a WIDE variety of weapons but there are plenty to keep you progressing. Unfortunately theyre's always one obvious choice that's better than what you have, no real reason to experiment with other weapons. For example: I have never used an axe or a quarterstaff. There's no point. That would be really annoying in any other RPG but since, as I mentioned above, combat was little more than an afterthought by the developers of this game... you don't really notice. You just buy the next better weapon so that you can kill faster.Magic system is broken and they never bothered to fix it, don't even waste your time. Some of the spells have such a long ""power-up"" (super saiyan) time that you'll be dead before you ever get to see what they do. Having fireball scrolls can be useful in a pinch but they do about the same damage as a strong bow unless you waste a bunch of learning points strengthening your magic (and ultimately losing the game unless you're fairly experienced).Speaking of learning points, in the Gothic games (and the first Risen) you level up differently than in other RPGs. You gain experience and gain a level like in other games but you don't get anything but learning points when this happens. You then have to find trainers to either increase attributes or teach you new skills. In the beginning of the game you level up super-fast but levelling eventually slows down and then stops so make sure you have a plan on where you want your character to go before you start spending learning points willy-nilly. I like this system, I just wish there were more levels in the game so that you could customize your character a bit more. You can really only MASTER one combat art which is why I say magic is useless... if there were more learning points available it'd be fun to play around with but it stunts your strength in melee or ranged combat.Reagents for potions never grow back like they do in, say, The Elder Scrolls. On the surface this seems wrong but the fact that there are potions you can make that permanently increase one of your attributes or skills shows you why they did this. If you could just keep making those over and over again there would be no need to ever spend learning points. There are plenty of reagents in the world to make more healing potions than you will ever need, anyway. Honestly come to think of it I don't think I've ever made a healing potion. You find a ton just by fighting and opening chests.I could go on forever. It's difficult to explain what makes Gothic 3 a good time because, especially as a new player, you will rage quit a few times. You will hear some dialogue exchanges that make you think ""why the hell am I playing this?"". You will notice some of the skills or crafting recipes never got finished (only 2 or 3) and if you spend money to learn them you basically just wasted your money. Quests will break and you'll have to load a save (and in a couple rare cases I've found, completely start the game over).But I love it.Maybe I'm a masochist.			",346,88,5,77,58,2,89

												If Piranha Bytes had another year to polish, add more content and work out the kinks Gothic 3 could of been one of the best video games EVER made. But instead, its just a really awesome game. Gothic 3 is definitely the best and most beautiful game in the series and a game that makes you feel allot of nostalgia when you play it. and when you are playing it you can't help but to often think that the game could of been epic level if the game was polished and had more main story quests. it is most definitely worth the low asking price on steam. a must play game if you are someone who can still love a game despite it's bugginess, anyone who has played a bethesda game knows what i'm talking about, bethesda's games are epic but buggy and so is Gothic 3.

												Yes it was terrible at the time of launch.But now many years later the community patch with alternative balance really makes the game great!Really good followup to the Gothic 1 and Gothic 2 games.Much more entertaining game than Skyrim, because the characters are so well made. Many many interesting quests and events. This game does not have same kind of ""dungeon grinding"" like many other rpg:s... and thus it is unique to the gothic series!Gothic 1 2 & 3 are great games, much better than Piranha Bytes later games: Risen™ game series.Gothic 3 is not a tunnelrun game, it is big open world where you can do many things.

												First I want to say that I am a huge fan of Gothic series.Where should I start? This game is just broken ; Bad combat system , really huge bugs , story is a little bit bad for other Gothic games BUT with the community patch this game is just awesome. They improved AI , many bugs were fixed and game is just ready. I have Gothic Universe and I've beaten the whole 3 games like 5 times maybe more but I'm still playing it. I don't know maybe the atmosphere is too good maybe I'm just being ""fanboy"" but this game is a total badass especially soundtracks are the best.Story: 7/10Gameplay: (with C.P)8/10Soundtracks:10/10Graphics:8/10 (still really good for an old game like this)   Make yourself useful Morra.

												While it's true that the Gothic games are riddled with bugs and other issues, there are some strong positives to games like Gothic 3.  For me, Gothic 3 has the strongest implementations of an open world fantasy environment for its time.  Sure, games like Skyrim do this better but Gothic 3 has to be viewed in the context of when it was released.  Gothic 3 came out in 2006, the same year as Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion (Skyrim was released 5 years later).  In comparison to Oblivion, it has a larger open world that feels lush, diverse, and interesting, whereas Oblivion's environments often felt cut/paste replicated to me.  Sure, Gothic 3 has some serious issues when it comes to things like the combat system, the variety of the quests, bugs, etc. but it shouldn't be written off completely.  It's simply not as bad as some people have said.  There's a lot of good here and if you love open world RPGs and I strongly feel this game has been overlooked.			",54,25,0,13,5,0,8

												An underrated gem. With the community patch, this buggy and broken game becomes slightly less buggy and broken to the point where the strength of it's other elements is able to shine.Namely, a massive open, explorable world with a variety of towns, locales and the ability to make choices with consequences ingrained into the game mechanics in a way which makes sense for the story. The writing is somewhat bland, but the freedom is stellar and the soundtrack is breathtaking (if small).Gud gaem. Not a polished AAA production by any means, but better than it's given credit for.

												This review is for the game with the community patch applied.I have played 100+ hours without Steam.Gameplay:This game can be compared to Skyrim. It has quests, from killing wolves to finding underground agents.Some people say the fighting is bad and that it's too easy, but it's actually good when fighting dozens of enemies at once because you stand a chance.Story and quests:You arrive on a land named Myrthana. It was conquered by the orcs and humans still try to recapture their cities. There are 3 paths: You can either side with the humans and try to take back the kingdom, side with the orcs and your friend Xardas and set on a secret mission (I won't spoil it,  but it's really interesting) or you can choose to destroy everyone, but this is a path I haven't tried myself. The game has a complex reputation system which shows what different factions think about you. You will eventually have to travel to Varant (a desert land) to complete your secret mission or to Nordmar (an Icy continent) to help the humans. You can travel to both continents and do the quests there without following any path.Sound: In my opinion, the soundtrack is very good, but the orcs make a weird and repetitive sound when you hit them. (AAH, AAH, AAAAH)Graphics:The graphics are good for a game of its time. Install the community patch and the game won't lag.Gameplay: 9/10Story: 9/10Sound: 9/10Graphics: 9/10Total: 9/10			",63,5,0,11,9,0,12

												Casual gamer here. I played Gothic 3 the same time Oblivion was released. My motive for trying/buying it again was purely that it was on sale and decided to give it another crack (and that i had lost my previous CD). I thought i might choose another way to end the game (3 different yet similar endings). For those who seek a game of exploration and 'liberation' of cities without loading everytime you enter into a door, this could be the game for you (1 time game loading). The bad.- Story is predictable with same generic quests- Combat gets repetitive, left click the mouse and let the monsters just die- Characters look like tomb raider 1The good.- HUGE WORLD with a lot places to go and explore... some being quests others just having some epic loot- Day and night cycles, when NPC's go to sleep and move around- Music is actually very good.Before playing install the Community patch and remember that a boar can kill you >.<Thanks for reading!

												I don't know how I missed this title when it came out in 2006.This is a gem.  It's an old school fantasy RPG that doesn't do a ton of hand holding and is difficult enough that you actually feel like you've achieved something.It's a large non-linear world that rewards exploration and has quests involving slaughtering entire towns--towns full of fleshed out NPC's that have been giving you quests, etc.For a 2006 game, the graphics have held up well, and are something along the lines of the first Witcher or Morrowind.It has some quirks, like a quest to forge the most powerful weapon in the world resulting in something about half as effective as the standard weapon carried by every orc--but if you step back from trying to power game and just enjoy the world and what you're doing to change it--and you have choice about how you want to change it--it is fun.I've really enjoyed it more than any of the Witcher or Elder Scrolls games.Tonight I was killing off a town that I had decided needed to be killed off.  I was using a pole arm as I was fighting 50+ opponents at once, and the reach helps with defense in that case while side swipes can hit 4-5 opponents in front of you.  I had taken up a position in a doorway so I couldn't be flanked, and the dead were piling up in front of me, and I started to get the feeling I was being buried underneath the dead.  I paused the game to figure out what was causing that impression, and discovered, there were around 15 corpses in front of me trying to fall down, but they couldn't because I and the walls around me blocked them on the front and the waves of enemies behind them blocked them from the back. So neither I nor my live opponents could reach each other through the corpses pressed too tightly between us to fall.Corpse physics that affects combat.  In a 2006 game.  Not something I'd heard anyone even mention about the game--just one of those little details you notice playing it. ",7,5,0,16,3,0,9

												Gothic 3 is a 2006 open world action RPG game developed by Piranha Bytes, more known with their more recent series, Risen, is an (understadably) overlooked, underappreciated RPG gem, First thing first, I want to clear up some things:  1) I'm using the Community Patch 1.75 mod, also known as the ""Enhanced Edition"", without it, it's a definite thumbs down, it's a buggy, unplayable mess. A pure trainwreck.2) I've never played Gothic 1 & 2, which I heard is better than Gothic 3 + the latest patch. Better story, mechanic, especially Gothic 2, I'd definitely love to play G2 some day.3) I've played 30 hours or so, Steam doesn't detect my custom launcher. With that said, let's get straight to the review.Brutally Immersive Gothic 3 is a game that achieves the immersion through its grounded, and ""realistic"" world. You are a random nobody, and the game, its world, its people, its entire mechanic treat you like such. You are not a ""chosen one"" or a ""child of prophecy"", you don't have any special power that grants you an immediate advantage to other people, just a guy passing by, doing  whatever he could to survive. If you are expecting a power fantasy where you could bulldoze everything in front of you, you should back off. You need to project yourself into the game. Like when you see a pack of wolf, and you are in low level, with low grade equipments, you'll extremely likely to be killed off right away, even in higher level with better equipment, they're still rather intimidating. As for the combat. It works, for the most part. Let's stick to the positive part first. It term of mechanic it flows smoothly. The combat is much slower than other action RPGs. It's not only about who has the best equipment, it's more on how you make every block, movement, and attacks counts, mix and match the weapon and armor in order to suit your playstyle, and learning their advantages and disadvantages. Gothic 3 have an interesting quest system. All the quests are already active from the very start, but it's just remain hidden until you know it. Finest early example is the quest where you have to kill a pack of wolf near the first town. You can kill them first without knowing that its a quest, go to the quest giver, and he'll be pleased that you already kill it when he ask you about it. And if you not then, you'll be given that quest, and it appeared in your journal, and there is no quest marker or anything. You are just told that there is a pack of wolf somewhere outside of the town and it's your job to find them, it applies to all quest,  Gameplay Is Worldbuilding The combat and quest mechanic that I mention above is a bold statement that the world of Gothic is filled with dangerous creatures and sillful warriors, and you're not a special snowflake, and for me that is Gothic's biggest strength, ""show, don't tell"". Aside of that there are these little details, that while individually seems insignificant but when it combines, it contributes a lot to my fascination of this game like the no respawn mechanic, everyone/thing stays dead, you (and enemies) can choosee to kill or spare the enemies, guards don't like seeing you in a fighting stance and a house owner will watch you if they notice you entering their house, and yes, you can enter any house given that you have the key and skills, without a single loading screen! One aspect that I want to touch here is the enemy level scaling system. The system that Gothic 3 use isn't special or anything, but its some kind of a lost design choice when it comes to action RPG especially AAA ones, and that is enemy that didn't scalle along with your level. It might seem like a tiny thing, but it actually helps with the enviromental storytelling, you feel the tension and danger when you come to a high level area, you can't get an ultra-awesome anceint weapon early on, you have to work hard for it, it's a high risk high reward system. A perfect balance between freedom and subtle storytelling.Because of the things that I mention above: Enemies don't  respawn, you need to go to a trainer to level up (at least that's one way to do it) and that really makes you to really plan out your character build because you won't be a level 80 OP hybrid mage-swordsman-thief character at the end of the game. The skill system is built around realism, there is no skill that grants you an obvious superhuman abilities, it only makes you better at what you are doing. The Color of Chaos  The land of Myrtana is a colorful, vibrant, calming, albeit a bit generic medieval fantasy landscape, contrasting a dark storyline within it. Gothic 3's story is more grounded and ""believable"", its about a revolution of humans against the conquering orcs, and Gothic 3 is more focused on learning the politc, view and lore of each factions. The contrasting visual works beautifully with the context of the story, balancing the dark nature of the story and the calming and breathtaking long trips in between, and also it did a fine job to cover its otherwise average at best textures and models. Myrtana is divided into 3 different regions: The plains, desert, and snowy area, with their own unique creatures, ""cultures"", and architectures, making it much more than a change of landscape. There is no fast travel, or at least it is really well hidden, so you have to travel for minutes to hours even, if you want to travel to a major city, but man was it doesn't bore me at all, accompanied with awesome soundtracks, ambient tracks, and beautiful landscape, also a lively land where lore and quests awaits you if you want to explore.Talking about the soundtrack, it''s a 2 hours of worth of amazing soundtracks. Every major place and event has its own soundtracks that  really help to strengthen the overall feeling, coupled with a really  nice ambient sounds. And for the story, you can choose to side with the orcs, rebels, minor factions, independent, or work for everyone, each with their own distinct questline, and lead to different events and conclusions, with their own advantages and disadvantages, and it's always interesting to see each of their views and ideas, and that's a sign of well made RPG, I'll leave it at that. A Rough Diamond  Even with the  patch, that basically salvage a trainwreck, make it fully functional, and giving it fresh coat of paint. It's still not all sunshine and rainbows. Some of it is due to design flaws, terrible production value, and well.. the patch, as great as it might be can't hide the fact that it's an unfinished and unpolished game.Below average models and textures, bad to mediocre voice acting, somewhat ""rigid"" animation, below average dialogue translation, and an underwhelming sound and visual effects. The voice acting and dialogue, when combined together can create a laughably bad moments, that really hurts the otherwise great storoyline. Sound and visual effect doesn't pack enough punch when it hits the enemy, sometimes I feel like that I'm swinging  a toy sword.Some gameplay mechanic that I found kinda irritating is that you can't pick up enemy's armor, even if they are humans, and that you, at times is given too little information on what you should do on a given quest. Also, I'd love to see more variety of weapons and armors. Conclusion  Gothic 3 is a really great game if you have a keen eyes of the little things, if you interested to the details, and have the patience to discover it, and even greater patience to go through the obivously low  production value and the cracks it shows even with the patch. It's no power fantasy, and so don't expect it to holds your hand, at the same time, it's a highly rewarding game, there is no better feeling of overcoming a seemingly impossible battle and turn the tide. Gothic 3 is all about a high stake high reward exploration, discovery, choice, and consequences. And when I look at it, it is, in a way, is a game ahead of its time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Largely underappreciated upon its original release, mainly 'cause of bad rep it got from bugs and poor optimalisation, it was actually an unpolished gem ahead of its time. Right now, with Community Patches (that are available in the Steam release), you can experience it how it should be in the first place, give it the love it didn't get when it first appeared. And it's a marvel that didn't really age.			",179,20,4,25,25,0,40

												If Piranha Bytes had another year to polish, add more content and work out the kinks Gothic 3 could of been one of the best video games EVER made. But instead, its just a really awesome game. Gothic 3 is definitely the best and most beautiful game in the series and a game that makes you feel allot of nostalgia when you play it. and when you are playing it you can't help but to often think that the game could of been epic level if the game was polished and had more main story quests. it is most definitely worth the low asking price on steam. a must play game if you are someone who can still love a game despite it's bugginess, anyone who has played a bethesda game knows what i'm talking about, bethesda's games are epic but buggy and so is Gothic 3.

												One of my favourites of all time for more than a decade! Great open world exploration, epic loot and tons of quests will keep you busy for weeks or even months, depending on  your pace. Don't worry to much about the controls in the early game, it is getting better as you level up and improve your skills. With the outstanding work that has been done with the community patch, this game is now playable as it was supposed to be. An engaging storyline provides room for personal decisions, the characters are tough, rough and being so rather amusing. Wenn ihr Deutsch versteht, dann könnt ihr auch mit Community Patch auf Deutsch umschalten, bzw. die deutsche Tonspur runterladen über die Prefs in eurer Library-Liste auf Steam. Sehr empfehlenswert, weil nur auf Deutsch ungefiltert geflucht wird. Göttlich!			",55,16,0,13,16,0,6

												What you need:First of all you need to download the latest community patch (i think it's 1.7.5) otherwise the game will crash (Where is the Guru? error) and the mobs will simply one-shot you. Unfortunately the game was forcedly released before is was complete so the base version is full of bugs.After you have installed both the game and the CP you can play.G1 G2 comparison:Differs from Gothic 1 and Gothic 2, you still play as the nameless hero but:No chapters. You have a few main quest to complete. There are 6 reputation in the game and you have to choose who you want to support. There are 3 different way you can end the game based on your decisions.Attributes: Strength, Mana, Dexterity, HP (no longer increase with lvl up, you can raise them by using ability points), Stamina (NEW, for combat and sprint) Ancient Knowledge (NEW, for magic), Thief skill (NEW), Smith skill (NEW),  Alchemy (NEW).The ability points can now be spent in talents. In order to learn a talent you need a specific amount of points in its attribute (ex: 1h sword II req. 150 str. ex: crafting mana pots req. 20 alchemy).The combat mechanics is completly different. You can now dual wield 1h swords or using 1h sword and a shield. There are different attack types (it's not just left click spam all game long, unless you play on ""very easy"")  but the main difference is that you now have a stamina bar. If you are low on stamina your attaks will be slower, you can't parry/block properly, you can't perform some power attack,  you can't sprint.Final Judge:Even if the G2 NotR storyline is the best by far, in terms of pure gameplay i thinks G3 is better thanks to the new talents system. The map is really huge and filled with secret areas.There are a lots of different quests and even an easter-egg like the G1's. A single play can last 100h+ (i'm at 64h doing less than 2/3 of the map). The interface is more user friendly, you have a 10 item slot bar where you can put weapons, foods, magics and bind them with hotkeys (1->0). Now you can cook/craft huge quantity with just one click (it ask how many instead of left clicking on the fire 50 times) and also loot easly with the ""pick all"" button (or rightclick on corpes with CP). Pots and foods now restore a % of you max health/mana instead of a flat number.Game Mode:With the CP you can choose 2 different play style. The base mode and the advanced mode. The advanced mode rebalances the talent trees, so it's harder (probably impossible) to build a balanced hero that can do everything by unlocking all the talents.I played as:- 1h sword + shield warrior, both easy and boring since you can win any 1v1 duel but it's really hard when you're surrounded by enemies and so you have to do some cheesy pull to avoid that.- mage, really funny. A bit hard in the beginning since you have to hit and run to regen you mana pool and the staffs deal less dmg than swords (obv.) but when you've learned the mana reg. talent and you have a decent mana pool it's really enjoyable. It's not broken as the G2 mage that one-shots anything or deals no dmg at all.Others:I know there are mods but i never tried them.Good SoundtrackTips:I do not recommend the highest difficulty for your first run since you need to learn the combat system first. If you really want to start with the hard mode, just save after the inizial cutscene becouse you're going to die a lot of times :PSince the decisions you make can really impact the game, if you want to do the most quest possibile don't rush things, just talk with every one and accept as many quest as you can. Even if killing everyone is fun it may have bad consequence on your game plan.You can open the inventory during a fight and the game just pause. So you can regen your hp by drinking pots or eating foods without getting attacked.

												Strengths:•	Immense world to explore;•	Beautiful vistas as every location has its purpose;•	Nonlinear – do it your own way;•	Freedom of creating any character you desire.Weaknesses:•	Quests tends to be repetitive;•	Quests logs / maps needs a lot of improvement;•	Brutal system requirements;•	World not as ‘alive’ as in Gothic 1 and 2;•	Buggy state if not using the community patch (1.75).To those who haven’t played any of the Gothic games, you are missing out on a RPG treat – a vast and open world where abundance of exploration filled with non-player characters (NPCs) doing their own things thus making the Gothic series a living and breathing world. Filled with quests galore, its only mishaps is the combat system and extremely high system requirements. The journey now continues with Gothic 3 that improves some of the mishaps from the previous two however added a few more. That’s not to say to ride is game off as the world is massive, filled with some of the most gorgeous vistas I have ever seen in a long while thus making it an explorer’s heaven to boot.Because of the massive open ended world, to complete the game wholly depends upon what you do. If you are aiming just to finish of the main quest, then don’t play this. This game is designed to be explored from top to bottom and from left to right. It’s a huge world with plenty of things to discover and accomplish. The unfortunate thing is that some quests tends to be repetitive (there’s so much that I can take when ask to defeat so-and-so during those arena quests) however don’t let that deter you. So if you are planning to complete this game the way it’s designed, it can take easily close to 100 hours. For me, at the time of this review recorded close to 120 hours and I still got a quarter of the map to discover and then revisit  the world again to finish off the main quest line.Granted at the time of release, the game was a buggy mess. Maybe the dispute between publisher JoWood and developer Piranha Bytes have something to do with this. Piranha Bytes ‘left’ the game with version 1.12 (still in a buggy state) however the community, yet again, saved the day. April 2012 saw the latest version 1.75. It’s a sad state of affairs though as if the game ended at version 1.12, we will never get to see the game in its fullest glory. Version 1.75 still have minor issues however, and thankfully so, we get the see the game for what it was meant to be. An ambitious game in term of size however the world, whilst beautiful to explore, it still felt not as ‘alive’ as in Gothic 2. A definite explorer’s paradise to boot though.7.5 / 10 (basing on community patch 1.75 – without it, it will be a dismal 4).Full review: http://www.gamespot.com/gothic-3/user-reviews/2200-12684943/ ",729,440,34,169,129,5,186

												The greatest adventure you will ever encounter in a game. If you make it through the first 5 minutes of the game that are not that tempting, you will be highly rewarded for the rest of the gameplay.The game can take between 100 to 200 hours to finish.			",25,1,0,9,4,0,7

												This isn't a popular opinion, but I think the Community Patch makes this the best game in the Gothic series. The end game kind of breaks down, but the journey is incredible. The cold, war-torn world of Myrtana is brutally indifferent in every way, and merit is the sole determiner of success in this harsh landscape.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Gothic 3 or How to hate boars and earn a spheksophobiaI played Gothic 3 for first time back in 2007 and had unforgetable experience. I managed to buy it and play again and here is what I can tell you about it:So, first of all, if you didn't play that game before and want to try, then  YOU ARE NOT PREPARED!!!!!  be ready to get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked in first few seconds after the game begins. If u managed to survive and kick that orcs freaking out from the Ardea , congratulations, your journey has begun!Here are main skills that you will learn during gameplay:How to save your game after every fight (even with one enemy), opened chest, gathered plant, etc.How to google the passage of that f***ing questHow to google how to get enough reputationHow to google EVERYTHING for this game!How to ragequit (well this one is easy to learn in many other games)How to FINALLY KILL THAT WILD BOAR!!!And many other useful skills...Now for those who want to know something more about this game, Gothic 3 is:When you get a strong punch right in your face, go to the  REALTIME  inventory, eat food, drink potions while your enemy is looking at you, expose back your blade and continue fighting.When hornet stings you and you cry like a b*tch because you used your last antidote few seconds before to prevent your death from another hornet's poisonous sting.When wild boar is the strongest enemy in the game because it spams you with blows faster than any anime character.When you kill random guy and complete some quests which you haven't taken before and don't even know about.When you don't know how to use a shield until one dude (for a lot of money and exp. points) tells you: ""Take that sword in the one hand and that shield it the other"".When one lazy fat orc can't find rebels and tells you to do that (rebel's camp is in 25 meter away from him)When you can kill every single NPC in the game  Except maybe Xardass  and still finish it.When for crafting flaming arrows you need schnapps (and not only for arrows).When nearly each NPC uses two or more voices (especially in Russian localisation).When you don't know where to go and what to do 24/7.When you smoke marijuana (it's called Black Robar here) to restore mana and vitality (DO NOT TRY AT HOME!!!!!)When i'm tired of writing more about Gothic just try it by yourself.So, what can I tell about this game (yeah, i know, FINALLY):+ Open world (where everyone wants and will kick your♥♥♥♥♥+ Tonn of quests (which you will never complete)+ Not so bad game graphic even for 2017 (if you ofc. don't compare it with top modern games)+ Nice music+ Different fractions (there are 6 fractions in two groups that are in war. Orcs, assassins / Rebels, nomads, wanderers, Nordmar guys)+ Every NPC doing their own business (smoking, eating, working, wondering, sleeping at night, guarding, etc.)+/- Combat system (well this one is good only for me I guess, cos it's really painful and broken)+/- Fraction reputation (It's true pain. A lot of quests intersect one another and to get that reputation as a reward you have to make choises : ruin one quests to complete other. It's sometimes interesting, but to get enough rep. you will need to abandon too many quests in some zones. For example:  to get to the Ishtar (Assassin's leader's palace) you'll need to kill some of your friends or just forget about this zone with all it's quests if you don't want to murder them FeelsBadMan.)- Optimisation (well it just sucks. Like you vs those freaking wild boars)- Quest errors, NPS errors and more (no comment)Well, I may forget something, but these are main.All in all if you want to feel some pain, get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked 1000+ times, ruins quests, google whole Gothic, avenge me or any other G3 player and kill those boars, orcs and hornets, steal everything from everyone, shot 20 arrows into the orc's head and kill him only by 21st, drink schnapps and make a history of Mirtana, Varant and Nordmar, this game is for you.10 ""HOLD YOUR PLACE, MORRA!!""/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For a game i paid 2 Euroes for, it has deffiently been worth it.... however...I am curently 35 hours into the game, and thats alot of gametime for 2 Euroes. But even with the community patch, the game is buggy, the factions are horrible, you side with someone by accident and all of a sudden you cant do quests in your questlog, expect it to be cluttered up and confusing to look at.now i kind of ruined my character by sidding with a wrong faction, and even though I read that if i diddent liberate more than 3 cities i would still be able to do the faction quests, appaently excavations sites with orcs on, counts as hashasin citys, and all of a sudden i cant enter any of their cities without beeing attacked, and that sucks horribly, because the only place i can get a tallent that i need, is in one of their cities, so atm im not sure if i either should restart, quit or go a difrent route. since this is a review, i would say it gets 5 out of 10 stars, for the price, i got alot of good play time, but it is very buggy, and 1 piece of advice should be written LARGELY on the intro screen, DONT LIBERATE ANY CITIES UNTIL YOUR FINISHED WITH THE ENTIRE ""ZONE""			",21,8,0,5,9,0,2

												This has got to be my favorite of the series released so far.  It's the original Piranha Bytes and not Jowood's repurposed attached naming Arcania, nor their butchered works of Gothic 3 Forsaken Gods.  Most would prefer of the series the Gothic 2 as their favorite, but I prefer Gothic 3 for its community patches, content packs, and revised combat system, that makes use of button combinations for different attacks, of parry, reposte, slash, poke, and kill shots, as well, for a game that came out nearly a decade ago, it can still push a system, due to its complete open world nature, and openGL based engine.  For that reason, I still use it for testing systems max volume decibel level on fans of gpus.  This game has gotten better with age, and it shows with special thanks to an active community of content refiners.  I look forward to and have high hopes of the return to Myrtania in the next true Gothic named sequel with Piranha Bytes at the helm again.  This series holds a special place in my heart, and the soundtrack is masterfully written, and captures the scale and variety of locales.  With a lot of voice acting, multiple ways to play, and freedom to go wherever you wish, this game has managed to keep me occupied full of episodic gameplay that I can pick up and put down whenever I like.  This is truly a game I would love to see how much better it could look, if it got a remastering or High resolution facelift as it would still be worth buying for the 6th time.  If you like action rpgs that give you the ability to be in 3rd person, 3\4 view, and first person view with a plethora of myth and lore to boot, you owe it to yourself to give this game, and franchise a try.

												When I first bought this game my expectations for this game wasn't very high as I have never played any of the gothic games in my life but needless to say this game has done a fine job at passing my expectation, first thing I'm going to say this game is hard, very hard, the combat in this game takes actual skill if you try to spam your way through battles it will only get you killed, each enemy in the game has its own pattern so you must time your attacks very carefully and some enemies can't be blocked all together so you have to use footwork in order to fight which is very hard when you have a pack of sabertooths nawing at your groin.The general feel and atmosphere of this game is amazing I some times forget that this game was made in 06 because of how beautiful the game looks, this game has to have one of the best soundtracks (in my opinion) especially the music for the cities, I some times head to a city to finish a quest and forget because of how amazing the music is.Not to mention this game does not hold your hand unlike certen games *cough* *cough* Skyrim *cough* *cough* quest marker? nope, fast travel from the start of the game?, forget about it. All you are given is a compass a map and your own intelligence on where to head which I think is a good thing it gives the world a extra layer and makes you take in your surroundings.If you can I would recommend getting this game it's awesome sauce			",166,7,1,17,10,1,8

												First off I would like to say, even though my time says I have only played 30 hours. That is when I got it on steam. I actually got the game on a CD first(saddly the CD broke and lost all my saves >.<), and I've clocked well over 60 hours on that. I don't know my exact time but i've seen and played a lot of this game. Much like the Gothic series, this games boasts a HUGE landscape to explore. Even if you look on the top world view(main map) That is about half the map as their is a whole other level to the game, the amount of caves and tunnel you have to explore is huge as well. The areas you have to explore are beautiful and some scenes you can just stand there watching it for awhile. The map is huge for a game that doesn't give your a great fast-travel system, but that is the fun of an open world game, them forcing you to explore.This game, is unfinished though, even the developers came out saying that the people who put them up to it, rushed the game to be released long before it was ready. So you will find caves that are completely empty, pockets of pitch blackness even with a torch. Grass and trees that don't match the landscape. Even some areas that are just empty of anything. Anyone who has played through and explored the map has seen this, it does mark the game as not completed. Now, if they had completed the game, it might have been THE best game of that time, but, who knows, they never did.Comabt wise, the game is very simplistic, it goes on a 'duel' system, so you'll rarely have 2 or more people gang up on you, so it is mostly 1v1, even if you are surrounded by an army. Your moves consist of the same thing and it's very easy to kill the enemies. Saying that though, any archers or magic users are not afraid to cast their spells at you, even when your already fighting someone, and spells in this game are VERY unforgiving, some even doing a 1 or 2 hit on you. What makes this game all the harder, is that there is no auto-save feature. So you will have to manually save. It's smart to save every time you enter and leave a town, this game will make you a spastic saver. Getting killed with a sword or axe though, is just as easy, as the computer gets the exact same attack patterns you do, and if your not careful, you can be quickly killed off. (Basicly, once they start a combo and you can't break it, your dead.). Archery works fantasic and forces you to aim and be accurate, shields actually do their job, I.E. stopping arrows from hurting you and magic... magic is a ♥♥♥♥♥ sometimes. Overall, the combat is wonky and unforgiving sometimes, but workable.The quests, although quite simple at times, range wide, towns usually consist in the same but you'll find that the game does follow the progress so, killing off an orc town, well, that means going into any other orc towns wont be easy. This game also has quest that spans the continants. For instance, one quest, for you to get a boat skimatic, which is roughly the middle of hte map, well, to get said skimatic you have to go to the south, into the varrent, a desert, well, sorry, the guy wants ice wolf pelts, and those, can only be found in the north in nordmar. The game makes you travel to this fantastic areas to grab something, it is truely amazing the amount of work was put into this game that wasn't even finish.This game lacks polish, that is evident in the fact they got rushed to release it, I don't blame the dev's for that, you can only do so much in a certain amount of time and your not allowed to push over. If you can look past it's flaws the game is great, the story is lacking somewhat and isn't that straight forward, but, it makes you take your time and explore.  Overall, it is a good game for those who don't mind the lack of polish and the sometimes wonky gameplay. I've loved playing it and I think many others will too.Quick tip to anyone wanting to get this. Focus on leveling up and getting lots of quests done before truely picking a side. You'll get twice the amount of quests.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Honestly, it killed the genre for me when I got it in 2006. There's nothing ""gothic"" about it, except that you're still playing as the nameless hero, and old friends make small cameos. The combat is clunky, the animations suck, it lags alot (even if your computer is amazing). The story is non-existent; you start off looking for Lester, which is fine with me, if I actually found him within the first 2 hours of gameplay. The story revolves around nothing: either liberating cities from orcs, or destroying rebel camps. Same thing happens in the desert region: liberating cities from the hassashin, or destroying the nomads. The only part with an actual story is when you venture into the cold mountains of Nordmar. And for an ending, there is no epic bossfight, or talk with the main characters. You get 3 ""mass effect 3"" endings, depending on what god you choose to follow. The most offensive part, to me, was the interaction between the hero and Xardas. As someone who grew up with the Gothic Series, Xardas is one of the most interesting characters I have ever seen. He walks a blurred line between anti-hero and villain, by using the nameless hero for his own nefarious purposes. I won't spoil what exactly he does, but his role in Gothic 3 is awful. There is a 6 hour goose-chase through the myrtanian continent to find Xardas, and when you finally find him, all he does is give the hero some pointless information. This happens to every character, with a few exceptions. Diego, the master thief and cunning rogue, turned into a laughable traveling mercinary. Gorn, the ruthless warrior, is captured by orcs. ORCS! Lester becomes a slave for the orcs in varant. Milten is the only one who retains his prior credability. This is unacceptable. These are the characters who made the first and second Gothic feel immersive and memorable, and they have been reduced to nothing more than laughable shadows of their pasts. The game only becomes playable with the Enhanced Edition Community Patch, which you can download for free. This patch adds performance tweaks, and a much needed price overhaul.In conclusion, ♥♥♥♥ this game. If you played the 1st and 2nd gothic, then give this one a shot just for the continuation of the story. But if you didn't...STAY FAR AWAY			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Wandered in Myrtana: WingGothic 3 is great culmination of Gothic Saga made by Pirahna Bytes(For everyone who thinks Arcania: Gothic 4 is culmination - ♥♥♥♥ You).Even though this game was made in 2006, graphics, audio and story are unforgetable even now, in 2016, nearly 10 years after release (13 October 2006). For those who played Gothic 1 and 2, 3rd part can be completely different, I mean, bigger map, more NPCs, more quests, other fighting style, more... definitely MORE SKILLS, and the most important thing - This game is finally hard, but only when you'll install Community Patch 1.75 in connection with Quest Pack 4 + Content Mod 2.6, and before starting the game you'll turn on the Alternative AI and Alternative Balance, this will make enemies don't stand like idiots and waiting for dead, they will be harder, they need some sort of tactic to kill, and if you'll spam LMB, you'll die in 90% of timeGame itself have 3 endingsInnos Ending - Good ending, humans win, orcs are minorityAdanos Ending - Neutral endingBeliar Ending - Bad ending, orcs win, most of humans are slaves, Paladins are deadFor players of Gothic 1 and 2, you'll meet many of your lovely friends, for exampleGorn, Milten, Diego, Lester, Saturas, Xardas and more!In game we have few ""factions"" to chooseRebels - if we are going to Innos Ending, we are helping them, if not - killing themOrcs - Same as above, but with Beliar Ending, we are helping themPaladins - Only a few of them survived when Magic of Runes was destroyedAssassins - Same as OrcsNomads - Same as RebelsFire/Water Mages/Druids - Nothing special, they just areBarbarians - Neutral, they hate Orcs for invading their Ancestors' Tombs.Remember in Gothic 1 and 2 you had only 1 land? Gothic 1 - The Khorinis Penal Colony ; Gothic 2 - Khorinis and Irdorath for a moment. In G3 you have 3 lands and you can wander through them looselyVarant - Land of desert, Nomads, Assassins, Ruins, Water Mages, Cursed Temples, Beliar and everything what's funny!Nordmar - Land of snow, Barbarians, Fire Mages, Innos, and everything that wants to kill you (Yes, even snow)Myrtana - The biggest land, of hiding Rebels, dominating Orcs, slavery, and thousands of questsBut even though there is bulk of side quests, we have only few MainFind Xardas - Main Quest for 75% of the gameFind 5 Adanos Artifacts - Main Quest for 85% of the game (Until you find Xardas, the quest is hidden)And here's difference, it depends on which side you choose, I chose Innos so I got this quest:Liberate Myrtana - Liberation = Banish orcs from every city in MyrtanaSUMMARYGameplay - 8/10 - It's nearly perfect, if you forget about bugs and glitchesAudio - 10/10 - Masterpiece, Clean Masterpiece, for me - Funeral March of Gothic SagaGraphics - 9/10 - As 10 years ago, it's clean, nice, NPCs and monsters are designed pretty nice, and whole world is beautifulStoryline - 10/10 - Same as audio, this story is continuation from G1 and G2, it's Funeral of GothicDifficulty - 5/10 (With QP4 + CM 2.6 + Alternative AI + Alternative Balance - 9/10) - Without Community Patches, it's too easyOVERALL - 9/10 - A Masterpiece, culmination of Gothic Series, with great audio, undying graphics, beautiful story, shocking gameplay. For true fans, or RPG fans, get this. Let's just underline that Completing that game took me loosely 50 hours, beautiful, worth of 10€, 50 hours... ",149,16,1,17,11,1,9

Without patching it, ...you'll have a rotten piece of a game in your hands (the metascore didn't lie) filled with bugs.(If you want you patch it, take a look at the Discussion section on the Community Hub, you may eventually find a thread were you can download the patch there)			",138,24,6,19,13,2,16

												Gothic 3 proves that if you increase the territory of the map, but don’t have enough character to give it, it will feel shallow. You start the game with you’re 4 companions and kill  some orcs, after that they all leave and give you a total of one quest each when you find them, if you did not play Gothic 1 and 2 you would be asking yourself why are they so important that they get a ending resolution.And pretty much applies for the rest of the game, you go to a city,  you talk to anyone that has a name, then you go to the rebels that have names, you do all the quests that are neutral and move one to the next city. You lack any care for most of the tasks you are given. because they are mostly a source of XP and money. The hero is the only interesting character because he does not take anything seriously and comments about repeating cliches you have to go through.Leveling up is a costly business, every attribute, skill or spell costs a fortune, and makes it so that at certain points in the game I had over 200LP but because I was saving money, they ware useless, nobody gives you skills for free. When you actually manage to get that much money and actually have some fun, the game is great, it’s a shame it has to be such a chore to get there.The game looks graphically better than G1 and G2, however it has stutter issues that might even freeze your game. The game does not close properly sometimes.  Beasts and NPCs may clip through the terrain during combat, a few times a beast was stuck below the ground but kept fallowing me and NPC ware reacting to a beast nearby, but could not attack it.Combat: Range is not auto-lock you actually have to aim, melee and magic are auto-lock making it difficult when fighting more than one enemy.Melee, a difficult task that boils down to who can stun-lock the other first unless they block.Range, get a rock and hope they lack range weapons.Magic, this time I actually played mostly as a mage and it was a lot of fun, mostly because you can get regenerating mana(eventually), it was the only combat that made the game reasonable and satisfying.The Gothic Trilogy at least gets a proper closer.

												Ach, Gothic. That's the game you like to back from time to time. I remember those times when I spend in it so many hours. Play clean version and enchanted. Gothic was and is great. Sense of humor our hero, views, music, gameplay. They all great. Maybe now in so many years later it's hard to back. I know, I'm sure I will return to it many times in future. Don't understand reasons maybe it's graphic or gameplay or something else, just in this times when we have so many games we can play, Gothic is invisible and can be boring for some people. I know this game very well and my problem can be I remember all this adventures I have in it. And all of them are very important for me. Those was awesome times when I was traveling across Myrtana and other two countries we have available in this world. And still one more thing, You can't just gave it couple minutes of your time, this game need hours to understand her fully. That's can be reason for me why I can't for now at least, return to it. Sooner of later will return and again have this wonderful moments in this great world but for now. If you reader haven't play it, even in this times of hyper realistic graphics, give it a try for a sake and memory of Good Times of Old Players.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I´ve played Gothic 1 years ago and hence the many negative reviews that followed G3 and Arcania at their release gave the complete collection a try. I have to say: G3 (with the MASTERPIECE of a community patch!) is a very good game. Yes, it has a clunky battle system and you absolutely HAVE to be a wanderer to find what you need to complete quests (Map is... well, Gothic-like: no quest markers, only markers for main cities and villages) and YES you need your time to get good in something, but imo it´s totally worth it.There are 3 landscapes to explore, each with new enemies (despite Orcs) and complete new locations, you can cooperate or fight with 6 factions, gather raw materials for smithing and brew potions and there is hidden treasure everywhere. The overall story is quite generic sometimes, but it keeps you looking for answers.If you are a fan of Gothic and Risen it´s well worth your money, even if it is not casual friendly at times.

												People need to understand that alth it's a sequel to G1 and 2, the scenario changed. The nameless hero came and saw the war is over. He needed to do something. Even tho it doesnt outright spits it, the game says you must kill orks and regain control of Myrtana. Nuff of that. Combat system is different than G1 and 2 but you get used to it. Get it if you played the other two games. WOULD NOT RECOMEND TO PLAY IT IF YOU DIDNT PLAY THE OTHERS. YOU WONT ENJOY IT. -->If you want to play this on a new machine, prepare to download Gothic 3 Community Patch 1.75 and install DX 9 by yourself. The game will run smooth and with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of FPS.<--Have fun!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This review is for people who have played Morrowing or Oblivion, to help decide if Gothic 3 may be of interest to them.Gothic 3 is one of my favorite games.  Though the initial release was quite buggy, the community patch available these days turns it into a very playable game.  This review will assume you are playing with the patch installed, as described in my instructions here:Gothic 3 Optimization StepsGothic 3 is a classic open world first/third person RPG like Elder Scrolls, so there are many similarities between them.  In a way it is a mix of many of the good parts of both Morrowind and Oblivion, though there are also some general differences from Elder Scrolls that should be covered first.There is no character creation: you will play as the male human nameless hero, period.There is no respawning of creatures or flora; once you clear an area, it will remain clear.There are basically no books of lore or other reading material for people who like to spend hours reading about the history and culture of the world.  That said, I think the Gothic 3 world often has more detail than what is found in Elder Scrolls games and does a good job using those details to flesh it out.  Every detail of the world often feels carefully hand-placed, such as this screenshot of the entrance to Montera, with individual stones spread around from the broken walls after war with the Orcs:Ruins of MonteraGothic 3's world is also completely seamless: there is no loading between areas, not going into houses, into caves, between the different major regions, never.  This has a huge positive impact on the overall experience, since it really feels like a completely open world, and in practice you can take advantage of this with tricks to get to places you aren't yet ready to go.  You will often find yourself in this kind of situation, looking on an open city thinking about the ways you can go about exploring and exploiting it:Looking down on BakareshGothic 3 is more ""gamey"" than Elder Scrolls games.  The Elder Scrolls games try for a certain sense of realism, as a way I think to try to make them more ""immersive.""  Gothic 3 in contrast tends to wear being a game on its sleeve: character progression is very numeric with learning points you use to raise stats and gain skills along with gold needed to pay to do so; tactics you use for success in the world are often based on playing it as a game (rather than what is ""realistic"").  Even the main character's voice acting often makes me feel like he is self-aware of being in a game and giving another sarcastic comment about another freaking fetch quest.If immersive realism is something you find really important, that isn't Gothic 3's style.  However, its gamey-ness has benefits: not being realistic allows the art design to be much more interesting (I often say I feel like I am wandering around a beautiful painting), allows it to have a more exaggerated scale compared to how Elder Scrolls games try hard to hide their gamey world scale, and it can just be fun to figure out all kinds of tricks and ideas to take advantage of Gothic 3's more visible game systems.Maybe Gothic 3's world isn't as immersive, but in many ways I find it more interesting and engrossing.Those differences asside, there are many more similarities between Gothic 3 and Morrowind/Oblivion.In many ways, Gothic 3 sits somewhere between Morrowind and Oblivion in experience.  It came out soon after Oblivion, and has many of the improvements that one would expect from that generation of games, yet still has many of aspects of Morrowind that were lost in Oblivion.  That isn't to say that it the best of both games, but it has a nice combination that may appeal to people who loved Morrowind but found Oblivion lacking.Gothic 3's graphics are in the same class as Oblivion.  It has a lush, dynamic world (with moving grass and trees), dynamic shadows and lighting, fairly high resolution textures, and is comparably rich, detailed, and complex.The world is a more traditional fantasy environment compared to Morrowind's interesting alien world, but doesn't suffer from the blandness of Oblivion.  It has three unique environments: the central lush wilderness region, southern desert, and northern snowy area; the world also feels much more hand-crafted, with little details everywhere you look and very little repetition.All of the dialog in Gothic 3 is spoken -- both NPCs and your own character.  This results in quests and dialog being along the lines of Oblivion: more simplistic than Morrowind.  However the world is huge, with a lot going on, and is much more connected together than in Oblivion, adding more complexity that way.  Even most of the side quests (including simple fetch quests) are fairly connected to the larger picture, since they will impact the feelings of the factions towards you and how you can further interact with them and decide how the game will progress.The music in Gothic 3 is fantastic.  The sheer quantity of it is at the level of Oblivion if not more, but it is not in the background and bland.  The quality is much more like Morrowind: strong melodic pieces that will transport you back to the world when you hear them again.  It is also much more connected to the world, with very distinctive themes for the three different regions and even sub-regions of those.  The first time you walk over a desert hill to view some ruinfields stretching out away from you, with their theme playing along, is not something you will forget.Gothic 3's world has a lot of verticallity, much like Morrowing and something I found lacking in Oblivion.  It doesn't go so far as to have a levitation spell, but the world itself is filled with interesting use of height which you can use to your advantage or can get in your way.  You will often find yourself looking up at something and trying to figure out how you can get up to it.  For example, this huge hill in the distance that begs you to figure out how to get up there to check it out:New goal in life: get up thereOr this view after trekking up a high mountain pass down on to the open castle and city below:Looking down on FaringIn these games I tend to prefer bows over swords, and for that I find Gothic 3's combat to be far better than Morrowind and a bit lesser than Oblivion.  It doesn't have the physical presence that Oblivion was able to create, such as the satisfaction of sneak attacks with bows and physicality of swords and shields, but does have fairly fun interactions for aiming and shooting bows, blocking with shields, etc.  Sword and shield play is maybe a bit more tactically interesting than Oblivion, since there are different moves you can make and you need to watch the moves of humanoid characters to determine when they are going to make themselves vulnerable.  Fighting creatures I find to be much less satisfying, with them easily getting past your defense; in fact I seem to often find myself looking for high ground I can take to shoot arrows or bolts at them while they can't reach me, much like using a levitation spell to the same effect in Morrowind.  (I have also not been above leading some creatures back to a city for the guards there to help me take them out.)Finally, there are basically no physics in Gothic 3, which is a negative compared to Oblivion...  but then again compared to how little of interest Oblivion did with physics, maybe not.  Characters do have rag dolls when you kill them and the equipment in their hand will go flying.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Please, ignore my gameplay hours, you will find in my post why.Well, for the year this game was made it has great graphics, i think the best graphics for that time, please don't forget it is made in 2006 and don't forget they were forced to relase the game sooner. It is an inimaginable game for that time and I strongly suggest you to play it.In Gothic3 you can be whatever you want, you can fight for the Orcs or for the Humans, you can be from a full thief to a hero, from a strong warrior to a smart age, you can end it in different ways, it's all about you. You have all the freedom you want, but you explore it at your own risk. You have a lot of side quests and a great main quest line. It is more action-orientated than other Gothic games because you will fight with your own army (yes, your own army!) for saving cities from enemies, etc.I suggest you to play it's predecessors to see how much the game evolved and because the storyline continues from the end of Gothic2. For all of those saying: ""I am a Gothic fan, but I don't like Gothic3!"" well, then you are not a Gothic fan, why could you say something like that? Same storyline, same characters, same awesome hero, it is not Arcania, it is Gothic3, it is really good and unlike Arcania they really keep the storyline.About the Community Patch, yes, you need it for the game to run well, but if you can play a better game, why should you complain about the Community Patch? Don't forget that the game was forced to be released soonerI know I have a low gameplay time, because I have a really weak laptop, but I still love the game because it is simply awesome! :D 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A brilliant game from Piranha Bytes, the guys behind the previous Gothic games and the Risen series.Gothic 3. Probably the best experience of my life.Damn, guys. I'm awful at writing reviews as I never know what to say, but this won't really be a review. This will be.. my experience with this series, you could say.I remember playing the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of Gothic II when I was younger. This series is the best RPG series i've ever played in my entire life. Now, I know it's not the best, but what i want to tell you, is that the experience that I had with these games will never leave my mind. The story is great, i will never forget any of the characters, even the minor ones. The graphics in Gothic 3 are still very good to this day. I never played Gothic in any other language than my mother language, which is Polish, and i always loved it. Almost all orcs had the same voices, many human characters as well, but to hell with it, it was still brilliant. I spent more than 1000h+ in this game and i still play it a lot. I have this kind of a cycle, that every year i have to complete it at least once. That's how much fun i get from this game. I almost forgot to mention the soundtrack. Kai Rosenkranz, you are a genius. Gothic 1 and 2 have had brilliant soundtracks and what he did in Gothic 3 is.. incredible. They finally hired a real orchestra for the soundtrack. I.. really don't know what to say.. Right now, i'm getting really dizzy because it's.. I.. I really don't know what to say. The moment i start listening to the soundtrack, I instantly leave this world and feel like i'm in the world of Gothic. It's amazing. It's something i have never experienced before. Just go and listen to Vista Point.. or Northmar's Clans, or really anything else. They are all beautiful. Oh God, my eyes literally got wet while writing this...You know what i really hate right now? The feeling that you, the reader, can't experience all the things i have throughout my whole life while playing this series.The devs got a lot of hate because the release was AWFUL. Really awfull. The game was nearly unplayable. And even the Steam version is not really that great...AND HERE IS WHAT I WANT TO SAY TO ALL THE PEOPLE THAT POST NEGATIVE REVIEWS OF OLDER GAMES.Please guys, patching/modding the game by yourself is not hard, and by giving a great game a thumbs down on a review, people will see that, and the chances that they'll buy this game will lower. I, for example, never say a game is♥♥♥♥♥♥because the Steam version sucks. Why not? Because i don't ♥♥♥♥ing care. I can patch/mod it by myself. Just google it. It's not hard. There are almost always fixes for older games that require the work of the community in order to run on newer systems. Even the Steam Community Guides will help you with running the game. So please, install the Community Patch before judging this game.I don't care if i get any thumbs down on my review. I just hope you can understand what i experienced throughout this series. How it is literally bond to my soul right now. It's like something i can't live without. I don't know what else i can do to convince you into buying this... Sorry.. I just want you to know that this game is something different from other RPG's.. something that literally (i think i'm overusing this word :P) changed the way i feel when playing it. Or hearing the soundtrack. Anything that has to do with this game.. it's just an amazing experience. Please, buy the whole trilogy and maybe you'll understand.tl;dr Don't judge the game by the Steam reviews. Community made this game awesome, and i love them for it. The soundtrack is the best i've ever heard (and i've heard a lot). Gothic 1 is brilliant, Gothic 2 is even better and Gothic 3 was something different.. something i really fell in love with. It's only 9.99€, it's cheap as hell. Buy it. You won't regret it.PS. Piranha Bytes, i love your work. You made something that changed my life. Please, make ELEX a great game. Not like Risen 2 and 3.Edit. I forgot to mention the community of this game. It's one of the best communities i've ever seen! They are very dedicated to what they are doing. I hope the community will survive for at least another 10 years :)Edit. Still my favourite game to this date.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Even tho many people did not like this game back in the day because how unfinished it was and how it kinda felt like a none Gothic game, I still think this game deservs your attention today. Community has made the patch that fixes and balances almost everything. Although I dont understand why Piranha Bytes did not patch their game themsleves after a few months, instead the community had to do it. I guess JoWood screw them up so hard that it probably had the effect on that as well. Also I would recommend you downloading the Conted Mod too. It brings back that old ""Gothic"" feel that was kinda missing from the vanilla game. Soundtrack is spectacular, one of the best soundtracks if not the best I have ever heard for any video game. Its so atmospheric and it fits the mood perfectly. Quests are kinda boring and the combat sux (I would recommend playing as a mage or archer), but the overall exploration and the beautiful world the game has with the great soundtrack just makes you play more. You have deserty and snowy areas also, each one with their sort of people and their story behind them. The developers paid so much attention to the details, it brings the immersion to whole another level. Gameplay is fun, but the main story not so much. Its a typical story you find in many games, movies, books you name it. Overall Gothic 3 is not as good as G1 and 2, but its a very underrated game and the graphics are very nice considering this was made in 2006. Very demanding for PCs back then tho lol. If you like to play games for pure fun, atmosphere, exploration etc. this is the game for you. But dont play this first or even worse only. Buy Gothic 1 and 2 NotR. Those games are a must play. You can also try Risen 1. With that game they proved that JoWood screwed them up  with Gothic 3, because Risen 1 feels more like a Gothic game then Gothic 3. Dont bother with the rest of the Risen franchise tho. Below avarage games. Gothic 3 gets a score of 7.5/10 from me. FYI Dont look at my playtime, I had this game on a disc (still have it, just like all PB games) but I decided to buy it on this steam summer sale just to support the developers even more. Got the Risen 1 and 2 also :D (Dont know why i got the 2nd one doe lol). I have beat PB games many times and I think they have great replay value.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'll start by saying that this game, in its most basic form, is not Gothic, which is partially expected. It's a different engine, In fact, I find that this game has far more in common with Two Worlds than with Gothic, which is a mixed bag for me, because I don't consider TW to be a terrible game. However:1) This game seems to make all of the mistakes TW made, with none of the redeeming factors.2) This game is not TW. It's Gothic. I've played the other games and had some expectations going in on both the style of the series and its pedigree.	From a technical standpoint, the game is below average. The music, while obviously still professional, isn't as memorable as previous games. The graphics are glitchy. Many of the plants pop in and out of existence, some surfaces on buildings are missing, there are a lot of crappy ragdolls, and models for ""unique"" characters are shamelessly repeated. The controls are either laggy or bugged; Even jumping doesn't work most of the time, and enemies phase through objects.	On the normal difficulty, it's far too easy. Where before it was all about recognizing patterns, this game resorts to button mashing. While the combat system of the previous games made crowd combat impossible, the idiotic AI here finds it acceptable to maintain a reasonable distance and stare menacingly while I run straight into the thick of the group and chop them all down. Most will block attacks, but since blocking doesn't block all damage, it just takes longer to deal with enemies who are constantly on the defense, and does make them any more of a threat. The only real threats are baddies who are too strong or fast to be dealt with in one long♥♥♥♥♥combo, and mages who just wreck everybody's♥♥♥♥♥♥	Like so many RPGs, the game tries to feel like an breathing, living world, but it falls short in many aspects by not going into nearly enough depth to be believable. The reputation system, for example, is just an arbitrary number that keeps track of who I've done quests for (like one of the shoddier features of TW). It's not a dynamic system that actually reflects my behavior with the characters who make up the factions. Say, if I got my rep with the orcs up to 10, and then I murder a stronghold full of civilized orcs, my rep will still be 10. Sure, I'll get questioned about it, but my reputation will remain intact... unless I do it twice.	The flow of the game is what seriously damages it. Being able to accomplish most of the main quest in whatever order I please is nice, but every part is the same exact thing: Go to a settlement that has a quest item, be denied access until I complete a bunch of smaller quests to be allowed entry, get a bit further in, get blocked again by someone who tells me my reputation isn't high enough, and go through the same stupid stuff until I finally get to the quest item. Then I have to do that like ten more times. Only towards the end does it get interesting.	There are a boatload of problems with this structure. For one thing, it just isn't fun. Hiding the primary objectives behind layers of samey, repetitive ♥♥♥♥♥ work makes me feel like I'm never making any real progress, even when I am. Of course, the game's freedom provides the means to simply slaughter everyone in my path, but the only time I do that is when I'm frustrated by the mind-bogglingly slow pace of adhering to the quest structure, and even then, the populations of entire cities will just be replaced by generic NPCs who provide less depth than its original inhabitants.	I wanted to like this game, and it did at least pull off an open-world RPG, but the established functions of the first two games should have been refined, not wiped off the table in an attempt to reinvent the wheel. It almost feels like it was one of those things where a valuable franchise is passed onto an owner who doesn't know or care about what made it great. The incredibly sloppy execution made this game far more frustrating than fun. Also, ♥♥♥♥ that ending.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of all: the community patch is a must! The game is not playable without it ;PAll in all a great, old rpg. If you liked Gothic1+2, you´ll also love this part. Lots of swearing, nice dialogues, diversified quests, character building. Still got its old Gothic spirit.The only thing I hated (and I REALLY hated it) was the combat system. Either become a mage or some ranger, don´t focus too much on melee, because fighting is really clunky and even in endgame, when you got used to it all, not really that great. I spent 80% of my fights either running away and shooting the enemy with my bow or standing on some plateau/wall/stone where they couldn´t get me and shoot em down from there. Heck, even the enemies often have massive problems attacking you: a lot of enemies can be beaten by simply walking backwards and shooting them. They´ll catch up to you, swing their weapon, walk up to you again, swing their weapon...without hitting you. Not to mention that sometimes the arrows just fly through the enemies (especially snappers, damn beasts...).IN A NUTSHELL: Focus on ranged attacks and you´ll be fine.Nice, enjoyable, LONG(!) game, good soundtrack, makes a (imo) good end to the story. (since nobody ever wanted Gothic4 ;) )			",94,5,0,8,4,0,2

												(Played this game before when it got released. Bhought it again after lost the CD)So first off. This game is amazing.. For that read other reviews. Im using this more to fix some issues i had with the controlls and i seen some people having them in the negative reviews. So first off try running in compatiblity mode Windows XP Service Pack 3 to fix the mouse lagg. After wards download the  Community Patch [www.worldofgothic.de] to increase performance issues and make it prettier. (best review.. i know. just want to help. Sorry.)*Edit* If that all doesnt help u try rightclicking the game and disable steam community stuff for this game.			",563,127,19,92,59,10,73

												I absolutely adore the Gothic series and sunk many hours into Gothic and Gothic 2 before starting Gothic 3. G3, at launch, was a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mess. Pushed out before it was ready by JoWooD to stave off their death, it was met with bad reviews and an angry community who questioned why the sequel to Gothic 2, one of the best Western CRPG's ever made, could have ended up like this. However, years and years of community support, patching, modding as well as the onward march of hardware have restored this flawed work into a masterpiece.Gothic 3 is *massive* in scale, scope and ambition. Continuing the outward expansion of the series that started with a prison colony in G1, Khorinis as a whole in G2 (plus the land of Jharkendar with NOTR) and now an entire continent of which includes three massive land masses, all with completely different settings, characters, factions, quest lines and items. There is the lush, green forests and fields of Myrtana, the sweltering desert of the Varant and the frozen mountains of Nordmar. They aren't the most original places when it comes to medieval fantasy works but the execution is terrific. My only complaint is that Varant is kinda super orientialist and I wish it was handled better. The story picks up immedietly after G2 with the Orcs finally winning the war that has been waging in the background of the first two games and having conquered all of Myrtana except for the last remaining stronghold of the King. Orcs have enslaved most of the population and it's up to you and your crew from G2 to free the continent! Or not. You can choose to fight along side the Orcs, or you can carve your own path through both of them. It's exceptionally freeform and there are a lot of variables that you can touch in order to effect the ultimate outcome of the game.There is a *ton* of stuff to do in G3 and even after 60+ hours I never saw everything. There are entire questlines and paths through the game I never saw, and that is super cool! There is also a lot of room to develop your character, with the standard Learning Points system that has been in every Gothic game up to this. One thing I didn't like that was changed from G1/2 to G3 was that health became something you had to spend LP on to increase, but that stopped becoming a hassle eventually. Just know going in you shouldn't ignore it! Combat is also fun and responsive with a suprisingly robust moveset and ways to fight, but even with end-game gear and stats, stunlocking from even weak enemies such as wolves remains as much as a problem as it is in the early game. Now for some of the negatives. Despite all the incredible work the community has put forward into patching and fixing G3 over the years, performance can sometimes leave something to be desired. I don't mean in terms of framerate, I mean in terms of weird hitches and stutters in weird areas that can't be cured even with the help of the G3 Clean-Up tool and a super fast SSD. The game is pretty stable now, but ocassionally weird open world janky stuff will happen, like deer falling from the sky. I didn't encounter any broken quests or crashes in my 65 hours with the latest community patch installed along with the newest (as of the time of this writing) Update Pack which fixes some of the lingering issues and adds some really nice quality of life features to the game. It's important to note that if you are going into this game expecting a super easy experience, you are going to be in for a bit of a shock because G3 dosen't really roll that way. Now, this can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it, but in my personal experience, the journal/quest log and navigating some areas in Nordmar kinda goes past the ""this is tough but fair"" line and straight into ""what the hell does this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t game want me to even do here"". Again, YMMV. Also, just as an aside, it's kkkkkkkinda weird how there are barely any women or people of colour in the entire game. Seriously. I don't think it was intentional but the only non-dude character you can talk to in the game either have only one line of dialogue and have no name or are exotic dancers that you have to escort. That's it. In conclusion, if you are looking for a really good, slightly janky but incredibly deep western CRPG, look no further. Gothic 3 will fit that bill and then some!Tools and Mods links:Community Patch v1.75.14: http://forum.worldofplayers.de/forum/threads/1140053-Gothic-3-Patch-1-75-releaseUpdate Pack: v1.04.10: http://forum.worldofplayers.de/forum/threads/1347969-Release-Gothic-3-v1-75-Update-PackG3 Clean Up: http://forum.worldofplayers.de/forum/threads/1225965-Ank%C3%BCndigung-Beta-Release-Gothic3-Clean-Up ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game, so open ended you can play it through several times, but you really have to apply the community patch online for it to work, and it will erase your savegames. So install patch before you start playing, also because the game runs and looks like a turd before you update it. Note: Steam does not install this very needed update, you need to google it.

												Amazing game, unfortunately with lots of bugs, so I recommend installing the Community patches and mods (World of Gothic has great guides also about the order in which to install them) they really lift the game. Then it does feel the way you would expect the sequel to Gothic 2 to feel, with all the Gothic-typical ups and downs: High difficulty (= frustration but even bigger satisfaction once you manage), huge open world and extremely addicting. A must for fans of Gothic and Gothic 2 (I recommend playing those first).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of my favourites, as I play it again on Steam. Though G3 is buggy as hell, but still very enjoyable game after all. I downloaded patch 1.5 and the game is not buggy anymore.I spotted flickering and lagging in game, though I have better computer than ever, seems like the game is not compatible well and the performance jumps from smooth to laggy.To rate Gothic 3 I will give it 4 of 5 stars. Open world with many beasts to kill, many quests, towns and hideouts. Dialogues are somehow all right, enemy fights are sometimes frustrating, sometimes they get stuck on some object so you can snipe them off. I recommend to play this on easy, as hard is only different in spending more time with more HP pool of enemies but the play style does not change, you only need to put more exp into skills before going in battle with some enemies.To add, the game is worth the money (10€), though its downfalls do not make it best game, but I can still enjoy it more than most trash games just grabbing money and no content whatsoever. G3 has a lot of content in it, though sometimes seems not finished.It is really open world, I tried to travel to far edges of map, but there are no plants, beasts or chests, sometimes not even trees and flora. So the game is kind of linear in that way, you will gain very little by travelling all over the map. But sometimes you find the strong beasts nearer to edges hidden before humans and one very important character. Look for the edge of n. 3 on the map and you will find him.It seems there are 3 possible endings. After 80 hours of fru..., ehm, fun I finally got the items I needed for finishing the game though that was the first I needed walkthrough video only because I was not focused on looking into every chest in the marked place.

			Gothic 3- A fantastic and underrated gem. A great RPG for anyone looking for freedom in just about every aspect of the game. A TRUE open world RPG, open character development and free choice.		

Gothic 3- A fantastic and underrated gem. A great RPG for anyone looking for freedom in just about every aspect of the game. A TRUE open world RPG, open character developement and free choice. I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves RPGs with a more action oriented combat system and is willing to take the time to patch the game with the community patch and is looking to scratch that itch that comes with an open world RPG; endless hours of exploration, quest, crafting, character development, factions to join and fight, a world to shape the way you see fit, gaining new powers and seeing new sights. Gothic 3 is a very buggy game by itself admittedly but, for $10 and a loving community who is AWESOME and has worked out most of the bugs and revamped the game to be more balanced and run smoother, it is easily worth the time and effort and frustrations that may come with it.. -Thumbs Up from RoyialVideo Reviews can be found at: www.youtube.com/user/RoyialNetwork ",349,48,4,71,30,3,49

												It's different from other RPGs.Also, it is hard. You will die many deaths that are likely to be embarassing, predictable, frustrating, totally unexpected, or some combination of the preceding. Shadowbeasts don't play around!That is why it is Gothic, and not Mario. You will not save the world by charging at the forces of evil with your sword drawn - it will be a long and difficult road to building yourself up and amassing valuable gear, before you can hope to be Jesus of Narnia.An RPG made with a different mindset - already worth it.

												As a huge Gothic franchise fan, I need to say Gothic 3 is still my favourite. I played all three of them (several times), including Night of the Raven add-on (Gothic 2) which is amazing as well. One thing is, you MUST to play this game with the latest community patch installed, otherwise it's not playable at all. I believe Gothic 3 got bad ratings mainly because of the state it was released in – glitchy.All in all, that's an amazing RPG, my favourite before the Skyrim. I won't write any details since there are so many great reviews that encompass everything. My last thought is that I really wish PB will create another Gothic someday and continue the story. But right now they are working on another game called Elex, and it will be available this year, 2017.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have always loved this game.  I highly recommended it to others as well as playting from the 1st Gothic because all the stories align with each other.  The first two games controls are a bit rough, about a 1 hour learning curve, but well worth it.  Also, you really have to download the community patches to make these games come to life due to early pushing of the producer.  The community has done a great job to maintain this game as well as fix almost all bugs from the first 3 in the series.  Have yet to play the 4th game but look forward to it.  I have bought every game in the series so far and will continue to do so.  Good alternative to games like The Elder Scrolls if you're looking for that immersive, huge world gameplay.

												The first 3 hours consisted of looting villages with their residents not caring and running away from small pigs that headbutt you to death as well as monkey-goblins with sticks.The next 3 hours contained running away from giant trolls with large sticks and orcs that you can only see from 6 metres away because of the game's render distance system.I ran into a giant city with a forcefield around it and killed myself accidentally because I didn't realize I couldn't enter the city at all.In this game, the deer equivalent are packs of wolves roaming together in lofting green fields, and the wolf equivalent are small pigs that can kill you in groups of 3. The wolves jump through the fields gracefully, chewing on the grass happily with their kin. The pigs however, are meat eating, campfire starting, forest lurking beasts that are an unwreckable force when there are more than 5 or 6 of them in a group.The game is quite fun, but the only issues I have with it are the previously mentioned render distances which also affect landscapes harshly, the lack of a good tutorial system, and the fact that it still carries some bugs involving combat and movement around steep terrain.

												I know Gothic game are imperfect products and that their quirks come to be loved, but the combat in Gothic 3 is just plain awful.  At it's best, it's a tedious bore, at it's worse it's a stun-luck death spiral.While I loved the first two in the series, after playing almost 60 hours of this one, I can safely stay to stay away - save your money and save yourself some time.

												Gothic 3 is♥♥♥♥♥♥ I loved gothic 1 and 2, I grew up with these RPGs. Gothic 1, while still rather clunky in its mechanics and controls, is still very enjoyable, thanks to the great world, characters and story. Gothic 2 took everything good from Gothic 1 and made it even better. Less clunky controls, smoothed out mechanics, bigger world, better story, more characters to like. It was pure Action RPG bliss. While Gothic 2 from a technical standpoint was just a more polished Gothic 1, Gothic 3 has nothing in common with it's prequels, technically speaking. And it just ♥♥♥♥♥ over everything that made the original 2 games so great. The World is bigger? Sure, but it's also got less stuff to do in. The graphics have more polygons and stuff? Sure, but it looks so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ugly and somewhere between plastic and rubber. The story? What story? You move from town to town, decide if you root out the rebels or the orcs, goto next town, repeat. Same for the Desert, except the factions names are different. In Gothic 1 and 2, stuff happened, there was tension, there was drama. In Gothic 3, nothing happens. Sure you liberate some cities and stuff, but it doesn't really tell a story, you just grind through progression. The Combat in this game is one of the most hillariously broken messes I've ever seen. First of all, go full one handed melee in this. Archery or even magic is just not worth it. Which is ironic, considering how ♥♥♥♥ing overpowered enemy mages are. You'd think your level 20 hero would have no problem fighting a measly goblin mage. ♥♥♥♥ that noise, he deals an insane amount of damage. My only strategy left was to basically circle around him so that his fireballs miss me and hope I get close enough to pummel him into the ground before he incinerates me. And there was that one time I fought an Orc Shaman. He got stuck in a doorway and spammed fireballs at the nearby wall. So I just pulled out my bow and slowly chipped away his health from afar. As he was almost dead, he quickly pulled out a healing spell, fully healed himself and switched back to the fireball. That took him just a second. All my effort worthless.It's unbalanced beyond believe. Wanna kill almost every humanoid in close quarters combat? Spam light attacks. Everytime you hit an enemy, they will flinch and then reset to normal combat stance, before they can strike. Flinching+striking takes more time than a light swing. You'll cut through anything with that. And as cool as poisoning your blade sounds, it's useless. In order to apply the poison to your enemies, you have to stab them by holding the attack button and pressing down. Normal strikes don't poison your enemy. But why would you do that, the stab takes way too long. Also dualwielding Swords is only usefull, because it allows you to attack with two swords at once with heavy swings, but not with light swings.Overall: This game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ Be glad you don't have to play Version 1.0, that taught me to fear boars. They were able to bite faster than I could counter, so I was locked in an endless flinching frenzy, which only ended once I was dead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												this is a classic staple in how to make a good open world action rpg that has sandbox qualities. in that it gives you quests tells you where they can be completed ( in a manner) and you can go do it or you can wreck the guy who asked you to do it then wreck his family convince the orcs your a 'boss to be reckoned with' and team up with that bad guys and really do whatever you like.i followed the quests and took out each stroing hold as i came a cross one at a time and found id made a name for myselfnow the orcs attack on site.its just wonderful how the game reacts to your decissions very enjoyable, yet challenging combat.one of the best arpg s around.(just a side note this game works pergfectly on my asus rog laptop and alienware x51 pc, however i found that gothic 2 and 1 dont work passed the main screen be ware if buying on modern pc windows 7)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Finally, after waiting 10 years for being able to run this game (yea yea, I haven't upgradd my machine for quite long :) ) I must say, that all the rumours were right - this game is buggy and heavy (in terms of CPU/maybe GPU usage). Luckily, the Community Patch really turns it into a playable game, but still remember to save a lot, so F5 aka quick save is your best friend, not only in case of your death, but also cases like NPC you are taking to some other place falling into movement dead loop (literally, can't go out of building or go past some other obstacles and you should pick other route). What's more ... it really is a Gothic game :). The last one in the series, in terms of being made by the same studio thst was responsible for Gothic 1 and 2 (+expansion). This game is much, much bigger, than Gothic 2. What's positive, this game has no chapters, so theoretically, you have access to everything right from the start ... but if you'd try to check if that's true, you'll have to run away from all kinds of enemies quite a lot :P Like in previous games, you can pick one of 3 main ... powers: Innos, Beliar or ... no, not Adanos, Xardas :D I am writing about powers, because the actual faction relations change and it's not so obvious who serves which ""god"".Long story short, this really is a good game even if you can sometimes see, that it was not fully completed. It is on the same level as the previous games and MUCH better than the following G3 standalone addon (Forsaken Gods), which was created by some other studio.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is very fun, I managed to get it for like 3$ and I gotta say, it's worth it. It feels a bit like skyrim (In a way), a cool mechanic they added is if you're knocked down, the enemies can loot your gold and current equipped weapon. It's brutal at the beginning and the combat is repetitive, however there is a bit to go around when it comes to the amount of content. Btw some animals like wolves for example have this very annoying spam attack that can obliterate your health in seconds. So I'd give this a game a 7/10. A Above-Average game with a few cool mechanics thrown into it. Get it if on sale or if you're inpatient just buy it for about 10$.			",124,8,1,8,9,0,5

												it's like a lot of the bethesda rpgs (morrowind, skyrim, etc) but with some small caviats in gameplay for me. here's the pros/cons:Pros:-good voice work for character-graphically still playable (although on the lower end of acceptable in 2015/16)-lots of skills, spells, and reputation/experience systems athat are really neat in contrast to my recent ARPGs of late (Witcher3 and DarkSouls 2), getting spells requires certain skills and learning points, and praying to gods.-big and attractive world to explore freely-no lack of quests and gearCons:-no crosshair or frame of refrence when in 3rd person... I never know if I'm aimed at someone to talk or not. and grabbing items off ground is very hard to tell what you're grabbing for/if you miss something-requires a community patch to be playable at all-inventory/UI is fairly lackluster in means of RPG-standards (still havent found an 'equiped items' or character screen)-the story so far is generic as all heckOverall I'd reccomend if you're looking for a new RPG and have drained the available pool of fantasy RPGs that've come out in recent years. But be ready for some 'getting used to' if you're not familiar with gothic games			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't know what it is about this game that I keep coming back to.  I've installed this on various systems over the years and recently bought it on Steam.  It's so frustratingly breakable.  The fight mechanics are so bad, it's laughable.  The AI is so incredibly dumb.  I can't even say ""It's so bad it's GOOD!"".  There's just something so nostalgic about the game that It bothers me that I haven't completed it yet.  It gets down into my bones and I need to keep coming back to it, like an abusive relationship.  It's so quirky and buggy that I have to love it for what it is.  It's strangely beautiful for how old it is.I've patched it all up and it works pretty good now, irrespective of all the bugginess of the AI and plotline.  If I accidentally do something out of order, every orc will attack no matter what I do...  you basically just have to start over at that point.  Maybe that's what's so alluring?Hey I really want this thing to work on Steam Link with the Steam Controller.  It's just not working for me for whatever reason, and it's really bugging me.  I want this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game on my TV, STAT.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Even though it had an exceptionally buggy launch, Gothic 3 continues the series' trend of being a MASSIVE game with deep RPG mechanics and plenty of challenge. They revamped the combat system for better flow, massively improved the inventory system, introduced a more user-friendly (yet still robust and deep) skill system, and brought with it a gigantic world rendered wonderful graphics for the time (which still look quite good, actually). It was released the same year as Oblivion and got massively (and unjustly) overshadowed by it, so if you're an RPG or Gothic fan, it's definitely worth looking at.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game. Definetly the longest game out of the series and most epic chalange. I loved the area of Mortana. Desert felt somewhat unfinished or something and nothern lands felt overpowered. However, the gameplay was great and endings just as good. I have played all Gothics I, II, III and love coming back to those games. If you have not played this game, get it. Visuals are not up to todays standards, but gameplay is nice and difficult as it should be.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Generally slow combat systm and a lot of running around with no purpose, even for an open world game.  The system for leveling and character development essentially requires using an FAQ to sort it out and keep it straight.  It isn't a terrible game on its own, but there are a lot of other games in the same style that are much better accomplished and more fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is by far the best RPG of all time. Although there are a lot of bugs in the combat, mainly the enormous bug of it just being click-click-click-win, the scenery and the humble attitude of every character in the game make up for it.In addition, the world is HUGE. After 30 hours of exploring, you barely get half of the map done and you still haven't found all of the secrets, caves, dungeons and lurking ogres behind you.Despite all of the above, the supreme aspect is the amount of diversity the game offers you. 3 different endings, many different races you can be a part of/join and the possibility of being an outcast and just simply slaughtering everyone.100/100 would buy again and again			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gothic 3 is every fan's wet dream. Contrary to what most fans complained and still complain, this game is a dream come true. PB delivered to us what anguished us all along. Nordmar, the northern land inhabited by rough warriors and blacksmiths, the legendary smiths that you read and hear about all along. Varant, the last place where Lee fought against the 2 Varantian warlords. Myrthana, your homeland, goverened by King Rhobar himself. The one, who convicted you to the Penal Colony.And while the main storyline is not completely dull, what kills the most important aspect of the game is the faction system. No matter what you are, Orc Mercenary, Hashishin, Paladin, Druid..no one will greet you or remark about those things. Gothic 2 did it right and for that it will always be my favourite.All of these factions, quests, places are laid out in a non-linear environment  waiting for you to explore it. Accompanied by majestic soundtracks. Make sure you install the last Community Patch from WorldofGothic.com and enjoy it to the fullest. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This part of gothic is just great. Many endings, many possibilities and options. Its just quite difficult. Story is interesting, I went through all endings (at least I think so) and I'd recommend this game to anyone. There is just one thing: its not gothic 1 or 2 anymore. People are fussing around because ""its not gothic anymore"" and stuff like that. This game has been released 4 years after gothic 2 so its obvious that it'll be different, that there will be a lot of improvement, both technical and graphic. There are bugs as well, thats for sure but for me everything went for the best.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												an ok Game, Not one of the best storylines, the world is not making you feel like you are part of it as much as games like TES: Skyrim or Fallout 3/New Vegas. I kept running into bugs that involved quests not completing correctly so I had to load and retry several times.Other times I experienced that quest items did not spawn, or questgivers that had gone missing when I got back.the combat system of the game is not one I would call great, its quite simple and a bit dull in the longer run.at one playthrough I I came to the part where I had to chose sides, and I had pretty much only helped one side and decided to go with the other, big mistake, I had basically killed off most of the questgivers and vendors and could not progress at all.All in all it is an ok game, but you quite often end up frustrated over things not working properly and if you are the type (like me) that forgets to save extremely often, you often end up having to do alot of stuff again.I recommend this game if it is on a 50% sale or more.

												Gothic® 3 has received a lot of hate from fans of the previous Gothic games, It is a really good game In my opinion, not the best one but a really good one.The gameplay was better in the second game but I guess It could be worse so we'll do with it.The game can be really confusing sometimes, the quests, the map, pretty much everything but the game itself is good.Just 2 things I do not like which are the freeroam and the ending.Do not except  The Elder Scrolls or even a Fallout game, it's open world but at the same time it's linear.You cannot continue after the ending, not even a new game plus.Those are 2 big flaws that are common in the games made by Piranha – Bytes.For some, it could be positive but for a gamer like me, they are both flaws.It's pretty much the same for every Gothic and Risen games, just that some have a better story, gameplay, items etc than the others.If it was truly open world with unlimited freeroam and we would be able to continue playing after the end, I would probably give it a 8/10 but since it is not the case I'm giving it a 7.5/10My favorite list:1. Gothic II2. Gothic3. Risen4. Gothic III5. Risen 2: Dark Water6. Arcania: Gothic 4 (I wouldn't consider this one as a Gothic game though)They are all good In my opinion, but some are more worth than the others, of course, they all have their good and bad.If only they would have a true freeroam and no ending.7.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First, i wanna say i completed the game before to write this review....Only my love for the Gothic serie forced me to give a positive vote to this review cause the overall experience was more negative and i'm going to explain why....The game itself is pretty nice, the questline is interesting and amusing (great longevity as always) but the technical part of the game is one of worst i ever experienced, a lot of crashing toggled my fun out, also there is a terrible stuttering issue happening really too often cause of no optimizations in this game, to end the negative things, altough the first 2 i already mentioned were the worst, is also a really bad and not user-friendly combat system making sometime like impossible to dodge or parry the attacks of some of the enemies, just to make an example, i start the attack and the mob dodge 10 times in a row my attacks then he hit me and keep hitting me for like 7 bites in a row not giving me any chance to avoid his attack, this with me using the best weapons and having high skills and after mastered to the max...In conclusion, i have to say that this is a sad example of a nice game ruined by bad programming, with a little of more effort on beta testing and with some better ideas this could have been 100 times better....I was able to complete this game just because i've the patience of a Saint, but not everyone could have the same...Without the crash problems this could have been even the best Gothic of the trilogy, such a pity :(Gothic 2 remains, in my opinion, the best of the Gothic trilogy !My Final Score is 69 /100  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gothic 1-3 (I haven't played the later ones yet) are extremely fun, rewarding games and it is very sad that they are not as popular as Elder Scrolls.  Morrowind is my all-time favorite game and although I love TES to bits, Gothic succeeds in many areas that TES is lacking.  For example, it is fully voice acted and done very well.  The city and castle designs are a bit more... real.  NPCs behave like real people, going to bed at night and lounging in predictable areas during the day- they don't run all over the place so that it's a pain to track them down.  Quest givers are very straightforward and clear about what you need to do and there is an excellent quest tracking system which records the dialog so you can reread all of the details and sorts quests by town it was given in.Gothic 3 does have some AI issues- like NPCs getting stuck and just standing there while you kill them- but for the most part the AI is quite good.  Animals roam together in packs and will attack you if one of their members is attacked.  When fighting a large group of enemies (which is all the time in this game) they will usually circle around you while you attack 1v1 with one of them, and then another will move in after that one dies, although they also randomly jab you in the back often.  It may not be completely realistic, but it does feel pretty cinematic to be encircled by enemies without being ganged up on by all of them at once.One of my favorite things about Gothic is the dueling system.  When you win a fight with an NPC they are not dead, just knocked out, and you must perform a kill move to actually kill them.  Winning fights with the most seasoned warriors of every village is actually a good way to build reputation (and make money in the arena.) It also allows you to get away with things like attacking someone and robbing them without being murdered by NPCs in response.Gothic is a COMPLETELY open world.  You can go anywhere and do anything, although you are subtly urged to see certain areas first in order to progress the story.  But for the most part the story can work regardless of what you do or see first.  The setting is absolutely fantastic, with 3 distinct countries to visit, many large towns populating them, with lots of forests, caves, rivers, mountains and grasslands to explore in between.  And the diversity of animals and enemies is very good too.Like Gothic 1 and 2, Gothic 3 does not have a strong plot.  It's orcs vs humans as usual, with pretty much no character growth or moral messages or anything like that.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it's probably one of the reasons Gothic isn't more popular- it doesn't pull on people's heartstrings or get you emotionally invested at all.  The world is incredibly detailed and immersive, but there is not very much lore.  Gothic 3 expands a little bit on the story of the 3 gods, but it only scratches the surface.  Although the 3 distinct human cultures are very fleshed out in details such as architecture, clothing styles, manner of speaking, etc we never get to learn their history which is really a missed opportunity.Plot-wise, one of Gothic's strongest points is that your actions REALLY do matter and have a real effect on the progression of the story, and this is even more apparent in Gothic 3.  You can choose which side of a war to support, and a great deal of the game is about you earning the respect of different factions, either to fight beside them or later betray them.  You may find that something you did earlier screwed you over.  Personally I make a new save every play session and don't overwrite it just in case.Now, here is what I don't like about Gothic.  It's hard as hell, and sometimes not in a fun way.  Gothic 3 is a lot better than the older ones in this regard, but sometimes the amount of enemies is excessive.  You will be ganged up on by packs of wolves whose attacks are unblockable.  (I've heard the community patches fix the wolf issue, among other things.) You often have to battle an entire town of enemies, either by yourself or with a couple NPCs who aren't much help.  I absolutely love the feeling of participating in a war this game gives me, but you should have a bit more help on your side.  In conclusion, I rate this game 9/10.  If the combat was less frustrating it would be a 10.  I would recommend this game to anyone who likes RPGs, and I would definitely say play Gothic 1 and 2 first if you haven't-- both great games and Gothic 3's story is a direct continuation from those.

 The end of an epic franchise... First off - I played  and finished Gothic 3 on a non-steambound copy, so my amount of played hours is inaccurate.As you can see by the pictures on the store page, Gothic 3 is an old game with aged graphics (which WERE top notch in 2006/7) so if you can't stand playing without more up-to-date graphics but still want to have a simular experience you should check out Risen - the spiritual successor to the Gothic series. Combat in Gothic 3 feels different and less brutal than in it's predecessors and you could say that they kind of botched it by making it too imbalanced – button mashing is the most viable tactic...Despite having (nowadays) outdated graphics the soundtrack and voice acting of Gothic 3 good most of the time (at least the german voice acting - sadly I haven't heard the english one yet). The map is large and littered with monsters, trinkets and cities. One of the largest differences to the two prior games is the even larger map, which is divided in 3 large areas – a desert, a large area of hills, plains, coasts and forests and an icy area in the northern mountains. You'll journey across this map and interact with different fractions – you'll even be able to conquer cities to influence the ending.Gothic 3 is the third (and in my opinion LAST*) installment of Piranha Bytes ""Gothic"" series. The launch was rushed and the game recieved bad initial critics for plenty of issues but I still found it to be enjoyable enough to be a fitting finisher for this awesome series. It's story begins with shortly after the ending of Gothic 2. The nameless hero from the first two games returns to his home-continent ""Myrtana"" and finds it to be overrun by Orcs. From there on you can basically go everywhere and ally with everyone you want – from slavery-approving assassins to Orcs to the last resistance of remaining humans...Gothic 3 treats you more gently than it's two predecessors, combat is easier and weapons as well as armor is faster to be aquired – But the game will not hold your hand and you'll have to figure out how you can reach your goals - making it even more rewarding if you solved a complicated quest or  if you managed to take down an enemies camp/city by slashing your way through enemy hordes.Fighting in this game can make you feel like a god and CAN be very rewarding, but due to problems with poise and staggering it can also easily screw you over...After playing a while you'll be able to permanently join one of three fraction mentioned above. Each fraction has a unique realtion to the people of Gothic and you'll be treated in a different ways by NPCs depending on which fraction you chose – But I found this feature to be more visible in the prior games... The questlines and sidequests of these paths differ a lot and are all genuinly well implemented - even in the late game, giving you a solid reason for replaying.Overall Gothic 3 is (in my opinion) an extremely detailed game with plenty of hours of fun and immersive playtime to keep you busy – it's huge and will take hours on end to be completely finished, even by the most determined players. There are many secrets to discover and to collect... But the game sort of lacks connections to the excellent background lore and feeling of Gothic 1 and 2, so I would only recommend it to veteran players of the franchise.*(I refuse to call the Forsaken Gods Extention or ""Gothic 4 – Arcania"" a part of this awesome franchise... Those two games were horrible and butchered the franchise if you'd ask me.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Finally finished Gothic 3, it was a loooong journey. It's an open world RPG just like Skyrim or oblivion, you have to get the latest community patch to make it playable.It's a faction based system where you visit each city hub and complete all quests related to that city. The world is divided into three areas, forest, dessert, and snow. Towards the end you make a choice on which faction to support.Combat in the beginning is quite hard, it's recommended to avoid some areas for later. As you level up and obtaining new skills, it gets easier. Enemies don't level up with you.It's an older game from 2006, it still can be taxing on your system. It's quite epic, although it does get quite dull towards the end. I would recommend this game if you have a lot of free time to dispose, else it's hard to finish as it took me months.

												Rather fun game, it has a open world but sadly no ""Grind"" to it as in no respawnable monsters or items, they only respawn once every chapter.... so get killing before changing, well they do respawn after 6 - 30 ingame days.I love the nature of the game, it feels alive but sometime gets the saee feel to it.The combat: It's kinda silly but it has a Oblivion feel to it except the one hand sword's... Spam Right click  and Orcs aren't that dangerous, Only the Halberd ones cause they got a spammy Animation 0.3 attack D: (SAME GOES FOR THE WOLFES)The quest plots with the charaters are great, not the best but fun.

												Gothic 3 is the 3rd game of the series and it's the most balanced.The game has the forests and the coast of Myrtana, the mountains of Nordmar and the desert of Varant.You will be going through a number of cities and will be working for a lot of factions (rebels, rangers, Water mages, fire mages, paladins, nomads orcs and Nordmarians)The graphics and the sounds are great.The game is easy but it's still hard if you apply the community patch.You can choose to be a ranger, a mage, a warrior or a bit of everything.The only problems i can think of is the story, it  ain't as good as the previous games but it still is good.It also had bugs at the start but most of it is fixed.I recommend the game, you will enjoy it.

												There's so much beauty hidden in the lands of this game, it sucks that all the bugs that it came filled with make it look so bad. I liked Skyrim, but the Bethesda game didn't have half the charm the Gothic 3 world has. There's a lot to do and a lot worth being a part of: traveling through and deciding the fate of the villages, cities and fortresses that are spread in the three complex and beautiful lands(snow, forest and desert) of Gothic 3 is one doesn't easily forget. Put the community patch on, get past the first couple hours(yes, it's a kick on the teeth at first) and experience a great, old style adventure.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game and at first was deeply disappointed because it was not playable at all.  That is until I loaded the 1.75 patch.  Why does this game not install with the most current and only playable version?  Then I had an error where the game would go black, then a message would moments later state that the game was blocked from accessing my graphic hardware.  I looked high and low for a fix.  I went into my firewall and allowed the game, ran it as administrator and finally I figured out the problem.  I turned off Vsynch in the game and now it doesn't freeze with the message I mentioned.  It is now playable and actually a fun game.  I would have liked to have had more items in the game, and the fighting could be a little bit better, like having the ability to roll from an incoming blow, but it is still worth the money.  That is after you fix all of the initial issues.  Additional comment:  After playing this game to it's very end, I realized there was one item that would have made this game so much more enjoyable and that is this:  Since the game does not help you locating individuals and objectives, a map editor that allowed you to make notes on the map would have been awesome.

												I dont know what the hell happened to this game on Windows 10 - I've got brand new GTX 1060 and game runs on 30-40 fps on highest quality @ 1440p. And mouse doesn;t work at all. I don't know how to play this anymore on my new PC but game itself is awesome. I loved all Gothics but 3rd one gets a huge prize for great open world and the fact that we finally get to see Myrtana. Very good classic but don't expect it to work. I don't either, it's time for Gothic 3 to stay in the past. RIP Gothic 3.GRAPHICS - 6/10 - good enough in terms of graphics/open world-ness; but Witcher 1 came out year later and it looked WAY better than Gothic 3.MUSIC - 8/10 - on point, very gothic-like, stays in the climate.CONTENT - 9/10 - a crapload of content for 2006 game. Never seen so many locations in an RPG game untill I played Oblivion and Skyrim.GAMEPLAY - 9/10 - very entertaining once you get into it, supper addictive and lots of fun.9/10 wouldn't look for Xardas and pisss on the main quest, rather explore on their own			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is freaking huge! Not as memorable as Gothic 2. I am loving the different creatures in the set. I had to buy a map 2/3rds in the game after I realized how big it was and hashashins telling me about a desert. I was able to locate the desert after a long adventure down south. With the patch the game is just as good as 2 worlds II.Something that the game could of improved: better AI for characters and acting for characters. Plot to story was really needed. So far I been to so many towns and wished the towns had souls. If you are a open world lover buy this!3/17/2017Where do I start... I just beat the game and after 200 days of in game time play I finished it.There is some alternative endings feeling to it and I never found Xardas. The game had me waste so much time on perking and doing tons and I mean TONS of quests. I had fond memories with Gothic 2 and the third title just is a little too much but worth spending. I remember how I felt when i wanted that paladin armor so bad... its an honor to carry it, hope you feel the same.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It ain't Gothic 2. And it's quite buggy, even with community patches and such. But it's still an ambitious and absolutely beautiful RPG with some really interesting mechanics (like how virtually any NPC can be killed, even those crucial to quests), that I would recommend it as an impulse purchase for those looking for something a little different. It doesn't feel as ""mass produced"" as the Elder Scrolls series, for instance. It's more ""Hand made"", even if it stumbles a lot. Check it out, it is easily worth buying at least at a discounted price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got this game on sale for  < $5, money very well spent.  Huge 3d world to explore.  Plays somewhat like skyrim although obviously much less finished with clunkier combat.  Very enjoyable game for the price, a definite gem.			",22,2,0,8,0,0,9

												Although I've been a fan of the Gothic games back in the days (don't let my played hours fool you, I must have put hundreds of hours into the series), in 2015 I have to say these games have the worst annoying fricken combat ever. I just can't play it any longer because I get so angry that it's not healthy. The first two games were better, with less bugs, so less annoying, but the combat was essentially the same lame♥♥♥♥♥unresponsive ""ungh"" fest.I do recommend it, it's not a misclick. I would recommend the first two installments though instead of the third. Gothic has a very atmospheric feel, great interaction, exploration, and it's a great RPG. I just can't get past the combat anymore.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Possible, the greatest old gen rpg I've ever played. The world is so immersive, the game is comepletly open world. The world itself is consistent on making you feel like you are actually in the world. The combat system is not the best, but its not like the boring point and click, it is heavily skill based and you will have a permanent death after a certain number of times you have collapsed.  Overall It mixes the great points of Witcher 2 and the immersiveness of the Elder Scrolls series. NOTE this game is very, and I say it again VERY long, thats why I like it so much. I would rate this game 9000 out of 10*important note, if you are planning on playing this game you will need to download a community patch to stop the bugs from happening*			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Best RPG ever!I've played games like skyrim and two worlds and for me Gothic 3 is my favorite.  This game is for true hard core RPG, unlike in games like The Elder Scrolls, Gothic 3 doesn't hold your hand.  Gothic 3 starts brutally hard especially at the hardest dificulty and you can get killed with ease if you don't know what you are doing.  In this game monsters don't get harder as time pasess, all monsters are at their max setting and it's up to you to over come that.  It's a fully open world, no load time for anything.10/10 Buy this game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gothic 3. The third in the epic series.What can i say about the franchise except that this is the only series that has me playing for entire days and nights without losing interest.I know this is an old title but i didnt own a good system till now. And especially after the latest community patch, I believe whatever was lacking in terms of combat has been fixed. Bigtime.It has a lot of depth. Huge worlds, lots to explore, surprises here and there and a gripping storyline. The charater building is also very rewarding, no matter what path you choose.The good thing is that the dialogue choices are not too vast, its open as well as linear in a perfect way. You have the usual classes of fighter, archer and mage and im sure most of the players have finished this gamee while playing mage.This game makes you feel in a certain way, and nothing can recreate the first time you experience it.Hands down this should be in every RPG enthusiasts game kitty. I know gothic franchise is the BEST in PC games for me. Im at around 80 hours gameplay and I think im at less than 50% completion. I may be wrong. Ive yet to finish this, but i know RPG fans will love it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												--(Install the latest patch before you start a game otherwise you have to reinstall the game.)—--(Mods can add to gameplay but I don't recommend it)----(for 1366x768 Resolution check the guide)--This is a wonderful game, very interactive realism mixed with necessary unrealistic events to balance situations. The only problem is without the community patch the game is buggy glitchy and annoying. The graphics at the time are great and today to my standards are pretty darn good, you have to love the open world, and the fact that anyone can die. The combat is fun and great, there could be better animations but with the time it was created I guess that could cause more problems I guess, not so sure. And I’ve played mash key combat games and it’s not fun. This is the type of RPG I like compared to others, I've tried another game from the same developer Spell force it's alright but not my style. To today's standard this game would not be appreciated but you have to keep in mind the time. What makes this game so much better is the large community that worked together to create patches and additional features for the game. The fact of choosing your side is great, you can choose any action but there is a cost. The player can benefit one faction or just go ♥♥♥♥ everyone over and kill as many as he can. Voice acting is well done, not too crappy or just text reading or too emotional, thou there are a lack of women and other people. As well as horses, but I guess they don’t exist in the World of Gothic for some reason or another. Now the music is great I was surprised at how well it is, thou particular areas the music can be really loud and annoying especially with headphones, but that’s so common anymore makes no difference other than I hate it, balance please I like my ears.

												Oh boy, Gothic 3. The first game I've ever hyped and the first game to utterly dissapoint me.The story is much weaker than the previous games and makes little sense - basically, there are only about 4 main quests that drive the plot and the rest of the game are sidequests. The endings are horrible and there's a lot of plotholes. Dialogues are weak as well, the characters from the older games went OOC and you have barely any interaction with them, much unlike Gothic 1 and 2. Some earlier characters somehow appear in Gothic 3 either without any explanation or when they have no reason to.The world is big, but the lack of interesting places and general emptyness makes it boring. Towns are pretty detailed, but they're small and seem to be copypasted. The houses mostly look like makeshift shacks, which is really weird comparing to Khorinis. NPC's are cloned and ugly, even the Nameless Hero's friends. Armor and clothing lack variety.Combat is atrocious - click your enemy to death. No tactics, stunlock galore, horrible animations which don't even change when you level up your combat skills. Magic is pretty useless. The word ""balance"" does not exist in Gothic 3.People say that the music is the best thing in the game. I disagree. Though it does sound good, it really wears out and gets repetitive quick. Vista Point and the combat music became so annoying I had to shut off the music. The problem is that putting one track per country isn't a good choice. Khorinis had several tracks according to areas.The ""gothic"" feeling is lost due to silly monster redesigns, almost zero immersion, cartoony graphics and way too ""epic"" orchestral music.Despite the effort of the Community Patch Team to make the game playable, it still remains a mess with an engine that works on duct tape and glue. JoWood rushed the game and Pirahna Bytes bit more than they could chew.For 10 years since Gothic 3's release, I still pretend that the ship we left on in the end of Gothic 2 is still sailing out there.

												Gothic 3 is an Action-RPG and is the 3rd game in the series and at the moment I consider it the last game (unless Piranha Bytes does something with the license again). Never before have I had such mixed feelings over a game, there's so much potential that was never fully realized and the negatives of the game really overshadow the positives. The reason being is that Gothic 3 was never finished, Jowood, the game's publisher, decided one day to just say ""♥♥♥♥ it, let's release the game"" and it was nowhere near finished, if Piranha Bytes was given more time, then this would've been a fantastic game, but as it stands, it's an extremely buggy and frustrating mess that underneath it lies what could've been a worthy addition to the Gothic series.The story continues from where the second game left off, you arrive at mainland Myrtana and find out that the orcs have won the battle because the mages and the paladins have lost their power at some point or something, and now orcs are the new rulers thanks to Xardas, so when you arrive with your friends and liberate a little village called Ardea, you have to find Xardas and fix this whole mess. Overall, the story is pretty terrible, it goes all over the place and more often than not you just forget that there even is a story, but the setting is great, humanity is essentially ♥♥♥♥ed and the orcs are the new rulers and you get to decide whether you join the rebels and liberate Myrtana or join the orcs.Let's start with the presentation: This game, even to this day, looks absolutely gorgeous, so much color and attention to detail, the atmosphere is fantastic and there's a lot of variety in the areas you'll be visiting, from the lush green forests of Myrtana, the face melting heat from the deserts of Varant to the cold snowy areas of Nordmar. The animation quality is kind of mixed, when it works, it's pretty good but for the most part it all feels a little stiff, and weird and a bit awkward, and speaking of weird and awkward, the modeling, especially with the characters is just terrible; it's really obvious when you see all the main characters from the first two games in this one at the very beginning, it seems like the art style from the previous games stayed while the graphics have improved, everyone looks really terrifying. But as a whole, the game looks really good, for the most part. It's worth mentioning the soundtrack because I think it's easily the best thing about this game, holy ♥♥♥♥, by far the best soundtrack in the entire series and it's such a shame it's in this game of all things, it really deserves better than this because it's a perfect example of how you do orchestral music right, it's beautiful and I can easily start tearing up just from listening to it, it's that good.Now, onto the gameplay, oh shit♥♥♥♥ almighty what a mess this is. Let's start off with the things I liked, the biggest being the faction system. At the start of the game you can choose between joining the orcs or the rebels and the more quests you do for a certain faction the higher your reputation gets, the higher your reputation gets, the more the faction likes you and other factions might despise you for it, it's a system that works really well and it's more consequences to your actions, it also gives the game a lot more replay value, unfortunately though the game is so frustrating that the replay value kind of dies off. Another thing I like is the liberation system, if you choose the rebels' side, when you go to a town that belongs to the orcs, you can decide to liberate it whenever you want, essentially having to kill everyone inside until the orcs decide to retreat and the town afterwards belongs to the rebels, it's really cool and very satisfying when you finally pull it off.Now, onto the♥♥♥♥♥♥of the game: the quests are very bland, there's a LOT of content in this game but most of it is very MMO-like quests, get me X amount of this, go kill that, it's not particularly interesting but it's nice how it ties into the faction system I mentioned earlier. My biggest issue with the game and what made me scream in pure rage countless times was the combat system, what the ♥♥♥♥ were they thinking? You know that fantastic combat system from the previous games? How it's very timing based and punishes you for treating it like a hack n' slash? WELL GUESS WHAT, GOTHIC 3'S A ♥♥♥♥ING HACK N' SLASH! And not the good kind, like spectacle fighters, no I'm talking about repeatedly mashing the same button over and over again until something dies. It took me a lot of time to realize this and get used to it. I initially tried playing it like the previous games but found myself constantly dying but then it clicked for me, I figured out that you have to constantly mash the same button to get your enemy in a chain stun and not give them a chance to hit you, because the moment they do, you have no idea whether you’re going to live or die, the animations for the enemies' attacks are way too fast, so you can never react to it in time and it also means that the enemies can get you stuck in a chain stun and you often don't survive it. The combat system is actually not so bad when fighting humans or orcs, but it's a complete mess against monsters or animals. At the very beginning of the game you take out countless orcs, but walk out a few meters outside Ardea and you'll get your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you by a single wolf, it's broken beyond repair. And it’s not like the previous games where you slowly build up to becoming the ultimate badass, no, you’re pretty much the same throughout the whole thing. I do however like how there's a variety of attacks, though you’ll mostly be spamming the same button over and over again so it doesn't matter, there's also a huge variety of weapons, you have single handed, two handed, dual-wielding weapons along with ranged stuff like bows and crossbows, but it doesn't help when the meat of the game is so horribly broken. But the biggest issue is that the outcome of battle is completely random, one time you can take out a pack of orcs without a scratch and other times you get chain stunned by a Scavanger, as a result I had to quicksave before every single fight because who knows what'll happen? That leads me to the loading times. Every time you die, you have to reload your save AND MY GOD, the load times are horrendous, every single loading screen takes about half a minute, and that might not seem like a lot but it builds up, every time you boot the game up, every time you die, which happens often because of the game's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and it's just aggravating. The game wouldn't be as frustrating if the loading times were shorter, because dying meant I'd have to sit through another half a minute of loading.Gothic 3 is a giant mess, even with the community patch, I can't recommend it to anyone. It's cool to play some of it once to see the ambition and potential Piranna Bytes had with this, but it's all so very rushed and broken, it's almost not worth even giving it a look, and that's so unfortunate. I really hope that one day we'll get to see another true Gothic game like the first two, but it feels like after Gothic 3, Piranna Bytes never looked back on it, they moved onto Risen but after the first game they ♥♥♥♥ed it up again.Still, Gothic 3 is better than Oblivion. I would much prefer to scream in frustration than to be bored to tears.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm new to the Gothic series, but after having played better games of the same genre (i.e.: Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen), this games feels seriously lacking in many ways.My first impression with the game is that combat wasn't going to be fun at all.  You are dropped off in the middle of a orc invasion with almost no tutorial or guidance.  No ""dodge"", blocking that only partially works, and no ""Game Over, Reload from last saved game?"" prompt after you die.  As guessed, after almost two hours of game time on record, I can definitely say that you will not play this game for the combat mechanics.  Some ennemies are ridiculously hard (small green goblins, really?!) and others are ridiculously easy (group of large orcs with axe, large lizards, mantis, birds, lurkers, ...), walk backward and swing your sword should kill 95% of your foes.On other fronts, luckily it gets better.  You can go about playing this game in whichever way you want.  You can complete a quest before speaking to quest givers, you can kill the guy you were supposed to rescue, you can make friends or ennemies of different factions, your actions have a true impact on your surrounding world.  The world feels amply big yet filled with nooks to explore and always another chest or plant/flower to pick up after the next road bend.I've had limited exposure in my time to crafting, having only dealt with Alchemy; be ready to be severly limited in how much you can craft, vials seems to be in limited quantities and required for most potions. Its a good thing you can sleep off your pains and wake up with a full HP bar.I might have forced myself to play through the game if it wasn't for the constant crashes on reload.  Death will sometime come swiftly and the game crashes every 3 reloads for me.  Try this game at your own risks.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wanted to like this game, it looks like a lot of love has gone into it. However, this is a detailed, rich fantasy epic that has been hamstrung by a terrible combat system. Swords waving at nothing, cheap hits from enemies that clearly haven't connected with you and just a feeling of vagueness to the whole affair. Gothic 3 isn't a bad game, but you will struggle to enjoy it when your whole reason for being - killing monsters - is crippled from the start. Shame.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a game where you will want to save. A LOT (You will hate the game if you don't save)! Although it looks terrible in graphics, it still has a great story and fun people to fight. Like Risen the combat systems are similar.The quests are sadly extremely repetitive and creating an only mage or only thief is hard. You can obtain gold to outfit your character into either a spellsword or rogue. If you are into older RPGs like Fallout 3, Dark Souls, or  Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, this is the game for you.

												I feel like the Gothic series was trying to steal the Elder Scrolls thunder but then I started to really get involved with this series and realized you can't compare the two.

												The game is better then good, the rest of this review is me talking about my experience so far.today was my first 2 hours in gothic 3, it was cheap so i figured why not buy it and give it a try, i now want to buy all of the gothic games !the combat seems very strange but also very challenging, attacking and hitting befor your opponent does, wich usually means exploting the AI.this game is like a REAL adventure, you don't know where you are, whats going on and every single encounter i've had so far has been exilerating and full of just blasing adventure. for example ''i enter a cave at the beach guarded by white creatures, once inside the cave i find a band of goblins, took them out from range with my trusty bow, some of them with my staff, i found a chest with amazing loot ! spells and potions and gold ! i was observing my surroundings when i suddenly heard spider noises, i was hesitant to continue my exploring through the cave but curiousity got the better of me, ten i saw a spider like creature, like a minotaur but with a spider body, i got so spooked i backed up and unleashed arrows on it, but then the moment came i backpelled off of a cliff in the cave, that was the end of my life, my first death''something that would definately happen to someone in  real life encountering such a hazard i reckon, and that just sealed the stamp for me, this game is awesome.you find interesting characters all over the place, incredibly immersive structures, new monsters, so so much to explore.the best way to enjoy this game is to go in without expectations, the game has allready payed itself back an i feel i have a long way to go uintill i finished the game.

												I really love this game. To me it's a real classic. But what sucks about the steam version, though, is the fact that I cannot play this game in my native tongue, even though it was released in Russian, back in 2006... But if you can find it in your native tongue I highly recommend that you give it a much-deserved play-through, it's really worth it. I mean, the game is great. It's super expansive and the story is quite malleable, too.  Besides, nowadays, on a 6-core Intel processor like the 6800k it will run rather well with some stuttering here and there. However, if you have a 2-core or 4-core CPU it will be quite stutter-y (it really stuttered on my older 2500k machine).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For those expecting a traditional gothic experience, this game may be a bit of a letdown. For instance, in 1 and 2, darkness meant you couldn't see anything without a torch or light spell. That is no longer the case in 3, and only a few areas require added light. Also, gone is the overall ""creepy"" feel from 1 and 2. 3 is very colorful and bright. Those things being said, this still ends up being a great game for lovers of the gothic story line. While the combat is simplistic and there is no need to choose a faction(which may be a turnoff for many gothic purists), the story and player interactions carry this game. Choices do affect the outcome, and music, while more operatic and epic than the usually dire and dark music of 1 and 2, do grow on you as you play. All in all, this is a nearly perfect ending to one of the greatest rpg trilogies ever made.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You can help the Orcs or not.  Your call.  My first run I decided to kill all orcs on site.  I missed some quests but I can do them on the next run.			",45,7,0,5,6,1,4

												Liked everything, but the combat.The hitboxes seem off, I could be standing directly infront of an enemy and a hit not register, and then enemy who didn't come anywhere near hitting me, connects with my hitbox.  I did love the open world, what little i explored, but combat felt like something I would have thrown together in an xna project.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

YOU NEED THE 1.75 Community patch for this game to be any good. This game was rushed out too early and was sold with hundreds of bugs, luckily it had a good community ad they patched it and its actually playable now. I reccomend this game to any RPG fan that wants a hardcore game to hold their time. Beware though, the cobat is absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Somehow disappointing. Finale of series left me with bitter taste and at the end felt like more like a chore than a pleasure.The good:- very open, interesting world- captivating people, nice dialogs, lots of quests- the ""feel"" of gothic series was kept- community patchThe bad:- awful fighting and movement around the map- some skills are literally useless (don't work) or it's not sure if will work - pure magic weapons require pure magic blank which can be found in random chests with low percentage of finding it- lack of impact on the world - regardless of chosen path you can make 90% of quests and it barely affects the end of gameIf you feel you have to end gothic saga you could play it but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else.

 This game spelled the demise of Gothic  I still find it hard to believe someone spent almost a decade trying to make this game better. But even after all those years, all that the community patch achieves is a minor turd polish. Gothic 3 is just irredeemable and rotten to its core.The ""gameplay"" consists of three main components: walking, talking and combat. Due to astonishing amount of design flaws and bugs, as well as poor writing and uninteresting, shallow lore, it is the walking part, that I find somewhat entertaining. I think that says a lot about this game.The dialogues suck. Gone is the charm and cheese of the previous two games, there's next to no story, no real protagonists, no sense of identity. All you get is boring, dry and humorless exposition coming from static, unimaginative NPCs. The voice acting is traditionally cringeworthy and the dialogue options - for the most part - present just an obligatory click preventing you from succumbing to a deep slumber. There are so many quests for the player to complete, yet staggeringly, every single one of them comprises the generic ""fetch this"" or ""kill that"" element, which turns Gothic 3 into a seemingly endless orgy of meaningless chores.The combat is probably even more dreadful - it's utterly broken, yet relied upon heavily. Alternative balancing, introduced in the community patch, improves upon its mechanics significantly, turning a mindless clickfest into something involving a little more strategy and skill, but it's helpless when it comes to terrible design and incompetent programming. So much is wrong with the combat in Gothic 3, that I don't even know where to begin: unresponsiveness, slugishness, bad animations, random hit detection, zombie-like AI, broken pathfinding, lack of proper lock-on, lame combos, kiting, exploits, ridiculous ragdolls, unbalanced magic... Fighting with a torch in the left hand is near impossible. Worst of all, outside of magic, there's no real progression system and beyond the initial ""prerequisite"" perks (which are just annoying obstacles), all the combat ""skills"" are nothing but permanent invisible buffs to your damage output. In other words - what you begin with is what you'll end with, unless you're a mage.There are only two qualities, that somewhat justify this game's existence. It's the music and the map (just the map, not the world). Both of those are spectacular for the most part, though the constant repetition of the same single track during the combat has the potential to eventually drive you insane.Overall, Gothic 3 is at its best when you are strolling through its forests, listening to the wonderful music and ocassionally slaying some wild boars or deers. With that in mind, it can be fun for a few hours, but it's not enough to recommend it for purchase, since today we have better RPGs at any price point. True, Gothic represents a very unique approach to role-playing with its steep difficulty curve, openness and no hand holding, all of which is here (at least with the alternative balancing turned on), but these alone form little but a shell of a game.Please, support Piranha Bytes, but only buy this game after you've bought every other Gothic and Risen title, because I honestly believe all of them are much better than this.

												I wouldn't say the game is not fun.  The game is actually fun at times, but I wouldn't recommend it because the game is fricken long and there are much better games out there for someone to play first.  I only recommend playing this game if you are out of games to play.The problem with Gothic 3 is that the game maker ran out of creative ideas.  They took their old ideas from gothic 1 & 2 and apply to gothic 3 and by doing so makes the game long and repetitive.  You basically do some chores and killing some monsters for every town and every faction to get reputation points until you reach a certain reputation, and you do it again again again again again again again......The main story is subpar.  The chores you do are not tied to the main story.  The characters you met in story are shallow comparing to gothic 1 and 2.  The voice acting is boring comparing to gothic 1 and 2.What I liked about gothic 1 back then is the immersion.  When I got into old camp, I really liked the whole atmosphere.  Gothic 1's world had an awesome atmophere, and the game is like a combination of adventure and survival horror.  Gothic 1 made me want to explore more and fed my curiosity about what is gonna happen next.  Gothic 2 is less so.  The world of Gothic 3 is just stupid.  The world is boring.  The atmosphere sucks.  There is hardly dungeon like gothic 1 and 2.  Also there is no point exploring because there is also nothing up in the mountain and underwater.  The combat system sucks monkey balls.  When you attack, you have to make sure you are on low ground and not high ground because you would swing over monster's head and no hit anything if you are on high ground.  The main character is always under-armored against monsters which kill you easily in horde unless you keep spamming spin moves.  The magic is overpowered.  Once you get mana regeneration, the game is pretty much over.  Archer is under powered.  Basically, the game is not balanced.  Anyone playing this game is forced to play a melee fighter because magic and archery are repetitive, and most of the cool items are for melee path.Also it is stupid that the good stuff you get in this game are not from quests but from opening chests which are predetermined.  I spent about 180 hours and I am about half way done.  I actually wasted 50 hours in another game until I found out I don't really like alternative balancing of the community patch, and I had to start all over.  Right now I am about 2/3 done, and I don't feel like finishing it because this game has become repetitive and tedius.  I don't feel like doing any more chores, escorting any more people, delivering any more stuff, and killing any more bandits.  Overall, if you have never played this kind of game, you might enjoy it, but if you have played every open world RPG's and gothic 1 and 2, this game is very underwelming.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gothic 1 was like being introduced to somewhat mysterous person who's odd manner only makes him more interesting, yet this person can have a rather nasty temper, but no matter how he upsets you you just can't abandon him. You form a frail friendship and tag along like a kid brother.Gothic 2 matures the bond between you and said person, you've learned to put up with his foibles and the stories you could tell if your fantastic adventures could fill a book, he becomes someone you can truly regard as a friend!Gothic 3 is like watching that person slowly die from Alzheimer's disease.

I'd recommend you buy it cheap though, as you may have to save your money for treatment of the stress aneurysm this game will give you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Only pooring so much time into this game I realised what a mess it is.It starts out nice enough, with nice enviroments, it's cool mechanics, the freedom, exploration and what not, but it is after a while that you realise that under the surface lies a horendously broken game. If you try to vir off the beaten path you will break the game. Gothic 3 literally alows you to break it.One such instance is when I tried to assasinate the varant emperor. I just transformed myself into a meatbug and entered the city, and into the treasury. I hit from the inside and abusing the games broken combat system and silly AI, I killed the emperor. The game acted as if he was alive giving quests that could never be completed.BTW, Did I say broken combat system? Yeah, its fair when you want to fight lesser enemies. At least thats what it seemed at the start. Your enemies can leave you in a stunned state permanently until they kill you. Going over to fighting greater enemies it does not feel great. Its drab and boring and enemies take a hell of a lot of time to beat. Needless to say, fighting bosses is not exciting or fun. Theres also a noticable complexity to the combat mechanicsOther gripes with this are that theres not many models and voices for NPCs and you can tolerate seeing the same NPC with the same voice so many times, theres also a problem with the anachronistic names and the fact you can wake up people while on meatbug form.All and all this game could not be salvaged even with the impressive amount of modwork that went on.

I spent more time trying in the beginning trying to get my guy off the damn ground since he wont swing his damn sword unless I'm using my built in mouse and the ""Lock-On"" mode that is bound to R in my controls list doesnt even work... Yeah I don't recomend this for anyone. Hell my Gothic 1 and 2 don't work either and crash every time I try to start a new game and I get a weird error. So far, not impressed and I just wasted money on a series I can't get a refund for or even play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Невероятная игра, достоинства которой перекрывают недостатки.Леса, пустыни, горы, реки, моря... А эта музыка... Просто непередаваемая словами атмосфера.Единственная в своём роде игра, которая может захватить так сильно, что забудется даже прямой её конкурент - вся серия Elder Scrolls, и не отпускать, пока не пройдешь все три концовки и не заработаешь репутацию у всех шести фракций, а потом, посмотрев на часы, с удивлением обнаружишь, что сейчас утро. 11/10 по всем параметрам, кроме оптимизации.UPDATE: Одна из немногих в наше время игр, которая может затянуть ну просто навечно! Горячо советую сыграть, как только найдется несколько свободных дней. 5 дней, не меньше.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played this game with the community balance patch so the glitches and balance weren't a huge-huge deal. The game still felt rather incomplete. Certain areas weren't filled in and overall the world felt dead. It had some well designed areas though; the graphics were gorgeous and hold up to this day. It's just, the NPCs and the story felt forced. I just didn't care about any of them or any of it. The best way to complete the story and quests was to systematically collect everything and kill all the monsters in basically a grid-like formation. There was no thought, love, or nuance to it. Here's another big♥♥♥♥♥field or large hill with tons of monsters. Just run up and down the hill to make sure you've scoured everything and killed all the filthy 'beasts.' Get used to hearing 'the beasts'. 'Beasts' was the translators favorite word.Everyone had a quest for you and they were all basically the same thing. Talk to person, get something from person, kill enemies, collect items, go back and talk to person, the end. I stopped actually listening to the NPCs dialogue because it was boring, pointless, and lifeless.Edit: Grammar, I wrote this late at night, give me a break.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To preface this review, I played the game modded. Gothic 3 aspires to a lot - and could achieve what it sets out to do, but production hell has ensured that the game feels lazy and amateurish. The writing was uninteresting, the setting was bland, the enemies were about as fantasy-standard as you can get. You have little control over the developement of your character. The combat is clunky and pooly done. The game's style is quite beautiful, but it doesn't keep me coming back to deal with sub-standard gameplay.Not recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												And here comes a tragic end to a series I once loved. Gothic 3 is a trainwreck of a sequel thanks to executives pressuring developers to cut production time in half. Gothic 3 Essentially continues the story of our nameless hero to the main lands that is dominated by Orcs. (Not the fun WAAAAGH kind, but more like obnoxious klingons this time around.) You have to choose sides, and try to bring peace in your own image.You have some powerful enemies, like wolves, giant ants, wolves, shadowbeasts: big monsterous Tiger/Rhino hybrids, WOLVES AGAIN! I'm sorry, but shouldn't I be more worried about Humans and Orcs? That's right people, the beginner monsters are more dangerous as Wolves can stunlock spam you to death, literally while the main antagonists can be killed at level one...this is why you don't rush developers kids!Make a choice of going Warrior, Hunter, Maid-I mean mage, or a hybrid of the archtypes...though if you were smart, you'd either just go mage or hunter and spam range to deal with nature, thanks Piranha.Now don't get me wrong, the game isn't all trash, the story is still pretty decent and the music playing while exploring the wilderness is just beautiful...untill you fight humans and orcs then you get annoying horns going off dramatically, the same kind, every time.I loved Gothic 1 and 2...they were amazing classics and I really wanted to love this game but just couldn't. It's a failure, simple as that. 3 out of 10, would not recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the greatest games I've played. Spent close to 200 hours playing it.Immense freedom of choice. You can destroy entire settlements and take them under your control. You can serve or become a ruler yourself. A huge world to explore with lots of quests and characters. 3 Different environments to explore: from barren deserts to snowy deserts to grassy deserts (lel). Seriously though, countless cities and outposts, ruins, caves. One of the most atmospheric games out there. And it is a nice conclusion to Gothic series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can't reccomend these games for their price. Gotchic 1 & 2 required a lot of file tweaking just to run on Windows 7; and while 3 may have been more stable, the models look like they're made out of plastic and the storyline did not grip me at all. I would suggest investing the money, instead, into the cost of an Elder Scrolls or Witcher game; or even contribute it to an up-and-coming indie like Shroud of the Avatar.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can't recommend this game, 10 years later and the developers still had been unable to make this a playable game for me, other people might be able to play this game just fine with no problems at all but i seem to find nothing but gamebreaking problems when i try to play this game.Back in 2006, the game graphics would make the game lagg so badly that you could not hardly move at all and any fight would end up killing you unless you used god mode.This bug existed for years, now 10 years later..lo and behold the game still is unplayable.Current issues:Unable to attack anything with the mouseGet instantly knocked on your♥♥♥♥♥and be unable to get back upI am assuming this is a bug but who knows..maybe you are not supposed to fight anything in this game.Might be a community fix but i won't bother with that.I am just going to assume this game has a bunch of gamebreaking bugs like allways.I don't recommend the game but that is mostly because of my earlier experience with this game, there is really no way for me to change my opinion as the game won't even let me play it.

Its graphics are worse than that of gothic 2 and most of the content is copy&paste (Ex.Every orc warrior is the same orc in cutscenes and movement) Not to mention the characters movements are not as fluid or human compared to the other installments.Funny how there is no pictures with the characters or hud on the store page huh?Because its too much of an eyesore!The story ends at Gothic 2 forget you ever heard of Gothic 3! Run now while you have the chance!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Two Worlds Replica.   I figured with so many good reviews I would give this a run.  I have to say I am glad I bought it on a holiday sale.  Graphics are poor, dialog is god aweful,  and the game play is very poor.  The mechanics of the game are just not there.  Drink a potion ... sheath your weapon and drink ...your still getting mauled then draw your weapon.    While I understand the dev figured you cant drink a potion while in combat or if you have a sword and board.  What if you only had  1 sword.  I shouldnt have to stop put my weapon away drink then draw my weapon again.  Summon Spells break the game.  Summoned Skelly army only to be attacked by everyone.  Cant despawn them either.   So they run rampant killing everyone who attackes them then I get accused of murder.  While its pretty funny the first camp or two it does get a bit old when I cant complete quests because my summons killed the quest giver.  So save your money an pass this one up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Eight minutes in, and the game's barely started. In fact after eight minutes the loading screen and opening cinimatics finally complete. At which point the tutorial begins. or rather, when what should be the tutorial begins. What actually happens is a couple pop up windows appear to barely explain the fact you have hotbars and use wasd to move. No mention is made of how to target an enemy or how to actually attack. This is during a pitched battle where you are taking damage, not a controlled setting where the player can learn the controls safely.Then when you try attacking something, you instead sit down. How do you stand back up? Don't know, it doesn't explain. Is this because of that attack that hit you? Again it's never explained. How do you do anything now that you're sitting on the ground... in the middle of a battle? It doesn't explain, and trying every key on the keyboard and mouse does nothing. Why are you fighting these beings? Once again, you don't know cause nothing's been explained at all.The story might be amazing later on. But I don't know, the game's stuck with me sitting during a heated battle right after the opening cinimatic. All in all, I'd say Gothic 3 is a huge failure.			",30,4,0,9,5,1,4

												Horrible garbage with no chance of redemption. A complete letdown in every sense of the word. You are incapable of doing anything because enemies can and will attack you repeatedly without breaks until you die. You will be unable to progress throughout the game because you literally cannot attack or parry anything in the first 2 minutes of the game (where there is a giant battle scene). The worst part is that I can't determine what are bugs and what is just awful programming by lazy stupid developers. I wish I could get the time I wasted on this game back.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I paid for the working game and not a glitched out steam version.

												The game looked interesting but looks can be deceiving. Controls were clunky and unresponsive. I was unable to attack or defend. It simply would not work. I'd press buttons and my character would stand there slack jawed and drooling until one of the creatures finally knocked my weapon from my hand. I stared mournfully at it, unable to pick it back up. Having disarmed me the creature moved in and knocked me to the ground. I attempted to get back on my feet and......nothing. I tried again but apparently my character decided it was a good time take a nap. Eventually I was able through some inscrutable arcane means able to get back up. Noticing I had a ranged weapon option I drew that. Success! And we're back to drooling so I ran around pretending to shoot things while going pewpewpew. This was not very satisfying. I think my character might have died of boredom if I had continued to play much longer. Then it dawned on me. It's a cleverly designed punching bag simulator! Starring your character as the punching bag. I noticed from the screenshots the game has dinosaurs in it. Alas, I will not be able to recreate that scene from Jurassic Park where everyone is being chased by the T-Rex. The camera controls worked but they were as clunky as the rest of the game.The only upside to this experience has been the confirmation that Steam's refund option works flawlessly. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For me, playing Gothic 3 was a lot like owning an old pair of underwear. On its own, it's nothing impressive. But put it over your head, and you can be the life of the party for a total of 10 minutes, at the expense of your dignity and sanity, leaving you to question ""Why am I doing this again?"" and remembering you're in too deep to stop now.  After all, Gothic 3 can be a great time sink when your eyes and ears are covered. Sure, it's deceptively fun while it lasts, but it'll leave you feeling a sense of remorse when the party ends.I'm not game to play it without the community patch from the reviews I've seen, and judging of what I've played so far. All things considered, I enjoyed exploring for the most of it, given I would deliberately have to ignore awkward camera controls, occassionally frustrating optimisation, half-arsed animation and a game-breaking mountain jumping option. The last offender, when I discovered you could stumble upon end-game with ease detered me from playing. Overall, got my kicks out of it, but I wouldn't say Gothic 3 holds up as a decent game in this age.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rarely have I played a game that was in such bad shape even after the community stepped in to 'patch' the problems it has. Just... wow. Gothic series has always had its problems. Sure, it has a cult following and it does have its moments, but for the most part, it's mediocre at best. The dialogue in all 4 games is insufferable, the controls are base, the combat is painful to the point where the way your character handles himself in combat situations is why you fail rather than because you were bested, the quests are confusing and the character animations look like they were done for a highschool project. The main character you play as is just some forgettable average bearded muscle-bound man. He's bland. The end of his description.I received a quest to kill bandits along the coast. Great, sounds pretty normal, right? No. The area on the map I was pointed to confused me. It made it look like I had to go along the coast but the coast ends into a cave with goblins. Wrong area. So I figure I should swim around. Nope. Okay, backtrack and go inland, maybe there's a path to the edge of the cliff on the coast. Never found it. I get into fights with wolves along the way. They just NON-STOP lunge at me until I die. You have to wait for your hit animation to play out before you can react (Dark Souls...) which leaves you open to attack for a ridiculous amount of time. During that time, they repeat their attacks until you are dead. You have to cheese EVERY ENEMY in the game. There is no strategy to be had. Even when I turned on the Community Patch Alternative AI, it didn't change anything. Blocking became more effective but the claims in the patch notes that it made combat more sensible were false. None of the enemies behaved any differently. I switched back and forth with the AA and it did nothing that made a difference.It makes no sense that combat is basically me slamming the left mouse button and my character swishes his sword left and right like a dainty ballerina - some effeminate clown that is afraid of the sword he's wielding. You just move forward slightly, barely swinging the sword over and over. That's combat. It also gets you stuck inside obstacles if you're not careful.The game is also insanely unstable. I'm using a machine that can run Watch Dogs in its terribly unstable state on ultra settings with 60 fps and Gothic 3 saw me running at 40 fps with constant drops and hitching. The entire world is exposed so you have to dynamically load static objects, scripts and textures on the move. Every 2-3 minutes of walking leads to a pause for about 3-5 seconds where the game is trying to load the new area. Even when I am walking around a small area, I still get framerate hiccups that make me feel like I'm back on my Dell Dimension 2400. Gothic 2 didn't have these performance problems which means they didn't learn anything between that game and 3. Even Arcania: Gothic 4 has the same performance problems! I had to force Vsync in Gothic 3 and 4. What the hell is going through a game designers head when they decide a game DOESN'T need vsync?...Gothic 3 is unplayable. The story is dumb, the character names make me cringe, the quests make no sense, the performance is upsetting, the combat is painful and the entire experience made me feel like I wasted the $2.49 the game cost on sale when I got it. It's so bad, I feel like I wasted 2 and a half dollars. I feel like this game has put a dent in my mental stability. Do NOT buy this game, it's a dreadful experience. The only positive thing I can say about it is the concept. The idea of being able to go anywhere, talk to anyone, kill anyone, take anything and have real consequences that the player will have to deal with is great. The execution was like watching the Grumpy Cat movie.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First steam game to ever crash my computer.  Other than that, cheap death after cheap death will remind you of the era of nintendo gaming that caused the invention of the rage-quit.  The combat system is one of the worst I've ever seen, bad guys back up constantly and frustratingly with every swing, the best way to engage anyone is to attack them against a wall.  You may see your arrow hit dead center, but don't worry, you didn't hit them.  Potions take a lifetime to drink if you're fighting someone.  If you face two of anything and there is a hill or other obstacle there is a good chance that you should run or at least position yourself in a way that nothing is at your back, as a cheap death may be in your future.  Some chests are completely off limits and important, maybe one of a kind shopkeepers will attack you to the death over touching them with no warning, most others have no consequences for taking their contents, there is no way to tell the difference.  Selling things to shopkeepers is even annoying, I put all the junk I wanted to sell in the window, pressed sell, it instantly gave the guy everything for free.  My first sales experience in Gothic 3.  It was probably my fault, I guess you have to move the coins you want over manually from the shopkeeper, but it was not something that added to the charm of the game after being murdered by a pair of THE WEAKEST OPPONENTS IN THE GAME against a hill in a way that made me unable to swing my sword once.  Anyone who says this is 'better than skyrim' needs their head examined or a time machine back to a time would have actually been a triumph instead of a tragedy.For masochists only.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do not buy this game, not even if it's on sale. People say it's the best RPG in the world, even better than Skyrim because it has such an amazing, large and deep world to play with. That may be! Except the combat mechanics are literally the worst I've ever had to endure in a video game. Melee combat is horrific. When you try to block an attack it's 50/50 whether it'll actually block it or not. It's not supposed to be 50/50 - if you block it's supposed to block - but the game is so buggy it doesn't always register. You can't tell when an enemy is going to attack because animations are so stiff and poorly done, so it's almost impossible to know when to block. The enemy, on the other hand, will block all your attacks with total efficiency. If you want to play as a melee character, this leaves you with no choice but to approach an enemy and furiously mash the left mouse button to attack over and over and hope you win, which is 50/50. Quite often the enemy will hit you and make you stumble, putting you in what I call a ""death spin"" which you can't get out of. This is where the enemy keeps stunning you with each hit, meaning you can't retaliate and eventually die.Furthermore, the game is buggy as hell. Even with the community patch this game is horrendously buggy. I had to restart 3 or 4 times to get past the first part because after I had killed all the enemies in the little village (by furiously mashing the left mouse button because there's nothing else you can do) because you have to talk to this guy to advance the story afterwards, except when I tried to talk him he just said ""talk later"". After 3 or 4 restarts he finally talked to me.Archery is even worse. All you have to do is stand on a spot that breaks the enemy AI (which is basically on any kind of rock or tree stump because the AI is awful) and the enemies will begin slowly walking away from you because they have no way of getting to you. So you can wipe out nests of 100 goblins by standing on a rock, even though under normal circumstances 2 or 3 at once would be a challenge.I can't recommend this game. It's absolutely awful.

												You'd better get used to manually saving as much as you can because this game will never do it for you. Forget to save for 25 minutes and got killed? Have fun replaying those 25 minutes! You'd also better get used to being killed due to horrible combat, some of the worst a first person RPG has ever seen.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really?  No one's reviewed this game yet?  Most die-hard fans of the Gothic series (Gothic 1,2 and Risen 1) wouldn't include Gothic 3 as a legitimate successor to the throne of Gothic.   Then again, there are fans who love and swear by it, offering mods to make up for the many bugs found in the original.  My comments here are strictly on playing the game.  It tries, is the best I can say.  I've played and beaten Gothic 3 at least four times, so I have an educated opinion to share.   The story is long and drawn out, the world huge, and the time it takes to discover new places for quests can be frustrating, like transversing endless desert sand dunes with a crummy map that doesn't offer much help.   Fighting doesn't have the same gritty feel as this game's predecessors.   When even a whimpy enemy knocks you down, you can die trying to regain footing.  I found that frustrating.   SPOILER ALERT:Perhaps my greatest gripe, apart from the many bugs, is the meaningless quests you are sent on.  Quests to free cities of Myrtana and neighboring regions, quests to reclaim the twelve chalices, quests to obtain the relics of Adonos, to open the five temples, on and on.  You could easily spend a hundred hours racing around jumping through all these hoops--but in terms of beating the game, they really have no meaning and are useless!  I saw a youtube video that you can forget all those quests and simply kill the two kings who represent Innos and Beliar, take their magic staffs, and escape into the unknown with Xardas.  I did that myself.  Which turns my hundreds of hours wasted into maybe 60 minutes of gameplay.   All for what?    Whenever I'm tempted to play the game, I quit, recalling the countless hours it takes running from here to there, following the tasks whatever faction you choose to allign with.  Gothic 1, 2 and Risen 1 were definitely made so the quests meant something: at least you were advancing to the end.  With Gothic 3, gameplay is mostly smoke and mirrors.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's an ok game.The game worked ok for me, though when turning around as it loads the different environment it seems to lag a bit.Combat animations are very lazy, the same sword slash motion is used when weilding a spear. Looks very strange to swing a spear in the left right slash animation, a spear should have a thrusting animation of it's own. And the weapon hitting doesn't make a sound.Thought I didn't like the game, but I keep returning and wanting to play.  But now after 32 hours of game play the game is frustrating me, with vague quest descriptions causing me to wander in circles and then alt tabbing out of the game to do a search for how to complete quests, I end up with a black screen and crtl alt delete doesn't work and have to manually shut down after the black screen. Don't waste your time playing this. AVOID at all costs.I'd rate the game 3/10  not a game I'd recommend. A waste of time even if it was free.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I want to play this game so badly. It is literally UNPLAYABLE! yes i know, there is a community patch but obviously i cant install it correctly but I shouldnt have to in the first place! I spent my hard earned money to play this game and they sell it like this??!! Im not the most computer savy individual admittingly but when I, again, spend my HARD EARNED MONEY on a game, I should at least have the pleasure of playing it. This is unacceptable and should be taken off the store until it comes with the patch already installed or steam links you to the patch with actual F'ing directions on how to properly install the patch.

												This game is fantastic. It only runs in slow motion like it's been incredibly poorly optimized for modern processors. Now I don't have a godly PC, but I run Skyrim and other far more taxing games at a high frame rate than this game. And from Googling it, it seems that other people with godly PCs have trouble getting this to run any faster than a snail's pace.So if you LOVE unoptimized and poorly coded games, buy this.Now if you hate lag and graphical issues, stay away. But I mean, why would anyone?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Even if I enjoy the game the reason I am giving a negative  because the game is repetitive and all gets the same ,just doing the same things over and ove again The beginning is ok, and after some hours it is fine, but after you play many more you already figured out the  game.There are  like all those cities in the game many of them , you have to go into every single one to do quests, and to be trusted whit Orks, then you have to kill them and take back the cityAnd do that like 30 times,whit all of the cities as many as there are cities, but gets boring after like 3-4 cities And from like first minute you no where the last guy is .... Really no brainer game  All quests are boring and really stupid and no point, go get that, fight that ,pick up that ,bring back ,no point for the future game enemies are not getting stronger only I am,worst systam i ever so i a RPG , so now I am level 30, and if a im going into a BIG city ,i easy kill  EVERYONE there, no challenge what so ever any more. I was really really expecting so much more from this from what I heard from all this year, but it ended up disappointed :/ overall, will recommend this game only if you really like gothic games, I only played the 4 one, that was amazing, so mutch bether than this one The only interesting thing here is no like quest helper, so you have to find all by yourself and use the map and compas . really sad ...

It is broken you can't pass the first part of the game it won't let you attack no matter how much you click.  So you end up dying instantly because you can't fight back.

												One of the worst games mechanic wise I have ever seen, it's just not even playable.  I'm baffled how the reviews are so positive when you can't even start playing the game.  After dying about 20 times in the first fight, right out of the gate, without so much as a decent story of why I'm fighting a band of orcs, I figure out two things.  One, blocking does nothing.  Two, whoever in a fight starts swinging first wins.  So, combat goes like this.  Ease in, wait for the right moment MASH THE CRAP OUT OF THE MOUSE BUTTON UNTIL TARGET IS DEAD.  If you fail, you get killed because they did the same to you, AI speaking.  But no fear, death only lasts a couple seconds then you stand up again with 15% health.  Of course you dropped your sword, so you have to go find that and pick it up, open inventory, put in quickslot, close inventory, press key to draw sword, and of course because the game at no point pauses in all this you likely die as soon as you get the sword back out again if not before.  Start process over, hope you can get the sword out, and win the next button mash contest.  Abysmal, unplayable, absurd.  Seriously, how has anyone ever played this??			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I cannot say enough bad things about this game, I didn't play long but I was excited to check the game out and was ready to get into it but instead I was sorely dissapointed.  The game starts off in a huge battle - the sounds of combat are insulting to any person with ears.  The sounds are mostly awful grunts ""ooh"" ""ahh"" ""ooh"" ""ting"" ting"" and combat seems to be all about hitting harder and hitting first leaving almost no intelligent challenge to combat.  While the animation in this game isn't the worst you could ask for the movements of the characters are incredibly awkward and take me out of the game.  If the combat is going to look this awful and be so awkward to control they should've just used a turn based combat system or something. I feel like this game wasn't nearly finished when it was released and still isn't now.  Leaves a lot to be desired.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game won't let your mouse take control over your character's camera controls and attack. It uses only keyboard(that sucks) and the  camera control view is just Q(left) and E(Right). While confronting an opponent you are doing AFK. Lastly, one more thing, the game is laggy AF. It's just a bad game to buy it.

												Тот самый случай, когда посредственную игру не исправляет ничего. Она вышла сырой и недолепленной, и сколько бы патчей и модов кто бы на нее ни лепил - игра осталась все той же Гэ 3. Отсутствие сквозного связного сюжета, ярких, запоминающихся персонажей, спорная графика, кривая физика - все на местах. А посему - даже и не пробуйте. Одно из моих самых жестоких разочарований в мире компьютерных игр, наравне с TES IV Oblivion.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It might be that I would recommend for this game, if I had a chance to play it. I started a new game and for some reason it doesn't recognise mouse input during gameplay. Apparently this can be fixed by downloading some stuff, but you know what when I pay for something I expect it to work. If you're using W10 I would strongly suggest not buying this on any of the others unless you enjoy spending hours trying to get them working.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												DO NOT BUY! This game is broken and useless. You might as well start tossing darts at your screen, because that's the only way this is going to be an actual, playable game. I'm reasonably certain that the positive reviews came from people living in another dimension. Mouse buttons are mapped but totally unresponsive, and the controls that DO work are garbage. Learn from my mistake, save your money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What can I say? A cheap buggy piece of ****. I bought the collection in the sale because the game looked good. I was wrong. I can't even get past the tutorial because I was hit and wouldn't get back up. When i first launched it, it crashed and covered half of my PC screen and I couldn't shut it off.Don't buy this. There's a million other cheaper games that are way better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Imagine that you order a kebab with lamb meat and spicy sause but instead you get an old slice of bread with ketchup splattered on it. When you complain, you hear: ""tough luck, because I just quitted this job. What you gonna do now, sucker?"" That's how it is to play Gothic 3. The game is awful, even with Community Patch. Most of it is unfinished and/or broken. You killed an undead dragon? Well, that was on Khorinis. On the mainland even a simple wolf is stronger than you. A ""cowardly"" goblin with a pointed stick will ignore your shield parry and send you flying on a parabolic arc, because reasons. the fighting system is much worse than in previous games of the series. I reached level 17 and still the only thing that couldn't kill me in literally 5 seconds was a hare. Technical issues? Long loading times plus 90% chance of game crashing to desktop after loading a save. Foliage flickering like a disco ball (inducing headaches) or disappearing completely. Textures disappearing. Graphical glitches forcing you to save and load (and pray for not getting another crash). Unjustified fps drops. Music stopping playing abruptly to start playing again- for 5 seconds.Other things: bad dialogs and voice acting. Ugly creature and NPC models (why shadowbeast suddenly got 2 meter long spikes on it's back??). Rather dull quests. The plot itself is simply not engrossing. In 13 hours of gameplay nobody asked me ""what do you thing about it?""- only: go there, do that, tell me when you're ready.Just forget about this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This was not one of the games I wanted from that bundle but the concept and look of the game did intrigue me.... however everytime my character is forced to the ground he becomes, well A ♥♥♥♥ING POTATO!!! He doesn't move just sits there like he's been♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by the hulk and the only thing keeping his insteines from falling out his canoe sized ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is sitting still. To say in a more polite matter my character doesn't move once he has been kicked to the ground.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Honestly didn't play the game much. Started with the lackluster tutorial where I walked around smacking down orcs and stealing my neigbors' stuff. Nothing groundbreaking but not really fun. Still, maybe it just starts slow.Here's the ♥♥♥♥♥. In the middle of the tutorial, attempting to click on a chest and steal my neighbor's stuff, I accidentally clicked on his bed instead. (That's not the problem. That was totally me being clumsy, not the game's fault). My character walks towards the bed, but there's a chest in the way. You'd think he'd path around it, right? No, the dumbass walks up to the interveneing chest then just keeps on walking against it dry humping it for all he's worth.Does he eventaully path around it?  NODoes he eventually stop? NOIf I mash every key on my keyboard, will it cancel his action and make him stop? NOCan I bring up the menu to try and save my game and reload? NONo, he's so damned determined to frotteurize that poor helpless chest that he, and the game with him are blind to the world. Unlike it's crappy older brother though, I CAN Ctrl-ALT-DEL out of the game.Was it good enough to re-invest that 25 minutes? NOIs it likely that the rest of the game is programmed perfectly and I just hit the only game-breaking bug in the whole game 2 minutes in? NOAm I willing to play the game in a constant state of paranoia, saving before every action in case this kind of crap is pervasive? NOAm I glad I only spent $5 on the entire (so far completely unplayable) Gothic Series? YES!!!Am I sick and tired of buying games on Steam that someone at steam should have at least made an effort to QC? DOUBLE YES!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Pros:-Beautiful world, lots to explore-Everything is voice acted, but  very poorly compared to g1 & 2cons:-Very simple dull combat -Armor just docent look or make you feel badass compared to G1 & 2 -Really buggy -Voice acting is♥♥♥♥♥♥(is gorn voice acted by a white guy?)-The changed all the characters that got on the boat with you at the end of G2, the voice acting is no were near what they were and they changed the armor of them so much that if their name was not above their heads you could not tell it was them.-Character models just look plain silly, some character's heads just look way to small for their body. This game would be playable an enjoyable if they combat was not so damn boring and simple. If you liked G1 & 2 you will probably be disappointed with this game. 4/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I remember the day when Gothic 3 was releasing. It was something big and huge happening. Also not many PCs could run it in those days. So many of my friends bought a new PCs because of this game. I tried a pirate version to check if my PC will handle with this. This game was awesome !! Something fresh and new. Gamestyle, textures ...After over 11 years since that day I bought this game on Steam sale to take the same, cool and awesome trip like in 2006. Nope, this game has a lot of bugs (expecialy mouse issues), is lagging (where PCs are 5 times better) and it is boooring as hell.

												Warning none of these game work right  Gothic 1 and 2 is just a way to sale the game they won't even work on newer window and 3 the key that are set don't work for some reson even when you reset them, you can not trust this game site to fix any thing all they do is let you look through endless decussions trying to find an answer when it should be an easy way to get help... look at all reviews and if they have no thumbs down it's allso not trust worthy hidden bad post to sale the game.... some reson the gaming associtation is allowing such trickery and this is unkown so buy games at your own risk... I'm not saying that steam is involved but they sure don't seem to help much and i wish this was not true because i like this site but hate it do too a lot of my game have issue not being fixed... I think all fix and issue should be in easy access so you can fine them any ways this game that works now in bata 1.75 fixs issue but it still not that fun i have no block and die easy do to moving way to slow to even battle enemy and other game play issue like i said bad reveiws are not posted like this one which is a waist of our time...

												I'm playing now in 2015 with the community patch and the game is awesome.Being a big fan of the Gothic and Risen series this is the only game that I didn't have owned yet.I had read so many bad reviews that always kept me away from it. I decided to revisit and I startedreading again about it and I found out about a community patch that fixes most of the bugs.I gave it a try and I can't imagine I'm enjoying this game so much. I hardly noticed of any bugs. Maybe the story is not as awesome as in Gothic 2, but the rest is just better. The game has everything a classic RPG you can expect. I'm not going to go into detail, but if you like Gothic 1&2 and Risen, get this one with the community patch. You won't regret. Once you get into it, it's so hard to stop playing!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Second time my characater just sat down on the ground with nearly full health and refused to do anything else while the orcs killed everyone around him.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is better than the reviews it gets. While the combat is pretty awful, the story is pretty good and if you like to adventure around at will this is the game for you. The graphics are decent and very acceptable for its time. This game requires a little getting used to but is overall very worth getting if you like exploring and a good story.

												A lot of fans from the previous Gothic games would not have enjoyed Gothic 3 as much as the previous titles. However this game is not all that bad it is actually very good. The soundtrack to this game is very beatiful. It can go from a peaceful sounding stroll in the forest to a harsh drum banging as you getting ready to fight a group of orcs or a pack of wolves. The graphics are not too bad, the game has aged well. The story is pretty good. There are lot's of side quests allowing for you to plummet lot's of hours into it. The only complaint would be how magic in this game isn't a very sustainable class. Other than that if your are interestd in this game and haven't played the previous titles you will probably enjoy this game a lot.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A solid old school hack and slash open world rpg. Its leveling / skill systems has its roots firmly in old pen and paper roleplays. Has a novel stamina based combat system. A decent game engine certainly helps with some nice hdr and depth of field effects that make it a pretty world to explore. A fair bit of replay value to be found. I can spend months at a time playing games like this though.4/5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of, you need unnoficial path. Tx for steam for pre applying 1.6. But 1.74 is the way to go.This game is the successor of G2 the masterpiece, in this series the world is more livid and large, the exploration is veeery challenging and dangerous.The history is inferior to Gothic2 and playing G3 without playing the ancestors can make you curious about some NPC's.A good game, i spent lots of quality time and frustration playing it.Recommended, sometimes out of the box is needed in RPG scenario.Unfortunately the performance of the game is not optimal, so be prepared for some shuttering.

												So I played this game many years ago when it first came out (Like a lot of others I assume) back then the game was shambles, the bugs outweighed the fun it offered. So I gave up on it and it took me till 2016 to give it another go. I have to say if you install the 1.75 ""beta"" test patch its moreorless bug free to a point that it feels like the game it should have been when it was released. The game has a lot of merits which are sadly lost mostly in time due to its terrible launch, the story is interesting and the content is massive. I was impressed with just how many quests and towns there was. However like every game there was a couple of things that still annoyed me, the usual voice changes (Not as drastic as Forsaken Gods thankfully). Also the rebranding of your friends Gorn is now White so is Vatras, also it felt like Vatras was talking to you like he had only just met you when in reality he sailed in on your ship lol. But if we put them minor points aside I think this game is a lot of fun and very much worth buying (If you install the 1.75 patch).Although I still rate Gothic 2 over it, it comes in a close 2nd. 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Update 1: After a few more hours in, I may be rethinking my review...still gonna keep playing to see what happens, but the game moves very slowly, and the clunky combat controls and physics are a huge problem. It really makes the game irritating to play for more than an hour at a time, and that really isn't a good thing at all. I really hope this gets going. I just unlocked two-handed weapons, and crossbows, hoping that the extra damage would help, but two-handed weapons are so ungodly slow that you literally cannot hit an enemy with them unless you get extremely lucky. The crossbow is nice, but it is also, in some ways, broken. I can shoot enemies from far enough away that they cannot see me, and thus do not attack me...At this point, 7.0/10.If it doesn't start gaining points soon, it is going to be another title I never complete, and I'll eventually have to give it the thumbs down.Original: Seems pretty decent so far...only played a few hours at this point. I do have beef with the controls, though. This game isn't particularly difficult at this point, at least in terms of the strength of the opponents this early on, but the controls make it way too easy to die against fairly low-ranking mobs.The community patch 1.75 is necessary -- game was 100% unplayable before getting that patch. Pre-patch, my character wouldn't even stand up after being knocked down, the mouse did not function -- as in turning the view required either using Q and E, or wildly swinging the mouse back and forth a dozen times before the game realized it existed. Those issues were fixed with the community patch.As to my current disappointment with the controls -- really, it is just the combat controls. First thing, it takes this dude about 4 seconds to swing a sword for a power attack, and about two seconds for a regular attack. Even a small child can swing a sword toward an object faster than that. Second, blocking does nothing against mobs, only against opponents who also have weapons. Third, it takes this dude FOREVER to draw a bowstring. I have only shot a bow a couple times, and it ain't that hard. You'd think someone with combat experience could do it faster. Fourth, and last, you can't swing down at something below you if you are on a hill -- essentially, anything that is on a portion of ground where the plane is a foot or two below yours can only be hit with a bow...or probably spells. Only have two spells right now, and neither do damage, so I'm not sure about that.So, my call at this point is that it would have been awesome had they made the combat more ""realistic,"" and had the difficulty of the game come through in the intelligence of the enemies, instead of it simply being difficult because the combat controls and physics are somewhat sub-par. Granted, it is a slightly older game, but that isn't a very good excuse. As it is, ""tricking"" your opponents makes killing them incredibly easy. All you have to do is find an object that they can't climb, which is anything since none of them appear to have the ability to jump, and pelt them with arrows until they die. If they have a bow and are shooting at you, you just have to strafe back and forth as they shoot at you. They never hit you.I do recommend it at this point, because it seems like it is going to develop into a really good game, but I will always dislike the combat and AI systems.So far, 7.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought Gothic 3 after reading several recommendations about the game which focused on the open world - nature of the game and the leveling system as positives. I had no experience of the series, but it drew me in with its atmosphere and skill based sword-and-shield combat.As a standalone-experience from the Gothic series I quite enjoyed the game's progression, taking my time to explore the map and liberating towns after raising my level, moving through weaker enemies with ease. At higher levels it feels satisfying to take on a crowd of enemies that you could only barely defeat at the beginning of the game. The game is long but you find yourself traveling around, not getting bored of the same locations. Gaining new skills and abilities in the game is handled exclusively through various tutors thorough the game world, and this system is brilliant in its simplicity.The melee combat system consist of strong, slow attacks and weaker but faster attacks mixed with power attacks and thrusts. To get anywhere with using melee weapons rhytm and timing of movements need to be perfect, and after learning the behaviour of the different enemies the combat became my favourite part of the game. I can't really judge the other combat styles however.As for negatives, even with the available community patch enemies may sometimes deal unexpectedly high damage out of a sudden, leaving you to continue from your last quicksave. The game's story is also up to the player to piece together, leading to a rather sudden start for the game. The game has crashed for me two or three times during 70+ hours. There is a lot to nickpick about the game, for which if you really want to read about check the negative reviews on steam.For a discounted price at least (2,99 € for me) the game is worth a try for anyone interested in trying an interesting RPG classic. Essential:  Community patch & View distance fixhttp://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2671041

												Had been a pretty big fan of the first two Gothic games, but steered away once hearing of the problems with bugs. Finally decided to pick it up last sale as I figured both Skyrim and Witcher 3 are well known for their bugs too. (I needed to console hack Skyrim in order to keep the thief quest line from bugging and resetting). Just like Skyrim needs community patches, so does Gothic 3 and in my experience I had no major issues here like I did with Skyrim.I also have to say Gothic 3 is a better PC experience out of the box than Skyrim; which needs SkyUI to come close to functioning as a PC game as well as a hotbar addon which none of them worked quite right. Gothic 3 has a hotbar built in so you never need to be bothered by constantly going in and out of menus. For instance, towards the end of my play I'd throw out some ice spears, freeze people, pull out my bow and finish them off, kite away, toss back some healing and mana pots, throw some more ice spears, take out my sword and hack away the rest. In both Skyrim and Witcher series (which are console experience games) you'd be constantly be going in and out of menus to get all of that done. Gothic is a very seamless experience that I really appreciate.It's a shame that the game was rushed out of release and never received the polish it deserved. At it's core is a really great game, but there are annoying issues. I think I ran into two instances where voice audio was missing from the dialog and one or two other instances where the dialog was spoken by the wrong person. Also it's pretty annoying that if you've got a sword and shield equipped, then use your pickaxe, that your shield doesn't get re-equiped. Still, I'd take that bug anyday over going in and out of pause menus just for a single fight.I got over 70hrs of gameplay out of it which is what you'd expect and I really rushed the end of the game. After I learned that the developers moved on to make the Risen series I've just been wanting to finish out the game so I could play a game that they were given the time to finish.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Another one of my favorite games. I have been playing this game since 2010. I got it from a pc magazine. This game has its own atmosphere/feel/world and great music. The leveling system is spot on, the quests are interesting and the reputation system makes choices matter. The mage build is a bit grindy at times but a hunter (my personal choise) is amazing. Skin your own prey, get trophies like glands, teeth, claws and much more. The main quest is engaging and makes you want to explore the entire map. By the way, the map is humongous and has its own climate zones. But, I think the combat system is not the best for example fighting a pack of wolves with a sword is the worst idea, you can't block attacks from animals even with a shield. But when you get a bow or get training in crossbows and get one. They are easy to handle. Overall I think if you want to experience the game like it should be experienced you should get the community patch 1.75 it is thanks to the community, that we have a stable game with widescreen options, new smarter A.I. and much more, huge thanks to them.  10/10 from me.

												Don't be fooled by the lack of hours, I downed an unhealthy amount of time into this game, and I can definitely say it is an acquired taste. The learning curve is steep and unforgiving with both newcomers and veterans alike. To give you an idea, a pack of wolves can absolutely tear you down at level 60, liberating towns from orcs will require at least hundreds of quickloads, and fighting enemies uphill or on a sloped terrain is a suicide pact.Nonetheless, if you take your time with this game, you will realize it's one of the best RPGs ever made.(just make sure to install the community patch v 1.75, the game is almost unplayable without it)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
