												Having sunk over 200 hours into this game alone, over 500 hours in total for this whole trilogy how can I not say this is one of the greatest adventures I've had ever in my life. This is not just a game that you play like call of duty just to pass the time, this series has become a religious experience, a lifestyle.When I first loaded up this game I had no idea what I was in for, but it gave off a seriously special energy and I got sucked into a living, breathing universe...full of wonder, full of excitement and it shook me like Star Wars KOTOR never could (and is the reason why and how I even bought this game). Don't even think is this game going to be good enough for my $20 (Australia), if you can afford it just buy it and open your heart, mind and soul to this amazing experience. Don't listen to the haters crying about there ME3 endings that they never got etc, its the journey, the friendships you create, the relationships you forge, the hearts you can break, the tears that can be shed. Don't miss out.Love you Bioware, you have turned my world and my views, my inner essence, my personality upside down, inside out and blown it to hell and back (in a good way). You've made me mad, you've made me sad, made me happy, made me cry, made me scream the roof down. How many games can you get emotionally, psychologically and spiritually attached to.Games are artwork like paintings and music for this technological generation, this game is a work of art.

												I'll be honest and admit that I very rarely finish the games that I purchase. I usually play them until I get bored or see something else that grabs my attention.Not Mass Effect. I've finished all of these games several times, ME2 probably being the best of the bunch. They are all good and well worth playing. I'm a 35 yr old physician and I was waiting in line with teenagers at midnight for the release of ME2 and ME3 at Gamestop. I had a great time. 10/10 Would debate Miranda's cup-size with emo hoodlums again			",50,3,0,11,2,0,9

												Favorite game of all time.Awful inventory system, didn't really care about the combat system, couldn't care less about upgrades, weapons, etc, graphics are fine for its time, BUT...But if you are a fan of epic science fiction stories (Dune, Hyperion, etc) as I am, with the vast, diverse and interesting worlds and species and their relationships to each other along with an ominus evil lurring to destroy the galaxy, then BY GOD this is the game for you.Great characters, a plethora of game-changing choices, awesome antagonist, amazing story, incredible dialogue... Simply excellent. I cannot recommend this enough.			",111,17,2,9,3,0,7

												Mass Effect is a sci-fi shooter with a great storyline and characters that I grew fond of, as if they were really my squad members. I fell in love with this game with time as the story and characters developed, I've never played any game like it, and I highly doubt any other sci-fi game series could be as awesome as Mass Effect. It is truly unique and very enjoyable to play. Give it a try!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Punched a reporter.10/10 would punch again.In all seriousness, Mass Effect is a well-rounded game from BioWare, the people that defined my childhood with such classics as Neverwinter Nights, and my all-time favorite, Knights of the Old Republic.This first step into the trilogy, puts you into the boots of Commander Shepard. He (or she) is given the task of stopping a rogue Spectre from... you guess it, taking over the galaxy (OF COURSE!) Along the way, you pick up a colorful cast of characters that help Shepard every step of the way.One of the things I really like about Mass Effect is its approach to morality. It is not the standard good vs evil choice. To put this in Star Trek terms, Paragon Shepard is more like Jean-Luc Picard or Kathryn Janeway, always willing to go for diplomacy first. Conversely, Renegade Shepard is more analogous to Benjamin Sisko; doing whatever it takes to get the job done, and sometimes crossing the line. But even though ReneShep may cross that line, he or she, is willing to live with the decision regardless of the consequences.Gameplay may seem a little archaic especially when compared to the later games in the trilogy, but there is something about it that I find charming in its design. Sure, inventory management can be a bit of a hassle, but let's face it, no game has ever really had a perfect inventory system. The shooting is solid enough, even though the guns sound like pea shooters (This only applies to the pistols. The shotguns, and sniper rifles have weight to their sound assets), and the variety of ammunition types, equipment and powers allow for a lot of replayability. Plus, you can take your completed Shepard, and import him or her into the next two games, taking your decisions with you.So, what about Shepard? Take a seat, relax, and begin your journey to find out.			",125,5,0,14,5,0,19

The story is deep, serious ♥♥♥♥. You like galactic, cyberpunk stuff that reminds you of swtor? Play this, it's so precise, voice acting for every moving thing, storyline has so much attention to detail, especially the characters, they DIFFER so much from each other, and it continues to develop and evolve as the series continues. Music is so nostalgic, everything is ace, the film-grain effect for that retro look... People don't pay respects to these little details that the bioware team throws in. They are aware of every aspect of good storytelling, and they exploit it well in this series.Summarising stories is the worst way to fish someone into what you're selling, won't want to make them play it for ♥♥♥♥. If I summarized the storyline it would be; 'you are commander shepard, goal is to save the galaxy with a team' But the storyline isn't what it is about, otherwise there would be so much of the same ♥♥♥♥ in both the gaming and film industry, what really matters is how you execute it. Play this game, it will hook you in the first 3-4 hours, if it doesn't, then it isn't your thing. It's a game that isn't open-world yet offers so much freedom.PROS:+ Definitely one of the most interesting, yet complex plots out there+ Gameplay is dynamically shaped by your actions and dialogue selections+ Can go around as a total ♥♥♥♥, or an ethical and universal role model+ Epic protagonist+ Great model designs

There are games you love, and replay many times.And then there are the games which almost bring a tear to your eye every time you start them.

												Mass Effect is the template for modern games in general. It has a great story, lots of characters, good voice acting and cool gameplay. Even now, several years after its release and two sequels, it still holds up better than most games.The orginal Mass Effect has something that its succesors do not have: style ánd substance. The original has hundreds of customisation options. Skill trees are huge and you can easily invest in skills that are not entirely related to your class. It is a bit like Dark Souls in that you can still adopt to suit the situation. You are not irrevocably commited to a single style. This allows you to change things up and to keep the long quest fresh. This word: commitment. In Mass Effect 2 you would commit to romancing a partner, playing a class and upgrading some weapons. In the original, you spend way more time exploring, fighting and doing cool stuff in general, while still keeping the interactions with your team interesting enough for you to invest in them. Mass Effect is balanced in its commitments, not overly invested in one or the other. It does a lot of things right, but it certainly isn't the best in any area. However, when taken together, you get a very complete and incredible game. I admit, it may have some problems, like the Mako's gravity defying motions or the tedious shootouts in bunkers that lead to nothing but more worthless junk. However, if you cannot overlook these issues then I suggest you take step back and consider the point of exploring. Bioware has built entire planets for you to explore, and you complain about the space suit you found that happens to be too pink? You are missing the point. If gratification is what you want, then go play something else. Mass Effect is a genuine experience; something that needs to be played to be enjoyed. It isn't the result that matters, but the process.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mass Effect is an action role playing third person shooter game, developed by BioWare. Releasing on Xbox 360, PS3 and PC. The game was released in November 2007 as a timed Xbox exclusive, but eventually got ported to PC in May 2008. The game starts out with you being able to fully customize the appearance of the main character, male or female, abilities, and background story.  The game play is based a lot around a squad of three characters including you. There are six difference “classes” that come in the form of important characters that you encounter throughout the game. Each of these classes will level up, and have their own special abilities and talent tree to select from.  The talent tree is very detailed, allowing you to spec each class into specialized roles which you will take on different missions depending on what enemies you will be facing. The game’ combat system is primarily in real time, but you can pause at any time to give orders to your squad. I however found this to be a very negligible feature as I had no use for it all, I don’t think I used even once. The combat is very easy to get to grasps with. A really good cover based system is included, with some really tight controls to boot. Whilst you do have unlimited ammo for your weapons, you do run the risk of overheating your guns if you just continuously fire, meaning you have to take breaks in your onslaught for a few seconds at a time or you can simply switch to one of your many other weapons. I liked the idea behind not having to scavenge around for ammunition, its 2183…it’s all lasers for gods sakes! :)  Another key game play element comes in the form of the dialogue and morality system. A really good portion of the game takes place in dialogue scenes with NPCs, your answers really do matter and can sometimes change the course of events which carry out for the rest of the game. I am not normally a fan of games which have too much dialogue, but I was completely intrigued to explore each dialogue option to delve deeper and immerse myself completely in the story. Different actions and different results will affect your morality, completing the main missions don’t really add much to the system, but a lot of the game’s side missions make you choose a “good” or “bad” resolution to them, which really makes you think sometimes. Mass Effect is almost ten years old now, and whilst it is showing its age, it is certainly still an OK looking game by today’s standards.  All of the animations are really crisp. The textures aren’t all high resolution, but you have to remember the age of the game when playing. The facial modelling of all of the characters is done very well too, and even betters some of the recent titles! I played Mass Effect on the medium difficulty level, and I found the game to be challenging enough so that I wasn’t breezing through the game, but not so hard that I felt I wasn’t able to progress without having the need to grind a few levels before taking on a certain boss or mission. The only times I did find myself getting stuck, is purely a UI issue, rather than the gameplay. The game doesn’t do a fantastic job at telling you where to go next; you have a lot of maps to be able to look through, but no help at all comes for many of the side missions for where you need to go, meaning I had to look up a few of the missions online to be able to work out where to go. The majority of the game’s levels are really well designed. There is really only one main hub of activity in the game which has an open world feel to it, and that is the Citadel. You will find a good portion of the game’s side quests in this location with plenty of NPCs to interact with as well. Each of the game’s main missions takes place on a different planet, and that planet will also have a handful of side missions for you to complete along with the main story. I would urge people to check them out as they are well worth your time, and I didn’t at any point feel like I was completing the same type of mission over and over again. All of the side missions add a great deal of story which also keeps the lore crew happy as well. I have recently just finished my second play through of Mass Effect, the first being a few years ago now. The most recent play through of the game took just under 20 hours to complete, this is with me being in OCD mode and completing all of the side missions, exploring all of the levels and interacting with any of the NPCs I came across. There is a deal of replay ability with Mass Effect, you can of course ramp up the difficulty, but you can also play the game in different styles using the morality system, and changing the gender of your character to also effect relationships with your crew members.  I would even say I could squeeze another two play throughs out of Mass Effect before I would find it hard to find something new to come across. Technically, right now I have to say Mass Effect does have a couple of issues running on newer operating systems. Whilst I didn’t have any crashes or major bugs, I did have a few performance problems with the odd stutter every now and again. I am pretty sure it is not hardware related as my PC is more than capable of running current titles on 4k with high settings. Another pet peeve is that I wasn’t even able to run the game on 1080p; you have to put up with the lower Xbox360 resolutions. I didn’t play with a controller, as I am more interested in being more precise with my aim than anything else to be honest. My conclusion on Mass Effect is, that whilst many of you will have probably already played and finished the game, I would still class this as a must play title for our recent memory. It is the start of a truly fantastic series, and one of the standout titles of the last generation of games. It is showing its age slightly, but Sci-fi fans will want to start here before stepping foot into the Mass Effect world.  If you can look past the aging graphics you have an absolutely stellar story and hella fun gameplay with some heavy RPG elements.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

												Mass Effect starts the beginning of a saga that kept fans at the edge of their seats until 2013.  While many will argue that Mass Effect 1 is least important of the series, there is absolutely no reason not to play it.  It feels like a different game than its sequels, and only if you have played Mass Effect will you understand some of the events and consequences that take place through Mass Effects 2 and 3.  Verdict: If you are interested in this trilogy at all, do it right and start from the beginning - Mass Effect.			",166,34,3,11,13,1,36

												Ah, Mass Effect... how do I make this review and not sound the slightest biased at all?1- INTRODUCTION Mass Effect is one of those cult classic games that gained recognition due to its advertisement of being a spiritual successor to Knights of the Old Republic. To some degree, yes it is. As soon as you start the game it just screams Star Trek or at the very least any old corny 80s sci-fi TV soap opera or like some people like to call it ""a space opera"". This is definitely one of the charms of this game. It's more about talking and finding resolutions to problems rather than pulling out your plasma rifle and shooting every space-fiend you come across.2- NARRATIVE AND STORYTELLINGJust to get this out of the way, overall the voice acting in this game is great. There wasn't a moment where I went ""jeez that was... yeah"".  Although high quality voice acting is kind of already expected from a studio like Bioware. Anyways;This being the first game of the trilogy the story aspects are still based on foreshadowing while following a basic narrative focus on an objective. In this game the main objective is trying to catch a rouge Spectre (Mass Effect equivalent of a Grey Warden or Jedi) named Saren and bring him to justice for the crimes he commits during the game. Without going into spoiler territory, the game does a great job of keeping narrative cohesiveness no matter which mission order you decide to play the game in which is something dearly missed in the next two sequels that feel disjointed at times. As far as the companions go they're some of the best Bioware companions only slightly falling short of the Dragon Age cast but surpassing a lot of the KotOR cast. All in all, the storytelling in this game is great and always seems to be interesting, whether it be random chatter in the background or the actual dialogue and pacing.  3- MECHANICS Now let's get to the actual mechanics. The overall shooting in the game is above average at best. The guns feel very ""pew pew"" and have very little impact or satisfaction using. The main saving grace for the combat are the powers. Like any Bioware game, it wouldn't be complete without a pause button for tactical awareness, borrowing from the fact that Bioware usually specialize in turn-based real time games. In conjunction with all these powers and the overall shooting there is much to enjoy from the combat as it gives you a sense of command while not relying heavily on RNG and dice roll mechanics since it's a third-person shooter. What about the role-playing? Unlike previous Bioware games where you had a long list of stuff to pick they added in a dialogue wheel which would later be a staple for all Bioware games to come after DA:O. The idea is ingenious as it allows for a much more convenient experience compared to something like KotOR. As good as the dialogue wheel is the actual role-playing suffers from something I like to call ""meta thinking"", I'll elaborate on this later. Like KotOR you're presented with two sides of a black and white world, Paragon (basically Light side) and Renegade (basically Dark side). Like any RPG there's a persuasion mechanic but unlike most RPGs this persuasion mechanic isn't improved by leveling up your persuasion skill/talent etc. You have two persuasion skill trees called Charm (unlocks the blue ultra Paragon options) and Intimidate (unlocks the red ultra Renegade options.). This mechanic would be fine and all if the amount of talent points you can put into them wasn't capped by how much Paragon and Renegade points you accumulated throughout the game. This whole management of morality points just to get the best possible outcome is where this game really falls short. This talent point cap encourages you to only play as a Paragon or only play as a Renegade instead of mixing choices up for a more honest playthrough of what YOU would actually do. If you're planning on playing a mostly good guy you won't be facing most of these problems since getting Paragon points is relatively easy to the point where doing normal sidequests will randomly give you Paragon points out of thin air simply because you played the game. But if you're planning on doing a hardass/jerk/badass while still having good intentions (mostly choosing sarcastic lines while still playing for Paragon outcomes) kind of playthrough you're really going to struggle without ""meta thinking"" and planning out which options you have to be a Renegade about or a Paragon about. There were some choices I regretted doing simply because I need more imaginary morality points to advance my persuasion talent instead of actually playing the game how I wanted to play. Still, it's a little bit of a nitpick that I can't immerse myself in my character and rather go all meta and minmax what mission order I have to do.Another concern this game has is the whole Mako sequences that take place when you land on a random planet and you take control of an exploration vehicle called ""the Mako"". The physics feel odd to say the least and the planets that aren't story mission related are bland and not interesting even if the sidequests on the planet are. When you first play the game it probably won't be a problem at first but if you have played this game to death and beyond like I have these sidequest missions can be a little bit of grind since controlling the Mako up long steep hills isn't the most fun thing to do.4- RESOLUTIONDespite all the♥♥♥♥♥♥I've thrown at this game, it's still one of my favorites to replay every year or so just to re-experience the joy of how it influenced the type of entertainment I consume today. This will always remain a timeless classic in my eyes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let me preface this by saying that I played Mass Effect 2 first on the XBox Before I played Mass Effect 1 on the PC. (Exit OG ME fans and PC loyalists)Let me also say that I believe ME1 to be the better game (Exit ME2 fans).Where to begin? To start, this game is much harder than ME2. Not only is it more difficult (this coming from someone who has beaten both on Veteran difficulty as an Adept), but ME1 is harder in a better way than ME2 is hard. Let me explain: In ME1, there are situations where you can get overwhelmed by enemy numbers, but the difficulty of the encounters usually arise from having to balance tech, biotics, and guns in the right way to beat your enemies. As an adept, I found that abilities like Barrier were indispensible for any engagement because it gives me increased survivability that I can't get from armor (Adepts are restricted to Light Armor). There was a distinct feeling of tactical combat where you had to plan around your enemy's abilities (which they use more liberaly in ME1) and where your abilities seemed useful. In ME2, the difficulty arises almost exclusively from large numbers, constant gunfire, and a Shepard whose shields seem to evaporate almost instantly. Fighting any one enemy in ME2 is the same as fighting any other enemy: remove shields, barriers, and/or armor, hit them with one of the biotic abilities that ragdolls them, spray, and repeat.Another thing that jumps out from my memory is cover in both games. ME2 is a cover-based third-person shooter; to have any hope of surviving an engagement for longer than ten seconds, you MUST find cover. If you aren't close enough to target them with abilities, tough luck. ME1 has cover and incorporates it, but several times I remember the game punishing me for staying in cover for too long. I have lost track of how many times I was sniped or blown up with a rocket for taking cover at inopportune times while dangerous enemies were about. To top it off, if I faced a situation in ME2 analagous to an ME1 situation where I was punished for going into cover, ME2 would reward me by making me impervious to all damage while I wait for my health and shields to regenerate. Cover is not the catch-all solution in ME1 that it is in ME2.ME1 isn't without faults, dear reader. Preach this to the choir: ME1 is slightly uglier, the Mako sections go from ""adorable"" to ""abysmal"" real quick (and they are a sizable part of the game), large exporatory bits like the Citadel are frustrating to navigate, the inventory interface is not the best, the ""quest"" interface is equally frustrating, the gameplay is somewhat unforgiving during the late-game, and the voice acting and writing in ME2 has an edge over ME1 because ME2 has the confidence of a second iteration and it doesn't ham in nearly as much exposition about the universe. I'm sure I'm missing some things, but for all its faults, the things ripped out of the game in ME2 make my playthroughs of ME2 melancholic and boring. No **truly** heat-based weapons, no inventory on the scale of ME1, no modifying weapons on the fly, a MUCH less complex leveling system than in ME1, and the implimentation of regenerating health à la ""most mainstream shooters.""At the last, I will leave you, reader, with this anecdote: When I loaded my ME1 save in ME2 to see what Bioware had in store for people who bought the first game, it was cool to see the choices in the last game reflected in some little blurbs in the early game, but I could not get past the ""thermal clip"" that they pushed on you right out of the gate. In ME1, the fully-voiced Codex explained why reloading was unecesary due to the advent of Mass Effect technology. It was an interesting mechanic that that allowed for some interesting plays to occur, removing some technical difficulty (""I ran out of ammo and now I have to face this boss. How have I failed to arrive at this situation?"") and adding some new opportunities for meaningful difficulty (""That Asari overheated my weapon, which gave her enough time to put me in stasis, expose me, and kill me dead. How can I overcome?""). In ME2, they scrap that unique mechanic with the generic, tried and true ""bullets-in-a-magazine"" mechanic for ammo that you see in almost every other shooter. Not only is this disappointing considering what ME1 was like, but ME2 even teases you with those little blurbs that appear while loading a section of the game. One of them says something along the lines of ""Guns use thermal clips. When it overheats, eject the thermal clip and load in a new one!"" So harshly do I scream at my monitor saying ""THE GUN ISN'T OVERHEATING, THIS IS EA DEMANDING THAT BIOWARE MAKE THE GAME ""MORE ACCESSIBLE"" TO THE GENERAL MARKET!""For those of you into people, ME1 is like a kind of ugly stutterer who has these deep and interesting elements to them that make them a joy to be around. ME2 is like a charismatic, physically attractive person who has a bit of an empty head. They're cool to look at, but beyond first impressions, interactions with them get old REALLY fast, especially in light of your interactions with the ugly stutterer.Playing this game after playing Mass Effect 2 makes the sequel look like it was made for children.tl;dr: After beating both ME1 and ME2, I must say that ME1 is the better game, so buy it.

												It's hard for me to quantify in words what I liked about Mass Effect. Both back when it first released and upon retrospect.Mass Effect was a huge turning point with video games and its influence is still readily seen to this day. It marked the shift toward cinematic based games becoming the norm and allowing you to interact with the events. It influenced dialogue driven protagonists with their own dialogue trees and progression systems. And it modernized concepts Bioware previously did in Baldur's Gate like party romances. Much of this was done before in games like Kotor or Metal Gear Solid, but Mass Effect tied everything up into a neat well polished package. This was a game that blew me away when I first played it. It was truly the first 7th gen game that indicated to me where video games would eventually go. It looked amazing and I fell in love with the gameplay and all of the characters. It really was a game Bioware made in their prime.Naturally playing it today will make you notice the game hasn't aged all that well. Bioware was still transitioning from mostly making turn based games like Kotor so they didn't quite perfect the gameplay til the sequel. I still highly recommend playing Mass Effect 1. It is easily one of the last great games Bioware made.

												After doing 5 walkthroughs and reaching over 150 hours with Mass Effect I have to say this is one of the best games I have ever played. Game mechanics are mediocre at best - the cover system is not the best and managing your inventory could have been much better. But this was released for consoles back in 2007. We have come a long way in this genre since that year so let's just accept these issues as well as the somewhat dated graphics and focus on the story instead.Well, the story is all about a commander called Shepard who is tasked with capturing Saren who goes rogue and by doing so endangers the lives of many. He is from a race called Turian and is an agent of the notorious group called Spectre. Along the way Shepard discovers Saren is just a pawn in this game. He continues to uncover who exactly is in the background and the findings are interesting enough to have two more sequels for this game.The sequel focuses more on the action and the third and final episode tries to combine both. At this point you have probably heard of the controversy in connection with the ending of the trilogy. It is always nice to start with the first where there were no expectations and this is where you meet the Commander and the various races living in the galaxy. There are tons of side missions and you have your own ship to control to be able to reach the planet you desire. You meet new characters who'll join you as during each mission you control a squad consisting of 3 people. What makes Mass Effect really great is its depth! How the story unfolds and not just the main story but the story of each and every character important to Shepard's quest. From time to time you get to make decisions and these decisions can seriously affect the storyline. The personality trait you have is also very important: going with the good choices makes you a paragon in the eyes of your comrades while sticking to the darker side (you see what I did there?) renders you a renegade. A 2nd walkthrough is the minimum just for the sake of seeing what could have happened if you'd gone the other way.Mass Effect is a great game: Its storyline, music, voice acting (the female Shepard's voice is equally good), characters, art design are all top notch. You didn't like the casualness of the second part and the ending of the trilogy was a letdown for you? Grab the 1st where it all started. But this time, pick a different line in a conversation or a different class for Shepard at the beginning. Or a different background for him. Or simply complete some side missions in a totally different order. One thing is for certain: you'll find something new in your next walkthrough.			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

How would you like to command a space ship and take part in building the image of humanity for all the other aliens in the galaxy?  Basically, that's  the question, Commander Shepard, your character is asked early on in the game, asked as in obliged. This is a game developed at the time where BioWare was respecting its fanbase same as CD Projekt of today. That said, you get to play through a well written storyline, faulty combat that has its charm, original soundtrack that whenever you're going to listen to again, you're going to relive the feelings and last but not least, graphics that are today outdated, yet possible to mod with some sweet 4k textures and having a strong art style, it still got the touch.     The whole Mass Effect trilogy is remembered for it's characters, but the first one doesn't only have the memorable squad mates and NPCs, but also an original story, with the least tropes and cliches of the bunch and non-arugable, the most solid regarding plot and pace. In a galaxy where humanity is new and relatively unproven, you, Commander Shepard, get to be the first human Spectre, an agent authorized by the Council to do anything, have to catch a veteran rogue spectre, finding out his motives and putting an end to whatever he is scheming. It's the tale of your rise. A tale where you write history by fighting alongside humans and aliens, getting involved in both trivial and important matters, a tale that grows more grave as it progresses. And like any good BioWare games, you'll have to make hard choices that DO have consequences. There are conversations you can carry on with different characters(especially your crew) that can determine your relationship with them and leave a mark on them throughout the trilogy.       Regarding customization, you can change gender, facial traits(including scars), name, classes and background profile. The first and last two can change certain options in the story line. As you progress in the game, you'll gain either paragon, renegade or both kind of points, having more into one will make certain dialogue lines available to you and some gameplay bonuses. Also, the extreme of your morality will change the environment, soundtrack and a background picture at the end of the game.       Soundtrack is how it should be, giving the right vibes of what should any intro into a Sci-Fi should: the feeling you're stepping into mysterious grounds while wondering if the advancements you have will be enough. Certain key moments are enhanced by the soundtrack, decisions sound more dire, discoveries more interesting and the ending a hell lot more epic.       The gameplay is original as well; your weapons don't use ammo, but they can overheat. However, with the right weapons and the right weapon modding, shooting infinitely is almost reachable, but unnecessary, since most enemies die from the high level weapons. You can loot guns and equipment from corpses or crates, loot that can be used by you or your squadmaters, if the specifics are met.    There are unknown planets with different Eco systems and points of attractions for you to explore, with everyone's favorite vehicle, the Mako, which rides mountains just like horses in Skyrim(but with better logic) and bounces good enough to dance on ""Moves like Jagger"".        One more big fuss about this game is the romance options. You can end up into a relationship with a crew-mate. There are two options for each gender, the human of the opposite gender that is in the squad from the prologue or the hot blue alien which is a she no matter what.       For most good old games I feel the need to ask potential players to give it 3-6 hours or more for the game to get to them, but Mass Effect is engrossing since the beginning and it's new game plus material, not just for gameplay and achievements but for making different choices in the storyline you're going to remember for a long time.        Mass Effect is the starting point for a beloved trilogy, but also the kind of game that stands well on its own. It's not just nostalgia that makes some fans call it the best of the series. Even by today's standards, it's still unique and an example of how new Sci-Fi's should be made. The campaign can take between 15 to 60 hours, depending on how you play it, but even 15 is enough to satisfy(although you might find yourself spending more time than you'd decide). It runs with no problems with newer systems and the price is low regarding what is has to offer. In other words, it is a MUST BUY!      I'm a Mass Effect fan and this is my favorite game in the Galaxy! ",319,41,7,39,16,2,26

												This is my all-time favorite game! I hold the first game of the trilogy very dear. A great stroy, wonderful characters that develop throughout the games, romances everywhere and a galactical threat that makes you the paragon/renegade hero of the entire galaxy. I know all the criticism, I agree to most of it, but that doesn't make me stop playing this game over and over again and I have played it five times already, literally.Be the man/woman you always wanted to be, emerge into this fantastic universe and see what you can do to make it a better place for all species.

												Mass Effect has an atmosphere like no other in gaming. The experience of fighting for the universe in a world I would best describe as ""surreal"" is something every gamer needs to try.Good:+ Keith David+ Very good AI (Both enemy and friends)+ Graphics are pretty much perfect. And by perfect I mean the style fits everything else the game is trying to do exactly how it should+ Controls are exactly how you'd want them (Except for the Mako)+ Story has lots of depth and is plenty interesting+ Leveling up is amazingly satisfying+ Plenty of armor, weapon, and upgrade options+ Mako roaming splits up the on foot action very, very well+ Keith David+ Plenty of side quests+ Combat has tons of depth+ Recharging weapons make for unique combat+ You can be a total♥♥♥♥♥♥to everyone you don't like+ Keith David is amazing+ Music is amazing+ Did I mention Keith David!?Not so good:- It's quite linear (Which isn't a big issue at all, for me at least)- Some bugs here and there (You may end up having to reload a time or two)- You're glued to the ground (Probably more a personal issue)- The Mako could control more smoothlyMy complaints are minor while my compliments are off the charts.

												After replaying the entire trilogy a few times I am more convinced than ever that Mass Effect 1 is the best game of the series.Is it the most polished game of the series? No, that's ME2.Does it have the smoothest combat of the series? No, that's ME3.Does it have the best-written character/character arc of the series? No, that's Mordin Solus.But what it does have is the most cohesive design and story, an interesting universe, a great soundtrack and by far the least amount of fan pandering.It also runs quite well on PC. It does not have a wide array of in-game options or settings but if you are willing to edit some of the .ini files you will be able to really make the game shine.

												Mass Effect, released in 2007. Really? How could I live all those years without experiencing it? This game belongs to MUST PLAY section. The whole Mass Effect series!This game has it all. All the other games are about saving a girlfriend or a family, saving a city, a state, our planet, but the whole galaxy?? Mass Effect has definitely very interesting and exciting narrative, great character development and voice acting. It's a game where player choice affects the story of the entire Mass Effect Trilogy!If you want to see what I enjoyed the most here is  My Twitch Clips Compilation  full of love, drama, jealousy, violence on reporters, deadly yet hilarious fails, game glitches, nice music and happy endings!Please, if you want to get the full experience, start with this first Mass Effect! Highly recommended game and not only because it contains the best sex scenes I've ever seen in a video game..! ;)If you have any questions or comments feel free to post them!Mass Effect Andromeda is coming soooon yay!

A letter for the future generation of gamers and the newcomerIf you're reading this to check if the game is worthy, no matter how many years have passed since then, I wish you to know that I'm representing many Mass Effect fans out there and that my words are the actual representation of what we all feel, for I believe this game will stand the test of time.You're about to experience the ultimate word on story-telling sophistication of our time. The game itself had a lot of technical problems which includes too much ''loading screens'' of about everything you do or walk, wrong faced player camera after a cutscene and even some other design problems, but you may consideer all this unavoidable during the year 2008, Mass Effect was ahead of his times and all ambitious projects are prone to technical problems. What we advise you to do however, is to tolerate all the flaws at first because you will understand soon or later, if given the chance, why this game has spawned the best and biggest fans in gaming's history.Sometimes we just don't want to mumble about technical problems because we strongly believe it isn't just about that and it isn't really important. I refuse to highlight all of the cons and compromise what you're about to experience so I decided to keep things short and objective with the honesty about what matters, this is what we all experienced, some at first hand or a few later: Characters feels real, because they got too many lines and intricate personality. Soon you forget they're fictious and as they're part of your team your first instinct is - to care. This applies even for lesser NPCs you don't regularly interact with.The original soundtrack is the work of a master, every single piece of song fits perfectly on any ocassion in-game. All brought to you by Sam Hullick and Jack Wall which they got some inspiration from the 80s sci-fi movies, the best classical source for sci-fi. Such as Blade Runner.The plot was written firstly by Drew Karpyshyn, the real mastermind behind it and it was based on what really works; unexpected turn arounds. No one believes in you but your real friends and that creates a sense of heroism with commitment never done by any game before it. After he left the series, not much hope was left.As with the beginning of the series, ME1 as we call it is literally more RPG than Action. But the action is there and the tactics you can implement are a hybrid mouisture of dexterity with turn-battles when you pause time.When the music M4 Part II from the band Faunts plays with the staff roll, you know what you just experienced was a miracle. The proof human creativity, team work and artistic design has literally no limits and the result of that work remains on you.Every game needs personality and a soul. The sophistication I speak about was achieved through the narrative almost in the totallity of it and the majority of your experience will be triggered by human emotions - from the music, plot and the characters and the events e situation - for and to you directly. It's a Bioware signature since ever but better on Mass Effect.There are many positive things left we can't just express if we want to keep this letter on medium and wouldn't ever fit in here.In this letter I wish to write here for the record, so far great promises are coming from Mass Effect Andromeda which is almost releasing. If some of us aren't too happy, you can blame Electronic Arts. During Mass Effect 3 closure to our beloved series, they commited a series of mistakes such as rushing the game and its ending for the sake of their gains and also for pure incompetence. So far if it keeps rocking, we keep digging it... because we respect Bioware. Whatever had happened before and whatever awaits for us up ahead, It is here were it all began and will forever lives in our hearths. This is what it means to be a real N7, to flow with love and be aware of hate and all consequences that follows with both.Brazil born, Survivor, N7 Infiltrator. Balanced alligment, Tali's lover. Synthesis was the solution.Originally posted by Shepard to Andromeda Initiative:We have not other choice but to thrive.Sincerely, Mauro A. Souza - Signing off. ",66,3,1,4,1,0,3

Mass Effect begins the story of Commander Shepard. Please note that both Pinnacle Station and Bring Down the Sky DLC are free, but are not included with the Steam Version of Mass Effect.You can grab them from here: https://help.ea.com/en-us/help/dragon-age/dragon-age-origins/bioware-classics-dlcPROS- Textures are low quality, but there's a mod that fixes that called M.E.U.I.T.M- Cheats are incredibly easy to enable/use (to get the Super Armor and Super Gun)- Face off against a Krogan, the Geth, and even a Thresher Maw!- Choose the Paragon [Hero] or the Renegade [Badass] Path, you're choices ultimately shape the game (including what might and might not happen in ME2 or ME3)!CONS- Tali is not a romanceable character until ME2. You're stuck with either Ashley or Liara.- You'll be stuck in the Maco for 30+ minutes driving around large empty planets looking for mineral deposits, crash sites, anomolies and enemy bases.- Items in this game do not upgrade in the traditional sense. Let's say you have a level 1 rifle, if you pick up a level 2 rifle you'll be stuck with both unless you sell or convert it to omnigel.- Some of the planets/bases you go to will look identical but with different textures.Favorite line of the whole game: ""We don't have time for this idiot, Charge!""My Rating: 10/10 (Highly Recommended) ",89,5,0,7,3,0,5

												The first game of a truly amazing saga!For those who don't know ME yet: It's a Third-Person-Action-RPG.You're playing Commander Shepard, a man who will become the first human Spectre, an elite force of the galactical council, chasing the rogue spectre named Saren, uncovering the truth behind the disappearence of the protean race and facing an enemy which threatens all living beings in the galaxy.For me, this is one of the most brilliant and memorable game-series i played.The first game is a great start into all the emotions, decisions, the epic story, memorable characters and everything else the series has to offer.But let's not forget about the flaws (oh yeah, there are some)..- some beautiful, but empty and generic worlds to explore- the mako (the vehicle you'll drive on the planets)- there are literally only 3 or 4 interior templates used for sidequests, which make them all look alike (a shame, because the quests itself aren't bad or uninteresting)- the mako- the inventory (you'll end up clicking hundreds of times just to sell your stuff or make it into omnigel...no comfort function)- the freaking mako !seriously, whoever made the mako behave like he does, needs some serious punishment. :)I really like to explore the worlds, but the driving, jumping and general behaviour of the mako just drives me mad.Anyway...apart from these (imho minor) flaws, Mass Effect is a great start of the series and sets the foundation for an epic journey through the galaxy.Highly recommended!

General info~Genre: Action game with roleplaying elements~Number of players: 1~Downloadable content: available (not on Steam)~First part of a trilogy~Completion time: 20-45 hours~High replay valueStrong points+Rich story: Explore the Milky Way occupied by many alien species, each with its own detailed history and culture. Narration is fluid and players won't have any issues following the story as it expands and reach its climax.+Cast: A customizable protagonist (face, gender), ruthless villains and unforgettable companions (with different armour exclusive to their race). Expect to gain more enemies and allies as you clear the galaxy of terrorists and drug warlords.+High replay value: 6 classes that offer different play styles (sentinel, soldier, engineer, etc.), variable companion combinations, New game plus, etc. If you also add the two existing moral paths, the two protagonist genders and end game decisions you might easily spend more than 500 hours on this game.+Challenging: 5 difficulty levels to choose from; including easy, veteran and hardcore. Each difficulty level affects enemies' weapon damage as well as their skill selection and combat behaviour.+Hybrid theory: Mass Effect isn't just a space shooter. You will be constantly switching between action sequences and role playing diplomacy. Many of your previously completed quests will affect NPC's and companions' behaviour. Expect different comments depending on your previous decisions.+Battle tactics: With just a hit of a button you can pause the action and command your team to change positions or targets. You may also, depending on your class, choose different skills which may distract your adversaries (sabotage, lift, synthetic overload, etc.) or obliterate them. As you level up, more skill options become available and it will then rest on your tactical prowess to transform a hellish confrontation into a summer breeze.+From zero to hero: 60 levels to master (50 are accessible in your first playthrough), 6 companions to recruit (humans, asari, krogan, etc.), numerous skills to learn (you cannot maximize all of your skils in one playthrough, try various combinations and pick the ones you enjoy the most).+Devil or angel: Two moral paths to choose from; your overall attitude affects the NPCs' behaviour towards you as well as your appearance. Paragon attitude depicts a forgiving, humane Shepard while the Renegade path is suited for all of you psychos and vigilantes! I've tried them both and they are both rewarding and fun to play as.+Pass the legacy: After finishing the game you can a)export your saved game to Mass effect 2 and keep your key-choices and/or b)start a New game plus with your skills/characteristics intact)+Soundtrack: for a great tale to be told, a music score of equivalent value is needed. Check the whole OST uploaded by TantrisOST in youtube:


YouTube™ Video: Mass Effect -  Main Theme 

			Views: 1,185,088		

			Main Theme to the excellent videogame Mass Effect. Composed by Sam Hulick and Jack Wall.		

+View: with your own spaceship land on imaginary planets, each with its own atmosphere, flora and fauna. You can also visit our Sol system for some funny comments from the crew and codex entry system. Also, on Luna...+Price: significantly low during sales.Weaknesses-Full pockets: In many instances, your inventory will overflow with useless weapons, redundant armour portions and obsolete ammo mods. Do not forget to visit periodically your inventory in order to clean it up or you might end up wasting half an hour during the last chapter making room for some new weapons and armour.-Choices ungiven: despite being abundant, only a few choices actually matter for the game's finale. A few other choices might end up affecting characters shown on the two sequels, but their significance is negligible for everyone who plans to play the first Mass Effect only.-The missing chapter: Unless played as part of a trilogy, Mass effect 1 seems like an unresolved tale. Also, I must add that the third game is not available on Steam and everyone interested must create an account at EA's Origin in order to buy and play the game there.-Not so challenging after all: Mass effect targets a wide audience.  Experienced players may find its simplicity frustrating and its regeneration system debatable. As an old school gamer myself, I never paid too much attention to those mechanics since Mass Effect  finds a few plot tricks to justify them. Play for yourselves and form an opinion based on your own experience.Neutral ground±KotOR clone: Players will identify strong resemblances to Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, mainly found at the morale system and plot structure. Bioware never hide the fact that they wanted to create their own space game and their involvement with KotOR affected Mass Effect  alot.My rating4/5Mass Effect has its flaws, mainly found in the battle system and narration pattern. Nevertheless, if you are tired of medieval cliché with dwarves and elves, try conquering the galaxy nebula by nebula while communicating with alien races or facing your galactic adversaries armed with futuristic weaponry.

												Imagine a movie with an intriguing story that has all of the twists and excitement of a summer blockbuster but then imagine that you can make the main character into whoever you want.  You can be the biggest bad♥♥♥♥♥in the galaxy or the most respected stand up hero history has known.An rpg that really allows for exciting space battles and exploration that has never before been seen on this scale and production quality.Do yourself a favor, even if you didn't like the later games in the series, play this one.  Know what a true space rpg is meant to be.			",239,70,6,24,47,6,33

												While I've only played through this entry once, I feel I can say this is definitive sci-fi entertainment. Gameplay:The gameplay is a bit clunky and awkward, but I also went back to play this after playing Mass Effect 2 (I wanted to play it again with a save import from the first). It may not seem as bad from the perspective of a new player, but various aspects just feel rough around the edges. From the UI right down to the controls, it feels very, very unrefined. The UI, especially the inventory screen, was a bit confusing the first few hours, and it never really became second nature throughout the rest of the game, as tends to happen with other RPGs. There are also some performances issues and quite a few bugs (it wasn't until after my playthrough that I realized the game didn't look awful at max settings, it was just bugged and forced everything to the lowest settings).While the gunplay and UI are a bit difficult to get a feel for at first, what this game manages to nail down perfectly is interaction with characters. You choose conversation choices from a dialog-wheel. While simple in it's execution, this small, six-segment wheel is your gateway to learning about the universe and the characters of the game, as well as the system that allows you to leave your mark on the galaxy.StorySomething about the setting and character's of this game really pulled me in. Perhaps it's just how fleshed out it all is. Every planet, even insignificant ones, has at least a brief write-up. Conversing with crew members reveals detailed pasts and unique personalities that leave you wishing there were more options on the dialog wheel. The varied alien races have entire histories, both as solitary civilizations, and as members of the galctic community. The universe feels vast, one of few games that manages to make you feel like there is more to the world outside of what you've seen.If you are someone who loves to get drawn into detailed univserses, or are a fan of detailed characters that you actually start to genuinely like - or hate - Mass Effect is the game, and series, for you.

Reviews for the Deaf and Hard of HearingOverall Rating: 9/10Gameplay Rating: 9/10Accessibility Rating: 7/10NotesOverall rating is a combination of the gameplay (mechanics and story) and accessibility (how the game includes deaf/hoh gamers).  If you disagree with my take on the game or if something is factually incorrect, please leave a comment below!General GameplayThe first in a series from BioWare, Mass Effect was designed to be an open, choose-your-own-adventure type game within a relatively loose storyline.You play as a Human Alliance Navy Commander named Shepard.  You're quickly embroiled in a fight to save not only yourself and crew, but humanity and all races in the universe from extinction at the hands of the Reapers.The story for Mass Effect and the effects between games that your decisions have makes playing the whole series on occasion quite enjoyable.  The games can be long, so they can be daunting to try and replay.  Make sure you have time!General AccessibilityAccessibility OptionsMass Effect opens to the main menu, so you can set subtitles before the game begins.  Sound controls let you adjust music, sound effects, and dialogue volumes independently.  For gamers with mobility issues, you can rebind all keys to suit your needs.In gameplay, there are few indicators that you are being shot at or that you were hit.  The bullet animations are fast, and you may miss them until your shield is gone already.  I often did not know I was being shot until my health was critically low, which is the first major visual indicator of damage.  This can make the game frustrating at times.Subtitles & CaptionsPros:- Subtitles are large and easy to read with light blue text and black border.- In conversations, you see who is talking and subtitles at the same time.Cons:- Most subtitles are shown because you trigger them, but some come from nearby people and they are not named, so you may not know who is talking.Chatting/CommunicatingMass Effect is single player; no chatting available or required.---Visit Games Reviews for the Deaf/HoHhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/gamereviewsforthedeaf ",140,22,1,25,38,1,30

Teal DeerDevelopers: BioWarePublishers: Electronic ArtsInitial release: May 2008Genre: Action, RPG, Story Heavy#Worth/NotWorth: #SoWorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationMass Effect is the first in an epic trilogy. This is about 9 years too late but maybe there are still people that don't know what this is.An original world from our beloved BioWare that evokes a very real lived in feeling of a modern sci fi space opera. Mass Effect is more RPG than shooter despite it usage of firearms. Class specialization is quite important going anywhere from a soldier, vanguard/adept at biotics (a sort of sci fi magic, manipulation of dark matter) and tech specialist. Weapons training is also very important as the guns are not exactly accurate and if your character is not trained with that weapon it will be almost entirely useless as they are not accurate at all.  You play as either John or Jane Shepard, Commander in the N7 Alliance Navy. Despite what most people think of this character I believe this character to be a nobody. As in, a representative to put yourself inside of.. someone who represents anyone who actually gives a damn. As I believe that the character of Shepard is relatively inconsequential, an almost idealistic version of a real person. To make a timely reference.. a MockingJay. This is a highly narratively driven game, at every conversation you are given the ability to choose your dialogue choices. Unfortunately, broken down it generally resorts into three types of responses. Paragon- the sort of goody two shoes, Renegade- The sort of I don't have time for this person and the exploratory reaches of exposition. My only complaint here is that certain actions grant you either paragon or  renegade points which will unlock further dialogue options in other situations but in order to use them you need to have the pre-requisite amount making playing a sort of gray character almost impossible. The gameplay loop goes something like this. You receive a mission statement from someone main quest or not and you fly there on the galaxy map, explore a bit, land in the mako (a sort of all terrain vehicle with highly questionable physics, though I've never been to another planet so who am I to say) find a base, shoot all the things, have some dialogue, make your paragon or renegade choice, go back to the ship, get mission, fly there on the galaxy map.. you get the picture. I don't mean to sound dismissive but if you try for a lot of the side missions it can indeed get rather tedious. Though some of them are quite expositional. In between missions you are encouraged to speak with your crew; ask them how they are doing and what they thought of the last mission, they might even divulge what they think about the bigger picture. There is room for.. romance. Should the desire strike your fancy though options are limited especially compared to the games there after this one. I should mention at this point that at the time of writing this, this is my third time completing Mass Effect 1. Additionally I have completed Mass Effect 2 five times and Mass Effect 3 three times. I did not intend on having my opinion of those games influence this review however I feel as a human that is likely going to be impossible or if at all even just unintentional. THE GIST Mass Effect is a world that for me personally rivals and triumphs over other Sci Fi worlds such as Star Wars and Star Trek, perhaps that is because of when I was introduced to it or perhaps because it truly is just more interesting. This is the beginning of an epic saga that is easily in the top 3 series of games I have ever played. I'm sure most people either know what this game is already or has played it as many times as I but I wanted to actually write something and sort of.. have my official stamp on it so to speak. The cycle cannot be stopped.Follow my curation for more ",1042,295,48,106,94,7,96

												----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is my 3rd favourite game in the trilogy. I've played it only 5 times, but would love, and will replay it again. The best part of this game is, that your choices inpact the 2nd one, some in a small way, some in a big way, all of the matter!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The graphics are from 2007, and are outdated as in 2016-2017, but are more than playable.The gameplay is a bit clunky, but is still alright, you can chose from 6 different classes, which aren't indept as in the other games, but are unique form eachother.The sound is good. Differently not as good as in the 2nd and 3rd game, but is still good.The length of the game is about 25-30 hours on easier, and about 35-40 hours on higher difficulty, it get's even longer, if you do the side-quests, in which they are alot of them!Your choices are matter, they aren't indept as the other games, but are really good here aswell.The AI is alright, a little outdated, but is still good.The voice acting is on par with the other 2, and is amazing!Here you firstly are introduced to the iconic characters, who will stay with you untill the end of 3! They are great!The story is amazingly done, it might get a little boring in the end beggining, and the start of the middle, but after that it's great! The character customization is not that good, but the default characters are the best.Overall, I give this game a 8.8/10 [This is my opinion, and I hope you'll respect it.]If you've read all of the way to here, I thank you for reading it all, it means alot! :DI am not an English speaker, and sorry if I misspelled something, or a sentence didn't make sence.Thanks again for reading it all, and I hope you'll have a great day.But for now...

												Mass Effect 1: The game that started it all.If you read or watch Youtube videos regularly about ""Top 10 Best Gaming Moments in Recent Memory"" or ""Top 10 Best Video Games of Last Generation"" or something along those lines, you've probably seen Mass Effect get pointed out in one of those top 10s very often. After having enough of seeing Mass Effect mentioned on one of the lists, I decided to get Mass Effect and see it for myself. After completing a playthrough as a full out paragon war hero soldier and even imported my character to Mass Effect 2 (Where you can find my review here) and I think Mass Effect was simply outstanding. It had the best overall plot of the three games and had several unforgettable moments, there are quite a few flaws.GraphicsFor the visuals, they took some time to get used to because in some ways it looks like you're watching a TV show in the 80's-90's. However, in time, I was able to get used to the visuals and was highly impressed. For a game from 2007, the visuals are very good. Obviously, they don't compare to Mass Effect 2 and 3's visuals, but I'd prefer not to compare this to the other games. GameplayThe gameplay is probably the weak point of the game. I understand that this game is partially a tactical shooter, but let's be real here: You don't need to use the abilities for each character, the enemies are either easy to kill or too difficult to kill, and the AI is awful. I didn't like the firing at first how it decreases your accuracy, but I got used to it after the first few missions. The gameplay definitely did not age well in the past few years, that's for sure.StoryThe story is the strongest point in the game. Saren plays the role as the main villain very well. I wouldn't say he's top ten worthy, but he's still an amazing character. Too bad it started to get cheesy towards the end. As some people have said, Mass Effect does not actually take off until Virmire, where several of the biggest moments in the trilogy are encountered. The other characters are pretty cool, like the Krogan bounty hunter Wrex (Who is 100x cooler than Grunt in Mass Effect 2) and Liara, an Asari biotic who studies the Protheans, an ancient race who was destroyed by a certain group of people.[masseffect.wikia.com] Overall plot was the best in the series and was just awesome. I don't want to spoil it, so just buy the game!AudioThe voice actors did VERY well when playing their roles. I think the best of the voice actors were either Ali Hillis (Liara) or Brandon Keener (Garrus) but Wrex, Shepard, and Saren's roles stood out, too. The music is awesome and I enjoy hearing it, the only problem I have with the audio is that half of the time all you hear is ""pew pew pew"" coming from the guns or ""Shields down!"" The music should've played some more so I can here my gun going ""pew pew pew"" while I hear epic music playing in the background. When the music didn't play, the mission felt very bland. ReplayabilityThe replayability in this game is just about as strong as the other Mass Effects, but from what I've seen from others, this Mass Effects seems like it is the one that is replayed the most. The story wraps you in to the point you've realized you played the game seven times. VerdictIn the end, Mass Effect is a strong start to an amazing sci fi RPG trilogy. I highly recommend it. I assure you, you will not regret it.Graphics- 8/10Gameplay- 4.5/10Story- 10/10Audio- 9.5/10Replayability-  9/10.:8.2/10:.+Best overall plot+Great villain+Amazing visuals+High replayability+Solid RPG elements-Awful AI-Tedious combat-Music barely plays-Gets really cheesy toward the end			",150,23,0,20,8,2,12

												TL;DR: Great game - engrossing storyline, decent combat system, fun exploration, slightly branching storyline. Classic. Buy it.How did it take me so long to find you, Mass Effect? Where have you been my whole life?As you can tell from the above text (and the blue thumbs-up symbol) I rather enjoyed Mass Effect. From the get-go till the end, the in-game fiction is well woven, making this one of the best developed sci-fi universes I've had the pleasure of being involved with. The intricacy of the universe certainly puts series like Star Wars (the movies, at least) to shame. There are lots of distinct alien races with believable cultures and histories (though for the most part they are all humanoid and speak English...). The future technology is well explained with the usual pseudo-science.The story was pretty good. As Shepherd, a man/woman in the Alliance (human) military, you start off investigating a distress call from a remote colony. Things go bad pretty quick, and you discover secrets which threaten the security of the galaxy. The next bit of the game concerns you gaining the trust of the Council (galactic government) in order to become a super-special-ops sort of dude. Then it's time to recruit a team of the best aliens and humans out there and set about saving the galaxy from it's ultimate doom!Gameplay is as a 3rd person, squad-based shooter. The controls are easy to pick up, and allow you to bring up a squad menu which pauses the game and allows you to tell you squad members to use their biotic powers (think the Force from Star Wars but better) or tech abilities, or switch weapons and so on.As a sort of space-RPG, you choose your class in the beginning, which defines what weapons and abilities you can use. You also level up during the progress of the game, allowing you to hone those skills. You can also set it so you can control the levelling-up of your squad members' skills as well. You do tend to pick up a lot of loot, allowing you to get new weapons and armour, upgrade existing ones and so on, depending on your class. Unfortunately, you have only a limited amount of inventory space, and it fills up pretty quick. I kept finding myself having to empty my inventory in the middle of levels.A great feature of this game is exploration, as you get put in command of the experimental Alliance frigate, the Normandy. You can fly her wherever you wish, and land on many planets with the Mako jeep/tank thing. Lots of people hate the Mako for its wayward handling, but I loved it! The only downside is a lot of the optional planets are pretty repetetive/boring.One thing which I liked in this game (compared to the second) is that it is not divided into ""hub areas"" and ""combat areas"". You could be attacked anywhere, even on the Citadel (the galactic capital). You never know whether a mission will be a simple mission where you just have to talk someone down, or whether you will have to fight your way through rooms full of enemies.This brings us to another thing. Choice. People often get sniffy when video games claim to offer choice to the users, saying they follow the same storyline anyway, whatever choice you make. Well, this is mostly true. However, there are several choices you can make in the game which are imported to the second, which can make the game much harder, or very much alter the tone. I enjoyed having the choices personally, as it made me able to at least feel like I was doing things 'my way'.I should go.			",41,2,2,2,2,0,6

9.5/10+  This is one of the best single player experiences I have ever had; it is a must play for any RPG or sci-fi fan. It is probably one of the most expansive and interesting sci-fi universes created in the last decade. The story and characters had me fully engaged from beginning to end, and that isn't an easy feat to accomplish for the vast majority of video games. While the second and third games were continual refinements of gameplay, their stories were not nearly as original and refreshing as the first entry.-  The gunplay could be sloppy, the graphics look a little muddy these days, the cookie cutter planets could be repetitive, the elevators were too slow; this game wasn't without flaws. However, this will be one of the only (if not THE only) times where I can say I overlooked every gameplay flaw because the story hooked me so hard.			",73,3,1,9,7,0,8

												What happens when you take a RPG, give it a sci-fi setting, make it choice-based, throw in some political themes, add in extremely likable characters, make it a third-person shooter, give it fun gameplay, and then craft an epic narrative out of it? You get Mass Effect. Mass Effect is the Star Wars inspired masterpiece created by Canadian developer Bioware. It was the result of the dev's desire to have full creative liberties over a sci-fi game. They essentially took the engine, mechanics, and structure of KOTOR and made an original game. If you are a fan of sci-fi, you will love this game. If you're a fan of videogames, you will love this game.Pros:Everything said in the introCons:Rendering error in Noveria and IlosResults:  9/10Sci-fi masterpiece			",45,4,0,7,3,0,2

												I played as a Paragon female Shepard for my first playthrough, and that is what I'm using as a basis for this review. My computer is in no way high-end; I played on medium graphics settings and had to mess with the console sometimes to force the characters to render, so I will not be commenting on graphics.THE GOOD--Oh man, the worldbuilding. Multiple worlds built, I should say. I've been yearning for a space opera to poke around in for ages, and am so glad I found this game. Could it have been better? Sure. More populated, more cities with actual cultures to discover, a bit more variety, all would've been welcome. But is it still good/fun/exciting to explore the way it is? Yes, yes it is.The battle system is fun. Granted I played on casual setting because I enjoy being feelthy, but it was seriously a great time to run in and smack the bad guys around with the stock of my shotgun after shooting their HP down to the nubs from behind a turned over rubbish bin.The actual plot is not at all new or unusual for a hard sci-fi, ""alienz and advanced technologiez are great!!!1!"" type of story. It's still engrossing despite the lack of originality and the Big Reveal of the ~overarching theme~ is awesome.THE BAD--This game has really awesome male characters and annoying AF females. Tali is pretty cool, but Ashley cites siccing a dog on a bear ""no matter how much you love the dog"" along with her xenophobia and Liara is a caricature of just. Of just everything. Kaidan is fairly milquetoast as well because when playing as Fem!Shep everything is centred around him trying to get in your pants.You're better off just taking take Garrus and Wrex everywhere, swap out one to Tali as needed. Yes, really. The aliens are great, take them all the time.THE UGLY--THIS IS NOT HOW PEOPLE SPEAK, WHY WOULD YOU STRUCTURE SENTENCES LIKE THAT, WRITERS?? I feel like BioWare needs to have a writer either already trained or sent out specifically to learn some screenplay/theater writing skills because I spent so much time wincing when people began to converse. I actually facepalmed during the romance dialogue with Kaidan. I had to turn off the game for a bit during a Major Confrontation with a Very Important Character because the conclusion was in no way built upon the previous lines of dialogue and that was just so rage inducing.The overarching plot is great, epic even. But it seriously falls down on the job when people open their mouths.TL;DR--Excellent game despite how cringe-worthy the writing is. Play if you want to steep in a Space Opera for a while, but if Compelling Storytelling Via The Interplay Between Characters is your jam, be prepared to groan a lot.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So good that I sat through the black screen credits!!!Everything in this game is put together and presented so well. The tactical 3rd-person combat with a slew of skills to cast made for some damn good fun. Compelling voice-work combined with a great soundtrack and storyline make the non-combat parts of this game very entertaining to sit through. BioWare's signature dialog options are available too, but don't always turn out to be what you expect. I don't know why they don't make the dialog options more clear. Many times Shepard (the protagonist) says something completely extreme to what the dialog option appears to be. Anyway...thats just a minor gripe. Its still fun to be caught off guard by the results of some of the dialog options.Character skill trees allow you to build your team to fit your playstyle. You can choose to invest in mage-like biotic skills, or beef out your weapon proficiency, or dabble in bits of both.I did find myself spending a lot of time in exploration and side-missions. The worlds are littered with bits of information that help in telling the full backstory. Side missions tend to have decent independent stories as well. My only gripe with them is that the maps for the side missions got somewhat repetitive after while. It wasn't too big of a concern since the worlds usually look pretty different form each other.  It took me a while to finally get around to playing this game. As a bonus, it looks pretty great when played with the M.E.U.I.T.M HD mod. I spent about 37 hours in Mass Effect. I definitely recomment playing it.			",632,132,18,87,35,3,106

												No game is perfect, but Mass Effect is extremely close. The universe, the story, the characters, the voice actors (especially Jennifer Hale as the female Shepard), the gameplay, that combines third-person shooter elements with RPG stuff, and the amount of things you can do in this game is simply mindblowing. The only thing it lacks in my opinion is the freedom of Deus Ex. But even so, you still have a lot of freedom to shape the experience to your own preferences. No doubt one of the best games ever made. And the graphics are actually quite impressive considering the release year.			",11,1,2,1,0,0,0

Posted: February 6
In the year 2148, explorers on Mars discovered the remains of an ancient spacefaring civilization. In the decades that followed, these mysterious artifacts revealed startling new technologies, enabling travel to the furthest stars. The basis for this incredible technology was a force that controlled the very fabric of space and time. They called it the greatest discovery in human history. The civilizations of the galaxy call it... Mass Effect.Codex entries, Mars Rovering and squad-based shootouts: the Mass Effect experience.Relatively massive aRPGs are always a highly subjective experience. There's so many ways to play them that it can be argued that no two people are playing the exact same game. So it's only fair that I just detail how I played Mass Effect, so you can choose, no circle menu needed, how relevant this review is to you.Vanguard class, on Veteran difficulty, completed all the missions (even the garbage collection ones) and explored every planet before taking on the story missions, read all the codex entries, concentrated on using all powers and abilities, and constantly switched out companions.This means that absolutely everything in the following review is so highly subjective that you can append everything with ""playing the way I played it."" So that's exactly what we're going to do, every time something subjective comes up I'm going to mark it with an asterisk (*).""Help me out here, Shepard. The lines between friend and foe are getting a little blurry from where I stand.""- Urdnott Wrex Playing the way I played is dangerous. A Renegade choice, even, chewing through all the optional stuff first. It was obviously not intended to be played in that way and I don't recommend it *.If anything, you really want to pace yourself. As it is, playing my way, you get a flat 60% of the game's worst content upfront, the 60% of garbage filler planet exploration * and exposition, followed by 25% of decent filler content (Hackett's errands, Citadel quests, and a half dozen missions that end in hilariously anticlimactic text prompts), and finally the 15% of excellent story content. So do one story mission, then a third of the planet exploration, and so on. All this takes you through two main forms of gameplay and some fairly hefty conversations.The core firefight gameplay is pretty consistenly good *. You have a lot of tools at your disposal and get incredibly overpowered by the end with double-stacked mods and the best gear that credits can buy *. With Barrier-spamming and a shotgun in hand you're encouraged to run into firefights instead of just toeing it behind cover, which leads to satisfyingly aggressive fights, and your other abilities range from debuffs, to disablers, to squad-wide revival *.All this is supported by some great sound design - meaty gun blasts and hard-hitting shield displacement - and gives you some unique eye-candy to look at while doing it, outside of a few notably awkward armour designs and some very drab interiors in the planet exploration stages *.""We are trained for espionage. We would be legends, but the records are sealed. Glory in battle is not our way. Think of our heroes: the Silent Step, who defeated a nation with a single shot, or the Ever Alert, who kept armies at bay with hidden facts.""- Captain KirraheWhen the music is great, it's great. When it's not, you're listening to the same three lazy space ambient tracks while mountain-climbing your way through the game's endless supply of Steam Greenlight-tier empty barren maps with the Mako *, the game's Mars-Rover-Tank thing.Now the Mako itself controls fine. Even great, I'd say. Pulling off some manoeuvres like jumping over a trio of rockets and returning with one back that just reduces a squad to shreds, before landing with a satisfying clunk, never got old *.But the maps are absolutely awful, outside of the story maps. The Mako works best when you're forced to continually get in and out of it, not just driving to the same two dungeons filled with different assets, struggling with the physics engine to get over mountains and getting bored to sleep treading through endless plains.So that's the bulk of the gameplay *.There's some ""under the hood"" RPG systems ala Deus Ex, which mostly amount to ""equip the thing that makes your points go higher"", but switching armour and weapons does lend some visual variety to the game and there are some endgame ammo types and power-speccing that allow for different playstyles - even within classes *.Now this is a game that is designed for gamepads first and foremost. Use a gamepad if you can. The menus are designed for crab people. The auto-aim and stat-based aiming is so ridiculous it's not like that's a concern. It's completely playable with a keyboard and mouse if you can think like a crab-person for said menus, it's just awkward and the RPG aiming means you can be staring right at an enemy and still miss.A word of warning: Steam's version of Mass Effect is fairly buggy. If anything you're probably better off buying the Origin version, since you get the DLC and a fair few bug fixes, but if you have an inherent aversion to Origin you can still enjoy audio/BGM constantly cutting out and characters having a tenuous connection to the material plane.No asterisk there, note that.""We impose order on the chaos of organic evolution. You exist because we allow it, and you will end because we demand it.""- SovereignThe widely lauded story is fairly good, if very Bioware tropey, but the majority of the dialogue and flavour text is based around exposition around various worldbuilding elements. Even at the most dramatic moments, Mass Effect has no problem dropping its in-universe jargon to enforce how consistent it's world is. This isn't a bad thing, but people who like reading codex entries and discovering how a new world works are probably going to get more out of the story out of people looking for a standard RPG or action plot *.Characters have their own driving motivations and backstories, and even the most alien races are driven by fear, anger or plain boredom, and unless you're completely averse to conversations, at no point does it feel like a slog getting through them.Shame that they're underwritten *. As a rule of thumb, you'll get about three conversations out of a squad member, and one conversation out of a regular NPC. Most of them trigger just after a few travel screens, but a few trigger after story missions - this means that for half the game, half your squad will just repeat itself, and vice-versa for the other half*.For some inane reason, most of the inter-squad conversations are reserved for the elevator transitions, elevators that you will absolutely want to skip at every possible moment *. Ignore that asterisk, everyone should skip the elevators. They're awful. Use the rapid transit system when you can.""Goodbye, Shepard. Thank you.""- SarenMass Effect is a good game that's held back by filler content that doesn't use the core gameplay as much as it should. That and really bad, bland maps for most of that filler *.Is it worth playing? Absolutely. Mass Effect is a one-of-a-kind space opera RPG. Nothing else quite like it out there.And you don't need an asterisk on that.			",167,32,1,20,5,0,2

												Straight to the point:1) You spend 1/3 of the game riding the elevators. Square-shaped, round-shaped, vertical, with some angle, fast, slow, EVERY KIND OF! I wanna thank the developers for so impressive variety! It didn't even annoy me when I'd finished reading the 2nd Shakespeare's book during elevators rides. Really impressive and not boring part of the game!2) Even your vehicle can jump, but not the main hero. Sometimes you can accidently mistake by leaving your vehicle on a rocky surface and not being able to return to it because you can't jump. But it's not the time to get upset! Bioware envisaged the situations when you can't get back to your vehicle which is 5 meters from you. All you have to do is return to your spaceship on the orbit and then go back. Hard to think of a greater idea. Bioware definitely nailed it!3) The exploring of the planets makes you to feel physical pain. Don't be surprised with finding your fist at the other side of your monitor when you'll explore the exact same building or underground complex like you did 20 times before. Actually they vary, you just have to notice it. Look at the crates inside the rooms. They have the different order! That's enough, right, Bioware? Oh and the People's Choice Award goes straight to that sattelite model. It's used for everything! You can find it on every planet. Sattelites, beacons, nukes and ♥♥♥♥ing tons of other purposes! I won't be surprise if this sattelite is able to cure the cancer or it killed John Kennedy.But seriously though, this game worth playing. kthxbye ",60,10,2,12,4,0,6

												If you ever wanted to explore the galaxy, or if you like sci-fi, or you are a sucker for space operas, you can pick this game up right away. You are Commander Shepard, and your Shepard can be a grizzled veteran marine, a tech savvy scoundrel, or a biotic powerhouse. He/she can also be something in between any of these classes. This game is all about the choices you make, and those choices will affect your environment, other characters relationships with you, how cheap or expensive new weapons will be at stores etc.The exploration mechanic of the game is based on star clusters and star systems. As you travel the galaxy and solve missions, new clusters of stars will appear on the map, giving you more chances to explore. Indeed, the crux of the game is exploration and the game does this part very well. As you explore, you will also gain bits and pieces of information which form the lore of the Mass Effect universe.And now about this game's shortcomings. Fortunately, there aren't many, and they are nothing immediately off-puting. The combat and gunplay feel a bit sluggish at times, and the exploration can get tedious at times. Planetary maps are not that large, but they feel empty expect for a camp here and there, or an anomaly.All things considered, I highly recommend this game to anyone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mass Effect changed how I look on games as media, before I liked games but I was almost never really invested in the stories they told, that all changed when I played this game. Mass Effect is a classic game that everyone should at least play once in their lifetime, the story is so well told and written it will keep you invested the whole way, the characters you meet and get to know are some of the best characters I have ever seen in a game. But this game is not only awesome because of the good story and well written characters but also because the world they made for this game is simply one of the best universes in not only games but in all of fiction. Both the aliens and the humans in this game feel real and convincing.I’m a big sci fi nerd and I have always been fascinated by how they portray the human race, in most sci fi that is a huge hit or miss, example of this is how humans are in star trek (love star trek) they are simply too nice they don’t feel like the more grey humanity we know. In mass effect they made a human race that seems like a logical step from how we think and act today, no perfect goodwillers ( like star trek), not some evil war empire( like in 40k) but somewhere in between(maybe a bit more to the 40k on the scale then star trek, kind of on the same place as babylon 5 grey humans not black or white). The universe they made feels alive and almost real something most fiction fail at.The gameplay is maybe weak in some areas like the mako but it doesn't really matter because what you get out of this game is simply more than just gameplay (gameplay is good in most parts) you get a good story. Should you buy this game? I think so because I think if you don’t you will miss out on one of the best modern games ever made, you will also miss the start of a saga that only got better in mass effect 2. This Game changed my whole view on games and it has stuck with me after all this years and I think that is a testament to how much of an impact this game had on me.Story 10/10Music 9/10Atmosphere 10/10Gameplay 8/10Replayability 9/10Final Score a solid 9/10 because no game or media is perfect.PS: sorry for any bad English I have always been bad at typing and spelling even in my own language, also if you wonder why my playtime is so low its because i played the games on the xbox back in the day, think I finished mass effect 1 7 or 8 times. Was planning to play through all the games on pc but i haven’t gotten around to doing it yet. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Short preview: (+) Enough good story. ✅  (+) Long game-time length. ✅ It was 61 hours for me, with side-quests, “assignments”,.  (+) Customizable dialogue. ✅ Click here to see it!   (-) It doesn’t run on Windows 7 – 64 bit, even with changed compatible mods. ✗ It’s fixable with an official patch, click here![masseffect.bioware.com] (-) Sometimes the body and face animations lags at the end of sentence. ✗  (-) There’s not enough action, shooting. ✗  Crashes / Bugs / Glitches:After I had updated it to v.1.2, and was able to run, I had a weird glitch, which was that the keyboard rarely refused to work in the game. I had to use ALT+TAB+Delete and restart the game. Without keyboard, I couldn’t save it before the had the process stopped. :(  My personal opinion:Unfortunately, this game has many minor flaws. Rarely / sometimes the voice acting didn’t match to the correct character behaviour. For example; I was in a calm conversation and the other character was in trouble, and I would have liked to offer my help ‘Can I help you?’, but Shepard said, ’What do you want?’, in a rather rude way. :(  The 40% of the game-play was a talking simulator (with all side quests) for me. I found myself in a good action at the beginning, and when we docked in the Citadel, I had talked and walked place to place for 9 hours, in that same giant spaceship the Citadel! Fortunately, they were not too long, but a lot of! When I began to bore it, fortunately, I managed to start the second main mission and left the Citadel.  The side quests rather repetitive, go to planet to planet, kill them, bring that, talk with them.  BUT! ALL AFTER THESE! The story blew up and gave me a desperate interesting! The last 30% of the game was absolutely cool and interesting for me! And I knew then, that the sort of boring 70% of game-play was needed. To get to know the other civilisations, species, their life and habits. They all needed for the complete feeling! At the end of the game, I was rally happy that I’ve bough this game and finished it. ✅  Recommendation:Despite the many minor flaws, I was happy to get to know this story/game. I can recommend it to them who;  Like Sci-fi stories.  Like to talk with non human species.  Like to behave as you are. (Or at least similar what you are.)  Like to discover other planets. (Sort of open world)  Future atmosphere.  Like or bear to do repetitive side-quests.  Achievement hunting:There’s no Steam achievements, but there’s in-game achievements. So, your Average-Steam-Achievement-Rate won’t increase or decrease with this game. It was a good news for me. ✅			",96,2,0,7,3,0,3

												Personal Rating: Very satisfied, some minor gameplay annoyancesClassic Rating: ★★★★☆ME is a pretty solid game with an excellent plot and characters, good soundtrack, entertaining gameplay.Some things could be done better, though:✘ Camera can be annoying while fighting and running, it behaves erratically.✘ Getting to cover is somehow ""bugged"": sometimes you want to cover and Shepard doesn't care, sometimes you're just passing near a wall and Shepard gets to cover on his own. Moreover, you can't lean while in cover behind some walls and therefore you can't fire.✘ Mako: weird controls - slightly press a direction arrow, Mako turns by 30 degrees; problem is, there's plenty of quests using it.I encountered 1 bug on the Citadel and on Zhu's Hope Colony: after completing a couple of quest, I could not move anymore, I did lose both mouse and keyboard inputs ingame - had to close game's window and reload. It fixed itself by saving before reading the quest log in my Diary.""Impressed"": I played ME and ME2 so far, hope to get my hands on ME3 soon.			",615,225,27,59,46,11,72

												this game...it blows my mind. i nearly 100%'d the trilogy within a two week time period, spending an average of 40-50 hours per game. i skipped some side missions because i was OBSESSED with the story, so one could easily get more game time than that out of them. i did go back and 100% this one and clocked in around 60-ish. this one is my favorite :) (but ME3 is a better game). ME is a lot like other bioware RPGs, notably KOTOR and dragon age. anyway, it gives this surreal illusion of the vastness of space but you never even leave the galaxy, you ride in YOUR SPACESHIP to other star clusters via mass relays, which basically zoop you off at FTL speeds. cool thing: your character/decisions you make in this game carry over to the second one (and then both to the third). so there's some replay value in story changes due to who you keep in your squad, who you kill/let live, results/decisions from missions, etc. 10/10, will play again (and again).

												Mass Effect games are always fun to talk about, never sure if I love or hate them more.The 1st game in the series undoubtedly plays most like an RPG of the 3 games, though even then, it would stand as a rather odd RPG when compared to others. For those that have played BioWare's best work: Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic, you'll notice some similar sub-stories, characters, and styles. I mention this only because the influence is strongest in the 1st game, when the series hasn't really defined itself completely.Anyways, it stands as the black sheep of the trilogy for its odd mix of RPG and 3rd person shooter mechanics. It does, however, possess strengths the others lack. The Lovecraftian horror influence is pretty clear in some of the side quests that take you to remote planets -- the fear of the unknown, the ominous music all play into this. The vehicular sections on the remote planets are a bit clunky, but they do a good job of establishing mystery -- you don't know quite what you're going to find. This works well in both reinforcing the trilogy's whole narrative and the general style the narrative embodies: the unknown, powerful threat, the dirty/dark sci-fi.Of course, one has to forgive the incessantly repeated interiors and textures for the side quests, this game lacks polish. If one can get past it, one will find a series of stories that help add to and fill in Mass Effect's universe, even setting things up for the sequels well.If one does everything, the game will take roughly 45-50 hours. If one moves through the narrative alone, you can complete it in 10-15 hours. The main story narrative has the strongest KOTOR infuence. KOTOR was a campaign across a series of planets, not an entire galaxy. Mass Effect too, is composed of fairly long missions on a small handful of planets -- each a sort of individual story that connects to the larger narrative. Or there's the fact that in both KOTOR and ME1, the player follows the antagonist, or rather retraces their steps, to discover their motivations and goals, across different planets. This is contrasted, then, with Mass Effect 2 and 3, where the meat of the games is composed of much more compact and exposition heavy missions with a lot of tight, polished shooting across many locations.The shooting mechanics seem to, in principle, be based on what many call a Gears of War or GTAIV cover based system. Player pops in and out of cover. However, it's pretty clunky, the player doesn't stick too well to cover and cannot navigate it very well. Add in the fact that weapons, armor, and upgrades are doled out in a traditional RPG manner, with damage stats being compared, unique drops, the skill point based system of character leveling. and a huge inventory to sort through, and one will begin to notice that things seem out of place.  It is not so much that these elements are bad in and of themselves, but more that they don't belong together. As if the developers were unsure of what kind of game they wanted Mass Effect to be.After several replays, I've come to realize that they don't do a very good job of leading up to what is supposed to be the central twist of the narrative, the big reveal about the focus of the whole trilogy, the thing to make the games all connect. Avoiding spoilers, I mean the event with the 'virtual intelligence' on Virmire late in the game. Anyone replaying will notice that the game will go so far as to basically tell, through other characters, the player directly what the narrative reveals later in a manner obviously meant to be climactic. It is again, odd, unpolished, and atypical of BioWare, much like the entirety of the game.**SPOILERS AHEAD**Besides feeling out of place and sometimes unpolished, the game has a lot of content, has mechanics that work even if feeling awkward, and manages to present an engaging narrative -- I still get rather excited when Joker commands the fleet upon Sovereign in one of the final scenes. Mass Effect's cinematic presentation is fantastic and never fails to make me feel invested in the story. (If, again, one can forgive some of the cliches like checking the body of the villain to make sure he's dead only to discover him alive or thinking the hero is dead only to have him reemerge triumphantly. I think it is possible to view these little storytelling sins sympathetically, cute little mistakes of young Mass Effect)I spent around 150 hours (100 on my Steam copy) on this game over several playthroughs. As I said at the beginning, I have a lot of issues with the series and it definitely isn't perfect. I can't deny though, that they do some things so well, and are so unique that they are games we can conclude are worth playing, worth discussing, worth evaluating.Despite the game's flaws, odd qualities, and weird inability to define itself, I have to recommend it for all it does well, for starting a great trilogy and for leading into the best game of the series: Mass Effect 2.

												Mass Effect, or as I like to call it, Extreme Drag Racing, is a game that you must play at some point in your video game career. Not because it's famous, or because it defines the sci-fi RPG genre. No; you must play this game because it has heart. It's captivating beyond anything you can fathom. I applaud all the developers who created this game, because they knew what they were doing. Does the game have flaws? Of course! What game doesn't? Have you played Fallout 4? So any excuse of, ""Oh, this game is too old"" or ""Oh, this game has bad graphics"" or even ""Oh, there are already 3 sequels to this game (almost)"" is...well inexcusable. So please, if you consider yourself a gamer of any level, or any genre, this game is one that you must add to your library of experiences. Trust me, it'll be worth it. Shepard out.

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.First of all, this is an RPG with shooter elements. Some people are playing it backward trying to make it a shooter with RPG elements. If you run and gun through this ala Gears of War, you're going to die a lot and the game will be a disappointment to you because you have the wrong preconception of what this game is about.The gameplay is fantastic, duck n cover, strategy orientated. While it does use real-time targeting, which is where your FPS skills will come into play but takes a level of strategy by pausing the action, sending out commands to teammates, and figuring out the next best tactical step.Overall: I cannot recommend this game enough to RPG fans. If you're a shooter fan and don't have an RPG background, you will be disappointed unless you stick with it and learn how the system works.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The most intriguing, thought-provoking, unique universe that exists in a video game. The most interesting and real characters you'll ever come across in a video game. You'll feel as if you know these characters personally. You'll be attached to them and by the third game, it'll hit you where it matters most.It's amazing what Bioware created and it's the only video game where your decisions will carry over for an entire trilogy.  It's quite possible that nothing like this will ever be recreated and that's perfectly okay. This particular game and the two sequels are going to be thought as of something incredibly special and it's a real shame some people won't  ever experience it.Unfortunately, the first game isn't very welcoming with it's endearing looks and gameplay. Despite this, I urge you to just push through because the story itself will get you hooked. The second and third game becomes much more accessible and in my opinion, much more fun.  Each game is extremely memorable and has so many incredible moments backed by an amazing soundtrack. From synthesizers to heart drenching piano music, the score will never leave you with a dull moment and it accompanies the characters emotions to near perfection.I highly recommend this game and the entire trilogy to anyone that wants to experience something truly special.

												Mass Effect is a Sci-Fi Third-Person Shooter/RPG. The game is set a few hundred years into the future, where humanity has discovered FTL travel and other intelligent life. You play as Commander Shepard. AI called the Geth have been attacking human colonies across the galaxy, and it's up to you to stop them. Along the way you will travel to numerous planets, meeting and helping many different species. As you go along, you unravel the mystery of why the Geth have been attacking humans. The story is absolutely amazing. One of the last few good games developed by BioWare. You make a ton of choices throughout the game, which impact both the ending, and the sequels to the game. The combat is great too. A challenging tactical third-person shooter. Each battle requires you to plan ahead, otherwise you will be overpowered very quickly. If you are playing on harder difficulties, one wrong move could mean the end of the battle. This makes for some really tense situations. There is an inventory system which allows you to customise you and your squad's armour and weapons. Plus add modifications to them. The interface for this can be annoying, especially when you have a ton of gear. But it's not too bad, and having the ability to upgrade weapons and armour is a great addition to the game. Overall, Mass Effect is an amazing Western RPG/TPS. One of my favourite games of all time. I would recommend this to anyone.			",480,88,10,76,69,2,83

												A game I had over looked until I first saw the ME2 trailer. Thought I should look into the first game. Picked it up during  Steam sale and haven't looked back. ME series has become my favorite game series to date.Now ME does show it's age. Still decent looking but I do recommend the MEUITM mod for HD textures for all the characters. It does make a world of difference in how it looks.  Excellent story. A very large selection of weapons, armor and mods for both to tweak.Combat, it's not horrible but it's not great either. It will get you thru the game. It is much better come ME2 and ME3.Only two DLC for this and Bring Down the Sky is worth installing. Pinnicle Station is umm ok. It is not needed except by those who want to play it as it adds nothing to the series. BDtS does add something to ME3 depending on choices you pick.Again great game that sets up the rest of the series nicely.			",26,1,0,6,1,0,1

												I'm very late to the Mass Effect party but man, I'm glad I eventually made it. This is simply the best Sci-fi RPG I have ever played. It's like being the star of your own TV series. Great story, Deep game universe. Great squad combat.The graphics may be slightly dated but it still looks fine running through my 1080p TV.The only criticism I have is that the 'loot box' unlock mini game is frustrating. Not hard, just frustrating. It is also pointless as after three or four quick reloads you can get through. Might as well not be there.But that in no way detracts from the total awesomeness of the game. I have had no problems running it on Win 7.  If you are into sci-fi or action RPG's you owe it to yourself to pick it up next time it pops up in a Sale.			",35,7,0,24,3,0,7

												Words don't exist to describe the scale, brilliance and emotional intelligence of this series. The relationships that are possible to build within the game are ones that you will reflect on in daily life, the choices to make will have you wondering for days what could have happened had things gone the other way. This is a game that allows you to pour yourself into it in the most organic way. This is a game in which you make friends with the characters - hear me out - to the extent that you miss them when you don't play the game for a while. Well, I imagine you would, as I never go more than a month or two without revisiting this series. Be prepared for plenty of room for improvement in Mass Effect 1. Like any game series, the first instalment leaves something to be desired of the combat and customisability, but Mass Effect 2 and 3 more than make up for that. This is my favourite game series of all time, and if you don't play it, you're missing out. Trust me.			",56,12,0,19,3,0,1

Posted: July 1, 2016
												My first 'real' RPG and my introduction to the trilogy as a whole. Mass Effect 1 is an excellent game that's aged pretty well, though there are still some hiccups here and there.Pros:-An immersive story where most choices have long-standing consequences. These range from fairly obvious galactic-scale choices to something as seemingly inconsequential as chatting with a particular NPC. While not all of these are terribly important, it really gives a sense of connectivity between games. People don't just forget how you treated them in the past.-The planetary exploration system. While it's unfortunately coupled with the horrible Mako controls (talked about in more detail below), this is one often-derided part of the game that I actually enjoyed. By having a planet in nearly every system that you can get down and explore (rather than just scanning from your ship, as in later games) makes the galaxy seem that much more massive.-The universe itself. Like most Bioware RPGs, the universe of the game is incredibly fleshed out. You'll discover hundreds of 'codex entries', which are little articles which describe how things work in-universe. Everything from spaceship design, to FTL travel, to how certain aliens function is covered at some point or another. This is all optional, of course- you don't *have* to know any of it to play the game, but it really enhances the experience when you can see how much thought went into creating this world.Cons:-The inventory system is... not great. I've seen worse, even in AAA titles, but this one is pretty bad. Your inventory will quickly become cluttered with mostly useless junk, with only a few things worth keeping. This does a good job of fleshing out the world somewhat (most things have a small description or at least a logo, making the galaxy feel bigger), but at the cost of convenience. You practically have to micromanage your squadmate's armor and guns for the first half of the game or so. Once you get access to the really good stuff, everything else becomes pretty much obsolete. Credits become kind of superfulous at the end of the game as well- I maxed out my bank on my first run without even really trying.-The dreaded Mako. It's essentially an armored vehicle for planetary exploration. Sounds great, right? The problem is that the handling is utterly atrocious. The thing lumbers around like a drunken rhinocerous, until it gets stuck on a rock outcropping and flies halfway across the map. It's all right to drive on a flat surface, but most planets are at least somewhat mountainous. There are even a few that are almost nothing but hills. Once again, this adds character to the planets at the expense of gameplay. Everything else:-The combat's nothing special. Not bad, mind you, but it doesn't do a whole lot that's really unique. Third-person shooting from behind chest-high walls with some different powers to liven things up. These range from hacking robotic enemies or weapons to 'biotic' powers which are essentially Force moves. The AI for enemies can get a bit stupid at times with characters running straight into your ambushes. -The graphics are good. A lot of the planetary environments are still beautiful, but some of the characters can get off-model mid-cutscene which makes things pretty jarring. Overall, I'd rate this a solid 9/10. Good combat, if nothing new, coupled with a wonderfully rich environment, engaging characters, and long-lasting consequences that will follow you through the trilogy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of my new personal favorite series.I played the Mass Effect triology not expecting too much. This game takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions. You fall in love with the characters around you and really feel like you are fighting for a true cause. I loved this game so much, it's now higher than the Bioshock series (which was my all time favorite). I've never cried so much when a character left or I made the wrong choice. Mass Effect 3's ending absolutely destroyed me. I completed it only a day ago and I still feel really depressed over it. In general though, this game is an extraordinary masterpiece. The character development, the choices, the gameplay and the story are just so amazing. I loved every minute of this game franchise and I recommend this to everyone. I really felt like I was Commander Shepard. I felt like I was making a difference. I felt like I was saving the world. I really felt like everything I did, everywhere I went, that people, no the WORLD was depending on me and the choices I made. I've never felt so much for a video game in a long time. 10/10 Broke my heart, made me fall in love and made me happy when I made the right choices.Thank you Bioware. Another absolutely amazing series from you.""I'll always love you Garrus""			",180,61,0,28,11,3,13

												I first started playing Mass Effect 3, then Mass Effect 2 and now finally, the first Mass Effect. Then I turned it around and played ME1,2,3 in the correct order.Seven years after it's release, it's still one of the better games. The graphics are a little outdated, but nothing disturbing. The combat mechanics and the use of biotics have been better implemented in this game than in ME2 and ME3. Too bad they didn't stick with this combat UI. Also the way that weapon upgrades work is much more extensive then with it successor games.Mass Effect one has the strongest storyline of the three games, but as a result, lacks a bit of character development. You don't get to know the characters as well as in ME2 with the loyalty missions. The dialogue is strongest in ME3.This game is easy to get by for a few bucks during sales and is definitely worth it.			",104,18,2,10,16,0,20

												Maybe the best sci-fi RPG (up there with KoTOR) and one of the best story-based computer games. The main story, written by Karpyshyn et al, shines accompanied by a wealth of developed support characters with their own backgrounds and stories. Pros:+ amazing main story+ choices DO MATTER at personal and global level+ a very large number of support characters each with corresponding stories+ variety in weapons, characteristics, skills etc+ optimal duration, not too short but also it does not drag forever+ music and sound effects+ some really awesome moments especially near the endCons:- graphics show their age - environments of side missions are repeated (especially the bases), making some quests rather boring- some occasional crashes All-in-all: A must-have game!

												Well, what can I say? Mass Effect is one of the best RPG's ever made. Many missions to do, meet a lot of aliens, kick a lot of♥♥♥♥♥ use awesome weapons and have a romance on the side. Brilliant.One down side about this one (and the rest of the series), is no controller support. You can get a mod for it though, but, thats not the point. EA should have done better on that. Also, the mechanics of the game aren't the smoothest. Combat can be rather difficult to get used to. But, this was improved later on in the series. Overall, a great game that will always be remembered.			",158,207,0,29,15,2,2

												Mass Effect is my favorite series I have ever played. You can really understand and learn about the characters in the game as you play it. It is an older game now sure, but even in 2016 it doesn't look bad at all. There are also mods to help revamp the graphics and lighting that are easy to get set up right for you. This game has pretty okay replayablity as well. Different classes with very different abilites, different choices to make throught the game. Play through at least two times to get Paragon (good cop) and Renegade (bad cop) options, and you can hit most of the dialouges this way as well. It has amazing soundtracks, voice acting, unique character races, lots of lore and story, all around a really great experiance. You can play this game and not the second or third, and still be able to have fun with the story. Though when I played this game years ago, I just had to play the second and third. To this day, to be able to sit down, play Mass Effect, import my character and thier decisions to Mass Effect 2, and import again to Mass Effect 3, and have nearly 150-200 hours put into this one character, is special. It isn't a new character the next game, it is my character. It is everything I want them to be, and the same goes to all the other characters that went with me along the way. It is making your own story with you and your team. Making relationships, friendships, working through hardships, all done together. I absolutely recommend this game, and the entire series. Roleplay, storytelling, engaging characters and enviornment, everything makes it special. 10/10 experiance with my time with it all			",27,2,0,4,1,0,2

Although this, the first installment of the excellent Mass Effect trilogy, can be a little slow to get going, it's not so much about the action but the universe and its occupants; really well realised characters in a fleshed out world.  It really is the characters and 'lore' that makes this game.  Just as well, as much time is spent conversing with these characters, discovering ancient secrets of the galaxy, in a well told story of galactic anihilation.  And luuuurve...			",81,2,0,8,3,0,2

												*played and completed on XBox, hence no played time*Mass Effect is, for me, and many others, one of the best games they've ever played. Coupled with Mass Effect 2, the story is just wonderful and engrossing, funny and clever, genre-defining at times.Mass Effect is one of those games you ""need"" to play. It's not so much a game as it is a wonderfully told story.The story is great, the gameplay is intuitive and creative, and very infrequently dissociates the player from the game.

												Mass Effect is brilliant. It has that incredible ""feel"" that I constantly look for in games.The combat is often turned down by many players as they find it difficult to deal with and boring, but I think that it's a nice addition to this game's originality! It's a lot different than combat in most games, but that doesn't make it bad -  at all -  for me.The music. Oh man, the music. Whenever I hear for example ""Vigil"", ""Vampire Ride"", ""Liara's World"", past the halfway of ""Uplink"" or any Citadel song, I feel great. The amazing music is a major part of ME's memorable atmosphere, though not the only one.The galaxy is huge! There are several systems and beneath those star clusters to explore. On the planets' surface, you drive the 100% badass Mako. The vehicle has got positive and negative feeback - I don't quite understand how anyone could diss that beast!Lots of characters from several different interesting species. I love every single one! In fact, at first I was totally annoyed and frustrated by the small ball-y Volus, but now I always grin at them! They're so silly!I grew to really care about and like the squad mates. The alien ones, at least - they're the most interesting! There is a tough guy from the Krogan species - they always remind me of toads for some reason.  In the summer, there are some toads and frogs in my pond out in the yard - I should name one of them Wrex! Gotta love him!Definitely one of the very best games I've ever played. The spacey sci-fi world is marvelous. The only space game that I would consider even better is Star Control II, a classic from -92. But ME is a certain number two!And there are two MORE of these games! How much better can this enjoyment get?			",46,4,0,3,2,0,1

												Out of the 3, Mass Effect 1 had the greatest skill tree design. It also had the best gun design with the overheating instead of using thermal clips (IMO)Its the game that started it all. 9 years later and its still an amazing journey, from start to finish. If youve never played this game before I seriously suggest you do so. It becomes part of you.			",116,4,15,14,11,2,8

												Unlike most people, i think Mass Effect is the best series among Mass Effect Trilogy. From rich story, have solid RPG system, great world creation just like from 70's to 80's sci-fi and i enjoy every second of playing Mass Effect.I can't deny the fact that the gameplay is confusing for new player, lazy PC port and few minors problem. But, those problem can be resolved easily.I proudly can say that Mass Effect is one of the game of all time made by Bioware (other than SW:KOTOR and DA:O) that i beat this game 5 times (Don't mind my gameplay hours recorded on steam)If you're big fans of this trilogy series, you should buy/see :- ""The Art of Mass Effect Universe""- ""Mass Effect Library Edition Volume 1"" and ""Mass Effect Library Edition Volume 2""- ""Mass Effect: Revelation"", ""Mass Effect: Ascension"" and ""Mass Effect: Retribution""100/100, would play it again and again.

												Mass Effect is quite possibly the most amazing game ever written for a video game, recalling many of the best elements from some of the greatest works of the sci-fi genre and putting you in an almost ""Oblivion""-like level of control over the world. You could spend dozens of hours simply exploring unknown worlds and building your fortune that way while shirking the main story altogether if you choose. But if you don't have all the time in the universe to enjoy this one, the main story is not too long. In fact, I honestly wish it were much longer, but that was the sacrifice made for the open-ended freedom of exploration the player is given. One will most likely spend upwards of 50 hours just exploring the galaxies and discovering all of the tiny stories within the story that really flesh this universe out. Plus, there are many different ways to play the game which will command you to replay it over again just to see all of the what-if's and enjoy mastering all of the various class sort.

												Mass Effect shows it's age in many respects, but holds up surprisingly well - after all, it is almost time for it's ten year anniersary! Despite a somewhat annoying combat system, excruciatingly slow run speed, my mistake in picking Infiltrator when the almost all confrontations were face-to-face, et al et al... There's something special here. Potential.

												The first Mass Effect is one of the games that make me want a third, neutral recommendation option here on Steam. On one hand, I love this game, I've finished it 3-4 times - recently here on Steam (in preparation for Andromeda) and a few times using the boxed version and while I enjoy the game a lot now, I remember my first time playing it and I also remember dropping the game after an hour or two, simply because it didn't appeal to me at the time. I came back after I finished playing ME 2 (which I loved the moment I started playing), because I wanted to fill in some leftover plot holes, made by skipping the first game. I'm glad I did it that way, if I forced myself to play ME1 first, I might've really hated the game and it would make me skip out the whole series as I would assume the games are all ""bad"" or they don't appeal to me, because let's face it - ME 1 has many flaws.Let's list some cons:The first thing you'll notice - only low resolution options and no borderless support (and I didn't find a way to enable it even with usage of external programs), also the graphics are rather mediocre for 2007 (use 1st Bioshock for comparison).Most interiors are copy&pasted, recycled content - get ready to go through the same exact building 20 timesExteriors are not exactly original either, seems like they used some sort of random gen script for most planets, then altered the textures, placed that one building I mentioned above, put one of 3 types of enemies inside, scattered like 2-3 other ""events"" across the map (usually mining or a container with items) and now and then they added a ""quest"" which involves Admiral Heckett contacting you after you fly to a new location, saying something generic like ""hurr durr there's a bunch of scientists needing your help, we rely on you, Shepard""Combat is very clunky - I hope they fired whoever came up with the idea of snipers that instakill you and hit you every time. Krogans and some Geth that run at you no matter what are not very fun either.Combat on higher difficulties is difficult not because the enemies would get smarter, it's because of the mechanics above. You still get one-shot, just more often.Enemy variety - 80% of the time you fight the Geth, 10% Humans, the rest is split among the other races (mostly Rachni, Batarians, Krogans...)Class and quest/kill reward balancing is awfulApparently the same balancing team did class balancing, as some classes are obviously a lot stronger than others.Bugs (and I don't mean the big bugs - Rachni, I mean actual bugs), getting stuck is not that uncommon. Sometimes you're not even sure what's a bug and what's a feature. For example - there's a quest on citadel that makes you go find 21 NPCs that are scattered around the city. Not only the place is huge, it's also really confusing as the map is pretty much useless. 'Till this day I still don't know where the 21st NPC is (or if the quest bugged for me). I'll never know what the quest reward is (probably something worthless, like 500 credits)The voice acting is 50/50 either great or terrible. The female Shepard voice actress is awesome, while the male actor sounds very stiff and boring.Why even play the game with all those flaws you ask?Well, the story is amazing. Not the exploration side quests - let's not talk about those. But the actual main story is great, all the backstory on every race and every individual makes you really interested in what happened and what happens next. While I think that Bioware is a rather ""lazy"" studio when it comes to game development (I'm looking at you, Dragon Age 2), I'd say that their storywriters are among the best in the industry. Also most importantly - this game is the prequel to the actual Mass Effect game - Mass Effect 2. Mostly everything that was wrong with ME1 is fixed in ME2 and while they are both very good games, ME2 is way more ""new-gen-player"" friendly, easier, more modern and fun to play. So that is my recommendation - play through ME2 first and if you enjoy the game, you'll be eager to play ME1 as well and if you don't enjoy its gameplay, you'll at least enjoy the story, that's for sure. I think the flaws of ME1 that some of us overlooked back in 2007 didn't age well, nowadays we seek more refined games - like ME2. However, the story is just as good as it used to be, so it's definitely worth a playthrough. ",832,308,26,103,88,10,134

 An exciting Space Adventure  9.3/10Now I know this game is quite old, but I have finally been able to sit and dive into the deep space of Mass effect. From the vast amount of planets to explore, to the commanding of my squad to take on the ventures unknown, I had one heck of a time.In the beginning I jumped in being prepared to get through the game as quickly as possible. Now it is not the best way to play this game, even though I had that mindset, I found myself veering off course to the different side quests the universe had to offer. Right from the start, you are given a variety of choices in dialogue in which molded your character with the personality you wanted to give. Now being the person I am I will always be the that knight in shining armour, but the choices were still very hard to choose from, sacrificing others for the good of mankind, or maybe saving a whole species but risking another catastrophe of war, it was a very hard decision.Putting aside the dialogue for a moment, there was still a lot of decision making when it came to the combat. Different weapons, with different upgrades and stats, then choosing if to keep the best weapon for yourself (of course you do) or giving it to your squad members. I have to admit I did spend a lot of time deciding which upgrades were best on which guns to make certain situations easier for me, some bullets did better against synthetics while others organics, and at the time of the fight you could just decide by thinking  Which enemy have I came across the most? Im not saying this a life or death decision but it really. REALLY. helped in some such situations but yeah I like combat to go smoothly when Im involved.Overall this game is a must play. I would advise getting it for the cheap price it is now than the full retail price it once was.			",69,2,0,5,7,0,1

												This game really did it for me. While not flawless the gameplay experience it gave me was among the best I have yet to encounter in my gaming 'career'. Apart from my first playthrough of Final Fantasy 7 and, of course, Mass Effect 2 nothing comes to my mind that holds up in comparison.The premise does not seem that extraordinary at first glance. You play as Commander Shepard (either male or female, your choice) and basically you are going to prevent the annihilation of every major civilisation in the galaxy. Pretty standard so far. But the world building in this game is so complex, so detailled it blew me away.Every now and then you get entries in your Codex where you can read about the many spacefaring races, some important historic events or the different technologies you are utilizing in the game. I loved how they put that much effort into something many gamers won't even bother to read because it is not important at all if you just want to progress the story.What really makes the game come to life is its host of memorable characters. There are innumerable people you encounter, many of which can be spoken with, often offering multiple dialogue-tree options. Some of those will join your team and become your companions. Since I engaged all of my companions in conversations regularly between missions I started to really care about them. They are fully fleshed out personalities, each with his own motivations and wishes.The main villains, the Reapers, are mostly only hinted at. But you never forget them and their looming presence in the background gives the story a dire urgency. The Reapers' henchmen you are battling are nothing grand but they serve their purpose well.The gameplay combines elements of roleplaying, shooter and exploration games and the result gave me great joy. There were some rather unpleasant moments while traversing the surface of the more mountainous planets but thankfully there weren't that many of them. The majority of the game is spent either engaging NPCs in conversations or shooting at  enemies. Both aspects are done very well, although the shooter portion got a tiny bit repetitive at the end. But since I did every available sidequest and played almost nonstop for several days until I was done that might be my own fault.The skillsystem is solid and you get tons of loot to equip your characters with.There are several occasions when you have to make a decision that will have repercussions in the later games. Some are more personal and affect if a specific character will survive to come back in the sequels. Some have a galactic impact. In one case you decide between exterminating an entire race or giving them another chance. All of these moments came back to me vividly while playing Mass Effect 2 and being confronted with the consequences of my own actions.			",46,23,0,21,2,0,4

												That's the one game which presents the new era of the games where story has became importest part of games, since Half-Life 2's success. In some cases it's evolution (story, enviroment, graphics, level-design, characters, quests) of SW: KoTOR with it own plot and universe, but in level-up system and battles it's devolution. Back in mid 2000's it was popular to add vehicles to the games, but if you're going to play Mass Effect I'd recommend to you finish the side quests and main story first and then try land missions and DLCs when you'll play with another backstory/class/gender etc. Otherwise, land missions can just make you rage on that game with the same type of buildings what you visit, same missions, high mountaint and Mako's driving controls. If you play on Normal and you think that the game is ez pz, the end battle will change your mind and test what you learnt with that fight system.P.S. Also, about DLCs. First DLC you can obtain for free from Origin site, but the other one is illegal to be installed with Steam-version. Anyway, you know what to do... :)			",320,61,13,40,22,1,50

												First of all, this game is nearly 8 years old (as of now). In newer machines it’ll require some tweaking to acquire the best results. Some things are unavoidable though, for instance, the max resolution is 720p, but other issues can be improved. In my experience the “motion blur” setting didn’t work out well: Shepard was always “shaking”. Other issue was the V-sync setting: no matter what I did, it simply wouldn’t work, the game was always at 62~63 fps and I would see screen-tearing literally all the time. Luckily there’s an easy solution for this: I simply activated triple-buffering in the GPU settings, overriding the game settings (then I activated V-sync in the game settings and restarted it: problem solved). Another issue was the Steam Overlay: in order for it to work with the game, I needed to open Steam as an administrator (Win 8.1).Now that the technical issues are taken care of, let’s see the pros and cons:Pros:•	Massive game: at least 30 hours of gameplay are guaranteed.•	Over the top replayability value: you can play as Renegade, Paragon or any mixture of both. Your choices will affect not only the story of ME 1, but also the subsequent titles of the franchise.•	The game is funny. Although Shepard appears to be serious, there’s a subtle humor to many of his lines/actions.•	Outstanding voice-work: Seth Green (Joker), Keith David (Captain Anderson), and Mark Meer (Shepard) are incredible. Overall, the whole cast is consistent.•	You can punch a NPC for no apparent reason.•	Engaging story and interesting characters/classes/settings: Reapers, Protheans, Quarians, Krogans, Keepers, Turians, Volus, The Citadel, The Council, Mass Relays, etc… there’s a whole new sci-fi mythology to be found.•	Great graphics for 2008: even though the graphics might seem outdated nowadays, they were really impressive back in 2008.•	You’ll get to drive the best off-road vehicle ever: the Mako.Cons:•	You can’t romance everyone.•	You’ll get lost in Ilos, no matter what you do.•	In the beginning you’ll have a hard time finding your significant ones inside the Normandy.•	You’ll be annoyed by Shepard’s lack of endurance training (he can’t sprint for 200 meters without getting exhausted).

												""As Commander Shepard, you lead an elite squad on a heroic, action-packed adventure throughout the galaxy.""My very first experience with Mass Effect was when I saw the cover of the third game on a shelf when browsing around a shop. I have heard good things on the internet about the franchise and since I couldn't find any copies of the games, I brought this one. When I got home I started up my PS3 and played the game. Obviously I felt a bit lost at first and knew that some things were missing because I hadn't played the previous games, but the experience sure was fun. I then purchased the other two games and a bit of DLC as time went by from the PlayStation Store and played the entire franchise from start to finish. It quickly became one of my favorite gaming franchises. Recetly I bought Mass Effect 1 for PC since it was on sale. I managed to get the two DLCs for free and installed a mod that enchanced the game's overall quality and textures. The perfomance was vastly improved when compared to the console. Instead of the game being locked on 30FPS, I now get around 80 to 130 frames-per-second. So, is this game so good that it was worth a re-purchase? Yes, it is. It's been months since I touched the series and being back sure feels good. Unlike last time, I kind of rushed in order to get to the third game, but this time around I'm going slow. I've already spent forty hours in this and I'm still not finished. I'm taking my time to explore every corner and quest that the game provides. Pros:- You can create your own Shepard and modify his or hers facial features, background and even select a Class. Vanguard is my favorite, but it all depends on taste after all.- The story is great. One of the best out there. No wonder this game was a hit back on 2007. - You control your character at 100%; you make your own choices and the story is tailored by how you play. Most of your choices lead to consequences that will impact future games. - You will either love or hate your companions. They are great characters and will surely provide you aid in combat. Each one of them has a different role, so be sure to think before heading out.- It has one of the best voice-acting out there. Jennifer Hale is the best.- Being a 2007 most computers and laptops nowadays can handle this game with ease and it still looks amazing ten years later. BioWare sure knew what they were doing with their engine back then.- The Mako can be fun and there's some variety put into the side-quests in terms of looks and feel.- This game only came to be thanks to KOTOR, so obviously you will find some nice Star Wars references here and there. Besides those, there are also some other Easter Eggs and even references to older games and subjects. - The RPG and Shooter elements were combined rather nicely. You can select all sorts of gear for your character and companions.- Great soundtrack.- And many others...Cons:- For some people the game might feel outdated... for whatever reason. Most people prefer ME2 and ME3. I personally find all of them good at their own pace.- It's a bit hard to create a good-looking Shepard... but not as hard as some other BioWare games that's for sure.- If careless, you will be blocked from certain choices that will eventually ruin your experience.- The AI isn't amazing. Some enemies will sometimes stare at the walls and your companions will sometimes shoot at you rather than the enemies themselves.- Some people can find the Mako a bore due to its clunky physics and the familiar feeling of most side-quests. There is also a lack of variety in music choice when it comes to these quests.- Some backtracking during missions.- Sometimes the DLC can can be removed by itself. Be sure to save a copy of their installers and a copy of your save files somewhere. However, your computer might consider these save files as malware.- Little variety put into the DLCs. Pinnacle Station feels like it was done by a completely different team.- Even though you have several dialogue choices, some of them can lead to the exact same outcome.- And others.WARNING: The Steam version DOES NOT include any of the DLC. You can easily find it for free just by browsing it on Google with no issues.			",31,7,0,5,1,0,0

												I played 1, 2, and 3. The ending of 3 was a massive disappointment, but for me it was mainly because over time I grew extremely emotionally attached to most of my crew. I seriously don't want to let go, and I'm hoping Mass Effect Andromeda will fix the mess along with my feels (I doubt that). But overall this series is really good. I have never been so emotionally attached to video game characters in my life. And Tali'Zorah....

												What if I told you there was a science-fiction roleplaying game where you lead a vastly diverse crew to stop the Council's golden agent after he goes rogue?Now, what if I told you that in said game, you make choices that can drastically effect multiple boss fights and just how diverse your crew is?Now stay with me, what if I told you in said game, your dialogue tree has VOICED dialogue provided by Mark Meer (if you are playing male) or the lovely Jennifer Hale (if you are playing female, obviously.)Okay, okay, sound interesting? Now how about this... What if I told you that this is Part 1 to a fully thought out and innovative trilogy where you can import not only your saves, but your very character (from your choices to your appearance) from the first game?What if I told you this game also has low enough specs to be played on most laptops? Seriously, if you're a RPG fan and you haven't played this yet because the controversy of the third game's ending has discouraged you: play this trilogy anyways. This is a lore-filled game with a fully narrated codex. A fully narrated codex!!! You can spend hours just listening to the codex alone!Seriously, the entire trilogy will provide you hundreds of hours of immersion in a well crafted universe.Just buy this if you like roleplaying games of any sort.

												Only buy this game on Steam if it's on sale. Otherwise, buy it on Origin. Mass Effect 3 is only available there, as well as the DLCs for ME 2.If you buy this game here, you can't simply use the cd-key to activate it there. You need to get in contact with Origin support so they do it for you. But it works.It's one of the best RPGs ever and you should totally play it, but understand that this game is a series in which every game matters for the next ones, so you might want to play it over Origin from the start.

With its incredible story and terrific universe, it provides hours of action packed fun that will leave you eager for more when the game ends. It does carry some issues, but they are so minute that if you discover them, you will instantly forgot about them.

												Mass Effect is a good game, but not as good as you would expect from review rating. In the start, it's even boring. I nearly wanted to quit it – with all those lengthy dialogues, walking around doing nothing, shooting nobody...With lousy controls, inconvenient maps, generic exploration missions and awful combat system, you almost want to hate it, but THEN, in the second third of the game, the story gets better, creating emotional attachment to the characters, revealing sinister plot of epic proportion and pushing you to make game-changing moral choices, you're getting more and more excited and want to find out what's going to happen next. After the final battle you're like ""WOW! That was something!"" But is a great story enough to define this game as great? I don't think so. Every other aspect in this game is bad or mediocre.  So I give ME solid 7.5/10.PROS:- Great story (but only after the Citadel intro), although it's too anthropocentric and Commander Sheppard is unrealistically important and popular for a single soldier- Flexible and vast character appearance customisation options- Mods that make the game substantially better (e.g., MEUITM mod)NEUTRAL:- Alternative scenarios, choices matterCONS:- Homogenous textures with poor attention to detail (it might not be possible at the time, but still it doesn't add up to a good experience)- There are times in main missions when autosave feature is not working the entire mission; if you forget to save (which might be a disabled feature, too), you risk starting all over again, which means 10-15 minutes of repeated gameplay- Awful Mako (vehicle) controls, often it goes the opposite direction from what you're stearing it to. Combine it with disabled autosave and falling off the cliff and there you go – repeat the whole mission again- Awful combat system: there are covers, which both you and the AI should be using, but, since everyone (including your squad members) are just chaotically running all over the place, it's just easier to rush forward and shoot everybody without thinking about any tactics- Initial weapons are awfully inaccurate- Inconvenient inventory system (typical RPG thing)- Unbalanced credits system: short of money in the beginning, millionnaire towards the end (another typical RPG thing); but, IMO, it's not worth to purchase anything anyway, you get all you need from looting- Generic exploration missions on another planets with mountainous terrain – it's up and down over the mountains all the time- Mini-map kind of sucks, because it functions only as a radar and it doesn't depict distance properly- Right turn doesn't work sometimes, you have to turn the camera left to enable right turn again- There are no markers for side missions on galaxy map; you have to read the mission description to know where you should go and it's not very convenient- You need to create an EA account to get the free DLCAnyway, with so many faults, I still think this game is worth your time and money, because with such flexible and vast story it was something unique at the time, earning ME a place in the history of video games.P.S. There is a way to enable gamepad support. Check out the guide section!			",139,38,1,27,5,2,24

												I tried Mass Effect once. Couldnt see what all the fuss was about. Went back to it. Gave it another chance. Got totally sucked in. Finished all 3 games now. Mass Effect, whilst being the roughest around the edges, is still an excellent game. Shooting mechanics overlayed with the ability to momentarily pause and direct your customised comrades make for exceedingly deep choices. Thats before you even get to the game world, which is so fantastic the races and places will stay with you long after you finish it. A sci fi masterpiece of a novel where you can write your own story. Be aware, Mass Effect 3 is not available on Steam. You will require Origin to play, but it's still worth it (trust me, I hate Origin).			",472,110,17,68,43,3,97

												After seeing snippets of Mass Effect 2, I knew I had to play from the beginning. This game is a great start to this three part space opera. The story is deceptively simple. You are Commander Shephard and you must save the galaxy. As you complete the simple story you will have to make decisions that will flesh out the story and in some ways decide on who lives and who dies. Apart from the main story, there are numerous side missions that help develop relationships with fellow characters or influence what happens in the sequels. There is tons of replay value due to the fact that there are different ways to handle various situations in the game. The graphics have aged well, I think. The characters are all memorable. You won't like these characters, you will LOVE them. The relationships you build (or tear down) will follow you in the games to come. Now for the negatives, and I had to squint to see them. I personally found the exploration tedious. The planets you go to are all very detailed, with descriptions about their resources and history, but driving the vehicle to go through some of the rough terrain got to be annoying at times. Thats really the only negative I could think of. A great game that should be tried by everybody.			",114,169,0,22,10,3,18

												Mass Effect is one of the best single player games in any genre that you can play for the best part of a decade. It helped to redefine the genre, and is a must play for fans of rpgs, sci-fi and shooters alike. The graphics are slightly outdated but can be improved with mods. Voice acting is top notch, sound effects are great and the sound track is fantastic. The gameplay is truly outstanding and helped to redefine the genre. The choices you make in the game have legitimate consequences, altering the story as you progress. And what a story it is, full of depth and intrique as you embark on a mission that will decide the fate of the galaxy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The game is both challenging and rewarding. The role playing elements of this game is deep enough to keep you invested and with such great characters and companions this game feels more real. The graphics still looks great. If you love fun and well written Sci-fi RPGs then you will enjoy Mass Effect. I can't recommend this game enough.   ",2391,978,75,299,289,29,372

If you like third-person shooters with RPG elements, side quests, space, choose-your-dialogue games, flirting with aliens, and games with fleshed out lore for its world, Mass Effect is for you.   I like that I can develop my Shepard the way I like and pick my teammates and how to interact with them outside of missions.   I haven't played ME2 or ME3 yet, but I definitely plan to!

												Ah, Mass Effect. The franchise that has entranced me the most out of everything I've ever played in my life.I remember picking this series up around the time ME2 was already out and people were raving about ""Lair of the Shadow Broker"". Its final DLC ""Arrival"" had been announced and was days away from release. The first 2 games were both on sale and I can honestly say they were the best $40 I've ever spent.Right off the bat, what captured me about Mass Effect is the soundtrack. Haunting and alien with a strong 80s Sci-fi vibe. combined with the incredibly immersive visuals of the battle-ravaged landscape of Eden Prime, the first planet we visit during the story.The visuals themselves have a slightly rough edge to them, could be described as ""slick retro"", but in my view this is what increases ME1's charm and for some reason heightens immersion. Jack Wall & Sam Hulick are a magical team who have pulled out all the stops to truly bring the gameworld to life with the gift of their music.The lore is rich, fascinating and immersive beyond compare. There is enough material to fully supply 100 Mass Effect sequels, because the universe is vast and knows no boundaries. No matter how far-fetching some ideas or concepts might appear, there is no such thing as ""unbelievable"" when it comes to something so unknowable and alien like Space. Noone knows what's out there.The Mass Effect series is set 170 years into the future, where within the past 30 years humanity has discovered we are not alone in the universe after all. We are but one of numerous sapient species in the Milky Way, and they all have strong opinions too. Yet the galaxy is filled with secrets and one particularly horrifying secret is due to be irreversibly uncovered and put every race in peril. For there are monsters hidden in the dark corners of the Milky Way, and those monsters intend to wipe out all organic life as we know it.Gameplay-wise, ME1 isn't as fluid as other modern shooters. It certainly has its clunky issues and is a little cumbersome at times. Most optional side-quests conclude in identical-looking indoor structures regardless of what planet they're on, making them awfully tedious. The handling of the planetary exploration vehicle, the MAKO, leaves something to be desired, having been described by an in-game character as boasting ""handling like a tipsy rhino"". I'd say that's being generous.The weapon overheating feature, while designed to add a sense of shooter realism, is more irritating than immersive and will infuriate some people. The inventory system is a primitive, overly cluttered mess and will most certainly irritate some players to no end, but once you get the hang of it you can mostly ignore it.But the punchline is: as clumsy as some game systems are, you can't help but overlook them because the back story will have hooked its claws into you too deep, that you will not be able to stop playing. On a grander scale, overall level design is absolutely breath-taking. Landing on a red moon and looking up to see its main planet covering most of the sky like an angry giant will indeed take your breath away.You're suddenly no longer in your own house, but on an alien world light years away. Driving along the Prothean Skyway on Feros and stopping to soak in the visuals will transport you to 2183 AD. Seeing the Prothean spires stretching beyond atmospheric visibility will project images in your mind, not of a haunted, abandoned world but of a majestic technologically superior empire spanning across the galaxy in all its glory.I ended up completing Mass Effect 1 within 3 days (I took my time) and when I was done, I imported my savegame into Mass Effect 2 and was blown to the stratosphere. Oh yes, hang onto your saves, because you will need them to continue your story in Mass Effect 2. Actions have consequences, and they will shape world details around you.I can go on like this all night, but my point will remain the same. Mass Effect is worth every cent and every second you put in it. I was not a sci-fi fan before Mass Effect; I am now. Even if you're not a fan of elaborate fiction, you can't help but let your mind roam wild when your eyes feast on the stunning futuristic visuals of the Citadel - the cultural galactic center, or the haunting lost alien world of Ilos.""Andromeda"", the 4th installment of the Mass Effect series is less than a year away from release, and I don't doubt for a second it will not disappoint. If you're not a Mass Effect fan, now it's time to become one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												With all honesty, this game is still an amazing franchise to get into. Doesn't matter the age; like a fine wine, it gets better with time. No need to do second plays with different choices - what you pick you should stick with, and you shouldn't have to look things up: be surprised at your outcomes!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Overall, good game, but since it's a bit older, don't expect inovation. A must play if you want to play the whole trilogy. Graphics are a bit older, but the story is better than most of the games out there. Since it is an rpg, some of the missions will be frustrating beacause of difficulty (not the story related - they are scaled well, maybe a bit too easy. If you get into the game and story, the trilogy will reward you handsomly for your choices. There's a great feeling when you run into an old friend from previous game (s) - for example: meeting Wrex again in ME2.If you want to make progress in paragon/renegade system, immediatelly invest in charm/intimidate as the game will open these dialog options ONLY if you invest in them, not like in ME 2 & 3.One more VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION: If your gameplay lags a lot and you get very low fps altho you have a machine that's way beyond minimum specs, try disabling your firewall. It helped me to play this game as it was supposed to be played 60+fpsEnjoy :)			",71,25,4,16,10,0,11

												Mass Effect Review:Mass Effect triology is one of the best sci-fi RPG in gaming, and if you plan to play it, do start from the first game.Pros:Character & story establishmentchoices matterDifferent races each with their own back storiesLots of enemy types to have variety in combat. The squad you choose, the skills/ class they are will actually matter on the battlefield. Also the skills you decide to buy.Epic Story which goes on for 3 games.You are a commander, you lead your squad. It actually feels like having the resposibility of leadership. Each class has unique abilitiesTalking with Npcs, main quest or just conversation never felt boring, its interesting to hear about new things.Main story gets interesting with every progression towards the story.Cons:Every weapon is a energy weapon. It doesnt run out of ammo, only overheats. This is fixed in ME2&3. Its not a problem, it only makes combat a little boring.Centered camera when not in combat.ElevatorsSide quests are mostly boring [mostly fetch quests], so if you want to play the first game for the awesome story, just stick with the main missionsWeapons restricted to classes.

												The Mass Effect series is by far one of my favorite RPG games to date. Since I've started the series by playing the third game first and then the other two games, getting used to the lower graphics and the different controls was a bit of a challenge, but once I've gotten used to it I really enjoyed the game.You get to know a lot of different characters, you are faced with a lot of difficult choices that actually have an impact on the game's progress. It has everything a good RPG needs to have to be enjoyable.I've first played these games on my PlayStation console, but I definitely will be playing the first two on steam again, since they have a high replay value.I can only recommend this series to everyone who enjoys playing RPGs.

												One of the best games ever. Period.The story, the world, the history - everything is so well written and executed. There is a lot of backstory in this game and if you take time to read/listen to everything - you are going to enjoy every single second of Mass Effect and you will remember this game for many many years.I just finished my second playthrough (the first one was 4 years ago). Mass Effect doesn't age. it's still beautiful even after 9 years of its release.There are a few things that can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥(like driving a Mako through a rocky terrain or repetitive level design of facilities on different planets), but apart from that - it's a gem in every aspect. The developers have done a great job at making every planet look different. The skies are just beautiful (with so many stars and planets). Eh. Love it.Mass Effect is one of those games where you feel sad after finishing it.			",387,104,12,43,37,8,62

												I cannot recomend this game enough.Its a storytelling marvel and something which stands as a testament of how games are an artform.You will get drawn to the universe and you will care about the people and what happens.But enough praise, the bad stuff:The vehicle section of the game is horrible.The combat is sub-par but serves its purpose.The inventory system and its management is a bit too old school (ie. messy).Get the game, play it through. Keep your saves.Go get mass effect 2 and play it using your saves.You will literaly be missing out if you dont give this a go.PS: giving it a go means finishing at least the first mission which is a bit boring.

												A space opera epic with many scenes you'd expect to find in a movie like this and a couple that you don't see that often. The cast of characters, setting and “cinematics” are, for me, the games' primary strength. On normal difficulty game play never seemed to get above casual. Too many filler side missions that pad things out a bit. Flawed game, Fun movie.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Join Commander Shepard and his/her crew of humans and aliens to save the galaxy from a galactic threat. It's a Third-Person RPG Shooter that vaguely feels like Deus Ex at first, because weapons are fairly inaccurate to start with, and Shepard doesn't want to take a diazepam because your arms sway all over the damn place while trying to aim with a sniper. But soon you specialize in what weapon you think you're best with after killing enemies, completing quests, etc. with skill points you earn as you level up, as well as other misc passive & active abilities. Shepard's crew on the other hand, often come with biotic and tech abilities to help you in battle, and even in things like hacking devices.The weapons also work on an overheating system, as in they have unlimited ammo, but if you don't control your bursts well enough, they will overheat and you will be unable to use them for several seconds. There are weapon mods to reduce heat weapons produce, as well as other useful things, and ammo mods to inflict more damage, bypass shields, poison, etc.Along your quest, you can choose to either be a saintly paragon, or a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, or somewhere in between with the whole moral choice system, and the more you use the charm or intimidate options in dialog, the more levels you unlock in the charm/intimidate skill tree in which to spend your skill points in and unlock more dialog options.Then there's the epic world map of the galaxy, in which you can continue your main quest, or pull an Elder Scrolls and do ungodly amounts of sidequesting and explore everywhere. Usually when you land a on planet, you do so with a space buggy called the Mako, which is equipped with thrusters, a machine gun, and a cannon. You explore a fairly large surface area of the planets you land on, optionally collecting things such as veins and salvage to earn exp and money. Then there's the main point of the planet, which usually involves entering a facility, or cave, or just wipeing out a camp of hostiles.You collect lots of weapons, armors, weapon mods & ammo mods, along your way, which are magically transferred to your inventory after killing enemies, then theres a bunch of shops to buy and sell from. By the end of the game, I had several million credits, and 2 weapon mods to prevent overheating to the point where my weapons never overheated, I love when older RPGs do broken stuff like that.The main things I hate about the game are the sound glitches, and my CPU fan going ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at all times due to the game being punishing on your CPU. But thats just some technical problems, it's a great game and it runs fine besides that, I only ever crashed once.You can also import your save into the sequel, Mass Effect 2, and have a bunch of story elements impacted, as well as start with some bonus stuff. More games like this need to do that.			",472,122,7,72,33,5,42

												After playing Dragon Age for a bit some years ago (I don't know why I quit? I had better things to do I guess) I decided to try out another infamous title from Bioware: Mass Effect. I had no idea what to expect and just went in blank. I entered a world full of Turians, Salarians, and a lot of other races I was quite sure I would never remember. But as the game progressed, I became quite fond of Turians. I met my first Volus along the way. I learned what a Specter was and what was expected of me when I became one. And the conversations. I love the conversations. Instead of watching a scene and waiting until you can play again, you decide how this conversation will end! Will your persuade your teammate to cooperate or will they leave you when you decide to yell at them? It's your decision.This is a game I'll never forget, and I'll make sure to give Dragon Age another go!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not much playtime yet on steam but I've played quite a lot on PS3 (90 hours or so) and the steam version is like that but with better graphics, fps, and loading times.It's a great sci-fi game and it's filled with a lot of exploration, backstory, and lore.The rpg elements are ok-ish and the combat's not polished compared to newer games, but the shooting is serviceable, not absolutely horrible. Just not up to today's standards I'd say.It's more star trek than any star trek game, because you get to be captain of a ship, make decisions that impact storylines and your relationship with your crew, pursue romantic interests, and explore plenty of planets (though admittedly they are sometimes kinda empty and the buildings are reused very often). And if you really like lore and backstories in your games, this game has plenty and a lot of them are fully voiced. What mass effect really does well is immersing you into its world.Would definitely recommend this game to anyone even remotely interested in sci fi.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Basically a spiritual sequel to Star Control 2, with ground combat replacing ship combat. It's obvious that BioWare was heavily inspired by that classic, even though Mass Effect manages to build its own unique and impressive mythos. This game is extremely fun all around, though exploration and interaction with the various extraterrestrial races is perhaps the high point of the entire game. I'm of the opinion that this game would have worked as a standalone title without the sequels that followed it, though the sequels are good in their own right. Regardless, this is worth playing, especially now at such a discounted price. Recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is where it all started.I have hundreds of hours logged in this trilogy, both on Steam and on Origin  where I inevitably ported my Mass Effect 2 save files to, but I'll explain in my review of that  and I'm still not done with this series, and with its characters. Mass Effect means a lot to me, both as a game and as a story.The controls can be janky - especially if you're playing as an Infiltrator - and you'll quickly find yourself watching the same npc animations over and over as you progress through the game that's something that Bioware is quite infamous for, you'll find it in pretty much all of their games but as you immerse yourself in the story it all becomes superficial.There's so much you can do in this game, including optional quests that have impact on the story in the sequels (nothing too substantial unfortunately, they're more like easter eggs/cameos, but still nice to get nonetheless). I did a completionist run a few months back with my first male Shepard Uriel, and it was well worth the time and energy I put into it - though I wouldn't reccomend it for a first time player. Mass Effect has its flaws, both in its story and in its gameplay. But there's no denying that it's a classic, and that its beloved by a lot of people, including myself. It's worth it, trust me.

												11/10This is my favorite series of all time as far as RPG's go and almost one of my favorite period. However, it is a little dated looking now, so.. here is something to help with that.(For actual review skip to HERE! typed below)http://www.moddb.com/mods/mass-effect-1-new-texture-updatesimprovements-modCheck out that site, it will have you up and running with far improved shaders and graphics. Also, DLC!http://help.ea.com/en/article/mass-effect-bring-down-the-sky-dlc-redemption/In order to get the end DLC PS you will need to register your key with Origin. I hear rumor that it's automatically included with the game now and no longer a need to get the trillogy. I can't confirm this though. as I always move my back up file that contains the DLC I got wayyy back before EA nuked every available link for it... So I import my back up copy. You wont miss anything without the PS DLC as it's a very short run, and doesn't transfer anything to the next game. Bringing Down The Sky however is fantastic and I highly recomend it. Make sure to launch the game once before trying to install it. I have far more hours in this game than STEAM reports, as I had been playing it long before they started keeping track, and now play it through Origin since steam doesn't get updates for the series to keep them working with PhysX. (Political battle with EA I'm sure...) I'm sure there are ways to make it work with steam but I guess the launcher for the game isn't that big of a deal. I just launch Origin as a non steam game to keep the overlay.Read this, it might save you a lot of problem solving and head scratchinghttp://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/2uxq1r/problem_installing_meuitm_for_me1/Still need more? Here you gohttp://forum.bioware.com/topic/215916-making-the-most-of-your-me1-pc-experience-maximizing-graphics-and-sound/HERE!Mass Effect is a sci fi RPG set in the future. You travel between galexies trying to save the univers from a massive threat.The choices you make matter. People will live or die because of them, some choices you wont even see the results from until you are playing the second or third game. You truely shape your own story and it's fantastic in every way. The game play mechanics are a bit dated, as are the graphics but the mod listed above should help with the later. While the game play mechanics are dated, they aren't lacking in fun. They aren't tedius, they just aren't stream lined. ME2 has a change in this, and 3 alters game play even further. In this installment you have a inventory and can buy different weapons, armor, ammo types, and get some resonable depth with the leveling system. The next installments simplify this and you lose a lot of that old style mechanic. (I like the armor system and weapon system a lot in the first game but the ways to improve in the second game are good  as well, just different.) You work as a squad, and command each member. That beind said they do have AI and work on their own as well. You can choose to let them use their powers by themselves or, to have complete control of what they use and when they use it by issuing commands. You get to explore planets, there might be random people trying to fight out for their lives, giant creatures waiting to kill you, or little monkeys stealing tech you really want to get your hands on. There is so much I would like to say, but won't at risk of spoiling the adventure for you. Get out there, suit up, and have some fun.If you are going to play any of these games, I highly suggest starting with this one and playing all the way through. If you don't, there are things you will miss. Big things, and little things that make the series shine so bright. I'm commander Lex Lagger, and this is my favorite game on steam. (You'll get the joke once you get to ME2)			",311,29,30,45,19,1,43

												The first Mass Effect game is a game that changed my life. It got me into astronomy and not many games will get me interested into a specific subject and will make me enjoy it. Mass Effect is basically a choose your own adventure book in video game form. The story and characters are very well written and you feel like you're actually this commander that is gathering a small team to take down the Galaxy's biggest threat ever. The music is seriously one of the best ever in video games, it has an 80s synthetic feel to it and you can really feel the emotions in every song. There's just too much replay value in this and I honestly can't recommend this enough. You will not regret playing this series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mass Effect has one of the best sci-fi stories out there and the universe is fascinating. The soundtrack is  absolutly beautiful. I love how the game gives you multiple options when dealing with other characters. Some guy is bothering you? You can politely ask him to go away, or deck him in the face- the choice is up to you. You can easily play this game 2-4 times and have very different experiences. Some cons:-Managing your inventory is way too tedious.-Elevator rides take forever to go anywhere and are completely pointless. Far too often I've gotten into an elevator, waited for the loading screen to being the elevator sequence, gone down the elevator, then waited again once the doors opened to load the map. Why??? It seems like a small thing, but man is it ever annoying (although elevator conversations amongst your sqadamates can be pretty entertaining). ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The only reason to play this is for the story.Many of the reviews on this game lead you to believe is a nearly perfect game. That is probably out of love for most of the franchise and/or nostalgia. graphics are not ""slightly dated"" but extremely dated. combat is extremely clunky until you get to higher levels, and some fights on higher difficulties are damn near impossible. ie, battlemaster krogan. if you cant stun him, after he 1 shots your companions, he will charge you, and no matter how far you run he will wind up right behind you, then punch you and you're dead. There is also the fact that if you die on a boss, you are almost guaranteed to have to go through that entire cutscene again. same with any fight that has a cutscene.The gui is clunky, with stats not being clear, everything being fairly basic design.Planets are barren, with a few spots to visit. The mako is extremely weird to controll. often times you turn much more than you wanted too, it's fairly inaccurate when shooting unless you zoom in, which leaves you with no idea where you're pointing.if you want to play the mass effect series, go ahead and get this game, but don't expect a game with amazing mechanics.  If I knew what this game was like before, I probably would have just watched the story on youtube and saved myself a lot of time then moved on to play the last 2.			",159,24,11,26,25,0,7

												I cannot say enough good things abut the triology. The game was so charcter driven that I came to care about my FemShep and the crew. By the 3rd game there were times I was a wreck because I was so invested. Even the first game was brilliant and Bioware just got better and better with the trilogy. Yeah, ME was made in 2008 and it shows its age but the character development and foundation of the series was there.Even with combat, this game can be slow for those looking for action. A lot of the game is about discovery and making choices, which many of them carry over from game to game. However, I have not found a better RPG/Action game yet.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

For the most part this is an average good quality game, but the impressive story/script is what stands up and makes this game so awesome, too bad many people will miss it because its a videogame, maybe it would have been better as a movie instead.

												So I’m a bit slowpoke.jpg on this game. It was first developed for the Xbox 360 and later ported to the PC and PS3. The game came out in 2007, and seven years later I get down to playing it. First off, the maps were really difficult to read. I often had issues figuring out where the hell I was supposed to go. Then there were the freaking elevators. Elevator Sim 2007. Everywhere you went there were 13 elevators with 13 different awkward elevator conversations. No more elevators pls. There were some glitch’s with the gameplay itself, falling into trenches, not being able to move, getting stuck etc. The biggest issue I had was starting the actual game itself. Be aware that many computers have issues with starting or playing this game up. There are several forums that discuss different methods to fix this problem. Overall what really makes this game amazing is the storyline. Okay I’ll admit the lore went over my head, but it was really an interesting story. You get to choose whether you’re renegade or paragon, meaning are you an asshat or an asskisser? Either way you’re still an♥♥♥♥♥ Stick all your points in charm or intimidate to get more dialogue options. The sound effects were spot on, graphics… what can you say? 2007. But the voice acting was aweesssoooommmmmeeeee. The character designs were really interesting as well. Can’t wait to play the second one. Also who the hell wears pink and white to a battlefield? Oh that’s Ashley. 9/10			",165,106,8,26,37,3,19

												No one likes to display their closet nerd stuff out in public.There are only about 4 types of game related shirts I come across that people seem okay with wearing out into public without getting massive wedgies from everyone. Halo or Call of Duty something (shooter nerds trying to act like they're not nerds chugging all that Mountain Dew) A Horde or Alliance symbol (Warcraft nerds) Anything Nintendo related (Nintendo's cool but Super Smash Brothers on Steam is the future come on Reggie Fils make it happen...) The mysterious N7 symbol (You'll see well groomed, attractive, a-list type folks whom you're sure couldn't possibly be into games strutting around in these)Yes, the N7 symbol that comes from Mass Effect.  People walk around wearing this in real life with beaming pride.  The amount of respect for the symbolic designation of Commander Sheppard's training in interplanetary warfare (The N7 ranking) is huge amongst fans.  The distribution of Commander Sheppard's Jersey (N7) may very well rival the amount of wear and public exposure as some semi-popular professional athelete jerseys.Mass Effect is here to stay...indefinitely.  With this first game a giant amount of gamers became life long fans.  It's amazing to see the sheer diversity of people who have become so attached to the universe and the characters.  People cosplay the characters and go to conventions even though the trilogy for Mass Effect has reached its conclusion long ago.  (No worries, there are definitely more Mass Effect games to come).Along with Dragon Age, Baldur's Gate and Knights of the Old Republic, this would be another example of Bioware's dedication to crafting intense stories and deep characters that people can really dive deep into.The GameMass Effect is a Space RPG focused on story and character development.  The conversation wheel is used frequently to allow the character to engage in discussions with other NPCs and teammates they encounter during gameplay.In this game you play as the commander of an elite team consisting of the galaxy's most skilled interstellar fighters in a mission to save the galaxy.  It's essentially a third person, cover shooter where you can issue commands to your teammates to strategically position them and to use special abilities on enemies.You can fight with what is essentially Star Wars-esque Force PowersAlong with all manner of space guns: Rifles, Sniper Rifles, Pistols, Shotguns, automatics and so on.Pros Great Gameplay mechanics Excellent Story Excellent Character Design (People are obsessed with their favorite characters) Excellent Visuals Very elaborate RPG elements Choices made can impact the of outcome events both immediately and in later games (This is the first part of a trilogy)Cons Inventory can get a little cluttered There's a rare chance that you can encounter a catastrophic bug in a few places that will prevent you from progressing (must reload your last save) Save Often The entire trilogy isn't available on Steam....blame Electronic Arts.If you enjoy Sci Fi and RPGs, this game is a no brainer.  You've probably played it already.  If you haven't...now's the time...			",80,16,0,18,0,0,9

												This game involved everything I could wish for in a game. While keeping an awesome, full of events story, the game also offers many different side missions which are not far behind the main campaign.In addition, the dialogue in this game is very friendly and allows you to easily distinguish between good and bad, which makes role playing much more convenient. Apart from the great fun which I had playing this game, I also felt strong emotions and got attached to my character.10/10 - A game any gamer should play. Can't wait to play the second.

												Just a quick review.People will tell you that Mass Effect 2 is where the serries really got good. People will tell you to skip 1 and go straight to 2. People will say ""I could never really get over the graphics"" or ""I just don't like the controls.""Those people are wrong.There has never been a game quite like this one and there may never be again. The storytelling, the characters, the humor, the love, and passion, and fear you will feel are like nothing you've experienced before. It's a roller-coaster of emotions and, like the best roller-coasters, it will leave you awed, overjoyed, and a little out of breath.In conclusion: yes, the graphics are weak by today's standards. Yes, the controls are clunky. Yes, the Mako handles like a jetski in a desert. Yes, you shoulc 100%, absolutly get this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mass Effect is a sexual rollercoaster. One minute, your♥♥♥♥♥♥is starting to tremble from the adrenaline that you feel as you're slaughtering dozens of unarmed colonists, the next you're getting rammed by a Krogan warlord. And nothing quite prepares you for the initial feeling of going balls deep in an Asari scientist, as you pull on her ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little tentacles. And lemme tell ya, this octopus doesn't trim her garden (Geddit?! Pubic hair comments with Beatles references!) However, the most powerful experience this game gives the player is the possibility to take advantage of an Easter egg in which you can anally probe a Geth, which shows how hard the developers worked to hold true to their sci-fi roots. Remember when that movie ""AI. Artificial Intelligence"" with Jude Law came out back in 2001, and everyone wanted to bang the brains out of Haley Joel Osment's character? It's kinda like that, but without the pedo vibe. All in all, I give Mass Effect 11 ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tentacles out of 5. Meaning it was ""meh.""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Excelent and very involving. The game offers you a rich scenario, with plenty of things to do. The game mechanics are a bit unconfortable, but it gets fun once you get used to it. Soundtrack is beautiful and well suited, the plot is very well designed, involving and fun to uncover. The graphics are old, but they are good enough. Characteres are the main strength of the game I think: very complex personalities, many possible interactions and dialogue outcomes. You will never few like you are talking to the same NPC, regardeless if he is a shopper, guard, squad member or quest-NPC. They are so well design you can few pity or foundness for some of them.The game have weaknesses , I can say that for one thing, money is useless. Yes, you can buy some interesting upgrades and weapons/armors with it. But it is definitely not a must, you can go just fine with the loots you find in mission. The few upgrades you can't find in mission (like extra medi-gel capacity for instance) are so cheap it doesen't really few you are spending anything. Speaking of upgrades, those are another weak spot of the game. Too many of those and they don't look so different. When you less expect you will be carrying too many of those and not knowing good combinations. I also expected some spaceship warefare...but the game has none. The character role I picked has also some kind of a problem. As an infiltrator, the best combat strategy I have has to sniper-shoot everyone...and cry if an enemy get to close, since I don't have any other effective trained weapon to use. One would expect some sort of clock ability - they fixed that in ME 2, fortunately.But those are minor weaknesses. I would score the game 4 out of 5.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: March 29, 2014
												This game is very near to perfect. If you like RPG, this will quite literally give you a galaxy's worth of role playing. I'll start with the things that don't matter hugely to an RPG, but add to it and bring it to perfection. Firstly, the graphics are beautiful. Individually, tree leaves may look a little pixelated, and close-up shots of weaponry and armour suffer the same effect. However, when the graphics are bought together as a whole the effect is simply profound. Vast cityscapes sprawl beneath the viewing deck on the Citadel's wards, amazing scenery from the Presidium. All the skyboxes are filled with amazing imagery; binary star systems, meteorite showers, even simply beautiful blue skies and white clouds. Tying it all together are the little graphic effects, such as the lifelike water, or whisps of smoke and steam. Detailing on the characters, aliens, and animals are all done excelently, making the alien species not only believable, but also emotionally telling even when blue or scaley. Add to this very effective use of lighting and colours, and the option to have a 'film grain' graphics setting, and you are left with a game that is just beautiful.Next, the music and sounds on this game are very well suited to the gameplay. As with most RPGs, the music seems to crescendo with each new adventure or battle, however at points in this game it also brings in much more somber and melancholly sounding music to reflect the emotions of the charecters and crew aboard the Normandy. In either case, the music always seems to reflect the fact that this is a game anbout space, and definitely adds to the other-worldly feel. The sound effects in the game are not necessarilly subtle, however when playing they become absorbed into the gameplay, something which personally I applaud. All to often I find myself turning down the sound effect volume on a game for it being to loud, or doing the complete opposite as it's too quiet to hear an enemy right behind you. With Mass Effect, all of the sounds effects are well designed so that they fit perfectly into context, and are never out of place. The voice acting in this game is spot on, all the characters are capable of so much emotion, and make the game so much more believable than counterparts with lesser vocals. Even alien races have voices to match, and a variety within the races at that, rather than the same voice actor for every member of a species (Skyrim, guards, what?). Gameplay moves fluidly, whith characters interacting very well with the environment. I don't think I ever found a character floating in mid air, or stuck inside a boulder or staircase, or limbs from a character on one side of a door potruding through to the other side. Charecters take cover when commanded, are able to peer and shoot around objects, and team commands work excelently when directed, and still work well when on automatic. Customisation of you and your team's loadout was most definitely confusing at first, however once grasped really gave the combat situations an extra tactical element, allowing choices between weapons and ammunition types for each new enemy encountered. Added to the game is a hacking minigame which allows you to unlock doors, crates and safes, and this increases with difficulty as it increases with reward, however it would have been nice for the developers to add other methods of hacking - I doubt all locks in the galaxy use the exact same system. Effectively the game has 3 levels of gameplay, the most important being on foot, secondly missions involving driving the mako, and lastly small elements from being in orbit. When in orbit you are free to walk around and interact with your spaceship, and have access to the galaxy map. From this map you can explore the galaxy through nebulas, star systems and down to an individual planetary level. This allows you to scan planets for resources, and choose to land on some of the planets to perform a mission. When on minor missions on other planets, usually you will be assigned to drive the mako, an armoured six wheeled heavy hitting tank of sorts. Equiped with some form of machine gun, a slower firing cannon, and the ability to fly for a very brief period of time, it is fun to use. The controls are a bit strange at first, with the turning not behaving quite as you'd expect, however once you've gotten used to it, the driving becomes a lot more fun.Finally, the part most people want from an RPG to be perfect is the story, the character interactions, quite simply, the role playing. This game SATISFIES. In playing this game you can either simply blast through the main missions and skip the dialogue, missing out the majority of the context and background, or you can take the time to talk to minor characters, pick up side missions, and simply use dialogue options to ask questions. All of these actions add a hugely deep and mixed background for the in-game galaxy, with complex interactions and repercussions of past actions echoed in the game you get to play, although possibly misunderstood or simply missed if the player choses to ignore them. If the interactions themselves didn't satisfy, the game has a 'codex', which is basically an encyclopedia which fills as you play and interact, meaning that if at any point you forget something you've picked up or simply want to learn more about an aspect of the game (with a large scope, from biology and cuture of alien races, to the weapons and armour used on the Normandy) you can delve into the codex and gain a better understanding. The storyline is believable, and multiple storylines can be followed through the use of paragon (hero) or renegade (badass) options. This allows for much greater depth and character development, and continues with your choices in the first game bridging over into the sequels. The paragon/renegade choice also shapes the way you interact with individual characters, bringing different methods of conflict resolution, persuading your way through tough situations, or even romance with the choice being left to the player. Character interactions are usually emotionally charged without being unreal, and these emotions build as you become closer to your crew, leading to some very hard decisions in the late game. Overall, this is one of my most favourite games I've ever played since I started on a Windows 95 at the age of 2. I fell in love on my first playthrough, and it definitely brings an amazing sense of gravitas with it. The game is deep, moving, and most importantly believable. Grapics, audio, and gameplay elements tie the whole package together in a beautiful way, and pull the player in deeper. I'd easilly give this a 9/10, and would recomend this to anyone with even a slight love of RPG. Simply put, buy this game, play it, and cherish it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Belated review. If you are a sucker for any of the following: spaceships, aliens, storytelling, RPGs, shooters, or sci-fi in general, and haven't yet played Mass Effect... well, what are you waiting for?!? Even though it's a few years old now and has a few minor problems, Mass Effect is still well-worth playing, especially if you have any interest at all in the upcoming ME3. I thought overall it was a really fun game, especially the story aspects. The shooting mechanics are also perfectly fine. The only major gripe I had was the weapon/inventory system. Throughout your journey, you are constantly finding tons of weapons and upgrades, 99% of which are duplicates or unneccessary. The interface for managing weapons is also confusing and cumbersome. But that one thing aside, I pretty much loved everything else about ME1. If you haven't played it yet, get it now!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Yes, the controls are clunky. Yes, the Mako handles like a jetski in a desert. Yes, you shoulc 100%, absolutly get this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is my first review so please don't hate!Mass Effect 1 is the first of the ME trilogy, one of the best RPG trilogies of today.Despite lacking the better graphics of the later 2 games, the story is still extreemly well made, the characters are just amazing to play, talk and experiment with, lots of quest and places to explore (for those who love completing the games as much as possible and have the patience to do it)Unfortunately it still has some bugs in it, but most people have found ways around them if you look around for fixes, at least i managed to fix 2-3 more known bugs such as the sound crackle, starmap bug and quicksave bug.It is one of my favorite games of all time, Bioware has the most talented dev's from my point of view so bear with the graphics and play your way trough this trilogy, its well worth every single penny.

												BioWare are masters at world building, and in this case universe building. Mass Effect is a massive sci-fi experience, letting the player explore an entire galaxy while offering superb characters and storytelling. It's true that the action is somewhat simplistic, and experienced players will rarely be threatened, but the whole thing is so stunningly beautiful and epic that you won't care. Honestly, I really thought there was no chance that Bioshock would be challenged for game of 2007, but Mass Effect equals it for sheer cinematic awesomeness. Compulsory gaming!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mass Effect is a must have.Simply because it kicked off the most sophisticated Sci-Fi IP of the past 30 years. The richness and depth of the Mass Effect Series' universe is easily on par with Star Wars and Star Trek. If you are a Sci-Fi Fan you can not help but get sucked in and swallowed whole by this beast.As a game the strength of Mass Effect besides it's lore is a superb story within that lore, believable Charaters to interact with, choices over choices that impact not only the current game but reach forward into part 3 and some of the best written and performed dialog of all time.Within the series this is the game featuring the most Exploration opportunities and the strongest classical RPG elements (VERY stat and skill dependant down to a limit in inventory space, lots of loot).The weak points:Bugs. It's a problem with the whole series. There is nothing gamebreaking, but some Bugs are just plain out annoying and stupid but never got fixed. My guess is that this is in no small part due to the fact that the Mass Effect games are made for consoles first and foremost and are from a console era when patching wasn't really an option.While the Exploration possibilities are quite big it sadly isn't done very well. Most of it consists of driving a vehicle with crazy physics through randomly generated height maps that had a few prefabs placed in them. That is litterally something that a hobbyist just learning how to make maps can put together in an hours work or less.The list of weak points could be made longer.But in reality they do not matter. Because the story and how it is presented not only makes up for the weak points. It lets you forget them. I am just in the middle of another series playthrough just because I have finally gotten all DLCs for part 3. And this probably is the strongest pro going for the series: Even though you could play just part 3. When you pick it up again you wanna start at the beginning again. With Part 1. Because seeing a new Shepard evolve and change over the course of three games is just awesome. It is just like those Lord of the Ring or Star Wars weekends when you watch all the movies in succession. Only better because it lasts for weeks. Hell a 100% completion playthrough of all three games is worth easily 150 hours of playtime.Last but not Least: Another important reason to get the Mass Effect Series is that part 4 is rumored to hit us next year at the latest and you absolutely will want to know what all the fuss is about when that happens.

Posted: April 3
												I had been pushing this game aside for years till Mass Effect 2 came along and I wanted to play this game to see what all the fuss was about. I am mainly a FPS gamer, I have steered clear of most RPG games since I knew that they were addictive and took a huge chunk of time to finish. What I didn’t realize back then was the man-hours and creativity that goes into making these games. So Mass Effect was my introduction to the world of RPGs. This was also the first BioWare game I’ve ever played and I’m glad I took the plunge. I played the Mass Effect Trilogy on my PS3 so this review is based on the PS3 version though I'm planning to play this trilogy again on PC now. Before that I wanted to write my first ever review for a game on Steam. I hope you'll like it.Who’ll love this game:Do you like feeling all powerful?Do you like to feel that your every decision will have overreaching and cascading effects through time and on other lives?Do you like to be a galactic hero who has a reputation for saving millions of lives?Do you like to fight an alien race that’s so old and powerful that they don’t even consider you worthy of attention like an insect?If the answer to any of these questions is yes, then you’ve picked the right game.The Story:The story is set in a Universe where we have a galactic government and humanity is among the newest species to be inducted into it. Spectres are among the elite who possess great power vested onto them by the government. They can take decisions independently and they even have a license to kill without fear of any repercussions. So as it happens one of these Spectres, Saren has just gone rogue and he is travelling the universe collecting Prothean artefacts which are extremely advanced for their time and these artifacts actually pave the way for the developed, modern technological era. Protheans are an ancient species that have long gone extinct centuries before our story even starts.The scope of this story is wide reaching and feels daunting at first and makes you realize how high the stakes are. The way the story twists and turns and reaches its shocking ending is brilliant. There’s always something interesting to do and your choices change the course of the story. As the game progresses you have to make harder choices with major consequences. Every decision feels personal and when you mess up it’s heartbreaking. That’s how strongly this story sucks you in.The Dialogue:The dialogues in this game are a little rigid and robotic. I think this is the only minor gripe I have in what is otherwise an excellent game. The conversations don’t sound natural. Probably this is the writer’s idea of how a space faring species speaks.The Characters:Captain Shepherd is the first human Spectre. You can either choose to play as the Male Shepherd or Fem Shepherd. You can even choose his backstory. He/She has a tragic backstroy but is a bonafide badass with a reputation that precedes him. Over the course of the game you meet your team members: Garrus Vakarian, Kaidan Alenko, Ashley Williams, Tali'Zorah nar Rayya, Liara T'Soni and Urdnot Wrex. They join your team for various reasons and each of them has a compelling reason to join your team. These are well rounded and memorable character. It’s fun to converse with them and get to know more about them between missions and you can also romance (have sex with) some of these team members. Incase you were wondering I did Liara T’Soni and Ashley on my two play-through sessions. I played a Fem Shepherd on both and Liara is a darling.Villains are aplenty in this game and there’s a lot of variety to the kind of villains that we get to face during the course of this game. Geth, Husks, Asari, Humans, Turians and Colossus Geth etc. Each one of these requires a different strategy to tackle if you want to get past them with minimal damage. After the final reveal we face an enemy that’s just phenomenal in scale.Weapons Inventory System:As a FPS gamer I am quite accustomed to “loadouts” but inventory management is something I seldom come across in FPS games and this was a steep learning curve for me as a starter on RPG. This game has a very deep inventory system where you get to choose which one of the weapons or abilities of the team members you’d like to improve. I think this was the most tedious part of the gameplay (besides Mako which I’ll get into later). I’d just say that I would prefer to spend much less time on inventory management and more time in actually playing the game. So sometimes it can be frustrating (they fixed it in Mass Effect 2). However, it should be remembered that this is a very important feature that helps in tackling stronger enemies as the game progresses.Vehicle Controls:Oh! Why? Why do I have to drive the Mako through so many terrains? Mako is a multi-terrain vehicle which is mostly helpful during some assignments on uncharted planets. Some of the levels with Mako are definitely worth playing over and over again however, my problem is with Mako itself. If you have played this game already you’d know that the controls for this thing are probably the biggest problem this game has. It seems like Mako has a mind of its own sometimes. Except for the Mako most of the controls are pretty solid in this game. Missions:You get to go on a boatload of assignments in this game. Apart from the story based missions you also get the secondary missions which may sometimes feel repetitive. However, playing these missions help in exploring some vital elements which are required to help you level up faster. In that way these are a necessary evil. I’d recommend playing all of these secondary missions.Soundtrack:Jack Wall delivers one of the most thoughtful soundtracks for a game. The soundtrack amplifies several scenes in this game and it feels like an integral part of these scenes. It sets the mood and atmsphere with the extensive synth use which feels futuristic even if it should like it belonged in the 80s. This is a great game and a game of this caliber deserved a great soundtrack and that’s just what it is. Conclusion:Mass Effect boasts of a great story that’s built around great characters and (for the most part) great gameplay. But by no means is this game easily conquered. You may have to spend atleast 40-50 hours in order to finish this game and that makes me think how hard it must have been for the game designers to create such an expansive world. The voice acting and visuals in this game deserve high praise and they actually account for the strongest visceral impact of this game. I’ve played this game twice in both Paragon and Renegade playstyles, so that’s about over 100 hours of game time and it was totally worth it. Even today there are few games out there that are this immersive. Every time I play this game, I feel like I’m really Captain Shepherd and that’s a testament to how strongly you get attached to this world and the characters. One thing is for certain, once you enter this world you'll never forget it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let me say this. I loved the game, it's a wonderful story and action is top notch. From your own custom Shepeard to the crew you take on missions this game has tons to offer.Pros:1. You can date people through out the game2. A large number of weapons and ammor that are not just stat ups, they look difrent.3. Story telling to the max4. Unique races and rich story for all of them5. No one is perfect. Everyone has some intresting abilites making you have to pick the right people for the job.Cons:1. Considering what you pick as your job at the start one of your crew is kinda usless.2. Lot of the time is spent looking around one aera for the last sidequest3. A few glitches can ruin the game4. There isn't much interaction between crew when on missions besides the basic lines you will normally hear.5. NO GAY ALIEN!!!  This is kinda my pet peve for all three games. Female Shep you get the choice of three aliens ( 2 males and 1 female) If you pick male Shep the only gay romances are humans.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really enjoyed this gamePros--The story is well crafted and you can tell alot of effort was put into it. It has lots of twists, turns, and reveals that are pretty good. Not mind blowing, but still, its one of the highlights of the game. Theres alot there if you want to dig giving players a choice in how far they want to go into the lore of the worle. -Interactions with your squad members are memorable and personal. Each has distinct personalities and underlying motives that are there if you spend the time to get to know them all-The branching diolauge paths are great. Give some depth and a player's touch into the game. Not super deep and many diolauges still lead to the exact same result but thats ok.-The settings were pretty good. It was really neat to go explore all these planets and choose in what order you were to do it in. The aliens and universe created here are also interesting and thought out.-Runs well on my crap PC and also has a widespread texture mod for those who seek higher fidelity. Cons-Elevators. There are alot of them. Most I assume are disgusing loading screens and it really gets old fast especially when in some situations you go through one elevator, get out, walk a bit, then go up another. -Combat. While it is good I wouldnt call it great. I played on the hardest difficulty with AI actions turned off for my squad mates and one of two things would happen in combat situations: my main character could just wipe out all the enemies without the help of my squadmates so I have no reason to even have them do anything, or when I do need them they are HORRIBLE at staying alive. Even when you direct them towards cover they very often come out for no reason and die. Somtimes you plan a combo of abilities on a enemy all at once but one squad member decides that its just not happening today. It got annoying. Also I didnt like that you had to pick your squadmates from the begining of the mission when you have no idea whats in store. They all have different abilities but only a few combos cover everything so it locks you out of doing certain combos of characters you may like. Overall it is an ok combat system, that with some tweaks could be really really good.-Driving sections - controls are kind of slippery and every driving section all game has the same 3 or 4 enemies making them really easy and really boring-Enemies. There are only about 10 enemys in the whole game if you dont count reskins. Kind of a a let down. -Final Boss- Ended up just being the main bad guy with the abilities of one of the enemy types you have fought all game with a stupid amount of health and rocket launchers added on. I get that the combat doesnt really lend itself to grandiose boss battles but still. Boss battles in general were usually just waves of common enemies. -Save points, This is the grandaddy of my annoyances with this game. Probably 5-10 times thoughout the main game you will have boss battles or very difficult encounters that have loooong cutscenes or elevators right before them. These cannot be skipped and its awful. Every time you die you have to walk through the same diolauge for 2 minutes before you fight. It gets old really fast espeicailly if you are having a real tough time with the boss. I get not skipping on the first time but there is no reason you shouldnt be able to skip on subsequent viewings.Overall I did really enjoy this game. This is a game that is greater than the sum of its parts. It keep me wanting to play to figure out what would happen next which cant be said for too many games I play. If you like a good space story and third person tactical shooters, I would grab this game. 7.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Rank: 8.5/10Recommendation(s): Player is a Sci-Fi lover, enjoys RPG games, and is willing to continue gameplay series by porting results in to the later games. If using 3D Vision, use Helix Mod.Major Theme: How to define ""original"" Bioware games.Bought at Price: $35 (for Mass Effect 1 and Mass Effect 2 Deluxe)Only a few games fit into the ""must play"" listing I keep. If you have any dreams or hopes in playing the other Mass Effect games, start here. You will thank me later!Bioware is the company to know for RPG titles. The lead writer (and then co-lead writer for Mass Effect 2) ensures you have a story filled with action and content. If you ever played Knights of the Old Republic (KotOR) I or II you will feel right at home. While feeling like KotOR in some ways, Mass Effect is a more ""mature"" version of it. You should be willing to deal with (and enjoy) the extra sex, gore, and innuendo that this title brings. Stories really need to have sex, gore, and humour to make them balanced, and that's what Mass Effect's plot brings.Using the Unreal Engine from 2007, graphics are decent and shouldn't have issues running on most systems. If you have a control panel for your graphics card, you can try to force better options. That being said, there's a hidden frame rate smoothing option (60 fps), when disabled, can allow any high refresh rate monitor to shine. This can also help 3D vision players.Game is rated 3D vision ""excellent"", only real issue being that enemy icons seem 2D. This can be resolved, and overall stereoscopic 3D performance increased, by using Helix Mod. Really, Helix makes Mass Effect a treat to play with and will greatly improve immersion.It should be assumed that you do not stop with Mass Effect. There's 2 more games to explore and enjoy in the series (besides the comics, books and such). This really just sets up the plot for the rest of the series. The biggest thing that the series should be known for is it's save porting, where you are able to plug the results of a previous title into the next and change the plot.The ""romance mechanic"" is simple, as noted in my Mass Effect 2 review. This has lead to the Mass Effect romance system being called a ""getting laid simulator"". Don't be expecting to see the same mechanic from Dragon Age: Origins here. You can see my review on that title as well, if you wish for a better explanation.Reading other bonus content, the biggest thing you will feel in the game is that there's still hidden old school RPG mechanics in play. While you think you are shooting a target, your shots can in fact miss. Another will be the inventory system, where you can only hold so many items. If you do not manage your inventory, you will be forced to either ditch items, or modify the hidden limit value. Just be aware this title hasn't fully transitioned out of those older mechanics.While not in the special elite class of 90+ on the metascore, still worthwhile. I'm sick of seeing COD like games, reskined platform runners, and super simple games. I've played enough out of my Valve titles, so this game was a breath of fresh air and worked out well.

												Rating 8/10OverviewThird Person Shooter Role Playing Game  - Impressive game with serious flawsThe Good:+ The game provides a variety of different classes that suit individual play styles. Each class comes with its own unique set of advantages and disadvantages. Certain classes can only use certain types of weapons and abilities.  The game also gives you the option of solving missions by being good(paragon) or a bit more ruthless (renegade) Depending on your choice, leads to more dialogue options in the future. +Combat is a huge part of the game. Each gun type feels good, along with the different abilities. You can issue commands to your party members however for the most part they do fine if you leave them be.  Certain battles can be very engaging requiring you to make full use of the environments and equipment. +The overall plot is excellent and keeps the game interesting. Although it touches upon a lot of different sci fi tropes the game presents all of these ideas in a manner that makes the game interesting and fun to play+ The writing/dialogue and the voice acting are all fantastic making every interaction engaging to listen to.+In typical Bioware fashion, the companions and villains are interesting and for the most part, the best characters in the game. Talking to each companion and listening to their history adds a level of depth to the game. +Character design is excellent, each race has a unique look and feel to them adding to the believability. + The main missions are varied and fun to play, each mission involves driving a vehicle which helps break up the shooting segments and keeps things from getting stale. +The lead up to the final confrontation and ultimately the conclusion is epic. It really feels satisfying, and is a fitting end to the game. I would argue this game has a better build up to the end than the other games in the series. +The overall scope of this game is impressive for what its trying to accomplish. The game has a variety of different planets to explore in your vehicle, side missions, story missions, talking to your companions, learning the history of the different races, planets, technologies etc. If you are a gamer who loves being absorbed into a universe Bioware did a fantastic job of detailing every possible aspect of the game. +Graphically the game still holds up very well, though textures seem blurry. + Music and soundThe Bad:- The user interface is abysmal for what this game is trying to accomplish. Buying/Selling or even equipping items in your inventory seems much harder than it needs to be. The UI does not convey information in a presentable fashion. There are options missing that would makes things so much easier, i.e organizing  inventory lists based on damage/accuracy etc.-Side missions are incredibly repetitive for all the wrong reasons. The game recycles three or 4 level designs over and over again taking the fun out of playing these missions. In addition most side quest missions are completed the same way- Kill lots of enemies, reach the end of the level, talk to somebody and resolve it by being good or bad. If you played one of them, you pretty much played them all. -The idea of exploring different planets, discovering lost ruins, and missions certainly sounds awesome but something was lost in the execution. Going down to a planet is amazing the first time but quickly wears off its appeal the third, fourth or fifth time. Every planet although very different in look and feel, plays out all the same. Driving around in barren landscapes is only fun for so long. This is the only way to get and complete side quests. -Bugs, glitches are present. I got stuck in a wall more than a few occasions. -No official controller support. I know mods exists to correct this issue but it is not fully implemented. You can't properly use the controller in menus nor can you use it when issuing commands to your party members. ConclusionThere is plenty to love with this game and I certainly loved my time with it, however the glaring flaws holds it back from what should be a true classic.  ",731,344,32,73,63,8,96

The plot is awesome and the music is very nice.For a game that came out around 2007, ME1 has awesome graphics and spectacular environments.There is also a feature that you can explore a big variety of planets and you can see unbelievable views while exploring, from frozen snowy mountains, to red sanded deserts with volcanoes.Surelly a perfect game and the 1st title of the briliant Mass Effect Trilogy.

												Mass Effect. The beginning of a series of video games which led me to where I am in my gaming experiences today. The trilogy is great, but the first game is where it's at. You meet all the characters, get your feet wet with all the action, and the Shepard. Commander Shepard. I reccommend this game to everyone I meet and will talk about it all the time!Sure, the game may be a little buggy sometimes, but comon! Learn to embrace bugs or glitches as part of the finished product and simply enjoy the game. I sure did, and I loved every second of it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An excellant sci-fi adventure! A truly great RPG and a must play for fans of RPG's and Sci-fi. A robust and well told story with a cast of interesting characters with a variety of interesting choices. However I should note as of now its a somewhat dated game and the combat is kinda poor. A few nitpicks are some unskippable cutscenes, not allowing quicksave duiring combat and a few odd design choices. Also if you end up trying to change the controls the game becomes incredibley buggy forcing you to use defualts. Overall solid game 8/10			",71,9,0,13,6,0,6

												This is a great game with a lot of effort gone into creating the universe in which it takes place. The gameplay is fine, pretty standard cover shooting but with the ability to use squad powers as well as your own. Overall I felt the story was pretty compelling and my second time through I had the patience and the interest to read through most of the codex and dialogue options. Missions become a little repetitive and the side quests are pretty much clones of each other even going as far as whole buildings having the same layout even if they were built lightyears apart. Overall though I was always having fun except when trying to manage the poor inventory system. If you're into your sci-fi and your shooters, this is a must.			",904,197,17,59,57,3,87

												Mass Effect 1, I haven't heard of this game until my sister told me about a great story game! I have played this game 5 or more times with a pirated version and bought and played this game on steam for 3 more times! Anyway, a truely multi story-driven futuristic kind of game! I love it! Not to mention your saved game can be imported to the next game Mass Effect 2!My recommendation: Play FEMALE SHEPARD!!!!!

												Soldiering through the repetitive, tiresome combat of the first 17 hours made the balls-tighteningly awesome finale all the more insanely epic. My struggle to be a competent player mirrored Shep's struggle to be a competent leader. We fought long and hard to make it to the climax, and oh boy was it a climax. One of the best stories in all of gaming, surpassed by its successor in usability, but not in mental anguish.			",222,46,7,10,12,2,7

												What can be said about Mass Effect that hasn't already been said?Mechanically, it's a third-person shooter/RPG hybrid with interactive, choice-driven cinematics interspersed regularly.There are certainly problems with that. The conversations and cinematics wind up taking up, quite literally, most of your time--except of course the endless backtracking on the Normandy and Mako portions--and making the game feel more like a visual novel than a Western action-RPG at times. It feels more like a story and less like a game, some of the time. Most of the time, really.The RPG leveling is good, but nowhere near as good as, say, Skyrim's, or the original Deus Ex's. (I say the original because I have yet to play Human Revolution, not because I object to it in any way.) The levels you wind up focusing on are Charm and Intimidate, whose primary impact involves, you guessed it, the cinematic conversations. There's the electronics and decryption skill trees, sure (although they're more just lines than trees--for a game centered around choice-based narrative, there's not much choice-based gameplay) which allow you to access increasingly more advanced resources, but if you just bring one of your three tech-savvy squadmates and fully spec them to those trees, you can deal with any of those unlicks from about three hours in, which kind of renders the piont moot. That's good, though, because the alternative is yet more Mako scenes as you backtrack to planets you've already seen once you can access the resources on them.The shooter portion, which is the part you actually play, has fewer concrete issues. You point and shoot. It's just lackluster. The sniper rifles are unsteady in a rather blatant nod to Deus Ex--they get better as you level them. Pistols are pretty much slightly slower assault rifles. Shotguns are bizzarely effective over long ranges. Assault Rifles, which only Soldier-class characters can train, are actually quite viable for non-soldier characters, to the point where on higher difficulties the game is almost impossible if you  forget about them.The biggest issues I have are with certain enemies and level design. The Geth units which jump around the area are almost impossible to hit, especially if you haven't got a controller mod installed. There is the occasional open level where sniper rifles are viable, but a lot of the game is played at close-quarters to the enemy, which renders snipers useless. Annoying, since I like the Infiltrator class's tech abilities combines with combat proficiency, since biotics are very hard to use in this first game.But in spite of all that, Mass Effect works, mechanically speaking. Nothing is broken. I wouldn't come back to it for the gameplay, but it's not painful to play--unless you're in the Mako and trying to 100% every planet, in which case, you have my sympathies.Where Mass Effect--and Bioware in general--shine is in narrative. Mass Effect--the first game, not the trilogy--does a fantastic job of creating a setting and telling a story in it. It's a bit bland compared to its two sequels, I'll be honest. It doesn't have the thematic subtext those games do. Mass Effect 1 is nothing more than it claims to be: a story which provides you a template--Shepard--and lets you play with him or her how you choose. But that much it does incredibly well.There are few scenes in a video game that have aged as well as the first meeting with Sovereign on Virmire or the conversation with Vigil on Ilos. Despite the ridiculous texture glitch on Garrus' face, we start to get a real feel for one of the best characters in gaming in this game, and he is fun, especially when in an elevator with Tali or Wrex so they can yell at each other.The less said about elevators, the better, of course.The romances are a bit dull, I will admit. Your choices are Kaidan, Ashley, and Liara. Kaidan is bland, Ashley is xenophobic, and Liara never uses contractions because at this point Bioware still thought that was a cool way to make a character mysterious. I guess Liara's the best choice, but it's a bit like deciding which cheap shoe looks least cheap.Wow, I'm really bashing the game aren't I? Yeah, it's flawed. Really flawed. But it works. The first playthrough can be incredibly immersive. Saren is a great villain, most of the time, and a good one overall. Sovereign is truly chilling. You feel like something is at stake, by the end of the game, although it never quite reaches the emotional peaks at the last levels of Mass Effect 2 and 3.All in all, it's not a masterpiece, but it's a fun game, and one well worth a purchase, even when it's not on sale. When it is on sale, you'd be a fool not to get it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is the first of three games, albeit the third one isn't on Steam. It executed the plot very well, had interesting characters, and unique gameplay for both decision-making and combat. There are issues with the game, however. There's a common glitch that renders your controls useless at random (rare) times, making you have to relaunch the game. Still, I would rate this game a 7/10.Would I recommend playing it? Yes!

												The intentions of Mass Effect as the beginning of a series are apparent in damn near every aspect of the experience.  In a word: foundation.  It feels like it was designed to be built up upon, because what is here is aesthetically light, but structurally phenomenal.What's immediately striking about Mass Effect given it's nature as an RPG is how well it plays as an action game.  Combat feels polished and dynamic, featuring an automatic cover system that works in tandem with largely artifical environments designed around boxes/wall/etc that leave no doubt as to what can and cannot be used for cover.   The shooting mechanics feel impactful and effective and the overall design accomodates both tactical and run-gun-hav'n-fun forms of play.  Battles can be as dynamic or degenerate strategy as you want them to be and not feel like either is more viable than the other.But as an RPG, it's remarkable how many aspects of the game have been given this effectively tactile sense of physicality.  The ability to select responses through a conversation wheel with a mouse click creates a remarkably natural sense of rhythm to talking with NPCs that closely emulate real life.  There's no artificial time limit to responses either, this all happens as a natural consequence of the design of the system.  The physicality runs even to the more minor tasks such as hacking and navigation, extending the life of what would normally be sloggishly repetative tasks.  Again, as an RPG, it's rather startling just how good this game FEELS to play.So what's not to love?  Well...yeah, we'll get to that, but first things first:You are Commander Shepard, a human who's being eyed at by the Leaders of the Free Galaxy for the prestigious title of Spectre: an Intergalatic Man/Woman of Mystery with a License to Kill.  Things go♥♥♥♥♥♥up due a Spectre Whose Gone Rogue that leaves you with Information Vital to Saving the Galaxy and you are eventually tasked with Taking Him Down only to find that Behind His Power is A Much Greater Power that Threatens to Destroy the Galaxy!  If that all sounds cliche and routine well, that's cause it is.  Again, it feels like a foundation.  It's in the details - the subtleties and nuances they paint upon that very broad canvas - that makes the game's world so rewarding to experience.  The sheer amount of content they put into world building is astounding, but the restraint in not overloading the player with it if they don't want while still having it inform the situations the game creates is certainly worthy of note.The thing to note upon a first run is how deceptively large the game is.  Playing the main quest takes you to only five planets before the endgame.  Some feature hub sections with a few sidequests, but taken as a whole, you could easily breeze through the entire game in only a few hours.  The bulk of the game's content is side quests that have you running willy nilly through dozens of systems in various clusters throughout the galaxy, usually touching upon some various world building content or minor character moments.  They can vary from a simple one-click scan of a planet for resources, to full on multi-planet hopping quests featuring both surface exploration, combat and tense negotiations...and there's SCORES of them!So now...the price that's payed for all this polish and content: The game doesn't look very good.Oh it's technically proficient.  Textures, faces and all are quite up to snuff.  But the design of the game is bare bones.  Any environment not devoted to the main quest is entirely pre-fab and not even randomly generated.  There's only some half dozen variations on them and since they do not change, it get's immediately repetative.  Even the main quest planets feel overly artificial and lifeless.  Mulitple quests end abruplty with nothing more than a pop-up window delivering silent flavor text and while the planet exploration goes a long way towards delivering on the scale the game, the actual landscapes were clearly randomly generated hieghtmaps ripped straight out of a late '90's 3d software program.  And yes, the way the game handles inventory is one of the worst I've seen anywhere ever.  Ya happy?So that's Mass Effect.  A game where all the polish was put into the systems and design rather than the aesthetics, leading to a massive new world for players to explore that felt large, felt good to roleplay and simply play in...all so long as you ignored it'd been filled with blatantly copy/pasted environments.  Playing the game, the intent is very clear that this was to be the building blocks for a more fully realized world to build around their solid mechancis, design and world building.  Ah well...

												The Mass Effect trilogy is with out a doubt my favourite, as few games have captivated me in such a scale as these ones. This particular game is the first in the trilogy(obviously) and in many ways what got me into the rpg-genre of gaming. I wasn't a fan of this genre beforehand and for me to get my hands on this game was actually a happy mistake. I got to randomly try out the demo and have never looked back since. The greatest strengts of this game is its grand, epic and interesting story, both ingame and lorewise. Bioware(developer) is also known to craft some of the finest characters/companions around, which makes the whole experience that more awesome. You care about them and want to get to know them better for their great diversity, flaws or stengths. Some of the gameplay may be a bit rusty (It came out in 2007) but if you're in for the story and lore you will not get dissapointed. The sequels will greatly expand on the gameplay, as will your choices. Remember, the Mass Effect saga is currently over 3 games and choices made in the first game will haunt you in the second or third installment.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I keep revisiting Chora's Den to watch the women in latex.No, seriously.The game's amazing.If you play this right after playing Counter Strike, you might get a little frustrated, what with all the character's skill tree and all those decisions and side quests.But that's what makes the game a great RPG.I came here straight from Dragon Age: Origins, and while this game is nothing like that, it's definitely worth buying when not on sale.I mean, think.For a few bucks you could have had a game with stunning visuals(for it's time) hi-tech weapory, space exploration, plenty of decisions that actually affect the game and a spaceship of your own.Did I mention that you have your very own monster truck?The dialogue and storyline's amazing.And there are funny moments, like where a thug argues with an AI, and even goes as far as to threaten it.You obviously have multiple squad members, whom you can change if you wish.I keep Ashley cause she's hot. :PI'm 10 hours in, and I'm nowhere near the end of the game because I'm doing 100% of the side quests and exploration.I'd advise you to do the same.Oh, and Mass Effect 2 is free for a while on Origin, if you're interested!Cheers.

												This game is just so fantastic. If you like star wars, its also a must buy. In Mass Effect, you decide how your character reacts to things, you decide on what orders to issue to your squad, but most of all, you decide the fate of the entire galaxy. Exploration and learning is good fun. Cover and heat sytems work well and smoothly. The Mako vehicle drives alright up until the last mission you use it, then its just a mess. Atmosphere is great. Finding that gun that has one more roman numeral than yours has a great feeling swapping them out realizing your Shepard made a noticable improvement. The few spread out boss battles are a nice challenge. Your going to need to quick save a lot as the actual saves are quite distant. Its an interesting take on the universe as humanity is just being introduced to an already well established galactic democracy. It's also been awhile since ive been so excited for such a great and fitting cinematic end.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioware once again creates an epic RPG! The strength of Mass Effect lies in its narrative that is supplemented by the in-game Codex which painstakingly lays out the future history of Earth, technology and the various alien races. The gameplay involves simple shoot ‘n cover tactics followed by lengthy sessions of exploration and character dialogue. Compared to its sequel and other RPGs, Mass Effect can become a bit tedious when you choose to explore the various planets and again so when it comes to upgrading and managing your equipment. However, these mishaps are easily overshadowed by the game’s plot that will leave sci-fi & RPG fans craving for more of the universe. There are two DLC packs available for Mass Effect: Bring Down the Sky (FREE upon registering) and Pinnacle Station ($5, not worth it).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I bought it again on PC just as an excuse to play through it again with a different feel.While it is the weakest gameplay wise, it is a key game in the story. The characters are amazing and the story is something to hold your interest. You import your character from this game into 2, then into the 3rd game. Your choices carry over and your left with na amazing story you can personlize to make a little bit your own. Fantastic game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A tear comes to my eye as I think about how best to express the pure joy this game brings. That sense of joy can come from climbing to the top of a mountain on a world at furthest reaches of the galaxy and witnessing an alien sunrise, the stunning and original story line, and even looking down at your feet as you board a cargo ship and see the entire universe below you. All these things can only begin to explain the wonders of this game. Yeah, it's good.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have tried a few times to play this game. Last time hard drive broke so I thought I might try again as I was enjoying it.Its really good, a great sci fi game. Really good story a good start to series and still stands up well as an older game.For me its not the most indepth game character wise from Bioware. I did really like the characters and story but it just didnt feel as indepth as Dragon Age.  Its still a really good game well worth playing and Mass Effect 2 is supposed to be amazing. It feels a little slower paced which I dont mind. The side missions some just seem dull and pointless but some of the rewards are pretty cool and do make it worth your while. The character missions I always like to do as I like to get to know the characters but all in all I just wanted to get on with the story which is a shame because theres a galaxy to explore.The characters were cool but it seemed most of it was set up to make you have a relationship with someone. I mean it didnt seem to matter what i said to one of the characters something was gonna happen lol.Still a cool game though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A nice mix of RPG and 3rd person shooter set in an awesome scifi world.  Humans are becoming something more and discover the galaxy and you get to be part of it. You control a team that you need to build in the most effective way possible. Each crew mate that you meet get's stronger through the xp gained during missions. They each have different classes and get different powers which you must use in combination with other powers from other crew members. Optimise squad choixe and evolution then optimise firepower and different powers while adapting to enemy particularities. This 3 part saga (soon to be 4 part)  will let you meet lots of aliens with their specific fighting techniques and specific personalities.

												This game was what got me into the Mass Effect franchise, and I'm happy for that, however the combat style and the way some of the AI works makes it terrable as far as gameplay is concerned (An example being the Rogue VI mission on the moon, where the drones would just rush you with no where to hide). Also if you want to get all the side quests done, you'll spend a lot of time running around the Citadel doing quests more fitting to a MMORPG then a single player game. And the thing I hated most, the conversation tree, don't get me wrong, I'm a Roleplayer, but if two options result in the exact same dialogue, then why bother having both? this often made me feel like I had no influence in the conversation, even though that's one of the core features. But dispite all that, it's a great story, and as I said, it got me into the franchise, so it's still recommended in my books.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played all three of the Mass Effect games 3 times each on Xbox360 as they came out. I bought it again on PC just as an excuse to play through it again with a different feel.While it is the weakest gameplay wise, it is a key game in the story. The characters are amazing and the story is something to hold your interest. You import your character from this game into 2, then into the 3rd game. Your choices carry over and your left with na amazing story you can personlize to make a little bit your own. Fantastic game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The beginning of an epic space opera, Mass Effect manages to deliver a compelling setting as well as a very interesting narrative. With a strong lore beyond its years, few games can compare with such a fully realized title. Though its gameplay lacks the same polish that the subsequent games have, Mass Effect remains a must play for any fan of sci-fi or RPGs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is absolutely brilliant. I didn't realize how much better the first game is ME2 and ME3, until i started replaying ME1 the other day. Grand nostalgia started kicking in and the epicness of this game is on a scale unmatched by any other space game. The level-up system is fleshed out, the characters are fleshed out, decisions have big impacts and the combat is tactical, difficult and awesome. Also, the inventory I happen to like quite a bit, when most people hate it. But thanks to so many people hating it, BioWare completely got rid of it and stripped the game of it's other most important RPG elements for ME2 and ME3. Mass Effect 1 is to ME2 and ME3 what Dragon Age Origins is to Dragon Age 2. The first game of both series' were epic beyond the likes of any other game in it's genre and had so much content it kept you wide-eyed and fully entrapped by it's charm. While the sequels were just stripped down of the best features they once had. Though I have to say that ME2 is still a pretty entertaining and fun game, but didn't do justice to the original.To say the least, if you enjoy space games or RPGs, then this game is a must and you'll probably love it. Admittedly it does take a few hours to really get into the game and the tactical combat takes some getting used to, but it's great fun once you learn. That's all good in my opinion. I enjoy having to learn a  game rather than being thrown into it and it being the same as every other game in it's genre. This game will take you on one of the most memorable journeys you've ever been on in gaming and it will captivate you the entire way through, from the grand music, to the tactical combat, to the storytelling, etc.On a side not, a lot of people also didn't like exploring planets with the Mako, but I think that's one of the best parts. It's fun discovering materials/items and uncovering the secrets of some planets and completing quests on others. Again, if you like space, this game is definitely for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mass Effect 3 was my first Mass Effect game to play when it came out a while back; however, I decided to give the whole triolgy a new start after I bought the first two as a bundle during some Steam sale. I didn't quite remember all the details from ME3, which was good, but I knew enough about the Mass Effect world to where I wasn't completely lost. With that said, finally figuring out all the backstory and references made in ME3 was amazing. Story-wise, the Mass Effect universe is on par with Star Wars and Star Trek. The charaters are developed extremely well, with well thought out insight in each different species. The dialogue and choices are superb. At the end of the day, when you finally save and exit the game, you feel as if you were part of the action. Part of Commander Shepard's odyssey. Going back to reality was always a bummer. Combat-wise the controls were a little loose. Then again, this game is about 7 years old at this point. You get use to the controls, but do not expect very responsive actions and features that most games have today. Most of the side quests (assignments) felt like chores at the end, but I still wanted to get them all done to explore the awesome ME universe. Customization is also not as well-developed as the sequels are. Many times I get stuck with a Shepard wearing a ridiculous looking armour but the stats on it are amazing so I couldn't argue. The decision making (Paragon/Renegade) also provides unique story, meticulous and sometimes stressful choices, and good replayability, even if much of the story is progressively linear. In the end, I can understand why Mass Effect is so popular. The universe draws you in and the gripping story, dialogue, and action make you want to play this game until you have played it 3+ times, exhausting all the different dialogue choices, actions, and play styles you can make in the game. Worth the money. Worth the time. You will regret nothing besides some of the grueling choices you have to make along the way to save the galaxy. But that's what makes this game, this series, perfect.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bioware once again creates an epic RPG! The strength of Mass Effect lies in its narrative that is supplemented by the in-game Codex which painstakingly lays out the future history of Earth, technology and the various alien races. The gameplay involves simple shoot ‘n cover tactics followed by lengthy sessions of exploration and character dialogue. Compared to its sequel and other RPGs, Mass Effect can become a bit tedious when you choose to explore the various planets and again so when it comes to upgrading and managing your equipment. However, these mishaps are easily overshadowed by the game’s plot that will leave sci-fi & RPG fans craving for more of the universe. There are two DLC packs available for Mass Effect: Bring Down the Sky (FREE upon registering) and Pinnacle Station ($5, not worth it).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The greatest space RPG ever created. An intriguing story full of interesting characters, planets to explore, and existential questions to ponder. This game is meant to be played again and again to take in all the fantastic locations, dialogue, and quests. After four playthroughs I can confidently say this is one of the greatest RPGs ever made.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I would love to seriously start playing this again if Steam would release the 2 DLCs for the 1st Mass Effect. That extra content comes in handy when you continue through ME2 & and see your results on ME3. Only system releasing that is Xbox so idk...make a deal with them for the content?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The early parts of the game can be a bit slow (action-wise), and the learning curve for the non-soldier classes can be a little steep. However, the story is gripping (especially the first time through), and the voice acting is excellent.The combat is not as polished as other shooters, but is still fun, and only a component of the total experience. There is potential for replay value, too, with different classes to play, and different decisions to make.Overall, it is an excellent game. It is especially worth playing if you want to play the entire trilogy, because you can transfer your character from game to game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is just so fantastic. If you like star wars, its also a must buy. In Mass Effect, you decide how your character reacts to things, you decide on what orders to issue to your squad, but most of all, you decide the fate of the entire galaxy. Exploration and learning is good fun. Cover and heat sytems work well and smoothly. The Mako vehicle drives alright up until the last mission you use it, then its just a mess. Atmosphere is great. Finding that gun that has one more roman numeral than yours has a great feeling swapping them out realizing your Shepard made a noticable improvement. The few spread out boss battles are a nice challenge. Your going to need to quick save a lot as the actual saves are quite distant. Its an interesting take on the universe as humanity is just being introduced to an already well established galactic democracy. It's also been awhile since ive been so excited for such a great and fitting cinematic end.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Mass Effect trilogy is with out a doubt my favourite, as few games have captivated me in such a scale as these ones. This particular game is the first in the trilogy(obviously) and in many ways what got me into the rpg-genre of gaming. I wasn't a fan of this genre beforehand and for me to get my hands on this game was actually a happy mistake. I got to randomly try out the demo and have never looked back since. The greatest strengts of this game is its grand, epic and interesting story, both ingame and lorewise. Bioware(developer) is also known to craft some of the finest characters/companions around, which makes the whole experience that more awesome. You care about them and want to get to know them better for their great diversity, flaws or stengths. Some of the gameplay may be a bit rusty (It came out in 2007) but if you're in for the story and lore you will not get dissapointed. The sequels will greatly expand on the gameplay, as will your choices. Remember, the Mass Effect saga is currently over 3 games and choices made in the first game will haunt you in the second or third installment.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you haven't played this, you need to do so.  Combine a compelling storyline, a very star-trek feel with a 'This could happen soon' kind of technology level, and a believeable villian with realistic feeling intergalactic politics, and you have Mass Effect.  I simply cannot recommend it hard enough, because a sheer statement of words does not sum up how excellent this game is.  Play it, or miss out on the best ten bucks you could have ever spent in your life.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The intentions of Mass Effect as the beginning of a series are apparent in damn near every aspect of the experience.  In a word: foundation.  It feels like it was designed to be built up upon, because what is here is aesthetically light, but structurally phenomenal.What's immediately striking about Mass Effect given it's nature as an RPG is how well it plays as an action game.  Combat feels polished and dynamic, featuring an automatic cover system that works in tandem with largely artifical environments designed around boxes/wall/etc that leave no doubt as to what can and cannot be used for cover.   The shooting mechanics feel impactful and effective and the overall design accomodates both tactical and run-gun-hav'n-fun forms of play.  Battles can be as dynamic or degenerate strategy as you want them to be and not feel like either is more viable than the other.But as an RPG, it's remarkable how many aspects of the game have been given this effectively tactile sense of physicality.  The ability to select responses through a conversation wheel with a mouse click creates a remarkably natural sense of rhythm to talking with NPCs that closely emulate real life.  There's no artificial time limit to responses either, this all happens as a natural consequence of the design of the system.  The physicality runs even to the more minor tasks such as hacking and navigation, extending the life of what would normally be sloggishly repetative tasks.  Again, as an RPG, it's rather startling just how good this game FEELS to play.So what's not to love?  Well...yeah, we'll get to that, but first things first:You are Commander Shepard, a human who's being eyed at by the Leaders of the Free Galaxy for the prestigious title of Spectre: an Intergalatic Man/Woman of Mystery with a License to Kill.  Things go♥♥♥♥♥♥up due a Spectre Whose Gone Rogue that leaves you with Information Vital to Saving the Galaxy and you are eventually tasked with Taking Him Down only to find that Behind His Power is A Much Greater Power that Threatens to Destroy the Galaxy!  If that all sounds cliche and routine well, that's cause it is.  Again, it feels like a foundation.  It's in the details - the subtleties and nuances they paint upon that very broad canvas - that makes the game's world so rewarding to experience.  The sheer amount of content they put into world building is astounding, but the restraint in not overloading the player with it if they don't want while still having it inform the situations the game creates is certainly worthy of note.The thing to note upon a first run is how deceptively large the game is.  Playing the main quest takes you to only five planets before the endgame.  Some feature hub sections with a few sidequests, but taken as a whole, you could easily breeze through the entire game in only a few hours.  The bulk of the game's content is side quests that have you running willy nilly through dozens of systems in various clusters throughout the galaxy, usually touching upon some various world building content or minor character moments.  They can vary from a simple one-click scan of a planet for resources, to full on multi-planet hopping quests featuring both surface exploration, combat and tense negotiations...and there's SCORES of them!So now...the price that's payed for all this polish and content: The game doesn't look very good.Oh it's technically proficient.  Textures, faces and all are quite up to snuff.  But the design of the game is bare bones.  Any environment not devoted to the main quest is entirely pre-fab and not even randomly generated.  There's only some half dozen variations on them and since they do not change, it get's immediately repetative.  Even the main quest planets feel overly artificial and lifeless.  Mulitple quests end abruplty with nothing more than a pop-up window delivering silent flavor text and while the planet exploration goes a long way towards delivering on the scale the game, the actual landscapes were clearly randomly generated hieghtmaps ripped straight out of a late '90's 3d software program.  And yes, the way the game handles inventory is one of the worst I've seen anywhere ever.  Ya happy?So that's Mass Effect.  A game where all the polish was put into the systems and design rather than the aesthetics, leading to a massive new world for players to explore that felt large, felt good to roleplay and simply play in...all so long as you ignored it'd been filled with blatantly copy/pasted environments.  Playing the game, the intent is very clear that this was to be the building blocks for a more fully realized world to build around their solid mechancis, design and world building.  Ah well...

												This game is absolutely brilliant. I didn't realize how much better the first game is ME2 and ME3, until i started replaying ME1 the other day. Grand nostalgia started kicking in and the epicness of this game is on a scale unmatched by any other space game. The level-up system is fleshed out, the characters are fleshed out, decisions have big impacts and the combat is tactical, difficult and awesome. Also, the inventory I happen to like quite a bit, when most people hate it. But thanks to so many people hating it, BioWare completely got rid of it and stripped the game of it's other most important RPG elements for ME2 and ME3. Mass Effect 1 is to ME2 and ME3 what Dragon Age Origins is to Dragon Age 2. The first game of both series' were epic beyond the likes of any other game in it's genre and had so much content it kept you wide-eyed and fully entrapped by it's charm. While the sequels were just stripped down of the best features they once had. Though I have to say that ME2 is still a pretty entertaining and fun game, but didn't do justice to the original.To say the least, if you enjoy space games or RPGs, then this game is a must and you'll probably love it. Admittedly it does take a few hours to really get into the game and the tactical combat takes some getting used to, but it's great fun once you learn. That's all good in my opinion. I enjoy having to learn a  game rather than being thrown into it and it being the same as every other game in it's genre. This game will take you on one of the most memorable journeys you've ever been on in gaming and it will captivate you the entire way through, from the grand music, to the tactical combat, to the storytelling, etc.On a side not, a lot of people also didn't like exploring planets with the Mako, but I think that's one of the best parts. It's fun discovering materials/items and uncovering the secrets of some planets and completing quests on others. Again, if you like space, this game is definitely for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mass Effect 3 was my first Mass Effect game to play when it came out a while back; however, I decided to give the whole triolgy a new start after I bought the first two as a bundle during some Steam sale. I didn't quite remember all the details from ME3, which was good, but I knew enough about the Mass Effect world to where I wasn't completely lost. With that said, finally figuring out all the backstory and references made in ME3 was amazing. Story-wise, the Mass Effect universe is on par with Star Wars and Star Trek. The charaters are developed extremely well, with well thought out insight in each different species. The dialogue and choices are superb. At the end of the day, when you finally save and exit the game, you feel as if you were part of the action. Part of Commander Shepard's odyssey. Going back to reality was always a bummer. Combat-wise the controls were a little loose. Then again, this game is about 7 years old at this point. You get use to the controls, but do not expect very responsive actions and features that most games have today. Most of the side quests (assignments) felt like chores at the end, but I still wanted to get them all done to explore the awesome ME universe. Customization is also not as well-developed as the sequels are. Many times I get stuck with a Shepard wearing a ridiculous looking armour but the stats on it are amazing so I couldn't argue. The decision making (Paragon/Renegade) also provides unique story, meticulous and sometimes stressful choices, and good replayability, even if much of the story is progressively linear. In the end, I can understand why Mass Effect is so popular. The universe draws you in and the gripping story, dialogue, and action make you want to play this game until you have played it 3+ times, exhausting all the different dialogue choices, actions, and play styles you can make in the game. Worth the money. Worth the time. You will regret nothing besides some of the grueling choices you have to make along the way to save the galaxy. But that's what makes this game, this series, perfect.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												And it begins! This game is incredible. I played this game close to 7 years after its release and it's still amazing. This game is perfect. The story is absolutely engrossing and something you can submerge yourself into, it's like a modern day Star Wars. The characters in this game are so well developed, the grow on you to the point you'll always consider them life long friends. This is an action RPG and the game lives up to that classification. The action is just as riveting as the decisions you'll need to make over the course of the game. Never before has a game put me on the edge of my seat, regarding the consequences of choices I've made. I love the freedom this game offers. The tension builds and builds as you reach the climax. The game play is intuitive and an enjoyable experience. As you build your characters skillsets, you experience such a natural incline of abilites and you can lots of options to build a character with combat skills suited to your preferences. This is game you'll remember. Interested in Mass Effect 2 or 3? Not sure if you'll enjoy Mass Effect because it's almost a decade old? Buy this game, you will not be dissapointed. Not only will it enrich your experience for Mass Effect 2 and 3, it's just downright a great game. You'll soon realize the more Mass Effect in your life, the better. Hell, I even suffered through playing Mass Effect 3 on origin....that's how great this game is!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While perhaps not worth the hype the series has generated over the years, this game is still very good. I really enjoyed the story, and the way it progressed really impressed me. The supporting cast aren't that great (something they improved in Mass Effect 2, sadly with the loss of the great story) but the fact that Shepard develops how you want him to while still remaining an interesting character is no mean feat.It is quite annoying that some conversations that give you options just ignore your choices and just go straight into what the game wants, and I guess it would be tough to make a game which allowed all that but then making games is tough. So I would've liked more freedom to do what I wanted rather than just what the game dictated. Nobody likes a game pretending you have a choice and then just ignoring it. That's just not cool.The combat is perfectly acceptable. I heartily recommend going with the combat-biotic fusion character as then you get the most fun out of your character while still remaining a heavy hitter with weapons. The squad-part of combat is really not at all important, as your squad is not all that effective and they can just about handle themselves. I'm quite glad that they did that though, as I prefer having a squad that does their own thing. They could have made them slightly more clever however. Overall, a very good game with a few drawbacks. Not a brilliant game, but a very good game nonetheless.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mass Effect is one of the first games I've played with multiple different branching storylines... which are actually followed up across future franchise editions. Many games with multiple endings, with a sequel, just assume a given ending. With Mass Effect, the choices you make... matter.Mass Effect 1 is good for a rich storyline. It has some flaws, as in the Mako missions where you have to drive up the side of a hill almost sideways, and gravity is very unrealistic. But, for the most part... it is a fun enough game to play. Most games average around 50-60 hours (as in Final Fantasy)... I spent a little over 120 hours on Mass Effect 1 playing the ""Paragon"" male version and ""Renegade"" female version.

												One of the great RPGs of our time. Mass Effect excells in storytelling and characterization in ways that no other game has. This particular title is most memorable (for me personally) because of the way it introduces and develops the characters in such a fashion that the player truly cares about their fate and building relationships with each and every one.Mass Effect also has solid shooter mechanics. I actually prefer the overheating weapons over the thermal clips from the later games. I also enjoy the combat storm and the way it is incorporated into the strengths and weaknesses of any particular character build. The abilites and leveling are also extremely well executed. I personally found it so rewarding and satisfying that I achieved level 60, but regardless the leveling system successfully helps to add reward during a playthrough.Again, however, what makes Mass Effect such an amazing game is its characters and story progression. To avoid spoilers, I will just say that by the time I was nearing the end of the main story for the first time, I was deeply invested in each individual character's story and that is something that I cannot say about almost any other game experience.Mass Effect exemplifies the great strengths of BioWare in its prime and will forever be a gold standard to which I will compare future titles to.

												You know it, you love it, it's Mass Effect!  Have you ever wanted to be immersed in a believable, complex, engrossing science fiction tale that brings humanity into a galactic forum of sentient species from across the galaxy as they attempt to tackle an unknown nefarious threat?Well? Have you? Of course you have!  What are you waiting for!   This game is...less polished than it could've been.  But if you get past the somewhat...lackluster FPS aspects, and focus more on the RPG-like progression of powerful abilities and the story driven aspects...there's nothing not to love.Also, Jennifer Hale's voice acting as Femme-Shep is exquisitely charged with passion and verve!  Strong female protagonist, if you choose for Shepherd to be female.   I, frankly, found the male voice actor to be neutral in his emotions too often.  I don't believe he threw himself into the role as much.Jennifer Hale sounds like she's the hero who held off a Batarian raid of a human colony single-handedly and against all odds.Anyway, I digress.  If you have the money to burn, and want a good story, this is one of the best in sci-fi. (Mass Effect 3's ending being the only highly-contested part of that statement.)The Normandy isn't going to command itself...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am a child of divorce. When this game came out, I was angry at the world. This game saved me from insanity. It was my safe place. I had never played anything so immersive, anything that made me forget all the♥♥♥♥♥♥in my world like this did. Mass Effect will always be my favorite game. A beautiful story filled with some of the best sci-fi, and most memorable characters ever to be played. My life was different after Mass Effect. I could nitpick over flaws in gameplay, and the occassional bugginess that comes with any bioware game, but it pales in comparison to all the amazing things this game has to offer. If the idea of it at all interests you, buy it. You won't regret it. Sincerely, fan boy			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I actually spent 20 hours in this game in the last 4 days in Steam offline mode, so ignore Steam playtime.Mass Effect was a pleasant surprise for me, because of two reasons: I'm not a fan of space opera and sci-fi, and I couldn't get into one of Bioware's well known title - Dragon Age: Origins. But screw them, let's talk about Mass Effect. The game has messy inventory system, clunky animations, pretty straightforward weapon upgrades and doesn't allow progressing after finishing the main story, aaaaaaand... that's it, that's all my criticism for ME. What can I say more about it? Mass Effect is a well-crafted game from head to toe, with nearly all aspects perfected.First, I freaking love the narrative. In the first 30 minutes, I thought it was some typical pretentious sci-fi piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥that overcomplicates everything, but nope, the story really hooked me in, even it was just a standard good-vs-evil story filled with cliches. I can't tell exactly what I love about ME's story, but it gave me a sense of real progression, and pushed me forward through each events in the game. Sometime intense, sometime emotional and sometime even silly (especially in romance subplots), and of course it doesn't lack ""epicness"" for a sci-fi saga.Next, the dialogues. There's no such thing as illusive choices. In ME, every choice matters, and not all decisions lead to a good end.  I still feel bad because I accidentally shot Wrax on Virmire, had to replay that section. Tip: Spend your points in Charisma or Intimidate, they're very important, don't ignore them.Teammates. Uhuh, this is not your standard companions, your squad mates are TRUE human (or alien) beings with their own unique personality. You know what? I found it more interesting to wandering around the Normandy, talking to my squad mates, rather than exploring the galaxy. And I've never, ever, felt so much difficult in deciding between 2 squad mates' fates. There was no game that made me care so much about my team mates like Mass Effect. Why? Because ♥♥♥♥ you Bioware, you created some of the most memorable and well-developed side characters in any game I've ever played. If I don't see Garrus, Wrex, Liara or Tali in the sequels, many tables will be flipped.Gunplay hasn't aged well, but it's certainly enjoyable. Tons of weapons, upgrades and special biotic abilities. You don't need to be a strategist to play the game, but it certainly helps if you can order your squad mates to assist you on the battlefield.Aargh. why, why did I spend the last 7 years without giving a damn about Mass Effect? Why didn't I know about it sooner? Why did I pass on this masterpiece? And why does Garrus's face look low-textured? Anyway, Mass Effect, 10 ♥♥♥♥ing out of 10, heavily recommended. If you are a fan of RPG or sci-fi, play it already. If you don't give a crap about RPG or sci-fi, then still give it a try, because you might like it as much as I do.			",733,203,38,117,64,9,132

												Wow! I was a bit late to the Mass Effect game, and I had allways heard about it, so cyber monday of 2016 I bought it. It was worth every cent I paid, and more. The storyline was incredible, with alot of suprises and plot twists, that I didn't see coming. I love the large amounts of chat dialogs you have for each converstation, and how each choice effects the game later down the road. The Combat system was great, my only con was that when facing bioitcs, you can sometimes get thrown into a wall or other place to get stuck, but thats an easy fix. I have never been so impressed with a game and the storyline. Looking forward to finish all of the side quests, and importing my game to Mass Effect 2, to continue the story!! I highly recommed this game to anyone who likes a good story game!!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fantastic space rpg with a very interesting universe and story. The game gives you a good deal of customization and has great character interaction. However, the combat is pretty mediocre third person shooter combat for the most part. The vehicle sections can also be quite awkward especially when you are playing the game for the first time. Despite these issues, the shooting is still somewhat satisfying and the game gives you a variety of abilities and weapon addons that make the combat much more interesting. You can get cryo ammo to freeze your enemy, or biotic power that allow you to through your enemies. You also have a good deal of control over you squad which adds a bit more depth to the combat.8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While perhaps not worth the hype the series has generated over the years, this game is still very good. I really enjoyed the story, and the way it progressed really impressed me. The supporting cast aren't that great (something they improved in Mass Effect 2, sadly with the loss of the great story) but the fact that Shepard develops how you want him to while still remaining an interesting character is no mean feat.It is quite annoying that some conversations that give you options just ignore your choices and just go straight into what the game wants, and I guess it would be tough to make a game which allowed all that but then making games is tough. So I would've liked more freedom to do what I wanted rather than just what the game dictated. Nobody likes a game pretending you have a choice and then just ignoring it. That's just not cool.The combat is perfectly acceptable. I heartily recommend going with the combat-biotic fusion character as then you get the most fun out of your character while still remaining a heavy hitter with weapons. The squad-part of combat is really not at all important, as your squad is not all that effective and they can just about handle themselves. I'm quite glad that they did that though, as I prefer having a squad that does their own thing. They could have made them slightly more clever however. Overall, a very good game with a few drawbacks. Not a brilliant game, but a very good game nonetheless.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												And it begins! This game is incredible. I played this game close to 7 years after its release and it's still amazing. This game is perfect. The story is absolutely engrossing and something you can submerge yourself into, it's like a modern day Star Wars. The characters in this game are so well developed, the grow on you to the point you'll always consider them life long friends. This is an action RPG and the game lives up to that classification. The action is just as riveting as the decisions you'll need to make over the course of the game. Never before has a game put me on the edge of my seat, regarding the consequences of choices I've made. I love the freedom this game offers. The tension builds and builds as you reach the climax. The game play is intuitive and an enjoyable experience. As you build your characters skillsets, you experience such a natural incline of abilites and you can lots of options to build a character with combat skills suited to your preferences. This is game you'll remember. Interested in Mass Effect 2 or 3? Not sure if you'll enjoy Mass Effect because it's almost a decade old? Buy this game, you will not be dissapointed. Not only will it enrich your experience for Mass Effect 2 and 3, it's just downright a great game. You'll soon realize the more Mass Effect in your life, the better. Hell, I even suffered through playing Mass Effect 3 on origin....that's how great this game is!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I Should Go......Are the words that I occasionally see on the faces of people whom I introduce Mass Effect to. Naturally, it's a given response, since this game is a far cry from what many are used to on both the RPG and Shooting front. I remember almost throwing this game into the recycling bin while I had the PS3 version, since I couldn't figure out how to zoom out on the galaxy map (my fault entirely for forgetting that the circle button exists).Sure, the game does present a few faults here and there, such as the awkward shooting/cover mechanics, absurdly long cooldown times for powers, optional yet completely barren side missions, limited auto-save points, [some] overpowered enemy biotics as well as a few other caveats that I won't go into detail here, which can completely cripple someone's interest in Mass Effect. A sad thing, since the feeling of carrying over your complete save to Mass Effect 2 is unparalleled on so many levels. Bioware has always been a dominant forefront for the story driven rpg market, and Mass Effect is no exception. Thus, enjoyment as a whole can be severely limited if the player refrains from making a personal investment in the overall lore, story and characters. And yes, Mass Effect goes above and beyond in providing all three, while also establishing an atmosphere of its own, which makes it stand out heavily among all the other space games on the market. Top-tier Canadian science fiction everybody!Many of the choices you make in this game will impact you later, especially when carrying over your saves to the next two games. Who you save, what you say, when you choose to do missions, which path you follow, undoubtedly adds a lot of ""Mass"" to the ""Effect"" of your decisions, and definitely adds weight to what happens later in the first game alone. Plus, the PC port is outstanding, enabling you to use most, if not all of your powers during combat in real time, rather than always opening the power wheel on the console versions. Equipment management and gun modding is also much more direct/less in your face due to the redesigned menu system. The new hacking minigames are also a nice touch as well. It's almost as if PC was Bioware's most prioritized platform from the get-go. Definitely better than the delayed PS3 version, which encountered many lip-sync errors, missing textures and frame rate issues. Also didn't help that it always took 12 seconds to save, where the PC port only requires half a second, with the addition of a very handy quick save button.You'll need to install a few mods and edit the .ini files though if you wish to remove some small hitches, but that can be accomplished easily through the many worthwhile guides for this game (I'd recommend uncapping the game's framerate and installing MEUITM, which allows you to run the game higher than 720p and upscales a lot of old textures). It's not necessary, but the experience is undoubtedly more rewarding with those fixes.I won't go into detail on any of the main story points and characters, since I wish for anyone reading this review who doesn't own the game yet to find out for themselves. Sure, Mass Effect isn't for everybody, and it might seem underwhelming at first for many Star Wars/Doctor Who enthusiasts out there, but the series as a whole quickly makes a name for itself if you give it time, especially if you make it to the third game, and the eventual fourth if you love the series that much : )			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not quite the full kilo MASS EFFECT is a mixed bag of a game: everything about it is good in some ways but not in others. The most notable achievement perhaps is the rich storyline and detailed universe created by the developers (there is plenty to read here -- I started by reading every word but confess to scanning some texts as the game progressed). The graphics are good in parts but not in others (I know this game came out in 2007 but then so did Crysis). The voice acting is overall pretty good and there are plenty of branches to the dialogue trees. And this is where MASS EFFECT’s strengths lie: in the role playing aspects of the game. You’re given the opportunity to be the good guy or the not so good guy, depending on how you wish to play. Less successful is the combat, which, for the most part, failed to engage. Also the side missions are very repetitive and dull. The vehicle you get to drive on numerous occasions bounces around like a drunken bouncy thing, and there are endless elevators that take too long to ascend or descend. Oh, and the UI for selecting skills, weapons etc. is needlessly complex. Overall MASS EFFECT is worth playing but the whole experience is oddly detached and vaguely unsatisfying. I have MASS EFFECT 2 also. I understand it’s much improved on the first.3/5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very good game. it has story and a lot of plot. Somehow asari reminds me of polish women. I guess, because their round face. But somehow you're getting totally atracted to those women (or species, because they don't have gender, should I say they're mono-gender). First impression was like it will be just bunch of conversation and little action, but later in the game the amounts of action, interaction and exploration are getting equal parts. the little thing, that bothered me, is that after finishing main quest, game ends. That made me really sad, because it left a lot of unfinished side quests. Better to have multiple saves, to have a possibility to start somewhere, where you can do some side quests. All in all, that's  a good game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A vast, exciting journey that I can only recommend.Has a great plot, defined by the player themself and rich, interesting characters (That even further improve in the upcoming games)However DO be wary that the game is quite buggy. Be sure to save regularly to revert if anything freezes/crashes.You may also experience a strange lighting glitch through the entirety of two missions later in the game, this can, however, be resolved with a quick google search.Have fun with Mass Effect!

												Very good game. it has story and a lot of plot. Somehow asari reminds me of polish women. I guess, because their round face. But somehow you're getting totally atracted to those women (or species, because they don't have gender, should I say they're mono-gender). First impression was like it will be just bunch of conversation and little action, but later in the game the amounts of action, interaction and exploration are getting equal parts. the little thing, that bothered me, is that after finishing main quest, game ends. That made me really sad, because it left a lot of unfinished side quests. Better to have multiple saves, to have a possibility to start somewhere, where you can do some side quests. All in all, that's  a good game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I finally played this game after years of raving reviews and friend suggestions... What can I say? It qualifies for the hype tremendously, it's a fantastic work of storytelling if I've ever seen one. The lore is great, the alen races are so cool (I exclusively used Wrex and Garrus for every single mission.), and the choices feel powerful.All in all, I'd say this is a solid 8/10, with two points deducted for the car being so awful to drive with keyboard controls and the slow♥♥♥♥♥elevators. Also, the maps feel a wee bit linear.... However, this is still a must-buy for any sci-fi fan or narrative fan.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mass Effect is quite simply my favourite game series. It all started with this first installment which introduces us to an immersive open galaxy where the decisions we make through gameplay and dialogue options shape our journey along throughout our time in the game. You play as a Commander of your own ship and are tasked with bringing a rogue Spectre to justice. Along the way you visit numerous planets and environments with a squad of team mates you recruit along the way. The character interactions between you and your squad truly shape your experience playing the game as you begin to learn about their backgrounds and understand their motivations for fighting alongside you.The plot is straightforward with an engaging villain (the rogue Spectre Saren) and develpos at a steady pace with many more options for side quests that help build and shape the world building, or galaxy building I should say.  Playing as Commander Shepard you have the option to play nicely (paragon) or rather roughly (renegade) while dealing with your dialogue wheel options, allowing to to shape your character's personality. I personally prefer the paragon route.Any downsides I would mention are the somewhat clunky mechanics during fire fights and the difficulty there can sometimes be when you try and fail to take cover. The graphics have aged compared to the more recent installments but  can still be considered decent. I highly reccommend giving the Mass Effect game series a go. It will change your perception of sci-fi RPGs for the better, and not to mention there are two jaw-dropping sequels to sink your teeth into after this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 There isn't enough positive words to describe my love for the game and it's counter-parts. TL;DR - Brilliant storyline, immersive galaxy and worlds to visit. The characters and chemistry between you and character you meet are one of the things that makes Mass Effect so great. A truly brilliant RPG for those who love Science Fiction and action games.As you can tell by the amount of time I've spent playing this game, I've done quite a few playthroughs (I've lost count of how many times I've played Mass Effect, but it's an abnormally large number). Bioware really has a knack of combining a great storyline and character development together with gameplay and customisation. Of course, this was before EA really got them by the balls and milked their franchise dry. First things first, here is what I LOVED about this game. - The story (as mentioned many times above) could not be any better;  immediately you're thrown into the story, as Commander Shepard, with the Alliance Navy, on your way to Eden Prime to check out some Prothean artifacts and screw up whatever plan the bad guys had going.  The different plot points blend together perfectly; the introduction of Saren Arterius, the Geth, the Citadel and your Spectre ranking, it all just comes and goes so well. The interaction with characters and potential romance options really puts the player in the game and the experiences really stick with you.- The lore/canon behind the different points of the game and the background to the game is brilliant; I've spent many hours external of the game reading up on the Mass Effect Wikia page about different planets, key events (like the discovery of the Mass Relay near Pluto) and the technology seen within the game. Players can learn everything and more about the Mass Effect universe without even leaving the game, the codex contains lots and lots of sub-sections pointing to various information about the universe, with the player being able to add more and more accessible canon stories to the codex by interacting with certain items or buildings in game.- Character customisation is really in-depth and customisable; right off the bat, you are given the choice to edit your character's name, appearance, classification and background story. The appearance customisation options are alright, it's pretty default across a lot of RPG games. The class system is great also, with different classes offering the player different weapon choices, in-game powers and abilities. By selecting a character's background story, it really allows you to set up your characters morals for whatever way you wish to play;  whether you want to be a badass Male/Female Shepard who doesn't ask questions and shoots first, or a negotiator, who can talk their way out of anything , you have those choices in Mass Effect.- In-game levelling up and point assignment to you and your squadmates works very well; you have lots of options to add points to specific abilites that will become more accurate, powerful or varied with you and your team in combat and in dialogue. You can also access all your squad's character profiles on the Normandy and customise each one individually, as well as assign different squadmates to you with different missions.- The variety of weapons and mods available is huge to say the least; you can modify any weapon to have different effects on enemies, have a fast fire rate or more accuracy to name a few, as well as purchase or loot newer, more powerful weapons and equip them to you and your squadmates. The same is said for armor and omni-tools, which too can be upgraded by newer items. Now, for the things I was not so much a fan of in Mass Effect. - Off the bat I'm going to appeal to any of you graphic predators; this game is not high-end, cutting edge in the graphics department, it's pretty meh for a game that came out in 2007, compare to the likes of Assassin's Creed or Crysis that came out the same year. But available mods can greatly improve in-game textures and such if it really bothers you.- In-game, the mechanics of combat and everything combat-related is not really that great; the whole cover system, FOV and freeze screen selection is alright, but the newer Mass Effect 2 and 3 definitely improve on this game's mechanics.- The exploration options in the game are pretty linear, but definitely better than Mass Effect 2 and 3. Every world just kind of looks the same but in different colours or with a few different bases re-arranged. The mako is also a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to command around when exploring, getting stuck on mountain sides or in ditches and causing a lot of awkward situations. To conclude my review of Mass Effect;  this game and it's counter-parts are my pride and joy of video games. The game overall is so well made and the elements of it just work together fantastically, and for   £7.99, I think it's worth every penny   (or wait until the Steam sales, where I've seen it sell for £1.99 many times).I highly recommend you invest in this game if you like RPGs, Science Fiction or want to play a game you'll get lost in over and over again, for hours on end.

												Mass Effect is (in my own opinion) one of the best games I've ever played. Few games were able to rival its ability to captivate me. I've played through the entire trilogy on console so many times I lost count, and eventually decided to get the first two games here on steam. I love nearly everything about this game, including the shooting mechanics that so many people seem to have a problem with; It just never bothered me. This one is my favorite in the series, and I would recommend it to any RPG or Shooter fan alike.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 A milestone in RPG history. Simply put, Mass Effect is a masterpiece of storytelling. I cant tell you how many times I've replayed this game, and still find new things. Characters you wish were real are all about you as you take on the role as the titular Commander Shepard.Music and gameplay are great to. Shooting mechanics are a little bit ropey but I never any issues with it.If you've never played any of the Mass Effect games, get in on the ground floor and play the original first. I stand as one of the few who actually enjoys the first one just as much as the second, which some call the best RPG of all time. There is simply no reason for anyone to miss out on this game. 10/10!   ",310,55,10,46,33,3,47

Being able to move your game form one game to the other is an amazing concept. I was so excited to start mass effect 2 with my choices formthe first game. Also because I love choices based video games where your choices actually have a drastic impact on your game. By the end of the game (no spoilers, promise) there will choices which will change the rest of your experience which I hesitated a lot but this is what I love about it too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I don't really think you need another positve review why this game is good but there you go.Well balanced RPG skills and levelling. Along with action, combat. Dialogue.Honestly this game is near perfect.The only real issues are that the side missions are terrible, they all take place in the same warehouse.There are a fair few bugs that seem to have you randomnly float and get stuck in things.Graphical glitches as well. It's not all that polished but if you can get past that, then it's an experience you need to have.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well the big♥♥♥♥♥Space Opera RPG is pretty decent. It has got downsides, like having unremarkable gameplay resemblance to past Bioware games (most notably KotOR 1+2), elevator sim mini-games, half of the weapon and armor upgrades being completely useless, level scaling (why.jpg), copy-paste dungeon layouts (dungeon meaning the exact same buildings on every side-quest planet), and character building + skill trees that are so easy and limiting that it makes character/party builds in Final Fantasy VII look complex (which is not so surprising seeing the dichotomy between the KotOR games and their earlier games, Baldur's Gate for example). Also semi spoiler warning, the background lore and characters are very reminiscent of KotOR games. It is not direct copypaste but it is noticeable, but the quests and characters have their own unique flavors to them.But what's great about it? The story, music, characters, and the element of choice in the game. I clocked 62 hours into the game because the characters in my party entertained me (mostly Wrex) and the feeling of traveling to distant galaxies to explore them (and there are MANY of them, you'll be playing for hours) as a captain of my own ship and alien crew was too much fun.

The main quest is around 5-10 hours long, even longer if you do all the side quests.

												Cons :- The Mako makes me want to kill myself. - The minigame to open/mine/analyze sh_its is lame.- Every planets are empty, dead and look alike. One planet per instagram filter.Pros : - Pretty much everything else. I wanna kiss Bioware for making such great games sometimes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mass Effect is pretty cool, I guess.You play as Shepard, who can be either male or female, but I played him as a man, so I will be addressing him as a he.Sorry Anita. The game takes place in the future where I somehow haven't conquered the world. Humanity, in its efforts to into space, exluding Poland, find a ancient alien relic called the Mass Relay at the edge of the solar system. They activate it, which is apparently a big no-no, and starts a interstellar war with a alien race called the Turians, it's okay though because you can bang one later. All greviances lost. Depending on the backstory you picked for Shepard, there is a chance he can compete with Batman on the world's deadest parents competition. As part of the Earth military, Shepard is sent off to a planet called Eden Prime where he must find out what happened to the country bumpkins and their space farms. He finds corpses, oh no! After the death of a Spectre, this games version of the hall monitors, Shepard is brought to the forefront of the galactic community as the first human hall monitor. Gonna monitor those halls so good. Through his Star Wars journey, Shepard discovers new friends, bitter enemies, and discovers his infatuation for blue buttcheeks, you go Shepard, get that blue berry. The combat is a mix between RPG elements and cover based shooting. You hide behind chest-high walls while popping out occasionally to shoot some fool or hit them with your Jedi mind powers. Like all older Bioware games, Mass Effect likes to tell you what's going on. There is a codex that covers aliens, places, alien places, weapons, alien weapons, goblin darts, and historical events, and alien historical events... Did I mention the aliens? They're kind of important.  I appreciate the time they took into making the game feel like it has it's own world instead of just being a series of events. The story isn't the greatest thing ever, but it does enough to get you lost in it and forgetting that you live on a raft going down the Mississippi because you won one too many hobo fights without throwing the match. Let's see you catch me now, Booker. Should you play Mass Effect? The characters are fun to be around and the story and gameplay is engaging enough to keep you interested. Your journey for blue butt cheeks should last you a few hours and it will probably keep you interested enough to play the sequel. Not the second sequel though, don't do that to yourself, you're beautiful and don't deserve that. I give Mass Effect two butt cheeks out of ten.  President Kennedy was the fastest random speaker in the world with upwards of 350 words per minute.

												Fantastic. Absolutely incredible. A space-faring action RPG!I love the crap out of this game. The combat, the weapons, the skill tree, the story, everything. Fabulous. Well done, Bioware.The story is enthralling, and you really feel like you're fighting to save the galaxy. The twists and turns are delicious and surprising. The combat system is fantastic. Finally a run-and-gun style of game that doesn't require you to hunt around for tons of freaking ammo. Instead guns have limitless ammo, but you can't fire too much or they'll overheat and be useless for a short time. Really a great mechanic, I love it. Scrounging and searching for ammo while playing was always annoying and immersion breaking for me in other games. The skill tree is great, very in-depth. You have a lot of choices to make and can make a unique character. I could play this game twenty times twenty different ways and STILL have different paths to take and different characters to create. Well done.The voice acting is fantastic. Love it.Overall a wonderful game. 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Even if I give the game a thumbs up, this one is not for me. There are a few things that really put me off from playing through this game. The combat system is horrible. Fallout 3 struggled to not become a FPS and somehow it worked for the most part, but in this game it just doesn't work either way. It's not a FPS and not an action RPG either. The loot system has been 'simplified' to a point where you keep getting the same items over and over again. You can modify weapons and ammo though.The story is okay, but it didn't really catch me. Maybe the quite obvious build up for the main character to become the saviour of the universe was a bit too much. The voice acting for the main character does its part by simply being not good.You can travel to other systems than the ones covered by the main story, but they are boring and at best filled with some generic structures without any deeper meaning. You explore those planets using a vehicle that has one of the worst controls and physics I've ever encountered in a computer game.The visuals are good for a game from 2008, but the music doesn't really work for the title. It's very bland electronic music that would rather fit in an elevator.I won't finish the game even if I invested over 16 hours into it so far as I don't see it becoming really interesting and the overall gameplay is just not satisfying. Why I still give it a thumbs up? I still think it's worth a try even if I personally don't like it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I finished this at the 42 hour mark. While I really enjoyed the game. Some parts of it were polished and others seemed a bit clunky. The game is showing its age a bit. After disabling some of the loading cutscenes and avoiding elevators at all costs I was able to enjoy the story and exploration. It reminded me of Star Trek quite a bit. I'm hoping they polished it up a bit more in ME2.			",177,21,3,33,17,1,43

												Sure, Mass Effect 1 doesn't have the combat system Mass Effect 2 does...But Mass Effect 1 takes the Mass Effect franchise back to its roots, with rich RPG aspects and choices, when you get a paragon or renegade choice in here, it actually matters.Also the story before Mass Effect 2 is worth watching/playing, you get to make key decisions that will change the world of Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3. (Previous choices and actions from Mass Effect 1 may change Mass Effect 3, while it was not obvious if they did in Mass Effect 2).I do recommend buying and trying this fantastic RPG once more made by Bioware!

A choice in ME2 could limit a mission in ME3, or a quick snap decision in ME1 could get your charecters killed in ME2. Love intrests, open world missions, and stunning storylines makes these three games a must for any avid gamer.			",196,4,4,27,26,0,52

Taking on the role of Shepard, you make huge in-game decisions on the spot at times, that will ultimately effect the outcome of your life, your crew, their feelings towards you, the actual story of the game, and even the story of Mass Effect 2! I can not stress to you enough how much I thouroughly enjoyed this game and the amount of content it has. My review will never do it justice, so buy this ♥♥♥♥ing game and enjoy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game sets up a very rich and deep universe with lots of unique dialogue and text (logs) to read which make the game feel a LOT bigger than it actually is. The main story in the sequels might be longer and intense but they don't evoke the feeling of being in a massive universe like this one does.Gameplay wise, it's a bit lacking to be honest - the dialogue choices can be really misleading at times, the combat hasn't aged well and the levels feel a bit sterile or even stale (ex. planetary exploration) at times. Mass Effect 2 might have fixed these issues but at the cost of the more deeper RPG elements of this one.The sense of scale and all the little story elements that are hidden in Mass Effect make it a great game, well worth replaying even a few years after release, even knowing it all amounts to nothing (ME3)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great RPG/FPS with a decent story.  Has the potential for excessive inventory management though, which is one of the good things fixed by the sequels.  I didn't enjoy the vehicle portion, and it seems underdeveloped for what it was.  Too much roaming around a baren landscape looking for resources breaks the storyline and fps action.  The way that the story changes based on your actions, and that it caries over into ME2 and ME3 is genius and I hope more titles take this route.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												590 hours.  Thats 24 unblinking, unsleeping days with the crew of the Normandy.According to the combined statistics of Steam, and Origin. Over a hundred fourty hours went into the original Mass Effect (four playthroughs), 289 hours into Mass Effect 2 (six playthroughs), and 219 hours into Mass Effect 3 (two compleate playthroughs, many incompleate) and 8 hours into ME4 Andromeda.Commander Shepard and her crew(no one should play as male Shep imho), have done plenty of galaxy saving, and stirring up,  under my control. They fought, robots, clones, politicians, and reporters. They made love to aliens, hate to aliens, and even saved a race from going compleatly extinct!  We laughed, cried, got wasted, and most importantly fought beside one another through thick and thin.They're my friends.OK, they're not really my friends; claiming to be buddies with imaginary characters is a little too geeky even for me. The Mass Effect series is not without its flaws, and some are truly Reaper-sized. But it has gripped me like nothing else in the history of video games, and video games and I go back a pretty long way (but I'll never betoo old for video games)!The Mass Effect universe is that rare thing—a fully-realized science fiction game setting that stands up to the likes of Star Trek or Star Wars. The universe in which the games take place has a rich and complex backstory, and even better, it's not a rich and complex back story that the player has to have info-dumped into his head. This isn't The Old Republic, where you have to read thousands of awful Kevin J. Anderson ""Extended Universe"" novels and have a working knowledge of the seven prime forms of lightsaber combat to get the most out of the game.There's depth in the backstory, but it's not the kind of depth that ever compelled me to memorize the game's codex entries. (Do you really need to know that the ""First Contact War"" between humans and Turians started because humans activated a mass relay in violation of council law and that the war culminated in the siege of Shanxi? No. It's wonderful flavor, but it's not mandatory knowledge.) The world is alive and compellingly real just through dialogue and character actions, without needing endless narration. The first game's opening title crawl essentially says, ""This is the future and aliens are real and you are a space soldier. Go."" That's enough.Instead of a galactic civics lesson, Mass Effect focuses on a human, the forever-first-nameless Commander Shepard, and her fight against the ancient Reapers, an enemy that aims to rid the galaxy of advanced sentient life for a whole bunch of really complicated reasons. That fight is the central focus of all three games, though Shepard's path from soldier to savior twists and turns and doubles back on itself like a demented snake.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game. If you like RPGs, then you'll love this game. I only played ME3 before I played any other Mass Effect games, and this one has proved why its a must have in only 8 hours of play. Pros:-Runs well on my system (i5 3570k GTX 770) its a 6 year old game so I think I'd be right to assume that it should rune fine on most systems -has extensive dialogue options -Interesting plot-Good graphics for the time-Characters are interesting-The ambiance of locations really make the game feel alive! For example, the Citadel. -The gameplay is fun, and not very conky-I find that the cover system is a lot more advanced than the ones that are offered in other AAA games released today, its pretty adaptive. Cons: -The inventory system isn't all that great-Sometimes there's a bit of screen tearing -If you don't like RPGs and don't really care much about lore and are looking for an fps, then this game won't really stand out for you. Overall, its a great game, and it never hurts to pick it up on a sale and try it. You will most probably enjoy it! 9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is one of the best games, that has ever been created. Drew Karpyshyn wrote a legendary story around the Mass Effect title. The music is amazing and intense, gets you every time. The planets are fascinating, the side missions are fun, and the story once again... I had to play this game twice. First time i didn't complete any side missions, because the story grabbed me, and didn't let go. I wanted to kill that turian so bad, and everytime i got close, something happened, or some major information turned up why the Protheans died. It took me about 11 hours for the first run, but i realised, that this game has so many planets, and many more assignments, and I started all over again. It took more than 20 hours to get to the end this time, but it was totally worth it. Every minute of this is game is a gem. Oh, and if you decide to play this game, then consider every decision you make. They may have severe outcome in ME2 and 3.If you liked this game, and it's story, you will probably like Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic as well, and if you like reading, I would suggest, that the Darth Bane trilogy is the one to read, from Drew Karpyshyn.

												This is the start of something special. Three games and 100 hours later I sat back and thought ""wow - that was a hell of a ride"". A superior game in terms of story telling and character development, combat is a second consideration in my opinion, far outpaced by getting to known the Mass Effect galaxy. If you want an RPG adventure that takes you to some amazing locations with a detailed and intriguing story full of consequences for your actions and a good dosage of humour and sorrow, start your journey here and I don't hink you'll regret it. Be warned that this is not a heavily action packed game - there are long periods of dialogue and some people won't want to be burdened with that. This game *might* not be for the action hungry.

												10/10 for mass effect 1+2 i normally do not play single player games but this is an exception you have to make Brilliant in depth storyline packed with guns Biotic ""Star wars"" powers along side aliens exploration buying selling gear. you take on the Role as Shepard a possible Spectre in the making ""universal Badass who kicks people's asses"" make choices in conversations like instigating or complimenting etc etc find new crew members and add them to your team and when its all done take your player from mass effect 1 into mass effect 2 No progression loss just pick that♥♥♥♥♥♥right back up i Highly recommend this game one of my all time favourate's and i aint even a sci-fi fan. I do not Recommend playing Mass Effect 2 without completing Mass effect 1 though it would be a crying shame anyways all the best hope my review helped in some way			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played Mass Effect twice, once with a female engineer Shepard and once with a male vanguard Shepard. If you like the Dragon Age series and you don't mind a more shooter-like style of fighting, this is the game for you. But even if you're not familiar with it, this game is a lot of fun for everyone I would say.The character development and the decisions (good/evil) make things interesting and all the different companions really add to the storyline. The vehicle (Mako) is an absolute nightmare but you kinda get used to it and I even spoke of it fondly by the end of the game.The planets and views in this game are absolutely stunning, even if you don't have the best graphics (like me). I started Mass Effect 2 now because I loved this game so much.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It did a great job of introducing me to a whole bunch of new philosophical questions at a very basic level when I was 15-16. A great alternative to pamphlets when you need to talk to your 15 year old kid about ending the life support of some crazy lady's husband.One of the available side-quests (colonist background) was one of my favorite moments in any game I've ever played, and was more touching to me than even something like Undertale was.This game played a small role in shaping the person I am, but it did so by presenting me with options and making me choose from them - not by forcing me to play the galaxy's hero or villain. Highly recommended, although parts of the game do show their age these days.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wow. What a fantastic experience this game was.I've heard so much about this game before actually getting myself to finally play it. Mainly because I'm not a fan of SCI-FI or shooter. Well I wasn't, before I started Mass Effect. This game is incredible. It will drag you in with it's fantastic gameplay, brilliantly written story with massive lore, amazing character development, beautiful music, beautiful landscapes, unique atmosphere, masterfully done voice acting and some of what are probably one of the most memorable characters in the game history. This is one of the rare games I actually finished. I have the tendency to play too many things at once to focus on a single game alone. This game, however, was an exception and getting it was probably one of the best decisions I've made in my life. I got it on sales for an € or so, but it is not only worth it's original price, but double that. I recommend this game to everyone everywhere that cherishes brilliant dialogues, deep character development, huge lore behind the main story, for people that don't want to just walk straight forward and shoot stuff, but for people that enjoy exploring the world they are in, for people that enjoy making decisions and think logically. Truly a masterpiece.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great futuristic RPG based on our universe in somewhat fantasy setting. You play as commander Shepard who is pretty much a one man, a one ship crew army. Wont spoil much, this game has great story, a lot of characters and character interaction via cut scene dialogues. Great galaxy to explore with a lot of planets to land on, stations to visit and side quests to do. Has a lot of choice and consequence so think carefully what you say, as the response will shape your character to be good or evil. Game has great visuals, voice acting and animations. Make sure you keep your saves if you plan on playing ME 2, ME 3, etc., as you can transfer them and keep your progress and story over to the next game. I enjoyed this a lot, one of the best if not the best sci-fi RPG of my time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of those games that people seem to either love or just like.  I have never found anyone who hated it.  I am firmly in the ""love"" category.  One of those singleplayer experiences that you will remember forever.  Also, another one of the rare games that I find myself coming back to over and over again.  Like Deus Ex, it is basically a shooter with RPG elements (a TPS instead of an FPS).  Also like Deus Ex, you will find that there are often choices that you face in campaign that will change the gameplay and direction of the rest of the game.  Mass Effect has a perfect balance of choice, action, customizing, freedom, and intrigue to keep you coming back over and over again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game, love the comabt, story, and in-game exploration. Few issues with textures and going into cover during combat, but it is what it is.Huge negative for me is the poor save system. Really hate losing 10-15 minutes of progress just because the game doesn't save because I didn't reach a virtual checkpoint. I can manually save all I want, but I'll still be forced to revert back to the last checkpoint the game saved at. This is a huge issue especially during boss battles. Sure, I shouldn't be able to save during a fight or in the boss arena, but I should be able to save one room before the boss and not 50 rooms back.I'm playing on Normal and love the game, but I think I'll be forced to play on Easy just so I can get around this asinine save system.

Posted: July 8, 2016
												Mass Effect is an amazing game.I first played it years ago when I was a young teenager,  when it was the only ME game out there and it shaped what I expected of gaming from then on. Everything from the atmosphere of the game (the music in particular is something to behold) to the narrative and how it plays out all feels well thought-out and engaging. Some of the plot and side-missions feel like they're plucked from generic sci-fi plotlines and remuddled a bit, but in ME's own way, it owns those factors and you no longer think ""That whole alien queen speaking telepathically to someone has been done before"" and rather think ""Mass Effect did it and did it well."" Your rampage across the galaxy to find this villain who's become a harbinger for the end of life as we know it is fun, and you care about it. Is it the same as every other game where you chase a world-ending villain and his/her catastrophes? Yep. Still fun.While, at this point, the graphics are a little outdated, you occasionally see something jaw dropping in Mass Effect. Smoke drifting diagonally away from lava-coated vistas (that you're DRIVING THROUGH) or a blinding, lilac sun on an alien horizon can, once-in-a-while, take your breath away.The dialogue is meticulously thought-out and well acted (while sometimes sounding a LITTLE dry) and it makes for a great dialogue-system where you know what you choose to say can and will have an effect on the outcome of a mission. It's one of the first games I played that implemented this. Although, while you have choices in ME, all those anastamosing plotlines end you up in the same place. That's not a downside (insert a philosophical quote about inevitability and fate here.) You still feel in control of your character and your future though and that's as much as you can ask for in a game.Gameplay-wise, it's fun, if a little simple. There aren't any puzzling moments (unless you count getting temporarily lost in one of the many hubs.) The game repeats a little when you have to play the same fight a few times to win. That's not a criticism. I'm all for old-school, 'git good' gaming.There are really only three or four main things you'll be doing in this game; shooting at and ducking from a wide variety of clever(ish) enemies, wandering around hub areas looking for answers to life's questions (and convincing people to do things), driving around in the MAKO (amazingly fun for something so simple) to explore planets, and zipping around the galaxy map to go do one of the three aforementioned activities.The combat is FUN and simple, but your two AI counterparts are fairly stupid and don't like to use cover like you do, so will get shot ALOT. Ordering them about feels like you're having to baby two other people whilst not dying in a firefight yourself, but you're Commander Shepherd. You can do it.Wandering back and forth in hub worlds like the Citadel is fun for about five minutes as it's all rather pretty, but eventually, talking to one character then running back to talk to another can get a bit boring and you wind up wanting to leap into some action again, which you can't without finishing your conversational wanderings. And prepare for ALOT of elevators. It's M.E.'s way of loading parts of maps while you're travelling but it takes you out of things a bit and they make you use elevators a whole lot. Boring, sadly.Planet exploring is fun and scenic (did I mention this game is beautiful?) especially in the MAKO. The vehicle is fun to drive around, even if it does have some crazy oversteer, but what do you expect when you're on the surface of some low-G moon driving over dunes and dustscapes? The guns feel powerful but don't bother trying to shoot anything near you as the thing can't aim down and the MAKO is quite tall. Just run over the enemies, dammit.They've put so much effort into fleshing out the characters and histories in this game; of you, your squad mates and beyond and it's all well voice acted. You can feel sparks fly not only between you and your teammates, but you notice which squadmates like each other and where rivalries lie in all the tiny ways. And everybody has their flaws. I love Ashley. No denying it there. I love her go-gettem attitude and her out of nowhere attraction to poetry. But she's also super racist against aliens, although she denies it. These aren't character tropes that come out of nowhere. Ashley's lived a life before you knew her and she's willing to tell you about it if you get to know her, from her gung-ho attitude she cultivated with her sister, to her father's love of poetry handed down to her, to her stoic patriotism towards Earth and Humanity leading to her distrust of alien races. Like her or not, she's human (irony intended); so much more than just a 3D rendered cardboard cutout. Now apply that detail to the dozens of characters, locations and races in Mass Effect. (All except Saren, the main villain of the game, who seems to just be a laughing, evil face with no deep backstory other than a foreboding 'he used to be what you are now.') They've sat down and thought this universe out. We NEED more people to do this when making games. It's probably the biggest selling point of Mass Effect. The galaxy has existed long before you arrived and will go on long after you leave (until ME3 maybe). You can ignore all of it; skip past the expositional dialogue or ignore informative text boxes altogether. But if you want the lore, it's all there and it's beautiful. Plus, they make a GOOD attempt at sciencing everything well. It's what makes for 'science-fiction' rather than 'space-fantasy.'So, to sum up:+This game is STILL beautiful after all these years.+The people and locations are so detailed in lore and history that you can't help but love them all. +You feel in control of yourself in a vast universe where everything seems to be going wrong.+The gameplay is fun and simple, and there's a lot of it.+ Hit the jets on the MAKO while driving up a mountain and try to do a backflip!!!- The gameplay can get a little repetitive.- Slightly generic (but forgivable) plotlines, particularly in some side missions.- Ultimately, you're choices don't change the ultimate outcome of the game, but it shows how small you are in this huge story anyway, and serves to drive home that point. (So, secretly a positive?)The negatives are small and are hugely outweighed by the positives.9/10.*Cue opening thematic music***Doooooo dooo doooooooooo doooooo**			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Initial impression:10/10I've held this one aside for too long... ""breathtaking, magnificent and absolutely magnetic in game-play""Time:39h odd for all the secondary content and some serious running in circles. (I found the 'minimum' minerals needed for one assignment, finding more doesn't matter and is never spoken of. otherwise 100%)bad points:Optimisation is very poor, I've turned a lot of the settings down to fix: After an hour or so the game GRINDS TO A HALT and the sounds get chewed up. I'm really not happy with this. (I can run the sequel without problems)This game feels like an ""Elevator Simulator"" ... (please tag product)-I mean SERIOUSLY want to know what it's like to stand in an elevator for 8 or 10 seconds EVERY 2 mins??? ... I've added a user interface command to selectively fast-forward its THAT BAD!The off-roader (MAKO) is pretty twitchy, and uncontrollable like it only wants to point N, NE, E... rather than steer in smooth circles plus it gets thrown about a lot with the exploration (off-world).Exploring other worlds with the Mako is a slow slow frustrating process, again thank goodness for the fast forward.Trying to walk on mountainous terrain: slow, the characters get stuck or simply can't climb anything that looks like a hill, failing that falling through the floor is a serious risk... This has happened rather a lot!There are a few long 'driving' sections which are a complete waste of time/game-play, I think the maps (both off-world and the driving sections) need an overhaul.I think the game moved a little too fast... Shepard seems to overnight gain the keys to the GALAXY... Makes me wonder exactly what did happen on Eden Prime????After 22h.... I'm sadden to say I feel almost ready for the story to wrap up. While the cites are just amazing the exploration off-world has too much obvious ""recycling"" ... It feels like fan-art or a mod!and it just doesn't bloody stop, pointless 'side-mission' after pointless 'side-mission'I few more story missions recouped my enthusiasm for the game, but not a replay yet... but I do have the sequel lined up.Overall I give this game 8.5/10 (recall my non-linear scoring system)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The first of the Mass Effect Trilogy, this one made it's mark by helping pronounce BioWare 'King of RPGs'.Being thee game that started it all, it plays and feels like a 'prototpye' compared to what BioWare games are today- but still carries the immense story-telling to offer. Some would say to skip this game, some would praise it more than it's successors. Either way, I highly encourage playing this game first in order to dive into and enjoy the story-telling that's created and carried thoughout the series.After picking up Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2, I now highly anticipate the 3rd, coming out in March this year.

												The Mass Effect trilogy is one of the best sci-fi game series in recent history, and it all started here. Bioware brings their signature storytelling prowess to an amazing new sci-fi universe, using a third-person shooter combat system. While the combat in the first game leaves a lot to be desired, the epic space opera story and the rich, detailed characters more than make up for it, making this one of my must-play games.

One of the best modern story-driven RPG's I've ever played. I have no complaints about ME1. I loved every minute of my 2 playthroughs. On my 5yr old PC there were no graphic glitches, no lag or issues of any kind. Just smooth sailing graphics & a wonderful story. The characters are well-written, even the ones you don't like (looking at you Ashley). As in KOTOR, you can go Light or Dark, good or bad, making Dialog choices to reflect your own personality or how you want Commander Shepard to be perceived. In this game at least, your choices don't really affect the endgame outcome. Your choices DO open up different dialog options and some side quests. It adds fun flavor to the game.I loved finding all the armor & weps scattered around everywhere you go. I liked the hacking puzzle mini-game to open caches. It reminded me of the similar hydraulic puzzle game in Bioshock, which I also loved - both the main game & the mini puzzle game.The DLC is FreeAnother plus for ME1 is the 2 DLC's are free & easily found to download. Some nice people have already linked them in other helpful reviews, or just Google.Common ComplaintsThe MakoSome people complain about the Mako, which if you haven't played the game yet, is a tank-like vehicle you drive when you explore planets. I personally loved driving the crazy thing. Yes, it can be hard to control. Things can get a little wild, but it's really not that hard & once you get the hang of it, driving it literally anywhere is good fun. Mostly though, combat in the thing with its cannon & gun are a literal blast.ExplorationSome people complained about exploring Planets. I personally enjoyed this aspect as well. You only explore at most, 1 planet per system, & exploring each planet only takes a few minutes. Of course, I did really like driving the Mako so any excuse to get in the thing & go nuts was welcome.Game Won't Start, or get a Black or White Screen then game won't startThis did actually happen to me once, but is VERY simple to fix. Find the game's .exe, right click it and select ""Open as Administrator"". If that doesn't work for you, exit Steam, then Right-click Steam to ""Open As"", THEN rt click ME1's .exe to ""Open As"". You should only ever have to do this once, then done. It happened to me at about 5hours in. I was frustrated for about 10 minutes before I found this simple solution. After that I just started the game normally for the rest of my playtime.Other Similar Games I recommend you play:Dragon Age SeriesMass Effect SeriesKOTOR SeriesBioshock Series - Especially 1, 2 & Minerva's Den DLC (Excellent standalone story there)All of those game titles are equal in my esteem. They all provide good value for the price & all have a great story. These games all really draw you in. IMO you just can't go wrong with any of them.Comments About ME2 & 3(*Included here because many people are buying 1&2 here together)While ME1 had only 2 DLC, both of which are now free, ME2 & ME3 both have numerous expensive DLC that never goes on sale. In fact, you can't just ""buy"" & DL DLC for those 2 games. Nope. Even though you can purchase ME2 on Steam, you have to go to Origin to get the DLC for it.Of course some people needlessly complain about Origin, but truthfully, Origin is awesome. It's a very solid Game Management / Store Interface, just as good as Steam for it's own purposes.Anyway, say you buy the ME1/2 pack here on Steam & you want to then buy DLC for the game, which must be done on Origin (or also on social.bioware.com). ME2/Deluxe does come with a tiny bit of DLC, which you can also activate on Origin along with the base game, should you wish to. Simple steps are needed: Install the game in Steam Right-click ME2 in your Steam library and ""View CD Key"" (The game must be installed to have this option) Open Origin. If you didn't already, create an account & log in. At the top left, click on Origin, then click ""Redeem Product Code"" There are 3 codes for ME2. Copy each from the little Steam window, one at a time, then paste to Activate in the Origin app. Find the game in your Origin Library, hover the mouse over it then click the little italicized ""i"", which opens a more detailed Information page.On the Info page you can see a list of all the DLC, much of which is free. However, the good stuff, namely the Content packs which give you more missions & not just fluff cosmetics, cost money.Actually, they cost ""Bioware Points"". Yes, it's lame, but there's no way around it. BC although Bioware makes insanely awesome games, the guy in charge of setting up the sale of DLC is obviously a crackhead. There's simply no other explanation for why they think this is a good idea, as opposed to just being able to put all the desired DLC in your cart then buying it all straight up.Nope. You put what you want in the cart, then when you Checkout......it takes you to buy Bioware Points. 1600 Points sells for $20, 1200/$15 & 800/$10. It's very simple math to figure out which DLC you really want then convert the dollar value to how many Bioware Points you need. It's really very annoying, but it's not that complicated.You're going to need ~$40 for all the ME2 DLC. More for ME3. So, even though you probably only paid $20 for all 3 games (on sale of course), you're going to probably be forking out $80+ more dollars for any content & cosmetics you may want for ME2 & ME3.One last note. I hear that DLC you buy for ME2 (in Origin of course) can also be activated in your Steam copy of the game, though I don't see the need to do it, so I've never tried. I honeslty don't know why you wouldn't just play it in Origin. But it's said to be possible should you wish to try it.Hope this info was helpful. Enjoy! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What can I say about Mass Effect? It is one of my all-time favorite games. The story is really good and the replay value is high due to the fact that you can create different characters focusing on different abilities. Want to be a soldier with all the toys of destruction or a full biotic with limited weapons, or a technician. You can play a character as these types and some in between.One of the greatest things about the Mass Effect trilogy is that you can import a completed game character into the next installment of the franchise and get bonuses for completing the last installment and pick your character up where you left off. You of course can always just start a new character as well, but it is the carryover of the character that makes the series really unique.The only strikes against it is some of the tedium related to exploring planets and inventory wrangling.Definitely a must buy.

												I've finally got around to beginning the Mass Effect series, and numero uno was a blast. An incredibly immersive, well crafted and believable universe, I found myself happily getting lost in the cultural depth and history created here, of the Geth, Krogan, Turian, Rachni and more. Mass Effect features a wide range of well written, memorable characters (Liara, Wrex, Garrus, Saren, Anderson, Sovereign, could go on), some great clever dialogue and many funny moments, as well as more painful ones as the consequences of your actions play out through the story. One of the best aspects of the game as you progress is simply getting to know your crewmates that you're choosing to work with mission by mission. The music is fantastic, and acts beautifully to create atmosphere and in binding all the various parts of the game together (Vigil, Galaxy Map theme i'm looking at you). For a title released in 2007/2008 the graphics seem to have endured really well, and again fit perfectly with the overall feel of the game. While you're exploring planets be sure to stop and take a few seconds at the summit of a mountain and look out at the vista before you, it's pretty damn gorgeous. Gameplay wise, combat is fun and pretty well balanced, if a little on the easy side. I found biotic abilities particularly enjoyable, there's also a lot of room to customise gear and weapons as you see fit, especially later in the game. Movement is kept varied in space or on land, between exploring new worlds/buildings on foot or by roaming and driving up sheer cliffs in the Mako, hopping around the interior of the Normandy and navigating the Galaxy Map, there is a real and epic sense of scale here (Moon landing included), and the freedom to seek it out.The only slight cons I can think of are somewhat repetitive sidequests; with a bouncy tin tank that has some infamous clunky manoeuvring, and slowpoke elevators (which excellent dialogue and hilarious music almost make up for). The inventory can become a bit tricky to manage. Worlds explored outside of main quests could also be more detailed and fleshed out in terms of content beyond markers on the map. Summary: A brilliant and deeply satisfying narrative experience overall, and I will be coming back for more playthroughs after visiting the next installments of Mass Effect. Just play it.

												I get to traverse the universe on a spaceship with a human character of my own making.  Sign me up!  Sure she's always going to be a goody-two-shoes because being a jerk just seems conterproductive in most cases, and I'm sort of sick of things that tell me if I'm being good or evil instead of actually giving me a hard choice and giving that a consequence, but that's what the second Mass Effect is about right?  Still, this first look into the world as Sheppard is fun, engaging, with a plot that tied together interesting characters for the most part and was a good backbone to the rest of the series.

												The game that started one of the biggest sci-fi adventures in gaming history. It's got everything required to make it a classic; interesting and fun characters with unique cultures,  philospohical questions and moral dilemmas, all wrapped around a well-paced and intriguing story (in my opinion the best in the series). It is a wonderful universe that is really easy to get into, though there are a couple of hurdles that really need to be overcome to get a truly great experience out of this. Throughout a lot of the game, characters will spend a LOT of time explaining things to you, like how cultures work and such.  The story, as I mentioned earlier is great, but the gameplay is not. Combat is fairly clunky, cover system is awkward, every gun feels the same, a lot of enemies are braindead and just run up to you with no regard for their own personal safety. Not exactly the highlight of the game, to put it mildly. The Mako, the vehicle which you use for explo-ration as well as a lot of missions, isn't much better either. It's awkward, handles very poorly and is very boring in use for combat, it's generally used for padding outgame length. Still, it is all in all an amazing game, and gets a 9.1/10 from me.

												Great RPG/FPS with a decent story.  Has the potential for excessive inventory management though, which is one of the good things fixed by the sequels.  I didn't enjoy the vehicle portion, and it seems underdeveloped for what it was.  Too much roaming around a baren landscape looking for resources breaks the storyline and fps action.  The way that the story changes based on your actions, and that it caries over into ME2 and ME3 is genius and I hope more titles take this route.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mass Effect has always been on the top of my ""recommended"" list. I really enjoy single-player RPGs in general, especially those with compelling story lines. Considering how hyped these games are, I had high expectations after I bought the game and sat down to play it. From the get-go, I loved how the game's action was designed with a strong emphasis on gear and squadmates, and a smaller emphasis on combat, which was generally very easy on normal difficulty (and honestly it wasn't that challenging on hard). The decisions, however, were far from easy. I'll avoid spoilers, but Sheperd's decisions can mean life or death for some members of the crew, which you grow attached to throughout the campaign. Mass Effect is all about role-playing and it does it very well. If you don't feel emotionally invested in Sheperd and his crew, you're playing the game wrong. It's not so much the gameplay (which is still pretty good), but the emotion and ability to make the story your own that makes it a really good game. I'll definitely be playing the sequel soon. 8.75/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game sets up a very rich and deep universe with lots of unique dialogue and text (logs) to read which make the game feel a LOT bigger than it actually is. The main story in the sequels might be longer and intense but they don't evoke the feeling of being in a massive universe like this one does.Gameplay wise, it's a bit lacking to be honest - the dialogue choices can be really misleading at times, the combat hasn't aged well and the levels feel a bit sterile or even stale (ex. planetary exploration) at times. Mass Effect 2 might have fixed these issues but at the cost of the more deeper RPG elements of this one.The sense of scale and all the little story elements that are hidden in Mass Effect make it a great game, well worth replaying even a few years after release, even knowing it all amounts to nothing (ME3)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I just finished beating this game, I'm a little late to get into this series I think, but regardless, I bought it and played it.And well I can honestly say I don't regret a dollar or a minute spent on this. This game is just awesome.Where do I start...First of all the game looks pretty good, even if its a bit older. I don't have a computer that can play on the highest settings honestly, but I still found it enjoyable and looked pretty clean to me. Regardless I don't really care that much to be honest ;pOh and the combat is pretty enjoyable I find. Its a shooter type of combat basically, but with a few RPG elements to the combat, I find it quite enjoyable personally, the number of ablities are not overly abundant, but I'm ok with that. I find it doesn't bother me a ton. The combat was also pretty well made so that you, in most cases, can't just go in the middle of the fight, and you actually have to take cover and stuff. It was pretty decently challanging at times and I was playing on the normal difficulty or default one or whatever. Maybe I just suck, idk ;p. But it typically doesn't feel to easy. The part about the game that is arguably the best however is the story, and the interacting with characters, its hard to pick one, but they sort of go hand in hand to an extent.I won't spoil the story to those who haven't played, but I found it very good, it felt like I was watching a movie and I was always curious as to what would happen next, or in the future. As for the interaction with other characters, especially squad members, it is just very interesting. In talking to the different crew members you learn more about them, and sometimes about different species, and you even learn about other background information and their personal thoughts on things. Not to mention sometimes get missions. You can also romance with any squad member of the opposite gender if you so choose ;p. Oh and you can loose squad members(I lost two in my playthrough) which sounds bad, but it only happens through story events. Some are unpreventable to my knowledge, and they lead to some hard choices, which can really play with your emotions and make you feel guilty.Overall the game does a great job of getting you attached(Or to hate) the different characters, and that is just really enjoyable. However the game isn't without its flaws. First of all the game I noticed had a fair number of bugs, some minor, others frusterating, and some making it so I had to reload the game. I only encountered maybe 5 in my whole playthrough, but I think 3 of them involved me falling through the world and having to reload the game, which was frustating at times. There is also a weird black siloute bug that apparently involves AMD processors or something, look it up, I did and apparently others with AMD processors and stuff have similar issues, not unplayable with it, and it only occurs in like two different worlds in the main story, but it can be a bit annoying. Another thing I noticed is that atleast concerning the classes that don't specialize in using the sniper there is no scope, its like a blind fire weapon basically and totally useless. Of course I haven't played anything besides sentinel, so it could be different on them. Frankly the weapons besides the pistol that I had a specialization in on my class where kinda useless I found and I never used any much besides the pistol and sometimes the shotgun, but thats really not that big of a deal, the sniper ones really the biggest issue concerning the weapons. Overall the game is great, it has me hooked after playing through it once, and contemplating playing again, so i'd say its well worth it. I'm going to go after the next games in the series as soon as I can. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This was my first ever dive into the Mass Effect universe and I am mind-blown. The game's excellent mix between RPG and shooter elements makes it a damn worthy one to play. The voice-acting is really good (I played FemShep) and the gameplay/mechanics are very intuitive, I got used to the skills/weapon switching/leveling stuff etc very quickly. Exploring the sidequest planets may have been a tad repetitive after a while, but the main story and background story depth of your squadmates more than make up for this. I am very much looking forward to playing the sequels.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mass Effect is one of the greatest gaming contributions ever made and here is the start of the series. Without giving any spoilers all I can say it's a game that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. For any person who loves Sci Fi I would highly recommend this game. It's probably one of the only games where you actually get to build proper relationships with other characters and that your actions truly define the person you want to be.5/5 truly fantastic game and the other two sequels are on the same scale also ;).

												This is one of my most favorite games ever. I loved every second of it. The characters, the locations. It felt like it had so much depth and it was so much fun to play.There really isn't much else to say other than if you haven't bought it yet, GO DO SO NOW.Verdict: WTF ARE YOU WAITING FOR? BUY IT!

												For a linear game this is one of a kind. Choices effect everything, from who lives and who dies to how your outlook on life, everything changes as you play through the three games. A choice in ME2 could limit a mission in ME3, or a quick snap decision in ME1 could get your charecters killed in ME2. Love intrests, open world missions, and stunning storylines makes these three games a must for any avid gamer.			",196,4,4,27,26,0,52

												Great setting, fantastic visuals, interesting characters and a kickass protagonist (never been a fan of generic mute PC's) brought down by a sub-par roleplaying experience, repetitive ""shoot the enemy until he dies"" combat, bland and uninviting space exploration and generic 'collect em all' sidequests.The story also follows the Bioware plotline formula of 'visit these four different places in any order, then this last place, then you win' which is getting rather tired at this point.That being said, it's a memorable game, and I'll probably have sunk about 100+ hours into it before I'm truly done, thanks to it's replayability. Definately worth it at the price steam is selling it for.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Since this is one of my favorite games, as it should be to many more people as well...Mass Effect combines great third person shooter mechanics with RPG elements that combine to make a great story and overall experience. Choosing what type of charater you want to be and utilizing different powers makes this game extremely replayable. I would recommend for anyone who enjoys an RPG or a 3rd person shooter, as this combination is perfect.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was absolutely amazing. If you haven't already played this, then I am telling you that you need to, NOW. The game is massive, and extremely immersive, even down to the music! Taking on the role of Shepard, you make huge in-game decisions on the spot at times, that will ultimately effect the outcome of your life, your crew, their feelings towards you, the actual story of the game, and even the story of Mass Effect 2! I can not stress to you enough how much I thouroughly enjoyed this game and the amount of content it has. My review will never do it justice, so buy this ♥♥♥♥ing game and enjoy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												PROS:+ Definitely one of the most interesting, yet complex plots out there+ Gameplay is dynamically shaped by your actions and dialogue selections+ Can go around as a total♥♥♥♥♥♥ or an ethical and universal role model+ Epic protagonist+ Fluid game mechanics+ Does a decent job getting your emotions a little worked up+ Viable for replayability+ Most maps are impressively immersive+ AI is actually pretty good+ Different alien species can be fun to learn more about+ Gives the player the option to play strategically with the eccentric specialties of each squad member+ Fun side quests, with some being humorous+ Even after understanding the plot 100%, there are still unresolvable mysteries that leave the players to assume for themselves+ Awesome voice acting, but Shepard's can start to sound monotone after a while+ Textures are a little meh, but are enough to keep you immersed+ Lotsa lens flares+ Optional and unintrusive romanceCONS:- Citadel is large and can be too confusing to navigate through- Too many useless elevators- Walking/jogging speed is kind of slow- Inventory system is really annoying to use- Sound sometimes, but rarely, started acting whacky for me- Exploring (""landing on"") planets that are extraneous to the main plot can sometimes be rewarding, but are mostly ""cookie cutter'ed""- Music is very sci-fi'y, but sometimes annoyed me due to the short loops- Gun model variation is pretty unexciting (maybe 2 models per type, with about 3 colors per model)- No free-roam after completing game, so make sure you do all the side-quests you're interested in and explore BEORE you begin the final quest			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The first thing that comes to mind when I think of Mass Effect is the thoroughness in how well thought out the universe is. The science - what's explained anyway - sounds interesting and plausible (not that I would really know). The concept of labeling any species as ""goodguys"" or ""badguys"" is hard to do since there are handfulls of both good and bad for each one (can't quite call any Hannar ""bad"" but no point nitpicking).The second thing I noticed was the story was really compelling in a way that felt more involving than other games. Think of Mass Effect as a videogame version of a ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" book. The choices you make can affect huge storylines that span the entire series. Sadly giving examples would spoil them. You can even unlock special actions/comments by raising meters gauging your Paragon and Renegade levels. That said almost every single active side quest was pretty repetitive. Go to planet. Drive on planet. Go in only building on planet. Kill a group of people. Collect loot.The combat is fun. How hard it is almost entirely depends on how well you are equipped. If you and your squad aren't equipped then you'll die sometimes. If they're well equipped most missions will typically be manageable on your first attempts. It might have been easier for me being I was an Engineer on my playthrough though - I destroyed shields and overheated weapons and hacked synthetic enemies to control the crowd a bit. I'm eager to try the game again as another class to see how different it would be.The driving parts with the Mako tank sometimes felt out of place. There were a few times it was major fun to drive. The missions involved obviously intended for the tank - like when driving it in the roofs of the ruins of skyscrapers - were awesome. However almost every planet you go to involves dropping onto the surface with the Mako tank before you drive around to check all the marked spots on a map (technically you could ignore them, but this is the most major way to run acrossed large money and some side-mission peices - which also possibly affect things later in the series). A lot of these worlds were mountainous and would make the Mako tank feel pretty mind numbingly slow on the incline.The inventory system was a mess. You could only hold so many items at a time and these items fill up fast on missions - between times you manage to run into a shop to unload them. This means you end up having to mess with it constantly. It's barely sorted in any way and it randomizes the entire list when you equip anything - making it a pain to find what you look for. It at least only shows items that fit in whatever slot you were trying to equip.The graphics were better than I expected them to be for a 10 year old game. Felt like what I usually have them set at for today's games.This game honestly feels like it should be added to some list of ""Games Every Gamer Ought to Play."" It feels like I'm playing a legend. Might have been because I've heard it's good for about 10 years.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A friend of mine, recommond me to play this game. There are choices will have to make in this game. Its all depend on your choices that you will pick. Even though after you complete game, you can always go back and pick another choice! Cool part of it, after you complete this game, it will carry your saved data onto next Mass Effect 2. I think is solid game. However there is one part of this game relate to MAKO....Honest to god...MAKO is really annoying but that only thing is con about this game. Overall is worth buying. If you are fan of Mass Effect. Plus we will be see Mass Effect 4 soon.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Shouldn't be missed if you enjoy Star Wars or sci fi blaster wars.  If you have the rig, make sure to pick up the high res texture pack from somewhere on the nets.  Not really like any other game out there.  I love Star Wars but could never get into Knights of the Old Republic (also made by Bioware I believe).  Perhaps if it had been a squaddie third person shooter I might have...*I cannot comment on other games of the series having not quite completed ME2 and not played ME3 at all, but ME2 while enjoyable, didn't have the charm of the first where you get to know the universe of Mass Effect.  Also ME2 loses some of that RPG feel.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pros:-Story. This isn't surprising. Bioware games tend to be very plot-heavy and less centered on action. More talky-talky bits and extreme decision making. Less shooty-killy.The downside is that while you get a good chunk of the story in the beginning, it doesn't really pick up fully until over halfway through the game.Don't get me wrong. When it picks up, it really picks you up and throws you over the table and repeatedly screws you.-Decisions. Like in Dragon Age, the choices you make do effect the rest of the gameplay and subsequent events. Impacting in the next two games for the trilogy, though I've yet to play 'em.-Action. My first rpg shooter. I like that it wasn't so centered on kill-kill-kill. It allowed me time to get into it, and I'm not big on shooters. This doesn't feel like it's utterly in my face. It's third-person shooter, so I think that helps.-Controls. Very easy to get used to.-Gameplay. Very few timed events. Cons:-Controls. Yes, this is a pro, but in a few cases, it's a con. And it's only a con when you're in a vehicle called the Mako. Mass Effect was a game designed for the console, not the PC. And it shows. Holy hell, does it show.My driving is akin to a drunkard on speed. I managed to flip the damn car over when gravity was on MY side. Every death I suffered was due to that damn car. And you need to use that car a lot. It kills a lot of the fun within the game. Thankfully, it's not essential to the overall game, and if you're not a completionist, you won't have to use it that often.-The 'lockpicking'. It took me forever to figure out wtf I was supposed to do. The game offers you no direction on that. And in decrypting something, the codes are a bit iffy as opposed to how it is for the xbox or PS3. It's a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Once you learn what the hell to do, it's pretty simple. But until you figure it out, it's just banging your head against the wall.-Characters need more by way of development. What was there was definitely touching, and I'm in NO way saying that these characters aren't awesome in their own right. I was touched by a few of their stories. But perhaps I'm spoiled by DA, and Bioware is pretty known for their character development, interactions, etc. -Romances. One male romance for a female main character. One female romance for a male main character. And one female romance for either gender main character.Though I'll give it points for having the bisexual love interest be an alien. Awesome points:-The aliens. Lots of variations, and I really like 'em all. Humans are pretty much on the lower rung here. There are prejudices, other alien races don't much care for humans and humans are the minorities. There's a small group of humans that are all Human Pride sort of thing, but they're largely irrelevant.-The Reapers. I don't want to give any spoilers here, but these are seriously such a badass group of villains. The game made them genuinely scary.-The planets. This probably won't mean much to those who don't care about lore or anything like that, but I found the short summarizations on the different planets to be pretty damn cool and innovative. The Ugly:-The profiles. You cannot make a pretty male Shepherd or a pretty female Shepherd. The textures, lights, shadows, angles will make even the most meticulously done Shepherd fugly. It's highly annoying.-This is one of those games in which it's hard to figure out the first time you play it. Not controls-wise, but everything else-wise. Where to go, what to see, etc. Largely because this world is so big. It's a solar system and it FEELS like a solar system.However, once you've completed one playthrough, you won't really need a guide anymore. It helps that it's a pretty short game. It could probably be played through in the course of a weekend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mass Effect is a great game - some may criticise the combat but I liked it. It's a brilliant example of what an action-RPG should be in terms of interaction and dialogue. There's plenty of background lore to read through, and it's actually quite interesting. The story is also very good, and there are lots of side-quests to pursue as you explore various systems. Unlike other games, there are actual consequences in Mass Effect and your actions can and will decide who lives and who dies.The use of elevators is also a key gameplay mechanic that I find adds a lot to the game.

												What can I say about Mass Effect? It is one of my all-time favorite games. The story is really good and the replay value is high due to the fact that you can create different characters focusing on different abilities. Want to be a soldier with all the toys of destruction or a full biotic with limited weapons, or a technician. You can play a character as these types and some in between.One of the greatest things about the Mass Effect trilogy is that you can import a completed game character into the next installment of the franchise and get bonuses for completing the last installment and pick your character up where you left off. You of course can always just start a new character as well, but it is the carryover of the character that makes the series really unique.The only strikes against it is some of the tedium related to exploring planets and inventory wrangling.Definitely a must buy.

												After 3 years of owning this game I finally buckled down and finished it, and man am i glad i did. I was initally hooked by the tight gameplay. This is a very story focused game so the majority of gameplay is very well designed dialogue trees punctuated by cover shooting. The dialogue trees a very intuitive: options that lead to exposition tend to be on the left and  and story advancing, and affecting choices tend to be on the right. The shooting mechanics are pretty simple, but passably enjoyable with the inclusion of biotic powers to add some stratagy to shake things up a bit.As for the story of the game it is fantastic. The setting is a galactic community very reminicent of Star Wars with engaging intergalactic politics reminicent of the best of Star Trek & Babylon 5. In short an amazing sci-fi universe. What i like most in a story is the characters, and Mass Effect has some fantastic characters. My favorites being Liara, Garrus, Wrex, Joker, Captain Anderson, Tali'Zora, and of course Wrex. You may have noticed I just listed most of the potental party members and some of the side characters that is how likable and well written Mass Effect's characters are.Long story short if you are at all a fan of RPGs (this is one of the best i felt fully immersed in the role I was playing), Sci-Fi (the game's universe is the perfect amalgamation of the best of popular Sci-Fi), or even simply great storytelling: Mass Effect comes highly reccommended from me.

												Let me start off by saying this game is not worth getting if you are not willing to buy the whole trilogy, and sit through a generally clunkey combat system in the first game. By itself I would not recomend this game enless you are willing  to buy the trilogy. Despite the annoyances EA Origin might bring. It is probably a better idea to buy the trilogy from there or other retailers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Admittedly, when I started playing this game, I didn't have high hopes for it. In a wide galaxy, you play as a human named Shepard, who saves the galaxy and either makes everyone feel bad about how awful they are, or punches everyone in the face. Either way, it's a win/win situation.It's region based open world, which means a lot of the time you will be running around the map trying to find a fast travel spot, but that's the fun part. You get to see a LOT of planets, drive a Mako (probably flip it and be unable to get up a mountain with it), and have aliens join your entourage. As the first game in the franchise, the graphics leave a little to be desired, but it makes up for that with it's combat, storyline, and heartbreaking decisions.All in all, Mass Effect is one of my favorite games, and it's always nice to return to the foundation of the series and make a new Shepard, new choices, and find a new love interest.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mass Effect is not a sandbox/open-world RPG.  This game is not about shooting things because you can.  This game, is above that.  This game plays a psychological role in your life, depending on whether you allow it to or not.  If it is to be held as an open-world RPG, let the world be the minds of each person you meet, whether for the first time or the last.  Personally, I believe this is more of an RPG than TES or Fallout, as the role you play shows an impact on the world around you, and the decisions you make can decide whether or not you live as a role-model of humanity or a menace that holds importance.

												Great game. Great universe. Above all, I applaud the dialogue wheel options. Questions I was asking myself were listed which made conversations feel natural, and and the game didn't use Charm or Intimidate skill to resolve most of its story. I'm usually set on what choices my character would make in an RPG, but I actually took a step back a few times to think of the consequences of my actions. Really makes me want to play the game a few more times to see how other choices will affect the game.I'm not a huge fan of dynamic leveling in games especially RPGs where progression matters, but I wish they had added it to this game. When they offer you a universe to quest through it's very easy to make mistakes. One of your first quest options when you get your ship is to find Liara between several planets in a system. The first planet I searched ended up being for level 30's while I was only level 8. I kept dying and I thought I was playing the game wrong because I was new and it took almost two hours to finish it before I found out it was a separate optional quest. Romances felt forced. It seemed as if BioWare tried to use romance as a selling point of the game or something. Although it's kinda acceptable with the way your character interacts with everyone but it was still too blunt. I talked to Ashley once about her history and suddenly she's fighting with Liara over who I love more. It only happened because Ashley herself told me to talk to Liara after her mother dies and Liara suddenly falls in love with me. It seemed unnecessary.Other than those small grievances, the game was great and I'm looking forward to playing the 2nd and 3rd games. Amazed it took me this long to play it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An excellent game that has a story heavily influenced by Star Trek and Star Wars. The gameplay and story are compelling, although I do think that the oft-binary choices between good and evil hurt the game. Trust me here, it's much more entertaining to watch Shepard be a total jerk (and, occasionally, commit genocide) than it is to make him a goody-two shoes. I'll go ahead and say that I enjoyed this game the most out of the series (though I have not yet played 3), as I thought that the overall story was focused and quite exciting-- well worth playing to the finish.

												Great game. If you like RPGs, then you'll love this game. I only played ME3 before I played any other Mass Effect games, and this one has proved why its a must have in only 8 hours of play. Pros:-Runs well on my system (i5 3570k GTX 770) its a 6 year old game so I think I'd be right to assume that it should rune fine on most systems -has extensive dialogue options -Interesting plot-Good graphics for the time-Characters are interesting-The ambiance of locations really make the game feel alive! For example, the Citadel. -The gameplay is fun, and not very conky-I find that the cover system is a lot more advanced than the ones that are offered in other AAA games released today, its pretty adaptive. Cons: -The inventory system isn't all that great-Sometimes there's a bit of screen tearing -If you don't like RPGs and don't really care much about lore and are looking for an fps, then this game won't really stand out for you. Overall, its a great game, and it never hurts to pick it up on a sale and try it. You will most probably enjoy it! 9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When I first heard about Mass Effect, I was quite skeptical on how good it could really be. It is with great honor that I deem my previous thoughts unworthy. Mass Effect is the first of a trilogy, and it holds the rank as being one of the greats. However, tedious inventory management, dated graphics, and planet exploration on a space car that handles badly, are some of the downsides, but put those aside, and there is a great story with great characters awaiting. The story begins with Commander Shepard going on a mission to be tested to be a Spectre, but things go awry, as repected Spectre Saren goes rogue, and things don't go according to plan. Now Shepard must save the galaxy from Saren and his synthetic partners from an ancient evil altogether. Characters are varied, with humans mixed along with some aliens in Commander Shepard's squad. Weapons and armor are numerous, with also mods to put on the armor and weapons. All in all, a great sci-fi RPG that has to be played.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've always been a fan of the old-school manu based combat RPGs; such that were developed for consoles, the old jRPG. I was very nervous getting Mass Effect, ""a shooter game"", worried that it would be dumbed down too much for me to enjoy. I was wrong. Mass Effect is a great game that any RPG ""must have"".

												An excellent game that has a story heavily influenced by Star Trek and Star Wars. The gameplay and story are compelling, although I do think that the oft-binary choices between good and evil hurt the game. Trust me here, it's much more entertaining to watch Shepard be a total jerk (and, occasionally, commit genocide) than it is to make him a goody-two shoes. I'll go ahead and say that I enjoyed this game the most out of the series (though I have not yet played 3), as I thought that the overall story was focused and quite exciting-- well worth playing to the finish.

												An amazing sci-fi space opera set in a very deep and colorful universe.  There are shooter elements, but this is primarily an RPG.  If you beat the game you can load your save file into the sequel, Mass Effect 2 (which is more shooter than RPG, unfortunately).  I highly recommend picking this game up, as well as ME2, so you can play though the epic storyline and be ready for the third and final entry in the series at the end of the year.One of my favorite RPG games.

												The Game's Trilogy is such a wonderful experience, but this game is probably not the best out of the the three. The controls suck, the film grain is disturbing and ugly, but what this game lacks in that, is story. Oh my god, the story, choices, characters, lore, and super OP Weapons near the end of the game are what make this game great.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The first two times I played this game, it was on the lowly XBox 360.  The game was already very dated five years ago, or so it seemed.  My third playthrough, and my first on the PC, and I'm seeing stunning visuals and textures that were simply not present on the console version.  The game looks worlds better than I remember.  Controls are better (except for the vehicle), and it helps to have a deep understanding of game mechanics from playing all three multiple times through.  My first playthrough of this game was frustratingly difficult because I didn't understand what type of character I had picked or how to properly use the powers.  I suggest a revisit to this game for anyone who liked this series.  Tip:  If anyone's having trouble running this game, or using Steam overlay while playing, close Steam, and reopen it as Administrator.  The games will inherit the permissions, and everything will work fine. Tip 2:  For anyone having trouble with resolution settings, dig into the Steam game folder for Mass Effect.  There's a launcher in there that lets you change settings, including increasing resolution (for me, 2560 x 1600, but anything 16:10 will need to be set via this launcher to look correct, because the game will only show 16:9 resolutions while looking at in-game settings.)

												A friend of mine, recommond me to play this game. There are choices will have to make in this game. Its all depend on your choices that you will pick. Even though after you complete game, you can always go back and pick another choice! Cool part of it, after you complete this game, it will carry your saved data onto next Mass Effect 2. I think is solid game. However there is one part of this game relate to MAKO....Honest to god...MAKO is really annoying but that only thing is con about this game. Overall is worth buying. If you are fan of Mass Effect. Plus we will be see Mass Effect 4 soon.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am writing this before I played ME2/3 and hence don't know how the story continues. So here's the thing: I love RP, I don't mind shooters, I frikkin love scifi. This was my first ever dive into the Mass Effect universe and I am mind-blown. The game's excellent mix between RPG and shooter elements makes it a damn worthy one to play. The voice-acting is really good (I played FemShep) and the gameplay/mechanics are very intuitive, I got used to the skills/weapon switching/leveling stuff etc very quickly. Exploring the sidequest planets may have been a tad repetitive after a while, but the main story and background story depth of your squadmates more than make up for this. I am very much looking forward to playing the sequels.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I totally ignored Mass Effect since the moment it appeared. But then I decided to give the series a try so I bought it on sale. I must say that this is one of the best things I have ever played. Definitely one of the best RPGs. Despite the fact it is a 7 year old game, it still looks great and has a very good gameplay. The most interesting thing is the vast set of possibilities that you have to complete every single mission. Every single choice you make will have repercussions. Another innovating aspect is the dialogue because it is very cinematic. It's old but better than many recent titles.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I just finished beating this game, I'm a little late to get into this series I think, but regardless, I bought it and played it.And well I can honestly say I don't regret a dollar or a minute spent on this. This game is just awesome.Where do I start...First of all the game looks pretty good, even if its a bit older. I don't have a computer that can play on the highest settings honestly, but I still found it enjoyable and looked pretty clean to me. Regardless I don't really care that much to be honest ;pOh and the combat is pretty enjoyable I find. Its a shooter type of combat basically, but with a few RPG elements to the combat, I find it quite enjoyable personally, the number of ablities are not overly abundant, but I'm ok with that. I find it doesn't bother me a ton. The combat was also pretty well made so that you, in most cases, can't just go in the middle of the fight, and you actually have to take cover and stuff. It was pretty decently challanging at times and I was playing on the normal difficulty or default one or whatever. Maybe I just suck, idk ;p. But it typically doesn't feel to easy. The part about the game that is arguably the best however is the story, and the interacting with characters, its hard to pick one, but they sort of go hand in hand to an extent.I won't spoil the story to those who haven't played, but I found it very good, it felt like I was watching a movie and I was always curious as to what would happen next, or in the future. As for the interaction with other characters, especially squad members, it is just very interesting. In talking to the different crew members you learn more about them, and sometimes about different species, and you even learn about other background information and their personal thoughts on things. Not to mention sometimes get missions. You can also romance with any squad member of the opposite gender if you so choose ;p. Oh and you can loose squad members(I lost two in my playthrough) which sounds bad, but it only happens through story events. Some are unpreventable to my knowledge, and they lead to some hard choices, which can really play with your emotions and make you feel guilty.Overall the game does a great job of getting you attached(Or to hate) the different characters, and that is just really enjoyable. However the game isn't without its flaws. First of all the game I noticed had a fair number of bugs, some minor, others frusterating, and some making it so I had to reload the game. I only encountered maybe 5 in my whole playthrough, but I think 3 of them involved me falling through the world and having to reload the game, which was frustating at times. There is also a weird black siloute bug that apparently involves AMD processors or something, look it up, I did and apparently others with AMD processors and stuff have similar issues, not unplayable with it, and it only occurs in like two different worlds in the main story, but it can be a bit annoying. Another thing I noticed is that atleast concerning the classes that don't specialize in using the sniper there is no scope, its like a blind fire weapon basically and totally useless. Of course I haven't played anything besides sentinel, so it could be different on them. Frankly the weapons besides the pistol that I had a specialization in on my class where kinda useless I found and I never used any much besides the pistol and sometimes the shotgun, but thats really not that big of a deal, the sniper ones really the biggest issue concerning the weapons. Overall the game is great, it has me hooked after playing through it once, and contemplating playing again, so i'd say its well worth it. I'm going to go after the next games in the series as soon as I can. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Mass Effect series is probably the greatest executed RPG trilogy ever created, and my personal favorite three video games ever made so far. The first game stands as one of the best. I've played this game more than any other video game I've ever had, I used to own the disc copy when it first came out, and I even owned it on PS3, before getting it again on Steam. This game has been out for 9 years and every year or two I find myself getting bored of current games and coming back to this series, and it has never gotten old. Especially not the first one!

												After bunches of strangers posted to me about Mass Effect, I finally gave it a go. Space-themed game with focus on story? Sounds right up my alley.Right away, I need to criticize the main city of the game, the Citadel. Who in the world designed this mess? I'm not saying it's fugly. In fact, it looks quite nice. It's just that it's poorly laid out and needlessly labyrinthine... especially for a main hub of the game.The shooter aspect was okay. I'm not really a first or third person shooter type, but it worked, and it was playable, so I'll leave it at that.I'm still not exactly sure what the point of scanning planets for resources was. It was hardly crucial to the plot or gameplay. Just a pure homage to Star Control?Replay value is... there. I admit I would have liked to go back and earn some achievements that provide rewards, but the gameplay just wasn't enticing enough to me to warrant a second playthrough. I need to note that playing as a Paragon is boring as hell. I recommend trying out a Renegade to bring out the more interesting conversations.The game has excellent atmosphere, and some pretty interesting alien backstory. I don't quite understand the trend of cramming in bucketloads of irrelevant information in the in-game encyclopedia, but I guess there's an audience for it. The strength of the game I feel is in the character conversations, but those weren't as frequent as I would have liked.Overall I'd have to say I wasn't disappointed. I wasn't blown away by the plot, though that's my fault for setting a high expectation. The main story isn't the kind of story that makes you a better person for having experienced it, but it was interesting nonetheless, especially towards the end. Still not Planescape: Torment caliber. 8.5/10			",535,252,19,112,46,6,135

												If you haven't already purchased this game, you should go and purchase it right now.  Why? Well there's plenty of reasons. Mass Effect is the beginning to the phenomenal trilogy that revolutionized what it means to give a player choice.  In this game you are Shepard, a Commander in the Alliance Navy. Essentially you learn that the rogue Spectre, the galaxy's highest ranking police essentially, Saren is attempting to bring back the ancient machine race known as the Reapers. While tracking Saren down, Shepard meets many valuable teammates, and loses them, based on how you play.The dialogue in this game is centered mostly around a wheel with several parts, each having different types of dialogue choices. Want to attempt to save all the survivors of an attack? Sure. Want to punch the ♥♥♥♥♥y news-reporter in her face? Feel free, it's your choice. Choices, which do carry on the sequels, mind you. While the story and dialogue in the first game entice you to finish it, I do have to admit that the combat is not the best. It's pretty bad, but not too bad that it makes it unbearable to play. But don't worry, the problem is solved in the next game so don't lose hope. There are also a few bugs in the game that annoy you sometimes and also a few graphical errors, but nothing that will keep you from enjoying the masterpiece that is Mass Effect.On a scale of 1 to 10, I would gives Mass Effect a 9.2.

												It is hard to say just how much I love this game (and ME2) This game has everything you could want in an RPG, great story, great people that you come to care about in a small way. The only downside I can think of, is that in order to complete every possible thing you can, you do A LOT of ""Moon Patrol"" type play. Driving a vehicle on alien planets that are pretty much just bare and offer only small changes from the last naked alien planet you were driving on. You can however complete the game without doing EVERY part, and thus can avoid much of this.The best part of this game is how you can import your character into ME2 and the choices you made have an effect on what happens.My suggestion, if you can, is to start up ME2, and make your toon there first (face) get a code and THEN make it in ME1. Otherwise you import your toon and do not get a code, forcing you to start over making a face. Bad if you get attached to your Shepard, which happens easily.I suggest playing as a female Shepard, no, not (just) because of eye candy, but because I honestly feel that the female voice acting is better, and somehow the Shepard character makes more sense as a woman. Plus when you choose the renegade (badass) options, rather than the goodygoody options, it just makes them sound 100% cooler comming from a woman ^_^.			",96,7,1,29,11,0,15

												Great game. Great universe. Above all, I applaud the dialogue wheel options. Questions I was asking myself were listed which made conversations feel natural, and and the game didn't use Charm or Intimidate skill to resolve most of its story. I'm usually set on what choices my character would make in an RPG, but I actually took a step back a few times to think of the consequences of my actions. Really makes me want to play the game a few more times to see how other choices will affect the game.I'm not a huge fan of dynamic leveling in games especially RPGs where progression matters, but I wish they had added it to this game. When they offer you a universe to quest through it's very easy to make mistakes. One of your first quest options when you get your ship is to find Liara between several planets in a system. The first planet I searched ended up being for level 30's while I was only level 8. I kept dying and I thought I was playing the game wrong because I was new and it took almost two hours to finish it before I found out it was a separate optional quest. Romances felt forced. It seemed as if BioWare tried to use romance as a selling point of the game or something. Although it's kinda acceptable with the way your character interacts with everyone but it was still too blunt. I talked to Ashley once about her history and suddenly she's fighting with Liara over who I love more. It only happened because Ashley herself told me to talk to Liara after her mother dies and Liara suddenly falls in love with me. It seemed unnecessary.Other than those small grievances, the game was great and I'm looking forward to playing the 2nd and 3rd games. Amazed it took me this long to play it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mass Effect is a story-rich FPS where you play as Shepard, in a time where the universe is starting to realise the potential of the human species in taking up bigger responsibilities alongside others. Initially under Captain Anderson's command, you are tasked to investigate a distress signal on a planet and during which, you discover that a trusted ally is setting something shady into motion. Throughout the game. you hunt him down and discover the secrets that would have implications on everyone in the known universe.The game focuses strongly on the story, during which you would have to make a number of decisions that although may not change the story itself, they translate to your character stats, and also the (remaining) crew that you fight with. (And also your sex life lmao.) The combat system is pretty good in that you fight in a section of 3, where your crew could provide interesting powers or just be meat shields as you recharge your own powerups. However, some hostiles such as snipers or rocket turrets could possibly one-shot Shepard and you would have to restart from where the game last saved. Hence, I do recommend that you consistently manual save or you might have to replay a large part of the mission.I find the game very well-rounded and enjoyable, back by an interesting story. However, one major set back to the action for me would be the extremely long elevator rides. Seems silly but you would have to play it to understand the agony :)9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												590 hours.  Thats 24 unblinking, unsleeping days with the crew of the Normandy.According to the combined statistics of Steam, and Origin. Over a hundred fourty hours went into the original Mass Effect (four playthroughs), 289 hours into Mass Effect 2 (six playthroughs), and 219 hours into Mass Effect 3 (two compleate playthroughs, many incompleate) and 8 hours into ME4 Andromeda.Commander Shepard and her crew(no one should play as male Shep imho), have done plenty of galaxy saving, and stirring up,  under my control. They fought, robots, clones, politicians, and reporters. They made love to aliens, hate to aliens, and even saved a race from going compleatly extinct!  We laughed, cried, got wasted, and most importantly fought beside one another through thick and thin.They're my friends.OK, they're not really my friends; claiming to be buddies with imaginary characters is a little too geeky even for me. The Mass Effect series is not without its flaws, and some are truly Reaper-sized. But it has gripped me like nothing else in the history of video games, and video games and I go back a pretty long way (but I'll never betoo old for video games)!The Mass Effect universe is that rare thing—a fully-realized science fiction game setting that stands up to the likes of Star Trek or Star Wars. The universe in which the games take place has a rich and complex backstory, and even better, it's not a rich and complex back story that the player has to have info-dumped into his head. This isn't The Old Republic, where you have to read thousands of awful Kevin J. Anderson ""Extended Universe"" novels and have a working knowledge of the seven prime forms of lightsaber combat to get the most out of the game.There's depth in the backstory, but it's not the kind of depth that ever compelled me to memorize the game's codex entries. (Do you really need to know that the ""First Contact War"" between humans and Turians started because humans activated a mass relay in violation of council law and that the war culminated in the siege of Shanxi? No. It's wonderful flavor, but it's not mandatory knowledge.) The world is alive and compellingly real just through dialogue and character actions, without needing endless narration. The first game's opening title crawl essentially says, ""This is the future and aliens are real and you are a space soldier. Go."" That's enough.Instead of a galactic civics lesson, Mass Effect focuses on a human, the forever-first-nameless Commander Shepard, and her fight against the ancient Reapers, an enemy that aims to rid the galaxy of advanced sentient life for a whole bunch of really complicated reasons. That fight is the central focus of all three games, though Shepard's path from soldier to savior twists and turns and doubles back on itself like a demented snake.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of those games that people seem to either love or just like.  I have never found anyone who hated it.  I am firmly in the ""love"" category.  One of those singleplayer experiences that you will remember forever.  Also, another one of the rare games that I find myself coming back to over and over again.  Like Deus Ex, it is basically a shooter with RPG elements (a TPS instead of an FPS).  Also like Deus Ex, you will find that there are often choices that you face in campaign that will change the gameplay and direction of the rest of the game.  Mass Effect has a perfect balance of choice, action, customizing, freedom, and intrigue to keep you coming back over and over again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mass Effect is an amazing game.I first played it years ago when I was a young teenager,  when it was the only ME game out there and it shaped what I expected of gaming from then on. Everything from the atmosphere of the game (the music in particular is something to behold) to the narrative and how it plays out all feels well thought-out and engaging. Some of the plot and side-missions feel like they're plucked from generic sci-fi plotlines and remuddled a bit, but in ME's own way, it owns those factors and you no longer think ""That whole alien queen speaking telepathically to someone has been done before"" and rather think ""Mass Effect did it and did it well."" Your rampage across the galaxy to find this villain who's become a harbinger for the end of life as we know it is fun, and you care about it. Is it the same as every other game where you chase a world-ending villain and his/her catastrophes? Yep. Still fun.While, at this point, the graphics are a little outdated, you occasionally see something jaw dropping in Mass Effect. Smoke drifting diagonally away from lava-coated vistas (that you're DRIVING THROUGH) or a blinding, lilac sun on an alien horizon can, once-in-a-while, take your breath away.The dialogue is meticulously thought-out and well acted (while sometimes sounding a LITTLE dry) and it makes for a great dialogue-system where you know what you choose to say can and will have an effect on the outcome of a mission. It's one of the first games I played that implemented this. Although, while you have choices in ME, all those anastamosing plotlines end you up in the same place. That's not a downside (insert a philosophical quote about inevitability and fate here.) You still feel in control of your character and your future though and that's as much as you can ask for in a game.Gameplay-wise, it's fun, if a little simple. There aren't any puzzling moments (unless you count getting temporarily lost in one of the many hubs.) The game repeats a little when you have to play the same fight a few times to win. That's not a criticism. I'm all for old-school, 'git good' gaming.There are really only three or four main things you'll be doing in this game; shooting at and ducking from a wide variety of clever(ish) enemies, wandering around hub areas looking for answers to life's questions (and convincing people to do things), driving around in the MAKO (amazingly fun for something so simple) to explore planets, and zipping around the galaxy map to go do one of the three aforementioned activities.The combat is FUN and simple, but your two AI counterparts are fairly stupid and don't like to use cover like you do, so will get shot ALOT. Ordering them about feels like you're having to baby two other people whilst not dying in a firefight yourself, but you're Commander Shepherd. You can do it.Wandering back and forth in hub worlds like the Citadel is fun for about five minutes as it's all rather pretty, but eventually, talking to one character then running back to talk to another can get a bit boring and you wind up wanting to leap into some action again, which you can't without finishing your conversational wanderings. And prepare for ALOT of elevators. It's M.E.'s way of loading parts of maps while you're travelling but it takes you out of things a bit and they make you use elevators a whole lot. Boring, sadly.Planet exploring is fun and scenic (did I mention this game is beautiful?) especially in the MAKO. The vehicle is fun to drive around, even if it does have some crazy oversteer, but what do you expect when you're on the surface of some low-G moon driving over dunes and dustscapes? The guns feel powerful but don't bother trying to shoot anything near you as the thing can't aim down and the MAKO is quite tall. Just run over the enemies, dammit.They've put so much effort into fleshing out the characters and histories in this game; of you, your squad mates and beyond and it's all well voice acted. You can feel sparks fly not only between you and your teammates, but you notice which squadmates like each other and where rivalries lie in all the tiny ways. And everybody has their flaws. I love Ashley. No denying it there. I love her go-gettem attitude and her out of nowhere attraction to poetry. But she's also super racist against aliens, although she denies it. These aren't character tropes that come out of nowhere. Ashley's lived a life before you knew her and she's willing to tell you about it if you get to know her, from her gung-ho attitude she cultivated with her sister, to her father's love of poetry handed down to her, to her stoic patriotism towards Earth and Humanity leading to her distrust of alien races. Like her or not, she's human (irony intended); so much more than just a 3D rendered cardboard cutout. Now apply that detail to the dozens of characters, locations and races in Mass Effect. (All except Saren, the main villain of the game, who seems to just be a laughing, evil face with no deep backstory other than a foreboding 'he used to be what you are now.') They've sat down and thought this universe out. We NEED more people to do this when making games. It's probably the biggest selling point of Mass Effect. The galaxy has existed long before you arrived and will go on long after you leave (until ME3 maybe). You can ignore all of it; skip past the expositional dialogue or ignore informative text boxes altogether. But if you want the lore, it's all there and it's beautiful. Plus, they make a GOOD attempt at sciencing everything well. It's what makes for 'science-fiction' rather than 'space-fantasy.'So, to sum up:+This game is STILL beautiful after all these years.+The people and locations are so detailed in lore and history that you can't help but love them all. +You feel in control of yourself in a vast universe where everything seems to be going wrong.+The gameplay is fun and simple, and there's a lot of it.+ Hit the jets on the MAKO while driving up a mountain and try to do a backflip!!!- The gameplay can get a little repetitive.- Slightly generic (but forgivable) plotlines, particularly in some side missions.- Ultimately, you're choices don't change the ultimate outcome of the game, but it shows how small you are in this huge story anyway, and serves to drive home that point. (So, secretly a positive?)The negatives are small and are hugely outweighed by the positives.9/10.*Cue opening thematic music***Doooooo dooo doooooooooo doooooo**			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												OK! Seriously, you should get this phenomonal game, it's WELL worth the price tag of $20! It's a 3rd person shooter which features fleshed out characters and long cinematic cutscenes, superbly intertwined to form a vast universe of which no other game has come closer to creating. Its an RPG which means levelling-up, but there's no need to level grind in any area of the game, as levels get you added bonuses which may give you a slight edge. There is also a customisable weapons feature, where you can modify rounds and parts of your guns.Absolutely perfect, except for the driving sequences (which are few and far between), in which you control a car that handles 'like a fat kid on a unicycle'.9.9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I fought off the advances of a blue alien girl, while breaking rules and regulations and sleeping with a subordinate space marine. I then sacrificed a whiney space mage, along with an alien council to save human lives. I then bro-fisted my alien cop buddy during my adventures throughout the galaxy.(The original is much more RPG than the sequels. Expect inventory management to be an utter nightmare with all the useless crap you pick up. Much better characters than Dragon Age. Driving parts aren't THAT bad. Elevator parts are. If you can stick it out past the citadel, its a very fun game/series, and imho Bioware's finest. Suck it KOTOR.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mass Effect is a great game - some may criticise the combat but I liked it. It's a brilliant example of what an action-RPG should be in terms of interaction and dialogue. There's plenty of background lore to read through, and it's actually quite interesting. The story is also very good, and there are lots of side-quests to pursue as you explore various systems. Unlike other games, there are actual consequences in Mass Effect and your actions can and will decide who lives and who dies.The use of elevators is also a key gameplay mechanic that I find adds a lot to the game.

												Mass Effect is one of the greatest gaming contributions ever made and here is the start of the series. Without giving any spoilers all I can say it's a game that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. For any person who loves Sci Fi I would highly recommend this game. It's probably one of the only games where you actually get to build proper relationships with other characters and that your actions truly define the person you want to be.5/5 truly fantastic game and the other two sequels are on the same scale also ;).

I think the second one would be better if you are just looking for some action ad better gameplay. over all story = amazing but gameplay = meh, comparing it to the second Mass effect.

Posted: March 21, 2014
												So I found Mass Effect on a Steam Sale back in 2013, and purchased it for hardly anything. I'd not read any reviews on the game, so had no idea what to expect once I bought it. I guess, truth be told, I only bought it because it was so cheap and I hoped it could fill a few hours one boring evening after work. Oh, sweet Mass Effect, you didn't disappoint! There aren't many games that I genuinely wish I could remove from my memory, in order to replay again with a fresh set of eyes, but the exceptional story of Mass Effect, combined with the excellent character acting, life and death decisions that you'll face, and Shepherd's development and rise from traumatised soldier to first human Spectre, is a real work of genius. Despite this game being made in 2008 (I think), I only started playing it in March 2014. In total, I've spent around 43 blissfully happy hours running through the main story and side quests (excluding those pesky 'collect so many of this type of tag' quests). I know many games don't age well, but Mass Effect doesn't look old, nor dated, and if I didn't know the age of this game, I'd quite truthfully believe it was new and current.I'll close by saying that anyone not already familiar with Mass Effect should buy it immediately - well, if you like story driven games, of course. If not, just wait for a Steam Sale and buy it when it's virtually free!Now, enough singing the praises of Mass Effect - I was also fortunate enough to buy Mass Effect 2 in the same sale. I just hope it lives up to my lofty expectations and doesn't lose the excitement built from this true classic!			",139,12,3,14,49,0,45

Posted: January 4
												So after all these years of hearing the hype I couldn't curb my curiosity any longer and finally bought Mass Effect and its sequel during the last christmas sales. As of now I've played about three quarters of Mass Effect and though I initially liked it I have to say I'm getting bored with it. Though that may sound negative I still give it a 3 out of 5 because it's a competent game but in my oppinion it doesn't deserve the praise it's getting.If you're familiar with Biowares previous products like Jade Empire and especially Knights Of The Old Republic (KOTOR)  you pretty much know what to expect from Mass Effect. Personally I think Mass Effect was probably meant to be another KOTOR installment, because its entire world could have been replaced with the one from KOTOR without much change, the Jedi order is now Spectre, the Jedi counsil is now The Counsil, the Force powers are now Biotic powers, the Twileks are now Asari, the Mandalorians are now Krogans and the list goes on. Maybe they couldn't secure the Star Wars license, not that it matters (unless you still care about Star Wars) because Bioware did a desent job in creating this new backdrop.Still I think this game shows why Bioware is becoming lazy as it's yet another save the universe story, which is way to similar to KOTOR. Like in Biowares earlier mentioned games, new partymembers join with no effort and are immediately willing to die for the cause. This is not only a missed opportunity for having better sidequests, it also makes their motives in joining meaningless. Mass Effect has some of the worst sidequests I've witnessed, the game has you looking for minerals with your APC by searching entire maps, to laughable moral decissions like wether a (completely bystanding) pregnant woman should have her baby inspected, which really made me question myself what I'm doing with my life by playing Mass Effect. For god's sake, Bioware please don't try to forcefeed me with morally responsible gameplay because you are terrible at it!As for the combat, the enemies are ridiculous bulletsponges which makes your weapons feel completely ineffective, I know this is in a lot of games but when I shoot something I expect it to hurt! As for me I was a bulletsponge too, so I didn't bother to make use of the coversystem much and I played on hard level. The shotgun and the assault rifle were the only usable weapons. I didn't see why I needed the pistol as drawing to a different weapon took as long as your gun to cool down and using the sniperrifle was like a drunk man playing darts. Another extremely annoying thing is that you have to have a high techlevel to be able to open all the containers, which in the end made me play only with Tali and Garrus as teammembers. I also thought that Mass Effect had rather poor graphics even for 2008, the characters have latexfaces, the leveldesign is rather bland and textures are very lowres, on the other hand I did like the music.So if you haven't played KOTOR or Jade Empire you might like Mass Effect more than me, if you have already played those you'll probably gonna need something to keep you awake while playing this game.

												I totally ignored Mass Effect since the moment it appeared. But then I decided to give the series a try so I bought it on sale. I must say that this is one of the best things I have ever played. Definitely one of the best RPGs. Despite the fact it is a 7 year old game, it still looks great and has a very good gameplay. The most interesting thing is the vast set of possibilities that you have to complete every single mission. Every single choice you make will have repercussions. Another innovating aspect is the dialogue because it is very cinematic. It's old but better than many recent titles.10/10			",27,2,0,3,1,0,2

												So I bought this game about a year ago and just couldn't get into it, but I gave it another chance and I'm glad I did. Mass Effect is a fantastic game that I didn't want to end. The desire to hear new and intriguing dialogue is what kept me immersed is this experience. The combat is medicore and I found the inventory system horrendous, but I just kept wondering what would happen next. The story is just something you have to experience and the choices you get to make are very interesting. I found that a ton of choices made in this game carry over to Mass Effect 2, which is great! 9/10.			",152,13,4,27,13,3,9

												Hours are a lie (Were not recorded during offline for some reason). The main story took me around 12 or so hours to complete and I got to say that was one good half of a day. This is the first time I had ever played a mass effect game and with so much talk about how the 3rd ones ending wasn't good I didn't know what to expect, but what I did find was an extremely vast world full of spectacular different species and enviornments as well as a rich and well told narrative following the adventures of Commander Shepard and his crew. I would say the game is nearly perfect but its age has diffently shown. Gunplay seems fairly weak as a result of lack of feedback (imo) and the game is riddled with texture bugs, audio bugs and the occasional screen tear. If these bugs and faults can be put aside, then you will surely be in for one wild ride! ",103,6,0,18,4,1,2

												I played Mass Effect twice, once with a female engineer Shepard and once with a male vanguard Shepard. If you like the Dragon Age series and you don't mind a more shooter-like style of fighting, this is the game for you. But even if you're not familiar with it, this game is a lot of fun for everyone I would say.The character development and the decisions (good/evil) make things interesting and all the different companions really add to the storyline. The vehicle (Mako) is an absolute nightmare but you kinda get used to it and I even spoke of it fondly by the end of the game.The planets and views in this game are absolutely stunning, even if you don't have the best graphics (like me). I started Mass Effect 2 now because I loved this game so much.			",18,6,0,6,1,0,1

												What do you do when you're the only one who can save the galaxy? And the name of the main quest is called ""A Race Against Time""?1. You take your time and explore the galaxy trying to find all the minerals, Turian insignias and Asari writings while not paying attention to what the bad guy is doing.2. You run out on inventory space 30 minutes into the game.3. You sell all of your unnecessary equipment and buy better equipment only to realise you're current equipment is better than what you just bought.4. You go to a planet that has a perma-blizzard and ride through it like a badass and end up killing everything in your way.5.  You flirt with your crew members (of opposite gender) and then bang them near the end6. You realise why Commander Shepard is one of the most badasss characters in gaming history.7. You get people to commit suicide by just speaking to them and they say thank you...8. Your very word can stop an argument.9. You kill the bad guy while looking badass...what did you expect..its a typical Bioware game..10. You repeat this whole process because you love the story so much!In all seriousness this game is amazing, even though I stopped playing it for a while because I didn't have much time on my hands, I've actually played this game 10 times on Xbox 360 and when I sat down to play it on PC I enjoyed it as much as I did when I played it for the first time on Xbox 360...the game was just a bit more difficult..maybe because I played it on Expert Difficulty. The game is beautiful, fun and well full of SPAAAAACE!! (See what I did there)...and sex..don't forget the sex...			",84,9,3,23,5,1,4

												Mass Effect is one of the greatest RPGs in modern gaming. It definitely makes it in my top 10 games of all time. Even though its combat does seem stale and a bit boring the overall epicness and fun of the story definitely makes up for it. The writing definitely makes you feel like a grand space hero and an important figure. All choices do matter and you regret some of them due to the outcome. The character Customization does fall a little short with very little options to chose from. The game sometimes feels unbalanced and can sometimes be extremely difficult. There are some moments with bad dialogue like during combat with enemy and some NPCs. The overall experience is very grand and very fun but it does have some flaws that are a bit annoying. P.S dont even get me started on the elevator rides on the citadel. I give it a 8.2\10 An Amazing and must own game.			",108,7,0,17,8,0,3

												I just got this for a couple of bucks, and after not playing it for several years, I got to say that this game has aged quite well in my opinion. For today's standards (regarding graphics and whatnot), it still holds up, and has some pretty good visuals. They do look a bit dated, of course, but for a game originally released in 2007, it looks great. Several people have complained about the Mako (driving) sections, and while the controls are a bit wonky, it still is a good idea, and it's not as bad as most people make it sound. And now,  let's talk about the heart of this game, and what makes it so special; the expanding, interesting, epic and completely immersive story filled with fully fleshed characters that you care about, amazing plot-twists, and an open ended narrative. This is what makes the ME series so special, along with it's bigger-than life space opera setting. Finally, I have to say that this game is a bargain. It offers at least 30 hours of gameplay, and if you explore every little corner and do every single side quests, those 30 hours could easily stretch to 50. Get this thing ASAP.			",23,3,0,5,1,0,0

												Wow. What a fantastic experience this game was.I've heard so much about this game before actually getting myself to finally play it. Mainly because I'm not a fan of SCI-FI or shooter. Well I wasn't, before I started Mass Effect. This game is incredible. It will drag you in with it's fantastic gameplay, brilliantly written story with massive lore, amazing character development, beautiful music, beautiful landscapes, unique atmosphere, masterfully done voice acting and some of what are probably one of the most memorable characters in the game history. This is one of the rare games I actually finished. I have the tendency to play too many things at once to focus on a single game alone. This game, however, was an exception and getting it was probably one of the best decisions I've made in my life. I got it on sales for an € or so, but it is not only worth it's original price, but double that. I recommend this game to everyone everywhere that cherishes brilliant dialogues, deep character development, huge lore behind the main story, for people that don't want to just walk straight forward and shoot stuff, but for people that enjoy exploring the world they are in, for people that enjoy making decisions and think logically. Truly a masterpiece.			",24,9,0,1,1,0,2

												Part of my all time favorite series (seriously why did everyone hate the ending of ME3 so much?) Mass Effect 1 is a great game with an awesome beginning to the grand story of, well, Mass Effect.Just be warned. Quicksave often, since the only autosaves are 4 hours apart, and the game might bore newcomers until they reach Sovereign in one of the later planets. If you aren't hooked after that then Gone Home might be the game for you.			",176,27,5,20,16,0,18

												Hours are a lie (Were not recorded during offline for some reason). The main story took me around 12 or so hours to complete and I got to say that was one good half of a day. This is the first time I had ever played a mass effect game and with so much talk about how the 3rd ones ending wasn't good I didn't know what to expect, but what I did find was an extremely vast world full of spectacular different species and enviornments as well as a rich and well told narrative following the adventures of Commander Shepard and his crew. I would say the game is nearly perfect but its age has diffently shown. Gunplay seems fairly weak as a result of lack of feedback (imo) and the game is riddled with texture bugs, audio bugs and the occasional screen tear. If these bugs and faults can be put aside, then you will surely be in for one wild ride! ",103,6,0,18,4,1,2

												My second greatest game series of all time. An epic space saga with no equal.Edit:So I thought with the recent release of Mass effect Andromeda, I wanted to add a few things.....I'm a complete ME fanboy, ME1-3 and now Andromeda. You know that guy/girl at the party who's had way too much to drink and says ""I love you man!, No!...you, I love you, you're such a great person and I love you!...."" Well that's me with my Mass effect fetish. It can do NO wrong!Every game in the series has it's flaws, heck, I didn't even think the so called best game in the series, Mass effect 2, was even my favorite but I was still that drunk dude at the party "" I love you man..."" Mass effect 3 original ending? It wasn't that bad, i think gamers have this herd mentality where if a few people hate something about a game, everyone jumps on the bandwagon, especially so with the ending of ME3, I mean sure, Im glad they patched the ending but I didn't need it as such. Andromeda, it's utterly brilliant aside from the current state of models, textures, animations and the convoluted dialogue but again...drunk dude at the party "" I love you man!...""I think if I had a fave ME game though, the original. Why? Because that's where it all started for me, for all of us who like freqenting parties whilst drunk!			",215,40,1,35,13,0,27

												I played this game a few times over and I had Mass Effect 2 plus all the content.Both were great in their own ways.I kind of like Mass Effect 1 here the best.  There's something about all of it that is just way more fun and more interesting.  The 2nd one was more focused on intense combat and it was great and the DLC to it was great... but there's a certain charm to this game.  I wish it were longer quite frankly.That would be the only Con to Mass Effect 1.  It's still a long game but I wish there was more to it.  My cousin likes this one better as well.Played this game multiple times over... never knew you could mantel onto crates.  lol  Made game harder.So ya, you can climb things.Great story and side quests.Really great side quests I thought.I think this game was way ahead of it's time for 2007 or whenever it came out.I guess one more Con would be that chick... Ashely.  Totally ugly and annoying and a terrible character.They could've probably done with some more diverse and interesting characters.  Some party members seem a little cliche and boring.  Especially the girls.  They aren't too interesting, especially when they yammer about god knows what.  I wasn't listening anymore after a while...Awesome game.  Probably timeless.  Worth playing through once.If you're a Sci Fi fan and Exploration junky it's super fun.  Great combat too. ",8,0,0,0,0,0,1

												An excellent game that has a story heavily influenced by Star Trek and Star Wars. The gameplay and story are compelling, although I do think that the oft-binary choices between good and evil hurt the game. Trust me here, it's much more entertaining to watch Shepard be a total jerk (and, occasionally, commit genocide) than it is to make him a goody-two shoes. I'll go ahead and say that I enjoyed this game the most out of the series (though I have not yet played 3), as I thought that the overall story was focused and quite exciting-- well worth playing to the finish.

The graphics have aged poorly, the characters are decently written but still underwhelming, the copy-pasting of levels and the shallow pool of enemy dialogue is likely to drive you insane, the menus and inventories are awful, and the game features little actual feedback for your choices and instead creates an illusion of depth that isn't there.And that's not even going into the quality of the PC port. No controller support, constant glitches both minor and serious, the game constantly changing it's own volume without player input at times setting the volume to max during an already loud cutscene and actually requiring that I remove my headphones, characters will switch back and forth between filtered and unfiltered voice lines so that the Elcor diplomat will sound like an Elcor at one line and a human on the next, save file corruption, abysmal optimization and screen tearing, dialogue skipping on it's own, and game breaking bugs that will trap you in loading and menu screens until you close the game.If you can look past all that, this game is still good. And I would consider it necessary to play to enjoy the next two games fully. Play it once and import your character into ME2 for the optimal experience.			",120,26,0,22,11,3,25

												The first part of one of the most immersive and fascinating video game series' of all time. The music alone deserves a playthrough, not to mention the amazing and complex storyline and the many interesting details that can be found throughout the insanely well-crafted universe. I will never forget Chora's Den or Flux (Shepard-dance, anyone?), the heart-wrenching decisions I had to make, the friends I have found (Anderson! Garrus! Wrex!), or the romances I've had (Ashley! Liara!), and despite the evident weaknesses the game has, when it comes to game mechanics for example, it is still one of my all-time favorites, surpassing even the following games, ME2 and ME3, in some areas. Making different decisions does not only change the course of the story, so that you discover new witty and interesting dialogs every time you play through the game (Shepard: ""I'm p*ssed off. When I get p*ssed off, I shoot things."", discovered on my 3rd playthrough), they do also have an effect on the two successors. My suggestions is this: Get the game, make your OWN Shepard (not the standard one!) and just f*cking enjoy! Take your time, however: This game is not something for ADS kiddies who usually play CoD or Battlefield. It is like a good book, except for all the additional benefits the medium video game has to offer. A gem of a game for connoisseurs.			",222,37,4,24,15,0,21

												I'm recamending this game because of all the Sci-Fi adventure games this one is at the top; it really captures the feeling of Star Trek, a feeling utterly missed by every Star Trek game. But with that said, this game is far from perfect, mostly because it is faced with some massive annoyances: -Unskippable and unpausable cut scenes -A terrible autosave system -Boss's that are just enemies with a massive health bar  -Broken Quick Save SystemThese may not sound like little problems, but lets look at what they all cause. OK lets say you die, not that rare, there are a lot of enemies that can 1 to 2 hit you if you can't see them, this means you are relying on the last save point, but since the environments are so big that means the last auto save could be 30mins ago. ALSO, if there are any cutscenes that occur your going to have to go through them again because unlike 99% of all other games that would autosave your progress after a cutscene, in this game thats not the case. BUT wait there is quick saving right? Wellllll, quick saving only works if there are no enemies, so if there is a string of enemies a long a 30 min trek you are♥♥♥♥♥♥out of luck my friend. The game should keep track of 3 quick saves and allow you to quick save at any point that, that way i don't need to repeat the same 45 mins of my life over again like some lamer version of Groundhogs Day and if I quick save a death by accident I could use the previous quick save. Also, the last boss is a measure of your patients as he is health bar Mcgee, not hard, just repetative and boring.Overall Its a good game, I just wise it didn't make me feel like I was getting in the way of it's story all the time.

												Mass Effect series are some of my personal favorite games. In Mass Effect there is a good storyline, decent action gameplay, great characters, and an amazing sci-fi universe to discover. The main reason I liked this game was the epic story that takes place (well, more like is started) and the choices that you make within that story.Pros-cool sci-fi setting-good storyline-great characters-decent 3rd person shooter-ability to make tons of choices-choices that are made in this game effect the next two games in the seriesCons-not the best graphics (but hey, it was made in 2007)-sometimes frustrating to deal with equipment and item upgrades(9/10)			",37,5,0,9,2,0,4

												Nothing says ""I love you"" like taking your significant other with you on every one of your dangerous missions, and having them shot at from all directions by the Geth. <3If you play this series, consider this first game ""Freshman year"". Everyone is baby faced and you'll be learning the combat system and lore etc. ME2 are your crazy party years, where you're somewhere between having a great time and almost always dying from one dangerous stunt or the other. And if you hit ME3 (which you'll prolly need to sign up on the bullcrap Origin client for) consider that senior year.

												If you like lasting decisions, deep universes, a great progressing character and sleeping with your coworkers this game is for you.I absolutely recommend it for everybody. Your decisions are carried out through the following parts as well, there are mainly two ways to go, paragon or renegade, but you always can spice things up with changing a single decision and see what happens.Playthrough in about 12 hours even on high difficulty, this game lifes more on its story than your combat ski8lls, but this doesn't bother me a bit.Have played through it about 10 times and will do it again if I get the chance.

												This one had the best gameplay in the series in my opinion. Probably going to get lynched for saying that but it's true. This is the only Mass Effect that is actually an RPG. They managed to make a super awesome shooter RPG with 6 different classes and an adequately complex levelling system and inventory management. And for Mass Effect 2 they threw all of that out the window, removed the whole inventory thing completely and made the levelling system the simplest any RPG has ever had, which is why I hesitate to call Mass Effect 2 or 3 an RPG.This one also has the best story, and so it's pretty much better than Mass Effect 2 and 3 in every way, except for graphics. 10/10 best Mass Effect game to date, fingers crossed for Andromeda.

Part shooter part RPG, it tells the story of Commander Shepard and crew trying to defeat an ancient alien species that threatens the universe. There is a lot to uncover in the game, but the mixing of RPG and shooter makes you feel the story, wanting to be involved. Plus it has very cool characters with cool weapons and powers.

												I first bought Mass Effect, played 40 minutes and shelved it 6 months. Only after I gave it a second chance I truly discovered  the jewel this sci-fi RPG is.The story is compelling and the background is rich, capable of going toe to toe with the best RPGs and even film franchises like Star Trek. The philosophical scope is intriguing and profound, be it about the origins of the universe, racism or politics.Some aspects are rather unpolished (like the inventory system) or just plain confusing (like the battle interface) but in general the game is enjoyable if you have the patience to invest in it. It is now one of my favorite game franchises.			",250,84,3,48,36,4,65

												For any gamer out there, Mass Effect is a must play.  This game is a third-person, role playing, story-driven shooter and it successfully accomplishes all it sets out to be.  The main storyline clocks in at around 13 hours but the game is packed with other missions and planets to explore on your own time.  Throughout the exploration and firefights, you will surely become attached to certain characters, so decisions you'll have to make later will put you in a cold sweat.  Shooting mechanics in this game are solid, but sometimes feel lacking.  As for the leveling system, not all the skill points you earn feel as if they've gone to any use since there is such a large array of skills and plenty of point slots necessary to fill so as to reach the next power.  All in all, this game is highly recommended to anyone looking for a fantastic single player game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was struggled for a very long time if I should buy this game or not.I regret that I didn't buy it sooner.It is one of the Top 10 best games I have played. The gameplay might be a bit monotonus, but rewarding items, the story and your possible decisions make up for it.When I first played it I was AMAZED by how well every detail is described. Why the machines and weapons work and what they do. What every alien species backstory is and why they behave like they behave.It's a whole new universe to discover. I haven't seen any game before that cared so much about filling every logical hole and describing so much details, expanding the story to such great amounts. Awesome!Also, if you're a fan of astronomy, you'll love it so much more. Enjoy the most epic views of standing on a planets moon, being on a planet of a binary star system, or watch thousands of meteors raining down from the sky.As a fan of science, you might notice some physical details which aren't correct as they are. Like planets temperature described as going below the point of absolute zero (-273,18°C is not possible), our local sun shining yellow in space, or other little details. Nothing what would involve gameplay or bother you in some way.All in all, great game. I love it, I am a fan of the Mass Effect Universe now.			",124,31,1,8,10,1,4

												Mass Effect is probably one of my most played games to date (just behind Mass Effect 2). Although I believe Mass Effect 2 is the superior of the two games in question (1 and 2), this is where the journey began - and should begin for you. I would (and do) highly recommend the Mass Effect Trilogy to anyone who finds themselves enthralled with single player experiences and Mass Effect is one of the best you can find.I am currently on my second playthough of the Mass Effect Trilogy and I'm sure when I'm finished I will jump straight back in to Mass Effect 1 again. Mass Effect follows what I like to call the ""constants and variables"" theory of storytelling. This means that the story has a few key sections that all players will experience, yet the road there can be different from person-to-person. Moreover, the types of decisions you make can also affect the outcome these ""constant"" events. The main decision elements come from your ability to either take a Paragon (good) or a Renegade (somewhat evil, more of a♥♥♥♥♥♥really) approach to decision making, earning points through doing so allows you to automatically open up more conversation options to enhance your experience.I personally feel that Mass Effect has pretty good character customisation - with not just how they look, but how you lay out your play style for the rest of the game. Being an infiltrator allows you to snip enemies from afar to deal a lot of damage. Whereas, you have a soldier who is a master of all weapons and usually likes to be in the thick of the action. The same can also be said of a Vanguard, they mix the world of Biotics (like superpowers) and guns together.The only downside to Mass Effect 1 is the glitches that can occur (and usually do for me), but a quick google of fixes usually resolves the issue. The hacking system is also only a minor gripe at what is one of my favourite games.In conclusion, the positives of Mass Effect extremely out weight the negatives. 9/10 from me (because it's not Mass Effect 2)			",63,4,1,4,6,0,3

												the pc port is pretty bad, it doesnt launch after installing(dont even know how i fixed that), the game was clearly made for console input and nobody bothered to change anything.But ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you can see through the bugs and input.. its my new favorite game series, with this being a GREAT start to a eventfull story that opens up a interesting and (at most times) diverse galaxy of worlds to explore. you play allong charismatic characters and get to choose your own behaviour.play the first 4 hours of this game and you'll play another 200 (with ME2 and ME3 included)			",108,15,3,6,21,0,6

												Mass Effect has a deep story line. You can choose to flesh it out with side missions or stick to the meat and potatoes of the main story arc. You have multiple personality options, and can customize your character into very interesting niche roles if you choose.Awesome way to fill your day!			",49,3,0,9,2,2,14

												The mass effect series is by far my favorite game series ever.  The first title in the series has sort of wierd combat and a wierd inventory system, but where the first mass effect game excells is the story and character development and introducing the player to the univerese of mass effect to prepare for the other 2 games.  The other 2 games have waaay better gameplay mechanics, but in order to truly delve into one of the most interesting and exciting sci fi stories ever, you have to play this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A must have for any rpg fan.Great game, great start to a very well done trilogy.I personally liked how skills and weapons worked even though they got changed in 2&3 (many liked the 2nd game more because of how it worked)Gameplay is a bit slow at times, but there's still events happening so it's not just time wasted if you pay attention there's a lot of talk happening around you, which makes the game feel a bit more alive.Overall, great product from Bioware. Highly recommended.P.S. Sad that ME3 isn't on steam Q_Q			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Story driven third person shooter. Lets you decide what happens to the galaxy. Will you punch a reported and it will have after affects for 2 games. Or will you answer her questions. It is all up to you. I absolutely love this game, the mechanics and leveling system are great, the 2 follow up games not so much. This is the most expansive Mass Effect game to date. I recommend playing it with MEUITM (Mass Effect Upgraded/Improved Textures and Meshes) It's a mod which makes the game simply look more attractive.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I first played through the Mass Effect series on the PS3, and I can confidently say that this game (and series) is the best game I have ever played. I don't know how long it'll stay that way, but it sure holds a solid position in my number 1 spot. The characters are people you will never forget, the decisions you make enrich your entire experience, the environments are story-filled and interesting, and so on. I strongly encourage everyone to play this series. The hours I've put into this series are hours that I will never forget.			",96,49,2,20,10,0,4

												The first entry in the Mass Effect trilogy is both the start of a much larger story and a superb stand-alone experience. It created a rich sci-fi setting and infused it with deep RPG-style gameplay and great interactive dialogue; it was also BioWare's first foray into cover-based shooting, which would become a defining element its sequels.The most impressive feature of Mass Effect is the writing; characters and environments are all well-developed, and the story contains many powerful, unforgettable moments. Also impressive is the variety in the gameplay, which includes deep dialogue trees, complex shooting, and exploring the galaxy for resources and optional quests. There is an extensive amount of micromanagement required when equipping weapons, armor, and mods for each character; it can be cumbersome, but also adds a good deal of depth and replay value. Compared with its sequels, Mass Effect feels very rough around the edges. There are a number of bugs and glitches – some fun, others annoying – along with inconsistencies in difficulty and other inconveniences like long elevator rides. The lack of polish hurts the game, but never stops it from being fun. Problems and all, Mass Effect is a tremendously entertaining game that still has strong appeal for RPG fans and anyone who loves a great sci-fi story. It's also worth checking out for those who only played the sequels, provided they're willing to be patient with some of its less accessible features.(Rating: 8.5/10 “Excellent”)			",55,15,0,13,0,0,2

												I don't have the Mass Effect triology on steam, just the first game, so I'm going to put my reviews of all three games here. As I play the games, I will add onto this review. I am also fairly confident that I am leaving all spoilers, or at least most, out.Mass Effect 1 Review:Storyline: Amazing. One of the best. Better than Half Life and SW:KOTOR (The best two I've ever played)The character building in this game is AMAZING. See, they kill one good guy in the first game, and at first, you're all sad and angry when they did it. You're raging with tears in your eyes. I say, wait a second. Hold up. You're getting these emotions because the developers did their job. The characters have emitted extreme amounts of personality, and those personalities you have become attatched to. This isn't a reason to get angry, it's a reason to appreciate the developer. There is a scene in this game where a good guy dies, and no matter how much of a cold, heartless, emotionless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you are, you will feel the emotions. You will cry a little bit. Others will cry alot. This just means that they did their job right. I mean, some of the guys in this game just show so much personality..      it's rare, but amazing. Graphics: Stale in certain aspects, but still amazing. Humans look realer than real. Aliens look..     just really, really real. When you talk to a character named Wrex, look at the lighting, the detail, everything. He looks..     just, amazing. It's like that for everyone. Screen effects are also good, as well as lighting effects.Mechanics: No such thing as headshots, but other than that, this is perfect. There is also a auto aim feature if you want to play the game with your eyes closed, or when drunk.Weapons: Annoying and worthless as♥♥♥♥♥♥in the early game, but they progressively get better. Overpowered as hell in the end of the game and in the second playthrough.Squad Ideas: Very useful. Little bit of ideas from Republic Commando, some from SW:KOTOR, and some from Ghost: Recon. Only the best. Freedom: It's the kind of thing where you think that the game has so much content because you're doing as much as you can and you're not hitting the boundaries, but little do you know that the boundaries are milimeters after what you're testingMMO Aspect: Still presentContent: Almost unlimited. This game took me 69 hours to compelte my first playthrough. I went a pure week straight of doing nothing with my life other than playing Mass Effect for 20 hours a day. Literally, only breaks I would take are sleeping and♥♥♥♥♥♥breaks. I can do that now that I'm off school for the summer.Comfortable for long gaming sessions, and I wouldn't have it any other way.The astronomy in this game is also a nice touch. See, for me, there's nothing more interesting than other planets, stars, solar systems, space, and things like that. You can explore so many planets, so many solar systems, stars, it's amazing. You kind of have to be obsessive with astronomy like I am to appreciate it, but I had a good 20 hours of heaven just exploring these planets and things like that. About a third of them you can land on and explore. All of them have stories and descriptions. It's just, amazing.Advice: 1. LISTEN to the dialogue. That's how the story is built. Study it like you were in college listening to a professor. 2. Do the mission on planet Virmire last. You're squad is permanently weakened for the rest of the game here.3. Talk to your companions between every mission you do, even if it seems they constantly have nothing new to say (which is rare)4. For god's sake, save frequently!5. Don't ♥♥♥♥ 2 ♥♥♥♥♥es at a time. That won't make them happy, and you'll get no ♥♥♥♥♥ at all. If you want to ♥♥♥♥ 2 ♥♥♥♥♥es, ♥♥♥♥ one in your first playthrough, and ♥♥♥♥ the second in the next playthrough.6. Save on to your savegame files. You can import your character into the next game, which includes your decsisions. If you save someone, they save you in ME2 or ME3. If you execute someone, they'll probably have a person in their life who will stop at nothing to cause you major inconveniences.7. MAX OUT YOUR CHARM ABILITY, and go paragon! Star Wars has light side and dark side. Paragron is the light side. Renegade is the dark side. Going Paragon is pretty much hitting the blue conversation option every time it appears. You can save all of your companions (but one) if you do! And the ones you save will come back to save you in the next game!Mass Effect 2 Review:Mass Effect 2 all depends on how you play it, what you get done, and when you do it. If you do it wrong, you will be so angry with this game ruining the story that you will never play a Mass Effect game ever again. Trust me. If you plan to play it, take my advice. There's an ending in this story where had I gotten it, I can tell you that I would have spend every last breathe of my life tracking down who ever the hell ruined the game and giving him a long, painful death. If you can get away from this terrible ending, however, the game is very, very impressive and very, very admirable. I already told you what I think of the game with the bad ending, now I'm going to tell you what I think of the good ending and the rest of the game.First Impression on Controls: ""Wow, these controls are screwey! Spacebar is sprint? Shift is my ability overlay? What the ♥♥♥♥! I'm changing!""5 minutes later..Okay, still annoying.♥♥♥♥♥♥controles.2 hours later..Okay, not too bad.Now..♥♥♥♥ing amazing.Be sure just to change your controls to what you're used to, but make sure you keep Q and E as their defaults. Trust me on that. No matter how painful it is, you will adapt, and it will be worth it.First Impression on Story: ""What the ♥♥♥♥? No! DUDE WHAT THE ACTUAL ♥♥♥♥! I'm uninstalling. ♥♥♥♥ the developers. ♥♥♥♥ ME. ♥♥♥♥ Bioware. ♥♥♥♥ YOU!""30 minutes later..""Joker? JOKER I LOVE YOU YOU ARE AMAZING I WANT TO HAVE MY KIDS WITH YOU!""2 hours later..""I don't appreciate the beginning, but I see why they did it.""6 hours later..""Wow. Wow. Wow. Okay. Just, Wow. I love this game. I don't believe it, but I forgive them for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ beginning. In fact, I'm kind of glad it happened.""Now""I understand why they did it, and I don't care. I've even gone back to watch it again and it couldn't seem to hit my 'care' button""Advice:1. Do all of your loyalty missions for your companions BEFORE doing the IFF mission. Pretty much talk to them and do them a few personal favors. No, I'm not telling you why. No, I'm not telling you what IFF is. I said I'd keep spoilers out, and I feel I have a very good job. 2. Upgrade you ship. 100%.  Trust me. 3. If you have to get a savegame editor to be able to afford the materials to do it, I understand, and will provide you with a download link to one. It will take hours of just pure scanning planets for materials in order to afford them all.http://social.bioware.com/project/4373/4. Save frequently.5. Max out your squad's and your own class ability. These abilities pretty much max out the damage and health of someone. After you're done with that, if you're a soldier, for yourself, max out the disrupter and the incidiary ammo. Very useful agains droids, and very useful against flesh. After maxed out, make them squad incidiary and squad disrupter ammo.Mass Effect 3 Review: Pending			",198,9,0,24,6,0,20

												Epic voice acting.  Smart science.  Rich and developed world.  deep decision options.  Compelling and engaging characters.  This is the first installment of a near legendary game series.  The only weakness for this game in the line in particular is the almost necessary micro management of your inventory.  That is easily tolerable to set up a solid profile to carry through rest of the games.  If you have any enjoyment of story driven games you owe it to yourself to pick it up.My one genuine con:  Mass Effect 3 is not available on Steam.  Not cool EA.9/10			",153,67,0,10,4,2,7

												Where it all began! The first chapter in one of Bioware's greatest franchises... and then Mass Effect 3 :P+ Great tactical RPG/Shooter hybrid combat system+ Myriad of customization options for your Shepard and every companion you have+ Very well written plot that does a good job setting up events for the sequels+ Good graphics powered by Unreal Engine 3+ High quality character models and decent textures for weapons and armor+ A fair amount of sidequests and collectibles to find, both for codex entries and just for rewards+ Much of the game will hold your attention for extended periods of time, due to set pieces throughout and plot developments that you may or may not anticipate+ Great voice acting talent for all companions and most NPCs- Overly complex inventory system- After the first mission (Eden Prime), the game becomes slow for a period of time- Many class abilities ultimately become irrelevant and redundant as the game progressesAll in all, Mass Effect 1 is a very solid and remarkable sci-fi RPG that serves its purpose of introducing the ME franchise in spades.89/100.

												Once again, why have i not played this game sooner? I made fun of people who told me this game would swallow my soul, chew on my emotions and spit me out again. They were right.It's not only the gameplay, but also the story, the visuals, the music (never underestimate that!). First time ever i sat through the ending titles of a game.The track at the end captures the game perfectly.

												Mass Effect is an space adventure RPG like no other, one that will stand the test of time long after people forget about the ME 3 endings. While it is a great game it does suffer its flaws, such as the mako driving segments (which I personally like but I do understand and see why some wouldn't like it), the container minigames, and some of the side missions which can become tedious. Even with those flaws this game is a must buy for any rpg or sci fi fan.			",289,31,7,41,23,0,43

												The main storyline and dialogs are very interesting, although, most of the secondary quests are repetitive and boring. The graphics still look decent, especially when you consider that it was released back in 2007. The gameplay is average – nothing super spectacular, but not terrible. The only real problem for me was autosave system. It saves very rarely, so if you don't want to replay half an hour of the game, you will have to press quick save button. A lot.

												In my opinion this game is the best of the Series, because it's the least streamlined one with the most choices and freedom of play and with the least amount of completely linear nerfhearding tunnelmaps. The combat in ME3 is better, but the cost is too high. Pro:+ Lots of different guns and armor with a ton of different mods. Lots of useless ones too. + Lots of dialogue and very few cutscenes. + Pretty funny dialogue choices at times, especially the Renegade options can be pretty funny and abusive. + Big square planet maps & the Mako. The only game in the ME series with a tactical choice. + Experience points for Kills. Time to go hunting for Thresher Maws & Geth! + Unlimited ammo, but with overheating and recoil. Nice diversity of guns and mechanics. + Import of previous 'veteran' characters.. Practically no level limit..  + Lots of skills. Cons:- The dialogue choices doesn't quite reflect what's being said. Quite often far from it. It's a gamble. How's that RPG?- Quite often different dialogue options leads to the same result or none at all. Just for show. - Once you are overloaded you can't sort through your entire inventory to scrap the least useful ones in favor of the last additions, which often happens to be a lot better than anything else you've got.. (Bleh, Of course). - No three-some!! Just like any other BioWare game it enforce ancient and unnatural monogamous relationships.			",73,19,1,12,0,0,2

												Still excellent after all these years. Vocals, music and sound effects are on point. Graphics are dated but didn't bother me, still looked nice enough. The story is great. Combat felt a little weird but I got used to it. Overall very good purchase. If you haven't played it and like rpg's, I highly recommend it.  Also can be modded and you can enable dev console for extra shenanigans.			",1230,377,57,124,120,15,133

												Good game, not as good as its sequals in my opinion but it sets off the story nicely. It is very satisfying to be able to use the same character you have created through all three games and to have a story that continues in Mass Effect 2 and 3. This game has action, interesting enemies, weapons and NPC's as well as a very interesting, and sometimes hilarious, relationship build-up with a member of your team. Just one of the reasons to do a second runthrough of the game is to hook up with another NPC than the first time.The only negative I can think of is that there is no guide to how to move around or use combat. A training instruction before the real action starts would have helped me from constantly dying early on. Something I appreciated to Mass Effect 2 were the ""Combat Training"" videos that guided you to understanding how to fight.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The controll scheme is a bit clunky and the inventory system is a chore, but once you get past that you will find one of biowares best stories. it basicly takes all the lessons bioware learned with jade empire, devolps them a bit and then puts them in space. All in all a great rpgshooter.			",433,115,12,79,23,4,68

												Very good Sci-fi RPG.You choose a class and level your characters like any other RPG game, but the combat is a real-time 3rd person shooter. Building and strengthing your character is just as important as your ability to dodge enemy fire, use cover, and score headshots for critical damage. The game also has different difficulties settings to choose from in case you need to lower it. You also have 2 teammates with you at any given time.Aside from combat; you can literally spend hours at a time just going around exploring, talking to people, and reading codexes you come across (bits of information about certain guns or whatever). Some people love this stuff, others hate it, so its purely preference if you'll like it or not. The main highlight of this game though is the option to choose your own path/dialogue. You can pretty much apologize to someone, agree to disagree, or sometimes just straight up punch them in their face. Then the next time you meet this person down the road, IF you meet them again, they'll remember how the previous conversation went and it affects the feel of the game. It might even open or close off certain things. The overall core storyline of the game is the same though, you can't change that. It's also a trilogy. Certain decisions you make can span from game 1 game into the next if you transfer save files.It's a well-made game for its genre (and an even better trilogy). So if you're not into these type of games (Sci-fi / shooter / Action RPG / deep storytelling with alot of decisions and information/lore) then you simply won't like it.Cons: A few times playing this game I had to load an older save file due to some weird glitches happening. Maybe 3 times in 50+ hours of playing. (only lost a total of 10 minutes of playtime or so). Other than that the game ran fine for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I highly recommend this game for anyone who is interested in a FPS game with a rich story.You can explore the milky way galaxy with many solar systems, all having their own planets. The main storyline is engaging and fun, and the side quests are meaningful and often change the dialogue you can exchange with other characters. The romantic subplots are also very interesting and allow insight into the background of your characters. The option to play as a Paragon or a Renegade based on the qualities of your actions is also a nice dynamic allowing moral feedback for your character. All in all, one of the best games I have ever played and definitely has a high replay value.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not planning to say something new about the game. It's one of the forever classics, no matter how much casual is that poor sci-fi (I've been raised on the sci-fi classics of 70-ies and earlier). When I tried it first time, I've been constantly struggling with the poorly explained stuff, yet it's the charismatic setting that made me love it nonetheless.			",136,40,0,12,9,0,9

												This one had the best gameplay in the series in my opinion. Probably going to get lynched for saying that but it's true. This is the only Mass Effect that is actually an RPG. They managed to make a super awesome shooter RPG with 6 different classes and an adequately complex levelling system and inventory management. And for Mass Effect 2 they threw all of that out the window, removed the whole inventory thing completely and made the levelling system the simplest any RPG has ever had, which is why I hesitate to call Mass Effect 2 or 3 an RPG.This one also has the best story, and so it's pretty much better than Mass Effect 2 and 3 in every way, except for graphics. 10/10 best Mass Effect game to date, fingers crossed for Andromeda.

												I picked this up during the X-mas sale and only recently installed it. I generally don't play shooters, but Mass Effect has a healthy dose of searching and exploring and story. I've always played ""lurkers"" in games, rather kill from the shadows. }:>I chose the Infiltrator class (I know, my friends are totally shocked) even though I read from several sources that the sniper rifle was a pain to master. It is a pain, but I can live with that. Took me more than a few occasions to unlearn that the spacebar does not make you jump... probable the only thing that bothers me so far. Because when I explore I like to jump and climb on things. I'm enjoying it very much so far at least I would hope so considering that I logged 6.6 hours on my first night of playing. :)So yeah, I'd recommend it.PS: sinewav put up a nice beginner's guide that explains the classes pretty well and what he considers their strengths and weaknesses, recommendations on how difficult newbs might find each class, on the crew you should pair up with them to fill in the holes. And I think he did a good job of it without filling it with spoilers. You can find it here:

												A masterpiece of a series; Mass Effect is a three part space opera with rich lore and great action.

It might even open or close off certain things. The overall core storyline of the game is the same though, you can't change that. It's also a trilogy. Certain decisions you make can span from game 1 game into the next if you transfer save files.It's a well-made game for its genre (and an even better trilogy). So if you're not into these type of games (Sci-fi / shooter / Action RPG / deep storytelling with alot of decisions and information/lore) then you simply won't like it.Cons: A few times playing this game I had to load an older save file due to some weird glitches happening. Maybe 3 times in 50+ hours of playing. (only lost a total of 10 minutes of playtime or so). Other than that the game ran fine for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I picked this up during the X-mas sale and only recently installed it. I generally don't play shooters, but Mass Effect has a healthy dose of searching and exploring and story. I've always played ""lurkers"" in games, rather kill from the shadows. }:>I chose the Infiltrator class (I know, my friends are totally shocked) even though I read from several sources that the sniper rifle was a pain to master. It is a pain, but I can live with that. Took me more than a few occasions to unlearn that the spacebar does not make you jump... probable the only thing that bothers me so far. Because when I explore I like to jump and climb on things. I'm enjoying it very much so far at least I would hope so considering that I logged 6.6 hours on my first night of playing. :)So yeah, I'd recommend it.PS: sinewav put up a nice beginner's guide that explains the classes pretty well and what he considers their strengths and weaknesses, recommendations on how difficult newbs might find each class, on the crew you should pair up with them to fill in the holes. And I think he did a good job of it without filling it with spoilers. You can find it here:

												A masterpiece of a series; Mass Effect is a three part space opera with rich lore and great action. While definitely showing its age the original Mass Effect is still a great game that opens the door for writers to take the story in any direction, it is the best possible introduction to an incredibly large universe and I recommend playing it before starting Mass Effect 2.

												I bought Mass Effect recently for my run through of the entire series, and I have to say, I am impressed. I expected a really bad game that I would play ""for the story."" I was wrong. This was an absolutely great experience. There are a few things that were frustrating, such as the repetative land rover missions, and the way the Citidel was laid out. The Citidel is your center hub of trade and activity, for people that don't know much about the Mass Effect universe. The story was fantastic, the characters so belivable, however the combat was a bit rough due to the sheer age of the game. It doesn't take long to get used to the outdated combat and graphics, and once that is aside, everything is so much fun. One of the best RPGs of it's kind.			",90,4,0,13,11,0,8

												Mass Effect: The one game series that has always had a special place in my game library, I bought Mass Effect 1 as a totally random game that looked cool in my local store, and then I went home and played it through once, twice, and a few times more until I managed to grind the right choices, and then I went forward to ME2 and ME3, one by one, replaying each many times, I've played many story-based games, but I am still to find a game series with more capturing RPG Storyline.Mass Effect 1: Best story overall.Mass Effect 2: Most epic gameplay.Mass Effect 3: Most enjoyable gameplay and story.I personally give them all 10/10 -""The games are really epic even though the ending is a minor dissapointment, still waiting anxiously for Mass Effect: Andromeda!""

Part shooter part RPG, it tells the story of Commander Shepard and crew trying to defeat an ancient alien species that threatens the universe. There is a lot to uncover in the game, but the mixing of RPG and shooter makes you feel the story, wanting to be involved. Plus it has very cool characters with cool weapons and powers. Hell, it even has a sex scene… ",39,7,0,7,0,0,2

If you haven't played this game, JUST GET IT. Don't even think about it. Just play it.I personally prefer Mass Effect 1 to Mass Effect 2, although both are amazing games. However in Mass Effect 1 there were character development and alot more progression on the story, whereas in Mass Effect 2 it was mostly about developing relationships with other characters.

												You get to play a commander in space, choose your own face, backstory and which teammate you'd rather sacrifice!On a visual point, the cutscenes weren't very coherent; it was like shooting random scenes and jamming them all together. You can choose whether your Shepard is a male or female, your backstory for Shepard and customize their physical attributes, such as hair style, skin color, eye color, etc. Once you've chosen your final look, you can no longer change it.Mass Effect is a third-person shooter where choices matter. Well, not really, but your choices in the game will dictate what will happen next. The lore is vast and meticulously thought out. The game is about mankind and its role among the other life in the universe. You get to decide what kind of role humanity will play in this universe.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you are into the Mass Effect series, you should play through this game at least once.You play as commander Shepard, a military Alliance Officer on the spaceship Normandy. On a routine mission, you accidentaly activate an alien artifact, leading to a series of events that affect the galaxy as a whole. You pick up several squad mates along the way, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. The strongest reason to pick this one up is the superb story. It has some interesting twists and turns, which had me on the edge of my seat multiple times. this story really sets the tone for the second and third games. As this is a proper Bioware title, expect plenty of romance options and spot on dialogue. The story is definitely the best of the series. The second to me felt more like a big sidequest and let's not even talk about the third. Mass Effect really sets up the universe nicely and introduces you to all of the different alien races and worlds. Also, you can import your Mass Effect save file on the second game, allowing you to retain the universe as you left it and this leads to interesting conversations and unexpected meetings.It's not all good though. The graphics definitely look dated. Fortunately, there are some mods out there that somewhat fix this. The combat is definitely the worst in the series. Abilities have long, individual cooldowns, and most guns feel completely useless until you've specced heavily into their respective skills. Also, the different classes aren't balanced well. Some are definitely a lot stronger than others, resulting in multiple viable playstyles and team setups. The weaker classes are simply not as fun to play. Also, on higher difficulties most enemies get insane damage resistance, without really getting stronger or smarter. This draws the game out, without adding a significant challenge. Mass Effect 2 did this much better. The planet exploration sections are pretty bad, but fortunately they are mostly skippable.In summary, get this game if you really like sci-fi or you've already played the second and third Mass Effect games and love the universe. It's definitely not a bad pickup for anyone else, but for the money there are plenty of better options out there.			",76,16,1,15,12,0,31

												A masterpiece of a series; Mass Effect is a three part space opera with rich lore and great action. While definitely showing its age the original Mass Effect is still a great game that opens the door for writers to take the story in any direction, it is the best possible introduction to an incredibly large universe and I recommend playing it before starting Mass Effect 2.

												When I first played this game for Xbox360 when I borrowed it from my big brother, it took me four days to beat it.  I was only focusing on the story missions and no side quests, and it still took me 4 days to beat it; I survived on nothing but chili dogs with rock hard buns.  Worth every penny, and now at 19.99 it is an outright steal!  However I have to mention if you finish this game and end up loving it, don't play Mass Effect 2 and 3; just play Dragon Age Origins after this and let Bioware die in your eyes as a good game company...  Rest In Peace BIOWARE, you are sorely missed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A truly fantastic and great game. Though I'm incredibly late to the party, I'm glad I finally decided to play through and beat this game. For the most part, it's a 3rd person shooter, but it's not typical. At the same time, the gameplay isn't exactly groundbreaking. There's elements of customization, minimal squad control that makes this game stand out from other 3rd person shooters, and space navigation that isn't too hands on. What really grabbed my attention about this game was its immersiveness and the setting that is gradually revealed to you. For the most part, the story isn't also particularly original *SPOILER WARNING* it involves you chasing after a rogue alien who's attempting to bring the downfall of all known civilizations in this game's galaxy. Though that isn't quite original, the way the story is revealed to you is quite interesting. Through journal entries, conversations, and general observations, you as a player begin to learn about the setting of this game. Though it's not essential to the game, you can exhaust character conversations in order to be better informed of what's going on outside of the game's storyline. Overall, I rate this game a 4/5 and I highly recommend it if you're into action RPGs and enjoy science fiction as much as I do.			",207,28,7,16,9,0,14

												I admit that, even though I had heard so many good things about the ME series, I didn't actually try out the game until now. And even though it's not exactly state of the art anymore... it still managed to get me hooked quickly. Yes, it's a few years old, yes, the graphics won't do well if compared to more recent games. But OMG, talk about an immersive game. There are quite a few similarities to KOTOR 1 and 2... its obvious it's the same developer. So if you enjoyed the incredible stories in the KOTOR-games, give this a try. KOTOR of course also was fun because it was set in the SW-universe, and in a very interesting era of that franchise, the old republic. Jedis, the Force, the Dark side etc.So I wasn't sure I'd warm up to a very different universe and franchise. And even though I haven't progressed very far yet, I already do care a lot about the story and the characters. Amazing. The story IS captivating, and so is the combat. It's not the turn-based lightsaber/force-combat of KOTOR, of course - instead, its a tactical shooter, not turn-based. And it's FUN even though I'm usually not at all into that genre at all. I haven't even used my squad that much, still warming up to controlling and using my companions but even without that deeper element of the game, I enjoy the action-part of the game a lot. Taking cover, using tactics, choosing your wep, trying to find a good tactic or going for the dangerous method... FUN. And again, I usually am not a fan of shooters. The story is totally captivating and interesting. I am not sure whether the balance will work for everyone (sometimes, there is a lot of running around, talking to people etc, before it goes back to action), but for me it works. And the speech Capt. Anderson gives to his crew rather early on in the game actually gave me goosebumps, I admit it. Heroic moment ftw. The writing rocks, and so do the characters.Now, keep in mind this game is a bit older. Apart from the graphics which isn't state of the art, there are some issues with the combat. Sometimes, you might be taking cover but can't fire for some reason. You can see the enemy, have a clear line of sight, yet can't shoot until you move a bit more. There are some issues with the Mako too...driving it can be fun, but I had some situations where it bounced like a rubber ball and fell off a cliff. Targeting with it has some issues too...clear line of sight at a drone, shoot, not hitting at all (keep in mind that you have to keep some distance in between the vehicle and enemies when using the Mako)The game, like KOTOR shows you a very clear path to your objectives. So you won't run around forever to find a special room... the path is dictated to you rather clearly. This might bother some, I was ok with it. The Citadel is a bit confusing sometimes, but that's ok. I am amazed by how quickly the game captivated me, and I'm not even far into it yet! I can perfectly understand just why this game is so popular and revered. DOn't let the age scare you away (same with Kotor, and this game looks much better). Amazing.Edit: about 10 hrs in... the story gets even more interesting, and the game really makes you think about dialogue choices and decisions you make. It's not always black and white for sure, and I am planning on using my save games to continue through ME2 and 3, so I hope the choices are ok. If not, I'll start over =)EDIT: OK, finished it. I didn't do a lot of the side-quests, focussed mainly on the storyline. I am rather certain I will at some point go back, start over, try some different choices and do the side-quests too. Biggest complaint? It's TOO SHORT!!! (15.7 hours is what the Steam-counter says) However, it's thoroughly enjoyable. The storyline is totally fascinating, and often reminded me of the old Babylon 5-show regarding scope, mystery and background. Great writing, some fascinating twists, several fistpump-moments for the player.No wonder this game is so popular and beloved. On to ME2 now!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mass Effect is an space adventure RPG like no other, one that will stand the test of time long after people forget about the ME 3 endings. While it is a great game it does suffer its flaws, such as the mako driving segments (which I personally like but I do understand and see why some wouldn't like it), the container minigames, and some of the side missions which can become tedious. Even with those flaws this game is a must buy for any rpg or sci fi fan.			",289,31,7,41,23,0,43

												The main storyline and dialogs are very interesting, although, most of the secondary quests are repetitive and boring. The graphics still look decent, especially when you consider that it was released back in 2007. The gameplay is average – nothing super spectacular, but not terrible. The only real problem for me was autosave system. It saves very rarely, so if you don't want to replay half an hour of the game, you will have to press quick save button. A lot.

												In my opinion this game is the best of the Series, because it's the least streamlined one with the most choices and freedom of play and with the least amount of completely linear nerfhearding tunnelmaps. The combat in ME3 is better, but the cost is too high. Pro:+ Lots of different guns and armor with a ton of different mods. Lots of useless ones too. + Lots of dialogue and very few cutscenes. + Pretty funny dialogue choices at times, especially the Renegade options can be pretty funny and abusive. + Big square planet maps & the Mako. The only game in the ME series with a tactical choice. + Experience points for Kills. Time to go hunting for Thresher Maws & Geth! + Unlimited ammo, but with overheating and recoil. Nice diversity of guns and mechanics. + Import of previous 'veteran' characters.. Practically no level limit..  + Lots of skills. Cons:- The dialogue choices doesn't quite reflect what's being said. Quite often far from it. It's a gamble. How's that RPG?- Quite often different dialogue options leads to the same result or none at all. Just for show. - Once you are overloaded you can't sort through your entire inventory to scrap the least useful ones in favor of the last additions, which often happens to be a lot better than anything else you've got.. (Bleh, Of course). - No three-some!! Just like any other BioWare game it enforce ancient and unnatural monogamous relationships.			",73,19,1,12,0,0,2

												What can I say about this game that already hasn't been said?I'll try and do this game justice with what I'm about to write.The story is brilliant and sets up the rest of the following games very well. Your choices matter and will affect the end result further down the line.Character development is strong. With Garrus being my favourite team member. Seriously, that Turian is awesome. Male Shepard and Garrus are the best bromance I've ever seen in a game.The RPG elements are in depth and gives you the opportunity to mould your character in any way you want.The combat is slightly lacklustre, but it can be forgiven and doesn't detract from the core game.One main negative that a lot of people didn't like was the Mako. Sure it was ungainly and could almost climb near vertical cliffs. But I rather enjoyed the exploration it opened up for you.You could travel to a planet, land on it and search locations noted on your map. Most of these locations didn't add anything to the main story line, but for me it brought me into the world more, it added lore and detail to the world.Mass Effect is starting to look slightly outdated these days, though that is a given considering that it's over 8 years old from its first release date.Buy this game, just for the fact that it'll suck you in and prepare you for the awesome ride that is Mass Effect 2 and most of 3. (I won't go into the details of 3 here, but I'm sure most people know of what I'm on about).			",123,22,0,22,9,0,31

												A really good action/RPG game in every aspect. The story, voice acting, graphics, sound, music and gameplay are all good.The game seems like a fusion of Dragon Age, KOToR and Neverwinter Nights all wrapped up together in a wonderful package. If you liked any of those games, you will undoubtedly like this!You follow the path of Shepard (male or female depending on your preference) in a desperate attempt to save the galaxy from the ominous Reapers. Along the way you recruit companions, fall in love and make tough decisions. It also allows for a little exploration in form of the many sidequests. You get to select from a multitude of different classes and level-up and outfit the characters however you want. It also features a squad ordering system (although basic) to position your squad tactically. The combat is in the form of an over-the-shoulder third person, cover-based shooter. It works well here when combined with your squads various strengths and weaknesses.All-in-all, a very good game that I would recommend to everyone interested in the format.Jimbo Rating: 8/10			",134,5,5,9,5,0,4

												Mass Effect is a game that is synonymous with quality. A role playing game set in a future of interstellar space travel, Mass Effect makes effective use of player choices and a lawful/chaotic alignment system all balanced with a class-based third person shooter combat system.The storytelling in the game is top notch  with memorable characters and many instances where player choice has a huge effect on the story's outcome. Many of these choice are also carried over into the sequel Mass Effect 2 as well as Mass Effect 3. It's rare that a game is conceived as a trilogy and even rarer when it turns out to be a masterpiece. If you've not played this game yet, you owe it to yourself to do so!			",511,204,20,89,71,8,100

												77/100If I'm completely honest, I do think this game is slightly overrated by most. Whilst is is a very solid RPG with lots of diologue, many well written characters and an array of explorable planets just there at your doorstep, I did feel as if the game was truely lacking in a good combat system as well as suffering from a truely aweful inventory menu. I also found that I got lost every now and then as the game lacks a proper navigation system, often making missions feel very tiresome as I wonder around not knowing  where to go. Other than that, this is a game definitly worth playing and I'm keen to get onto the second installment.			",34,5,0,4,2,0,3

												As someone who's more of a FPS player, I occasionaly like playing RPG's because of the immersive experience they deliver. I only played Fallout 3 and New Vegas aside from Mass Effect so I don't have much experience in these type of games but here goes. The number one reason I kept playing through Mass Effect was the story. The game really let's you control how the story develops while being very interesting at the same time. It was very hard to get in to (haha..) and can be overwhelming for someone who has never played an RPG before, but when you get the hang of the skills, guns and inventory it will be pretty fun. Although I have to say I don't like the combat apart from the usable skills. Yes, you have a plethora of options for your guns, but the guns themselves stay the same through out the game: pistol, shottie, rifle and sniper + grenades. Maybe because I liked the skills more I didn't like the gunplay that much. If you like modding your gun (attachments+ammo type) you probably would like this game but I liked the Fallout 3 weapon system more. The story blows you away and that's what counted the most for me. I liked doing side missions a lot more than combat, but that's me. TL;DR: Want a great story +♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of upgrade options + items (although they're pretty much the same items with better stats)? Buy this game.			",94,9,3,10,2,0,4

												Totally needed to re-write this review.Mass Effect, the first installment in what was to become Bioware's crown jewel and redefine the gaming communities understanding of dynamic decision making. Personally ME1 is my least favorite of the series but without a doubt it is still a wonderful experience that left me with fond memories and stuck with me throughout my gaming life. I am going to write this review as if describing it's pros and cons to somebody who has never heard of or played Mass Effect, so bear with me:The first part of what makes Mass Effect so perfectly immersive to the player is that they all but become Commander Shepard himself/herself, choosing their name, gender, appearance, history, combat style and how they react to their environment, in this the game has not only a very high immersion factor but an even higher replay factor as well, playing the game again and making different choices only to see how the world and it's characters react and how it will impact the story in the future sequels thanks to a very well-versed save transfer system.The gameplay is a third-person perspective utilizing a cover system for combat, and while this cover system is merely a pioneer for the much tightened cover mechanics in Mass Effect 2+3 it was still rather unique at the time and generally unexpected for an RPG title. By pressing ""space"" (I don't remember what the default key is, so I'm just assuming it's space) the player can take cover in the environment to reduce incoming fire. I found it to be a unique aspect at the time and I was more than a bit disappointed that it wasn't utilized further, but as I said ME1's cover system was a ""beta"" for lack of a better word and paved the way for the perfected combat systems in the sequels.Mass Effect's story is compelling, made even more so by the fact that you yourself are the famous Commander Shepard and it is up to YOU, not some pre-determined protagonist, but YOU to proceed through the invasive forces of rogue synthetic drones to chase down a defected Spectre and put a cork in the bunghole of his plans all the while accompanied by a cast of lovable, memorable and very well-rounded allies.Some aspects of gameplay however were not all that good and I felt were a blemish on what could have been an otherwise perfect game. And this flaw has a name, the Mako. The Mako is your supposedly ""trusty"" all-terrain vehicle that you utilize in every single mission to reach your objective before you and your chosen squadmates proceed on foot. To quit dancing around the issue: the Mako is a clumsy and thorough mess. It controls like an old shoe and it has a horrible habit of overreacting to the terrain, spiraling out of control and more often than it should flies into environmental hazards. For this reason I was ever so thankful that vehicle sequences have never been looked into again for the Mass Effect series.A secondary flaw was inventory management: Scarcely a single RPG game can exist without armor and weapons that you pick up in your travels, and of course Mass Effect has this function as well. But managing the inventory and all your loot feels like an afterthought on the developers end, with no filters to sort your items through it ends up being a tedious waste of time to decide what to keep, what to equip on who and what to convert to omni-gel (which is some magical lotion you rub on electronic locks to open doors and containers to find even MORE crap). Without the nightmarish inventory management and the over-glorified brick known as the Mako I would say that Mass Effect is a near-perfect game despite it's smaller flaws.So in conclusion: Mass Effect, while personally I feel being the least enjoyable of the trilogy, is a brilliant game put together by ingenious writers and programmers, and remains to this day the opening chapter of one of the most industry-changing and cultrally influential series' on todays market. If you haven't played Mass Effect yet I sincerely recommend giving it a go, and I can personally guarantee that you will not leave disappointed.			",143,30,0,14,4,2,3

												77/100If I'm completely honest, I do think this game is slightly overrated by most. Whilst is is a very solid RPG with lots of diologue, many well written characters and an array of explorable planets just there at your doorstep, I did feel as if the game was truely lacking in a good combat system as well as suffering from a truely aweful inventory menu. I also found that I got lost every now and then as the game lacks a proper navigation system, often making missions feel very tiresome as I wonder around not knowing  where to go. Other than that, this is a game definitly worth playing and I'm keen to get onto the second installment.			",34,5,0,4,2,0,3

												Mass Effect is quite simply an awesome game. It holds up well over time because of its story, though for a circa 2006-2007 title it still looks all right. There is quite a bit of detail, and the character models are distinctive if stiff by next-gen standards. But the story. As Commander Shepherd (there's a metaphor for you), you suspect an elite inter-galactic covert operative named Saren has gone rogue and is in league with - something - in some kind of nefrarious activity against the galaxy. Signs of this activity are indicated by the growing presence of the militaristic Geth civilization, an AI-driven robotic organization (more will be discovered about them as the game progresses). Shepherd is tasked with investigating Saren. Along the way, you'll uncover secret military bases, testing labs, strange alien creatures (not all of them hostile!) corrupted intergalactic politicians, and allies of the most unexpected sort. The game starts slowly. If you are hoping to get some shooting action right away, you do (The Prologue - Eden Prime). But once the Prologue is finished, the action devolves into a snooze-fest of non-combat missions on the Citadel. You'll want to do most if not all of them, as they are an easy way to level-up early in the game, but could leave some who are hoping for more action disappointed. If you can make it past the Citadel missions, you'll get your own ship and commence on the real adventures. There is the scripted main story, which involves visiting three or four systems (some only appear later in the game). There are what I'll call the Character side missions: if you talk to the crew on your ship, they'll share parts of their past with you, some of which will provide the option for additional missions. And there is the option to simply explore the galaxy. There are a large number of star 'clusters', each with multiple planetary 'systems' that hide many different artifacts and resources; the discovery of either gives you money or points toward leveling up or both. In each system there is at least one planet that can be landed on and explored using the armored Mako Rover. The pattern is quite similar for each landing: land, explore, fight (usually), then leave. Fortunately the terrain and environments vary between planets varies quite a bit, even if the older graphics don't allow much terrain detail. There are ice planets, desert planets, lush earth-like planets. Even thoug hyou are wearing an environmental bio-suit, not every planet is safe to explore on foot. There are some planets that are level 1 or level 2 hazards: stay out of the Mako too long, and you'll risk dying as hazard intensifies. Picking your squad is actually one of the tougher challenges of the game. For each mission - combat or exploration - you are allowed to bring two crew members with you to make up your squad. At its peak, you will have six crew members to choose from, each with a different skill set. Who you need depends on your mission. For planetary exploration, you'll want to take someone good in Electronics and Hacking to opening any encrypted containers you might find is easy, as well as someone good in combat in case you run into any trouble. Facing alien life-forms? Taking along one of the biotics experts along might be a good idea. They are not as good in a firefight as somebody with a better combat rating, so evaluate your risks carefully.While there are a wide variety of weapons available, they will all look different but every genre feels the same as you fire  -i.e. all assault rifles fire the same, sniper rifles fire the same, etc. The difference is in the amount of damage they cause, how large the recoil is, how long it takes for the weapon to over-heat. The weapon specification system is actually quite deep, with the ability to option and upgrade weapons with a variety of in-game add-ons that enhance some of the weapon's abilities for a trade-off (choose tungsten rounds for high damage, for instance, but the weapon will overheat sooner).Combat is quite simple, being of the point-and-shoot variety, with (on PC) right-clicking to aim. There is a 'snap to cover' that involves no hotkeys. Simply move toward cover, and your character will snap into cover. Right-clicking from cover allows you to aim and shoot from cover. Most of the time this works well - not brilliant, but well. There are the inevitable times that you will be running to avoid getting hit with toxic puke or something similar and you will snap to cover when you really don't want to - and you will die in the process. Save often.In the process of getting to know your crew, there will be options in conversation for meaningful exploration of feelings and events happening around you in the game. In two cases (perhaps more) there is an option to 'romance' the other character. Any kind of result here is only obtained after painstaking going through a large number of coversations and giving 'correct' answers to questions and issues. So if you're hoping for some quick R-rated video-game 'action', look elsewhere. Who you choose is entirely up to you.Which leads to one of the most important elements of Mass Effect's conversation game-play, and the key to its high replay value: choice. There are about a dozen places in the game where you are required to make a choice that will impact how the game progresses. While the core ending involving the fate of the galaxy may remain the same, how you get there has many circuitous routes. Who do you save? Who do you spare? Who do you kill? Do you engage in conflict, or try to talk your way out? Choice and consequence is felt through-out the game, and ever-present in the final third of the game - even after the final fight / battle is over, there is yet another choice to be made. Put all of this together effectively, which Mass Effect does, and you have an amazing Role Playing Game that will take you on an immersive cinematic ride that many games have trouble simulating, let alone achieveing at this level. Mass Effect is a Massive Achievement for RPG's that continues to hold its place in the RPG Hall of Fame, despite its age. Postscript on bugs: There have been reports of a variety of bugs with the PC port of this game. My game would crash upon loading save files; deleting the Shader Cache in the MassEffectConfig application fixed that (had to do it every time I loaded the game, but it was worth it). I also had the famous black-pixelated-block player textures on certain missions that only seems to afflict users with AMD processors. Fortunately there is an easy workaround. If you are having a problem with this game, search the internet. Chances are, you are not alone!			",308,121,22,53,56,2,74

												Of all the Mass Effect games, this is only one which can be considered a true RPG with all the standard RPG fare intact.While the other entries in the series do a good job of personifying the Good (ME2), the Bad (ME3) and the Ugly (Andromeda), the original Mass Effect is the most distinct of the series - focusing less on the combat and more on traditional RPG mechanics and exploration of the galaxy.Graphically the game still looks good, albeit for a game which came out in 2007, although the combat feels dated unless you are of the Biotic God persuasion - although it does have elements which were sad losses from subsequent games in the form of greater squadmate controls and using lots of powers.Most importantly for a Mass Effect game, the writing of Mass Effect 1 is in another plane of existance compared to the later offerings, although Mass Effect 2 is still well written, and the depth of world building and genuine diversity (OF PERSONALITY) and memorability of the squadmates is excellent.If you want a sci-fi RPG that's well written, with a universe that you can, and will, get sucked into and fall in love with then Mass Effect is for you. However, this is debatably the high point for the franchise and rather than loving you tenderly and settling down happily ever after, the series will sour later on and leave you with a nasty taste in the mouth if you follow it through to the conclusion.

												(Keep in mind that I have over 100 hours on Origin and another 100 hours on Xbox, with a total of 9 full playthroughs across all three games with plenty more playthroughs on the other games.)I have tons of games in my library and love most of them, I've been holding off reviewing a game until I really felt I understood every aspect of the game and done all there is to do. Mass Effect is my absolute favorite series and will be until my death, it is an amazing game and has a beautifully crafted storyline. In this review I will go into detail on most aspects of the game and will explain both the good parts of the game as well as the shortcomings of it. I will keep this review as spoiler free as possible as well.Storyline:Right from the beginning of the game, even in the character creation, you feel like you are really in this universe. It really immerses you into the world and lore of the game. As you play through the game the storyline may seem to slow a bit as you’re doing your side quests and exploration but it will always feel like you’re doing something to help advance personal storylines of people that will play some role in Shepard’s mission. As you play through the other games in this series these storylines arc out more and more and intertwine in ways that you wouldn’t imagine. It is truly the single best part of the game and completely makes the game.Gameplay:The gameplay can be sort of clunky at times, especially during fights. The cover mechanic is a nice feature and is prevalent in all three games but can be glitch and you can end up doing something that’ll get you killed on accident. Perhaps the single worst part of this game is the driving and exploring in the M35 Mako which is the car you’ll find yourself in very frequently. It is the only thing that makes me dread another playthrough. The control scheme for it is very clunky and takes a LOT of practice to eventually get down. Other than that, the questing and interaction with NPC’s feels very natural and seamless. Everything that happens is there for a reason and nothing really feels out of place.Graphics:For a late 2007 game the graphics are pretty much on par and there isn’t too much to praise or criticize. Personally I don’t pay much attention to graphics and care a lot more about storyline and gameplay. Even though the textures and graphics aren’t that good the lore and storyline more than make up for the lack of amazing graphics.Lore:The lore of this game is completely amazing and in-depth. There is so much to the lore in this game that even I, someone who has read three of the four books and read the codex multiple times, still doesn’t know everything there is to know. Everything that has happened in the game has some amount of information behind it. I could go on for hours about all the technology and alien races in the game but I intend to keep this review somewhat short. I honestly can’t explain everything there is, the only way to truly experience is to play it for yourself.Rating: 9.5/10 ",178,26,2,29,16,4,25

Planetary Exploration, a lot of decissions and... an unwilling hero.This game hardly needs any recomendation, it's a classic Hardcore Science Fiction Role Playing Game. It's done well, and the story is deep and immersive. I savoured every minute of gameplay.Dig your tusks, errrr teeth deep into it and have fun!I recomend this game, simple as this statement is.

												My hour count may be low on steam, but on 360 I've played 7 full playthroughs with and all achievements unlockedThis game is a modern classic. It was 7th gen's KotOR.Remarkeable voice acting, atmosphere and story.The universe is on par with stories like Star Trek and even Star Wars with clear inspiration from those universes. This is easily one of the best, if not THE best scifi RPG out there. Its a great series, if you exclude ME3.I'll sum up what makes this masterpiece great in a simple list fornPROS:-Great voice acting-Great characters and villains-Although the Reapers are somwhat generic ""ancient evils"" they're still very interesting-The fully voiced protagonist with two genders shows how much work they put into the dialogue and making it as emersive as possible.-leads into a great trilogy (excluding the second half of ME3)-all races are interesting with lore behind them-different planets and have their own culture and feel. Lower-Citadel is a robust cyberpunk-like underworld where anything goes while Noveria feels like the Hoth we never got to explore (until SWTOR came along)-the atmosphere throughout the game is strong. You really do feel like the captain of a spaceship, exploring the universe and learning new thingsCONS:-meh gameplay. Significantly improved in ME2-graphical glitches present in this version and vary between person to person (judging by community posts)-Kaiden is almost as bad as Alistair-A lot of your choices don't really matter. The game gives you the illusion of choice. It make impact ME2 somewhat, but the choices you make in ME1 and 2 make no difference whatsoever in 3-Male Shepherd in this game has a very wooden voice actor. Femshep does a much better job. Mark Meer improves his acting in ME2-Shepherd overall isn't a very interesting character after the 10 minute intro. You can choose his/her origin story which is great but it's only loosely referenced in the game and it doesn't make as much an impact as your origin does in Dragon Age: Origins (another great RPG by BioWare)-most of the time, you're only fighting Geth which is a shame since the galaxy is booming with much more life. It gets stale seeing the same model fall over and over when you could be fighting a limitless amount of different species. Some planets let you fight rachni and krogan but these moments are few and far between. It feels like wasted potential. Again, ME2 improves on this.To sum it all up, it's a flawed masterpiece. The atmosphere, story, and characters are fantastic but the ho-hum gameplay and wooden protagonist leave a lot to be desired. ME2 is an overall better game but this game remains my favorite in the series because it gives you a sense of curiosity and wonder that only few games manage to give me.8.5/10			",187,27,1,25,8,0,17

												The beginning of an epic saga! If you're not a fan already, then prepare to become one. In this well balanced RPG game, you call the shots as you lead a crack team of warriors on a mission to save the galaxy. The story is both engaging and intense, keeping you on the edge of your seat the whole way. Think carefully before making any decisions, as they can and will come back to haunt you in ME2 and 3. And prepare to get attached to your companions, as you may well lose them if you don't take care! While the gameplay itself can be buggy at times, it is incredibly intuitive given it was made in '07, though nowhere near as smooth as Crysis. For $20 you are getting something worth far more! So go ahead and download it! Yes I mean you, go ahead and click the download button! I can guarantee you won't regret it! And while you're at it, you might as well get Mass Effect 2, cuz you WILL be buying it after you get hooked on ME1. So save yourself the trouble and do it now. xD			",28,1,0,8,2,0,4

												Any fan of either science fiction or the RPG genre who hasn't played ME1 will most likely be delighted with it.  While the combat system can be quite clunky and a little frustrating at times, the story and overall gameplay experience easily place this game in my top 5.  I think the depth of the game world rivals that of The Elder Scrolls when the entire Mass Effect series (and all its codex entries!) is considered.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Of all the Mass Effect games, this is only one which can be considered a true RPG with all the standard RPG fare intact.While the other entries in the series do a good job of personifying the Good (ME2), the Bad (ME3) and the Ugly (Andromeda), the original Mass Effect is the most distinct of the series - focusing less on the combat and more on traditional RPG mechanics and exploration of the galaxy.Graphically the game still looks good, albeit for a game which came out in 2007, although the combat feels dated unless you are of the Biotic God persuasion - although it does have elements which were sad losses from subsequent games in the form of greater squadmate controls and using lots of powers.Most importantly for a Mass Effect game, the writing of Mass Effect 1 is in another plane of existance compared to the later offerings, although Mass Effect 2 is still well written, and the depth of world building and genuine diversity (OF PERSONALITY) and memorability of the squadmates is excellent.If you want a sci-fi RPG that's well written, with a universe that you can, and will, get sucked into and fall in love with then Mass Effect is for you. However, this is debatably the high point for the franchise and rather than loving you tenderly and settling down happily ever after, the series will sour later on and leave you with a nasty taste in the mouth if you follow it through to the conclusion.

												Perhaps the pinnacle of my experiences in the sci-fi genre. Something about the universe entraps me, making the world feel just believable enough while posing advances in science and sociology to retain the brilliance of science fiction. It gives a chance to make the character your own, with options that make you observe what you want to say, instead of having an idea of what will be 'good guy' or 'badass'. The universe offers a lot of reward for exploring and enterprise, making the game far longer than the set story.There are shortcomings obviously. The combat has slight hard-spots but its largely cooperative. Sometimes its worth saving before dialogue just to make sure you don't pick an option that you later find 'misleading'. Lastly, new OS's don't always get along with the game. I had to run Windows Software Troubleshoot to make it work, and afterwards the steam overlay stopped working.All in all, I encourage anyone who enjoys a game for its story and its gameplay, to fully immerse themselves in this series.

rating: worth buying at full pricescore: 7.5/10 - goodsimilar games: Deus Ex Human Revolution, Dragon Age Origins, Spec Ops The Linetags: RPG, character development, story-driven, relationships, dull gameplayI finally got the motivation to play Mass Effect. After so many years of praise for this franchise I just said to myself that I HAVE to at least play it for a fair amount of time. I tried playing this game some years ago but the extremely dull gameplay immediately turned me off and male Shephard isn't really interesting as a character. This playthrough I started as female Shephard (suggested by many people) and that really made the game more interesting, but before I talk about the good things I want to talk about the dull gameplay.I keep saying the word dull because that's the most fair way to describe it I think, because its not really ""bad"", but you have no decisions to do as a player, you don't have to use your brain, you just keep shooting. That does not mean that it cant be fun though, but for me it wasn't. Sometimes it was really annoying, sometimes it had its moments, sometimes is was just consuming my time. The game would really benefit if they would reduce the combat and focus on characters instead, but I guess you have to please the mass market. The problems with the combat are the following: Enemies are bullet sponges, sound design is bad, AI is terrible, you have no interesting abilities, only your squad has, and weapons are unsatisfying to use due to ugly recoil and bad hit feedback. Its not terrible, considering the age of the game, but it really drags the game down.Another bad thing are the side-missions which are nothing but filler, completely meaningless and a waste of time. Most of them are the same recycled levels with other objectives, but even the objectives themselves are just go from A to B, kill everything on your way and press the action button at the end. There were some side-missions where you interact with characters, but those are very rare and those interactions only go for a very short duration. I recommend skipping every side-mission, except the ones you do for your crew-members (not all of them have missions for you).The main missions were really fun though, you get to an area which could be a planet, a station, something which works as a hub area. There you meet characters and things happen and you get like mini side-missions from some people which are okay since they don't take much time and the character interaction is what makes this game fun.What I like about the main missions is that you stay at one big hub area for a long time and have to do different objectives to achieve something and get to different places. That reminded me a lot of Deus Ex, and it works almost as good as in Deus Ex. Exploring these places and meeting characters from different races is interesting and fun. Only thing which breaks this a little bit are the extremely annoying elevators, which probably are just there to cover loading screens. The thing is if they would just put a loading screen there it would probably load in seconds, cause today we have better PCs, but this game was mainly developed for consoles, so they didn't think about that. Still there are some PC specific things, for example you have extra keys assigned to each weapon and keys assigned to things like inventory and journal.The graphics are very dated, but character models still look fine, and overall the game still looks good thanks to very creative weapon and alien design. Animations are sometimes really bad, in most cutscenes the character are just standing in front of each other and moving their lips a little, but that's fine, because it still works. To the end of the game you can see that they put much more effort to the presentation and cutscenes and the story also gets really tense later, but expect a slow start and don't kill your motivation by doing filler side-missions. Also after every main missions you should talk to every squad member, you get interesting and fun dialouges and build relationships.I think this is a good game, but a little bit overhyped. People praise it for its story, for good reason, but forget the gameplay, or they just don't care about it, I do however. That's why I can't give it a very good score, but a 7.5 is still good in my book and definitely worth playing if you can handle dull gameplay.			",301,32,3,20,9,0,16

												A long long time ago in a galaxy far away...It was 2007, and Bioware launched their flagship title to the franchise we now know as Mass Effect.Was it worthy of praise and sequels? Does it hold up today?Yes, and yes.First of all, the universe is immense, with detailed lore written and performed via audio journals.(The games also spawned novelizations, merchandise, and a script for a movie has been in development since 2010)The game was among the first exploring morality, choice, and consequences can lead you down different paths.Aaaand here's where I lose some of you because of my opinion: I like the Mass Effect universe more than Star Wars universe, in fact, I am not much of a fan at all of Star Wars, not even the original trilogy. There, I said it.Did Star Wars inspire Mass Effect?Duh.I also like Doctor Who, Farscape, and other sci-fi worlds, and just take into consideration that a review is just an opinion.Ok anyone still with me?Why is Ashley Williams armor pink and white? It makes not one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bit of sense. She's a marine, not a sex robot. Sure, you can buy Ashley some upgraded armor and retire the pink-and-white ""whywouldanyonewearthisinabattlefieldwhiteisimpossibletokeepcleannottomentionitsjustplainsexistatthispoint""peice of armor to rest....BUT WHY??!?!?!So apart from a few minor gripes, the game still crafts its story well and creates interesting choices for Shepard to face (even though ""Renegade"" Shepard is kind of a psychotic♥♥♥♥♥♥for no reason)Final Verdict:7.5/10 - Definitely worth putting in your collection, with ME2. Pity we'll never get ME3, but just go watch it on Youtube because ♥♥♥♥ EA.And if any of you make a sci-fi space epic, don't put the girls in ""powderpuff"" fashion armor.10/10 girls prefer not being shot thanks to some sexist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the armory.

												9.8/10 so close to a 10...This is a defining moment in gaming history, and it deserves to be. As a third person shooter alone it's pretty good, but when you combine the RPG elements it becomes truly one of the best games I've ever played. Of course, that's just the start, throw in the epic storyline which really does change as you make decisions, the people you'll meet and places you'll see, and it becomes a genuinely unmissable series. Shape your character into either the world's most badassful, ruthless killing machine, or the by-the-book man of justice with just 3 solar cycles until retirement. Then import that character into ME2, or replay as a whole new shep.			",514,169,14,124,78,7,213

												Recommended but i couldn't like it because only one but also important part of a game.Honestly everything is good. Story, dialogues, main and side quests, RPG elements... except combat system.Combat system is nearly horrible, cover shooting mostly doesn't work. For example you're in cover, leaning to a wall... an enemy just came to your near, you can look but you can't both shoot or aim to him. Crosshair is deceptive, shooting feeling is bad. In the end, fighting with enemies isn't flexible and in the end your main character dies because of combat mechanics. I got it, the game mostly based on role-playing but shooter/combat part of the game really sucks.Also if you stuck at a point which has a cutscene, you can't skip that cutscene and it ends up watching the cutscene over and over again.I really liked the game, so far i really enjoyed Citadel mission, speaking with NPCs and exploring the place were awesome. But... that's all. In that condition, i'd like to see a tactical strategic combat system instead of a mediocre 3rd person action.Also cloud support (for save game files), Steam overlay (a.k.a. in-game) features AREN'T available.So, if you're like me who intented to start Mass Effect series just now, please consider to play it somewhere else before buy...

In the end, fighting with enemies isn't flexible and in the end your main character dies because of combat mechanics. I got it, the game mostly based on role-playing but shooter/combat part of the game really sucks.Also if you stuck at a point which has a cutscene, you can't skip that cutscene and it ends up watching the cutscene over and over again.I really liked the game, so far i really enjoyed Citadel mission, speaking with NPCs and exploring the place were awesome. But... that's all. In that condition, i'd like to see a tactical strategic combat system instead of a mediocre 3rd person action.Also cloud support (for save game files), Steam overlay (a.k.a. in-game) features AREN'T available.So, if you're like me who intented to start Mass Effect series just now, please consider to play it somewhere else before buy...

												I personally love this game but that's because I am a huge nerd about all the lore and stuff. Honestly the series is really only good for it's story in my opinion. Being able to choose all your characters actions and having them change the world around you just feels amazing. The gameplay is not the best but it's fun and can be basically skipped if you have the difficulty on casual and sprint through it. The PC port is a bit bad I would get the console version but it's tolerable.			",240,35,3,20,9,2,16

												True masterpiece , 9.6/10.     (100+ hours of game time but not on steam)     This game man... When Mass Effect 1 first came out I was really young and at that time I didn't really liked Star Wars and I thought they are the same thing (kinda). I was a bit prejudiced about it. One of my friends came to me and said ""Hey there is a game called Mass Effect it rocks"". I watched my friend playing it , I didn't really liked it. After some time I realized that many of my friends are playing it. I was like hey let's try it and bought the game. That might be the best decision of my entire life.       Many people doesn't like the first game they prefer second or third but personally I actually love them all equal but the thing is ME2 and ME3 are really simular while this one have different atmosphere , gameplay and more RPG elements actually. Every weapon you have is customizable , many different skills , tough combats. Almost every interaction with NPC's have different outcome which give you paragon and renegade( other games contain it too but lesser and many of them are quick time paragon / renegade events).Anyway this is ME 1 review not 2 or 3 so let's talk about it a little bit.  Graphics : Most of the time graphics look good but when you are talking to someone and camera focused to characters well characters faces are like kinda mud but it's not annoying or bad it's just aged a little but not a big problem.    Story / Music / Atmosphere / Characters: It's Bioware a game dude. Magnificent story maybe one of the best to start a trilogy like that.Unique , interesting NPCs with many dialogues and romances. Perfect osts and atmosphere I don't thing I can explain it with enough detail in this short review you have to play it to understand how strong osts and atmosphere combine with each other. 10 / 10    Gameplay: First of all I want to start with WEAPONS SYSTEM maybe the worst part of the game is weapon heat. With wrong upgrades your sniper can burn instantly and you have to wait a few seconds to cool it down and it's pretty annoying.Some enemies make your weapon heat stable at some point so you can't use those and if you are not soldier class you have few weapons to shoot so it just becomes pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ The skill system is perfect in my opinion. You have to use it at the right time if you are playing at harder difficulties and singularity at the right time may turn freaky combat to shoot em all game. It's not perfect but it's not that annoying.(they fixed it in the other mass effect games but game became more action based)      Mako: Maybe the most criticized thing in the game. The game is leaving you with galaxy you can explore and most of the time your best friend on those planets is MAKO. Your beloved machine of destruction.Let's say hmm Mako's physics are not working well , shooting can be annoying and controls are hard. I can't say much but I never hated it. Mako feels like overpowered sometimes but hey you are Commander Shepard.    Well here it is. The first game of the epic trilogy. Just before the Mass Effect Andromeda. I strongly suggest that you guyz buy and play this game. I can't express my feelings about this game in the review during that trilogy I cried , laughed damn I feel pity for video game characters. If you ask me it's a must have and don't worry about Mass Effect 3's ending. It's better with extended cut and trust me even without an ending this game is one of the best series I've ever played.           I hope Andromeda will surpass my expectations. Buy this game!           Shepard out.			",130,12,3,29,7,0,12

												I've waited so long to play this game, but I'm happy I did. Properly moded, at smooth framerate, Mass Effect took me on a fantastic journey like no other title has ever done. You'll feel proud to be human and inspired by the amazing and imaginative masterpiece BioWare crafted here. With almost 40 hours clocked in, I've completed almost all the side quests and finished the main story (and what a fantastic story it is). If you ever wanted to explore space, interact with alien races, discover uncharted worlds and fall in love with a living/breathing universe with rich lore; this is it. Mass Effect will deliver all of that and more. The only downside for me is that this is probably the last ME game I'll ever play on Steam, since the full experience and content is only found on Origins. Regardless, I'm looking forward to it.If you haven't played this game yet, and Sci Fi is you thing, do it. I believe you'll enjoy it.			",36,22,0,15,1,0,5

												Mass Effect is the first in a series of games where you play as Commander Shepard, the first first mate of the USS Normandy, who is given command of the Normandy after a devestating attack on the human colony of Eden Prime. Your mission is to investigate the alien race behind the attack and save the Galaxy. Without going into anymore detail, as I wouldn't want to ruin it for you. Mass Effect is one of my all time favorite video game series, as the story just draws you in. The characters give you some back story, and you can explore the homeworlds of several council races, as well as explore the galaxy in general with your ship. Choices you make effect the gameplay overall and can be carried from the First Mass Effect into 2 and 3. The game is played in third-person mode, has a magnificent story and is visually pleasing to play. The only criticism I have for this does not come against the game itself, but against Steam for not having Mass Effect 3. Due to a deal Bioware made, Steam will never have the rights to Mass Effect 3, which means you won't be able to get the full experience of the series on Steam. With that aside, this game is worth playing if you are a fan of video games.			",479,176,24,74,66,6,86

												Having completed this game once more, I am again reminded just how awesome it is. While almost universally excellent, its climax gives you the same adrenalin rush that any good movie or book gives you. Mass Effect is a game that gives its all to the player and stands as a tribute to how amazing computer/video games can be when creativity is more important than money.

												There is something magical, and intriguing, about Mass Effect. This being the first of the series that I have played, it's mixture of galactic exploration and your quest to save all organic life is a lot to take in. Not to mention that Shepard's conversation with Vigil, the Prothean VI, is definently one of my most memorable moments in gaming, for it's beautiful execution -- the somber music, the supposedly emotionless VI spilling out memories of the genocide of his entire race, and the way that he seems to be in a state of decay -- it all comes together to make an extremely touching and emotional dialogue. 10/10, would definitely recommend.

												Mass Effect is one of the most innovative games I have ever played! It's desision making system allows for missions and dialogue to play out your specific way without breaking immersion.Gameplay : Mass effect is not always desision making. There are parts of the game where third person gunplay is involved. The combat system is fine, but not the best. There is no specific key to take cover against obstacles, so you'll have to lean up against walls a lot to attempt to get into cover. Guns have unlimited ammo, but they do overheat. While this is fine by be, I feel that the game would be much more fun and exciting if the guns used actual ammo reserves, like its sequel. THe enimies where not very challenging, and at times can be annoying to have to fight.There is a massive amount of exploration in this game! But at a lot of times, it is easy to get lost. With no specific objective markers in game or on your map, you have to look for yourself for what to do next and and how to do it. I spent lots of time walking in circles trying to find an objective!Graphics: Graphics in this game are ""weak"" compared to modern graphics, but understandable due to the game being released in 2006-2007. The textures in the world are nice to look at, but when it comes to the character models, they look very poor. Even if you max out the graphical settings (which I did for the entirety of the game) they are flat, and lack any kind of smoothing/anti-alising.  Even though these flaws were present, it did not take away from the experience.Story: The story follows a military commander, named Shepard. You can customize your character, it's gender, and first name (although the first name does not really impact the game)  The game's story length is around 9-10 hours, if you are relitivelty fast at completing games. Although, if you take your time, and complete the side missions, I do believe that you'll go well over 16+ hours. This game also has a lot of replayability due to the many diffrent dialogue options, and paragon and renagade story paths.My Conclusion : Mass Effect is a game worthy of its critical acclaim. It tells an amazing story that most other games on the market can't accomplsih. While this game may not be worth 19.99 in the store, it is a must that you pick it up during a steam sale.7.8/10 ",59,8,0,4,1,0,1

												Originally played this on the PS3 when it came out in a set for the trilogy, and it's even better on PC. Pros: - Compelling and well written story; the story sets up the game's villains very well with a worthy payoff. There's a real sense of urgency and discovery. - Interesting characters that you'll inevitably end up caring about; if you don't at least like Garrus, you're lying to yourself.- Amazing video game world with a wonderful attention to detail; probably one of the best universes created in an RPG.- Decisions!; pretty self-explanatory, if you've heard of Mass Effect you most likely also know that you can make decisions that have an impact on the story and the relationships with your allies. While it's used in many games, it's not always done well, but Mass Effect does it beautifully. Cons: - Clunky-ish gameplay; this can probably just be attributed to the fact that the game is pretty old. - Forgettable sidequests; the first game always suffered from a massive number of fetch quests and generally uninteresting distractions.- Inventory management; need I say more? The cons that I've listed were fixed in Mass Effect 2 & 3. Verdict:While the UI and gameplay definitely show the game's age, Mass Effect is worth playing simply because of the story and world it sets up so well. There are very few games that have managed to hook me in the way the Mass Effect series has, and it's a very unique experience that I think every fan of the genre should have. If you can forgive the kinda clunky combat and inventory management, you'll be rewarded with an excellent RPG that you'll most likely fall in love with.			",100,16,0,9,10,0,5

												I know I'm like 6 years late with this review, but what the hell...Takes a while to get into, but if you're a fan of Bioware RPGs you'll know what you're in for. Solid RPG system with a plethora of side quests, weapon customisation and combinations, and a levelling system with more skills than you know what to do with.The storyline is good, although I would have preferred the main story missions to have taken place across more than 4 worlds. When the galaxy map has so many systems to explore, it can get a bit tedious without breaking it up with a story progressing mission.The one thing it took me a while to realise was that to get the most out of the game, you have to do your research. In other words, looking up the mission and conversation choice outcomes before actually doing them. This isn't ideal, as you end up basically reading the game in chunks and then playing them through. The most obvious example of this is choosing your starting character. After going with the default, I then did some reading around, discovered that femshep has superior voice acting, and that there were other backstories that I found more interesting. Luckily I discovered this only 3 hours in...The biotic powers are cool, I chose vanguard and do not regret a thing. The combo of pistol for long range, and shotgun with the biotic assault powers at close range was really enjoyable. I chose a backstory of a ruthless colonist, and unfortunately the game makes it hard to play as renegade without coming across as a complete ♥♥♥♥♥/jackass. I ended up with only slightly more renegade that paragon by the end, as some of the renegade decisions would result in missed opportunities in this game and the sequels.Oh and you can have sexytimes with an alien.8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The gameplay is sloppy for a cover based shooter and there are a bunch of bugs in the cover and camera mechanics. There are rediculously bad vehicle sections that don't fit with the rest of the game, resource gathering that feels like a chore, and the graphics were not very good when the game came out let alone now. Oh, and the inventory system is an afterthought forcing in some really crappy RPG mechics where they aren't needed. It's still well worth playing.Why?Because the story is incredible and you can load your choices into ME2 and later into ME3. Did I mention the story was incredible? Character based narrative is Mass Effect's bread and butter (that, and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ME3 ending that makes no sense). Seriously skilled story writing, voice acting, direction, pacing,  Also, a powergamer note, you really need to have a ME1 paragon save in order to get Jack and miranda to both stay loyal in ME2 (cause you need near 100% paragon to swing that trick). ME2 DLC removes this need tnough.All that said, I might still recommend watching some ME1 youtube clips and skipping to chapter 2 which has almost no problems on a techincal side and an equally good story.

												Originally played this on the PS3 when it came out in a set for the trilogy, and it's even better on PC. Pros: - Compelling and well written story; the story sets up the game's villains very well with a worthy payoff. There's a real sense of urgency and discovery. - Interesting characters that you'll inevitably end up caring about; if you don't at least like Garrus, you're lying to yourself.- Amazing video game world with a wonderful attention to detail; probably one of the best universes created in an RPG.- Decisions!; pretty self-explanatory, if you've heard of Mass Effect you most likely also know that you can make decisions that have an impact on the story and the relationships with your allies. While it's used in many games, it's not always done well, but Mass Effect does it beautifully. Cons: - Clunky-ish gameplay; this can probably just be attributed to the fact that the game is pretty old. - Forgettable sidequests; the first game always suffered from a massive number of fetch quests and generally uninteresting distractions.- Inventory management; need I say more? The cons that I've listed were fixed in Mass Effect 2 & 3. Verdict:While the UI and gameplay definitely show the game's age, Mass Effect is worth playing simply because of the story and world it sets up so well. There are very few games that have managed to hook me in the way the Mass Effect series has, and it's a very unique experience that I think every fan of the genre should have. If you can forgive the kinda clunky combat and inventory management, you'll be rewarded with an excellent RPG that you'll most likely fall in love with.			",100,16,0,9,10,0,5

The graphics were pretty good at their time, the story is grapplingly fantastic and the characters are charismatic as hell! One of the best RPGs ever made, developed by one of the best companies ever. Thank you, Bioware!			",50,7,0,5,0,0,1

												ME1 is by far one of the most engaging and beautiful games I have ever played. Every time I go back to play it, it only takes minutes before I'm completely lost in the Mass Effect universe.My only TINY, itsy bitsy gripe is the inventory system is archaic and clunky, but I'm used to it so it didn't bother me until I was tens of hours in and finally stopped and said...you know...this could be better.The characters are wonderful and I love to come back to the universe often.  Owned it and beat it on the Xbox360 and played for about 80 hours, and I loved it enough to buy it again on PC and start all over <3			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There is something magical, and intriguing, about Mass Effect. This being the first of the series that I have played, it's mixture of galactic exploration and your quest to save all organic life is a lot to take in. Not to mention that Shepard's conversation with Vigil, the Prothean VI, is definently one of my most memorable moments in gaming, for it's beautiful execution -- the somber music, the supposedly emotionless VI spilling out memories of the genocide of his entire race, and the way that he seems to be in a state of decay -- it all comes together to make an extremely touching and emotional dialogue. 10/10, would definitely recommend.

												Mass Effect is one of the most innovative games I have ever played! It's desision making system allows for missions and dialogue to play out your specific way without breaking immersion.Gameplay : Mass effect is not always desision making. There are parts of the game where third person gunplay is involved. The combat system is fine, but not the best. There is no specific key to take cover against obstacles, so you'll have to lean up against walls a lot to attempt to get into cover. Guns have unlimited ammo, but they do overheat. While this is fine by be, I feel that the game would be much more fun and exciting if the guns used actual ammo reserves, like its sequel. THe enimies where not very challenging, and at times can be annoying to have to fight.There is a massive amount of exploration in this game! But at a lot of times, it is easy to get lost. With no specific objective markers in game or on your map, you have to look for yourself for what to do next and and how to do it. I spent lots of time walking in circles trying to find an objective!Graphics: Graphics in this game are ""weak"" compared to modern graphics, but understandable due to the game being released in 2006-2007. The textures in the world are nice to look at, but when it comes to the character models, they look very poor. Even if you max out the graphical settings (which I did for the entirety of the game) they are flat, and lack any kind of smoothing/anti-alising.  Even though these flaws were present, it did not take away from the experience.Story: The story follows a military commander, named Shepard. You can customize your character, it's gender, and first name (although the first name does not really impact the game)  The game's story length is around 9-10 hours, if you are relitivelty fast at completing games. Although, if you take your time, and complete the side missions, I do believe that you'll go well over 16+ hours. This game also has a lot of replayability due to the many diffrent dialogue options, and paragon and renagade story paths.My Conclusion : Mass Effect is a game worthy of its critical acclaim.

												Mass Effect was Bioware's attempt to create a new breed of RPGs. The cinematic RPG. In doing so they abandoned much of what is usually associated with a Bioware RPG and replaced it with this attempt at creating a ""movie"" feel for the game.The result is far from that however, the storyline is standard Bioware but the new dialog wheel introduced to tell it is a garbled mess that doesn't always reply the way you want it to and this takes heavily away from the connection you usually feel with the main character of an RPG.The gameplay and combat seems like a sci-fi Oblivion style but this was not a good combat system to begin with and the extremely small and linear maps of Mass Effect makes progression feel rather dull.Perhaps my favorite part of Mass Effect, and the only part I feel was up to Bioware's usual quality, was the backstory of the universe the game is set it. Very high quality.Overall this is a mediocre game to me. A game that tries to deliver an ""experience"" but fails.			",980,332,42,138,118,11,215

												Mass Effect 1 is not as good as second part, but it is still a very good RPG and if you have the Mass Effect pack on Steam, I recommend to play these games gradually, because then you will understand better to the storyline in the second part. So as I said, the story is very good but it is worse in controls, for example driving in your vehicle is very annoying because of dull control. I have been disappointed too that you can't finish side quests after the end of game like in second part. But it really worths playing.			",165,41,10,15,23,4,29

												Definitely recommed! I must confess that this was my first shooter, and the fact that I'm currently scouring Steam for other notable shooter games should say something about Mass Effect. It's amazing. It's addictive. It's easy enough for someone like me who prefered RPGs to catch on. The fact that Shepard's story continues through to the next two games doesn't faze me at all, in fact it just means that I don't have to say goodbye to a character I've grown to like. I've also started to have very strong opinions on which weapons manufacture I like best, and am a bit disappointed that in this game at least, we couldn't bang the other alien teammates.

												Got the Mass Effect pack for $10, including the original and ME2. I don't feel too bad I missed playing this back in 2008; overall, I'd give it 8/10.The game's already been praised by plenty of people, so the bad:Controls are not optimized as well as they could be; navigating dialogue options and the hacking minigames are very annoying with the mouse.The game is short. When some of the characters in your party start referring to a bond being created, and I'm only 6 hours into the game, the story feels a little rushed.Overall, this was $5 very well spent, but there's no way this game was worth full price.

												An Open Letter to Toolbear:Dear toolbear, It has come to my attention that after all this time, since you first made fun of me for being dead on the internet, you have not said you're sorry. You should understand that this lets me, a dead guy on the internet, understand a lot about the person that you are (notice how I said person, not bear, you are not a bear you are a person on the internet and you need to come to terms with reality). From your actions I can tell that your average day consists of two things: 1) Wake up and jack off to furry bear porn and 2) Go to your computer and make fun of openly dead people on the internet. Now, keeping that in mind, lets see what I do with my day. The format will be the action followed by an explanation. Here is my day: 1) Wake up (yes dead people need sleep too if you didn't think that you're racist and should see a psychiatrist and shut yourself off from society) 2) Shower (see item 1 explanation) 3) Solve cold fusion (Ever since I died I have put 100% of my ghostly being into helping society, the fact that you are mean to me on the internet shows that you are worthless as a person (again I said person)) 4) Give the solution to everyone for free (see item 3 explanation) 5) Cure AIDS (You of all people should be interested in this item) 6) Give the cure to everyone for free (notice how you have not gotten the cure to AIDS, this is because you are no longer a person, you are less that dirt) 7) Bring about world piece (notice, again, that you have not seen this piece. This is because you do not deserve to see it, you are less than dirt) 8) Solve all the world's remaining problems (This is because I am a good creature, I am actually worth something, unlike you). I would hope that this list of my every day actions would change your mind when it comes to respecting dead people on the internet (like me), but I would not expect you to, because you are of absolutely no use to anything in this universe whatsoever. Unlike this game. Mass Effect has brought me some solace from your relentless attacks on my being. If it were not for this video game, I would have probably given up on helping this universe. Look around you (if you are not toolbear) and see all the good that this game has done to this world. I would highly recommend buying this game if you like RPGs and science fiction. 9/10-[M8B] Jamestown (A dead guy on the internet)P.S. ♥♥♥♥ you toolbear			",97,14,2,10,6,1,5

												I will give this game 7/10. The gameplay is quite decent, the difficulty seems fair MOST of the time.The things that holds me from giving it a higher score is very anoying bugs.1. You can get stuck in the elevator forcing you to reload the last save points.2. There is a part where if you are hit you get stuck and you are forced to reload a check point.3. The textures are extremly low quality and to get good quality you are forced to change the game files manualy.The auto saves are also horrible, they have made me waste probably 40 min of my life since i was forcedto go back a long time after dying.The port to Steam is so freaking bad, the DLC is forced to be manualy downloaded from EA's site and i can't even find the second DLC. The fact that Bioware just let bugs like these still be there is mind blowing, they just don't care about their game anymore and won't fix gamebreaking bugs. The fact that Steam didn't make the DLC available to the Steam client itself is also confusing.But other than that the game is fun to play, im looking forward to play the rest of the Mass Effect series.

												Definitely recommed! I must confess that this was my first shooter, and the fact that I'm currently scouring Steam for other notable shooter games should say something about Mass Effect. It's amazing. It's addictive. It's easy enough for someone like me who prefered RPGs to catch on. The fact that Shepard's story continues through to the next two games doesn't faze me at all, in fact it just means that I don't have to say goodbye to a character I've grown to like. I've also started to have very strong opinions on which weapons manufacture I like best, and am a bit disappointed that in this game at least, we couldn't bang the other alien teammates.

 Originally posted on June 28, 2010 Mass Effect is essentially the cross-breed result of mating Bioware's RPG formula with Gears of War's combat system.The game is a console title first and foremost, which makes many of its flaws all the more apparent on the PC, however the art design, and story telling are top notch, and the roleplaying elements (through not as deep as the game would like you to think) are interesting enoughGraphics- The game features dated graphics technically speaking, even for the original release date. Incredibly low poly models, low res textures, and mediocre effect (particles) make this game less than awe inspiring visually. However the art design and character models are generally pretty good, especially when in comes to aliens, geth, and other creatures. The animations look quite good, and generally the art design is very creative. Cutscenes look quite good, generally speaking, although the overuse of bloom sometimes is annoying.Yet the game is clearly custom tailored for the 5-year-old hardware of consoles, with irritatingly frequent load screens, jarringly low res skyboxes and other textures, and annoying amounts of loading zones masquerading as elevators.Sound- Generally speaking, the music is superb, with a electronica soundtrack that harkens back to deus ex. The voice acting is also generally good, although there are a few rough spots, and the characters are generally memorable as a result. The sounds for weapons and other effects are also quite nice, providing a space age feel to the combatGameplay- My biggest problem with this game by far is the gameplay, as Bioware seems to have taken their typical RPG formula (which I have mixed feelings about) and mated it with Gears of War's cover and combat systems ( which I hate). Bioware's formula allows for alot of choices in the story, randomized loot drops, and other RPG staples. It is also notorious for lazy level design. absolute cookie cutter carbon copies of levels litter this game, quickly draining what little flavor the side quests hold for you from the game, as there is one generic mine level, two generic settlement levels, and one generic spaceship/station level that the player encounters AGAIN AND AGAIN throughout the game. At least Bethesda knows their level design, give them credit for that. Bioware's level design flat out sucks.It doesn't end with cookie cutter levels however, for the driving sequences are equally frustrating. Exploring strange new worlds in a rover and finding hidden collectibles (tedious, but an RPG staple) along with side quests sounds fun in theory, but the Mako handles like a physics nightmare. In addition, some of the terrain is modeled with so few polygons and so extremely steeply that it is almost impossible to simply cruise around the planets. Instead the mako climbs impossible angles, flips and does barrel rolls (without taking damage of course) and gets caught on terrain. In addition, the turret has almost no traverse, and you only get half xp from kills in the mako, making the armaments almost useless. Driving quickly became on absolute nightmare for me, and I was using a mouse and keyboard. I can only imagine how those poor saps with controllers felt.Third, the cover system is awful and unnecessary. I hate gears of war, or any third person cover shooter for that matter, on principle. So seeing this system in a game made by people who used to develop RPG's for the PC first is awful. It locks you into objects unnecessarily, makes it difficult to get out, and frequently got me killed, frustrating me to no end. It also leaves levels littered with absurd amounts of cover for you and your enemies to use. Not that this unrealistic feature mattered, as the favorite maneuver of most of the AI in the game is to charge straight at your guns.Other features such as the leveling, perks and squad management worked better, but even those got clunky. For example there is no way to examine your crew member's stats while on the Normandy, so equipping them via the weapons lockers can be very confusing. Inventory management in general is clunky, and needs a menu that is actually designed for the PC. Finally, I found the fact that every member of your squad had one of each weapon, even if they weren't trained in its use, to be very odd, and the fact that armor and weapon stats were not tied to the model or skin of the item gets very confusing. The loot often felt... generic at best.Ultimately, this game has a story that will draw you in and it can be a lot of fun to play, but it is full of irritating gameplay, so much so that I would almost recommend skipping all but a select few of the side missions. It has a large amount of replay value, with many classes available to play as and many ways to resolve a situation, (although not as many as you think, 2 dialog choices often result in Shepard saying the same exact thing, a false representation of a choice), and it will keep you playing for many hours. Just take it for what it is: Consolized.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mass Effect 1 is not as good as second part, but it is still a very good RPG and if you have the Mass Effect pack on Steam, I recommend to play these games gradually, because then you will understand better to the storyline in the second part. So as I said, the story is very good but it is worse in controls, for example driving in your vehicle is very annoying because of dull control. I have been disappointed too that you can't finish side quests after the end of game like in second part. But it really worths playing.			",165,41,10,15,23,4,29

However, where this game really shines is in the exceptional setting and story. The world and characters in Mass Effect draw you into an immersive experience that will leave you demanding more. And you can get more with ME2 and ME3, both of which are also brilliant games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Got the Mass Effect pack for $10, including the original and ME2. I don't feel too bad I missed playing this back in 2008; overall, I'd give it 8/10.The game's already been praised by plenty of people, so the bad:Controls are not optimized as well as they could be; navigating dialogue options and the hacking minigames are very annoying with the mouse.The game is short. When some of the characters in your party start referring to a bond being created, and I'm only 6 hours into the game, the story feels a little rushed.Overall, this was $5 very well spent, but there's no way this game was worth full price.

												Mass Effect makes my heart flutter everytime I put it on.  It has such a vibrant galaxy to explore, great story and beautifully fleshed out characters. The choices you make have minor to major consequences throughout the game world and subsequently affect the 2 following games. 1 playthrough is close to 40hrs if you spend a lot of time exploring, though in a mass effect game 10 hrs of gameplay has more content than most games clocking over 100hrs, they have a real feeling of forward momentum and the pacing between quests or side quests never come across as feeling obtuse. I did my first playthrough on the 360 as a  infiltrator class paragon and my 2nd on p.c as an adept paragon,  even though I was a paragon both times the game was different  on my 2nd playthrough due to different choices made. I plan on doing even another playthrough  as a renegade, which I'm very excited about because I don't have any idea how it's going to play out due to major choices that can be made. I recommend on either platform but the p.c version does have slightly better graphical quality and they really tightened up the controls with the keyboard and mouse. This game feels like a lot of love, care and pride went into it and it shows, this game deserves to played.  ",235,77,3,29,14,2,13

Replay value is extremely high. If you do not like the gameplay of ME1 (I do) I suggest you push yourself to finish it with as many side quests as you can, because your actions carry on to the other 2 games.

												This game is great, not the best, but it is certainly one of the better games on Steam. It has aged rather well, and while a few aspects of it are very dated and can be annoying, such as the MAKO or hacking minigames, but the rest of the game such as the story, combat and voice acting (save for a few VERY minor cases) has aged rather well. There are a few graphic issues here and there however, but these can be overlooked or fixed within the game via the console.All in all I'd highly suggest this game! Solid story, great action and a lore-rich universe make for an awesome time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So I hadn't ever finished Mass Effect until just a few days ago but in those few hours that it took me to play the game through I thoroughly enjoyed it. The combat is fun, the story engaging, the graphics were fine and, overall, it felt like I WAS Shepard. The biggest compliment I can give this game is the story. It draws you in and absorbs you as you talk to all of these strange and fascinating characters and learn more about them and the worlds around them.I do have some problems with it though. One of those problems stemming from the fact that, when I first started playing this game, I had no idea where I was supposed to go. The game doesn't always present a clear direction and, while I do appreciate the fact that the map lets you set your own waypoints, it just doesn't direct you the way you would like.My biggest gripe with this game however comes in the form of combat. I do enjoy the combat of Mass Effect and it does keep you engaged but the controls are just not quite up to par. Mashing your face into the wall to take cover is not a good way of getting into cover. The later games in the series do this in a better way by mapping it to a button but here I often found myself just running against the nearest rock to get to cover and if that didn't work I would just run to the next one and so on and so forth.That being said this game is still excellent. The story is intriguing and the characters just enhance that. I recommend playing this if just for the story and nothing else. In fact, this game is worth a playthrough just for Garrus Vakarian alone. He is the man.			",380,71,8,79,18,2,46

 Mass Effect lemme start with this preface. I am not reviewing this game from my first or even second playthrough, This was in fact my fourth (My game time is only from PC i played this first on Xbox 360) now from that i am assuming that you maybe able to tell that i liked this game alot. Ps. finished the whole trilogy and to this day ,in my opinion, the best damn series of games to ever come out   (screw andromeda dosen't count). Ps. This review may contain spoilers for people you meet in the main story (Only main characters) Gameplay: This game has its ups and downs with its combat system. it is really clunky by today's smooth standards but back in 2007 (Xbox 360) or 2008 (PC) it was about standard for the time. The leveling system in ME 1 was by far the best in my opinion, the better array of abilities available for you to spec into felt better than it was in later installments of the trilogy. overall for a game of its time it feels polished enough to be really enjoyable but just a little far out from preference (Your milage may vary on this opinion)Characters: Mass Effect has probably my favorite cast of characters in anything. period. all of the main cast of characters are all memorable and they all have a certain place in my heart. From Commander Shepard, Your player made character to the preaching Elcor on the Citadel*, seriously i have never seen a community react to characters the way the Mass Effect community does. to put it into one word it's mesmerizing.Story: for all that's it's worth the story in this only needs a short piece. It started a trilogy, then a spin off, And ALL of the thousands of hours that the community have put into making their own stories in this incredible universe that BioWare created. But for actual reviews sake: The story has its ups and downs, these being the fact that everything on the citadel is amazing story with some pretty good writing and i would say that 90% is excellent but it's just Feros that gets me, i can't explain it. it just feels like the planet had nothing going for it and it was just a helpless 'go here and help people' quest. but apart from one mission it's incredible.Overall: In conclusion the adventures of you and your crew in the Mass Effect Universe will most likely be one of the best you'll ever Experience in your life (Virtually, of course), and with all of the points that I have talked about above this game is a must buy for Gamers and perhaps people who are willing to try something new to enjoy why people say that Games aren't just shoot 'em ups. *This Elcor can be called and I quote 'A big stupid jellyfish' its pretty funny.Ps. i guess that i need to mention what Mass Effect may be known for.

												Best ♥♥♥♥-in sci-fi game ever, Best Mass Effect game. Unlike the other two games it actually felt like a sci-fi rather than a coated James Bond movie. Shame that Bioware ended up in EA's bed, because what could have followed this game could have been 10x better than what got produced.If you're wondering why this game is better? Play it. I'll give you some hints1. It's actually an RPG - Something Bioware forgot in its sequels is giving the player choices that actually matter, in this you can truly feel like you're choosing your own path rather than having it forced on you2. The Reapers - At this point, we didn't know much about the reapers, but that's why they were such a great plot point: because they were mysterious. Perhaps it would have been better that way, keeping the player in the dark about them while fighting them. Mass Effect 2 kind of lost the feeling that the Reapers generated and by Mass Effect 3 they pretty much took a back seat the ♥♥♥♥ing Cerberus3. It gives you a villain to rally around - We all hated Saren, not because he was a bad character but because he was a bad guy, and he did that so well. Harbinger just assumed control of people, we had very little interaction with him. 4. Feels like an actual epic sci fi - What the sequels tried to do and failed is to keep the story epic while making it also feel like a summer thriller... bad move. Mass Effect throws environments at you that are really alien, combined with its freaky techno music that haunts you to the core. Sure, you often get the generic mountain planets, but I think they managed to make it work somewhat, and on that note5. Exploration - I get it, this isn't the U.S.S. Enterprise, you're hunting a criminal, but that doesn't mean you can't have a look around while you're out and about. You get to read up on strange planets, (the galaxy map usage in this is better too), explore them in a hilariously buggy tank, and do whatever you want. They are empty, for the most part, but it still feels fun. ME2 kind of continued it, but the lack of vehicular exploratation (sans the hammer) really didn't give the same vibe. Don't get me started on resource hunting in ME3There's a bunch of other stuff I didn't touch on. Is it perfect? Hell no, it definitely has flaws, but I rather would have seen them get fixed instead of axed in the second game. It's really quite sad.♥♥♥♥ you EA			",97,8,0,11,4,1,5

												(Recommended for the epicness and Asari love)Mass Effect would have to be one of most visionary and consistant RPG series made in recent years. Testament to the depth and intricacy of the game and its world, I have beaten this game and its sequels several times. Each time, I have made different choices and experienced different events and even different outcomes. With the benefit of hindsight, choices made in Mass Effect drive events found in its sequels.If comparing this first game to the rest of the games, it is reasonable to say that it is clunkier for sure, and it isn't the best version of the game out there. But problems can be persevered with. TextMOD can fix the textures of a certain Turian character, at least; and an INI edit can do the rest, particularly enabling 5.1 sound. However, once this is done, Mass Effect is perhaps the most memorable of the series for the wonder it inspires as an introduction to this rich universe and inspiring characters.Bear in mind, however, that if you wish to use a game-pad, you will require an external mapping program, and there are some irritating quirks with mapping mouse movements to the stick. In Xpadder, I had to add a middle mouse click to all directions. See my guide and downloadable profile. ;)Mass Effect was a revelation when it came out, and even know, though so much of its gloss has faded, it is mostly due to the rest ofthe trilogy being so fantastic in comparison. This entry to the story is mesmerising in its depth and clarity of execution. There has never been a more complete science fiction world ever invented for a video game.			",159,25,3,22,1,0,3

												This game is a must if you either enjoy story rich games or TPS.It is an old game and has some places where it shows, but it's definitely worth trying it out.(Once you meet Liara it definitely gets easier, I promise)The game itself is stellar, but also the experience in this game is crucial to play the rest of the series, which are one of the best games that filled me with excitements and emotions, and made me think deeper about the world around me than I ever did in real life.

												It's one of the best RPGTPS from 2008. This game has a great storyline, characters, detail & setting, and Mass Effect shows it. I would play this on PC/PS3 or Xbox 360 and never get tried of Mass Effect. It's out now on Standalone PC DVD, Steam, Origin, PlayStation Store, PS3 Disc (Mass Effect Trilogy Versions) or Xbox 360 Disc (Standalone & Mass Effect Trilogy Versions).But the Version of Mass Effect I like the most, is the HD Version on the PS3.

												One of my favorite games of all times. I played it on the 360. One of the reason why I like steam is i get to play my old favorite gamesand get them at a really great price. What sucks is this PC version of Mass Effect was great and all until I got to Numeria's 15 garage and every character and object is black fuzzy blotches. I usually expect most games to go to♥♥♥♥♥♥anyways, cause the gaming world has gotten a lot less reliable. So I do recommend this game on the 360. I will not recommend a broken game. I even went a couple saves back to restart it, didn't work.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is amazing! It could have been a movie because the story is awesome! Even if you don't play games you can play this one on the easiest difficulty just for it's story-- well, if you like science fiction, that is... It's very addictive. It makes you want to see what's next. There is even a ton of information that you can learn about the game's  fantastic world. Lots of new technologies and species and stuff like that. There are three main combat styles that you can use-- weapons, ""tech"" abilities and ""biotic"" abilities, which are new ways to manipulate the matter and the energy, kind of like the Force in Star Wars. There are six classes that you can play and each one has its strengths, weaknesses and unique set of skills and you have to work together with your followers to beat every kind of enemy. Each one of your followers has their own personality and story and some of them even give you a small quest to play. Many times you will be given the chance to make a choice between two or more decisions to take, usually a ""good"" one and a ""bad"" one. You can be a ""good guy"" or a ""bad guy"". Well, not really a *bad* guy... You save the galaxy either way, you can just choose to do it the right way, or any way you like. Even when talking to a character you can choose a ""good"" polite response or a ""bad"" rude one. What i didn't like is that all the weapons and any kind of equipment look and function alike. Even their names are boring (for example Lancer III, Lancer IV, Avenger VIII, Avenger IX, etc...) It would have been a lot better if there were unique items with a unique way to function and even special abilities, like for example a ""Prototype Alpha Bio-Blaster"". Also the planets you can explore get a little boring after a while. Another thing i didn't like is that there is no stealth, so you always have to fight your enemies. Except of course if you talk them out of it-- there is a way to persuade other characters using ""charm"" or ""intimidation"". You could also find it a bit annoying that your enemies always repeat the same thing during a battle (""Enemy is everywhere!"") and there are some technical problems too, but if you can overlook that, you have a damn good game with an excellent story that will bring you many hours of fun.

YouTube™ Video: Mass Effect -  Menu Theme 

			Views: 150,658		

			Add ""repeat"" between ""youtube"" and "".com""﻿ on the link. IF you want it to repeat. As ""arbiterV2"" user has commented. Awesome song from Mass Effect on main menu!!		

The series original shows it age in its visuals and many of its gameplay systems.  The clunky inventory and RPG shooting randomization will feel very outdated by today's standards.  However, the plot holds up well mainly to the now iconic characters and quality voice acting.  The game's formidable length may stand against it at this point as a way to catch up on the 'Mass Effect' backstory.Note: EA is my current employer, but I have not worked on any 'Mass Effect' title.

												I think I spent more time in this game learning about history, talking with aliens to learn their culture and admiring the vista than actually doing the main story quests.The game is actually quite short if you just follow the main story but I am kind of a completionist so it took me ~40 hours to finish I guess.I will not go on and on, since there are excellent critics, but even without considering the sequels this game is worth playing and made me jump on the second opus shouting ""Encore !""tl;dr: great story, great art, great side content, original and fun combat system.

												What is Mass Effect?Is it a good, combat-centered RPG, fun to play and rewarding? Can it be recommended?Certainly yes.Is it the best of best, a masterpiece of gaming, the holy grail?Sorry all you fanboys'n girls out there, it certainly is not.Pro:+ very clever level design, obviously done by some veteran console developers+ interesting combat, a little bit too arcade for my taste, but its a console game+ amazing setting, citadel station is better than anything Star Wars; the whole universe and lore is much better than Star Wars+ because of the level design and always changing approach, it doesnt get boring. just keep planetary exploring to a minumum.Contra:- characters are stereotypes and VERY superficial, I didnt care for anyone of them, hero included.- SUPER PREDICTABLE plot, outright boring, but thats some kind of trademark of Bioware games- shoddy teammate AI and pathfinding, I know a couple games that did this WAY better two years earlier- planetary exploring is very long-winded and gets boring at some point- surprisingly many glitches and gamebreaking clipping issues, I got stuck (damn you elevators!!!) or fell through the map more than a dozen times during one playthrough, so SAVE OFTEN- in more than 50% of all dialogs I disagreed with all dialog choices. guess I wouldnt make a good intergalactic soldier at all.Despite the many cons, the setting and lore is maybe the best in science-fiction gaming to date, which makes me recommend this game.It is well worth the 2,50 on sale. 10 bucks... I dunno			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pros:- Good story- Memorable characters- Combat can be fun- Abilities are actually usefulCons:- [major] Exploring is too slow, Shepard runs slow, Mako is slow, it's a big problem in a game like this- [major] Questionable design choices, like there is one side quest that makes you destroy 8 terminals each in 3 bunkers one by one and it's just a waste of time- Some backtracking- There is no way to know if a side quest will have an impact in the game, something happens because you didn't complete quest#58371, who would've known, I didn't even know that quest existed- [minor] Some enemies are really annoying (2 chargers and that Geth mobile turretish thing)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I never really hopped onto the train of Mass Effect fans when the Mass Effect series first got popular because I couldn't really see why it had so much popularity. I feel bad for doubting this game.Gameplay in Mass Effect is typical to any sort of RPG by Bioware. The gameplay is a blend of dialogue and talking to people, third person shooting and exploring tons of different planets in tons of different galaxies. I was amazed by the shear size of Mass Effect, 8 different galaxies with around 5 or more in each and each planet feels unique and I don't think it is just a copy and paste of different planet. The character customization of Commander Sheppard, even though it's limited in some areas, I find is well done where you can customize your appearance to make him be as ugly as you want and you can even customize his backstory. What makes the character customization of backstories even better is that characters will have different dialogue responses depending on your choice of backstory. Most of the gameplay feature are good but I do have a couple of complaints. The third person shooting mechanics aren't that well done. They aren't terrible, they aren't on the scale of being unplayable but it feels like the third person shooter segments were just added in as an after thought and it took me alot of getting used to. The second and final problem I have with the gameplay is the karma system. One thing that I'm not too fond of in RPGs (despite RPGs being my favourite genre of video games) is the karma systems some off these games have) I like to build my character, now knowing if the choice that I just made was good or bad or Ilike to make a bad choice if I'm in abad or annoying situation without an affect on my karma. Because in these games I find it way too easy to be the good guy and way too easy to be the bad guy.I just like to be the character that I build my character up to be. Apart from those 2 complaints there aren't really any other complaints I have about the gameplay.The story in Mass Effect is that you play as the main character Commander Sheppard, who you can customize hisappearance and even his backstory. He joins up with a crew lead by Captain Anderson. His crew is given a task to procure a military beacon on the planet Eden Prime. However, after a disaster, involving one of the crew mates dying by the hands of a rogue spectre, who are the protectors of the council, the crew ends u failing. After providing evidence to the council that this spectre has gone rogue,it is up to Commander Sheppard and his crew to bring the rogue spectre down to justice. This general idea of a plot has been done alot but Mass Effect throws enough twists and turns in the story to make it seem unique.Graphics in Mass Effect are OK but could be better. While the game looks, in general, good, there are several graphical bugs and awful looking textures and slow loading textures which definately hold the game back. Sound is really good. There are creative sfx for sci-fi related objects that I wouldn't have even thought of which fit in excellently.This game will have you consumed for hours, I'm still busy exploring the galaxy and discovering all sorts of new stuff. There is also replay value in this. You will want to play the game again and try different dialogue choices, try and see if you can solve a problem either calmly, declaring war or see if you can find another creative way to solve a situation.Mass Effect is a gem of a game that I reccommend to litterraly anybody that enjoys either SC-FIs or RPGs and if u fit in this category, this game is a must have.Pros+ Great gameplay+ Great twists in the story+ OK graphics+ Fantastic sound+ You will be playing this for hours+ Reaplay valueCons- Third person shooter segments are clunky at times- Slow loading texturesFinal verdict: 9/10Steam Curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Mass Effect Trillogy are the best games I've ever played. All three games are Singleplayer, 3rd-Person-Sci-Fi-Shooters with a.. restricted open world.ME 1 hasn't nice gameplay or graphics and it seems to be extremely boring at the beginning, but after You became interested in the story it's gettin more amazing with every mission You acomplish. The Story seems rather simple (Commander Shepard hunting a renegard ""Spectre"" who controls a Robot Army) but becomes more twisted. Your character can be designed as You want him/ her to look like, You can choose between 6 different Classes (i.e. Soldier, Infiltrator, Tech, etc.) but the best of all: Choices can be taken in almost every dialogue and whereby the story line can be changed. You can build relationships to crewmembers and decide to play as paragon or renegard. Although the synchronisation, the graphics and gameplay dont reach the average but it produces emotions while playing. Completing the game once will take 18-22 hours, depending on how many secondary missions You wanna do.This game isnt really a good game itself but it has to be played when You wanna play the others and the story is nicely told and it gets better with every hour played - a Must-Have for everyone who wannts to play ME2 or 3, which both are fantastic games i think. ME2 is the favorite of most of the ME-Players but i think ME2 and 3 are at a same, fantastic level.			",21,2,0,4,0,0,1

												The beginning to the most beutifully crafted masterpice in video games. And the best part is that Mass effect 1 is actually the ""worst"" of the trilogy for me and still it gets a 10/10. Depending on how you play the game it can last either 12 hours for a rushed expirience or even 30 if you really get into the lore behind it. Watch out with what you choose becouse if you import your game to mass effect 2 it will have a serious impact ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡HOWEVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!IF YOU CAN, PLAY THE TRILOGY ON PS3 if you do not import your character from mass effect 2 to mass effect 3 than the game looses A LOT. A SERIOUS LOSS. It even changes the main storyline and everything. Please if you can play at least both mass effect 2 and 3 on the PS3.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mass Effect is a great game, and the start of a great franchise. I love the story, the choices you make, gameplay, and there is a free mod to update some of the graphics. I recommend this game to everyone! Play it again, before Mass Effect Andromeda comes out!			",391,64,6,50,24,2,56

												I thought it was excellant. The only problem I had was that a couple of areas the characters were just black boxes which made it a little harder to make it to the next section where the characters were normal again. But I still loved it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												We all probably know what Mass Effect is by now. A third person shooter with a bit of decision making.Apart from the fact that this game has a couple of years on it, it still plays well and looks well, better than in a lot of online screenshots or videos dues to different effects.The story start s out slow, kindof boring some might say. But the more I played, the more I got drawn in the world as the story became more complex and the situation more critical.It's also worth to notice that I've heard many times now that your character transfers from Mass Effect into Mass Effect 2. How much of it transfers I do not know but I presume it's the face, which you make at the start.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What can I say!  Hands down the best FPS/RPG ever made.  The whole series was breathtaking.  The stories were deep and immersive.  It was like playing a game and watching a great show.  The combat structure was designed very well.  It is easy to select weapons and choose your abilities without ever leaving the combat screen.  The enemy AI uses cover effectively and uses tactics to manuver and flank when possible.  This is not a rush and kill everything in sight game.  Use your squad commands and utiilze cover or you will be anihilated.  As commander you can take any path you choose in the game.  If you want to be a saint or a sinner its up to you.  Try as I might I cannot find a flaw in the game series.  I've played then for hundreds of hours and I still enjoy them.  About the only thing i can complain about is the secondary mission objective list in the third installment does not work well.  There is no way to tell if you completed the mission or not and sometime no way to know where you need to go back to to complete it.  So take lots of notes.  Other than that this is the best series I have ever played and I cry at night knowing there will be no more.  I guess 3 is the magic number.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is good in many ways. It's a great game, not just for 2007 when it came out, but even now. The mechanics of shooting from cover and teamwork are great, and they really do a lot to help the experience. The story is great, with many characters, drama, and choices. I don't think the choices effect the story, but you can say things however you want. There is also customizable character and class selection. This is one of the best I've played in a while.

												Whenever I think of epic-scale RPGs, my first thoughts turn to the Mass Effect series, and usually after that, its first title that set the stage for one of the most enveloping and immersive gaming experiences that Canada can offer. The structure of the 3 games is akin to that of the original Star Wars trilogy.Though dated and still a bit clunky, the first title in the series of Mass Effect games did a beautiful job of serving as the exposition and rising action for a seemingly limitless amount of story potential. After 3 major games, 4 handheld games, 4 novels, 10 comic books, and a feature-length film[en.wikipedia.org] in the works, BioWare claims that there is still quite a bit of this story that has been left untold. The next title in the Mass Effect series, though enigmatic at the moment, will likely reinvent and redirect the game series as a whole. This game has the player character's customized hero, Commander Shepard, embarking on a galactic quest to catch an elusive rogue agent seemingly working to further his own goals, and to uncover the true hidden meaning behind the possibility of a threat that this galaxy was in no way ready for. The combat system had certain enjoyable aspects that weren't revisited until the third game in the series, such as weapons that don't use thermal clips and the distance and speed covered whilst sprinting. Though I usually have trouble discerning which game of the trilogy is my favorite, most of my thoughts are with its first title, which has imprinted on me as well as many thousands of other players a gaming experience that will never be forgotten.Its visual style and gameplay are something that is only bettered by its successor, Mass Effect 2.

												Really one of the best overall games ever made, especially when it first came out.Not recommended due to the lack of controller support, it's a single player RPG shooting game that started on the Xbox and is made by Microsoft. It's really messed up they re-did all the interfaces to make it practically impossible to play unless you're sitting in a computer chair at a computer desk. Used to play on the xbox for hours on end but they made it impossible. Highly recommend the Xbox version, can't recommend this one at all even on sale.			",106,9,2,24,4,3,5

												You've probably heard of this game/series and the seemingly endless stream of positive feedback it has gotten, and while it certainly is deserving of its praises, those same opinions would probably give the impression that it has minimal to no flaws so I thought I'd list some of them down for you. 1) Too many elevators - you'll spend a needless amount of time watching your squad standing in elevators. Yes, they are literally just standing there doing nothing until the elevator reaches its destination. 2) Horrible vehicle controls - there's a lot of exploration involved which would've been great had the vehicle controls been simple, but instead you'll ragdoll your vehicle all over the place because of how unnatural the controls feel. 3) Poor companion control - if you've ever played Dragon Age, another IP by BioWare, you understand what good control over your squad/party is, but in this game, the only character you can control fluidly and easily is Shepard. 4) Underwhelming final boss fight - I won't go into detail with this one to avoid spoilers, but it was extremely one-dimensional, lacking any sort of variety compared to previous encounters which involve adapting to the situation. Beating a final boss is supposed to feel exhilarating, but this fight left me feeling a bit flat. Now don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed the game and definitely think it is worthy of all its praises. I simply believe it's worth mentioning that it is far from perfect and understandably so since it was developed when its genre was still in its infancy. If you're looking to get it, I do recommend it. Just bear in mind it has annoying quirks you wouldn't ever expect to find in more recent games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A third person shooter with a bit of decision making.Apart from the fact that this game has a couple of years on it, it still plays well and looks well, better than in a lot of online screenshots or videos dues to different effects.The story start s out slow, kindof boring some might say. But the more I played, the more I got drawn in the world as the story became more complex and the situation more critical.It's also worth to notice that I've heard many times now that your character transfers from Mass Effect into Mass Effect 2. How much of it transfers I do not know but I presume it's the face, which you make at the start.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a saga RPG, which means your game continuation carries over into the 2nd and third installments. Meaning you want to buy 1 2 and 3 as a package deal if you are interested in playing.ME1 is a decent game with a decent story, but it does have some issues. If you like game immersion, you will find yourself putting that on hold to complete the seemingly endless side quests. Of course like many other games of the genre, the game ends when you conqure the main quests, leaving no time to do the side quests. So you have to ""pretend"" like you have nothing better to do from an immersion standpoint in order to get them done. All the explorable open world planets that you encounter, need major fleshing out. They are very mountainous and annoying, and the life worlds dont have a single trace of life besides short grass. When you get to a side quest location, you will find its the exact same building over and over again, but maybe with a few different boxes in it. The various atmospheres are interesting and pretty tho. Each planet has a lore section on it thats fun to read about.The codex is pretty in depth and long and will keep you busy for a few hours if you are into that sort of thing. There is rich history and lore established in the game, and you actually feel apart of the established universe.Without spoiling much, the three alien compainions that you get at the start of the game, dont really make much sense as to why they are coming along for the long haul. You are an alliance military commander why do you need these three random aliens again? It is possible to take off with only 2 out of 3, do not do this!!!!  The games continuation in ME2 and ME3 is built around you taking them with you. So its a false choice thats actually sabatorial to you if you choose incorrectly. Now you dont need everyone to survive ME1, and you will figure out what I am talking about, but you do need 3 alien companions when you leave the citadel, and the good news is that you cannot leave without being asked about it first.But your companions are well fleshed out and have interesting stories and backgrounds for the most part..... So thats good.Even tho this is not a Romance game, the Romance is ME1 is a bit of a joke. You can only woo a total of 2 characters, depending on your sex. Not only that, but you only get 1 romance scene before the last mission if you went down that route.___________________________________________________________________________________Yes I would recommend this series. Unfortunatly ME3 is not on steam and we all know Origins is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ POS. Unfortunatly your going to need to mod ME3s ending, get MEHEM or else you will want to riot against EA. Unfortunatly its EA and ME2 and ME3 are DLC grubbing POS. But yes I recommend this game for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mass Effect.I've played enough of this game to know that I want more.More of BioWare's epic writing. More of the deep sci-fi world the game serves up for us on a silver platter, serviette included, in butler uniform (if male). Less of the vehicle sections though; whoever thought that was a good idea might need to revisit the corkboard and check his memos.More of the characters. More of the combat. More consequential choices. More of... nearly everything.Mass Effect may be a third person shooter, but it feels like you're playing an RPG. I've heard that a lot of times; I never really believed it. Now I've gone through the gates: now I see all. And it is awe-inspiring.Yes, animation's a bit clunky, but I stopped noticing it. That didn't stop me from enjoying this epic and neither should it stop you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Whenever I think of epic-scale RPGs, my first thoughts turn to the Mass Effect series, and usually after that, its first title that set the stage for one of the most enveloping and immersive gaming experiences that Canada can offer. The structure of the 3 games is akin to that of the original Star Wars trilogy.Though dated and still a bit clunky, the first title in the series of Mass Effect games did a beautiful job of serving as the exposition and rising action for a seemingly limitless amount of story potential. After 3 major games, 4 handheld games, 4 novels, 10 comic books, and a feature-length film[en.wikipedia.org] in the works, BioWare claims that there is still quite a bit of this story that has been left untold. The next title in the Mass Effect series, though enigmatic at the moment, will likely reinvent and redirect the game series as a whole. This game has the player character's customized hero, Commander Shepard, embarking on a galactic quest to catch an elusive rogue agent seemingly working to further his own goals, and to uncover the true hidden meaning behind the possibility of a threat that this galaxy was in no way ready for. The combat system had certain enjoyable aspects that weren't revisited until the third game in the series, such as weapons that don't use thermal clips and the distance and speed covered whilst sprinting. Though I usually have trouble discerning which game of the trilogy is my favorite, most of my thoughts are with its first title, which has imprinted on me as well as many thousands of other players a gaming experience that will never be forgotten.Its visual style and gameplay are something that is only bettered by its successor, Mass Effect 2.

												The Mass Effect Trillogy are the best games I've ever played. All three games are Singleplayer, 3rd-Person-Sci-Fi-Shooters with a.. restricted open world.ME 1 hasn't nice gameplay or graphics and it seems to be extremely boring at the beginning, but after You became interested in the story it's gettin more amazing with every mission You acomplish. The Story seems rather simple (Commander Shepard hunting a renegard ""Spectre"" who controls a Robot Army) but becomes more twisted. Your character can be designed as You want him/ her to look like, You can choose between 6 different Classes (i.e. Soldier, Infiltrator, Tech, etc.) but the best of all: Choices can be taken in almost every dialogue and whereby the story line can be changed. You can build relationships to crewmembers and decide to play as paragon or renegard. Although the synchronisation, the graphics and gameplay dont reach the average but it produces emotions while playing. Completing the game once will take 18-22 hours, depending on how many secondary missions You wanna do.This game isnt really a good game itself but it has to be played when You wanna play the others and the story is nicely told and it gets better with every hour played - a Must-Have for everyone who wannts to play ME2 or 3, which both are fantastic games i think. ME2 is the favorite of most of the ME-Players but i think ME2 and 3 are at a same, fantastic level.			",21,2,0,4,0,0,1

												Mass Effect (1 to 3) is one of the absolute best story-driven game series ever.  The whole series is an absolute gem which will make you contemplate some of the deepest philosophical questions and engage you perhaps even more than good literature would.  The depth of the story paralleled only by The Witcher series (or arguably surpassed, especially after reading the short stories and novels which inspired The Witcher game series).  I cannot recommend the Mass Effect series highly enough.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Yeah, I did the narrative reversed, but you know everything is true. Now get your life together and play ME1 so you can play ME2 again (and skip ME3).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is very important to the Mass Effect storyline and if you want to have your decisions (that you made personally) carry over this is a mandatory playthrough. However, I first played Mass Effect 2 and then Mass Effect 3, and this game isn't nearly as good as it's sequels. The people that say it is are simply judging the game off nostalgia. The graphics (even with multiple graphics mods installed) are almost unbearably bad at times. The control scheme and interface is also a mess. And there's this weird head bobbing that's intergrated into the UI that gives a lot of players motion sickness including myself. But if you buy this game you aren't buying it for any of those things I just criticized. You're buying it because you want to understand the entire story of Commander Shepard and understand more of the Mass Effect universe.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very fun third-person shooter. It has simple yet exciting gameplay, paired together with RPG style skills, customization and dialog. Many choices you make have consequences, and you're forced to make many tough ones throughout the story. Great story, great gameplay, great characters. Its great.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
