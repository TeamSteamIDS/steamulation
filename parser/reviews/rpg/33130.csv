												Guns, Countless Bullets and an almost endless wave of Zombies. There is something strangely satisfying about playing this game with your favourite playlist playing in the background. That feeling of leaning back in your comfy chair and unleashing a wave of molten metal justice into the unsuspecting horde of zombies. I'm not usually one for such mindless carnage (although now I think about it I enjoyed the hell out of Carmageddon all those years ago). Yet, I found myself turning to this game when I had no idea what else to play. I'm not going to sugar coat the game at all, it 'says what it is on the tin' to be fair to the developers - It's  Zombie Shooter. That's all there is to it, yet there feels like there's more. It has a Campaign and a Survival Mode, both of which are pretty fun, although I did find myself enjoying the Survival Mode more. In Survival Mode you have survive as many Zombie Waves as you can in a small confined area. There are a selection of maps (each with their own unique element), a wide range of guns and a collection of power ups to use as you see fit. Interestingly there's a perk system too, which allows you to customise your character as you level up from killing the Zombies and surviving the waves. Campaign mode was OK for what it is, a isometric 'corridor' shooter, and doesn't really try to be anything else. However, it does suffer from some environmental clipping, which is perhaps the most danger you'll find yourself in as it's easy to become trapped/stuck (forcing you to restart the level). Much like the Survival mode you can upgrade your character, but you have to find the guns to unlock them (rather than the guns falling off of Zombies and into your lap). I think what I really liked about the Campaign was that there wasn't a half-arsed story tacked onto it to try and justify the mindless onslaught against the Zombie Hoard. It just plonked you into the game and allowed you to go. It makes me realise that I'd actually like to see a Zombie Movie based on that idea - no poorly written story with terrible actors, just a person or two killing endless zombies before the zombies kill them. The controls are basic and use as WSAD approach with Mouse aiming, sadly no gamepad support (that I could find). There are no real options to customise resolution or graphics, so you'll have to make do with what they offer. The sound is OK, but not amazing. I do feel as though this game is missing out on a killer soundtrack to support the carnage. 


Controls... like you need anything more than shoot!

If you have low expectations, and are perhaps just looking for something to sit back and waste a few hours on this game is ideal - it might even surprise you.			",784,264,22,154,145,15,151

												This game doesn't really need review. It's all about shooting things. Then you buy better weapons to shoot things more efficiently. And then you encounter even more things you can shoot. More you could imagine. Buy it if you like to shoot things.Don't buy it if you care about graphics, story, bugs, good soundtrack and interesting boss fights.Yeah - finall boss is probably the most boring finall boss I have ever seen.

												Zombie Shooter is a really good little indie title that is another one of these games where you can only really play for fifteen minutes at a time, there is almozt zero difficulty in shooting hoards and hoards of zombies, the only thing that will stop you is ammo, and even that is pretty much unlimited.The campaign offers little difficulty in terms of level design, you are basically running around looking for the exit into the next room by looking for some barrels or button to press to open a door. All in all, this is a pretty good game, definately one that you will probably be able to pick up very cheaply or in a bundle at some point.			",1544,456,43,234,159,12,209

												Sometimes, you want to play a complex game with a rich storyline and well-written dialogues. But sometimes, you just want some brutal, old-fashioned violence. And this is when you want to play games like Zombie Shooter. It's not a ground-breaking game with advanced gameplay feature, no Sir. This is a game where you shoot zombies. Everything is in the title, and this is everything you'll do all along the game.Is this repetitive? Maybe, but this is an arcade game. You will play it when you want to vent your violence on a good old game, or when you want to beat your friend's highscore. Is it worth the 15€ price for the entire pack ? Maybe, but it'd be better to get it cheaper if you're not sure you'll like it.TL;DR - this is a cool little arcade game you'll play between two other games. Not the best one ever, but is well enough sufficient as a pastime.			",875,246,32,90,58,8,101

												This was one of the first games I got gifted on Steam, and it was part of the Shooter Bundle by Sigma Team. What you do in the game is all in the title. I find this game to be very relaxing, as you kill zombies to an awesome rock/techno soundtrack. You can level up, improve your stats, and buy various items to help you on each level. There isn't much of a story, but thats not what you buy this kind of game for. Zombie Shooter is a fun little shooter and if you go in expecting that, you really will enjoy it.

												This is a mindless awesome shoot-a-thon with tons of weapons, upgrades, character leveling, power-ups and alot more.  Three game modes (campaign, survival & timed arenas) provide a small diversion from the obvious repetitive nature of gameplay.  Though dont expect anything but graphics that were acceptable in the 80s.  There are no achievements & no multiplayer to keep you playing this.  However the game does have a certain base charm.  If mowing down hordes with a shed load of weapons while never really getting challenged then this is a decent cheap game.  Just dont expect anything too much.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A simple top down isometric shooter. A few weapons to choose from, levels are nothing interesting and mosters are quite generic overall. Gameplay is good and runs smooth, a few powerups to use along with a very simple level up system. An ok game overall. Music is alright. While the game is nothing special, it was worth playing through once, my only real problem with it is that there are way too many ammo drops and the game is quite easy, though this goes for almost every game out there.

												I am missing a neutral possible Review chance. I have seen games that were much worse than this little action-shooter. But I have also seen games that were much better... But; yes, you read right - I said but, this game is quite old. It runs smoothly and perfectly and is a good small waste of time. Of course it is not Left4Dead, not Resident Evil, but it's one of the earlier ""Zombie-Apocalypse"" games here on Steam. The Mechanics are simple and easy to learn. It is fast paced and easy to play, at times to easy - because you are fighting zombies with a nearly unlimited amount of bullets (at least for your pistol) - and that is what makes the game unrealistic. But still fun. The worst of the game is that there are some glitches that can catch your character and force a restart. But this was also in so many high priced games recently, that these little bugs are not so important. It has the right atmosphere. Though the music could have been more sinister imho. In a bundle a classic, but buying the four games for 14,99? No way, and I won't praise the game for this pricing because of three things:1) To old2) To many glitches3) Replayability is zero.So, Yes if it's in a bundle. But No if you think of buying it full priced.			",1554,811,52,244,215,11,265

												Got a spare copy of this game from a friend, let it lay there for a while, not even looking at vids/screens of it. Got to playing it today out of 120% boredom, and it killed my boredom for 2 whole hours, since the game is rather short. But it was entertaining, and for anyone looking for no story, quick action, hundreds of zombies and awesome guns (and upgrades!), get this game. The playthrough on normal difficulty is repetitive yes, but sometimes that's all you need. The game drags you through neatly designed levels with loads of zombies of different nature and different abilities, and the graphics, although clearly inspired by older games, are very meticulous and nice. For killing my boredom 10/10, and overall I'd say 7/10 since it's short.			",152,11,3,15,19,1,28

												The mindless action offered by the SIGMA team continues! This time it's zombies instead of aliens. There's not much to say, really. It's all about the action: you kill hordes of zombies while exploring the levels, all from a isometric perspective. Some people find its repetitiveness dull, however, I liked it along with its fast-paced gameplay style.From all the SIGMA games out there this or Alien Shooter 2 should be picked.

												Shutdown your brain and hold down your left mouse button, it’s time for some mindless slaughtering in Zombie Shooter. The in-game screenshots presented in the storefront doesn’t do this game justice. You can’t possibly feel the satisfaction of blowing up hordes of the undead in to gigantic piles of blood and gore just by looking at screenshots; you’d have to participate in the slaughtering. I played many top down shooters before, but none are this satisfying. All the things you could possible want from a top down shooter is present in the game; you can pump up your stats by leveling and there are shops at the end of each level to buy new guns. The only downfall is that it’s terribly short; most should be able to beat this game with relative ease in around 2 hours. Not a must buy, but if it’s on sale for a dollar, you would be doing a disservice to yourself by not buying and playing it.			",2378,1002,91,291,305,24,411

												Somehow they made killing tons and tons of zombies utterly boring. Might recommend you play a level or two if, like me, you find this in the bottom of your steam library, and then see if it's for you.You get guns. There is a 'story' and you kill things that look like zombies.You go to X, then Y, then kill more zombies. The end.I quit out of utter boredom. You hold the mouse button and hover over enemies and decimate everything with your infinite pistols. Repeat.It's just so utterly dull to move around, holding the mouse, killing everything. Then for some reason, they get guns (???). They are able to hit you but the aiming is weird and it's hard to actually hit them back.Also the explosive weapons are♥♥♥♥♥♥poor compared to the starting pistols.The AI's kinda dumb, the isometric means you can't see enemies behind walls. That being said, it's not broken. If you want a working game, it's a working game. It's just so plain dull and uninteresting.Just...so dull.			",686,324,19,127,93,8,147

												As I was starting the game I was wondering, if there could be done anything to make ""... Shooter"" games from Sigma Team even better than they are. When I saw character select screen I was confused - ""it looks same like in Alien Shooter... maybe they just replaced aliens with zombies?"". How mistaken I was. So what could be done to make this simply yet amazing game better? Upgrade and level up system! I didn't liked how Alien Shooter forces me to use next weapons because if I won't, then I will not make any progress and won't complete game. In Zombie Shooter you can upgrade your favorite weapons and use them for much longer time - now you don't need to buy this uber plasma minigun to beat the game. And what's the deal with leveling your character? It makes you spent points to skills which make your character fit your style. Also, if you are looking in every corner it has become more rewarding than ever: not only because of money, but also for hidden exp capsules. You can also see that each level is designed much better than in Alien Shooter. And of course, zombies are also more fun to kill than alien*. The only thing that stays same is fun in killing those creatures - which means great fun.I'm glad that I buyed and tried Zombie Shooter. Maybe it's because I'm fan of Alien Shooter but I had fun, and probably I will have more when next time I will have whim to play something not demanding, brainless and with tons of blood. I wanted to kill zombies and Zombie Shooter delivered it. Good job Sigma Team.*biased opinion			",1737,715,60,244,224,20,321

												So, I'd have racked up some more hours on this thing, maybe even completed it, but the game grew sentient and realised my save files were the only thing stopping it from flying free into the wilds of my uninstalled list.Alas, it wasn't actually too bad. Curiously, far and away the best piece of game design evident was the 'feedback' you got from killing zombies - a pleasant combination of audible and visual 'splatting' that made for rather satisfying gunplay. The variety of weapons and various other utilities was just wide enough to inject the game with that ever-pleasant feeling of progression we all know and love from Call of Duty, so it was a pretty fun distraction to play here, there and everywhere when I had 20 minutes to brutally murder.A stellar example of a 7/10 game.

												It's the one of the best bullet-hell FPS i've ever played!There is only 1 disadventage - it's short.Really short...I had to complete it 3 times in a raw to get enough.I was really disappointed when launched 2nd part - it $ucks.But the 1st part is amazing.Buy it right now don't even think.And btw, Devs, if you read this: if you ever will make 3rd part that will be the same with 1st but a way longer - i will buy it instantly.For any money.

												Excellent arcade shooter with a small progression system.  The game's not extremely long in the campaign mode, but there are a few endless modes to keep you company.Honestly, the Alien Shooter/Zombie Shooter games are short but sweet, with no filler whatsoever, and no time to take a breath.  You'll be dealing with huge numbers of enemies, firing huge numbers of bullets, and mopping up like you're the immortal spawn of some kind of anti-undead deity.Great games, really.  Just great games.			",850,155,26,144,50,4,79

												A basic over head shooter with a little throw back to graphics of the late 90's(Fallout, Starcraft, Warcraft, Diablo). Like:-Music, it's defitany one of the biggest pluses to this game.  Main menu music is a nice throw back to Resident Evil games. Otherwise the rest is this rock style kinda like Starcraft rock.-Classic late 90's graphics.-Nice mix of open and close spaces.-Distructable enviroment is a nice touchDislikes:-The music doesnt really fade out well.  There's a snap in the sound clips or a sharp ending.  It's not a big complant it's just noticable.-Ememies can be too easy at times where you can just pistol your way through most situations.  Pistols are a little to OP well upgraded to full. -Not worth $15 wait for a sale. All in all its a good time waster.  Nothing too serious but good relaxing fun.			",178,23,6,16,9,0,15

Sure graphics look totally outdated in its isometric top down 2D view, but then again this gives it that special charm, especially with its insane ammounts of decals and blood. And best of all it will probably work ultra fast even on crappiest netbooks and nettops.Some will complain over this and that, but i think it's great. And old school top down pixelated gory carnage.

												Is it possible to have too many zombies? I think this game may be pushing the limit! This is an insanely fun and addicting shooter. Your screen will literally turn red from all the zombies you kill. Decent selection of devastating weapons with levelling up features on both your weapons and your character. The graphics are the biggest weakness and the camera angle sucks in certain spots, but the non-stop action keeps you too busy to notice. If this game was co-op, it would be off the hook. Alien Swarm should take some pointers from this game about how to put fun into killing zombies.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												A simple top down zombie shooter which I had loads of fun with. I love how powerful the weapons feel in this game and how many freaking zombies there can be at once. It's short (less than 3 hours) but it was cheap and came in a pack; plus it has some survival modes to do.In the sequel they did improve the graphics and the amount of content but I prefer the feel of the weapons in this one. You feel so much more powerful but not overpowered because there are loads of zombies. I haven't played that much through the sequel but the weapons you get later on might be better and the campaign is defiantly longer.Short but fun.			",1044,309,42,127,64,12,143

Keep the left mouse button pressed and you're good to go.I'm amazed that I've endured playing through this game...Don't bother.

												A bland, simplistic and repetitive action game in which you, as the player, shoot your way trhough an horde of zombies just because.It has smallish RPG elements (As you get points to increase stats that affects in the amount of ammo you can carry, how good you aim, etc), you can upgrade your weapons... and nothing more. Its just bang bang bang until you get to the slightly interesting final boss battle and the end. Not to mention the horrible collision detection and the awfuls (even for a Zombie Game) A.I.Unless you are looking for some brain-dead (pun intended) fun, Zombie Shooter will be a waste of time and (looking at its current price tag) of money. If you are looking for some shooting, maybe this could be your game. Maybe not.Got to say that I played the sequel some time ago and kinda of enjoyed it, even though it was the same, just a bit better.			",327,90,5,30,22,3,49

												Zombie Shooter is a game that manages to be casual, not because of it's gameplay but because of it's length, a measly 1 hour campaign and two survival modes is all you get and all that you can do to try and extend it is to go for leaderboard scores. Offline leaderboards that is.The base gameplay of Zombie Shooter is not terrible in any way, it is just simple. It takes the top down shooter and removes everything about the shooting.While this wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing in other games Zombie Shooter doesn't add anything to fill the void. Not even content.What you are left with is a short, shallow game, fighting the same aliens over and over just in different colors.What little enjoyment I have gotten out of Zombie Shooter comes from the fact that it's a bundle game. If it had been a game I had purchased I would have been disappointed with every minute of it.			",980,332,42,138,118,11,215

It definitely has '90s graphics and sound, but there's no good stuff. Like fun. It doesn't have much fun in it. Crusader had fun in it.In conclusion, this is a bad game. It's bundle fluff. Steam shows that we have 6 hours of play on record, but that's because someone here started to play it and then just walked away with it still running.P.S.

												Do not buy this game. For some people, the game will shut off when you die. Even if you buy med-kits or extra lives, they will not automatically deploy and as soon as your health hits zero, the games shuts off and you have to restart from Steam. This started happening to me after I got to level four, which took me more than two hours, so now Steam won't even give me a refund. I tried to explain that the glitch started happening after two hours into it, and now on levels 1, 2, and 3 when I die the game shuts off, but they did not care. This was a huge waste of money.

												One of the things I miss about video games is the fact that you used to be able to throw a cartridge into something, boot it up, and play it for about 10 minutes and make some actual progress or have a little bit of fun on the way. Truly, a few video games of the past really fit this bill perfectly as little time wasters. This is one of those games, though after having a couple of hours of play invested in it, I do feel the need to point out some problems that I haven't seen other reviews point out. The idea of shooting zombies is one that has been done one million times, now this isn't necessarily a drawback, but it seems a lot more like some of the characters in this game are mutants rather than zombies. Zombies are a pretty straightforward concept, and though I do like some variation in the type of zombies, there's usually an archetype that people tend to expect when shooting at them. In other words, zombies coming at you with rocket launchers and guns doesn't make much sense. However, this is balanced by the fact that there are zombie dogs and zombie rats, which I always find entertaining. Another thing that I will give this game credit for is that it definitely fits its name, it is Zombie Shooter, and you will not play another Zombie Shooter that is quite as Zombie or quite as Shootie as this one. Well, you probably will, you probably have! As others have said, there's no really new ground covered here, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. If you're looking for a game that you can roll out of bed and play for a few minutes then turn off without feeling guilty about the amount of progress you've made because you just needed something to play while you wake up and drink your coffee, this may help you metabolize that caffeine a little easier. Now I will move on to some improvements that I feel would make this game better and more enjoyable. First of all, fix it so you can move around certain dead zombies - you will get stuck at times and have to completely exit to the Main menu and restart the level because you get stuck behind them and cannot escape. This also happens with extras boxes, certain walls, you name it. Sometimes, you just get stuck, and you can't get out of that position. This is irritating, even if you're simply playing for ten minutes. If you get super involved with it and decide to play for more than a half hour (or as long as you can take hearing ""BLARGH ARGH THUMPTHUMP WHOMP BLLAAAHHHGHHGHHRHRHARRGHHURGLE"" and get stuck behind something, you will have a screaming fit with your monitor. At least you will if you're as impatient as I am. In other words: Patch this. Just make it so you can walk over all dead zombie types, you can walk over most of them as they vaporize into a puddle of red goop, why not all of them? Yes, your character designs for the ones that mutate or shoot several tongues at you are awesome, but when they're dead you don't need to make them immovable objects. Second, fix the night vision. The night vision sucks. It's easier to see without it in 99% of cases. Maybe have different types of drones. I realize that the drone is a little bit of a wuss move for anyone to make playing this game, but having the option definitely helps, but the one drone option that is available is surprisingly useful..for about 30 seconds, before it gets blown up by a zombie lobbing rockets at you (again, this doesn't make sense in a zombie game, but I'm not looking for realism in something like this.) Fourth, maybe throw some steam achievements or trading cards in there. I don't know how much effort this takes on the part of the publisher or whoever programs the game, and I know many would argue that it ruins the fun of playing because it takes the focus away from the gameplay and more toward the achievements, but come on, achievements are cool! It's not that they replace real life achievements such as learning to play the guitar or landing a promotion at your job, it's that they're neat little decorations for your profile, or bragging rights whenever one of your friends insists they've gotten further in a game than you have. ""Oh yeah?!"" you will say, and show them the achievement that proves otherwise, that you splattered more idiot rocket-launcher wielding zombies than they did, that you survived an onslaught of 8,000 mindless ""GUUUHHHRRGHHHS"" coming at your face while trying to turn the lights on in another underground vault for the 900th time. I'm going to wrap this up by saying that this game is worth the money depending on what you want to get out of it. I don't think anyone reading this review or buying the game is expecting a AAA title or to invest a hundred hours of their time into it, but it is worth the money to play it and I would recommend it, just be prepared for some somewhat irritating moments when you get stuck behind something that has the health that you desperately need and you have to completely restart the level because of this. Also be prepared to become quickly annoyed with having zombies shoot rockets at you without actually attempting to eat your brain. Finally, one thing I didn't mention in this review that bears mentioning is that the RPG elements are extremely fun. They do have real impact to your gameplay, and playing with them does make you consider whether or not you're making the best use of the game money you spent to get through each level. So whether you're looking to waste some time or....waste some time, pick this up. When I weigh the problems of this game with the positives of it, I have to give it a 6.5 out of 10. With a patch, it could easily be taken up to 7.5. Good job, guys.			",2909,1137,96,354,354,29,474

												Zombie Shooter looks and is extremely low budget. It could easily have been a DOS game from the mid 90s, but it was actually released in 2007. With that said, it is an enjoyable DOS game from the mid 90s. The level design is basic, linear, and straightforward. Animations are the bare minimum that one could expect from an average game from that era. Each mission involves doing very similar actions, like reaching certain specific areas of the map a couple times in order to proceed. There are several items and upgrades that could be purchased between each level, as well as upgrading skills from your character, which makes for an interesting and fun addition to the upfront running and shooting. The AI has very serious problems, and at times you may use this to your advantage. Zombies will often get stuck behind walls or other objects, and many times they will also spin in place and not move, without doing anything else. Besides the campaign, there are two additional game modes, but they are much less interesting and do not provide for a true extension of replay ability. Zombie Shooter is a short and basic game, with very simple game play mechanics. It is plagued by severe AI path finding issues as well as general AI problems. There are also various bugs throughout the game, and the final boss is not challenging at all, in comparison to the massive groups of non-boss zombies that will come at you almost non-stop. Also, the small amount of text found in Zombie Shooter has some grammar errors. There is very little variety to be found in Zombie Shooter, and the short lived amount of game play will not keep you very interested, and it will not last long. For an unintentional DOS game from the mid 90s, this is a small gaming distraction amidst the abundance of better, more polished games out there.Zombie Shooter is mediocre.

												i'm not that big on top-down shooters but when they don't support widescreen or let me change the controls then what reason do i have to play them? it felt pointless and monotonous by the fourth level or so, and the view-obstructing walls and eventually getting stuck next to a bunk made me quit this game instead of trying to finish it.

												Zombie Shooter looks and is extremely low budget. It could easily have been a DOS game from the mid 90s, but it was actually released in 2007. With that said, it is an enjoyable DOS game from the mid 90s. The level design is basic, linear, and straightforward. Animations are the bare minimum that one could expect from an average game from that era. Each mission involves doing very similar actions, like reaching certain specific areas of the map a couple times in order to proceed. There are several items and upgrades that could be purchased between each level, as well as upgrading skills from your character, which makes for an interesting and fun addition to the upfront running and shooting. The AI has very serious problems, and at times you may use this to your advantage. Zombies will often get stuck behind walls or other objects, and many times they will also spin in place and not move, without doing anything else. Besides the campaign, there are two additional game modes, but they are much less interesting and do not provide for a true extension of replay ability. Zombie Shooter is a short and basic game, with very simple game play mechanics. It is plagued by severe AI path finding issues as well as general AI problems. There are also various bugs throughout the game, and the final boss is not challenging at all, in comparison to the massive groups of non-boss zombies that will come at you almost non-stop. Also, the small amount of text found in Zombie Shooter has some grammar errors. There is very little variety to be found in Zombie Shooter, and the short lived amount of game play will not keep you very interested, and it will not last long. For an unintentional DOS game from the mid 90s, this is a small gaming distraction amidst the abundance of better, more polished games out there.Zombie Shooter is mediocre.

												This game is pretty cookie cutter, all in all.  Takes about 3 hours to beat on normal difficulty.  Buy it on sale, if at all.Here's what you get (based on my playthough) -- 9 levels, only a few types of enemies, repetitive but passable music, no story.  Shoot lots of zombies, pick up health, move on.  Spend money to buy new guns and upgrade existing ones with better stats.  Gear progression is pretty lackluster, your new guns completely obsolete the old ones because ammo is plentiful.Some 'RPG' elements in that you upgrade stats after each level based on killing enough zombies, but its just Health / Ammo Capacity / Speed / Accuracy (yes, shots stray).This is really the kind of game you'd have played back in the day when PC gaming was new, for for a $1.25 throwback its not bad, just nothing amazing.  The devs seem to have a made a lot of games like this one which are basically (as I said) cookie cutter of each other, just with a little different dough each time.			",278,109,4,59,8,3,22

												A top-down view single-player shooting game with some RPG elements like leveling up and customizing equipment, developed by Russian developer ""Sigma Team"", player fights against a horde of zombies (as its title says) . 3 game modes available, campaign mode consisting of 10 levels, which will take less than 3 hours to complete, and 2 score attack modes both of which are quite boring as player has to keep playing until his character dies. Once you finish the campaign mode, just uninstall the game and move on to your next one. This low-price title has some fun, but don't expect much replayability. I wouldn't have bought this game unless I had got it via ""Alien vs Zombie"" bundle for US $0.99. lolTip for campaign mode: try to save your money for ""Magma Minigun"" the strongest weapon in the game, and avoid upgrading others, which are waste of your money.(Japanese translation below)==================================================ロシアのSigmaTeamにより開発された、タイトルが示す通りゾンビの大群相手に戦う見下ろし視点の1人用シューティングゲーム、レベルアップやアイテム購入といったRPG要素があります。3時間足らずで終わる全10面のキャンペーンと、1ミスするまでゲームが延々と続く退屈なスコアアタックが2種類あります。キャンペーンモードが終わったらアンインストールして次のゲームをしましょう。値段が安い作品ながらそれなりに楽しめますが、何度もプレイするようなやりこみ要素を期待してはいけません。101円のエイリアン対ゾンビバンドルが無ければ、まず買うことは無かっただろうゲームです。キャンペーンモードで役立つ情報：キャンペーンモードでは最強の武器マグマ・ミニガンを買うためにひたすら資金を貯めましょう、他の武器のアップグレードは資金の無駄です。			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So this is another one of their somewhat top-down kill-the-creepy-monsters game. But I'm going to take this game as a single game. What can I say about it is that it's rather... Basic. You mow down zombies, get money and XP, upgrade, mow down more zombies. No replay value I'm afraid. Although what I can say is that it's perfect for killing a few hours.Well, few notes though... It's a game with zombies and guns and zombies with guns. And weapons have endless magazines that can fit unlimited bullets. Ain't that fun?Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

												There is no doubt in my mind--Zombie Shooter is the absolute pinnacle of modern PC gaming.  Drawing deep from the well of both classic English literature and Germany philosophy  (Heideggerian-Existential theories and Kierkegaardian paranoia colliding with Titus Andronicus-esque drama and bloodshed, anyone?) But calling it a PC Game is doing this game a disservice--Zombie Shooter is far more than a game.  It is an experience comparable and competitive with the greatest of cinematic (Citizen Kane, step out of the way) and sonic (Tchakivosky and Wagner look simply elementary compared to the rhythm of this game) experiences.  We could dwell on art direction or sound design, but that would only prove to be eclipsing the most important trait of Zombie Shooter:  story.  Never before have I felt so interwoven with a protagonist.  In fact, I am at this moment uncertain if I am actually writing this review, or if my life is contained within this game.  100 / 100.

												Blast rats. Blast zombies. Blast everything that moves. Profit.Considering that you can get him for a really low price if you wait for the right bundle or steam sale it's a good option for old fashioned shoot'em up aficionados. For your money you'll get a well-rounded game that will satiate your thirst for blood and mayhem.  Isometric view -Fallout style, which it gives the game a familiar feel for me- a character level system based on four stats, good amount of weapon choices and lots of rats and zombies to try them on. The musical aspect it's not very remarkable but the fast-paced action makes up for it, after all, we're here to fire shots and explode zombies, not to cultivate our souls.A as expected the mechanic it's pretty straightforward: kill and don't get killed, pick up money and upgrades, level up, buy more upgrades, repeat. Can be monotone of course, but generally when you start up these kind of games that's exactly what you're looking for: mind-numbing, intense action with lots of instant gratification elements.

												8/10Zombie Shooter feels a lot like an improved version of Alien Shooter. They're very similar games, with the same premise: run and shoot all zombies in sight. Same graphics, same controls, everything, with the main difference being that the enemies are zombies instead of aliens - which is perfectly good so far since that worked really well with Alien Shooter. And while Alien Shooter was already quite fun, Zombie Shooter brings some important improvements.The first is that there are more upgrades to buy and there's a leveling system that makes a huge difference.The second is that the game's difficulty is WAY more balanced - it's a lot more playable and a lot less frustrating, while still maintaining at least some challenge.The third is that there's a lot more variety of scenarios, instead of always that same ""inside a bunker"" look that Alien Shooter had through all levels.Yet, I still need to mention the camera angles since it's one problem that all games from Alien Shooter and Zombie Shooter seems to have and was never fixed... It's really bothersome because there are enemies and items that will often show up behind walls, making the player unable to see them. This could easily be fixed with a non-fixed camera angle or transparency effect.Highly recommended for anyone who just wants a game to run'n'gun.			",1997,642,63,205,142,17,217

												Simple but fun thirdperson action shooter with massive amount of gore. Story nonexistent and really short playtime.Rating: 5/10 - definitely worth a buy on sale.			",387,155,5,77,48,8,81

												This game is absolutely worth owning.  Cheap, but ridiculously fun.  Endless zombie hordes coupled with ever ramping ridiculous weaponry and enough gore to make George A. Romero blush.  The game is ludicrous, get involved.			",164,29,0,9,8,1,13

												Good mindless fun.If you're looking for a game that will make you think, plan, and strategize...look elsewhere.  If you're in the mood to blast wave after wave of zombies and related creatures...this is your game.			",372,58,21,38,26,3,35

												It's a fun little top down shooter, it's fairly old now, but it holds up, it's short takeing about 2 hours tops to beat, the best i can describe this game is 'it was good for it's time' but as of now if you want a quick play don't expect much but alot of shooting and alot of gore, but overall it's a good game.

												A fun mindless shooter, no thought required, just blast away. There's even a free Demo (time limited) so you can check it out. Has a few minor issues, but nothing game breaking.			",144,31,0,29,2,0,2
