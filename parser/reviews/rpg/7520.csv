												My 30 minutes of gameplay is just trying to activate a game that won't activate. Each time it fails to activate, you have to manually re-enter the keycode and then it wants you to register it with lots of personal info (name, address, birth date, phone #, etc).And if it fails, then it's a problem on my end, so natually it wants my proxy password,  and yet I don't have any problems with any other games....Cold day in hell when I give that up just so I can activate a game that shouldn't require all this BS to get going. First thing you learn, NEVER GIVE OUT ANY PASSWORDS TO ANYONE!!!!! What the hell is this developer thinking?? ",250,82,20,59,93,2,136

												Am I the only one disgusted by how game/software companies think they have the right to the customer's personal information? I bought Two Worlds II, installed it, and got ready to play it but that's not going to happen. Why? Because before I can play it they want to know my name, email, where I live, my birthday, my mother's shoe size etc. (Well not my mother's shoe size but you get what I'm saying). If it was a game I was paying to play online, sure I can understand they need a way to get their money. But not for something I've already payed for. I know they're not the only ones pulling this they just happen to be the last straw. Now I'm stuck with a game I won't be palying.			",31,8,0,12,0,0,4

												I'll be completely up front, I have not played one minute of this game (my time in game represents background idling for cards while I did other things). So if it's an in depth discussion of how Two Worlds II plays is what you are after, move on and read another review.What this game does have, and why I won't be playing it is DRM that takes intrusiveness to new heights. In order to complete the registration process, it wants me to supply my street address, date of birth, and gender? I see no reason to supply this information to a game developer in order to play a game. I have no interest in entrusting my time to a game by a developer that has such little respect for my privacy. I decided to opt out by uninstalling the game and never playing it. I leave this review for others who may want to opt out by never getting it in the first place.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I however cant condone this kind of treatment of legitimate customers. a solid  7/10 game becomes an easy 0/10 just because of intrusive drm.Edit 2: wow, a few of you seem to like being taken for mugs. but thats ok, its your choice and your personal information.

												While I would sincerely love to give this game a try, in no way should I provide my address, date of birth, or any of the ridiculous amount of information required to get through the DRM to ""register"" the game.There is no call for this level of intrusiveness. With just an email address, people can cause all sorts of havok. With all that information they want, they could steal my entire identity!

												this game is actually way too good for the rpg genre. it has great magic, fighthing and character development systems. it has horse riding and sailing, platform jumping, sneaking, thieving, assassinations, huge dungeons, caves, many monsters and items for loot etc etc...but unfortunately it is an incomplete game. most prolly it's developer ran out of money in the project and had to release it prematurely. more than half of the maps are deserted! no loot, no monsters, no missions, nothing. you run around hoping to see some things but mostly it's just empty terrain...for example <spoiler> third chapter takes place in the middle of an island inbetween some high rock walls and believe it or not, you can't get out of the rock walls and roam the rest of the island </spoiler>. very silly indeednevertheless it is a very good and stable game with more than 50hrs of game play for average rpg fan...would i recommend it? no, not in it's premature state...but do get it if you find it under some steam sales. it's definitly worth it...

												What should have been a good game is ruined by a defective copy protection system, (why did they even bother putting it on steam then?)  occaisionally it bugs out and demands you re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-enter your serial number.. on top of that, when it demands the  serial number, it also re-demands that you register.. which if you already registered .. will fail. On the other hand if you manage to login past the stupid protection, the game is ok to play with passable graphics. Just dont log out until you beat it or get sick of it, or you may have to re-enter your serial YET AGAIN and if you get your registration info wrong the second time dont expect to be playing it very much...Ironically I read an article indicating there was a no-cd hack made for this that removed the serial check, and fixed some other game breaking bugs too.  The orignal makers of the game couldn't do this for the steam version... why exactly?   Who knows. But they lost my respect as a result.			",156,28,1,23,12,0,31

												Normally my opinion is very standard and mainstream so 99% of the time I agree when a game has many negative reviews. This time I cannot agree because the first hours I started this game I had so much fun. It reminds me of Ultima and Morrowind. The world is really open and huge and even if you follow the main story you have plenty of possibilties to explore on your own. Direct from the beginning you can have a huge profit if you start reading the books and looting the chests you find and the artwork is really stunning even for todays standards. The opening cinematic is really nice and made you feel really part of the world.The crafting system is fun because useless items give you resources and this resources you can use to upgrade your valueable items.Like in Morrowind you can develop your character while you play and you are not restricted to only one class.If you read the turorial messages it give you all information about key bindings and while it's sometimes annoying at the beginning to make your character do what you want him/her to do, but like in real life after some practice you become comfortable with it.There is a lot of character interaction, but it never gets annoying because you don't  have to read pages of gossip. If you want more information about subjects you can read the books or buy the strategy guides on Steam.I bought the game long time ago before it was on sales on Steam and don't regret. I bought the strategy guides now just to tell the devs I really like this game.Most important of all is that I really think the devs have passion for their project and that's what you can see in every single part of the game. I don't understand people rating this so negative without explaining what is so wrong about the game just because they were asked for their profile when starting the game. Get over it.If you like exploring every part of the world in your own story with your own character doing what you like to do and want a huge adventure with fighting monsters and explore secrets don't think twice to get this chem now when it's on sale.

												I'm happy to say that this game is a HUGE improvement over the first Two Worlds game. First, let me say the bad news:The combat is still kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥, but not so horrible that you can't enjoy the game. Sometimes, the combat is an absolute joy because it is a tad wonkly and I had many laughs because of it.Horses still suck AND there's no horse combat. Not even one step forward, huh? 2 steps back and that's it. Meh.Visuals are fine, but some character models are just gross.Voice overs still suck, but who cares. UI kinda sucks, but it's usable. Hell, I think MechWarrior's UI 2.0 is just fine, so take my opinion for what it's worth.Still a ton of bugs, just like Two Worlds I.Now the good. HUGE improvements on everything, even on the things that still kinda suck. Within the context of this series, that's a good thing. At least they learned.OH MY GOD the magic! The combos for magic, warrior abilities, and archer/thief stuff is great. SO MANY POSSIBILITIES. I dig that, I really do.Big map, lots of baddies to kill. I like. The teleportation system is 10x better and more reminiscent of something out of TES. That's a good design, keep it, it works.And the quest system is great and the story is...eh, not so horrible. It's not great, but it'll do.Character customization is waaaay better, and that's good. However you still can't make a female in single player mode, DAFUQ, TopWare? All in all, I give it a 6.5/10 would probably bang again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Two Worlds II is your typical fantasy adventure/RPG game with loads of enemies, challenges, things to do, average story-telling & plot, mediocre graphics and a very grindy multiplayer. However.. Even though this game has got some flaws it does deliver on some areas which makes it all worth the while.As far as the single-player story goes it's nothing special, really. It's very generic and the character you play as is very easy to forget about (lacking background-story, no real connection). None of the main characters really stand out. Instead, those who you talk to once in a while are those with the most memorable dialog and unique sense of humour - which is a neat change of pace.When you venture out in the singleplayer world it's easy to let go of what you were doing and just hunt for enemies only to use your skills, no matter what you specialize in at the time whether it be magic, archery, melee combat or all three. They are all equally as fun to play, even though the magic-system in this game is by far the most worked on.You conjure your own spells by using cards which you can combine in almost any way you can think of. You can create spells which summon creatures to fight for you, spells which summon tornados which in turn summons heavy steel anvils - at the same time as it's spinning around throwing the anvils all around the place. Or if you're more into projectiles you can create spells which shoot out several projectiles that are either homing or simply bounces through target to target hitting multiple enemies with only one projectile. OR; combine it all - projectile -> anvile summoning -> Tornado. Great fun!However, this game is not only about singleplayer, even though it's great fun. You can also join your friends on Multiplayer where the game turns into somewhat of a grind-fest and all you do - basically - is repeat mission in order to gain levels and increase the strength of your character. Yes, it's tedious.. But with the right people the multiplayer turns into a very much appreciated hang-out. You have several game-modes ranging from the typical story-mission style to sruvival and even town-management. Yes, you can build your bery own town/village and you have to manage it in order to keep your villagers happy. And you friends can join you in your village, to either help you out when you need to defend it or to see how you manage your village compared to theirs.There's also PvP in this game, but my experience with the PvP has been very bad which in the long run made me ignore it completely, so I'm not gonna comment on it.All in all it's a great game. The graphics are very dated since the game is old, but even though it looks ""bad"" it still delivers on key points; massive world(s), great environment, huge variety of enemies, great skill-set and system, basic crafting and upgrading system and more. It's a great game when you want to kill time or play something quick and easy with your friends.I've enjoyed every minute put into this game, and I believe some of you will as well. Not everyone - but some!			",64,2,4,10,9,1,12

												When you first start playing, the jerky camera work and non-intuitive movement/combat system might make you want to stop playing...you should follow that instinct. After you get through the interface's learning curve, you stumble on to an actually decent action-RPG. Think Gothic but without interesting characters or a world that makes you care about. While I realize that's not a glowing recommendation, most of the game is actually enjoyable. The side-quests are interesting, and there are some genuinely funny moments. Unfortunately, you're never really *in* the game, because conversations are abysmal. The voice-acting is very poor, as are the conversation animations. You have to constantly refer to your journal for synopses, because the in-game dialogue is sometimes borderline nonsensical and leaves one wondering what actually just happened. All that aside, it's perfectly possible to get tens of hours of solid gameplay out of this title...until you come to the final boss. I won't offer spoilers, but I will say that the mechanics of the final boss fight essentially toss aside all of the character building you've worked towards. The RPG elements die, only to be replaced by a clunky FPS/potion management test. Due to the game's refusal to let you save during the final battle, you will also be subjected to the final cutscreen each re-try (and there will be many, many re-tries if you actually want to win). In other words, it starts out clunky, gets decent without ever being really good, and then ends with the least enjoyable boss fight I've ever encountered in a game. I suppose the good news is that the characters are so unrelateable and uninteresting that I never felt compelled to power-through and beat the final boss, so on the positive side, at least you don't feel like you've lost too much if you never find out how the story ends. If you have to play the game, just stop at the final boss and look online for a final cutscreen.			",52,16,0,20,3,0,5

												The game itselft isn't too bad, its cheesy, controls bad and the voice acting is terrible, But the game is fun to play. The magic system is excellent and probably the best thing in the game. If you are use to cheap RPG's then go ahead and play it.The reason why I can't recommend this game is because of the terrible DRM that is tied to it, you have to fill out a form (name, address, phone number etc) and then put in a code that is emailed to you. Even worse still is that if you change any hardware in your system (even just adding a stick of RAM) you have to do it AGAIN. It only lets you do this 3 times until you are locked out from the game!..... Terrible buisness practice.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well I was pleasantly surprised. There is a lot going for this game and it really is an improvement on the first game in the series. I thought the main character was a hoot. I loved the very dry but funny comments he made throughout the game. I liked the side quests, they were interesting and entertaining and usually quite unpredictable in how they would turn out. I enjoyed the storyline, I certainly didn't want to stop playing until I got to the end and I was tempted to do a lot of side missions along the way. The horses were a bit of a fail (never around) as was fighting in the small corridors. Terrible camera angles meant I couldn't always see my character at all and he was getting stuck in corners and having the stuffing pummelled out of him while I blindly tried pressing keys trying to get him up and away from walls, corners or holes. The inventory was a bit of a mess, the idea of armour sets nice but it was too easy to dismantle an item and then when you switch armour sets find yourself left standing in the nuddy with only your bow and a small dagger. (Hehe)(Pun intended) I will say this. I would be replaying this game over and over if I had the option to play as a female. I wouldn't want to stop until I experienced all the classes and their armours/weapon combinations. I would also have been very interested in buying the dlc and/or any expansions. I think RPG developers should give serious consideration to us female gamers as consumers with spending power. I liked the game but playing as a male... there is no replay interest for me. Overall I'm glad I played this game though. It was fun!			",29,3,0,21,1,0,0

												+ LOTS of content+ Gorgeous world design+ The voice acting is bad (especially the main character's), but amusing at times+ One of the most interesting crafting systems (including magic) I've ever seen in an RPG+ Multiplayer has an interesting management mode+ Sailing mechanics are polished+ Challenging (due to some negative aspects, so take that part with a grain of salt)- Awful character models- Combat is clunky for a game of its generation- Combat feels unbalanced due to its clunkiness- Interface is not user friendly- Unoriginal and uninspiring plot and characters- Character creation with both genders and different races is only available on multiplayer- Game forces you to romance women and be a shameful womanizer- Horse riding- No tutorials for some important aspects, such as the hotkeysVerdict: This is actually my second review for this game. I feel like many people didn't understand my first, so here's a second one, more simple to understand. First of all, yes, Two Worlds 2 is not a polished game. Is not your Bethesda RPG (although their games are still very buggy, the mechanics are solid), nor it tries to be. TW2 is awful in many aspects, but it shines in others and it can be a very enjoyable experience if you can deal with its flaws. It does its own thing and it's good enough at it, being 100% worth the PRICE AT DISCOUNTS (I think I paid something around USD4,00 for the Velvet Edition). I wouldn't recommend it at full price, but for more than 30h of gameplay to explore such an interesting and beautiful world, it certainly is worth the bargain I paid for it.Oh, and btw! The DRM is not as concerning as some people put it. It is offensive, but you DO NOT have to give accurate information (I didn't and it worked out alright). Just put something random there, or skip it entirely (yes, you don't have to go through that at all if you don't like it). In all honestly, there are worse DRMs to be worried about out there, like Denuvo, whatever Blizzard uses in Diablo 3 and whatever EA has and will use.			",136,41,2,31,7,1,10

												NOTE: Even if you don't read this review, I suggest you read this note. Most of the people that downvoted this game have less than an hour in the game. On the other hand, a lot of the people that said they enjoyed the game actually spent time and played it for a few hours. Keep that in mind as you scroll through the reviews and pay attention to which people have actually played the game rather than those who watched the opening cinematic and quit. That's all; thanks for reading.Review:At the time of writing this, I've only thrown about 10 hours into the game, but so far it's been quite fun. I bought the velvet edition on sale for something like $5, but I have yet to play the DLC. For a quick summary, this game is very open world and free-form. The tutorial is really the only part so far that forces you to take a specific path. GAMEPLAY:TL;DR:-Combat is a bit clunky but it's still fun. Plenty of customization and upgrades. If you use a controller, the aiming is pretty rough but you get used to it pretty quickly. There is actually an auto-aim option but I turned it off so I couldn't tell you if it's any good. Plenty of places and items to find. You can sell or break excess materials into pieces for upgrading your gear, too.Explanation:-Maybe this is a pro, maybe this is a con but the game has an interesting, albeit probably not intended, platforming mechanic that allows you to sequence-break pretty easily and skip some quests that you would otherwise need in order to progress (but you would miss the xp and items from them if you did). I usually end up trying to skip things and then go back to complete the quest anyway just for the gold and xp. In some places, you actually have to use it to reach some hidden items which are fairly useful.-The combat is certainly nothing to compare to the likes of skyrim but it's not terrible. You can use a range of melee weapons, bows, magical staves and upgrade them in a few ways. The game allows you to sort of ""counter-attack"" after blocking a string of hits, which I quite like. You are also provided with a few moves such as a guard breaking attack to knock shielding opponents back and you unlock several more as you progress. The spell system is interesting and I appreciate the novelty in the system used for this game. Essentially, you have several cards for making unique spells. You can mix and match and nothing is permanent, so you can change them at any time (even mid-fight). You have effect types, area of effect, buffs, projectiles and modifiers for damage, attack type, etc. There is plenty of customization for magic users. The bows are pretty simple. You have a few abilities like different arrow types, multishot, long range, ect.-Also, the game has plenty of loot to grab, locks to pick, fencegates to leap over. You can hunt animals in the wild and use their drops for lots of things like healing, buffs, alchemy, etc. On another note, I encountered a table for gambling with dice and it seems really easy to win almost every time. I played maybe 6 or 7 times and won 5 of them. All around, it's a good fun and there are plenty of other things to do even in the first town.STORY:-Haven't been through the entire story yet, but it's pretty standard. Some evil guy has your sister and you need to go rescue her and do a bunch of things along the way. That's really as far as I've been. The voice acting is hilariously unnatural and the character animations during speech are no different.DECISION:-Haven't played much, but for the first 10 hours it's been a good time. Certainly worth the price I got it for, but maybe even the full 20.00. If you like RPG's and old, slightly-buggy games then try it out. If you can catch the game when it's on sale, I would surely recommend playing it. I wouldn't necessarily choose to buy this game over another similar game. But, if you've got the cash and extra time on a weekend or whatever, then it's worth checking out.Thanks for reading my review,James			",129,13,0,9,12,0,1

												It's a pretty average RPG through most of the game with some interesting mechanics.  It offers my favorite lockpicking mini game of all time and crafting was alright as well.  Some awful mechanics like pickpocketing as well, the one quest where you're required to pickpocket I gave up and murdered everyone involved. I still got rewarded for ""pickpocketing"" the bodies.  I hear crafting magic is amazing as well but I didn't go that route. That said, after slugging through about 60 hours of gameplay, exploring the world and being rewarded for playing a terrible character, I reached the final boss.  All of your character progression is meaningless.  Regardless of your HP, fire immunity, and Melee skill, this boss will remove a third of your HP with every shot and remain airborne requiring either a magic affinity that is strong enough to damage the final boss but not strong enough to crash the game (I read this one on the internet as respecking is an option, it may have been patched) or the use of the ballista inexplicably placed on top of the bosses tower.  I tried multiple times to beat the boss but, after I reduced its HP to less than a third, it started using an undodgeable attack which always reduced my HP down to Zero.  It took me 3 tries to realize it might be a bug and abandon the game. Topware also has some aggressive DRM, requiring personal information like your full name, address, and phone number to enable the save feature.  I got a bundle with 3 Tripwire games in it, all 3 of them having the same requirements for personal information.			",254,83,9,57,31,3,84

												Two Worlds 2 is a good game, but it is not a great game. I really liked the first Two Worlds and TW2 is almost as good, but there are a few things that really bothered me. The controls seem like they were made for a console game and at times it is rather difficult to have good control with mouse and keyboard even with customization. E.g. run, block and sneak are all on the same key, often causing confusion in the heat of battle (it is less than ideal when you are trying to get some space between you and an attacker and you end up trying to block instead).The game also clearly seems to give meelee fighters an advantage over casters and archers. My favorite play style is that of a stealthy archer. You can not do that in this game. Sneak attacks can only be done with daggers. Archery in general is rather difficult as the auto aim can not be turned off and it does not know how to aim ahead of a moving target, causing even a high level archer to constantly miss even low level and even slow moving targets from relatively close distance. It is a bit better with sniper mode from a great distance (where auto aim does not lock), but it is really annoying nevertheless. Also there is no first person mode, so your characters elbow tends to get into the way, blocking your view of enemies. Finally there were also quite a few bugs (dialogue skipping, and wrong shaders getting loaded occasionally, among others) that cost this game points.On the positive side, I really enjoyed the story (which unfortunately felt a little rushed in the end) and the many side quests all of which are well written and entertaining.  The crafting system is simple and fun. I loved the lack of classes and the freedom to customize your character skills. There is a lot to explore and discover, which is always nice. The graphics are quite good, though not outstanding for todays standards. All in all a good game for RPG players looking for something to spend some time on. I got it for a real bargain around Christmas and I would definitely recommend it for that price. I would not buy it for the full 19,90 it is costing right now, though. Better wait for another special again.			",41,44,0,11,3,0,12

												I love this game.It is a huge game with interesting quests and sidequests that take you all throughout Antaloor! Its crafting system is great, although you can't make new items, you can break apart others to upgrade items.  The magic system is FANTASTIC! It is much like magicka. You take runes with different abilities like fire, water, earth, etc. then make your own spell, projectile, charm, summon, or whatever.I explored this whole game in singleplayer and enjoyed it, but it even has a multiplayer which is just icing on the cake. It is much like an MMO with people in the server doing their own things. It is co op but also offers a deathmatch mode. There are missions, shops, and roles to play in online.This is a great game and I really recommend it. The only thing I didn't like was the final boss, but didn't really care because I was too busy having a great time 55 hours in one playthrough. Didn't even do all the sidequests. Still a ton to explore.			",192,13,6,22,10,0,15

												Good game destroyed by horrible anti-piracy measures. I have to reenter details everytime i log in. Unacceptable in the current day and age.I simply cannot recommend the game because of that.Besides,1. The control interface is horrible2. Voice Acting is well... Unethusiastic to say the least3. Graphics look like well....♥♥♥♥♥♥ (Even for an old game)I wouldn't even recommend the game at 75% sale, much least at full price. The only time I would consider even getting it would be when it is at like 90% off. Don't waste your money and your time. This is one of the games better left untouched.			",29,4,0,2,1,0,2

												Can't get the game to launch.  Instantly crashes, no matter what options selected in the launcher.  Only game in a library of 200+ titles that crashes on launch.  This title is total garbage, and I want a refund.  Better yet, yank this POS from the store.  It took me a few minutes to figure out how to even get a review in for a title that won't launch.  I suspect that there are many other users having the same problem, but who are not able to write reviews for games that won't launch.I see a fanboy of the game spamming forums with links to the nvidia physx legacy driver as some sort of panacea for everybody's problem.  If that's the case, then the game devs have not bundled the game's dependencies in the installer, which is well below any normal level of quality that we should expect from a steam-distributed title.

												Well i can surely say that this game is a really underrated gem.Is funny, huge and addicting.Yes,maybe is not an AAA production but is worth playing for sure.Combat system is pretty funny indeed, and the spell creation mechanics are something i've never seen in a third person RPG.There are various playstyles possibilities: stealth assassin,mage spammer :D ,archer or a brute tank vanquisher.Weapons and gears are in a good amount and the simple crafting system is well made too,with the possibility to recolour your armours.You can ride horses, play dices, sail and also PLAY DIFFERENT SONGS WITH VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS to get some money from the crowd in cities with a minigame similar to guitar hero. Man wtf you have to try this.Enemies are various and in huge amounts but sometimes are a little dumb. Fortunately a mod can easily repair this issue (read below for more info).The story is pretty long, not worth an Oscar prize but still enjoyable and there are tons of secondary (and funny) quests to do.The multiplayer is placed on another big map,different from the main game and you can play a good co-op campaign and pvp as well. Few players still online but luckily its not dead.But, if you want to squeeze the game to the maximum i suggest you to download the WorldMerge MOD from here {LINK REMOVED}http://www.mediafire.com/file/hb3qyopabhysz54/Worldmerge+1.3b+setup.exe .This mod will (as the name suggests) merge the single player and the multiplayer world  and quests in a single HUGE world to explore. It also adds high level brand new enemies, bossess and weapons, corrects some issues with ui, improves the AI and some other minor but useful tweaks.Last but not least my vote: 8,5I think that a real RPG player MUST try this game, at least when on sale. Really worth your time.The DLC Pirates of the Flying Fortress is another HUGE addition to this game. get it in bundle when on sale too.P.S. TOPWARE WE ARE WAITING FOR CALL OF THE TENEBRAE!!

												I am playing this game and just can't get enough!Seriously, it is visually stunning.  I think it may be because they designed it for 3D.  Even though I cannot play it in 3D, I can feel the graphic design quality.Characters are mostly well acted.  The spell system is very creative.  You can combine different modifiers that custom alter your spells, but many times applying the alterations creates completely different spells altogether.The game allows you to quickly switch between three different outfits with the touch of a button.  I didn't think I would like this at first, but it allows me to play warrior, mage, and archer/sneak as the situation allows.  I have specialized gear for all three roles and it actually works.  It has really creative quests without being the go and fetch variety.  When the rare occasion of running errands arises, the story line has a compelling reason and makes you want to do it.  If you like old-school, dark, un-mapping (as in you need graph paper) dungeons, there is  a unique challenge in chapter one that lets you try your hand at it.  It is not necessary for the story line, so that is optional.I'm a huge fan of Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim.  It's no Elder Scrolls, but I would give it a 90/100.  Whatever bugs existed at release have been smoothed out for the Steam version and the game hasn't given me a single problem for over 70 hours of play.And it is huge!  I am in the middle of the second chapter with much left to go.  I am a person that does every little quest, so I figure I have about 100 hours left in this thing.I have no idea why I never heard of this game and don't hear people talking about it.Have fun with this hidden treasure!

												A very solid RPG for the most part, with a crafting system second to none. It is not without it's rough edges however, and you'll want to play it on the hardest setting to help guard against your almost Godlike attributes too early in the game. The voice-acting is cringe worthy at times, but it is ok for the most part, and the ai can be extremely predictable and too easily defeated on normal and lower difficulties.The greatest strength of TW2 is that it get's more right than it get's wrong, and it is all packaged in very good looking graphical wrapping. It is just a blast to play - period, at least for me, and this alone should be enough for any fan of open world RPG's. Make no mistake, this is NOT Skyrim, but it is a very adequate and capable RPG that will keep you questing, looting, and killing, for dozens and dozens of hours.Get the Velvet Edition. The DLC is spectacular, and is almost better in many regards than the base game - just not as long obviously.Base game = 8.5/10Velvet Edition = 9.0/10Disclaimer:No animal or Human was harmed in the making of this - opinion.

												Just finished the game and... well, now this is a hard one to review...Do i recommend it? yes, but...and it's a pretty big BUT.Overall the game is pretty decent, but it does have a lot of flaws.The first few hours i absolutely hated the controls, but i got used to it.The graphics are still quite decent for a 2011 game. The voice acting varies from very mediocre to actually quite well.Quests vary from poorly written from actually quite well.Combat feels weird, but once you unlock skills it's really not too bad and can be quite fun.I went melee, but i believe a mage could be a lot more fun if you look at the possibilities.The story is better than i expected, but it still leaves much to be desired.The ending also has some serious plot holes if you ask me.The open world is kinda nice to explore, but still too bland. I much prefer the worlds of the Risen/gothic series (games which are comparable). At one point you get a boat, it works well... but it's actually completely useless.I found the Swamp act quite fun and interesting, but the last act was a grinding bore.I could go on a long time about this game, but this sums it up pretty well . I went from ""meh, wtf is this"" to ""damn, this game is quite fun"" all the time. Sometimes i couldn't stop playing, other times i didn't know if i was going to finish it. You can feel the game was too ambitious and they didn't pull everything off.I had fun playing through it overall. If you see it on sale and don't have too high expectations, it can be fun. Just don't expect something like The witcher series. If you can see past its flaws, it's pretty decent and fun.But really, i have had rarely such mixed feelings about a game.I can't comment on the MP part because i haven't tried it yet.

												<please ignore my playtime, i played abut 100 hours more during an internet downtime>Two Worlds II is one of my all time favourite RPG's. You can choose the way you want your character, and the way you want to evolve. You can become a mace wielding mage or a bow using berserker - its totally up to you! The playable areas are huge - very huge. You can scout and kill every area you like, enter any of the dungeons you find (except for a very few where you need a key for). The main quest line is very comprehensive, there are countless side quest and a huge amount of dungeons. While the story might not be the best you have experienced, it is still interesting and made me want to play more and more and more. The game includes a ton of different kind of weapons, spells and skills. Again, its totally up to the player to choose which of these he wants to learn/use. The combat is quite basic, but fun nontheless. A few downsides: - requires registration- takes away your rl- graphic pretty old for todays standards (still enjoyable)- the Multiplayer is a) dead and b) badOverall, i still recommend this game. (one of the best parts: The Labyrinth side quests. Looking for the tomb inside a labyrinth, only equipped with.... either a weapon or a torchlight. There is no light source anywhere to be found. You need to finish about 10 of those. Totally awesome) ",561,189,17,68,47,2,97

												This game also stands out as having the worst DRM I've experienced. Its DRM currently blocks legit customers from playing the game. Having a steam key is not good enough and the user also has to activate the game through phone or online registration.That doesn't sound bad enough right? Well, this activation process needs to be re-done every time you change your hardware (e.g. replace RAM or install in a different computer). Still not bad enough? You are only allowed to re-activate 3 times in total.In terms of game quality though, I'd say it's second or third rate. It's not bad but also not something extremely memorable. You wouldn't miss much if you skip this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Two Worlds II is a very nice open-world RPG game, Its a good substitute to Skyrim. Well, it obviously is not as good as Skyrim ,yet it has its own qualities, The unique quality was the magic system, where we can create our own spells and experiment with them, well that's better than learning a destruction spell by simply opening a book. It has varying landscapes such as A Desert, A Swamp, Dense forest, Asian city, Dark ruins , Islands. etc.  But the story is meh! specially the ending, the main quest is good as well as the side quests, but there are huge number of these kind of quests of many of them are fetch quests which tends to get boring after completing many. Tried the multiplayer a bit, its simple you can alone do a quest or with your friend, and there are different modes like death match etc.  I heard the multiplayer will be disabled soon, hope it dosent. I may have missed some points like fighting mechanics and crafting system which are ""OK"" at best! Its not an amazing rpg but it is a good one, and would have been a great one if the storyline was good. My rating - 8/10			",635,178,16,88,36,3,58

												I have heard and read many reviews about this game and it has been very mixed.First off I will say I brought this game in a sale for £2. Therefore making this game a visually pleasing and fun to play. I haven't encountered any bugs, so, so far so good. The game lacks 'something' but cant put my finger on what that 'something' is. The keyboard mapping is confusing such as sprint and sneak are the same button. You need to stand still and press RMB for sneak and move and press RMB to sprint. So the keyboard layout it a bit weird. The prologue took 45 minutes to complete... I think 1 hour ingame until I was able to free roam! However once you get to free roam it can be very enjoyable, there map is relitevly large and you do get a horse about 3 hours of gameplay in.. The map doesnt require a horse though as you recieve a teleport pad at the end of the prologue so you can fast travel to locations you've already discovered.Make sure you keep up with you crafting and enchanting as you level up rather quickly, therefore so do you foes. So dont do a me and get slaughtered and wonder why... ""Oh, I am using a damage 10 sword when I couldve upgraded it to 40 by now.""Once you understand what you're doing in the game, such as how to craft and how to dismantle items to game becomes rather enjoybale. I havent played too much of the story to give a verdict, but on the whole for £2, I am really enjoying this game, I would say the game is worth about... £6. I wouldnt spend more than that, when Skyrim is only about £10 these days. (I have a MAC so this was my alternative to Skyrim).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Massively addictive game. Cannot get enough of it, something about upgrading weapons, armor & gems just keeps me interested. The combat system, when you get used to it, is very rewarding and fun - while I still face some challenges I do feel like a badass now that I have properly levelled up and use the right gems, armor and weapons. Decided to go full warrior class so packed everything into strength and a little into endurance. Pros:1. The quests are WAY more interesting than some of the typical RPG quests with some pretty entertaining and, dare I say, mature storylines. 2. The graphics & sound is absolutely remarkable.3. Variety of things to do i.e. tomb raiding, fighting, hunting, horse riding, sailing, upgrading items, shopping etc. (keeps me entertained for long periods of time). 4. As stated in my opening remarks, the combat system is fantastic and if attacks are timed with defense the results are some excellent fighting routines. The enemies also have certain defense such as blunt force vs cutting damage so when facing say a Skeleton it is better to use a hammer than a sword. It is important to see / know what your enemies are ""immune to"" so changing weapons is a must to quickly end fights, especially when surrounded (something which the Witcher series uses i.e. silver vs steel) 5. While I am full on warrior, should I wish to switch to range (rogue) or magick (mage) I can use a soul patcher and simple respec my character. 6. The magick system from what I have seen (not experienced myself yet, is the best in it's class - more like Oblivion than Skyrim - where custom made spells are possible, only your imagination is the limit.7. The different areas are amazing from totally unique (lush islands with gorgeous flora which reacts to your movements, the savana, the deserts, the dungeons, the old ruins, the swallows etc.) each region feels totally unique with even the music adapting accordingly. Cons:1. You can see in some instances that the budget behind this game vs other more well know games is less, not based on sound or graphics but rather things like path finding for enemies which can be pretty dumb at times. 2. AI is somethings lacking (and here is a pro tip for folks in the early game) where the enemies have a limited chase distance where they simply reach the edge of this limit and will sometimes just stand there and take arrow or magick damage until they die. (Which was especially useful when facing the giant scorpions for the first time although I did feel a little dirty using this game glitch)3. Probably as a result of the first point but some of the caves / dungeons are reused but not nearly as bad as Dragon Age 24. Possibly a tad challenging in the early stages so kiting is recommended (hit and run tactics) I honestly cannot think of why this game has some negative reviews but have noticed that most, if not all are well under 10 hours of gameplay ergo they probably got smashed trying to button mash enemies. This game deserves a 9 out of 10 easily but not being a big budget & influential development house who can pay of the mainstream reviewers I guess it gets a bad rep.Get it and immerse yourself in something trully rewarding - you will not regret it.

												the whole thing boils down to 3 horrible game choices:1. the horrible registration.2. the combat which does not require any skill and involves you clicking randomely and hoping you dont get hit (which you will). There is no skill involved and no most enemies will wreck you in seconds. Also im gonna put the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ horse in here too. they tried to make it realistic by having you have to kick it to move (like in real life) but its overly clunky and you can't seem to get the high jump you need to vault over obstacles. They also mapped dismounting and jumping to the same key which means im jumping repeatedly when i want to get off. I know you need to wait for the energy bar to go down on the horse but it just makes it even more of a clunky decision3. some of the most awkward animations ive seen in a while. this is 2011 and i know this was outdated back then			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game for 0,52 EUR and I was pleasantly surprised how good this game actually is.Pros:- sophisticated game mechanics (magic, crafting, etc,... )- pretty neat graphic visuals, a lot of objects reacts to physics which is nice touch- magic crafting is really interesting and creating your own spells is fun- multiplayer (but have some cons), you can own a village thats a pretty interesting feature too- interesting locations, nice level design- you can have a boatCons:- controls arent that great character doesnt responde always that how would you thought- multiple actions are set on one button which leads to unwanted deaths because instead of running you character starts sneaking (but you will get used to it)- multiplayer - have no open world so you can only play adventures and after that there is not much to do ( there is a really lost potential in MP )- open world with restriction, You're on islands and you have to complete certain quests to get to the next island- not really interesting storySummary:Two Worlds II is a great game with a huge potencial that was kinda wasted. But still it is a game where you can spend many hours and having fun. Also you can try multiplayer with you friends which also offers a lot of hours of fun. So far I can highly recommend it.

Pity, that it's not perfect.I will not deny that I have a big problem with making a proper review for Two Worlds II. On the one hand, the game has a lot of annoying shortcomings which♥♥♥♥♥♥me off because they were already present in first part. On the other hand, over time, this game spreads their wings and becomes a tasty morsel for all fans of unusual quests and collecting a myriad of items, trades, alchemy, etc.. Some little things irritate (eg. A completely custom keyboard shortcuts, poor access to maps, dumb enemies), while others cause a banana on the face (ingenious minigame to open locks, interesting quests). Accents, both the good and the poor ones are distributed in Two Worlds II almost exactly equally. Thus, according to simple mathematics, I should have put the game five points. However, due to some undefined sympathy that I have for these series mercifully I will raise the assessment by one point.PROS:An interesting questsSolid storylineDecent graphicsGreat cutscenes and videosLots of itemsAlchemy and craftsExcellent locks openingCONS:Poor interfaceFatal mapWeak diaryUnusual keyboard shortcutsAI errorsHorse ridingMinor bugs ",270,47,11,25,15,1,25

												Two Worlds is one of the most critically maligned video game series of all time, I'm here to tell you why that's unfair, and why you shouldn't cheat yourself out of this experience.But first we must list the cons:Dated graphics (understandable for a 6 year old game at time of writing, but they lacked fidelity even at launch)Numerous bugs and glitchesShoddy animationsShoddy voice actingPoor multiplayerTwo Worlds has always been a series that lacks a certain amount of polish, the first game using in-house staff as voice actors because they couldn't afford professional talent, is just one example. While I personally enjoyed the first game for reasons I won't divulge in this review, many did not, however Two Worlds II is proof that the developers at Topware have improved upon themselves.So onto the pros:Expansive worldFantastic combat systemRich and fulfilling lootT H I C C atmosphereI recommend Two Worlds II because it stands as a monument to video game innocence, it is honest in its presentation, and flawed. But its flaws while often frustrating are part of the allure, and the game handles certain aspects of its creation very very well. To me, Two Worlds was the first game to utilise really satisfying hack and slash gameplay, it's heavy, but not too heavy, light where it needs to be, but not floaty (like Skyrim, and it is varied; Two Worlds has always had TONS of weapons and armour types. It is a precursor to the combat Demon Souls created, but far less punishing and enjoyable. Exploring the world of Two Worlds II might not have the same recognisable landmarks and features of classic games like TES, or The Witcher, but the detailed and varied environments make for an enjoyable romp on horseback with some of the most satisfying mounted combat since Mount and Blade.The charm of Two Worlds lies in the moments the developers at Topware hit the nail on the head, it is a game that is so so close to achieving perfection, but is let down by developer inexperience. What is encouraging however, is that Two Worlds II was such an improvement over the first (and already enjoyable) game, that with this trend, Two Worlds III could be even greater, and that excites me a great deal.So do buy Two Worlds II, if you are a forgiving gamer, who isn't looking for a polished AAA title. Buy it if you're looking for an experience, with ups and downs.If you're looking for the perfection of a multi-million dollar budget then you may want to look elsewhere, or at least wait for Two Worlds III, maybe that will be the one.

												Decided to give the game a chance after all positive reviews, and it was worth it. Overall well-executed and solid (not what you would expect of Two Worlds franchise, huh?) Though it has it downsides, of that below. But short summary - yes, the game is good.Two Worlds 2 in many ways reminds me of Gothic series. Free roaming, ability to climb rocks, ability to beat strong enemies, loot and steal everything, sensible NPCs and a right feel of progression. Not exactly there, but this is the best experience in open-world RPGs I've got since those times. On top of that, excellent graphics and animations (oh, pity that with such great combat animations game has such crappy combat mechanics!) and good story and side quests - you feel involved and always have a reason to intervene.Bad things. 1) The redundant key entering and invasive registration form (do not fill that, it's unnecessary!). Almost ragequite after some unsuccesful registration attempts; thankfully, continued. No drm-client, at least. 2) The game claims to be open-world, but in fact you are limited to plot zones, though they are large and free to roam. And there is next to nothing to explore outside of key locations. So it's more correct to perceive this game as story-driven RPG, but without rails and corridors. 3) Game is exploitable in a lot of ways. Kiting, click spamming, paralizing, poor aggro handling, patrol limits - all of that makes combat unchallengeable and boring. Having tons of health of the enemies doesn't help with boring. Heard there are mods that improve combat and difficulty level, but haven't tried them.Overall, the game was fun. Little grindy, but I don't mind to kite mobs a little - loot is good as a reward. Good controls, freedom to go, believable world, good story and quests. Good thing I have an addon, can experience the game a little more.And, of course, 10/10 for being eaten by umbrella!

												This is one of the most underrated games I have ever played. Before I started playing, I read all those mixed reviewes, but after approx. 45 hours of gameplay, I have to admit this game is awesome.  - great graphics (considering the release date, which is 2010)  - interesting main/side quests, often very very funny, with many twists and surprises  - cultural links related to non-game environment (e.g. Monthy Python and the Holy Grail - scene with the dark knight)  - number of activities you can do, e.g. playing musical instruments, crafting, brewing potions, purchasing estates, riding    a horse etc.Weak side of this game is definitely inventory management (and usert interface in general), which is absolute disaster, its chaotic and you have to click number of times to get want you want...However if you have enjoyed Gothic series, Risen series, Skyrim, this game is definitely worth buying.

												While not the greatest game out, it took me by surprise. I purchased an RPG bundle because of a game in the mix that I thought looked enjoyable, Two Worlds II came with it and the videos looked alright.I have quite a bit of experience when it comes to RPGs and gaming in general working on developing my own games, software, etc.. over the years. If I could change one purchase I made at full price, I would've pre-ordered this game at full price rather than buy Arcania ( Gothic 4 ) on pre-order; never again from that company. Gothic 4 is one of the worst games, it is so full of bugs that you can't even walk down a small slope because you keep hitting invisible walls that stops you befor letting you continue. Two Worlds II is actually quite refined.I haven't played it in a while, but I ended up buying it 3 times ( One bundle had the standard edition, and the Pirates DLC, and then I bought another bundle with the Epic edition, then once for a friend because I enjoyed it so much ). I'd buy it again.There are a few downsides to the game, but they're so minimal I can't even remember them.This game seems very polished, I may have encountered a bug that I couldn't replicate. Gameplay is smooth, combat is simple when you get used to it, the controls don't feel clunky like Gothic 4 ( where you can spam pick-up and the character does 20 squats before picking up the item and where hitting enemies is a chore ).I'd rate this to be almost as much fun as Skyrim. The game has plenty of side-quests, twists, and more. I don't recall whether or not I cleared out 100% of the game, but at over 100 hours of time in game says something. The price I paid wouldn't have even gotten me a movie ticket, or a popcorn at the movies, at that was with buying it 3 times; For a game from 2011, it definitely plays quite well.If you think the price of a few coffees, a movie ticket, or a few soft-drinks is worth it, consider the cost to entertainment value for a game like this and buy it. If you're on the fence about the $20 price-tag, wait until it is on sale ( the bundle sites still have it too at a steal ) but at $10, it is more than worth it.			",667,159,38,97,82,7,124

												First, to the paranoiac reviewers fearing the DRM's information requirements: Calm your♥♥♥♥♥♥ There was nothing requested that is any more than what your local pizza delivery place likely has on you.On to the review:Beginner tutorials are so uninformative that the NPC training you will give you a book in whichever skill (alchemy, spell casting, etc.) to cover the information the designers knew they failed to address properly to begin with.Stiff, halting dialogue from bad voice actors.(E.G. Thome the Scribe sounds like Droopy Dog with a Southern drawl.)Stiff character models combined with loose joystick and limited/ unimaginative controls make combat feel like a sloppy button masher.About half the mobs I encountered died too easy and the other half were damage sponges and others simply stood there until my firebolts killed them.Spell types (Elemental types, Necromancy, Summoning, etc.) require books to learn and then certain card types to combine into an amulet for castable spells. For instance, you could select an element card like Fire and then combine with a ""carrier"" card such as Bolt, Spray or Area Effect.Having determined I would play as a mage type, I originally thought this was implemented nicely but then I was finding next to no books or cards except random rotations on vendors, which charged an exhorbitant sum when and if they even had anything I could use.Screwy quests that are nonsensical even beyond the played-out fetch quests common to RPG games.Example:The first town I came to was Bayan.Within the first couple of minutes, I had three people beg me for meat, as there is a drought and all the villagers were starving.I give them each a piece of meat and one sends me to the village leader, who has a sick horse.She sends me to kill ostriches in the Savannah to gut them for the mint roots they eat to create a cure.She doesn't ask for their meat for her starving village, just the roots.Heading out into said savannah, I find green grasses and trees with numerous Ostrich, Warthogs, Baboons, Cheetahs, Rhinos... A short walk out I find white sand beaches with crystal blue waters teeming with fish... all manner of tasty things to eat out there but these slack-jaws are starving for some reason.But they don't want you to hunt for them, they want you to cure the sick horse so you can ride it past all the delicious creatures of the field to beg for food from the next village over.After curing the horse, I rode off for the next village of the mind that the people of Bayan didn't even deserve continued existence if they could neither grow crops nor hunt nor fish in the midst of such abundance.My grand quest was later cut short when I was sent to the Orc mage and a bug kept him from responding to my attempts to speak with him.Just how bugged other quest NPC's may be further in, I do not know but frankly I was not drawn in enough to risk investing my time beyond the first bugged subject to find out.Overall, I would say even if I had not encountered the bugged NPC, I simply found this game lacking.It is unfortunate, as it feels as though it may have been on the right track at some point and somehow fell short of hitting the mark somewhere along the way.If you do choose to get it, make sure it is during a super cheap sale for 85% off, because it is certainly not worth the $19.99 standard price if you are risking game/quest/npc breaking bugs.

Also, take a better combat mechanic than any Elder Scrolls game, and add in the mix a sh*t ton of bugs and glitches that will make the experience enjoyable more than frustating.

 I really, really wanted to like this game. I've tried playing it a few years ago and I tried playing it now. Turns out it's the most problematic game of all time. The gameplay itself doesn't seem half bad - it has decent animations, a great story and is deeply engaging but it's also very unpolished. It has a lot of potential.The reason why I  dislike  the game so much is because it's unplayable. You turn on the game and it asks you to give your serial number. Then, it asks you to activate your serial number by giving your very personal details such as: your adress, full name, email, phone number, zipcode etc. After you're done doing that, the game tells you to write down the activation key you received on your e-mail and then asks you to type in your serial number  AGAIN . This time it's a serial number for a DLC (only if you bought it along with the game) which you also need to activate aferwards! The game crashed multiple times when I finally got to play it and each time I opened it, I had to re-do the whole process of activating and typing in my serial number.  It's probably not very hard to imagine that I requested a refund.  ",185,69,1,26,14,1,19

												Ok this game is pretty great if you ask me for one reason the magic system. If you like being a mage in any rpg go for this game. you literly can do everything from make spells to break locks to make speels to make twisters. I say make because the whole magic system is really detailed (if hard to get) card  system. You will at first think why the hell am I traped with a lousy fire spell even though im a level 10. Then when you sstart to get cards you start thinking ok I have a ton of cards but I dont know how to make anything usefull. Then the fun starts because soon you will start experimenting and make insane combos like summon ice then make it sorround you like a sheild. So if your a mage go for it. If you ar a warrior it is your typical stuff but you can upgrad your weapons yourself but still go mage!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Two Worlds II has one of the most interesting magic systems I have seen in an RPG for a long time. Instead of ""This is your new spell"" you actually have to gather components and combine in whatever way you want to build spells that do whatever you want. And air bolt can change into and slow fall, or even a rain of anvils. It is slightly OP once you have 5 or even 10 summoned creatures guarding you though... I mention this first because that was the most interesting part of the start of the game for me, and it's what I kept playing for. Once I got into the story, and especially the side quests, I found a world with plenty of humour and secrets including (but not limited to): Man eating umbrellas, undead lovers, giving impromtue lectures and gambling underworlds.

												I play with game with the ""world merge mod"". I bought this game because I was looking for a skyrim/oblivion/fallout 3 NV/fallout 3/mass effect type experience. There is:-Bad Voice Acting-Sometimes AI gets stuck on objects-Inventory and selling system isn't the best, can't buy multiple items at once-Summoned creates can't be moved out of the way, causing major clutter in some levels. Without a wait system, this becomes tedious at some points when you're stuck in a sewer waiting for your summoned creatures to dissapear. Pros:-Quests that are a bit more in depth than ""go get x"", probably on par with skyrim but not as deep as NV-Best Magic system I've seen, card system gives alot of different spell abilities-Small differences in levels are significant, makes you move around the map alot becuase you can't cheese high level enemies for exp.This game isn't as good as the above mentioned, but if you've already played the above mentioned games and are looking for the old school RPG experience, I'd buy this game.8/10 if looking for skyrim experience7/10 in general  ",18,0,0,12,5,0,7

												Lots of negative reviews for this title, and somewhat undeservedly I think. Fine, I had to register before I could play. That's hardly on the scale of the asshattery that is the UPlay client now is it?Although I enjoyed Two Worlds, it had a few flaws, especially in regards to inventory management and crafting. Fortunately, Two Wolds II improves this and it is much better, although I wish some parts of it were streamlined - felt like I spent half my time melting items I had no use for, waiting for stupid ♥♥♥♥ing animations to complete so I could upgrade items, and tedisouly selling necklaces and rings which otherwise take up space for no good reason.It's not a bad RPG, the story line wasn't the best (OMG I must save my sister! After I go win a few fights, do some horse races, pick some flowers, etc etc), but there was lots of quests, places to go and things to see, with a wide variety of skills, weapons and armour. The magic system seems interesting too, although as always I played a warrior character, with ranged backup. One of these days I'll actually play an RPG as a squishy. Maybe.While the open world areas had a bit of variety, I was bored sensless by the dungeons. Many were repetiive with the same sections of caves etc, and all were dull dull dull.Graphically, it's nothing special, and while the different regions have their unique appearances, it's a bit bland and repetitive.Audio is hit and miss. I really disliked how my character tended to chuckle like a homicdal maniac after killing a foe or made some other stupid comment. I especially found it irratating when I'd enter a place I'd been before, and the character would remark ""now where does this go""... erm, you've been here before dumbass.Combat is OK, ish. You don't have a huge amount of options really, although giving someone a fistfull of arrows is generally entertaining. Some mobs are resistant to certain things, but overall it didn't make much of a difference. Balance was odd, the boss fights seem to ramp to a scale of difficulty that didn't match anything else and it was very noticable. However, that could also be becuase you are expected to use the alchemy system, and being the hoarder that I am, I didn't want to waste materials inventing pots. The only pot I made turned out to be poison resistance which eventually came in handy for one fight. Definitely should have tried that one more.I also played the Pirates expansion. Although it started off fairly OK (and I really enjoyed being able to carry on my character with all his XP, items and skills), the last part of the game was an absolute pile of crap and I really hated it. Mind you, it didn't start off on the best foot when they used a different actor for the main character and the voices sound totally dissimilar.While Gothic probably remains my all time favorite RPG, this one isn't too bad either and I look forward to the third game in the series.Hit and miss in many respects, but overall more enjoyable than not, completed the base game and the first expansion.

												At heart its a solid RPG with all the classic elements. In playing it though, it always feels like its missing something. The inventory feels clunky, the skills feel weak and the quests just don't seem to clearly fit together. I played a long way into it, 60+ hours, but I did not come away with a feeling that I would recommend it unless you are really needing your RPG fix.Personally RPGs like Witcher, Dragon Age, Risen and the first Drakensang felt better put together.

												While the graphics are lack-luster, it may have been a fun game if it didn't require you to jump through hoops just to ""register"" and ""activate"" it. Save your money and buy a game that you can actually fire up and play when you want.			",154,21,3,12,9,1,19

												I'll be honest...Not the nicest game you can find.Graphics and textures are kinda good but every thing else is just bad.HUD is one of those HUDs which makes you just wanna quit the gamePoorly done voice acting.Combat is cool. Not very challenging but nice animations.Poor plot.SUMIf it is on sale, I say 'Yeah, maybe...'.If it is not,'F♥♥♥ it'.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A lot of unjust reviews for this game. I picked it up  the collection for a few $ and its worth the money 10 times over. Hundreds of hours of gameplay, the environments are stunning and the enemies are countless. People just love to troll, few individulas ever weigh the pros and cons. If you did, pros outweigh the cons by far, with that in mind you couldn't honestly write a scathing review with a genuinly displeased expression on you pain in the♥♥♥♥♥mug.  In saying that, some people have a point. Voice acting is tediously boring and laughable. The combat in clunky, but not as horrible as the reviews would have you believe. Definetly worth buying if it's on sale. No doubt about that.			",36,8,0,11,3,1,10

												** the groaning about the DRM is nonsense, it can be bypassed by unchecking a box, and if people would read it says Steam users have unlimited keys, people don't pay attention they just complain **If you like older style RPG games that are not going to be completed in a day, this is the right game for you.  I would highly recommend getting it on sale because it's got some issues that make it a little frustrating at times but it is overall a very fun game. The open world design is fun, the characters are pretty fun in their own right.  Despite the glitches with the game it is still a game I enjoy playing and have been playing non-stop since I got it.  Make sure you get the expansion DLC along with it as it is a great compliment to the game, in fact I would say it's better than the first part but shorter.  Who doesn't like pirates... So for $2.74 with the DLC I feel like I got more than my moneys worth.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do NOT buy Two Worlds 1 OR 2 on steam or as box! Not even in the cheapest of sales!Both are horribly 3rd party  DRM'd games. And at least parts of this custumor punishing crap is still in both. Annoying, uncomfortable online registration and limited numbers of installations. If you get an unDRM'd version elsewhere... you know, where to gog,  both are quite nice (almost)Open World RPGs. ONLY then, without DRM, is it a big thumbs up for both Two World games from me. I liked 1 even more then 2.Such a shame that a greedy control freaky publisher killed these game off with it.			",322,70,10,63,50,3,32

												Atmospheric Action RPG.  Open world exploration, really crisp and detailed graphics on a mid level gaming rig at high settings.  Hand to hand combat is solid.  Magic is really fun, based on a card system, mix and match to create lots of different variations on spells.  Good crafting system to upgrade your equipments to higher levels and add augmentations, all are meaningfull in battle.  Plenty of quests, many interesting.  Big game with lots to do and explore, easy to get lost in.  Story is fairly generic but it works, gives you a reason to explore the vibrant world, but the exploration is what keeps you coming back.

												With its huge open world, interesting combat system and tons of main and side quests, this game is a big recommendation. It's similar to Skyrim in some segments but it kept it's own spirit and interesting story. With expansion pack you're in it for more than a hundred hours of content. Not to mention amazing graphics considering this was not a project as big or expensive as Skyrim. Music is also very pleasant and it ads to the atmosphere. I want that soundtrack in CD quality. So, all in all, if you can buy this game, buy it. If you like old school RPGs, buy it. If you're not some lazy, spoiled kid, used to have everything pinpointed to you like in today's World of Warcfraft, buy it. Graphics:  ★★★★☆ Sound:  ★★★☆☆ Gameplay:  ★★★★☆ Music:  ★★★★★   Overall:  ★★★★☆ ",653,222,20,98,70,4,151

												Don't let my time played fool you, I played the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this on the Xbox. I would get into all the cool mechanics, the odd sense of humor, the vast amount of content, the crafting system, and the frankly insane magic system. But to be honest, I'm really just here to get something off my chest.For all of the game's vast scale, beautiful landscapes, absolute freedom, and good mechanics, I'm afraid despite all the time I sunk into it it never really stuck with me. The world never felt alive or like anything I was doing had impact on anything else. In short it constantly felt like I was in a game interacting with npc's, a horrific sense of disconnect that kept me from caring about anything that happened in it. It has almost a lonely feeling to it. In that sense I think it shares a ton with games like Sacred 2, where it feels like quality was sacrificed for quantity. Though, this game is WAYYYY better than Sacred 2 XD (Talk about a waste of time!) This lifeless world was really the Achilles heel that kept a good game from being a great one!Morrowind has its incredible world that draws you in with a unique setting and music, Skyrim has some damn fine side questing and full voice acting, not to mention some incredible lore to get sucked into, and TW2.... well, doesn't really have any of that. :/That is not to say that it's a bad game, as I said, mechanically it's a solid RPG. But if you're looking for immersion or a living breathing world, you would probably be better off buying something else. I really want to love this game because I like lesser known studios being successful, but honestly I found my time in the world only moderately entertaining. In the end, I think my sentiments mirror Angry Joe's, if you're a HUGE RPG fan who is waiting for the next big RPG and haven't checked out TW2, you should! It does a lot of things very uniquely and has its own personal style which is worth experiencing. Unique mechanics and a quirky, slightly self aware humor are just enough to keep you soldiering on. Just don't expect to feel very engaged, maybe listen to a podcast or chat over discord while you play. XD7/10 - Unique, a definite recommendation RPG fans burnt out on Skyrim/Witcher. Flawed, has a hard time making its setting engaging. Get it when it goes on sale.EDIT: One thing I forgot to mention, and why I went back to review this game in the first place, is that shockingly an update is coming out for the game soon. It makes absolutely no sense, but there was an announcement of a sequel and another upcoming DLC to coincide with an engine overhaul. I think it's pretty amazing they're still updating this game! Kudos to the developers for being so dedicated, it certainly has me very curious at to what the DLC could be! So if you do buy the game, bear in mind that apparently there will be an overhaul in quarter 2 of 2016... which is really close.			",105,22,1,19,9,0,10

												This game takes some♥♥♥♥♥♥for being... mediocre which it is. Thats not to say its not fun.-Visually its falling behind the times. Although the world and such still look pretty good characters and animations are well dated.-Melee combat and most combat in this game is.... really like a sloppy supporting feature to allow the player to move through the world and story. (Ill get to magic l8er)All in all the biggest issue with this game are where it sits now. As of the time Im making this review most if not all of its concepts are outdated. Unfortunately this was never a game to define an era so unless you liked it when it came out its not gonna have much for you 'now'.+Magic. This is one of the few/only games that actually allows you to collect MANY spells and veriations that you can actually just combine almost freely. Tipecal to RPGs you need to lvl up for more effects and 'card slots'. The whole magic system is based off a card slot type system. Its not that complex but explaining it is.+The world. Oh man... I mean it may lack the content levels we have been spoiled with in modern gaming but its still big and beautiful. You visit multiple locations and explore a varied degree of mysteries.Look, Im not gonna butter this one up for you but if you looking for a decent RPG worth some hours of cheep fun., this may just be the game for you.As always I suggest getting any game on sale, I stress that here as well. Its a good game but unless your jonesing for this game specificly best to snag it at a discount.7.5/10Watch some gameplay. If you like what you see then have some fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Honestly, this is one of the most fun open world RPG's I have EVER played. There is a ton of attention to detail. All the game mechanics are very very well polished, (I especially like the lock picking mechanic, it was a very refreshing take on it because most RPG's use very similar styles of lock picking) and there are so many interesting things you can do, you can learn to play a whole variety of instruments as well as finding and learning new songs. And of course there are the typical classes of any fantasy RPG, rouge, warrior, mage, etc. etc. but all of the skills and tree's are unique enough it feels totally new and innovative. The fighting is very enjoyable and can be actually challenging, instead of spam clicking the left mouse button over and over and over. The story is very intriguing, but I spend a lot of time doing side quests and the like because they are just as deep and interesting and fun!Overall			",97,9,5,12,12,2,7

												This game is quirky to say the least. The sequel to the worst voice acting ever returns and it does up its game. It's no Skyrim or any other Triple A RPG so we shouldn't be making those comparisons, it is however, something to fill the void. It's combat system is dire and the horse riding taking alot of effort. Clunky feature throughout and it's showing it's age. So why the thumbs up? It's still charming enough to sink (no UK hardcopy pun intended) hours into despite its design issues and age. You will have fun here and that's what makes this worth a play through so long as you're finished with every other mainstream RPG first. Enjoy folks.			",36,3,0,1,0,0,1

												I've always loved this game. I've played it several times straight thorough and have never understood the mixed reviews. It's got a big open world, lots of things to do, decent melee combat and awesome ranged combat. Never played a mage but I hear that's decent. Lockpicking minigame is fun. Horse riding is just par for the course.It looks graphically awesome even by today's standards, and despite so many people hating on the main character's VO I think he's hilariously indifferent in conversation. Like he's done this ♥♥♥♥ before and is now totally jaded.The DLC was fairly good, but the main character voice actor swap killed it a bit for me.Definitely recommended.			",224,33,4,15,8,4,5

												I couldn't get even 15 minutes into the game. From clunky Dialogue to poor controls, this game has it all! The voice acting is plain awful, and isn't helped in the lines they have is just as bad. The graphics are horrible, the hair's alpha layer is messed up and looks like they have a drier sheet in their hair. The framerate can be anywhere from 60 to 10 in the blink of an eye. The controls are horrible and unresponsive at best. The combat does not feel rewarding in the slightest, you hold left mouse and you win; your attacks cancel the enemies attack animation, and you attacks cannot be staggered. The game has DRM as far as the eye can see, you have to enter several serial codes, give away your addrss, your email, your name, your computer specs to allow them to detect if it's on a different device, which will trigger the DRM if you so much as upgrade your ram or hard drive.

												TLDR; Great even with problems. Ignore the reg. form. Buy on sale.I find myself greatly enjoying this deeply flawed gem. While it's packed with errors like an erratic camera, clipping graphics, poor controls, randomly non-functional controls, poor iventory management, hilarious character movements, subtitles that don't match the dialogue, dialogue that radomly skips or plays on top of itself, and armor attachments that can only be purchased before you ever gain the right armor but never after.... uh, wow. Serious problems aside, it's really fun. The story is actually quite good, the side quests are fleshed out and entertaining with full characters and goals (like performing a recall on cused man-eating umbrellas). The game doesn't make a joke of itself, it's quite serious, but not without a healthy sense of humor. Character progression is an earnest thing, there are three major classes with different attribute requirements and a host of different skills to populate your skill bar. Melee fighting actually feels rewarding, though it can be frustrating and repetitive. Even so, enemies can have any number of resistances that will keep you switching weapons (and there is a handy hot-key for that) or changing up your gems to get the right bonus (and there are SO F****** many of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!). Archery isn't a joke! You get various skill-shots and other benefits, even a few melee treats for those that just cant put down their bow. The role of the mage in this game is better than most RPGs today, magic is craftable and dynamic. You make your own spells and determine the mana cost, the casting time, the power, range, speed, attack/defense, buff/debuff, area, how long it lasts, how many it targets. I mean, WHAT?! Really?! And the voice acting! Ah, what .... totally passable voice acting. Seriously, if you want bad voice acting play the first one in the series(hint: its awful). This one though? Not bad. Lets talk about the world: It's big. It's also dosed out like perscription drugs, so not TOTALLY open world. Chapter one nets you an huge explorable island and tiny home base island. Once you begin, all that space is open. Doesn't matter what's in it, who defends it, none of that. You wanna go? Go. Chapter 2 nets you another island.I'm 20 hours in and I just started Chapter 2. There is so much content in this beast, seriously, so much.So yes, it has .... ehm, serious problems... like, a lot. But it's a huge, thriving gritty RPG that really is an RPG, not just an action/adventure game wearing a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mask. This game is on sale all the damn time, just pick it up for like 2 or 3 bucks and profit for days. Hell, I'd probably even buy it full price.As for all cry-babies going on about DRM tracking and the registration process, IT'S ♥♥♥♥ING OPTIONAL YOU STUPID♥♥♥♥♥♥GIBBONS. I'm 20hrs in and I haven't filled out any forms, no one has asked for any information, no code was emailed to me to track my gameplay. Am I seriously the only one that remembers playing Diablo II or Icewind Dale? They asked you to register too; they asked for addresses, phone numbers, the whole nine yards. All you have to do is click the little box that says ""PLEASE GO ♥♥♥♥ YOURSELF"" instead of ""YES, I'M A MORON AND YOU CAN HAVE ALL MY INFORMATION""What a novel concept.			",101,7,3,20,3,0,11

												  This was a pretty good game that could have been much better. Be sure to save allot because it crashes often because maybe I was  going to fast with the controller. No keyboard  options unless you are entering codes. Had to go back one time and lost about 5 hours of game play because of a glich in the sequence of tasks where I ran into a loop that I could not find a way around to move forward in the game. Another time while doing a task in the swamp ran into some creatures that were part of a task which I did not have yet, then when I did, I could not do them because I had alread killed them and the tasks did not reset itself or would still be showing on my map .  Also, one thing about the free roaming aspect is, if you wander off too far from where the game thinks you should be it will send you back, even if you found a way to get their using your aquired abilites. Made it to the last boss fight and for me it was so hard to beat it using a 360 controller and gave up tring to finish it for now. Hint, fire protection a must. Maybe I will go back to before the point of no return and just play around, because, I was having fun before I did. Realy enjoyed using my sail boat for some reason and hoping to play the pirate DLC some time in the future. Check my profile info for my system spec's to compair with yours, I played it at 1080P with the settings maxed out.I would recommend this game if your into these types of games for the story line even thou technicly I have not completely finished the game, but maybe you will.

Second memory was that I could not find the place I was supposed to go for a quest . ( it was obvious )You can either upgrade your archer , wizard or warrior skils . So why not upgrade some of the 3 of them , in this case fighting is harder . Cars that contain spells , combined different result . Like summoning some creatures . Lockpicking . Every single stupid chest is locked . Is kinda easy to unlock but is you mess up and no keys left , no more chest opening for you .			",149,29,17,13,4,0,9

												37 hrs into this game I have mixed feelings but still recommend it.The BadThe combat system is klunky and at times difficult.  With little tutorial it takes many hours to get the hang of it and how to arrange your equipment for quick gear change to adapt to fights.With no system to identify levels of quests or monters its easy to waste time going somewhere only to have creatures beat you down in one hit.The dialog system is lacking. The main character has a preset personality and preset conversations thus giving nocontrol over him aggrivating people.Game instructions/help is lacking. Had to look up online simple things that aren't explained.Horses stay where you left them so you end up choosing between using horses or portals.The GoodThe storyline is thought out and in depth.  Quests are even well flushed out and can be surprising. A lot of thought went into quests and making sure there is a variety of things I hadn't come across in other RPGs.The skill system is unique and allows you to be 4 classes at once so you have utility for any situation.Travel is easy. Walking doesn't take long but there are also portals and horses to speed things up. The world doesn't feel as open as the original game but its still very large and alot of leeway given once you get past the first few quests.			",28,5,0,15,4,2,7

												Heck yes I recommend this game. I actually believe that I would still be happy if I payed the full 20 dollars for Two worlds 2.So let's hear the primary complainsDRMUncheck the box, type in the code once. Done. No problem, no hassleVoice actingThe one thing I really love about this game is that every voice actor is different (or almost all). It's like I'm really in a living breathing world as everyone sounds unique. In the real world, not everyone is a great orator either. Some people are shy, some people mumble, some people are annoying, some people are goofy, some are awkward, some are confident. This game captures all of this aspect.Unlike skyrim and oblivion where every NPC has a golden radio voice, with imperfection lies a certain charm that can't be seen in other games. StoryI didn't finish the story yet, but it's not bad. Open world games aren't really known for great stories anyways.Side questsEvery side quest is unique, and there is an abundance of it. They do go in depth and there are special areas allocated just for the quests instead of plain backtracking. CombatOkay, there is actually a problem here. The swordfighting is clunky. You have to not press any directional button to initiate combos and sometimes the hitboxes are way off. That is a genuine flaw.Archery is wack. It doesn't feel satisfying and the hits of the arrow seem shallow.However, the magic spell crafting portion of the game is amazing. 4000 combinations of spells and great varying effects of each unique permutations make magic combat great. The others not so muchThere you have it. If you see it on a sale I would definitely recommend a try since it dips below $5 (and often 3$)			",107,52,0,15,5,0,20

												Looks nice; combat system is ok IMO. Did not have to re-re-re-re-enter the serial in the 40 minutes I played it. And it crashes in the graveyard part of the tutorial every frigging time, so I can't continue the game. What a bunch of crap.			",238,80,3,41,39,3,30

												I had this for the Xbox and it was brilliant but it seems that ever since I got it for the PC it's became the most ridiculous game ever! Do not buy this because It is not worth the money or the time of day. I had so many problems getting this game to launch after having to download it twice for no reason. After it did launch I entered my CD key but then HAD TO ENTER PRIVATE INFORMATION LIKE MY HOME ADDRESS, WTF DEVS?  to make matters worse every ♥♥♥♥ing time I launch the game I need to manually enter the CD key and all of my ♥♥♥♥ing personal info again.If you think this game looks good, yes it does but DON'T buy this piece of trash, that's the last time I buy anything from these devs!

												Well, I really don't understand the hate about this game.The outdated Topware registration is not mandatory as long as you enter your registration key before your first play.It's a very decent game with very good visuals for its time, an interesting story, crafing and magic system.Two Worlds 2 is a hidden gem, like Divinity 2 The Dragon Knight Saga.By the way they are similiar in several points.Pros:- good visuals and overall stability (seriously, how can players have problems with the engine? I don't get it...) - crafting system- magic system- skills system - large open world with many interest points, caves and mobs to kill- decent story- good musicsCons:- voice acting (oh god... It's this kind of voice acting that is unintentionally hilarious)- melee combat system (not interesting) ",203,40,3,63,9,2,17

												Oh god I don't know where to start.I'm a huge fan of the first game, I loved it to death. And played it to death.Firstly I ignored all the reviews for this game cause I thought i'd form my own opinion on it.It took me almost an hour to actually get the game able to run because of all these stupid Activation codes you needed to activate.It starts off really slow, and it continues really slow.It has a really clunky interface in my opinion, the combat system is okay, not the best and not the worst.Please do not buy this game unless it's gifted to you.Even if it's gifted to you. Please refund it for the person who purchased it for you. ",185,22,5,24,16,0,8

												Honestly, it's something to do when you and your friend(s) just want to run around and kick wolves and undead things. The gameplay is repetitive, and the combat is entirely one-dimensional. If you wanted to feel special about yourself, I guess you can say that at least it was barely better than the first Two Worlds.

												First of all: the game didn't work when I first launched it. I had to reinstall Nvidia PhysX to make it work. In this game, you can only play a caucasian male, with tiny, tiny hands. The cutscenes are sluggish and unimportant, the dialogue is sumb and the voice acting is just the worst!If you, like me, were looking for a open world action RPG to scratch that Skyrim itch: do not get this game. Not even for the couple of euros it costs. it will just leave you frustrated.			",128,31,1,12,12,2,11

												2W2 is a very highly underated game.It's 5 years old and you would considder it too old for you to pay attention to it. But believe me when i'm telling you, that it's worth playing. It's not Skyrim, it's not Witcher, it's not whatever game you will compare it to.With that said, i have to point out, that the game mechanics are something you have to get used to. But after a while you figure it out.Look at the graphics, just look at the screenshots, and watch the trailers too. then forget about the age of the game.Now you feel the urge to play this game, am i right ?Good !!!If it's on sale, then get it. Hell if it's not on sale, then get it too. Actually buy it right now !Verdict : this game should be part of any rpg's fan's game library.			",427,94,10,63,23,5,40

												Not to bad for an older Game. Voice overs are a bit lame and you have to pay attention to them to gain insight on what to do next. The game at times doesn't give you the ability to see it in ""notes/journal"" or go back and have the dialog repeated again. Caught me a couple of times where i had to go find a Walkthrough for the game on-line to get a clue. A couple of annoying glithces, but for the little money I spent on it it's been worth it so far.Update:Now that I progressed to the ridiculous boss scene with the dragon possessed queen I have to take back my recommendation. The boss scene is rigged against you. For just about every third strike you have to guzzle a health vial and the control responses change from what you have grown very accustomed to so as to further aggravate the frustration (heavily lagged response to control commands). It angered me enough to ditch this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I recommend this with caveats. I think I got this on sale for less than $2, IIRC. That being said, I wouldn't pay full price for it. It's fun for a little while though. It's better than the Gothic series, imo.I usually make melee characters in games like this, but the melee combat is terrible here. The magic system is actually good though, so play a mage if you get this game. Archers are pretty cool too. Melee though... terrible... You've been warned. Also, horse riding is pretty terrible.Artificial difficulty spikes are pretty lame in this game, making you go grind out some levels before proceeding to a new area, so you don't get one-shotted. That's ultimately why I quit playing. The story was actually pretty good, but not good enough to keep me playing.TL;DR If you like playing mages and can get this game on sale, then go for it. You'll get your $2 worth.			",91,19,0,32,7,0,7

												This game realy is very underrated, which is a tragedy because if this company got more love they could make some pretty amazing games. The voice-acting is average but combat is really good; However, it can be clunky. You have to give yourself time to acclimate to its style. Once you do, it's very rewarding. It has better combat than Skyrim imo.  It's closer to Witcher 2 style combat imo. Graphics are also quite good. I can't run it on max settings.			",495,134,4,103,20,1,52

												Two Worlds II is only 5 bucks right now, and it's ♥♥♥♥ing worth it. I'm letting you all know, 3 days before the end of the sale.The story is decent, the voice acting works, it gets a bad rep for being a little different. Also, the AI is hilarious. Sometimes enemies brutally murder you, other times they are completely helpless. It's random and fun.The graphics are fantastic, the combat system is unique, often difficult to master, but very rewarding. There are no ""classes"". You just level up and choose where to put your points. You can spec in one type of combat, and you should, but that being said, mages can assasinate using stealth attacks and warriors can summon demons to fight with them. Rangers can snipe and shoot multiple arrows at the same time (and actually aim them at different targets), and the lockpicking system rocks. Mages MAKE THEIR OWN ♥♥♥♥ING SPELLS. Oh and the alchemy rivals that of the witcher and TES.It's open world, multiplayer (in an entirely different RTS game mode which is sweet), the graphics are gorgeous, the combat system shines, the loot system rocks, you can use a demon eye to float around and scout ahead of you.Did I mention you can be an actual Bard?? As in, you buy an instrument, and then sheet music, and you get to actually play it. Each instrument has a different style, which you play in a guitar hero like fashion. You can play the drums, the harp, the violin, the flute, and the guitar. The drums are the easiest, and the guitar is the hardest. If you play in crowds, you will actually gain money from the people, depending on your score. Being a bard is so awesome I've literally paused my questing and done nothing else but play, just to try and master it since the moment I discovered it.Seriously, you are going to want to give this B-sider a shot.Just beware, it's really hard. I play on Easy and it's still a challenge.			",186,64,4,30,32,3,30

												I really want to like this game more than I do. So many good ideas, so much effort, this game has HUGE potential to be something great. But no, for every good thing this game has going for it, there's equally big hunk of cheesy execution or strange desing choise to scale that down. After around 150 hours of playtime in Xbox version, I wanted to see if there's any difference in PC version. Though PC version is indeed superior, console version and PC version shares same strange desing of ""Press 2 specific keys to do everything ever"". For example; Mouse 2 is your sneak, sprint, defence, map- and enemy marking, and space acts as jump, use, loot, speak, interact, start event (lockpicking, playing an instrument) and backstep/dodge. Some of these doesn't work well together at all. When you try to raise defence in combat, make sure you're in complete stand still, or you'll end up running all around the place like Usain Bolt with his♥♥♥♥♥lit on fire.However, Two Worlds 2 is not bad game. Not at all. If you get through the confusing intro and get used to its controls, you're in for time consuming adventure loot-a-thon in a rather beaytiful, well made world. Yet still this is a far from actually good game. Like I early stated, for every potentially good thing this game has, there's somekind of bad decision in desing or execution.  I see the reviews of Two Worlds 2 are rather neutral, whitch suits this game extremely well. My overall opinion of TW2 is ""Neutral"". It's not bad or good game, it's ""neutral"". You won't lose anything trying this game out, nor there is any special reason to play it; it's ""neutral"" experience.The prize might be this games' biggest minus side. TW2 can offer you hours upon hours of exploring, but it reguires so much getting used to, that 20 euros for this might be just a little too much. Shall you get it for near 10 euros, do consider trying it out. ""You just might find yourself a friend from most unexpected of places""			",72,9,0,10,7,1,0

												You need to spend time in theis game to actually enjoy what it has to offer. (And I have spent a ton)In my opinion Two Worlds Two is incredibly immersive and beautiful. The flow reminds me of the origional final fantasy, where the world itself is cereberal and if you think you can do something then you probably can.I have put a lot of time into this game and recently lost my save. Losing my save gives me another chance to start it all over again and dive back into a fun game.			",97,12,5,14,11,0,7

												Four words- great, clever and fun. Forget the mixed reviews, this game is great and a gem. Old school and at the same time new and fresh.A million times better than the first game in every aspect, was decent but plagued with issues and pixel like faces.This game has great graphics, there is still a few issues with combat thou but is much better and smoother and odd bit of lag and a bit of roughness but runs smoothly and no slow down or drops.My main advice is to turn off the EAX Eniviroment on the settings section in game is pointless and causes some crashes issues on computer, game runs like super smooth and no crashes also you need to have a grapics card with PhysX since their is an option in game to use it runs much better and handles very well also turning off auto save helps alot. Also is a consule command the developers made to fix the camera issues in the single player mode google it but do it in the beggining of the game of a new game and save is best some peole have had issues but only do this cheat no other ones since it will bug up your game and have to unistall and download again.The spells skills and weapons, crafting are much better and user interface is nice touch, enemies are better and more varied, the areas are better if a little repetitive in some areas, the story is interesting and a lot of humour, dark moments, there is tons of stuff you can do in the game is at least 80+, 100+ hours including side quests , missions and activitys and also get the dlc pirate one adds something different to the mix and new stuff and content.You can play dice, double cross, steal, join stuff, and so many other actvitys you can do don't want to spoil them but some you cannot do in the witcher 3 and are different and has a touch of fable about it. You can hold two weapons like a bad♥♥♥♥♥and cut down enemies with death moves and the horse riding is much better, archery is better. This game is well optimised and supports most computers runs well on low end thou need to set some settings set lower but does not effect the experience at all. Note works best on windows 7/ 8- if you use windows 10 might have some issues which can be addressed by looking up on internet or youtube.Witcher 3 is a great game but needs a high end computer to handle it, this is the cheaper alternative to it but just not quite as good, witcher 3 is legend.Also after christmas 2017 they are updating the engine and tweaking some stuff and the combat also two new dlc expansions which will be great. The game came out in 2011 so is still getting some major updates. They have anounced a third two worlds game as well, fingers crossed it will be cool and not cancelled.My verdictGraphics 8.0Interface and inventory 8.0Story 8.5Game play- Combat 8.0 Spells 10/10  stuff to do 10/10 replay value 9.0overall 8.3/ 10Highly recommend especially in a sale, got it today for about 2 pounds with the pirate dlc you are getting a great value also dont need an account for single player only if you are playing online, playing this on single player, still learning new stuff and places have not even touched the surface yet.Great thumbs up.

Posted: December 10, 2014
												Warning: Extremely long, mixed rant and story ahead. It doesn't show, but I've spent dozens of hours in this thing, I swear. I bought this... thing because Angry Joe recommended it to people who love really, really open world games. As a fan of Garry's Mod, Skyrim's WORLD (not the combat) and free-wheeling, massive games like Wind Waker or Mass Effect, I thought this might be up my alley. I'm not ""terribly"" pretentious when it comes to graphics, and I like European games. I thought ""Hell, why not."" Bought it at full price. With the DLC. I had no idea what I was in for. Joe, I love you man, but your tastes and mine are not the same. But first, the good. The World: You can pick a direction or a distant mountain or tower, and walk there. I love that in any game. But there appears to be three huge continents on the map: THIS IS A LIE. There is ONE continent, ONE small island, and ONE SWAMP. THE THIRD CONTINENT IS A LIE. Also, if you like generic Asian land, Savanah Land, and Swamp Land, then this game is totally for you. The graphics: The environmental graphics, while often repetitive, can almost be breath-taking at times. At full graphics I'm sure it's quite nice looking, especially the ambient lighting and textures. I particularly like the undead swamp, abandoned Asian town, wasteland, and initial savannah area. That being said, the character models are quite atrocious. While they weren't exactly repulsive, they were very, very ugly, in a charming sort of way, and suffered from an armor designer with tastes very similar to the horrifically awful taste in the Dragon Age games. Seriously, Bioware, shoot that desginer. Anyway, another somewhat bright spot in the awfulness is the spell design system. I love anything which allows you to summon creatures, and worked like hell to get where I could summon a massive army of skeletons to do my evil bidding, wiping out whole villages of hyena-men in a massive melee beneath a piercing bright moon on the blood-soaked savana. That totally kicked♥♥♥♥♥ as well as wiping out outposts with hordes of rock golems, or my undead horde murdering fishmen in some idiot's flooded basement. There were some quite memorable side missions, the most well-done the very early on ""Fluffy the Dog"" mission. That was a quite excellently executed buildup and execution of a damn creepy horror level. Playing at 3am with headphones to hear that soundtrack in the final room (you'll know it) was truly nightmare fuel. Also that bit where the the guy was being buried alive, and the undead swamp, had really quite nice, stark imagery and fairly well realized concepts. I really quite liked those parts, when it was being marred by...The bad: And how much bad there is. First the writing: It is quite, quite awful. The side characters (and there are too many of them) are, for the vast majority, flat, lifeless constructs who dole out missions. I can remember a few of them mostly a corrupt embalmer, the grave digging guy, and the creepy priest. And some of the more major characters, the gay captain, the witch, the demon priest, the one British guy (?), the orc chick (Bioware relationship it most certainly was NOT) and of course the Big Bad himself. I actually was genuinely interested in his backstory, and to see how he and the main character were really very similar: both ruthless sons-a-♥♥♥♥♥es, who just happened to go down different paths. Definitely not a novel concept, or particularly well executed but I liked it anyway. Further comparing it to Bioware and Skyrim, I appreciate that everything was fully animated and voice acted. Not many games has the cajones to do that. However, that being said, the extremely annoying protagonist caused me to remember why silent protagonists aren't so bad after all: he never shuts his god-damn mouth. He dispenses a tiny pool of one liners upon dispatching his feeble enemies which RAPIDLY grate on the nerves during extended play sessions. That, and all the voice acting there is is EXCESSIVELY awful voice acting. Seriously. It is very very bad. But, in a morbidly enjoyable sort of way, I guess. You can always skip it if it really starts to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off (which it may). The other truly terrible bit of the story is the cutscenes: Every one of them is overly elaborate, horribley mo-capped, butchering-the-art-of-cinema awful. Seriously. These guys need to learn about a little thing called subtlty. And speaking of subtlty, the ending twist may just be the worst thing ever. Yeah, both of them. They just plain suck. Now to break down the meat of the game:      There is only one good class. Forget about the complicated spell casting system, because this is how EVERY, and I mean EVERY battle works. Summon deads. Deads distract enemy/form human wall. Throw the same basic spell 500000 times because it is the only thing that recharges fast enough until the deads vanish. Resummon. Repeat until target dead. Repeat ad nauseum with every single fight, and by that I mean the 1000s of enemies you will face in the course of this game. Utter lack of damage resistance means attacks from tough enemies often kill you instantly.      Archery is broken and horrible so rangers are stupid and don't exist.      Horse combat is utterly non-existant. I get that we can't all be Mount and Blade, but horses are worse that useless.      Only fighters have enough damage resistance to be worth playing, but their fighting is possibly even more boring. Spam attacks, wait for idiotic MMO cooldowns, and slavage armor so thick that enemy attacks don't even graze you. PvE is totally unbalanced. If an enemy succeeds in wounding you, pause time, make 5000 health potions, then drink them. The stats system utterly lacks subtelty. Put all your points in health and strength. There is absolutely no point to multi-classing. Dark Souls this AIN'T. Horrible boring enemies that make JRPG's slimes and bats look clever. Ooh, my club and I are SO scared of skeletons. I truly hate when ostriches, hyenas, boars, and rhinos, all of whom should hate each other, gang up to kill you. It's lazy. And you may have heard of the final boss battle on a forum. It is one of the most truly pahtetic, disgusting and spectacular fails of a fight I have ever seen in gaming history. I don't mean that lightly. All in all, it's frustrating, it's idiotic, it's droll, and it's very boring at times. But there are many points where I had fun. So I'm sorry, Two Worlds 2. I simply can't recommend you to the world. I can only say to those would be buyers out there: if summoning a horde of skeletons to kill a herd of rhinos sounds awesome, or an extremely clumsy approach to sexual assualt (shudder) is your cup of tea, or you LOOOOOVE horrible MMO combat: By all means. Play this... thing. It's your funeral.			",95,13,0,9,3,0,14

												No.... please no. Buy this game on sale as a last resort if you have earned every achievement in every other action/adventure/rpg that ever existed. Game has some interesting mechanics, such as the magic system, but the combat is soooo bad. And the animations.... *shiver*. Please, for the love of good games, go buy Skyrim, Oblivion, Dark Souls, or Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning if you are looking for a great action/adventure rpg with character creation. This game is rubbish. I've tried coming back to it a few times and simply cant get past the horrible combat. Maybe if you get it as part of a humble bundle that has some other game you are interested in. ",173,31,2,40,18,3,25

												I have to recommend this game, you can build your own spells and combat is dependant on your equipment and such.  You can dual wield, wield a shield, a two hander, a ranged weapon, or mage stuff.  So it has some custimization.   Let's see sort of open world, nice towns, dark sounding character voice.  Good game but it has flaws.  Some quests funny. Near the final mission where you go to final mission area difficulty goes up, sometimes dungeons are for a level much higher than your current level and that is annoying at first, cutscenes glitch a lot and I was forced to watch them on youtube.  warning do orc side missions before ending, and it glitches at times and other times it reminds me of setting foot in higher level area than I should be in an mmo.  Combat does have annoying block mechanic.But I want to see how this continues.  Oh, and you can build a village from nothing and it does look pretty.			",29,6,0,28,10,0,23

												Amazing improvement since the first two worlds. I recommend to play as a MAGE. Custom spells in this game are amazing. Some examples1 - One spell who can spawn 6 golems and other to spawn 6 death knight, both in lv 40 with 100% bonus on health and damage ( missile + spray in first slot + 10 summon & 10 stone/decay in sec slot) 2 - A spell that fire 7 homing magical missiles each one dealing 2300 shock damage and can steal 500 pts of enemy health to my mage3 - A tornado who can put even a ship in air4 - A spell to be invisible ( Air + Enchant + Time ) 5 - A spell who allow my character to resurrect.Life  + Enchant  + Damage  + Time + Protection   6 - A spell to return damage to enemy(can return more than 300% (Power + Enchant + Damage + Time ) This in 20 hours of gameplay. Amazing. Purchased with discount, but worth the full price. I hope that in next two worlds, they put a OPTIONAL first person and a non annoying DMR. Will be perfect			",133,8,1,33,1,0,1

												Well, after Two Worlds 1 my hopes were up. I should have known better.(note: updated 02-Jun-2016 after spending far too many hours playing it to the end)Two Worlds 2 on PC is worse in every way.  I'm barely to level 6 and I'm already annoyed as hell with this game.  When I got to level 40 or so, I was truly p i s s e d off at this game. Sheer bloody-mindedness kept me going, except for the ending. More on that later. On the plus side, the game lets you keep playing after the ending. I like that in a game.If you think that reviews should only be sweetness and light, stop reading here. It gets ugly.To start with, the graphics. Even on max resolution, it has the feel of a game stuck on 640x800. Limited view, huge character in the middle of the screen, everything that's wrong with a low-resolution view but at 2560x1440. Even fiddling with the FOV doesn't really help.Then there's the inventory tracking. TW1 let you put things where you wanted them. TW2 doesn't even pretend to care. No matter resolution (see above), the inventory screen takes up most of your screen. And instead of fitting more onto the screen, they just increased the size of the items. So you end up multiple pages of stuff you cannot sort to suit yourself, that you have to page through to find what it was they just plopped into the inventory.Crafting? Don't make me laugh. You can ""upgrade"" equipment, except you can't upgrade it very much to start, and by the time you have the level required to upgrade it to something nice, you find stuff that's better than what you can upgrade it to anyway. Then there's the material requirements. Each item drops 1, sometimes 2 of a material. However, to upgrade the full 20 levels, you'll need hundreds of material items. Which you cannot buy in bulk, you have to laboriously dismantle equipment, one at a time. And you'll never find enough of certain materials, and you can't afford to buy them, because by the time you have enough money, you can't find the low-level stuff to buy any more, even though it yields exactly the same ""1 material"" as the much more expensive stuff. Useless.Alchemy? Not bad, but really not useful. That is, even if you can find the ingredients in your pack once you have them. Sadly, there doesn't seem to be any order or reason to how they throw it into the pack. So you spend most of your time mousing over to see what it was you wanted to put together. Even then, alchemy really isn't that useful in the game.Fight mechanics are a wash. Initially you can't do anything, and you'll end up dying a lot.  At least TW1 gave you an option of dodging a lot when facing tough opponents. TW2 - nope, 1 or 2-shot kills is the order the day if you get close to the wrong opponent. Save. Save often. Because you'll be needing it. It's as if they looked at Dark Souls and went ""hey, that's a great mechanic"" without putting any thought into what makes it a great mechanic.  Later in the game you can at least block a good portion of damage. And if you time it you can sprint out of the way of a blow by the larger creatures. The fighting system still sucks though.Then there's the horses. In TW1 they were bad enough, with really poor controls and generally almost not worth it. At least you could ride and look around a little to check out landmarks, etc, so they were mildly useful. In TW2 they decided that ""useful"" wasn't something they wanted, so they took it a step further and made it so you have to constantly pay attention to a particular meter so you keep clicking at the right intervals to keep the horse moving. No clicky, no move. But if you click too much the horse throws you off. They effectively turned it into its own very boring, very long, and very annoying minigame. As for controls, it's almost unmanageable. A single keypress left or right at low speed and the horse does a 180. ""Fine control"" doesn't seem to be in the vocabulary.  As others have said, just up your stamina and sprint everywhere. Probably faster anyway.Then we get to the final boss fight. You've spent the entire game honing skills, creating armour, collecting potions - ALL OF WHICH will be completely and utterly useless in the final boss fight. They turned it into a duck-hunt game where the duck gets to shoot back. Really. Except the duck is a dragon, but that's the only difference. Your fire resistance? Doesn't work. 100% fire resistance? Doesn't count, you take exactly the same amount of damage as if you didn't have any. That in addition to clunkly controls (on the PC) make the final boss fight one of the most aggravating examples of shoddy work I've every seen, INCLUDING the boss fights in the pre-fix version of Deus Ex Human Revolution.One of the most disappointing sequels I've seen in years. Avoid this game at all costs!			",119,13,0,29,5,0,6

												So my first impressions of this game are pretty good so far. It's a vast improvement over the 1st in both gameplay and acting but even then the combat is fairly easy to grasp but tricky to to actually do when fighting more than one enemy. It's been set in a beautiful world however filled with different types of enemies and some side quests to keep you entertained should you decide to do them. I enjoy watching the clips which are well animated and sword fight early on in the game between an Orc and armour clad Knight was pretty entertaining to watch thanks to the way it was animated.VOICE ACTINGThe voice acting is good in some places and not so good in others with the main character neither being the best or worst of the lot but in the long run he talks in a grumpy whisper ALL the time with little or no emotion shown in his lines and, truth be told, listening to him speak caused me to turn on subtitles and skip the dialogue.Which leads me to my next issue. The Subtitles are poorly written, whether or not this was done in some kind of translation or just by sheer lack of proofreading what is actually said is sometimes a little different to whats written. This wouldn't be a problem if not for the grammer and placement issues I noticed so even though the actors make perfect sense the subtitles sometimes don't.GAME WORLDRPG's like this need a strong world to back it up, one that looks good and encourages me to explore and yes it is absolutely beautiful and the enemies in it are often well animated and nice to look at (all except the Groms which annoy me) but I felt no drive to go exploring too far off the road for fear of the extremely tough enemies that randomly plague the wilderness. This game has no leveled zones and, unlike Skyrim on consoles, the world does not level with you. At level 2 you could fight something very capable fo turning you into mince in less than ten seconds so choose your battles wisely. The first town you start in is located in the Sahvanna which is nice and has some enemies often not seen in RPG's like Baboons, Rhinos and other such enemies.COMBATCombat is easy to pick up. You learn it step by step in the tutorial sections so if you cant block from the get go, worry not because you still need to learn how. Melee comes first then Archery and finally Magic which people (including me) say is a strong point in the game thanks to the customizable spells. Archery and Magic are all auto aim but Melee is a different story, You need to think tactically to some degree though most enemies are a hack and slash affair.What surprised me was the stealth system of the game. You can sneak up behind enemies and stab them in the back with a pretty simplistic animation but this only works on humanoids so far as I know. Though I did notice a fair amount of enemies seem to be have their backs turned in the worst places such as beside a cliff. Why would you be staring into a wall of rock when your back is so exposed to an assisination from behind. It's alnost like they invite you to get that free kill!SKILLSSo there's a variety of crafting skills from alchemy to blacksmithing which work but its really hard to explain their function. Lockpicking in this game is quite simple but rewarding and the minigame used to pick the locks is both easy but clever.MUSICThis game has a really good soundtrack. The ambience to the scores during cutscenes are great in my opinion and really bring something good to this beautiful world filled with boring people. You can even buy an intrument and some song sheets though I never got to see if you could play them or not as I wasn't wasting money on it.As I play through the game I plan on adding more to my review.

												Right when I started the game, they promptly demanded my address, phone number, email, first and last name, and my PC specs just to play the full game. This should not be required to play a single player game THAT I ALREADY PAYED FOR. When I denied the game access to my personal information, it launched in ""demo mode"" as a not fully activated product, even after I entered my access code. Even still, I decided to give it a shot and the game itself is very basic. Graphics are decent, gameplay is a bit boring but alright, but I refuse to give you my personal info to play a single player game. 2/10			",44,3,0,10,7,0,2

												The game is bad for many reasons1. The game didn't even open for me, had to install some extra stuff manually from the game folder2. registration process at the beginning of the game, they ask for too much info3. (personal) weird controls, seriously RMB to run is something unheard of4. (personal) the jumping animation is bad, has a small delay and a really crappy jumpHonestly ill still give it a try for a couple for hours, ill rate the game 4/10 not the best open world rpg out there, but there are sales for the game everywhere and might as well pick it up for 1-2 dollars.

												This game was a favorite of mine on xbox 360, the original was One of my favorite games when I was a teen. Think of this game like Oblivion or even morrowind, You dont play it for the graphics anymore... you play it for the story, the nostalgia. It has so much content most newer games can't provide even 1 half of the total game play. and thats not counting multiplayer.The bad reviews people put complaining about the graphics and the animations makes me sad. It would be simular to people dogging on oblivion graphics now. Its an OLD GAME! well not that old but it was good for its time. Its unfair to people who come to check reviews to decide if they want the game or not to see their comments. This game deserves a review from someone who wont compare it to moder games and instead compare it to its own generation of games, its on ""tier"" so to speakwith that said:Artwork and design: 4/5Audio and soundtrack: 4/5Story: 5/5Content: 5/5originality: 5/5""This game brings in a unique aspect known as spell crafting, unlike many games with simular features, this one did it right!""Now for all you modern gamers who wants there childish review:Artwork and design: 4/5Audio and soundtrack: 4/5Story: 5/5Content: 5/5originality: 5/5""thats right same exact review. I never add ""graphics into my reviews and with that exluded, the design of the game is still a great design, the story actually means something and if there is anything that never ""changes"" with time its a ""GOOD STORY"" the music is still its own soooo yeah... cant really give it any worse of a review without personal hatred for it...Still has more content than just about any modern game.... and noone has been able to copy any of this games original content... not properly anyways so its still original. and if anyone copies it ... well its still an original.....

												First and foremost if you plan on playing this game ""Activate"" and ""Register"" are two different things. You must activate the game by internet or phone with your cd-key, but make sure to uncheck the ""register"" box so you won't have to deal with the hassle of filling out a form with all your personal info.I had an issue with this game regarding lag or slowdown where the game would go from running smooth 60fps then lagging heavily then back to smooth. I was able to resolve it by opening Nvidia Control panel and manually setting the profile of this game to run using ""Adaptive V-Sync"", ""Triple Buffering ON"" and ""Single Display Performance"". It still slightly lags in parts of the intro where you escape the prison but overall fixes the major slowdown issues across the game.As for the game itself it has its charms and shortcomings. On the positive side the graphics hold up quite well in 2016 with max settings and environments have detailed design. You can have three active sets of gear so switching between fighting styles is easy. Voice over work is a massive improvement over the original game and feels more polished.On the bad side of things the game relies heavily on combat and it is very clunky and frustating. For example if you melee and move while you press the attack button for combos, it will break the chain. You must stand still for your attacks to chain. Smaller faster enemies will do hit and run tactics where they will charge attack and immediately run away a few yards, making counters useless. Then there are enemies that will swarm you and attack you repeatedly and all you can really do is block and run away. The game also throws in random enemies that are much stronger then the rest. Problem is you can't really tell which ones they are until they hit you twice while you block and kill you. The animations aren't great either. Attacks look like that don't have any impact and your character looks like he is just flailing his arms around. Auto target is extremely unreliable with a high chance you will be dislodged and attack open space.I haven't played too far into the game to get a strong grasp of the story but so far the prologue doesn't really offer anything special. The first bunch of characters that help you on your quest seem decent but the main character is annoying. I don't understand why he is so weak that he has to learn how to use a sword/staff/bow and he just talks way too much.I haven't run into any major glitches (ie. crashing/corrupt saves) but a minor one is during dialog between the characters the lines would get cut off and the next character would begin talking.Overall it's hard to give a definitive yes or no to recommending the game. I would recommend getting the game absolutely if it's on sale. I picked it up for a couple of bucks. It's a fun distraction if you are patient enough and give it a chance. However, if you had just finished games like Skyrim or the Witcher 2/3, you might feel like this game is nothing but mediocre compared to those polished amazing experiences.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The first Two Worlds is arguably an abomination, surely it had a decent sized open world, a huge range of equipment and online to boot, it was executed badly and i really mean badly, it's one of the glitchiest rpg's...no, games of this generation.People were horrified to hear that there was a sequel to this foul game, so much that they thought it was laughable that it even got a sequel in the first place as well as the running joke of ""two worlds two"" but in fact, a sequel was just what this game needed.Although it was supposed to be an expansion to the first two worlds, reality pump and topware clearly saw that the first game wasn't well received and decided to improve upon it rather than adding on to it. As a result they decided to make a sequal...though it does seem to be a remaster of the original two worlds with the main villian of the first game returning in which you clearly beat him (ganondorf much?), that is if you picked the good choice. It's easy to say that this game is a lot more engaging than the first and you can see that they really worked hard on this game. The graphics for starters are pretty good, something you wouldn't expect to see after the abomination that was the first game, you can clearly see an improvement. Unfortunately this can make the game pretty unstable at times with plenty of lag issues (especially if you're playing a mage character).The game opens up in Castle Vahkmaar where you have been taken prisoner by the evil emperor, Gandohar (what a step up eh?) and you have to escape the prison where you end up on this small island and meet a prophet as well as a band of orcs, afterwards you are free to explore the open world...well not exactly everywhere. You unlock new areas as you progress through the main quest which may be off putting to some. One of the games strong points is it's questing. Unlike most wrpg's Questing doesn't always feel like a tedious affair, sure there aren't as many quests as most wrpg's such as elder scrolls but there are a lot less ""filler"" quests, most of the mundane ones being buliten board quests. Quests in Two Worlds 2 feel more interactive than most, though the main game gives you very little options in choice, there are often multiple paths/choices that you can take in side missions and many of them are engaging if only for the bizarre sense of humor in them and their creativity. Some quests may seem plain and simple at first however there are many twists and turns which may take you for surprise or they're just plain funny. Some quests can be pretty mundane but there aren't that many of them, thank god (seriously if you're going to add side quests at least make them interesting).The main story itself is pretty standard fare for most wrpg's, don't expect anything amazing. Two Worlds 2 can catch some players off guard though as it's storyline does have a few twists and they are well explained. put simply, do not play this game for it's plot. The main story does have some interesting moments and scenes however, just don't think about the plot much and enjoy your time in antaloor, pay the story no attention.The game play has improved from the first game and is similar to that of Diablo 3 but far superior (expect something Diablo esque with the game play) every element of game play feels reminiscent to Diablo, heck i even made some spells from the original Diablo in two worlds 2 such as immolation and nova as well as mana shield. Expect a lot of potion drinking and keep well stocked. Unlike Diablo however, this game is more open world style and isn't top down, so if you want a more modernized rpg with a Diablo like combat system, you've found it (heck even the health orb is reminiscent to Diablo). There are three different classes, melee archery and magic (Diablo much) and you are able to become a hybrid of these three classes should you choose to. Each class has their own set of skills available which you can learn in any order you please but before you can begin leveling up your character's skills you need to buy skill books to learn the skills initially (formerly learned from trainers in the first game) in order to use them and to level them up.Melee learn skills which can assist them in staggering the opponent and breaking guards, they can also deal extra damage, one move in particular allows you to deal considerable damage to an enemy but is only useful against an enemy who is left open to attack as is is easily blocked and hard to connect with. Using these skills also allows you to interrupt enemy attacks so you should use them wiselyRanged learn skills which can alter their elemental attributes and affect the speed and damage, most ranged skills are passive. There is a sniper mode however it is badly implemented which makes it useful only to pick off foes who haven't noticed you yet which is useless in many of the games dungeons due to their lack of space.There is also a ""sneak"" class however sneaking isn't effective enough to be considered a class of it's own, sneaking doesn't seem to work well in this game and it is simply easier to not bother with it.Mages are arguably the most diverse class as Two Worlds 2 allows the player to customize their own spells to create new ones using spell cards which give mages devastating effects. This is one of the games strong points as it allows you to experiment and be creative which is always good. the only problem is that their strength is limited, very much like in Diablo, unlike melee classes which become stronger and deal more damage with strength, mages do not get stronger with willpower as it merely gives you more mana and grants access to higher level mage skills, this is rather disappointing and in the later half of the game you will usually end up using ricochet spells simply because they are the best spells available and deal the most damage just so the mage can keep up with the other classes.The melee class is arguably the strongest in terms of base damage but they are required to use potions often, however the mage is a lot more versatile and can take out enemies at a greater range and it's spells can hit multiple targets making it somewhat more deadlier than melee. Ranged isn't really much different from melee other than it is long range. On paper ranged are the best choice of class but they most certainly aren't as they lack the complexity of that of mages and they don't have enough skills to balance with the other classes, unless you are best on being a ranged character i would strongly recommend against it as you will find the other two classes far more interesting.In terms of inventory and equipment, Two Worlds 2 feels a lot less diverse than the original which is disappointing, you will likely be stuck with the same armor you start with for a very long time and will be unable to upgrade until later. However the inventory system has made several improvements, items are a lot more clearer now on the screen and it is easier to organize, one of the few gripes i have about it though is that when you equip an item, it just shows a highlight marker so if you're not careful, you could accidentally sell it to a merchant. There is a new crafting system to replace the combine system from the first game making it far more balanced and you are able to dismantle items and save their parts for later to upgrade other equipment. There are also gems which you can socket into your gear to give them added effects, you can also combine them to make higher level gems using the fusion skill. You can also colour your own equipment using pigments to give your equipment the colour you desire, though not every equipment can be colored.Due to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ character limit, i'll have to cut the review from hereRead full review here: http://www.destructoid.com/blogs/Terry+309/underrated-two-worlds-2-review-268357.phtml ",66,4,0,11,2,0,3

												This game is one of my favorite games. It has so much free roam and the story was great. Every time I play this game I have so much fun. There are some minor problems, but critics tore it apart for these issues. I must say it was very unfair too, as these issues were not game breaking and the critics completely ignored a great game because of them. Cons-Everything above the mouth on your characters looks lifeless. In other words, your eyes and nose don't move (but your hair does). -The money system is a little messed up. (The best way to make money is by the ""Guitar Hero"" mini game.)-Changed the outcome from the ending of the first game. -The voice actor for the hero is a little bit off. (I liked his deeper voice, but I can understand why some may not).-The ending is a little frustratingReally that's about it, yet critics would fixate on one minor issue and act like it was something big. That's why this game has become a hidden gem.This game has so much going for it. There are loads of side quests on top of an already decent sized main line. The environment graphics are great! It looks good in all places, especially for 2011. There is lots of free roam and mechanics that you will want to explore.Pro-The alchemy system is fantastic-The ""Guitar Hero"" mini game is fun and addictive-The story is quite interesting-Lots of dungeons to explore (including a set of 10 dungeons that you can't use your map in and the entire thing is completely dark)-Great level system once again-Awesome magic system that has some real fun depth. (Look at some Youtube videos to see what I mean)-The whole game feels so original. -ONE OF THE BEST SOUNDTRACKS IN A GAMEThis is such a great game. I have finished it about 8 times on console. Sure there is not Skyrim free roam capability, where you can spend hundreds of hours on a single save, but this game has a solid run through of around 25 hours. If you are a completionist, you can add another 5 or so hours. I could rave on and on about this game.I hope the developers make another. It doesn't have to continue this story line, but their game is very addictive. I love their games. I wish this game could have kept that Old English charm the first game had, but I understand they probably wanted to appeal to a larger crowd. I absolutely love this game. It was a steal @ $20! Highly recommended. 10/10 easy.			",64,4,0,36,15,0,34

Mandatory registration with way too much personal info required. Glitchy graphics, poor regionalization, horrible dialogue, male is only character choice, very limited customization, multiplayer is not for campaign.

												Keep in mind i have less than an hour on this game.With that being said, lets take a look into what i think of this game.1st. The tutorial feels too long- after what feels like a step by step guide to how to play, on a basic scale.  I feel tired of the  game already, from learning to running, jumping, how to sneak, attacking, blocking, finally after learning it all over with different weapons. keep in mind, you're learning how to do all this in a span of an hour. Its not entertaining at all, when they could throw in a press LMB to Attack followed & RMB to block.  Rather than there method of doing a full two cutscenes and a one on one battle to learn just that move.  If that's the case make a training room or tutorial button in the menu that ran you through it.  Not try to blend it in with the story.  2nd. The main character- Now this is my biggest problem, it kills the game for me, i can deal with a long tutorial but this will stick with me the whole game.  Its sad to say, but i hate how the main character sounds, like a bad guy in some old time bad film trying to like he is a terribly drawn out hero. making it  hard to follow a story that can not be take serious, its all like some big silly joke, that i did not find funny apparently.  With that said i want to touch on the character creation screen.  you get what, 5 options?  how large of shoulders, chest, and leg length.  what is the point of having a creaton screen when its really how tall you want your guy?  There is no female option since it would bother the story line, you can't change the descent enough hair style. 3rd. The combat- the very little that i player i did encounted some bad guys so to speak, and i had to fight them.  Nothing more to say than the fact i feel as if later through the game, ill be clicking, a lot.  Im sure it will get harder later on but for now im saying the combat is really badly done.  I tend to notice very little use of the movement keys during it since it makes you go crazy and turn your back on the locked on enemy. very big flaw i'd say.4th. Character animation- At points you can clearly see the mouths not matching the words spoken. Some movements feel as if im watching a kids show.  the movement looks really silly in cutscenes at times.  I could ramble on about a few other flaws but its not drastic enough to mention. So moving on, lastly what i find actually amusing about the game.1st.  The scenery- now i am a big fan of dragons, though there is maybe too much dragons placed every where.  I can't say i hate it.  Then once you actually get outside you can see a beautiful landscape, with plenty of vegitation.  Even the intro clip has an clever way of showing it.  No doubt they captured my eye showing the orc, i guess, fleet docking on the shores to charge the castle.  So a plus on that,2nd. Credit- In the short time of me playing this game i was able to find more bad about it than good.  Other that have many more hours than me could say other wise.  I do give them credit though its not a terrible game. Its not unplayable and im sure it evens out in bad and good later on.  though I may not ever see the ending of this potentionally good game.  Don't let my opinion stop you, im not saying the game is trash, or so bad that it makes me cry.  I rather not be treated like a kid growing up, and get straight into the action.  If you feel the same, i would say wait for a sale.  If you do not agree with me, feel free to go on ahead and purchase this game.  I just hope you get back what you paid for from it.*Also this is the first review that i actually took time and sat down and really said a lot about a game.  I appologise for anyone that disagrees and feels offended.  As well to those notice the many grammer mistakes, take note that i am writting this at 6:17 am in the morning from staying up all night.  thank you * ",289,31,2,24,32,2,19

												They said it would be better than the first, its actually a lot worse. Skyrim, The Witcher, Path of Exile, Borderlands 2, or Fallout New Vegas could satisfy your need for all sorts of RPGs while this one should just be forgotten about. It tries to be a lot of things, and ends up being somewhere below the halfway point of what they were trying to accomplish. Its just so poorly done, but I admit theres fun to be had, its just really frustrating to find it.			",222,32,3,27,22,4,45

												Pros+ Beautiful environments+ Decent RPG elements+ One of the best magic systems out of any RPG I've played (craft spells from scratch)+ Multiplayer is a LOT of fun; best feature of the game, if enough players are there+ Simple, but effective crafting systemCons- Combat is awkward- Story makes no sense- Quests and voice acting are hilariously cheesey- Becomes too easy rather early into the game- World feels segmented and disconnectedNotes1. Multiplayer allows for different game modes, such as duel (against other players), co-op adventures, and more.2.

												While Two Worlds 2 is slightly better than the first, it has better graphics and voice acting though speech sync is done poorly, a characters mouth will be moving, but no words are said until 2 to 4 seconds later and seems to have the same sort of story about some guy that has to rescue his sister.I tried to play it, but it feels so clunky, lacking any polish and usability and I feel so bored and uninspired playing it, dialogue is rather lengthy, poorly written and boring. Even though it was only 8pm when playing it Iam falling asleep from boredom at forcing myself to play.While those aspects are boring exploring the world is the most fun and I like the crafting but the game can be so frustrating a grom 1 hit kills you with an arrow and my character dies very easily and feels so weak.Another sub par average nearly bad game. I only give it 5/10 as it's slightly better than the first. ",74,18,0,13,12,1,2

The way the tutorials work is they hold your hand through everything, while trying to blend it in with NPC dialouge. as if the previous game had never exsisted.I do not reccomend buying this game.Buy the Regular Two worlds if you think this or the GOTHIC series looks cool.(Gothic because its outdated)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But its not enough to throw a fit and not play it. Honestly, I give it a 8/10 its such a huge step forward from the first Two Worlds game. I really hope they can find a way to make a third one, because Two Worlds II is absolutely an awesome game all around. If you don't own it, buy it. It will be worth it.			",65,8,2,21,2,1,3

												I love this game. This is the third copy of the game I've bought. It's an overlooked classic. Do you like b movies with cheesy lines? Well, this game has that kind of tone. The story really has a way of being playful and not taking itself too seriously. I remember playing this game while waiting for Skyrim to come out. When Skyrim did arrive, I thought the story was just too serious. Game play wise, TW2 is really only fun if you specialize in bows. Yes, similar the the Souls games, this is one of those games that you have to play a certain way to enjoy. It's a ton of fun to play hit and run with the special abilities of the bow. By the midpoint of the game, I would shoot a distraction arrow, then a freeze arrow if there was more than one enemy, followed by either a multi-shot or fire arrow. Crowd control is fun in this game. I love that the enemies don't scale in this game. Not only does this make the game more realistic, but it makes taking out enemies leveled higher than me quite fun. Don't miss this game. It's an underappreciated classic. Sadly, not many people gave it a chance.			",7,0,0,5,0,0,2

												this game is one of the best RPGs i have ever played.Pros:-wide story line-a lot of side-objectives-a lot of different Mobs and enemies-a really huge world with different kinds of people...-long game play-has many things to do such as alchemy, forging, crafting , etc.-you can forge your character in 3 classes, such as : archer , mage , warrior but these 3 classes can be optimized inside too.. like mage class has so many different spells and u can become master in them like, fire , wind , lighting , necromancy , etc.-music is very good and relaxingCons:-kinda bad multiplayer-has some issues with the physics, but they were fixed in the DLC-story isn't that hopeful i expected something else...something more influencing-asks too many questions at the beginning-you have to play the first game to understand the story, but you will catch it by time even if you have not played the first onei recommend you to buy this game if you are fan of RPGs, this game offers you many experiencesand good news is the Two worlds III will be available soon.

												An incredible magic and item management system, a beautiful, open world, and a roster of interesting characters that inspire empathy are marred to unplayability by bugs, broken DRM, extremely unbalanced mechanics, bad voice acting for the main character and about a third of the interactions, and a blase storyline. Pros: --The magic and inventory management is hands-down the best I've seen in an RPG in decades. This alone has kept me investing my hours in this game. Do-it-yourself spells and every item in the game upgradeable and able to be dismantled into the components needed to upgrade anything makes character building a treat. --Though the character models and textures look like something from 2003, the post-processing is very good, and the world is vast and full of surprises. --Between dice, grinding, pickpocketing, vendors that buy and sell at different prices, and a DDR-like musical minigame, there's plenty of ways to make money.--horses, boats, and fast travel - you can get to where you need to go quickly. It's almost too easy...Cons:--extra DRM! The Steam release of TW2 did not have the original CD DRM stripped, and the activation server is almost constantly down or unreachable. You will have to call a German number and manually activate it, or find the developer forum and email the head developer to have him manually activate it. This game came out in 2011, not 2001 - this is outright unacceptable, and if not for Steam's no-refunds policy, I would be screaming for a refund. (Glares menacingly at Ubisoft and EA for the same sin)--Yo Dawg, I heard you like DRM... Used one of the patches before the end of Chapter 1? Uh-oh, you have to re-activate at the end of Chapter 1! --But not in the GoG.com version. Seriously. --Bugs. Do not upgrade before Chapter 2, every patch breaks locked doors that require using cheats to unlock in Chapter 1. Some quests get bugged horribly, and some vendors never open up after dawn ever again. Save often, you never know what will screw up. Getting bugged through walls and off cliff edges, items skyrocketing because collision detection went insane, items that don't deposit into inventory correctly...ugh. --Butt-ugly inventory management system. It really is one of the most innovative ever, but damn is it ugly. can't move anything in stacks, have to click an ""are you sure"" dialogue, meaning selling 30 of something is 60 clicks, what is equipped on a different build is not highlighted in any one build, so accidently dismantling or selling another build's items happens. And Equipped items are not moved to the top or a special area, they stay scattered in inventory. --Unbalanced gameplay. Sword and board? You can take out most enemies anyways. Fast hits interrupt attacks, meaning slashing quickly disables an opponent. I've taken out things 20 levels higher than me. There's a mod to fix this, but seeing as the enemies and spells are stupendously unbalanced and grinding to meet an opponent between every quest gets tedious, it feels pointless.--The magic system is utterly broken. The magic system is innovative beyond belief - and that's its downfall. Random objects like anvils, stones, and barrells can be summoned, thrown around by force spells, and the like. But spells that concentrate stones toward a single enemy can one-shot everything. Meanwhile using missile splitting consumes almost the entire mana pool for a tiny fraction of the damage. Hypnotize doesn't work, altars are titanic and can easily wall off the innumerable small hallways in the game (but luckily don't summon for much longer than a minute). A lot of enemies are strong against or immune to most of the weapons and magic you can garner. Just use a mace and fire, because everything else does little to most enemies in the game, there's only a handful resistant to fire, and they fall quickly to a mace. And on top of all of this, until about halfway through the game, just because the player is commonly in the 5 digit money category, magic is expensive as hell. Invest at least enough in strength to use a good club as a mage, because you sure as hell aren't casting or making more than a few dopey spells until the second continent opens up. --Censorship. Plenty of swearing and violence, but no blood, no nudity, and even though there's a ""sex scene"", there isn't one - you just see her butt, she and the lead almost kiss, cut to black, wake up the next morning and never see the character again. Anticlimactic (pun intended). Armors can be recolered, so there's a decal system, but no blood. This feels like something from 2003. With The Witcher coming from Europe, I mistakenly thought a German game would be as no-holds-barred. Nope. Those Germans got it rough. If you want this game, and it does have a few things going for it, get it from GoG - that version has the independent DRM stripped out, and works better to boot. We all learn from mistakes; TopWare and Reality Pump have made some beautiful trees in this game into an ugly forest - let's hope they learned from this walking mistake.			",39,7,0,9,1,0,6

Forget the fact that players have the keys on the Steam overlay and that copy+paste has been a thing for decades. The game makes every new player manually enter four serial numbers and fill out a form with all their personal information before it lets them play.

												It's a great game. I really, honestly do love it. It is an open world RPG in the third person. You face many enemies. One of my favorite (and, a lot of the time the thing I hate most of the game) is how you start getting behind in levels to your enemies. They do not level up with you - they stay the same level. This requires you to either face VERY challenging enemies or do side quests a LOT to keep up. The thing I could say I dislike about the game is the combat system. It's fun at first, but it gets old fast. It is also very glitchy. However, it's an overall great game with my certain recommendation!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gameplay is smooth, combat is simple when you get used to it, the controls don't feel clunky like Gothic 4 ( where you can spam pick-up and the character does 20 squats before picking up the item and where hitting enemies is a chore ).The game has plenty of side-quests, twists, and more. The price I paid wouldn't have even gotten me a movie ticket, or a popcorn at the movies, at that was with buying it 3 times; For a game from 2011, it definitely plays quite well.If you think the price of a few coffees, a movie ticket, or a few soft-drinks is worth it, consider the cost to entertainment value for a game like this and buy it. If you're on the fence about the $20 price-tag, wait until it is on sale ( the bundle sites still have it too at a steal ) but at $10, it is more than worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of all, we need to realize it’s a B-class game from a relatively small studio, so comparing it to SKYRIM is not completely correct. Sure the game tries to be SKYRIM, but it’s not there yet.   In a way, it's like comparing Hundai Equus to Mersedes S Class. Yeah, Hundai tries very hard, but something is missing; however, it doesn't mean Hundai is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ car.    Since we got that issue out of the way we can take a look a the game. I can say for myself, I like it, it has a lot of value for the money, sure combat takes a little getting used to, but it's not a chore (well, not for me anyways). Magic system REALLY ROCKS. It's actually VERY FUN to be a mage, you can experiment with you magic cards and get some bad♥♥♥♥♥spells combinations. Just don't forget to use a second quickbar for your spells (alt+F6 by default), this way you can utilize all buttons 1-0 without any problems.   Story and voicing are a bit cheesy, but like I said, it's a B class studio, so, personaly, I can live with that and it kept me going.Overall I really liked this game, especially with some mods, including WORLDMERGE.    In conclusion, I would give this game a chance, hey, if you think it's♥♥♥♥♥♥ you can always get  refund within 2 hours. Cheers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought the Velvet Edition when it was on sale a while ago, and when I finally got around to installing it, it expected me to fill out a registration form, asking for things such as name, home address and etc. Some internet research later, turns out there was something i had to uncheck. And then after finally getting past Demo Mode, I could only play a man. With a ridiculous amount of facial modifiers. The graphics were ok I suppose, but it was like the game was trying too hard to be creepy. The voiceacting was laughable. And the combat... Well basically you smack someone over the head with a mace until they fall over. But I would definitely not recommend this game to a friend.			",136,57,4,29,16,0,9

												Two Worlds II is a decent enough game with relatively unique gameplay mechanics and what-not. The multiplayer and singleplayer are both fun, though the game loses difficulty fast as you progress, as your character turns into a demi-god in terms of power (not intended, just something that can happen if you focus skill distribution).I'd recommend it during sales; you probably won't regret it if RPGs are your sort of game.

												Was excited to play this game.. The game looks great but right off the bat there's one thing that irritates me, why is there a Raven Cry advertisment in the lower portion of the main menu screen? I bought the game, it's not like its a demo or trial, the advertisment ruins the main menu screen!  And so far I can't find the the button to make it go away, was very disappointed..

												All I want to say about this game is that it is pretty good if you can get past the way the engine looks. The gameplay mechanics are different from most RPGs but it is still fun and rewarding. I have played a bit of this on PS3 and enjoyed the gameplay so much I got the Velvet Edition on Steam. The Voice acting isnt the worst I have ever heard but it is not that great as well. If you are in the mood for a good storyline and rewarding combat and magic system then this game is right up your alley. If you are very picky and cant get past the graphics, voice acting and learning how to do the magic system then stay away.... Until at least the new expansion comes out that is supposed to update the engine. Then it may be even better. I for one cannot wait!			",54,5,0,23,2,0,22

												I have mixed feelings about this game. The world is beautiful, and the main quests (and some side quests) involve actual C&C, and allow you to take sides here and there, which adds a lot to the story. There are often surprises to be discovered, when there is more than meets the eye to a quest giver or his motives. However, other than that the game suffers from almost every common problem seen in a fully open world RPG. For one thing, it's a lootfest. You'll be collecting a huge sack of stuff that you'll never need. Inexplicably, that includes a whole lot of buffers for situations you'll never encounter. (I really wish that developers would give some thought to the looting. Make it worthwhile. Give me something really powerful to buy. Give me a situation where I'll need a frost buffer.) Secondly, the story telling is choppy at times. I've finished the game but I wouldn't be able to explain the plot to anyone, just the same way I would be able to explain the plot of a poorly edited B-movie. Not that it's all bad. Sometimes the story can really grab your attention, especially when you're unexpectedly trapped or surprised to find out the identity of the serial killer you were looking for. The people who made this game can tell a good story, but they don't do it consistently. It's almost like the problem was organizational rather than lack of talent. An RPG with C&C is very hard to plan, and this game is a bit rough around the edges as a result. The story could also benefit from real professional writing, and some more complex lore. The lore of 2W2 is very thin and lacks a sense of politics and philosophy. The societies it portrays smack of modern day social norms rather than the humility, grit and fear of the medieval world. It's obvious that the game writers have played The Witcher, because they (loosely) copied some of its stories, but 2W2 lacks the unity of that game and its atmosphere and creative direction. That being said, some of the side quests can be unexpectedly deep and long, which was a pleasant surprise. The graphics, as I already said, are beautiful. The vistas are nice. The grass. The water. The shadows. Light shining between the branches. Aside from the nasty screen tearing, it looks better than many more recent RPG titles. Unfortunately, it looks like they were cheap on artistry. The design of everything is cliche. Your mage wears a pointy hat that makes him look like Disney's Merlin. The game features three continents and a number of smaller islands. It looks huge, until you find out that the biggest continent is used mostly for multi-player (which I admittedly haven't tried yet). The assets are reused in a subtle way so they don't get boring. For example, there is a university, and then there are ruins of a university in a dark place called the Swallows. They're almost copies of the same thing, but this is difficult to notice. I wish, though, the devs had made exploration a bit more rewarding. There are too many places where there is just a dead end or some nearly useless loot. The combat, while fun at times, lacks tactics. I played as a mage, and most of the fights in the game consisted of me casting a summon spell that surrounded the enemies with my summoned decoys that trapped them. Then I zapped these enemies with seeking fire balls. Really, this was a way of exploiting the stupidity of the AI, the fact that the AI cannot push over or walk over another (even much weaker) character and also the fact that the collision detector doesn't detect friendly fire and my fireballs pass right though the summons. In other words, 90% of the fights in the game are ridiculous. The combat system is also prone to the standard run back and forth spamming health potions abuse that is so common in this kind of game. It's made all the easier by the fact that your character can outrun anything. I should also add that the health bars, magic bars and any other bars in the game are about 2-5 times as long as they should be. A typical fight will require 20-50 fireball spells for a single enemy, late in the game. The magic system is a bit innovative. You can cast fireball summons, for example. Theoretically, you can combine dozens of spell cards into almost any elaborate spell. In practice, however, only some combinations actually work as a spell. If you play as a mage you'll be firing ""guided missiles"" for the whole game and not much more. The game adds a few interesting touches here and there. Your character talks to himself in some situations, and even makes fun of enemies. You can ride a horse, and even race it. You can buy a boat and visit one of the smaller islands (which just has enemies and loot in it). The alchemy system allows you to use almost anything that you loot in a potion. (Unfortunately, you'll be making mostly potions you never need. (As a mage, I didn't need the stamina boosters, accuracy boosters or even the magic bar booster potions.) Over all: a notch better than ok, 9/10			",187,35,1,14,13,0,21

												Two Worlds 2 is a third person, open world medieval RPG with better graphics than its predecessor and has slightly better voice acting but the the words are out of sync with the characters mouth movements. At max settings, the environmental graphics can almost be breath-taking at times, especially the ambient lighting and textures. The same cannot be said of the character models, which aren't ugly exactly, but they have wooden faces and movements. Wooden animations also plague the fighting along with terrible MMO combat and the clunky feeling of the controls. The spell casting seems weak and not very effective. The story is not original, its been done before with a few different twists here and there, but doesn't compel me to want to continue. Riding horseback is as slow as molasses, you can move faster on foot. It might look decent, but the underlying mechanics of the game are just flawed. Its clunky and glitchy like the first game, with a boring cliche' story. It has the same ridiculous Reality Pump DRM and you have to input a key and activate before you can play the game. They want your name, address, telephone number, DOB, gender, and e-mail address. It seemed extremely over the top intrusive considering its on Steam and I'm not going to play the multiplayer part. After all that, the game was...a waste of my time and money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unfortunately, I have to give this game a thumbs down.I am playing the Mac version and I have to say there are SO many bugs. From the game crashing, music randomly stopping, character stops gaining skill points, some enemies are unbeatable until I reload, and more.Game really does look nice though! Really liked the atmosphere.I could only log about 10 hours on the game (even though for some reason steam says 3) before the bugs got too frustrating to deal with. PC verion may work better, I have no idea.Combat and inventory are very clunky. But, crafting has a whole different approach which I really like.Wish this game could have worked well for me seemed to have good potential.			",40,48,0,11,7,0,4

												While alot of the things in this game disappoint me, I have to say that this is the best magic system I have ever came across in any game, ever. (Seriously, buy this game, but only when it's 80% off.)But this cannot override how crappy almost everything else in the game is. 1. Let's start with animations:My character's running looks like a japanese schoolgirl running towards senpai (the kneecaps face inwards when running), his attack movements (especially spellcasting) are just off. The horses I guess are okay, but a little clunky in movement. 2. Menus and stuff:While the developers have tried to add a sense of fantasy into the menues, gold and blue don't go well together, especailly in this game. Their dragon thing surrounding the health bar looks extravagent. They should try a more minimalistic design.3. Quests: While the quest system is fine, the objectives and how you get there is often confusing and hard to navigate. Also there's nobody you can ask for clues, or even to repeat the quest dialougue. However, in some situations the quest navagation system is too straightforward, and I literally skipped through half the plot and beat the boss without really knowing the Story while I spent the other half of my time trying to scale mountains and get to the destination before realizing there was a shortcut that can only be opened after completing the quest there. While this might sound intruiging, I assure you it is not after 3 hours of rigorous scaling.4. Difficulty spikes:I don't know if this is just me, but there have been huge difficulty level changes ever since the start. The game expects you to grind, and if you don't, you can't progress. When I was in the swamp navigating my way through undeads, it took me ten minutes to kill 7 of them, and that was using summons and heals all the way through. While about ten minutes before, I was tearing through monsters in the last chapter easily. While this may sound like a personal complaint, I think TW2 should at least offer you a decent difficulty slope from chapter to chapter.5. FInal boss:I spent the entire game building weird magic spells that held so much potential they could be viewed as cheats, and the final boss turns out to be an FPS. 6. Voice acting:Don't turn on the sound, just don'tOverall, although I rated it down, this game is worth getting (ONLY ON SALES WHERE THEY ARE 80% OFF)The innovative magic system alone makes this game worth at least a few hours. But fair warning, don't expect much out of the game other than the supercool magic system.			",82,16,0,20,10,0,4

												First impressions:Two Worlds 2 is an RPG, similar to Gothic, Elder Scrolls and Risen. It stands out for it’s kick♥♥♥♥♥magic spell system. They’ve come up with this do-it-yourself magic spell card engine which let’s you build custom spells. It’s fun and original - first time I gave the wizard-character a try in an RPG.The game did a lot of things right and overall left a user-friendly and positive impression. Pros:+ Ok graphics+ Cool character, kinda reminds me of Danny Trejo. Also, he has those small comments upon interaction which sound smart and help improve his personality.+ Super fast loading time.+ Ability to save custom outfits in case you need to quickly change from wizard to warrior etc. This should be a genre standard.+ Mobile teleport platforms was a very good idea.+ User-friendly mission guide that gives you good overview of where you have to go and what you have to do.+ Huge variety of enemies throughout the game.Unfortunately there were those tiny mistakes that could and should have been fixed and improved before the game came out. Those were mainly issues that made the game feel a little immature and green, as if the development team consisted of professionals and amateurs and everyone got to contribute. Cons:- I never got the idea behind the name ‘two worlds’. Was it supposed to be something metaphorical? I played as a wizard who looked a lot like Gandalf in his younger years and the events were taking place in a savanna/jungle so more than ‘two worlds’ the game felt like Gandalf’s Safari Adventures. - Major flaw: the game crashed left and right. I could count as much as 5 crashes in 2 minutes. Then again that truly helped me appreciate the quick loading times.- Character design was way over the top. All those ridiculous, skimpy armors and gosh, those shoulder plates!- The Voice Acting ...this was such a major one. When you take a person with a normal voice and tell him to imitate a funny sounding person, then it sounds like a normal person is making funny sounds. That happened throughout the game. Voice acting in this game might be the worst I’ve ever experienced. - The script/ writing. The dialogues were long and dead boring, the story was unnecessarily complicated + there were completely obsolete characters. It all comes down to really bad game script.- Something that’s easily forgettable once you’re in-game, but how they implemented Digital Rights Management in this game was not acceptable. The kind of information they asked before I could play the game made me feel very reluctant and extremely uncomfortable.- NPC movement speed compared to animation was out of place. - The great paradox of Two Worlds 2 is the ability to outrun rhinos and panthers even though your stamina is depleted after 100 meters of sprinting.- Swift moving around in combat makes the enemy AI go crazy, they will get stuck behind obstacles and go into attack mode some 5-6 meters from you. - Banal, unrealistic female characters - a demoness, a vixen and a damsel in distress.- Battles boil down to how fast you can click the mouse button.Verdict:The Cons list became quite long but let yourself not be discouraged by that, those were just minor flaws, all except the DRM issue which kills the gaming world and violates human rights. Overall it was a very positive experience and introduced many new original elements that I'd like to see become a genre standard.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Amazing gem of a game hidden in mixed reviews.I have spent 49 hours on my first playthrough, finished the main game and I'm in the middle of the pirates expansion. The game is fun and refereshing in many ways. It has some of the most distinct personalities among many ARPGs I've played. They can be the stereotypical good or evil, but can also be treatrerous, insane, cowardly, wacky, sexy, hilarious. I took some weird quests that turned out to be highly entertaining. The game is well immersed in the morroccan (?) and Chinese cultures, and both are done very well and feel authentic. The game mechanic is unique to the series, I find that it has pros and cons but has generally functioned well. Pros+Very good quests and storylines that are often not politically correctVery diverse characters to interact withA few very attractive female charactersHilarious dialogueSkill and battle systems are better than Two Worlds IThe right mouse button has a dash run/swim which is very useful for impatient players like meAmazing culture and atmosphereSome degree of realistic elements (you cannot steal in plain sight and cannot aggresively run into people)Very unique magic system, you can build your own spells using elemental cards and modifier cardsGood selection of weapons and armour, robes and staves, bows and arrows.Con-The game interface and HUGE item icons look horribly unfinishedCash poor in early game and cash is overflowing near end game, need better balanceMap pointers for quests is much better than Two Worlds I, but can still use improvements Alchemy system needs a better way of sorting ingredientsCannot play as female character. Kyra:  I wish that big♥♥♥♥♥brother of mine can be locked up by Gandohar...Tips*By default, you are harvesting monster loot by opening its inventory screen, click on the item/or click on transfer, then close the inventory. This is incredibly slow and tedious. A better way is to get rid of these steps and add the loot directly to your inventory. Setting >> Interface >> Show looting interface >> OFF. Have fun!

												I am genuinely writing this review purely on the based that I already know Two Worlds 2 is a bad RPG from an even worse prequel. So I decided to buy the game and try it out and sure enough, I am greeted with one of the worst intro to games Ive ever seen on Steam.First, you log on and it asks you to enter the 16 digit serial key. Bare in mind, I've NEVER had to do this on Steam. Never. Steam always provides it, but it doesn't seem to come up.Second, after you put in this code which, really wasnt that big of a deal, now you have to activate your account? Wait what? Is this an MMORPG all of a sudden? You have to put in your name, address, state, DOB, e-mail. Just to play a Single player game. I'm surprised I dont have to put in a Credit Card number too with some screen telling me that ""Note: Your card will not be charged! This is just to have you on file!""Third, ITS A BAD GAME. Don't waste your time with this aggressive nitpicky activation garbage just to play a bad RPG that shouldnt even exist.			",128,17,0,31,16,2,31

												This game is Quite good. Not great, but not bad.Positives:-Great magic system (I mean REALLY GREAT. like to make your own things in rgps? Now you can create spells!)-Easy to run on older computers.-Fun to play with others.-Good storyline (except the start. I was clueless on what was going on)Negatives:-Melee combat still sucks (spam click untill everything in front of you is dead)-Singleplayer is not level-based, so even at level 1 there will be really hard enemys.-Multiplayer is not barren, but most servers (towns) are empty.-Singleplayer gameplay is quite slow, and before you can use everything, you must go through this large prologue (Which also acts as a tutorial)I would rate this game a 7.5/10 ",33,3,0,9,7,0,2

												While I don't think it ranks up there with Skyrim or Witcher III, I did enjoy playing this game and it provided hours of enjoyment.  While I don't typically replay video games very ofter (with Skyrim being the exception), I have, after a lengthy break, gone back and finished Two Worlds II a second time.  Definitely worth investing in, especially during a STEAM sale or if you get it at a discount from Bundle Stars.			",12,2,0,10,4,0,0

												Two Worlds was an interesting fantasy game, it was flawed but there were objects and systems in it that I really liked. Two Worlds 2 picks up a little bit after where the original left off and you are still just as much in the dark as the first one. Gandohar is doing somethin evil, but his motives are never really explained nor what has happened in between the two games.One thing that really bugs me about this game is that a lot of the things in this game have to be worked around and serve no purpose other than to make things needlessly difficult. For example, spell usage in the previous game was a useful way to mix swordplay with elemental attacks and healing to save you from death. In this game spells can only be used with a staff and the system for using spells in convoluted and requires lots of study and experimentation. Spell cards can be bought, but they are ridiculously expensive.Movement is blockier, akward, and running is hard to control or stop. Horse riding can help you cover long patches of land quickly, but the horse is hard to turn and jump with, and you can easily lose track of him while on foot.Finally, the overlay system of the last game (which let you combine two of the same weapons or armor pieces to make an improved version) is replaced with a crafting system where gear is improved with materials found by breaking down other gear. While not worse than the old system, it's still another unessecary thing to worry about.Overall, I would reccomend you play the first game before you play this one otherwise you may be unhappy with the systems and mechanics and not give it a try.

												This game has the most boring and cringe worthy story of all ♥♥♥♥ing time. I hate the characters I hate the plot I hate the fact that orcs are good guys (Cause they are evil in every other universe other than WoW but I dont like WoW so whatever) I hate the character you play as. BUT, this game has some mechanics that really outshine its competition. The magic system is the best and most fun to use I have ever seen, as you dont just learn spells, you craft them, and if you invest a lot in magic, you can have multi-stage spells. For instance, I made a spell that starts as a powerful homing fireball that blasts an aoe of fire that spawns a jackel-man warrior on impact. I also made a spell that turns me invisible and allows me to walk on water, which is very useful in the late-game. The fact that you can summon an undead army to fight your foes is awesome! Especially when you are going up agaisnt a large group of enemies, because its like two clashing armies in some battles. TO BAD THE GAME CANT HANDLE THIS AND ♥♥♥♥ING CRASHES EVERYTIME A BIG BATTLE STARTS. The biggest problem with this game is that for every awesome badass thing this game has to offer, there is always something holding it back. The game crashes whenever a big battle starts, the story campaign forces you to do quests in an area of a big open world map before going to the next section of the world, dialog options dont matter because you are either accepting or declining the quest given other than in one instance that i can remember, and you fail if you choose the one I would have chosen in real life, as the only evidence against the accused is the supposed victims accusation and nothing more. Aparently thats enough to condemn this man or else the victim KILLS THEMSELVES. Great, I love being wrong for keeping a cool head in tragedy and not calling for the death of a man based on the charges alone AND NOTHING MORE. The armor customization is cool but is held back by a lack of options for dye colors and what can be worn with what, relatively interesting side quests are held back by a lack of explanation or closure. ""These gaurds are so devout that they stuck to their posts, even AFTER DEATH!"" Why are they still gaurding an abandonded factory in the middle of nowhere? Who cares just kill them! Having a boat and being able to sail around is pretty cool, too bad there is very little to see out at sea. People keep calling you handsome but you never score. The biggest land mass in the game is unaccesible FOR THE ENTIRE GAME AND YOU CAN NEVER ACCESS IT EVER. This game has some truly great ideas, the alchemy is strong and worth a damn, the magic is more than your genereic RPG main-character-learned-fireball! system where YOU the PERSON are learning how to craft truly awesome spells. And its a pretty good loot fest, and has some monsters I have never seen before that are original and not copy-pasted in the game. But again, these things are held back by problems seen for the prepevious game, its buggy (which sometimes actually make this game better as you can bypass some of the BS world checkpoints), the story and characters SUCK, and the combat is just ridiculous. It seeems like there are bits of this game wanting to really break the mold and just go crazy and take you on a wild ride, but the rest of the game is to afraid to take any chances or do anything interesting. So to conclude I would recomend this game to you for around 25$ or 30$ at the most, cause your enjoyment really depends on how much you enjoy magic and how much you can stomach this games short comings. If these people make a third installment I personally will buy it, cause I can almost feel this game trying to spread its wings and sore above most of its competetors. Hell, if they ditched the crap story and just said: ""Make you and do what you want, experience this world!"" and made this game function properly, I feel like that game might even beat out Bethesda's ELder Scrolls next game. Imagine, a game where you had the potential to be the most baddass mage who could make his own guild and RULE THE WORLD whithout being hampered by some BS story where you take orders left and right and basically be the errand boy of people you could EASILY kill at your whim. I would love a game that just says: ""There is a huge, baddass world out there just waiting for you, GO GET EM TIGER!"" I dont care who makes that game, I will buy it, and I wouldnt care if was more than 60$, if it delivers, I would still buy it.EDIT: This game crashed 15 times in 15 minutes during what could have been an epic battle between my ubead soldiers and a tribe of jacklemen.

												Despite of the real efforts in graphics and the best UI i had in a rpg experience this game is ruined by its combat system.I did it on 360 and wanted to do the pirate dlc so i bought the special sale version.I'm in normal, combat means you have to hit 20 times a guy when he just kill you by 5 hits and he never comes alone.Combat is absolute what you want but far far from good and interesting.The absolute technic is to stuck enemies and kill them one by one by mashing the button, it's really bad gameplay design.Maybe i should have choosen the easy difficulty, it would have spared me a lot of time and now the only solution i have is to delete this game.So bad cause it has a lot of quality, UI, Autosave, nice graphics, sailing and it feels really good to play before you arrive to a meaningless fight...I'm at the first boss and it's quite a mess, even Dark soul did not give me that difficulty cause IT WAS DESIGN.Don't buy it even if it's cheap on price cause it isn't on wasted time.

												I had bought this game some time ago on disk (now unplayable due to computer/Windows progression) so when the game come as a download in Steam I decided to buy it. I previously finished the Pirates of the Flying Fortress many years ago but hadn't finished Two Worlds and wanted to finish it. To my surprise it didn't live up to my expectations. The Function keys were difficult to remember like F7 for map when I am used to M on other games but I dealt with that ok. I remembered how the game went in the past and things were coming back to me on how to play it. What stopped me from continuing to play was the fact that the game crashed too often. What I mean is that I would be questing, then I wanted to bring up my map to look at my location and instead the game wouuld put me on the desktop. This happened too often and so I tried to deal with it by saving frequently but it got annoying. I would not recommend this game because of this fact. It wasn't just the map function, it happened on other functions like bringing up my skills, etc. Strange, I don't remember this problem when I played the game in the past from the disk.

												Two Worlds 2, everytime I come back to it it somehow can impress me all over again, from all the RPG mechanics to the amazing looking vistas. This is a truely wonderful RPG experience.The first time I played it which was a few years ago, I was but a meer console baby, and as soon as I played fifteen minutes I dropped the game. What a terrible choice, a few years later I decide to pick it up again and I was blown away how much sheer diversity there is in the playing styles to all the armor and loot choices. The game really does make you feel like an adventuer, from exploring crumbling caverns to a long harsh Savannah Desert to deep forests.The combat is a mixed review on my part, I feel as though they could have included a better control system even with a controller. Left trigger is sprint, left trigger is sneak and left trigger is draw. A bit silly due to all the playing styles they really had to fit alot of things in, the combat on the other hand features between an arrowing slinger Archer to a brave Warrior or just a spellslinging Mage. Even though the melee and ranged combat is pretty flawed, it really makes up for it in the spells. The ability to craft different combinations with three different enchantments, from a massive vortex to a chilling icebolt.Over all, this game has really grown on me as a RPG - I suggest this to anyone who is looking for a good RPG.

												Two Worlds II is one RPG for the lovers of this genre, the players that like a challenge and wont give up easy! I need to say... you need to be patient, the ""tutorial"" will be easy, and smooth, but then the game starts to get challenging.You will be so glad as you start make your own set of armors and wepons, you can salvage items you dont want so then you have the materials to upgrade other equipment.. You can also costumize with colors, and gems.The variety of mobs is a good point to this game, also the envoirement you are playing, you have desert of savannah, the forests, you can use a boat, there is much to explore, such dugeons, points of interest, you make your path in these big open world.The gameplay is easy to learn, good movement, nice skills, you can choose your skills depending what you wanna be, like a warrior, archer, mage (awesome magic effects and fisics by the way!!!) I didn't like how I ""finish"" the game, and then the places you have cleared, they stay cleared forever... so I cant lvl up anymore... maybe it just me.Good campaing story with drama momments and secrets that will make you curious and getting deeper as you progress the quests!I played hours of fun Two Worlds II, I believe than RPG players will like this game, even with some momments of frustration!!!                                                                   7/10			",115,6,6,23,13,0,9

A pretty good Action/RPG containing an immense world with many adventures and places to discover.The single-player mode can be a little bit confusing in the beginning if you haven't played the prequel before. The controls and menu system was a little tricky for me, because I was used to Bioware and ElderScrolls games. Pros - Vast Single-player world.- Finely optimized, nice graphics.- Clever and fun magic/spell system.- No classes, you can shape your character to your own taste.- Multi-player community is really friendly. The guys there helped me a lot.- Co-op adventures can be played with up to 8 players! (Tougher enemies > more XP)- Many game modes in multi-player. Defense, Adventure, Duel, CTF etc.- Both in single and multi you can build and maintain your own village.  Cons - Not many co-op adventures and because of this multi-player can be boring after a while if you're not intereseted in pvp.- Physics have some bugs, can be annoying sometimes- The use of bows are really confusing- Almost every attack you suffer incapacitates you, but your attacks won't do that to enemies. Really annoying!- You can upgrade your gear many times, but you can't buy resources for this - like in Skyrim. You obtain stuff only by dismantle found or bought weapons and armor.

												Two Worlds 2 is far from being a good game. And that is not because of the bad graphics, bad animations, bad voice acting, bad story, bad controls or the bad interface. It is bad because it is boring. Two Worlds 2 is boring in every aspect of the game. I do not enjoy the clunky combat, the horse riding, the fetch quests, the loot or anything in this game. In this game you are alone in a virtual empty world of braindead npc:s that gets stuck on everything and doesnt have any interesting to say or do. I just ran through a cave in the middle of nowhere facing extremely overpowered enemies just to end up in an empty room without any rewards or anything and i felt like i just wasted my time. And that is Two worlds 2 in a nutshell.			",289,87,6,51,22,2,44

												Enemies are often only defeatable if you glitch them through ANY doorway.  Combat is clunky, uncontrollable, and awkward.  Magic customization is cool, but doesn't matter when 90% of the time you must glitch enemies through terrain to even be able to hit them.  In case you were wondering, yes I am that serious.  I rarely write reviews for games, but the combat, pathfinding, bugs, and general gameplay on this game are so attrocious that I would hate for anyone else to purchase it.  I really remember two worlds 1 being much much better than this is.  Not that it was great but I found it moderately enjoyable.  The enemies and quests are so bug-ridden in this game that it is not.  In this game enemies often stop moving completely just to be repeatedly shot by arrows.  Believe me, I enjoy a good B-rated game.  But not this, it isn't nearly as fun as tw1 and even that wasn't that great.			",206,36,2,35,35,0,52

 Positive + In terms of graphics, this ends up being a positive mark for the game. While character models and animations leave much to be desired, some of the environments (and the textures themselves) are really well-detailed, including ancient Asian and Egyptian architecture, as well as some impressive lighting that is determined to showcase the best the graphics have to offer+ Taking around 10 ½ hours to complete the main story (on Medium difficulty) is a good length in and of itself. But, if you really want to explore everything the game has to offer, you can easily net yourself another 20-30 hours of gametime. There’s no shortage of side-quests to complete+ There’s an abundance of different (though basic) gameplay mechanics; from upgrading weapons via blacksmithing, to alchemy, lock picking (surprisingly one of the most fun lock picking minigames I’ve played), and even some stealth mechanics thrown in to offer some variety. And, while the combat is relatively simple, there’s a good variation of skills to use (including ones for melee and ranged weapons, as well as spells) that prevent the combat from being too repetitive or bland, and allows you to tweak your character to fit your preferred playstyle. Negative - Easily the biggest negative for me is the lack of difficulty scaling. What this basically means is: if you want to play the game just for the main story, you will have an exceedingly difficult time doing so (even on Medium difficulty). The game will force you to resort to cheap tactics in order to beat boss battles/hard encounters and run past most of the enemies throughout the dungeons, unless you complete side-quests (which there are plenty of, but I don’t think it’s fair to force the player to complete them in order to have a fair chance of defeating the main obstacles the game throws at you). This ends up making the game artificially difficult, as no matter how well you utilise or level your skills, you will have a needlessly problematic trek towards the end credits if you don’t complete optional content (unfortunately the final boss itself is rather awful as well, so I wouldn’t blame you if you felt like quitting before reaching the end)- While there are plenty of side-quests to complete, the world itself--which may be big in scale--doesn’t really encourage exploration. There are simply vast masses of land that don’t contain any meaningful sights nor secrets worth discovering, which is a shame because the world itself is quite pretty- Again, like the first game, the wooden voice acting and weak sound design in general don’t make much of an attempt to immerse you into the world of Antaloor; though I will admit, the music itself is very charming and partially redeems the sound overall - Lastly, the story itself is predictable and forgettable; no interesting main characters and nothing that hasn’t been done before. Worth Mentioning • Though people claim the game has severe DRM, all it really is is putting in a serial number, and using online activation to verify your purchase (which only needs to be done once). It literally takes only 30 seconds to do so... unless you forget to uncheck the checkbox which tells you to register (which makes you enter personal details, but this isn’t required to play the game at all). But, if you hate ‘DRM’ in any form (excluding Steam DRM), then by all means don’t bother purchasing the game. Verdict “Two Worlds II starts off as a rather clunky experience. But, once you start getting into the swing of things, you will find yourself enjoying the game more and more as you delve deeper into it. While the game is just a basic open-world RPG, with both poor and good qualities mixed together, overall this and the first game have an undeniable charm that makes them memorable (and admittedly better than they deserve to be). With some more polish here and there, this game could be even better than I’m giving it credit for.” 7/10 TJBs  ",336,61,9,32,4,1,8

												Great game. I was not expecting much from this title. I bought this game for very cheap awhile back and it took me a long time to get around to playing this. I am really glad I gave it a fair shot.It is a great RPG with a lot of original ideas brought to the table. So far, I have found the game world to be vast and the level system to be very rewarding. There are some innovative ideas brought to spell crafting, and overall I have had a lot of fun playing this so far.I have yet to try the online multiplayer but look forward to it.Highly recommended for RPG fans.

												This game requires contact details such as address, name, gender and phone number to activate and register. The cutscenes and dialogue are cheesier than a dairy farm, occasionally break (character capes flipping over their head and projecting through their chest), and there is god-awful writing throughout with bizarre sexist jokes that make little sense in context or from the characters that speak them.The customisation of your character at the start of the game allows intense modifications of the facial features you will never see through the back of your head and not much else at ALL. The early combat is about as fun and intuitive as putting a wet towel over your face and swinging a stick blindly hoping you spam the right attack to win. The keyboard controls are awful but controlling your character with a gamepad is difficult as well. And apparently the multiplayer is dead anyway.Do not buy this game.			",90,11,1,19,5,1,3

												Two Worlds II is a hidden gem with a few scratches on the surface. Poorly constructed combat and awful controls are the only glaring problems with the game. Get past that, though, and you'll uncover incredible lighting, decent graphics, an excellent magic system, a beautifully diverse game world, lots of quest variety, a fantastic soundtrack, and a decent story. With gameplay that can last you about 50 hours or so, it's unfortunate that so few gave this game a chance. I definitely recommend it to Action RPG fans!			",163,52,0,41,15,4,36

												A couple of things that makes this, otherwise perfectly functional game, a drab, slow and messy experience:1. The controls. They are aweful in general. No matter how much you fine-tune it, it always feels bulky and there is no good way to swap between weapons. 2. The inventory screens are hap-hazard at best, something that was probably nailed pre-alpha and just never got a make-over because the developers had gotten used to it. Think of it like this: it's worse thank Skyrim but slightly better than Witcher is what we're talking about.3. There is some pretty in-depth character creation but you can only be a male character for whatever plot reason.If you can live with those things, sure, get it's. It's a good game otherwise.

												After hearing how horrible this was in all the years since its release, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by this game. The voice acting is terrible, the combat is weird at times, and the context sensitive keys seem like a useless relic from console porting, but this game feels like the first Witcher, but without timed button press combat. so far much of what I have been doing is following a tiny main quest thread and running around killing monsters for people. I'm a total sucker for games with a crafting system, and even though this one is kind of bare bones(only item improvements; no actual item creation) it is still fairly rewarding. Another huge bonus somewhat related to this is that your armor actually changes when you equip new pieces. It isn't just 8 reskinned versions of the same armor ala Dragon Age: Origins. Every set so far feels like a unique and interesting enough looking piece of armor. Cloaks abound, with decent cloth physics, though I have seen one scene where the cloak was draped across a character's body the wrong way, clipping through his chest and draping over his front. I'm playing this game with the Worldmerge mod, since I have the DLC and it is reportedly more immersive this way. The game looks amazing with DX10. Whenever I launch it with DX9 it just looks fuzzy in comparison. There is a huge amount of realistic plantlife dotting the landscape. It makes grassy fields in skyrim look like child's play. After putting it off for such a long time, I feel absolutely blown away by this game.Edit: the ending is a little confusing and kind of a let down. Just...be prepared for nearly nothing to be explained.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a mixed bag to tell the truth. Massive amount of content which promise hours and hours of gameplay, that is if one is willing to overlook its flaws which make the game a chore to trudge through. Customization is fair although the single player campaign isn't as lenient and exciting as the multiplayer character customization. Combat is clunky at best and weapons dont have any weight to them, although the magic system makes up for it that is if the player is willing to be a mage above all else. There are a variety of enemies to fight against which makes combat refreshing despite the controls and horrid physics. Character models look stiff and unfinished although at times they look great (in cutscenes), maybe its the fact that the arms look really weird and unfinished. Voice acting is bearable most of the time although your character can get annoying at times. Action is pretty much average to say the most, story is decent, Two Worlds II isn't exactly going to be everyone's cup of tea but its a decent game in its own right. 6/10.			",111,21,0,20,7,2,22

												For anyone doubting how bad the DRM for this game is, and whether it being on sale means it might be worth getting anyway, I implore you not to. The fact that they demand to know your full name, location (right down to the street you live on) and gender before even allowing you to play the game is absolutely obscene. Irrespective of the games quality there is no excuse to enforce such intrusive business practices on consumers. Spend your money elsewhere, and hopefully the turd that is DRM will go away eventually.			",95,8,0,10,9,0,12

												The world is vast and a little confusing if you don't know where to go. The environment has a decent graphics also.There's a little problem when it comes to your character's body especially in his attacking phase. It looks really weird...Anyways, this is a great game for killing time.			",116,48,3,20,8,2,13

												This game is literally awesome.  Great graphics, great open world, great store, great quests - especially the side quests.  I have been thoroughly amazed by the writing and the dialogue.  The voice acting is stellar, the main character sounds like Christian Bale's Batman.  A healthy amount of coarse language, not overdone - just appropriate.  I guess my only complaint is that like the Gothic series the combat is leveled for the most part meaning once you plateau past a certain level enemies become a joke to deal with.  Sooner rather than later since you level so quickly and gain so many skills and stat boosts there isnt much of a challenge.I suggest anyone who likes the Gothic/Risen series give this game a try - its a much more polished, entertaining, coherent game that will last with you long after the game is done.

												Really like this game, the graphics and the free motion too. Like the open world and the story line for quests. It's a great game for when the cable's out and you can't get on your favorite MMORPG.But it's also a good stand alone game too.I do wish that there was a female option, like in Fable III - so that it would let you play either the sister or brother of the NPC main. But it's still playable and the chemistry between some of the other characters and the Player Character is nice too.The world isn't small either... there's a lot of game time and you can have fun killing time too. I say watch the video, check out a few game play videos and then give it a shot if you like what you see.Steam always has a great deal going on... so you may get it for a song.

												You have to press 7 buttons to shoot an arrow. If you play a fire mage in co-op be prepared to re-roll as all the first mobs are fire resistant. You can buy instruments and play guitar hero. The main character in single player has the most evil sounding voice I've ever heard in a game and upon killing enemies will say all sorts of things like ""warned you"".

I found this game.I was not very sure about this game, it starts very bland but put a few hours to it and you would love it.the cities are bigger than the Skyrim's towns, its a free-to-explore, open world RPG and its massive!the story is very good and the game is addictive, a true solid RPG.there are a few problems though, some dialogues with NPCs are a little bland, the horse riding is stupid and the menus are a tad confusing.dont get me wrong, after a few hours you would start to enjoy it and it can be a good replacement for elder scrolls series.combat is very good and fun, magic is awesome, crafting and forging is very good and you have all the cool stuff like alchemy, enchanting (sort of!), upgarding weapons and customizing your character.there are guilds to join, and tons of quests to do.dungeons, demons, undead creatures, necromancers, everything you would want from a RPG.take my advice and buy it, you will love it as much as I do!oh, and i almost forgot; this game has a true FULL CONTROLLER SUPPORT!!

												I like the magic system in this game better than the one in Skyrim . You can preset five different spells, and switch between them without stopping the action . You need a staff to use magic, but you can also use the staff defensively to hit your opponents . You make your own spells by organizing what looks like Tarot cards into amulets .... The armor looks better, after you spend some money, but the archer's clothing still looks like something Uncle Joe wouls buy at the local sporting goods store .... There's a bit of humor in the game, and plenty of dungeons .... The inventory system can be confusing at first, because of the (quick switch) system that allows you to change between mage, archer, and fighter instantly .... A spell and a puff of smoke for that (quick switch) would make it more believable .... For some reason, the thieves guild gives you the best prices on any gear .... Don't upgrade weapons and armor too much at first, because the stuff you collect as the game progresses is much much better ....The music is highly atmospheric .... Those stiff hand jesticulations that characters make when talking remind me of cheap old kung fu movies Ha Ha .			",161,13,4,29,4,0,19

												This game is a mixed bag to tell the truth. Massive amount of content which promise hours and hours of gameplay, that is if one is willing to overlook its flaws which make the game a chore to trudge through. Customization is fair although the single player campaign isn't as lenient and exciting as the multiplayer character customization. Combat is clunky at best and weapons dont have any weight to them, although the magic system makes up for it that is if the player is willing to be a mage above all else. There are a variety of enemies to fight against which makes combat refreshing despite the controls and horrid physics. Character models look stiff and unfinished although at times they look great (in cutscenes), maybe its the fact that the arms look really weird and unfinished. Voice acting is bearable most of the time although your character can get annoying at times. Action is pretty much average to say the most, story is decent, Two Worlds II isn't exactly going to be everyone's cup of tea but its a decent game in its own right. 6/10.			",111,21,0,20,7,2,22

												After hearing how horrible this was in all the years since its release, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by this game. The voice acting is terrible, the combat is weird at times, and the context sensitive keys seem like a useless relic from console porting, but this game feels like the first Witcher, but without timed button press combat. so far much of what I have been doing is following a tiny main quest thread and running around killing monsters for people. I'm a total sucker for games with a crafting system, and even though this one is kind of bare bones(only item improvements; no actual item creation) it is still fairly rewarding. Another huge bonus somewhat related to this is that your armor actually changes when you equip new pieces. It isn't just 8 reskinned versions of the same armor ala Dragon Age: Origins. Every set so far feels like a unique and interesting enough looking piece of armor. Cloaks abound, with decent cloth physics, though I have seen one scene where the cloak was draped across a character's body the wrong way, clipping through his chest and draping over his front. I'm playing this game with the Worldmerge mod, since I have the DLC and it is reportedly more immersive this way. The game looks amazing with DX10. Whenever I launch it with DX9 it just looks fuzzy in comparison. There is a huge amount of realistic plantlife dotting the landscape. It makes grassy fields in skyrim look like child's play. After putting it off for such a long time, I feel absolutely blown away by this game.Edit: the ending is a little confusing and kind of a let down. Just...be prepared for nearly nothing to be explained.			",112,21,0,39,2,0,4

The voice acting is terrible, the combat is weird at times, and the context sensitive keys seem like a useless relic from console porting, but this game feels like the first Witcher, but without timed button press combat. so far much of what I have been doing is following a tiny main quest thread and running around killing monsters for people. I'm a total sucker for games with a crafting system, and even though this one is kind of bare bones(only item improvements; no actual item creation) it is still fairly rewarding. Another huge bonus somewhat related to this is that your armor actually changes when you equip new pieces. It isn't just 8 reskinned versions of the same armor ala Dragon Age: Origins. Every set so far feels like a unique and interesting enough looking piece of armor. Cloaks abound, with decent cloth physics, though I have seen one scene where the cloak was draped across a character's body the wrong way, clipping through his chest and draping over his front. I'm playing this game with the Worldmerge mod, since I have the DLC and it is reportedly more immersive this way. The game looks amazing with DX10. Whenever I launch it with DX9 it just looks fuzzy in comparison. There is a huge amount of realistic plantlife dotting the landscape. It makes grassy fields in skyrim look like child's play. After putting it off for such a long time, I feel absolutely blown away by this game.Edit: the ending is a little confusing and kind of a let down. Just...be prepared for nearly nothing to be explained.			",112,21,0,39,2,0,4

												For anyone doubting how bad the DRM for this game is, and whether it being on sale means it might be worth getting anyway, I implore you not to. The fact that they demand to know your full name, location (right down to the street you live on) and gender before even allowing you to play the game is absolutely obscene. Irrespective of the games quality there is no excuse to enforce such intrusive business practices on consumers. Spend your money elsewhere, and hopefully the turd that is DRM will go away eventually.			",95,8,0,10,9,0,12

												TL:DR: The sequel is by far better than the original, but the flaws are still there. Get the game when it's on sale, which tends to be frequently. Below is a review of the game.Pros:- A lot of quests- Interesting storyline- Customization- Graphics- DLCCons:- Controls- A lot of quests- M. Night-esque storyline- Activating the product for main game and dlc- The damn horses. ",308,54,2,22,28,0,24

												First, the game does have its issues.  Nothing like running down a hill and taking enough fall damage to kill you, but if you press jump you can take a 50 foot jump with no damage.  Just weird and inconsistent.  And yes, you have to enter a key when you first run the game or get a DLC for the game, which is unusual and annoying at this point in time.  That being said, the land is interesting and fun, there are tons of creatures, a lot of flexibility with the story line but the biggest plus is the magic system.  You make your own spells from components and rearange the components later to suit other needs.  For instance I have created spells that shoot out a spray of missiles. The missiles blind when they hit and summon undead warriors where they land.  Another shoots a huge spray of fire missiles which bounce around filling an area with fiery death.  I've used water walking and feather fall to weasle my way into areas that, later, I realized I was supposed to get to later in the game, yet I was able to make it work.Another oddity of the game, which from my perspective, Im not sure is a plus or a minus is the multiplayer.   It has multiplayer, but unlike other games where you play the same game single and multiplayer the multiplayer game is a different game.   Same game mechanics but you gather in a city, and choose a storyline that has nothing to do with the single player game, gather your comrades and play through that scenario.  On one hand its extended, unique game play.  On the other you cant use the single player character you built up, you dont get to explore the extensive single player world and questlines with a friend and the multiplayer game has much less content.  I can still say I've had fun in multiplayer and built up a powerful multiplayer character, but its worth noting that when you read that the game is multiplayer its probably not executed the way you probably think it is. All in all I've enjoyed it an think its a game well worth exploring.			",47,11,0,20,1,0,5

												There are a lots of improvements since Two Worlds 1, graphics is now awesome, the terrain, and vegetation doesn't have repetitive rock/field textures, the maps are big, tons of quests are waiting for the player to complete them, i solved all i've found, took me 65 hours to finish everything, which is not too long, and not too short time. The quality of quests are various, there are some traditional kill x creature ones too, bring potions, etc, but overall were entertaining. Some bugs in quests made some headache. The fighting system is not a big deal, but the crafting system allows to upgrade and recycle weapons, the armor sets can be mixed colored, shaped for the player's tastes. The multiplayer doesn't worth a word.Music tracks are nicely composed, brings more color in the game, and the story is not ending here! However, the TW3 is on hold atm, since devs have other games in development, personally i can't wait to see what will happen next.			",423,90,10,48,27,3,34

												huge disappointment- the crafting / upgrading system requires a ridiculously high amount of iron, leather, fabric, etc, that you get only from dismantling other items- the main story is short and ends abruptly- big world, that feels empty- walking / sprinting is the only viable option to discover new places, since the horses' clunky annoying controls- the dungeons are not a real challange, almost empty places with a few skeletons amd no good loot, also the entrances are not marked on the map, you better not forget where you entered it- the quest markers on the map are bright blue, some people are also marked on your map, also with blue, places you can increase some stats for a short while are also shown on your map, guess with what color? blue! .. from all the colors in the world you picked 2 shades of blue and the same ♥♥♥♥ing shape, a ♥♥♥♥ing circle.. very ♥♥♥♥ing annoyingcould have been a good game, but it's not.

 My Review On Two Worlds II This is the worst game ever, I have spent god knows how long trying to play this game.First things first, I went to play this game since I liked the first one and saw thiswas cheap so I bought it, however after successfully installing and downloading it, it wouldn't run, after launch it would just not open a window or anything, so I looked on the forum and it said try restarting steam so I did that, it didn't work, it also said try restarting your computer, so I did that, didn't work, twenty minutes after it started to work, then it asked me for all this stpid information after I just bought the game asking me to buy even more things just so taht I can play it, and it would seem that apparently I PAID to play the stupid demo of a game that is years old. Second after filling in all this information and getting an email sent to me and buying a serial code, it said that my code was invalid, it said everything I tried was invalid, also everytime I want to launch the game, out of all my games it takes the longest to load and it is one of the smallest, then it makes me watch a stupid intro vid tat you can't skip. Out of all the games the story looks okay, but since I have only been able to play the demo since apparently I am an invalid player/owner of the game. Overall this is the worst game ever, and forcing  someone to fill in their personal details such as their exact location and proxy server should be illegal in which some cases it is, I will never download or play any game from these devs ever again, and I say this for all gamers, stop this miss conduct. The amount of glitches in game, is terrible.I do not recommend anyone ever plays this, I want a refund! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Positives:It has a nice world. The world itself looks pretty good, and it's cool to roam around.The character customization is pretty alright.End of list.Negatives:The controls are really confusing, especially to a beginner. There's way too many for the player's own good.Quite a buggy game. During in-game cutscenes if you're next to an object it'll sometimes fly like being hit with a giant hammer or you'll phase into it.Fights are boring. There's barely any sound or music when you fight, and it doesn't feel like you're actually fighting like in other RPG's.Voice acting isn't very good. No music during cutscenes.End of list.4/10 do not recommend.			",266,44,1,16,10,3,21

												This game was involving, had some nice RPG mechanics (interesting alchemy, smithing and magic), and was overall fun to play.That's not to say it didn't have problems, it had loads of them. But amazingly, all those problems worked towards making the game an enjoyable experience!- It had loads of janky voicing- my characters creepy laughter and the game's habit of cutting off audio dialogue if it was very long (like someone overloading me on exposition) with the next dialogue line gave my character a sort of sleazy funny personality, similar little things with other characters.- It had weird little bugs and glitches that helped with the gameplay (some seriously hard enemies I beat by exploiting this).- Awkwardly half-naked models (that the player awkwardly flirted with) and a story that probably tried to take itself too seriously gave loads of funny moments.So it might not have been a great game in the way the developers would have wanted it to be, but it is definitely recommendable for what it became.

												One of the sandbox RPG titles that is fresh, but not spectacular. It still has its gems and keeps me entertained for hours, and hours again.Its world is really big, not without its clear and sometimes annoying boundaries though. Loot is OK, I've seen better, and countless worse too.Two worlds 2 is really fun to explore, story and variety of the experience is better than many other titles. What is lacking is convincing emotional attachment. Gameplay is solid and seems to be better than narrative behind it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The best open world Fantasy RPG since Morrowind, and one of my favorite games of all-time. The amount of content in it is pretty unbelievable.  The only reason I stopped playing the singleplayer was because I beat the game and literally killed every single monster in the game's world. I still periodically load it up to play the guitar mini-game. Playing through the separate coop mode was a great bonus on top of an already immense game.

												I have to give it a negative because it has bad controls. I can ignore age, graphics, etc, but never bad control and movements. The guy walks like he has a pickle in his butt and moves with the grace of a stone block. It is hard to battle and it is not graceful. Comparing this to a fantasy game like The Reckoning, you can see the difference very quickly. Also since I was forced to play as a guy and not beable to custom make my character a girl It's another con to this game. I would never bash a game, there is an audience for this game, but it is not me. There are too many newer games with better control flow I would rather play. Sadly I am uninstalling this, there is much promise for it, but I just do not care for it.			",103,30,0,45,8,0,1

												It's not as clean and polished as most other games, but it has a lot of great elements taken from games such as Skyrim, Diablo, Assassin's Creed, and many others. It had (and still has with this year's [2016] big update coming) the potential to be a better game than all the rest surprisingly, but it seemed to fall short in many aspects. I love the items, map, NPC interactions, enemies, and especially the leveling and magic systems! Plus the difficulty feels just right and the game is seriously funny as it never takes itself too seriously, but the combat completely falls short in it's glitchiness, and story falls far, far, FAR short as it's simply complete garbage.... but still, the core game has a sort of magic to it that keeps you playing and enjoying it overall.You can see I've had to say ""but"" a whole lot in this review after trying to praise Two Worlds II, BUT if you can overlook some of it's shortcomings, and enjoy the parts where it shines, it's a very fun game for $21.99.

												This game is kind of like Skyrim's red headed step-child who had a make-over. It is somewhat entertaining in that it is a RPG experience. I just quickly lost any attraction to it as the game is pretty empty story-wise (simple, not much emotion, written for 12 year olds). While the graphics look decent, the animation just looks stiff and somewhat lifeless.I did like how they handled archery. I also liked how the loot system worked. I have a lot of games that are just better in every way though.All of that being said, it is currently $1.99. If you are hard up for a RPG, it is easily worth that much.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First, the game does have its issues.  Nothing like running down a hill and taking enough fall damage to kill you, but if you press jump you can take a 50 foot jump with no damage.  Just weird and inconsistent.  And yes, you have to enter a key when you first run the game or get a DLC for the game, which is unusual and annoying at this point in time.  That being said, the land is interesting and fun, there are tons of creatures, a lot of flexibility with the story line but the biggest plus is the magic system.  You make your own spells from components and rearange the components later to suit other needs.  For instance I have created spells that shoot out a spray of missiles. The missiles blind when they hit and summon undead warriors where they land.  Another shoots a huge spray of fire missiles which bounce around filling an area with fiery death.  I've used water walking and feather fall to weasle my way into areas that, later, I realized I was supposed to get to later in the game, yet I was able to make it work.Another oddity of the game, which from my perspective, Im not sure is a plus or a minus is the multiplayer.   It has multiplayer, but unlike other games where you play the same game single and multiplayer the multiplayer game is a different game.   Same game mechanics but you gather in a city, and choose a storyline that has nothing to do with the single player game, gather your comrades and play through that scenario.  On one hand its extended, unique game play.  On the other you cant use the single player character you built up, you dont get to explore the extensive single player world and questlines with a friend and the multiplayer game has much less content.  I can still say I've had fun in multiplayer and built up a powerful multiplayer character, but its worth noting that when you read that the game is multiplayer its probably not executed the way you probably think it is. All in all I've enjoyed it an think its a game well worth exploring.			",47,11,0,20,1,0,5

												I'm not going to pretend this game is great, it even borders on bad at times but if youre a big wrpg fan you might let some of the bad things slide and see it for what it does well.Controls are clunky and animations are stiff, but the Gameplay is solid and character progression is good, you have 3 options in how you handle combat, ranged, melee and magic, ranged is probably the worst but i didn't really experience much of it, melee is fairly basic but the skills you can get make it a little better with time, i didn't start to enjoy it until i started parrying(hitting just after blocking) and using my skills more.Magic is insanely good in this game, it works by combining different effect cards with different elements to create your own spells, i'm not sure how many spells there are in the game but a lot of them are pretty unique and creative.The story is pretty average apart from the ending, i don't want to spoil it but the last boss is really dissapointing since you don't even fight him head on.Sidequests on the other hand are great and reminded me of oblivion in some ways, although not nearly as good, you have different guilds that have different storylines that vary in length and then there are a bunch of quests in the world that are both interesting and even pretty funny at times.Graphically it's a mixed bag, aesthetically it's great, the enviroments are varied and pretty unique for a wrpg, you go from an egyptian savannah area to some sort of asian(Korean or Chinese) jungle and finally to a swamp, the assets and environments are good looking but other aspects like animations and character models are pretty bad.One final thing to note is that you have to register an account at the beggining of the game to use the multiplayer, the registration is incredibly intrusive and personal if i remember correctly and i saw that a lot of people marked the game as not reccomended because of it, which i consider completely justified, if you however decide to try the mp(and that's if it's still online)you're going to get a pretty great psuedo mmo tier experience with loads of content and even a village manager later on.

												Two Worlds II gets rid of the best part of Two Worlds - exploration. The original game was a rough RPG, it had many flaws, but it was the exploration that made it a decent game. The sequel is no longer open world, and instead it focuses on storyline, which however, is as bad as in the first game. The NPCs are just as shallow, and the combat remains the same - okay, but nothing special. In consequence, we are left with a game that is average at best, because the excitement of discovering new areas is dimnished by the fact that everything is led by the story, and hence the player cannot go sideways, try to fight much more powerful enemies in hope of much better loot than he is supposed to find. Two Worlds II becomes just an average game with nothing special. I would recommend it only for those who already completed Two Worlds and other good RPGs and have nothing to play. It's okay to kill some time, however, not really worth much. Two Worlds II is a huge disappointment. Instead of improving gameplay in the sequel, developers took away the only thing that made the original game good.			",390,117,27,79,52,1,87

												The game is great. I find it rather funny and entertaining, and my only complaint is the framerate.I'm gonna be apologetic about some things that others have criticized:The voice acting: It's not that bad. Certainly better than the majority of anime dubs out there, and really, it's pretty much on par with the voice acting in Skyrim. Which while no huge feat, is still kind of the industry standard.The dialogue:Is it perfect? No. But it is pretty dang funny. The charatcers are full of quips and one-liners with a lot of homages (You're a little short for a City Guard aren't you?) and a LOT of self-mockery, especially directed at the previous game in the series, which are subtle, but you'll catch if you play them back to back.The fighting:It's pretty straight forward attack-button mashing mostly. But when you do come up against particularly tough opponents you can usually find some way to beat them. Otherwise: go level up. It's an RPG. So of course the mobs that are hard at the beginning (Varns: which are Mummy III army of Anubis style jackal-men) become paper thin foes by 6 hours in. The plot:Save the girl. Defeat the evil Emperor. Bad guys from the first game are now the good guys. Pretty standard. Is that bad? I don't think so. It's still an enjoyable story. If you're looking a novel, complex plotline, GO READ A BOOK! It's all plot and no grind! Want suggestions? Message me, I'll give you lists. So unless you're looking to be blown away by some unexpected seldom-before-seen tale of intrigue, wizardry, and shenanigans, it's a good story.As for the sidequest stories. They're ridiculously over the top, asinine, or just straight up obvious comedic relief. One mercenary mission request is a parent and daughter locked in a cellar because there are angry ostriches trying to kill the daughter by touching her with their feathers and causing an allergic reaction. They sent the letter by carrier pidgeon. Is this serious? Clearly not. To those saying the game's stories are stupid: lighten up. Laugh at the game. Laugh at the genre. They're really picking on RPGs as a genre in this game.The mechanics:Plays like a hack'n'slash brawler. I like hack'n'slash brawlers. It can be a bit clunky at times, with your character sometimes crouch to sneak instead of running for his life, but you can fix that by changing the key-bindings I believe.Lastly, the Personal Info requirements:It's your name and address. All public information anyway. All information you've already put into Steam likely more than once. Do you really the Polish game designers care that much about you that they're going to stalk you, or ruin their business by stealing your identity? Or send you snailmail? No. It's for commercial data collection. Statistics. By knowing your address, age, and sex, they can precisely gauge who is buying their stuff and adjust marketing accordingly. That's it.

												After learning about confirmed Two World 3 and upcomming update to engine and new DLC for Two Worlds 2 I decided to play this game again (Need to finally try out rolling a wizard. They have wizard hats, so... yeah...)Lot of people will think this game is not really good. And yes, it's missing a lot. Animations some times can look... weird... Voice acting... Not the worst, some characters voiced just... Boring. Like with the idea of ""lets just finish this"". It's not terrible just without much of the emotion, makes its sound flat and boring. Character models can look pretty lame too.What's bad too, is that you can't go to multiplayer continent in singleplayer. And by that I mean, in multiplayer there is different island and it's not that small. And while playing singleplayer when opening map you can see that next huge island and you have this ""oohhhhh yeahhhh"" but later you notice that you just finished game and didn't even played there, turns out - multiplayer only.But the good thing is, theres lots of stuff to do. There's DLC too, that adds new map and stuff. Didn't even started playing that myself (whats bad about it, your character is voiced by different person and it's more annoying than the old one. But when you exploring and collecting stuff he uses lines from the main game ""oh, what is this?"" and other exploration lines that are voiced by the old voice actor, so it's sounds weird with 2 different voices).......................................................................................................................In the end I wanted to talk about DRM. It is bad and annoying, but Im not sure if most people who review and give negative rating with ""Key doesn't work"" are stu... Lets just call them... Special... Or what. I reinstalled game lot's of times, re-entered key every time I reisntalled game, just did that today too. Everything works well every time, never had single problem with activation. Key works EVERY TIME. Im not sure what people are doing to mess everything up. JUST REGISTER YOUR KEY TO YOUR EMAIL, IF YOU ENTERING KEY FOR THE FIRST TIME. AFTER THAT, IN CASE YOU ARE ASKED TO ENTER KEY AGAIN, JUST ENTER KEY AND DON'T USE ""REGISTER GAME"" CHECK-BOX, SO YOU DON'T GET INVALID KEY MESSAGE.			",283,33,8,45,21,2,30

												After 32 hours of gameplay I'm still playing this game and I don't know why. The actual gameplay is fun, but it still has so many problems. I found one game-breaking bug that trapped me in a dungeon, but I was able to get out with console commands. I can no longer stand to hear any of the dialog; the voice acting and script are both so bad.I also sailed to the largest island in the game, only to find out you can't go to it - if you happen to make it in it teleports you back to the shore. It takes a fair bit of time to get there, so don't waste your time trying. You can only go to the small islands on the map.And because I spent some time exploring around before doing missions I'm an unstoppable death machine with no equal in combat - it's starting to make things a bit boring due to the lack of challenge.-------------------------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW:I wish I could even play this game. It took a half hour of searching the internet for a way to get the game to even launch and when it did start working, it wasn't due to anything I did because I hadn't changed anything - merely tried to launch it a few more times and then it spontaneously worked (as far as I can tell). Then, once it was running, it kept crashing every few minutes. On top of all of that, they have the balls to put advertisements in the game to try to sell you other things. It also forced all control to my 360 controller I had plugged in without giving me an option to switch to mouse control, which somehow made registration impossible because I couldn't pick a gender.""Infuriating"" is a rather kind description of my experience with this game so far. I'd like to play it, and I'm going to continue to try for a little while, but after fighting to get it to work at all for this long I simply can't recommend it to anyone.-------------------------------------------------EDIT: Bandicam appears to have been what was causing it to crash. not sure why it wouldn't start up at first. The game is fun, but lips don't match dialog and characters move in cutscenes as if they were marionets. Dialog seems to jump around randomly between subjects sometimes and every now and then it just skips itself mid-sentence as if it expects you were bored.			",534,169,9,71,53,5,111

												I love this game, played it through completely at least twice.  Bought 2 copies, this one for my steam library.  Be aware that many of the negative reviews of this game are based solely upon the (quite legitimate) concerns about intrusive DRM, which we all kinda despise, especially as Steam users we aught not to be subjected to it.  That aside, once the monkey hoops are jumped through, this is an absolutely marvellous game.+ The graphics are amazing and the environments are some of the most beautiful and best of any game I have played, in face I would say THE best.  The savannah is amazing, totally atmospheric, feels like a real savannah aught to, and the Japanese-style college of magick is also gorgeous.  Like something from a dream the designer had and they made it real.  It might be a little dated now, though, that was my impression playing this back few years ago.+ The enemies are not level scaled, which I really like.  Some are very tough and cant be defeated at the start of the game, necessitating going back after your character has levelled a little.  I really like this mechanic, although some folks I know want every enemy to be beatable at any level, like in Bethesda games, which I always usually get bored of as partway through the game your character is more powerful than the game curve and every enemy is toast even on highest difficulty.  So thumbs up to Two Worlds for this, and I hope to see tough, non level-scaled enemies in Two Worlds 3 also.There are lots of other great things in this game but these are the 2 that really stick in my mind.  Horses and boats are great also come to think of it.Anyway this game should be getting 90%+ I think on recommendations, its being brought down by the DRM unfortunatley, but IMHO it's well worth jumping through the hoops to play this amazing game.

												Honestly I am actually enjoying Two Worlds II. So far I am enjoying what it has to offer, and yes with various improvements it could be golden. Then again I am not the type of gamer who cares too much whether or not a game has a ton of bugs or not. I have not personally came across any as of yet, nor anything that I would deem this game unplayable. It really brings me back to how much fun I used to have playing most MMo and RPG games, and playing it with a friend is a good experience. I am looking forward to seeing what more Two Worlds II has to offer, as again I am enjoying it so far!			",143,20,1,23,6,0,13

												Don't buy, the company that makes this game has a terrible registeration process. I honestly could not get past the tutorial because it would not let me register my product code through their website. Valve also offers no support regarding these issues. The game is actual quite good and is fun to play, but the company that makes it is terrible. I would recommend buying the Witcher I or the Witcher II instead. They are similar in way and you will have no problems playing the game. Be sure you do your research before buying this game because there are many issues with it.			",10,0,0,4,0,0,0

												Launched the game the first time, it wants my serial #. No problem, I just copy it over from the Steam overlay and hit ""ok"". Then it wants me to activate it, fine, I hit ""activate online"". Now it wants to know my full name, address, what kind of computer I have... Ridiculous. Why should I have to enter all that info? Isn't it enough that I bought their game from Steam and proved it by entering my serial #? I'm not trading my private information in exchange for playing their game, that's just outrageous			",177,36,4,36,58,0,43

I wish I would have known I would have to give out my personal information to another company just to play a damn video game....... why do they need my address ? why do they need my birthdate? etc etc etc. I will not recommend a game that requires my personal information above what steam already has.

												I had fun playing this game, but it was so buggy and felt very unfinished. It was as if the publisher wanted to get the game out the door, so they cut most of it and released it as a big buggy unfinished mess. I would give this game a 5/10. If there was a side-thumb instead of just a down-thumb, this game would get that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tbh I went into this thinking this game was going to be terrible. Hearing about the 1st was like reading a good horror novel. Many stories all with terrible outcomes and pretty much a constant census....it was a beyond crappy Elder scrolls copy. Naturally with that mass of ""don't do it"" you would think it's sequel wouldn't be that much better....apparently that was incorrect. Everyone said this was a light year jump compared to the last. Never played the 1st so I wouldn't know but I can say whole heartedly this is a good game. Even though I couldn't verify my code to start the game for a day or so (until I learned Norton was blocking stuff), even though this game lagged at the very start at the dungeon section (updated drivers? idk just started running smoothly after that even though the drivers were for hardline optimization...) and even though for some reason I couldn't skip the start up intro a few times....even with all those headaches this game has turned out amazing. Magic system was confusing as fudge but it's pretty sweet, pretty large world, dialogue is quite funny, quests don't seem too mundane and not a single gameplay issue really (aside for a few slow downs a few mintues ago and a brief freeze.) Overall I think this is a very good game.Best way to sum it up would be to compare it to....Saints Row. Two Worlds 2 is the Saints Row to  Skyrims GTA. Pretty sure I didn't world that properly....but what I mean is Two worlds is like Saints Row while Skyrim is GTA. It's not as refined and polished as it's competition and not fully as serious and more cartoony BUT that doesn't mean it doesn't have it's own fun and uniqueness about it.			",81,9,1,15,4,0,4

Product received for free
												I've bought Two Worlds and I ware satisfied with the game, so when I saw it I can grab this one from dlh platform for free I haven't though about it twice.I'm from Poland so you can probably say I'm not fully objective, still I enjoyed this game (played in offline mode), and I'm planning to play it again.People said that the quest system is boring as well as lecturers, but for me this was an enjoyable experience. Also it is said the game has a poor difficulty curve. With that I must agree unfortunately. The start for me was hard, but after I've acquired perks and increased my skill, my bow become deadly almost to everything without serious effort, with the except of the final battle of course, which was way to hard IMHO. This is not Skyrim I must agree, but still this is fine game. The story is ok. Crafting system is improved from first part and it makes far more sense and weapons are no longer ill overpowered. I really enjoyed horse races and I find horses to be far better presented then in Skyrim to be honest.  The 20 dollar tag seems quite much, fortunately this game lands on sales, or giveaways very often and I highly recommend this one.   Btw. watch out for new DLC that is coming out (Call of the Tenebrae). The producer promised that it will improve game graphic significantly with this one.			",115,18,14,27,10,0,23

												Early review and I did not play the first in the series so I am not a ""fanboy"".This game wants to be an Elder Scrolls (fanboy) so bad but just cannot pull it off. This game HAS great  potential and it is sad to see that it has been over looked.AMD GPU USERS. After install restart the machine and it should run fine. Nvidia had their dirty fingers in this and well, enough said.Combat is bad and so are the menu's. Magic is over complicated and very little is explained during game play. At times I did not know what to do or where to go.  Goof around a little and it will come to you.This game needs modders in a bad way. Modders fix what devs just don't get and that is needed here in the worst of ways (like Skyrim did.)I really like the game despite the weakness that is displayed at every possible moment. It just has that feel that I get with the early Elder Scrolls. Perhaps there will be a redux or modders will get involved and make this game great.			",19,2,2,8,0,0,0

												Two Worlds II gets rid of the best part of Two Worlds - exploration. The original game was a rough RPG, it had many flaws, but it was the exploration that made it a decent game. The sequel is no longer open world, and instead it focuses on storyline, which however, is as bad as in the first game. The NPCs are just as shallow, and the combat remains the same - okay, but nothing special. In consequence, we are left with a game that is average at best, because the excitement of discovering new areas is dimnished by the fact that everything is led by the story, and hence the player cannot go sideways, try to fight much more powerful enemies in hope of much better loot than he is supposed to find. Two Worlds II becomes just an average game with nothing special. I would recommend it only for those who already completed Two Worlds and other good RPGs and have nothing to play. It's okay to kill some time, however, not really worth much. Two Worlds II is a huge disappointment. Instead of improving gameplay in the sequel, developers took away the only thing that made the original game good.			",390,117,27,79,52,1,87

												First of all, I played the TW1 on Xbox when it came out. It was one of the best games ever for XB1. Big world, good quests, lots of depth. Some of the UI was not that great but the overall game was good.Then TW2 came out. I played it on XBox again.. ufortunatly not so good. Even less user friendly interface, but fewer options and things to do.No i just got it on PC as my xbox is otherwise ocupied. Im sorry to say that its even worse. You need to type in the serial number for a game on steam.. in the main menu - for the full version of the game - you get adds for other games. Horseriding basically works at random. The horse goes into whatever random direction 30% of the time, which is pretty bad when the mail plot quests include a horse race.The game lags, DX10 support is terrible, the graphics are not aligned and the voiceover does not syn with subtitles. All these things generate a lot of frustraition and force you to spend a lot of extra time to solve stuff because of game mechanics rather than game plot.  Not recomended, go get Oblivion in stead.

												i love this game. i played it all the way through on my ps3 and i'm about halfway through another playthrough with this version. the combat is fairly in depth for what admittedly feels like an unfinished. i'm not complaining in any way-this game's only real downside in my opinion is that there's not much info in-game as to spell crafting or potion making. but that can all be found online. i read some reviews on the store page before i decided to write mine and i noticed several people complaining about the drm. yes-there is one. yes you have to put in a serial number and yes they want a bunch of personal information-but if you're dumb enough to give that up, then you have only yourself to blame. i myself registered this game without any problems and filled in all the blanks with lies. unless you think my first name is really Rabbit and i live on 1234 boner st. seriously though, don't miss out on this great game because of some stupid drm. the graphics aren't perfect, and sometimes the lips don't sync up when they talk, but all in all, this game has dozens of hours of gameplay in single player, and almost as many in the multiplayer campaign (which can be played solo all the way through, but only if you're a badass hahaha)			",229,55,4,55,24,1,35

It might not be as good as The Witcher 2 but same game play type. I say if you like Action RPGs pick this game up and if its on sale (like how i got it :P ) its a 100% buy.Just a fyi there a few glithes and bugs still i seen one Glitch so far but they are easily over looked.So give it a go !!!!

												I could say so many things about how terrible this game is, really, I could. But I think the majority of what's so bad about it can be summarized by the fact that you have physically gallop your horse. No joke. They made it a mini game or something and you have to like, click to a rythym to go anywhere. And if that immediately doesn't say something about the game, the combat system was made by a four year old who just really likes to see your character go flying sword waving straight past your enemy. The idea behind needing to aim each individual swing is fun and interesting but in practice just makes it infuriating and difficult in all the wrong ways. 1/10. I gave it one point because at least the concept behind the game has potential. I wouldn't know because I literally could not even play this game past level 4 or so.			",25,6,0,13,3,0,5

												This game has great graphics and caracters, Unfortunatly the difficulty is WAY to much, I just keep encountering barryer after barryer to gameplay.... This is one of those games where the story cant flow becasue i keep getting stuck and dieding hundreads of times at certain parts. Also you cant delete old saves, so after a while it gets hard to figure out wich one is correct, also the saves appear to have No order to how they are listed, further increasing how much of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥this game is. If you try nd go where the game doesent want you to, you encounter OP mobs that can one shot your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ caracter who, even though he has enough money cannot buy Steel armor because your not a high enough level. This game is full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and although it could be immersive, there is nothing immersive about dieing 20 times to get through a gate guarded by 6 wolfmen, or pausing it to guzzle health potions, and then running out and dieing anyway...  And although it says its ""OPEN WORLD"" it might as well not be, casue this game is full of narrow passes you have to go through. making it feel Not open in any way. Also Horses are compleatly useless, they are slower then running on foot. For some reason my caracter can run 60MPH even carrying armor and a big shield. My caracter looks like a teenager but sounds like batman in the dark knight movie... THis game basicly sucks. Im tired of having to go outsde the game to look up how other people got through this♥♥♥♥♥♥... even on easy this is still the hardest RPG ive ever played.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												 Two Worlds 2 is a game that is pretty much unfinished. How do I know? The map, the story, the map. I first played the original Two Worlds back in 07. The game was strange to sat the least. The story felt unfinished with entire cities not even used within the story. There was a lack of polish but it did feel like an journey, as well as offered some new things for it's time. Now the 2nd one. Eh...  So at first it seems more polished. The story feels more a part of the game world and not just an after thought. The story is still weak. Your character has to save his sister again, while getting transported to different areas for whatever reason. The story also starts and ends all of the sudden.   Gameplay wise it is a third person hack n slash. Nothing wrong, nothing good either. The boats are nice but needless due to the world mostly being shut off from you openly exploring. Horses are also lame since you only use them on smallish islands.  Sound is ehh. Voice actors try, but their tones don't fit their scenes. Think Oblivion with even less feeling. Graphics are decent for 2011, not on par with Witcher 2 but also no where near as demanding. I play this game at Ultra except AA @2160p 60fps no dips on a 4790k/980ti. The performance is great. Visual options are fairly vast and some advanced setting as well.  The game world is dull and much smaller than the first game. You have a semi large island and two smaller islands. There is a huge hunk of land in the middle of the map but you can not get on it. Atleast not center of it. It is reserved for multiplayer. What a load. You can sail around for hours in a boat, that if you get it stuck on rocks you're stuck. This a mostly empty world.  Atleast they got rid of the old english from the last game. All in all this is a skipable boring RPG. Get Witcher 3, Skyrim, or beer instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a gigantic 3rd person rpg. It has 100s of quets across large continents with various enemies, skill system and a deep crafting and magic system. There are 100s of hours of gameplay here... However it has many many problems. The pathing is awful, the AI trivial, and the balance completely out of whack. The plot  is awful and none of the characters you meet are any fun, I would recommend people just to play it for the story on easy mode and then just uninstall this game when you are done. 6.5/10			",236,129,2,30,12,0,37

												This game have 90% of those feature that i want to see in classic RPG. It's:- Big world.- Interesting dialogues.- Lot of fun.- Unique crafting system.- Skill learning system.- Good music.- Co-op option.and etc.Story is simple, but close to final it can surprise you. DLC seems small, but after first half of game, it giving you large space for adventure. Unfortunately, sometimes balance is bad, Biggest island have ""fences"" and you can't explore everything. Hope there will be Two worlds III sometime. Bigger, better, back to mainland.			",159,3,1,8,3,0,12

												While the game play is a nice upgrade from the last game, and the extra stuff you can do in the game is cool, what got me the most is activating the game.NOT! that it was hard but this is one of those games that says your guilty right off the bat auto assumeing you pirated the game. NOT ONLY did they ask for an activation code but you have to give them all your information before playing the game. Such as a street adress, your phone number, email, full name, AND then you had to do an email varification AGAIN NOT that this was hard but the idea of it puts a bad taste in the mouth.

												There's something about this game I've always liked. Note that I also own it on console and have played 50+ hours. The graphics are good (for when it came out) and the animations are as well. I would call it a ""hardcore"" RPG and I think thats what throws people off. It's very much for RPG fans and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else really.. but if you are one that I say you should give it a try. Altough it's fairly dead, the multiplayer is also very fun.

												*Note: I do not *not* reccomend it, but instead I cannot say it's most enjoyable. Due to Steam lacking a neutrual option, despite much ask for it, I mean lean towards this part of the black and white system it has.Review start:The game is, sadly, not as good as the first. It has a good idea for a system, but doesn't do to well. It heavily reminds me of the first Assassins Creed, with the graphics and how running works. Sadly though it doesn't have the good features of it.The combat has changed, and now defensive combat isn't the same, but instead an actual blocking mechanic. The downside is that it doesn't actually block but reduce damage. The magic system and bows have changed for the better, though meele is now worse.When it comes to meele, there is no longer a dodge back mechanic. The block system was instead put in as a replacement, but it fails because like before, it only reduces damage without the overpowered benifits. The idea was good though, and I'd like to see a more realistic version of it in the next game. If it was more so fast-paced realistic combat compared to full on fantasy I think the combat system would be amazing, and work more with the design it has.It still suffers from the RPG sickness most games have, where you are forced to upgrade gear all the time or die. That is annoying for the fact it restricts how much you can customize yourself.Early game it is hard, and unclear why so to many people. Some enemies can be defeated, others cannot with no indication. It doesn't help that your also very weak at the start.One annoying thing that caused me to like the game less is how, right now, to advance in the story I must travel on road, yet the dog people (Forgot the name) are placed right where I must go. It wouldn;t be bad, if i could actually attack them. Not only do their shamans have a cloak that kills me faster then I can attack, but shooting them is useless as they heal faster then you can damage. There is also no limit to their mana for some reason.The inventory is screwed up, or at least the keybindings are now, as it's akward to reach over to F1-7 all the time and memorize it. The old inventory was fine, as items were easy to spot and everything was neat and organized I would say.This is all I have to say for now, and it may change as I play some more, but for now it's a netural leaning towards a sale price. Also if Steam ever adds an actual netural option, as people want, I'll fix the review.			",51,5,0,10,1,1,1

												An improvement over the first one, worth checking out. The biggest problem this game has is the combat system. It all comes down to just spamming LMB and one or two skills. Worse than that is when you're trying to hit something right in front of you and you either don't hit the enemy at all or swing your weapon at their side or something, it's weird and messy sometimes.Also, the protagonist has some really poor dialogue in my opinion.

												When this game was released, a friend and I played it but exclusively for the co-op adventure so we could be together. I can't think of a greater injustice. The games Multiplayer \ co-op features are merely a glimpse into what this game has to offer. After years I've thankfully come back to play it, and the single-player RPG is absolutely fantastic. From the markets of Hatmandor, across the archipelago in my own sailboat to the University at Ashos; I love this game. Multiplayer is fun, co-op is great; but single-player is where this game really shines. The graphics hold up tremendously, the music is wonderful, and while some of the voice-acting isn't top-notch; it's light years beyond the first Two Worlds game. I absolutely recommend playing through this campaign. Any RPG fan will adore it.			",328,68,15,116,146,1,141

												Two Worlds 2 можно порекомендовать в качестве реабилитационной терапии после недавней Готики. Она на самом деле лучше, прилизаннее, лишена чудовищных багов. Для многих она подействовала действительно как бальзам на душу. К несчастью, при всем старании разработчиков убрать недостатки предыдущей части новые «элементы» резво бьют по рукам, отбивая желание знакомства с этим безумно неудобным шаблонным миром. Спасти ситуацию мог мультиплеер, однако он заведомо обречен на провал. Сервера пустуют. Мультиплеер первой части являлся настоящим пристанищем лагов и читеров, и, несмотря на все заверения, Two Worlds 2 унаследовала все эти черты. Чего стоит только тот факт, что статы игроков хранятся на локальных компьютерах. Несложно представить последствия этой ситуации. Все, что есть в Two Worlds 2 – прилизанное визуальное оформление и отсутствие багов. Последнее на сегодняшний день – настоящая редкость, так что этот факт может являться стимулом для прохождения игры до конца, в том случае если закрыть глаза на неадекватный интерфейс и пустые диалоги. RealityPump «перестарались» – других слов для подведения итога попросту не найти.			",239,23,13,10,9,3,27

I'm gonna leave it as Recommend because it's still a good game, may change if this cutscene deal stays as a permament block...Update: Okay found a fix online, there's a default setting ""HD Video"" set it to off or cutscenes will fail...

												Holy s**t this is a terrible game.  Lets start off with the beginning.  Why does a game want my name, address, birthdate, and gender?  Blatant refusal to give out all that for a game, so I now live at 69 Nope Rope Avenue.  Secondly is the immersion.  Granted, I had read the reviews before purchasing so I was prepared for a dud, but this is aweful.  You can never go wrong with the cudgel.  You don't even have to hit them and they'll take damage.  When a spell or arrow hits, the sounds and animations are off enough to make you wonder if you actually hit the targets or not.  As for aiming, with magic there's no need.  Just spin around until the purple circle highlights an enemy and fire away, through your body if need be.  Voice acting is meh, but that they tried to animate the lips and bodies to match, but missed the mark entirely is just irritating.  At this point a text dialogue would have been better.Third is the story, or how much I could get through without contemplating burning my PC just for some entertainment.  It's dull and lifeless.  Somebody got kidnapped, and somebody wants you to save them, and you're important but we can't say why, of and I can see the future so trust me.  Might not have been so bad, but the story never ends.  Run from one room to another, and you'll get stopped by some triggered story time.  I barely get to kill two enemies before it's time to listen to someone else ramble on about something that ultimately devolves into fetch and kill quests.So why did I buy this game?  The magic creation system.  I was told it was advanced, and from the gameplay videos it interested me enough to drop $20 (with a coming refund).  Let me tell you know, it sucks.  You first need to unlock skills by finding items, and then you need to find items to craft the skills, and then you need to spend resources to cast the skills.  Maybe if in the first hour you got more than two spells, it could be enough to draw you in, but nope.  Here's a game that lets you craft anything, kind of, with limited variability.So no, don't buy this thing.			",59,10,0,10,17,0,12

												Two Worlds 2 можно порекомендовать в качестве реабилитационной терапии после недавней Готики. Она на самом деле лучше, прилизаннее, лишена чудовищных багов. Для многих она подействовала действительно как бальзам на душу. К несчастью, при всем старании разработчиков убрать недостатки предыдущей части новые «элементы» резво бьют по рукам, отбивая желание знакомства с этим безумно неудобным шаблонным миром. Спасти ситуацию мог мультиплеер, однако он заведомо обречен на провал. Сервера пустуют. Мультиплеер первой части являлся настоящим пристанищем лагов и читеров, и, несмотря на все заверения, Two Worlds 2 унаследовала все эти черты. Чего стоит только тот факт, что статы игроков хранятся на локальных компьютерах. Несложно представить последствия этой ситуации. Все, что есть в Two Worlds 2 – прилизанное визуальное оформление и отсутствие багов. Последнее на сегодняшний день – настоящая редкость, так что этот факт может являться стимулом для прохождения игры до конца, в том случае если закрыть глаза на неадекватный интерфейс и пустые диалоги. RealityPump «перестарались» – других слов для подведения итога попросту не найти.			",239,23,13,10,9,3,27

												When this game was released, a friend and I played it but exclusively for the co-op adventure so we could be together. I can't think of a greater injustice. The games Multiplayer \ co-op features are merely a glimpse into what this game has to offer. After years I've thankfully come back to play it, and the single-player RPG is absolutely fantastic. From the markets of Hatmandor, across the archipelago in my own sailboat to the University at Ashos; I love this game. Multiplayer is fun, co-op is great; but single-player is where this game really shines. The graphics hold up tremendously, the music is wonderful, and while some of the voice-acting isn't top-notch; it's light years beyond the first Two Worlds game. I absolutely recommend playing through this campaign. Any RPG fan will adore it.			",328,68,15,116,146,1,141

												+ Reworked combat places emphasis on action over animation. Deeper magic system+ Good quest variety+ Music is still great, voice acting is improved+ Lots of minigames that adhere to the experience~ Armor and weapons can no longer be upgraded endlessly~ Alchemy no longer has any negative effects. Once you can make a good channeling potion, you'll forget what dying was like~ Texture quality is improved, but everything else looks awkward. There is way too much bloom and motion blur~ Horse control is improved, but mounted combat is gone. Enemies can now be run over~ Quests now use automatic map markers to show the way. Though it's nice to see where I have to go, I found myself rarely having to actually think to complete quests. It's an imperfect solution that could have been solved through better writing- Game is short and linear. Main quest must now be done in specific order. 4 chapters, and the last 2 can be done in about an hour each. Game tries to cover this up by having a steep difficulty curve. It makes sidequests feel compulsory, as this is where most xp can be found. Boosting your level this way is the only way to make the main quest a fair challenge- Map is much more limited than it looks. Large amounts of land and sea have little of interest and/or are inaccesible. A lot of the time that I've logged on the game has been simply to explore areas that I later found were pointless to explore- Stupid AI. Got a bounty for defending myself in a city. Many enemies can be safespotted- Lots of glitches. That bounty I just mentioned; I got it for fighting back against a character who was supposed to stop asking me for money after a quest. Quest ended, and whenever I got too close to him, I had to choose whether to pay him or fight himOverall, it's sort of ""meh"". Drops the ball on a lot of the stuff that the first game did fine, while introducing mechanics that feel fresh and more user-friendly. Not sure whether I recommend it, unless you also plan on getting the DLC, in which case it's definitely worth a try.			",120,19,3,24,14,0,4

												I wanted my money back 20 minutes into the game. The only thing salvagable i got from the bundle package was the tower defense. I think the trailer made it look much more glamerous and made it out to be much more than it really is. The gameplay looked good, but there was no option to setup a controller. Also I do not like the multiplayer. One thing in particular was haveing to bring up a menu to leave the city gates. Another was the life regeneration skill only worked if you wasn't in fighting stance. I could understand haveing to change stances if the fighting stance had an ill affect on friendly NPC's, could accindently perform an attack on one, or change the attitude of a potential enemy. In my opinion they had good intentions, but the game lack a sort of uniqueness that draws a player in.			",16,2,0,6,5,0,11

IT is not even like Dark souls ng6. IT is just plain ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to the point where i threw my hands in the air and said ♥♥♥♥ it.You cant be a mage because the monster one hit you so you are forced in a mellee combat where you just wait for opponet to open up and then dodge 5 metters away when you swing. And even the lames monsters come at you before you even get their hp to 50% with any offensive spell.  I spent 10 bucks on the game and still feel cheated.			",23,4,0,4,1,0,5

												character movement seems stiff and combat doesn't feel smooth.  The backgrounds are pretty and the story seems interesting, but you need to sign up for and run uplay to play this game which I hate.  You should not need to download a non-related game retailer and info sniffer to play a game.  You can't tell me that two worlds needs uplay in any way.It took more time to set up, sign up, sign in, punch in codes, and update than I played at all.Full disclosure:  I didn't play this game for long because it started out leaving a bad taste in my mouth.Save your money for skyrim or pacman or anything else.

IT is not even like Dark souls ng6. IT is just plain ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to the point where i threw my hands in the air and said ♥♥♥♥ it.You cant be a mage because the monster one hit you so you are forced in a mellee combat where you just wait for opponet to open up and then dodge 5 metters away when you swing. And even the lames monsters come at you before you even get their hp to 50% with any offensive spell.  I spent 10 bucks on the game and still feel cheated.			",23,4,0,4,1,0,5

												This was a very solid RPG with tons of great gameplay and at a discounted price it's a fantastic buy. The last part of the game isn't as filled out as the rest of the game, but that seems to be a design issue as much as anything else. As with most RPGs, the real joy of the game is getting there. The magic system is original and flexible (possibly to the point of being overpowered), bow and standard combat is decent but not groundbreaking.  I really enjoyed a lot of the characterization. The horses are a bit of a disappointment, but you really only have to use it for one part. The free expansion is even kinda fun, though I wished it was harder and longer. Thats what she said.

												A fun experience. While the game isn't perfect, it has some great qualities that seperate it from other single player role playing games. I thought that the mechanics worked well, especially the crafting systems, whether for the magic or melee weapons. The story is somewhat cliche, but does not detract from the way the game plays. The combat is fluid and fun. Only gripe I personally had with it was storing my items in the starting area which will be unable to be entered by the end of the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Two Worlds II seems interesting... if only it worked! After wrestling with intrusive DRM, I couldn't get my gamepad to do anything useful (since the mouse stops moving when the gamepad is connected and neither the keyboard nor gamepad can use the menu). For a game that's marked with ""controller support"" this is pretty poor. The controls seem a little laggy as well... I hope I can experience this game one day, but for now, this has been money wasted. Please fix controls!			",18,5,0,10,3,0,9

THEN YOU NEED TO WRITE THE FAX,YOUR PHONE NUMBER,YOUR ADRESS,YOUR NAME, JUST TO PLAY THE GAME. or you know just play the demo that is put in there just so you can try out this game. I didnt bother with the activation stuff so i just tried out the demo. Made my character midged pumpkin and started the game. the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥camera angle is ♥♥♥♥ed up. Its not above you,its not behind you,its to the right. And you cant change it. Combat system sucks and i only played 20 minutes of this♥♥♥♥♥♥ I reccomend you not buying this game if you are planning on to. Or if you like these kinda games you do you boo boo.

												So, a little bit more and the game asks me when was the last time I had sex in order to activate the ♥♥♥♥ing game. The DRM is a joke, they've lost more customers because of it than anything. So I ended up just playing in Demo mode, which doesn't have some extra content aparantly. Honestly I will not fill a ♥♥♥♥ing long form to just to get some extra stuff. And the game doesn't encourage me to do it either, since everytime I started the game it allways asked me to do the activation from the beggining, instead of just letting me continue where I had left of.what the ♥♥♥♥. Greed is the name you call to this kind of DRM.			",45,10,0,14,4,0,4

												I'm going to be blunt here. The multiplayer CAN be fun, with friends of course, if you can look past the ""dark"" story, and forget about what you are supposedly questing for, having some friends in this can make it much more enjoyable, its loot system is intresting, and magic can get crazy with enough planning. Another positive point is the crafting system, you can keep improving stuff you like for a good while until you reach an actual upgrade, and as stated before, friends make it fun.Grab it when it's cheap, 10 bucks is too much, but 5 dollars seems alright for a fun game with friends.Single player hurts to play through, but is tolerable. Though I wouldn't reccomend playing through it, its a standard ""dark and brooding hero"" storyline with rebel mumbo-jumbo.			",104,16,4,12,6,2,4

												Well, I'll say I was skeptical when I bought this game as a lot of people were knocking it but honestly I'm enjoying it quite a lot! It is a tad bit buggy fighting in tight places, and somewhat frustrating starting out but once you advance a little and get your stats up it is fun despite what people say. Just don't buy it expecting Skyrim and you won't be dissapointed lol. I'm enjoying the lively soundtrack, the voice acting is over all pretty good and for the most part the landscapes and visuals in general are great for the age of the game. The story line...well it gets you from one quest to the next, it is very much open world so you can wander as you please...however you can easily find youself severely out matched by wandering off the questline too soon. The controller support is a welcome addition as well (and yes keyboard commando types I am aware of your preferances... that works well also) when you have been mouse and keyboard gaming for over 30 years like myself trust me your wrists appriciate the change in position. If you do prefer the keyboard with your young healthy wrists :P then make sure to unplug any gamepads you may have as it defaults to controller without the option to switch if it detects a gamepad. So yeah...I'm running it in Windows 10 Anniversary with a mid range setup and it works flawlessly for me without any tweaking, so far no crashing or glitches. There is a somewhat annoying banner ad for the dlc's on the main page, but nothing of the sort in gameplay. People complain about the registration process...yeah...there is a checkbox to uncheck to skip this... if you just read lol. You do have to activate it...which is different.			",4,0,0,7,0,0,0

												Huge map, mediocre graphics, a decent battle system, a few bugs here and there, and extremely cheesy dialogue from a hero who just doesn't shut up.Despite that, it is a decent open world RPG if you are looking for one to kill time. Don't expect Skyrim with this in terms of lore, dialogue, and enviroment. One of the biggest and best things about this game is it's magic system, which gives you a huge amount of customization that a lot of other RPG's can take a lesson from.			",116,12,1,15,8,0,3

												I think this was an improvement from the first game of the series. However, that doesn't mean this game is particularly good. The main character is still voiced awfully, but as a whole, the voice acting in this game is sooo much better than Two Worlds 1. But, the movement in this game is so unrealistic and loose. Controls are unnecessarily stupid too. To sprint you have to hold down RMB? Dafuq? The whole interface isn't very user friendly (in my opinion) either. I feel like if they got movement and controls better in this game, it would be so much better. But nah. I'd still recommend it though, as it is quite a fun RPG once you get used to it.

												I seriously can't understand the hate, this game is a gem!Well, I've already played Two Worlds II years ago in the retail edition. I thought a lot of times about getting it on steam, but hesitated, bc of bad reviews (mostly the DRM). Downloaded > installed > did not run, but found that just Nvidia physX (located in the game folder) needs to be installed > started, made a very simple registration > the game runs perfectly, and still feels like in the old days!What is so great about this game? It is very creative, you have a crafting/weapon upgrading system, cool alchemy and witchcraft system, so it is not like a mainstream RPG. It has got it's flaws, no question, but there is one big thing: THIS GAME HAS A SOUL, IT FEELS ALIVE! And that's something I was missing in the TES games, which appear to be a lot more static compared to this one. Maybe not in the first prologue part, but after you start on the first island, you wanna get lost in this game just to find yourself after hours, wondering what time it is and when your birthday is. So many things to discover, and it makes even fun to read the books you find.Give it a try and thank me later!			",167,27,1,25,8,0,27

												I played the crap out of this game when it first came out, but only the multiplayer part. That alone is worth the 20 bucks as you can easily get 40 hours out of it. The spell system is so absolutely fantastic, it makes you wonder why you would play any other class. Probably spent 10+ hours building random spells just to see how they work. If only they had made the campaign multiplayer, this game would probably be one of the biggest hits ever.The single player game, for what little I played, was fun, and had a similar feel as the elderscrolls games. One thing I disliked, but came to appreciate for the level of detail, was getting hassled by guards for bumping into people on the street. Worth a play through if you are looking for a good solo fantasy game.			",212,10,0,44,11,0,14

But the story is great, the voice acting is extremely well done. And all in all if you can get yourself to ignore the bugs this is acctually a great game. The crafting system is very simple and easy to learn. Combat is quick and to the point once you get used to it. There is alot of gear and loot in the world, and enemies generally drop decent loot. I do reccomend this game, but only to people that can look past its unfinished and flawed cover, and find the game beneath all the bugs.			",219,16,8,32,32,0,27

												TL;DR: Played this game a while ago when it came out for Xbox 360.  I enjoyed it greatly until the game had some very poor performance and became unplayable.  The PC version works a lot better and is well worth the sale price.Rest of review:This game is poorly optimized, similar to The Witcher 2, with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ framerates in environments that look rather simple.  The performance issues aside, the game isn't gorgeous and offers little visual stimulation in return for your hours of progression.  The said, if you have a decent enough computer to run the game at a smooth 60fps, I imagine it'll be a fun game to toy with.The magic system is interesting.  You collect and combine cards to create magical skills to be used in the open world.  Don't misunderstand: this isn't a card game.  You simply use the cards to make stuff.  It's done fairly well and offers a lot of customization to your magical arsenal.The open world is fairly big but not as freely roamed as Skyrim or Fallout New Vegas.   There are a lot of linear, story-driven missions which get in the way of your exploratory experience.  However, you can explore a lot of areas in this game, and often, you are rewarded with both loot and side quests.Update - Dec. 2014: This game is now only $1.99, so get it.  Yes, it was in a few bundles recently, and that's probably part of why the game became so cheap on Steam.  The game is open world and offers a lot of exploration, but the game's performance is rather cumbersome to say the least.  If you have a decent enough machine for it, it's a decent enough experience to be worth the two dollars at least.			",571,115,13,72,58,7,60

												Awsome game overall, great spell system I loved the way you make your own spells, extremely creative and revolutionary. Combat system is not bad could use a little work. Story pretty good except you get virtually no choice in the extremely linear adventure. World is HUGE feels HUGE but the teleportation system makes it managable.Last Boss SUXED MY LEFT NUT enjoyed 99% of game to get to the last boss and WTF was the point of leveling my char. TOTAL WASTE OF MY TIME. MY ♥♥♥♥ING LVL 1 CHAR can kill the last boss by manning the ballistas and shooting her.Ending can SUCK my RIGHT NUT. Weak as hell.			",129,22,0,49,6,0,71

												This game is what the original tried to be, but fell short of. Two worlds two fixs all the issues I had with the first game without losing its charm. The combat is clean and fluid, the customisation is vast. The spell building is exciting. The story is deep and interesting. And the multyplayer mode is fun, though often empty. Grab a friend if you intend to play, dont expect many pubs. All in all great game. Would give it a solid 8/10Highly recommended.			",77,11,2,41,12,1,9

												While the combat is clunky to say the least, once you start finding books to unlock more spell types and abilities, the game becomes far more interesting. Combine this with a fairly basic crafting system and you have a decent RPG. I will say this though, there are several bugs that have burrowed their way into this game, whether it is ground polygons having flipped normals causing you to drop into an endless sea, accidentally getting stuck inside of a boulder inside a cave and having to re-load or having enemies getting stuck inside the environment. All and all, 6/10 here. It would get a 7/10 but the dialog is painfully bad at times and it completely takes me out of the experience.			",14,1,3,2,1,0,0

												Two worlds (the first game) had a huge map, yet it felt janky in every way a game can feel janky. Two worlds 2, has a tiny map, tiny islands, and for a game with guilds and a supposedly open world, does not have a great deal to discover. So in the end, both games have drawbacks. If you want a huge world, get the first game, just be willing to overlook 1000 different janky elements. If you want a more console, streamlined, slimmed down, rpg time, get this game. It looks better, plays better, and the content while significantly reduced, is of a higher quality level. 7.5/10 for the core game, 7/10 for the expansion which has better writing but a smaller world and a desaturated look that feels a bit washed out and unexiting visually. If you want a skyrim extremely-lite experiance, then you might find that here and have a damn good time.			",706,159,22,115,53,2,124

The so called registration process is just for some silly DLC. just click cancel and you are right in the middle of the main menue.And for the rest of the game: it is what i missed in Skyrim. With Oblivion you can create spells, enchant items and so on... skirim abandoned that feature or simplified it to far. For good or bad is you to decide. But i missed it.Games like Gothic, Witcher, TES are rare enough and TW II is a gem. The Story is good, grafics are nice too. But where this game stands out is the spell creation system. Want anvils to rain down on your opponents and then use the anvils as a shield floating around you? become invisible and heal yourself in combat? That's just fine with the game. Your imagination (and of course some game balancing) is the limit.As i am typing, it is priced below 5 $/€ . So what?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There is lots to love here for fans of the sandboxy-RPG realm, I suppose. I'm no authority on the genre, but the combat and magic system, for example, actually offers a superior level of fun in some ways than that of titans like Skyrim, IMHO.The musical 'mini-game' deserves a paragraph unto itself. It's Medieval Guitar Hero, with song arrangements that are actually quite inspired and a surprising joy to dabble in with the various bards-at-large in the realm.But at the end of the day, TWII seems kind of hamstrung by flat voice acting, repetitive sound design, and a maddeningly middle-of-the-road stance on how seriously it wants to be taken.At times this tongue-in-cheek, knowing stance works in the game's — and the gamer's — favour, giving it a disarmingly approachable feel for an 'epic' RPG. At other moments, however, you may find yourself desperately wishing it could make up its mind to stop pulling punches and fully embrace one way or the other.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game especially if you can find it on sale.  Not as polished as the Elder Scroll series, but if you can look past the terrible voice acting , spelling and clunky UI it really isn't a bad game at all.  Beautiful landscapes, fun magic system, a LOT of quests.  Takes a pretty decent computer to run well at the higher settings.  Definitely a game that will keep me well entertained until Skyrim releases.			",195,24,5,30,23,0,16

												This game is amazing, however recently have been losing all of my process after multiplayer missions. The last three times was in a multiplay map and compleated a campan (between 2-4 hr), the game didn't save and lost all progress and items.Game play is amazing, controls and process tree is great. Enjoy the co-op element. Enjoy the village feature (like sim city). With the saving error, it makes the game annoying. 4hr is alot of time for me to put into a game. To lose all progress is hurtful, three times is heel palm to the face. What is worse is that the people in the mission kept their progress and now I'm behind.I stil l ike playing this game, and it seems like I'm the only one with this error from my friends, so I'm assuming it has to be something wrong with my PC.

												Fairly solid game with some missed potential. More customization options would have been nice, you can only be a human male and even then you have no options for things like tatoos and scars, and all the hair/beards look the same.-Melee combat can seem very clunky until you get the hang of it, also PAY ATTENTION TO ENEMY DAMAGE RESISTS. A basic skeleton will kick your♥♥♥♥♥with ease if you attempt to fight it with a bladed weapon.-Horse riding is annoying as well and i find myself preferring to leg it the whole way instead.-Graphics are excellent, i cannot play it on full detail and it still blows even modded skyrim out of the water in that respect.-World size is huge, while much of it is water there is still probably 2-3X the land area of skyrim.-Crafting/upgrading is conveneint and useful, and the lockpick minigame is less of a chore than many others I've Oblivio.. I mean encountered.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is my first review ever because Im lazy but I just had to write a review for this game because its so great.If your reading this I know what your thinking, should I really buy this game? The answer is hell yes.Im not gonna lie when it comes to the single player mode I only played about 5 minutes of it and I was disgusted with how awful it was lol. But the multiplayer omg so great.The crafting of armor and crystals, and spells omg the possibilities of creation in this game is amazing. Everyone in multiplayer starts in a lobby town with shops and from there you pick missions, duels, ect. Its a great place to meet other players. If you enjoy variety and sklled combat this multiplayer experience is for you. Currently I'm rocking a Necromancer/poison mage and loving it. Its not a balanced system due to the almost limitless possbily of magic creation, yes you can make your own spells. That doesnt mean melee sucks, far from it. This game goes on sale all the time btw and is still very much alive, look for me LordRed Ill help you out online, unless your half dwarf....ew. !!!Very important!!! Just FYI the community is complete crap, no one responds to your questions or even respond at all. They either ignore you or don't speak english. The admins are most likely power tripping children also so be cautious with what you say and don't use all caps because they ban...I know completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The game has sexual references, curse words, and they told me to change my name ""LordBalls"" or else I'd get banned...you've been warned.			",36,4,0,8,3,0,5

												Yes, yes, a great RPG. Becomes easier addictive.Since I installed it, I cannot stop playing it and immerse in a great story.Buy it, since Valve makes great discounts on it on sales !It's pretty like The Witcher with great quests and adventures.			",73,12,4,9,2,0,8

												Two Worlds, truly a worthy of your time, many of you will of course not know this game, because this game is very underrated. Two Worlds is a game like no other, the single player compaign is exciting as it is twisted, the combat system is certainly better than the elder scroll series, although the voice acting needs a lot of work. Aside from this, multiplayer compaign offers an experience like no other, not a lot of people log on now, but there still some faithful ones who are really friendly and nice people.

												A massive game! An awesome - and still active multiplayer mode, an incredible single player mode with a super odd story, one of the best spell casting systems I've ever seen in a game adds variety to gameplay. It has some nice polish on it throughout.This title almost puts vanilla Skyrim to shame. Almost. If Skyrim were standard in 3rd person, they'd be synonomous. The few issues people may have with this title are nit picking compared to what this title does well. Which is a lot if you enjoy a solid adventure/RPG.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Polish version of Oblivion (IMO better than Oblivion) along with some interesting mini-games like the instruments. Combat is however a little clunky and can get awkwards at times. Aside from that however it is still fun. The biggest downsides to the game are the bugs and glitches, which might require you to cheat or to reload from previous saves. Get the worldmerge mod to merge the flying pirates dlc into the main campaign; along with the other adventure maps in the multiplayer.			",78,15,0,20,16,0,18

												I couldn't seem to get into the melee, marksman, assassin combat system.  Blah! I hated it!  The mage combat system is great.  That's my style right there!  I really love how in depth the character build is.  The spell system has cards you combined so customization of spells becomes another HUGE PLUS for being a mage.   The acting isn't the best but it's good enough to enjoy.  The best thing of this game is EYE CANDY!  It's beautiful and virbraint. IMO the graphics are better than skyrim but the combat system isn't up to par.  TIME CONSUMING GAME!			",139,21,0,40,10,0,6

												I'm a huge fan of this genre of game, love Skyrim, Witcher etc and this game, though not quite in thier league certainly is worth a playthrough.Two Worlds has decent graphics, a good storyline, from what I've ssen so far and has some nice touches with craftable equipment and spells. It does suffer a little from clunky combat, but not in a major way and certainly not a game breaker.All in all a thumbs up, especially when you get it on a  sale.			",47,4,0,35,2,0,15

												I remember my first time playing this game. I was awestruck by the graphics and way the weapon system worked. The single player campaign offers a really intresting insight towards a great story that teachs you the basic concept of how attacks work (including how to make your own spells). Later on you may find yourself seeking to play with other players in the multi-player world. I could tell you that in the past, the town was lively with many players seeking lobby games and teaming up with new players. Sadly their are few players left who play in this multiplayer world as they look towards new video games being released. All in all, if your looking for a good campaign game to fight in then I would recommend this one but if your looking for a multiplayer experiance then you might end up being lucky if you find a few players or unlucky if you don't.

												I would give this game a 6/10.The story...very enjoyable and entertaining side quests let you meet some very colorful characters.The Graphics...it is a bit buggy at times, but makes up for that in great scenery and wildlife graphics. I wish they had done as well with the human graphics, they are not horrible but could have been so much better. The water graphics... WOW the best I have seen in a game!The Fighting system...great balance of attack, parry, and defence that makes you think and time your moves for the best outcome. Very enjoyable!The Quest system...very in depth with clues along the way and map marks to help get you where you need to go.The Transportation...boats...horses...teleports...what else does one need? :)The Magic system...fun but complicated. You can create your own spell combinations using 'cards' that you find while exploring, hunting, and buying from merchants. It makes for some fun effects if you have invested in the skill far enough to cast what you have created.The Alchemy system...fun to experiment and make your own recipes that you can save and click a scroll to create later with ease. Water walking potion? Squee!The Crafting system...on the fly and anywhere crafting! Dismantle what you don't need for components and use them to upgrade the stuff you are going to use! And don't forget the dyes...what color do you want to wear? Find dyes at merchants and use them to our hearts delight!Overall I really enjoyed this game...though it is no Gothic, Dragon Age or Skyrim...it was still fun!Mods...I would recommend the Two Worlds Merged, mod. It expands the World into one large map with no barriers, adds more dye options, an in depth add on series of quests that are quite fun and add hours of gameplay...and many other features that add to the fun!

												Welll, for the age of the game and everything it plays really great so far, im only dissapointed that I just bought the game for 4 tf2 keys(roughly 10 bucks) now its on sale for 3.99$. , still worth what I paid though., magic is very over powered but you have the power to create your own spells, duration, homing missle, aoe. magic type and everything makes it  fun.  with every game you are going to have pro's and con's. if you like 3rd person rpg, you will like this game.

												Solid Action-RPG. Havn`t played this genre since skyrim and it`s fun again - i will continue. Graphics/textures are very nice, animations not really. Arms and legs are looking weird sometimes, but the nature and buildings are really awesome.The controls are easy/intuitive as soon as you change the keybindings, same with fighting. Melee is easy-mode, you just have to aim when you use a bow or some spells. So it´s more button-mashing and the choice how you like to kill. There`s also the possibility to sneak around and assassinate. Story is the same bla bla as in every RPG. Star Wars and Lord of the rings in a mixer - something like that - but i don`t care anyway.For 5€ definately worth a buy.			",66,3,0,10,6,2,13

With this sale, I read some reviews and read opinions on the PC version, which makes it to be a much better version than the console versions, I took the bait.Long story short, this is a MUCH MUCH improved game over the first one.

Die Story ist leider der übliche Fantasy Einheitsbrei mit ein paar Plot Twists. Im allgemeinen hat mich Two Worlds 2 jedoch sehr positiv überrascht. 8,7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Positives:-Fun and interesting open world with a good story line to say the least. -Extremely unique and original NPC's.-There are a TON of quests to do. I absolutely loved the first two worlds when i played it on the xbox. I literally played my mega high level character that one hit everything so much that the game corrupted, and yes it was buggy and i could go on forever about the bad aspects. -Two worlds 2 to me is a lot more appealing visually and im glad it didnt slack in anything because of it.-overall customization from the first two worlds to the second is still there. -Also the skill tree is identical. (I'd hope to see new skills if another is made)-Is the game is replayable? Very much so. All the time I find a badass staff or legendary crossbow and im on my warrior, or vice versa, and it really makes me want to try to get a similar item that would match my character. you just need to try every hero build and experiment.-Dismantling, Crafting, upgrading, and socketing items is great.-Alchemy is sometimes useful.-Magic system is also very unique and experimental.-I always love third person games but im pretty sure the first could be first person and third, it's been years since i played the first game.And here we go...Negatives:Honestly I'm not trying to polish poop here, the game is well rounded and playable but there's a lot of downsides.-Don't even get my started on horseback riding... -Still the same annoying voice of the character talking to themself, like oh ""what's this?"" upon finding an item. Characters say ""did you miss me"" when they run into enemies... ( it rains and he says ""just what I needed"") sometimes jumping in water they say "" ooh atleast it's not cold."" and then other times they say the water is cold etc. I love the game but damn it's just dumb hahaha.-I don't really care for the archery in this game its not satisfying to me.-Sometimes it's EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING if quests dont give enough information and you have to run around in an open world for literally an hour sometimes with no direction to try to find what you're looking for by constantly checking your map and equipment hoping for a clue as to where to go.(DLC especially) There's so many islands and often if you don't make good progress you'd never finish the game due to the lack of guidance.-When I play with direct x10 for me it's unplayable there's a lot of bugs.p.s.all right, so there's more negatives obviously like annoying ai's hand gestures repeatedly but thats kinda picky. Ofcourse you're all subject to your own opinion and right now I may be leaving out positives or negatives but i would not pay full price for this game. face the fact that it's not a perfect game but it has original and exciting aspects to it.DO-Watch some youtube clips to see if you'd like it first.-Buy this game if you get a chance to snatch it for 5 bucks or less.-Build epic heroes and experiment with game mechanics.-rate up my review if this was helpful at all. I really do love this game but actually thinking through it and putting down the negatives can only better the cause for future buyers and maybe things like this will be fixed if they ever make another.

												This must be the most underrated rpg ever. I mean come on, you have a huge world to explore, tons of quests and gorgeous graphics, even now when this game is suposed to be old. Give it a chance even it's not your kind of rpg or Skyrim :). You can ride horses ( no, you can't fight from the horse's back but that is not so important in this game) they are easy to control, you can pick locks, you can upgrade armors, amulets, weapons and all this you can do it in your inventory . The recipe sistem for potions is amazing, you can create and name whatever potion you like. So try this game if you are a true rpg fan and don't compare it to Skyrim..come on you can do better than that :)))			",414,69,13,61,27,4,59

												I bought this game when it was 80% off and I'm positively surprised. I was looking for some RPG with an interesting story to sink into, and this game did just that, and much much more. It somehow brings to mind the Gothic series, however, it has much more interesting and complicated side quests - literally every time resolved somehow differently then you would think they would end. Also, the game has its own original ways of tackling common RPG features, such as magic, armed combat etc. I fully recommend this title.			",20,8,0,7,2,0,2

												Compared to the first game the gameplay is massively improved.  Not good mind you, but passable.However they changed the actor for the main character, the main character in the first game sounded like a vaudeville villain at times, and had some fantastic lines.  Your char in this game is a bored Californian.Still it is cheap as♥♥♥♥♥♥and playable.			",93,15,1,31,11,0,22

												Two Worlds II is more a disappointment than a failure.This game had so much potential but it sadly ended up as an unfinished mess,but if your interested in an solo/online RPG with a lot of flaws and just want to play it for s*** and giggles i would definitely recommend it to you.

												Two Worlds 2. Alright so I'm updating this after 2 years because golly it was bad. (This is still going to be bad.)So first off I'm going to base this review on the multiplayer primarily, even though it's not the main focus of the game. Just because of the 70+ hours, 60 or so have been in MP.When you first start MP you are given the choice between varying classes/subclasses. These include a fighter, ranger and mage with subclasses for the fighter and the mage. The subs change various skills and make the player more proficient in different combat styles/magic.Once you enter the your character you can join a European hub server. There are 50 of these each able to hold... 50 players? Not actually sure on that. But once you connect you'll join a small city market district where you'll see other players. From here you can look at shops and meet others. You can then proceed to create a lobby and select a game mode you want to play.As adventure mode is the one I've primarily played I'll be talking about it exclusively.It's a story based coop mode that has small-mid open world maps linked one after each other  based on a narrative. As far as I'm aware you are playing the role of someone serving the main antagonist of the singleplayer. Once you start a game it becomes a listen server and the one who hosted the game is now the host of the server.The combat in the game is... hard to get into, for some. I personally don't mind it, though I wish it did have a back step like the first one. (It might but I'm just blanking on it.) It's a lock-on style combat where one enemy is selected at a time. You are given 3-6 skills on your hotbar to use. In normal stance you can only use three, but holding down right clock changes them to another 2-3.Too lazy to continue.Had more fun in this than Fallout 4, and at least this is a RPG. 8/10			",235,22,1,43,32,2,45

												I wish there was more of an in between option for voting. I want to like this game, and I still do... But it really fell short of my expectations. I've only played about 4 hours at this time, so please take my review with a grain of salt.Pros:Modeling & texturingCharacter creationUI designCons:Weird controlsPoorly-written dialogueCliche plotAnimationPoorly written & designed in-game booksBugsI really thought the modeling and texturing of the game looked really professional. The game does look quite pretty. Even the character creation gives you great options for an attractive character. Most other games with character creation have ugly hairstyles, or a million options for ugly faces. Two Worlds II delivered on this point. However, that was about the extent of what appealed to me. As everyone else has mentioned, the controls are pretty weird. Not like it's the end of the world, but it takes a while to get used to.The plot (so far) is cheesy, dialogue feels really awkward, and the animation is clunky. Really clunky. I like reading the lore in games, so I naturally picked up some books. The writing was... pretty bad. I was surprised at the lack of proofreading, and as a graphic design student, the typography absolutely made me cringe. (Most people probably wouldn't care as much.)Combat is okay, but not great. They don't tell you that you can dual-wield swords, which I found out on accident. It helped me get through a challenging spot since it's pretty OP, so I guess that's the way to go. And stealth is okay, when it works. One of the bugs I had was walking into an enemy and repeatedly swinging without getting a stealth kill or doing any damage. Of course, he didn't notice me until I stood up fight normally, which was then no problem.In Conclusion:A small part of me still feels like Two Worlds II is a decent piece of entertainment, but it has a lot of problems. It absolutely is not on par with AAA games like Skyrim, so you will be disappointed if that's what you expect. I'll probably play more of it, but at this point there are a lot of better RPGs on Steam I'd rather play. If you're a die-hard RPG fan and love cheesy plots and dialogue, I'd say go for it. I just can't say that the game is for everyone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't let the mixed review get you. If you like RPG games in a fantasy setting like Dungeon Siege, Elder Scrolls or Fable, you're probably gonna like this game.HOWEVER, you will need a controller to play this. I first tried this game(didn't play the first one) and not only did I stop playing, but I even uninstalled it. However, I spent $5 on this and I wanted to get my money back so I reinstalled it. Turns out its pretty GOOD(with caps) once you get used to it. Trust me you need time to love this game. I would probably rate this game 7.5-8 for this game out of 9 hours of gameplay.

												Whoever thinks putting 3 different movement commands on the same key is evil. It gets difficult sometimes when crouch, block, and dash are all the same key, and caused many a reload. The story is rather bland and some of the quest lines are rather short. Other than that the game had the potential to be a lot better if they hired better writers and voice actors - that and the pain of the 3 commands in one button.			",302,56,11,90,28,3,55

I do recommend buying the game together with the DLC in some sale (I got both of them for like two (bucks), play the main campaign if you really have no better games in your sigh or skip it and start with this great DLC (although you will decide to do this you will face a very challanging game if you won't know the gameplay).Oh, and the graphics are meh.

												I have tried to get into this game.  I enjoyed the first one, mainly because I liked the storyline.  Combat was fun, as well.  The only thing that got to me in Two Worlds is the voice acting, which ended up being more comical than deal breaking.I wasn't eager to get Two Worlds II but I ended up getting it during the Christmas Sales not this past Christmas but the Christmas before.  Since then I have given it several tries, as a friend of mine has tried to convince me that it's worth getting through the first part of the game.Pros:1.  Great graphics... I have to give them that.  The scenes are gorgeous and they did a superb job with the modeling (though my guy looked like he was supposed to have gray spots in his hair, but it ended up looking like he had some kind of bugs attached to his scalp).  Armor modeling was awesome.  Their graphics team needs some kudos for their work.2. Uh...  ""Better"" voice acting?3.  Story line seems interesting.Yucks:The COMBAT!  Ugh!  Way too clunky.  No skill taken into account... it's click as fast as you can with the left mouse button and ""hope"" you hit them.  The AI is random so sometimes they run away.  You attack a boar and a gang of OSTRICH attack you.  WTF?  Really?  You're surrounded by beasts and you still can't even hit one, even though you're aiming right at it.  And don't even try to use a bow! The physics & targeting system is $#^@ >.<  Sneak attack is overpowered as h.e.double.hockeysticks, if you get lucky and are allowed to use it (seems you can only use it against humanoids) or are even ABLE to use it.  You can't have any weapons drawn to sneak because they mapped block to the same key as sneak, which is also the same key for run.   So you are blocking when you want to run, running when you mean to sneak... you get the picture.Okay... my point... don't get it.  Even if it is on sale.  You'll hate yourself because most likely it's going to be chosing between another game that is on sale.  Go with the other one.  I'm done trying.  Uninstalling forever.  Wish I could just give this dang game away.   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In my honest opinion it could have been a really great game and had a great wrap up with rewards for wining instead you fight the same way over and over no challenge to then given no real reward or satisfaction.  bottom line. Play something else like skyrim at least you feel some sort of acomplishment even if you are doing all the side missions .			",215,22,0,30,20,2,31

I do recommend buying the game together with the DLC in some sale (I got both of them for like two (bucks), play the main campaign if you really have no better games in your sigh or skip it and start with this great DLC (although you will decide to do this you will face a very challanging game if you won't know the gameplay).Oh, and the graphics are meh. Thankfuly the music has some hidden diamonds.			",72,60,0,18,4,1,8

The story is rather bland and some of the quest lines are rather short. Other than that the game had the potential to be a lot better if they hired better writers and voice actors - that and the pain of the 3 commands in one button.			",302,56,11,90,28,3,55

												Two worlds II, What to say? I kinda like it even though its not that polished. The character models look horrible, the storyline is a joke, the voice acting isn't the best and there are so many mishaps over the game. But all of these things actually put a smile on my face. There is a strange charm about this game. I give this game a 6/10. The whole game is pretty much a joke but it is still enjoyable in many ways. I can recommend you guys that are RPG fans to pick it up now when its on sale. Play it with friends and have a great time together :)			",6,0,0,2,0,0,0

												Don't let the mixed review get you. If you like RPG games in a fantasy setting like Dungeon Siege, Elder Scrolls or Fable, you're probably gonna like this game.HOWEVER, you will need a controller to play this. I first tried this game(didn't play the first one) and not only did I stop playing, but I even uninstalled it. However, I spent $5 on this and I wanted to get my money back so I reinstalled it. Turns out its pretty GOOD(with caps) once you get used to it. Trust me you need time to love this game. I would probably rate this game 7.5-8 for this game out of 9 hours of gameplay.

The whomever the ♥♥♥♥ cliche faceless almsot hilarious looking Villian's cape glitched up and went in front of him like a giant bib. I would not recommend this to anyone... ever.

												I have tried to get into this game.  I enjoyed the first one, mainly because I liked the storyline.  Combat was fun, as well.  The only thing that got to me in Two Worlds is the voice acting, which ended up being more comical than deal breaking.I wasn't eager to get Two Worlds II but I ended up getting it during the Christmas Sales not this past Christmas but the Christmas before.  Since then I have given it several tries, as a friend of mine has tried to convince me that it's worth getting through the first part of the game.Pros:1.  Great graphics... I have to give them that.  The scenes are gorgeous and they did a superb job with the modeling (though my guy looked like he was supposed to have gray spots in his hair, but it ended up looking like he had some kind of bugs attached to his scalp).  Armor modeling was awesome.  Their graphics team needs some kudos for their work.2. Uh...  ""Better"" voice acting?3.  Story line seems interesting.Yucks:The COMBAT!  Ugh!  Way too clunky.  No skill taken into account... it's click as fast as you can with the left mouse button and ""hope"" you hit them.  The AI is random so sometimes they run away.  You attack a boar and a gang of OSTRICH attack you.  WTF?  Really?  You're surrounded by beasts and you still can't even hit one, even though you're aiming right at it.  And don't even try to use a bow! The physics & targeting system is $#^@ >.<  Sneak attack is overpowered as h.e.double.hockeysticks, if you get lucky and are allowed to use it (seems you can only use it against humanoids) or are even ABLE to use it.  You can't have any weapons drawn to sneak because they mapped block to the same key as sneak, which is also the same key for run.   So you are blocking when you want to run, running when you mean to sneak... you get the picture.Okay... my point... don't get it.  Even if it is on sale.  You'll hate yourself because most likely it's going to be chosing between another game that is on sale.  Go with the other one.  I'm done trying.  Uninstalling forever.  Wish I could just give this dang game away.   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played the crap out of this game when it first came out, but only the multiplayer part. That alone is worth the 20 bucks as you can easily get 40 hours out of it. The spell system is so absolutely fantastic, it makes you wonder why you would play any other class. Probably spent 10+ hours building random spells just to see how they work. If only they had made the campaign multiplayer, this game would probably be one of the biggest hits ever.The single player game, for what little I played, was fun, and had a similar feel as the elderscrolls games. One thing I disliked, but came to appreciate for the level of detail, was getting hassled by guards for bumping into people on the street. Worth a play through if you are looking for a good solo fantasy game.			",212,10,0,44,11,0,14

												I seriously can't understand the hate, this game is a gem!Well, I've already played Two Worlds II years ago in the retail edition. I thought a lot of times about getting it on steam, but hesitated, bc of bad reviews (mostly the DRM). Downloaded > installed > did not run, but found that just Nvidia physX (located in the game folder) needs to be installed > started, made a very simple registration > the game runs perfectly, and still feels like in the old days!What is so great about this game? It is very creative, you have a crafting/weapon upgrading system, cool alchemy and witchcraft system, so it is not like a mainstream RPG. It has got it's flaws, no question, but there is one big thing: THIS GAME HAS A SOUL, IT FEELS ALIVE! And that's something I was missing in the TES games, which appear to be a lot more static compared to this one. Maybe not in the first prologue part, but after you start on the first island, you wanna get lost in this game just to find yourself after hours, wondering what time it is and when your birthday is. So many things to discover, and it makes even fun to read the books you find.Give it a try and thank me later!			",167,27,1,25,8,0,27

												Full disclosure: I got this in a past Humble Bundle, and thank god I did, because this isn't worth whatever I did pay for it, much less the price they're asking.The graphics aren't bad, and the soundtrack, what I heard of it, is excellent, but who knows what the controls are and whoever designed it doesn't know things like how armor works and how to write an interesting story. The frankly awful DRM, which, while I understand their desire for demographic research and the ability to mail/email me promotions, I own this on Steam I've hardly stolen it, is just the cherry on top I'm afraid. I'm frankly not going to enter my CD key every time I play, especially not if I have to give some unknown thing a bunch of my personal information, including my physical address just to get the game I own out of demo mode. It's buggy and difficult to play (I got trapped halfway inside a gate three cutscenes in) and just, not that much fun.I really, really wanted to like it. The cutscene martial arts look like something straight out of a Chinese Period drama, all slo mo and flying through the air and fancy tricks, on paper it has an interesting premise, but it needs some serious TLC before it'll be worth playing.

I would probably describe it as more of a puzzler than anything else as I've faced many challenging mysteries during the short time I've played. Why does it perform a first time set up every time I open it?Why does the game need my postal address?Why do my keyboard and mouse not work upon opening it two thirds of the time?Will it ever acually connect and be able to register?These are just some of the challenges you will face if you decide to get Two Worlds 2.

												A lot of people on steam will play a game for 10 minutes and judge the entire thing based on that. the first time i played this game my save deleted itself 6 times. 3 months later i tried it again on a slow sunday and when i realised my save was fine the next day i kept playing... and kept playing... and kept playing until my macbook overheated on the train. it's not the best game out there not by a long hot but if you have the time and the patience you wont be displeased. its combat can get boring at time but you can change your style so much in one playthough that it really doesnt matter i mean for example The Witcher was one of my favourite games when it was first released but the combat in that game had me in tears. There arent many games that will let you beat a Rhino to death with a sledge hammer or have monkey's throw♥♥♥♥♥♥at you while riding your horse (the horse is also broken). The game has this Instagram like filter over it when you're out in the open and it kills your eyes after a while but sometimes... just sometimes you'll lookat your scrren after you've fought your way through an entire field of warthogs and think... this doesnt look like♥♥♥♥♥♥on a stick.It's a game I'd advise anyone to play. I had fun playing it and these reveiws arent all about if a game is broken or has bugs or not because there isn't a game out there that has NO bugs what so ever. So give it a try... maybe buy it on a sale though... £14 is a little steap for a game that has made my punch my standing fan.			",58,7,0,5,1,0,2

												I played this game few years ago when it was pretty fresh and I loved it. The graphics are amazing even by today's standard, the combat is really easy to master (but not necessarily every enemy is easy to be defeated), quests are really interesting without letting you feel that you are grinding and the story is well put together. This game came out of nowhere and was a huge pleasant surprise especially when other big franchise games like Risen, Gothic were not yet there.I saw it again recently and bought it and am still enjoying it fully!If you want to kill 50-100 hours, well this is a good choice :)			",50,4,0,12,1,0,1

												Again I wish there was a middle option between recommend and not.Two Worlds 2 is a great improvement over the first game which was a complete crap hole. Its really ""janky"" kind of like deadly premonition. Iits got a bad but loveable feel to it. The dialouge is entertaining and some characters are well enough written. The combat system isnt amazing but it works. Actually, thats a pretty good summary about everything in this game. Its not amazing but it works.It wears out its welcome though. So many side quests and fetch quests and the main story quests never really go anywhere. I forgot what I was even doing half the time.I played about 18 hours of the game and didnt quit out of hate or rage. I quit out of.... disdain? I just didnt really care to keep going.If you are really in to open world action rpgs, and can get past some janky controls, then get the game on a sale. Otherwise you can pass this one up.

												Two Worlds 2. Alright so I'm updating this after 2 years because golly it was bad. (This is still going to be bad.)So first off I'm going to base this review on the multiplayer primarily, even though it's not the main focus of the game. Just because of the 70+ hours, 60 or so have been in MP.When you first start MP you are given the choice between varying classes/subclasses. These include a fighter, ranger and mage with subclasses for the fighter and the mage. The subs change various skills and make the player more proficient in different combat styles/magic.Once you enter the your character you can join a European hub server. There are 50 of these each able to hold... 50 players? Not actually sure on that. But once you connect you'll join a small city market district where you'll see other players. From here you can look at shops and meet others. You can then proceed to create a lobby and select a game mode you want to play.As adventure mode is the one I've primarily played I'll be talking about it exclusively.It's a story based coop mode that has small-mid open world maps linked one after each other  based on a narrative. As far as I'm aware you are playing the role of someone serving the main antagonist of the singleplayer. Once you start a game it becomes a listen server and the one who hosted the game is now the host of the server.The combat in the game is... hard to get into, for some. I personally don't mind it, though I wish it did have a back step like the first one. (It might but I'm just blanking on it.) It's a lock-on style combat where one enemy is selected at a time. You are given 3-6 skills on your hotbar to use. In normal stance you can only use three, but holding down right clock changes them to another 2-3.Too lazy to continue.Had more fun in this than Fallout 4, and at least this is a RPG. 8/10			",235,22,1,43,32,2,45

I've only played about 4 hours at this time, so please take my review with a grain of salt.Pros:Modeling & texturingCharacter creationUI designCons:Weird controlsPoorly-written dialogueCliche plotAnimationPoorly written & designed in-game booksBugsI really thought the modeling and texturing of the game looked really professional. The game does look quite pretty. Even the character creation gives you great options for an attractive character. Most other games with character creation have ugly hairstyles, or a million options for ugly faces. Two Worlds II delivered on this point. However, that was about the extent of what appealed to me. As everyone else has mentioned, the controls are pretty weird. Not like it's the end of the world, but it takes a while to get used to.The plot (so far) is cheesy, dialogue feels really awkward, and the animation is clunky. Really clunky. I like reading the lore in games, so I naturally picked up some books. The writing was... pretty bad. I was surprised at the lack of proofreading, and as a graphic design student, the typography absolutely made me cringe. (Most people probably wouldn't care as much.)Combat is okay, but not great. They don't tell you that you can dual-wield swords, which I found out on accident. It helped me get through a challenging spot since it's pretty OP, so I guess that's the way to go. And stealth is okay, when it works. One of the bugs I had was walking into an enemy and repeatedly swinging without getting a stealth kill or doing any damage. Of course, he didn't notice me until I stood up fight normally, which was then no problem.In Conclusion:A small part of me still feels like Two Worlds II is a decent piece of entertainment, but it has a lot of problems. It absolutely is not on par with AAA games like Skyrim, so you will be disappointed if that's what you expect. I'll probably play more of it, but at this point there are a lot of better RPGs on Steam I'd rather play. If you're a die-hard RPG fan and love cheesy plots and dialogue, I'd say go for it. I just can't say that the game is for everyone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played the crap out of this game when it first came out, but only the multiplayer part. That alone is worth the 20 bucks as you can easily get 40 hours out of it. The spell system is so absolutely fantastic, it makes you wonder why you would play any other class. Probably spent 10+ hours building random spells just to see how they work. If only they had made the campaign multiplayer, this game would probably be one of the biggest hits ever.The single player game, for what little I played, was fun, and had a similar feel as the elderscrolls games. One thing I disliked, but came to appreciate for the level of detail, was getting hassled by guards for bumping into people on the street. Worth a play through if you are looking for a good solo fantasy game.			",212,10,0,44,11,0,14

												Concept of this game is really good however, I do not like it. Worth the money - I dont know - find it out yourself. Characters are poorly designed and lags alot. Even in the first mission I was not able to find the switch for the hidden door. Either it was too dark or I dont have really good sense of finding things in this game.Overall, I really did not enjoy this game as much as I expected.			",23,1,0,6,8,0,1

												I have tried to get into this game.  I enjoyed the first one, mainly because I liked the storyline.  Combat was fun, as well.  The only thing that got to me in Two Worlds is the voice acting, which ended up being more comical than deal breaking.I wasn't eager to get Two Worlds II but I ended up getting it during the Christmas Sales not this past Christmas but the Christmas before.  Since then I have given it several tries, as a friend of mine has tried to convince me that it's worth getting through the first part of the game.Pros:1.  Great graphics... I have to give them that.  The scenes are gorgeous and they did a superb job with the modeling (though my guy looked like he was supposed to have gray spots in his hair, but it ended up looking like he had some kind of bugs attached to his scalp).  Armor modeling was awesome.  Their graphics team needs some kudos for their work.2. Uh...  ""Better"" voice acting?3.  Story line seems interesting.Yucks:The COMBAT!  Ugh!  Way too clunky.  No skill taken into account... it's click as fast as you can with the left mouse button and ""hope"" you hit them.  The AI is random so sometimes they run away.  You attack a boar and a gang of OSTRICH attack you.  WTF?  Really?  You're surrounded by beasts and you still can't even hit one, even though you're aiming right at it.  And don't even try to use a bow! The physics & targeting system is $#^@ >.<  Sneak attack is overpowered as h.e.double.hockeysticks, if you get lucky and are allowed to use it (seems you can only use it against humanoids) or are even ABLE to use it.  You can't have any weapons drawn to sneak because they mapped block to the same key as sneak, which is also the same key for run.   So you are blocking when you want to run, running when you mean to sneak... you get the picture.Okay... my point... don't get it.  Even if it is on sale.  You'll hate yourself because most likely it's going to be chosing between another game that is on sale.  Go with the other one.  I'm done trying.  Uninstalling forever.  Wish I could just give this dang game away.   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is really poor. It looks quite good, although the combat system is actually full of odd glitches (weird jumping, drowning horses, poor interaction with the terrain). The main problem is that the plot and quests are insanely stupid. They make no sense in driving the story forwards (just putting hurdles put in a player's way and making them jump over them) and generally make almost no sense even in the game's terms (like a riding race you need to win, which is witnessed by no-one and in the end the current holder of the title just accepts whatever you say - ""yeah, sure I did it faster than you!""; except you're not allowed to say this until you do ""win"" the race).I lost interest after about 10-15 hours and I won't go back to it.

												Although I usually try to give games several hours to draw me in, I find myself completely unable to do so with this one.  While the game doesn't look terribly bad, the animations and combat are abysmal at best.  The voice acting is decent but the conversations involve people going through one of two really low quality animations that just look like everyone is shrugging.  The default key bindings are incredibly odd and while they are rebindable, the way the combat works makes it redundant.  Going into stealth mode requires you to be standing completely still, as does blocking.  If you are moving at all you will instead start sprinting.

												Ok graphics, good game mechanics and it's fun to play. However the voice acting is probably the worst I have ever heard in a game ever - it's like it was scripted and acted by someone with the emotional depth of a 10 year old. Your character is frankly quite creepy too since he often has a good laugh after killing animals. I would have said that this was an ok buy if you get it for a dollar or two as I did but now having got half way through chapter one the game has started crashing frequently shortly after I summon a creature (this is on a relatively recent Mac BookPro). So at this point I'd not recommend it to anyone with a mac at any price - no clue whether it is more stable on windows. ",16,0,0,6,5,0,12

												I really want it to be good. It's a huge game. You spend a lot of time in the begining on two main islands. Both feel pretty large. But if you zoom out of the map you'll realise theres a whole other island you haven't even been to yet that's five times as big as the other two islands combined. That's a great feeling.But oh my gosh is this game hard to control. You are so clunky! Everything is clunky! The melee combat is just gross to experience, range is either way too easy or way too hard and doesn't feel natural either way, magic is fun to mess around with but is also hard to use in combat especially if you have allies with you. That fire bomb spell doesn't know what the word friendly means. Doors are hard to open, jumping is grotesque, running looks and feels stupid especially if you prefer to carry a staff or polearm. Even the simplest actions like opening chests or picking up loose items is difficult. The loading times for containers is way too long and breaks up the whole game. I can't express enough how clunky this game feels. For a game with so much content, i'm straight up mad the fighting actually makes it unenjoyable to play.It's not even like this game is that old. There are no excuses. Especially since the first in the series had the same problem and they failed to fix it. And the fact the game freezes while it loads the next area sometimes is really annoying.On a positive note, this instalment improved upon the first Two Worlds in a lot of ways. The world is bigger, there are more kinds of enemies, cooler weapons, better story, necromancy is legal yay! However, it's just as clunky as the first game and really quite hard to play because of it. If the mobility in Two Worlds didn't bother you then you will definitely like this game. If however you're used to rpg's like Skyrim get ready for pure movement hell. ",71,4,1,9,7,0,5

												So far, I've only played the so-called Network mode, which I guess it the 'multiplayer' online modes,  and I guess these quests are probably 'ment' for multiple players since the monsters/quests don't seem to scale very good for solo players, and considering I've seen about 3 people playing so far...  Example of this is on the 2nd mission 'through the mine' where countless groups of 5 or so skeletons/Dread Knights spawn from thin air and attack you - its slow going considering the method of running in, killing the ranged mobs and retreating to heal takes along time - its all possible solo until you start running into Tuloks which are practically invinicible not to mention can stun lock you easily, and there are two of them making it nearly impossible single player. Combat is fairly terrible, very minimal defensive options, no dodge and very poor block commands.  For melee characters its more of a spam attacks and hope affair.  At least in the original TW you had a backstep which helped significantly. I haven't played the Single player yet so I'll edit this review to reflect SP mode soon - as for network mode, avoid completely.  If your thinking of buying this game for the MP, do yourself a favor and don't.			",574,171,25,105,82,4,89

												first...its a graet game with a pretty cool crafting system in it for spells and poitions and equipment uprgading , especially the spell crafting is really cool, you can create a ton of spells......the landscape looks pretty nice and theres a lot to adventure...BUT...you can get it on amazon for 3,99€ together with the expansion 6,99€ i think...And for this price you get a new boxed version with a real map inside and without advertisemnt banner in the main menu i think....so thats the reason i wont recommend buying it on steam....check amazon or other shops ebay or something like that...much cheaper same game or even more....

												Once a  long time ago when I was young (lets say the 70''s) there was agame that was a little different called Two Worlds.I was useds to the old way of playing RPG's and this new game was a little bit different.  I plaued it quickly and passed up a lot of side quests in my rush to get to the end.    This was a BAD move.  I soon got tired of getting killed so I put it aside.  Then a friend gave me a copy of theepic edition and Two Worlds Two,  I tri8ed to be patient but still had a hard time  with it because it made me think out of the box, so to speak.   At this time the company that was selling it would help you out if you just sent an email to support.  They would help you and even give you cheat codes like the horse race against the click to finish the starvation quest.     Now after all thes years I find the yo dated T^wo Worlds Two game on sale on steam.  I buy it and have trouble again with many of t6he quests like before but no help from thr conpany Except by there forum.  which I had  problems getting onto till just recently due to nissspeling the user name I used way back then.  I am not sure I will take up the game againas I found it difficult follow the main quest because I found my self stuck in a main quest.  For example when I was facing tge son of the fire God in the swamp my level 37 fighter did not last more than a few seconds.  The strat guide said ""just let him chase you around till he gets low on power then finish him off.  So much for the strat guide's help.  I discopvered by accident that I could fire arrows at him fasat and they would stun him and thus I could kill him with my bow, albeit it did take a long while.    I now find my self apparently done in the swamp with no way out except to take the tunnel to the castle which gives ny character about 10 seconds of life.  Now this does not make sense because there is a whole big Island to explore so I must have skiped something in getting out of the swamp .    Just like when my level 26 fighter reached the top of the Tower of Fang's and could not even dent the guardian.  Once again the trusty strat guide was no help.  Having played this game long ago I manahed to get to New Athos by a combination   of walk on water potions and swiming.   When I  finished enough quests to kill the guardian I returned to the tower and killed him.Now you ask do i RECOMEND THIS GAME  i WOULD GIVE YOU A RESOUNDING  Y-E-S!!!.  It is  that is done a little bit differeently and a great game.  Some of the plot twists are hard to solve but I still liked the game.  I DDO NOT recomed the strat guide except it is nessasary to get back on the main quest or some of the more esoteric side quests.   The reason I have stopped playing was the possibility that would not be able to get onto the forum.  Even if I do it is not the same as the old days when they actually answered an emaik sent to support@ there wep site.Even with as the frustratin If I can get back on the forum I will give the game one more chance but I do not think I will get all the information I used to get way back when.  It will be agame that I will always like even if I do not finish it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As Two Worlds 1, Two Worlds II is a ""so bad it's good"". The voice acting, the animation, the dungeon design, the map design, the quests, the story are all mediocre to terrible. Why do i recommend this game then? Because if you are able to surpass the deep layer of bad design and glitches you will be able to find that it is a fun game, and most of the time it is pretty enjoyable. As said, the dungeon's layout isn't usually really good, but the enviroment design is on point. If you are an avid GDR player, you should give it a try, expecially becouse it is usually on sale.I will look forward to Two Worlds III, i liked the first one, and the second improved greatly on that on many aspects.

												This game will feel you with all different emotions> You will laugh, you will cry and stand back in amazment at times. Unfortunantly it wont be because the game is good.  I laughed because of the voice acting, I cried because I had to listen to the voice acting and spent 10 dollars on the game. Then I was in amazment because the graphics were so bad and because the game made me do all that. All jokes aside though, if you want a game similar to skyrim then scoot on by this one.

												Single PlayerVery slow paced, slow traveling and there isn't anything really special or interesting besides the ability to craft spells, which some spells can be quite hilarious, but that fun factor is short lived. Also, there is no way to change time or fast foward time (i.e. Elder Scrolls games you can wait or sleep till the sun rises), so if you made it to a town and its night time where shops are closed and people are locked up in their homes you have to... leave the game running or explore.. or something till the sun rises. Lockpicking and pickpocketing is by little minigames that gets old fast. I can't bring myself to continue playing single player mode at all after an hour or two.Multi PlayerNon-shared loot can get frustrating if you are not playing with friends. A little more fast paced than single player with a lot of mobs to kill to keep you busy, and the extra mobs to help you level up faster. If you party with lots of people who like to summon mobs it will turn into a sh*tfest quickly. Also no more than 2 melee summoned creature per target; the rest of your summons will stand still and do nothing blocking other players since you can't walk through mobs.  There are different types of Multiplayer settings, I spent most of it on Adventure playing with a friend. I randomly disconnected and saw I was accused of using a trainer and got temp banned. I was low level and poor with little to no equipment upgrades, a lot of empty accessories (no gems), ran away from a bunch of mobs, while using lots of health potions and half dying all the time with my friend. There are better games to grind that have a much larger community (say ~50 players max online/ingame). BTW I didn't have any problems with registering (I have a router + firewall) and only gave general information (don't think they have to be true either).tl;drBought this game on sale for ~$5 including a DLC. Don't bother with this game unless you have friends to play with in multiplayer and at the really low price I got it for.4/10 (+2 sale price, +2 magic crafting system).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For its price, Two Worlds II is totally worth it.It's a bit slow-paced and travelling on foot can be boring (the main ""con"" of this game is it feels a little empty for an open-world RPG.)Oh, and the quest log sucks.But ignore this and enjoy all the cool features : good amount of diverse equipement, fits different archetypes (mage, warrior, archer (stealth isn't that good in-game so I won't say it fits the thieft archetype))Beautiful environements, nice sound and music design... Tons of side-quests, medium-sized skill trees... But wait there's more : the alchemy features allows you to combine whatever you want and create diversified potions, you can create your own spells and deconstruct useless equipement to upgrade the useful one.Definitely a good RPG that is worth every dollar of its price.79/100			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Two Worlds II is best described as a diamond in the rough, it's got some very fun gameplay and the spell creation system is amazing since you can combo spells to create things like anvil tornados. The voice acting is pretty good and the dialogue is genuinely funny, some of the animation are a bit unpolished and the enemy AI is serviceable but unimpressive, don't expect any advanced strategies here. The gear customization is great and each island you visit has a very different feel and look to it in terms of monsters and terrain.  However when you add it all up, this is actually a solidly good game.			",88,27,0,21,6,0,11

												The game is fairly solid overall, and wondefully captures that big-world feel with a suprisingly solid sense of realism. I actually enjoyed it so far after spending a few hours on it.Sure, it does have a couple drawbacks (but what games don't?). Namely...- I feel the character control should have been made a lot tighter & snappier, without that silly sliding stop also. This would have made such a huge diff. It isn't super bad now, but it could have definitely been implemented better. I'd say this is my number one issue with this game.- The registration nonsense of the game is just a needless PITA (although thankfully it's only a one-time thing).But make no mistake about it, the graphics and atmosphere are absolutely spell-binding in this game, with solid character modelling and voice-acting. Story is so-so, passable.And for the low sale price, you won't find anything better out there, that's for sure.I'd rate this game a solid 7/10 as it stands (would have been higher with snappier character/combat control).

												Usually I go in depth with my recommendations, but this game is downright horrible aside from graphics / art.Combat mechanic is lackluster in impact, functionality and general engagement. Ranged and magic combat is weak, though magic has a unique touch of ""mixing and matching"" your own spells (i.e., placing fire element, water or ice element to a ""shield-self"" spell, causes different effects.) Though general combat targeting and visual impact is weak.Voice acting is sub par.Inventory screen, general interface (including options menu) is horrendous. Story is relatively interesting but broken by the horrendous game mechanics.It's got good concepts, but just terrible execution.In truth, I managed to finish this game once a long time ago when games were less... Impressive. But now that there are so many titles similar to this game out there, you can easily notice the flaws of Two Worlds II. Frankly, even the menu of this game is downright terrible. Despite the fact that this game was on sale for only 10$, I still recommend spending your money elsewhere.In short, it's a hard game to get into. But once you overlook everything.... You'll be able to have at least one or maybe (though doubtful) two playthroughs.			",94,9,0,18,0,0,9

												There are some atrocious games on steam, some of which can be fun even if purely for the sake of how bad they are, But ""Two Worlds II"" Has got to be the biggest pile of trash I've ever had the misfortune of installing, After spending 1hr and 43m installing extra software that's needed for the stupid amounts of pre-loading crashes (Two Worlds II has stopped responding, Two Worlds II has stopped working, Two Worlds II Has encountered an error and needs to close), Such as PhysX from a year prior to the games original release (?!) I loaded into the game, The entry music was reasonably good but that is LITERALLY all that there is to enjoy about it, I've spent 24 minutes playing and about... 15 of those have been AMV's which were choppy, slow and beyond pointless, In the few moments I did get to play the game the controls were stiff and unresponsive, the camera control was overly sensitive (Even for me and I LOVE sensitive vision controls) and finally, combat... Can you even call it that? It's literally spam clicking until one of you is dead, there's no power attacks, there's no blocking, there's no dodging asides from hitting the jump button which... throws you in a random direction, usually towards the enemy you're trying to step away from and when you do end up getting hurt to the point you're about to die, The repetitive slam of that death tune is so incessant you'll end up voluntarily getting killed just to end it! All in all, If I could give it less than 1 I would. ",105,4,1,20,8,0,18

												Two Worlds II is another one of those promising games that take you absolutely nowhere.Gameplay is pretty solid, a 7/10 to say the least, combat feels good and responsive, actions are quickly performed, movement is smooth and you won't feel like it takes four hours to walk from point A to point B, even though the game world is large enough. There is a decent amount of habilities, magic spells, weapons and armors to buy and upgrade, but they are bound to level, meaning that they'll only appear on the game world once you reach a certain level, so if you want to relive the thrill of finding that overpowered legendary item in a chest deep down a cave full of perilous monsters, forget that. All you're gonna get are some lockpicks, a medium healing potion and a wizard's hat. And that is if you're a warrior. 'Cause if you play a mage, the game will make sure that there's a warrior helm in that chest, just so you won't be able to use what you find, a very common issue in modern RPGs.The game world is pretty large, composed of some three major islands, each one of them themed around something like middle-east, asian, and european designs of builduings, flora and fauna. There are plenty of quests to be done and there's a fair amount of NPCs, but none of them are memorable or even good at all. You're going to do a lot of running around, a little bit of riding around on a horse and even less sailing around, because you only get a boat too ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ late, and that is another issue with modern RPGs. What the ♥♥♥♥ is wrong with giving the player a ship from the start, so he or she can have some fun sailing around the islands? Anyway, It seems like there's a lot to do, but there isn't, really.Which brings us to the last point of this review and, by far, the worst thing in this game, not to mention the reason for me to not recomend Two Worlds II to anyone: The game suffers from a all-too-common rushed ending. The first major island will take you quite a long time to complete, since there's a lot to do and see. The second one, a little bit less. The third you can almost skip completely, since there's very little to do on it. The plot is also extremely rushed, with a huge deus ex machina right at the ending, throwing everything you've been doing on the main quest since the start out of the window.All in all, this game dosen't deserve more than a 5/10 and I would only recomend it if you, like me, have played pretty much every other RPG on existence. You might have some fun with it, but you would probably rather play something else instead.Gameplay - 8/10Soundtrack - 6/10Graphics - 7/10Content - 4/10Challenge Level - 5/10Replayability - 3/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You can only connect to certain people half the time, making multiplayer with friends nearly impossible. The game crashes randomly, costing you all your progress. Not to mention the fact that this game has been out for ages and has yet to receive any sort of work fixing the massive problems it has.Good game, but its unplayable in its current state.

												This games deserves more attention, it's a good roleplay with multiplayer system. Where SKYRIM and Kingdoms of Amalur failed to succeed, Two worlds 2 do it greatly.Also, for the sincerely jokers who aways peek around, here the valid comment:I've lured a stone golem into a city in the hope of NPCs helps me to fight him, golem killed us all.10/10 would lure again.

												There are some atrocious games on steam, some of which can be fun even if purely for the sake of how bad they are, But ""Two Worlds II"" Has got to be the biggest pile of trash I've ever had the misfortune of installing, After spending 1hr and 43m installing extra software that's needed for the stupid amounts of pre-loading crashes (Two Worlds II has stopped responding, Two Worlds II has stopped working, Two Worlds II Has encountered an error and needs to close), Such as PhysX from a year prior to the games original release (?!) I loaded into the game, The entry music was reasonably good but that is LITERALLY all that there is to enjoy about it, I've spent 24 minutes playing and about... 15 of those have been AMV's which were choppy, slow and beyond pointless, In the few moments I did get to play the game the controls were stiff and unresponsive, the camera control was overly sensitive (Even for me and I LOVE sensitive vision controls) and finally, combat... Can you even call it that? It's literally spam clicking until one of you is dead, there's no power attacks, there's no blocking, there's no dodging asides from hitting the jump button which... throws you in a random direction, usually towards the enemy you're trying to step away from and when you do end up getting hurt to the point you're about to die, The repetitive slam of that death tune is so incessant you'll end up voluntarily getting killed just to end it! All in all, If I could give it less than 1 I would. ",105,4,1,20,8,0,18

												If you are looking to buy this game, please heed my warning.Do not step into multiplayer, if you can't speak german. Multiplayer servers are riddled with german people, who won't speak english. They understand english, but they just wont speak it.Now with that warning out of the way.This game is very good. Graphics are pleasant and not that demanding. If you ever get bored of bashing groms and doglike humanoid creatures, go to a town sit at a table, throw some dice or play a violin ! (yea you can do that)Magic system in this game are close to suppreme, I have spent many hours into this game mainly as a mage and I haven't even scratched the surface. You could make devastating spells that ricochet between enemies, everytime they ricoche they explode in 7 meter radius. Yeah that devastating.Melee system could need some rework. There are alot of fun moves in this game wich you can utilize to banish those pesky Necris back into their graves or maybe you could bash that friendly shopkeeper down a cliff. Who knows ?Archery is quite fun too, with the sniper mode you can mark several enemies to be shot with multi arrow. You can shoot elemental arrows fire, ice and poison. Distraction arrow is a fun mechanic, it summons a horrible creature at arrow location, who taunts your enemies.There are alot of loot to find and many creatures to be slain.			",247,25,1,38,27,1,33

												Usually I go in depth with my recommendations, but this game is downright horrible aside from graphics / art.Combat mechanic is lackluster in impact, functionality and general engagement. Ranged and magic combat is weak, though magic has a unique touch of ""mixing and matching"" your own spells (i.e., placing fire element, water or ice element to a ""shield-self"" spell, causes different effects.) Though general combat targeting and visual impact is weak.Voice acting is sub par.Inventory screen, general interface (including options menu) is horrendous. Story is relatively interesting but broken by the horrendous game mechanics.It's got good concepts, but just terrible execution.In truth, I managed to finish this game once a long time ago when games were less... Impressive. But now that there are so many titles similar to this game out there, you can easily notice the flaws of Two Worlds II. Frankly, even the menu of this game is downright terrible. Despite the fact that this game was on sale for only 10$, I still recommend spending your money elsewhere.In short, it's a hard game to get into. But once you overlook everything.... You'll be able to have at least one or maybe (though doubtful) two playthroughs.			",94,9,0,18,0,0,9

												I'll admit that I didn't even make my way out of the starting area before being put off.  The entire game world felt wooden; awkwardly imposed cut scenes and voice acting, being restricted to a 'demo version' unless I 'registered' the game with personal details and a slight swaying of the camera when the PC runs (I've never been sea-sick before, but I'd imagine this game will cause nausea in some).  Maybe they take more time to accustom to, but the controls also seemed iffy: I tried jumping from a staircase, but had to try a few times before managing to succeed. Seeing the positive reviews on here there's probably more to this game, but there's something about two worlds that just makes me want to hate it; right down to the big bad who's outraged by his prisoner escaping, but is too busy to walk over and stop it.  Maybe if I'm bored some day I'll give it another shot, but I certainly wouldn't recommend anyone purchase the game.Edit: maybe it was an intentional part of the tutorial/escape sequence, but the AI seemed awful.  I was chased by a swarm of guards, then ran back past them a few times.  None of them could attack me unless I stood still.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unlike most I was actually a big fan of the first Two Worlds and this was one of the few games I actually bought when it was released as opposed to waiting for it to go on sale.  Encounters can prove difficult at the start of the game and taking on more than one foe at once isn't always wise.  Once you're on par with the local wildlife at the start of the game is when Two Worlds 2 really starts to take off.  It's easy to forget about the storyline as you get sucked into all of the side quests that really seem to propel the game more than the story but it's just too much fun to stop.  I find nothing more enjoyable than venturing off into the distance just to find out what's there, destroying whatever stands in my way, and gearing myself along the way.  This game just keeps it coming like a 50 hour IV.			",194,46,0,77,3,2,9

												Two worlds 2, I was a bit worried about getting this one when i was looking for a rpg to play because of the bad energy the first recieved. However it came in a bundle deal for only about $7 and I say Iv'e definatly got my moneys worth. Sure some animations may be a bit clunky (however improves a bit with the dlc) the conenct itself is a real good time. At first things feel real strong against you with being 2-3 shot with the block being very strange mechanic only blocking a small amount of damage at the start and your shields do block projectiles but its more for apperance than anything you cant actualy raise to block. This being said the Progression system in this game made me love it especially spell crafting, using heaps of different combinations to make your own spell is pretty awsome(like anvil tornado or spraying projectiles with summoning).If your willing to overcome its buggyness to get use to the games many unique systemes(sailing for dlc, magic crafting) and want a rpg to kill alot of hours I reccomend go for it. Also if anyone know any other action/rpg or anything where you can sail id appreciate it			",131,13,3,20,8,3,28

												Two Worlds II is a fun Action RPG for fans of the genre, with some interesting customization ideas that make it stand out from other RPGs of similar quality. If you are a Warrior or a Ranger, you strengthen your equipment by Blacksmithing and Gems, if you are a Mage, you craft your spells by combining property cards into amulets and using them through a staff, and in any of the cases, you can Dye your armor in various colours or take advantage of Alchemy to brew special Potions.The game is precisely reminiscent of The Witcher, both in being a 3rd person Action RPG with customizations, and in the Main Protagonist, whose style of humor and even his voice, may remind you of Geralt of Rivia.On the down side, the game does suffer from quite a few bugs in specific quests and some things may also look unpolished. And typically, the ending may feel dissappointing depending on the player.			",258,58,7,33,14,2,39

												Tons of content in this RPG.  I have yet to finish the singleplayer, but so far it is a lot of fun.  Voice overs could be better, and some of the face models are ♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Multiplayer is a good time, has a seperate campaign to play with your friends, along with deathmatch and duels.  There is a multiplayer feature I have yet to touch, which is where you buy a village and can profit from the buildings you create within it, I believe you have to fend of creatures as well.  There are plenty of armor types to buy and trade in the multiplayer world.  I am also aware that there is a very broad magic system, as far as creating your own spells.If you enjoy RPGs get this one, if you don't have the $50 right now, you can wait for a deal, and live.

												Two Worlds Two has a dumb name, as a consequence of being a sequel to a game with ""Two"" in the title, and is generally pretty weird. It's huge, the magic system is crazy, the world is beautiful, and there's a few interesting quests and plot elements, but even still it's not for everyone. There's some really terrible voice acting, which is a bigger knock than you might expect as the worst character in that regard is the main character. Each world area you get to is deceptively smaller than the previous, also, slowly constricting you and forcing you down a main quest path that stalls in the final third of the game. The combat isn't 100% great, either.Even so, I feel it was unfairly maligned thanks to its predecessor's reputation and an overly-long tutorial. If you can get ahold of it on the cheap, I'd say it's worth trying out if you're a fan of open-world fantasy. There's a chance you might fall in love with at least one element of this weirdly disparate game.			",759,224,23,90,104,9,146

The creaton system for armors and weapons let you truly make each piece of equipment your own, and the spell crafting system let's you make cirtually any spell you can dream.

												IT'S A TRAP!No seriously. Some clever mechanics (like the wacky spell system) let down by awful voice acting, subpar graphics and a lazy combat system. Very disappointing, should have learned after the first game. ... fool me twice, I guess.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The much improved sequel to the near universally hated Two Worlds makes a glorious comeback in a giant open world RPG that' just fun to play. be it firing multiple arrows at once, Legalas/Hawkeye style, to assassinating grom from behind silently, to charging in with a spear and knocking enemies around, the game's fun. The creaton system for armors and weapons let you truly make each piece of equipment your own, and the spell crafting system let's you make cirtually any spell you can dream.

												I played Two Worlds (one) on the Xbox360 years ago.  I was bored waiting for Elder Scrolls Online to come out and I picked this title up on the off-chance it was better than the 1st one (and I recall the first one being fun).The $20 spent is well worth it.  It truely is an ""open world"" sandbox type game.  There is an underlying story (which is very well done), but if you just want to run off and explore, its fun and possible.The game runs in full HD and is very visually stunning.  I especially like the late afternoons and the way the sunligh interacts with trees and shadows.  Fans od Dragon's Dogma (another highly underrated title from Capcom) and Skyrim will be very satisfied with this title.  I honestly find it mre fun than Skyrim, though Two Wrolds has none of the ""community support"" of a Skyrim.I highly recommend this game for ""out-of-box"" experience, and it just gets better.  Can't wait to pllay the ""pirate add-on"" that I got with the ""Velvet Edition""Tips:  1. Print the english portion of the manual found in the \SteamApps\common\Two Worlds II folder.2. PLAY in DX10 mode (choose as the opening dialog box)Open in pdf reader and print JUST pages 25-40 (for english) .  I played for a while before I discovered this.  There is no keyboard reference under options menu to reference.PROS: Great graphice and animations (PLAY in DX10 mode)game engine beautiful and diversenon-linear with exception of the main story lineupgrades (weapons and armor), crafting, gambling, sailing, customizable magic system, horseback riding, and many other things to do besides ""kill-grind-kill"" (what other game lets you play a guitar?)Has some co-op multiplayer (though I haven't tried it yet).CONS:It's not Elder Scrolls online (j/k)a few of the actions require ""click here to confirm"" actions which is a bit tiresome.Enemy AI can be fooled to seperate enemy packs by running away to ""thin the herd"" before killing individually.Archery ""auto targeting"" can be frustrating			",200,23,9,37,25,1,34

												I have virtually no playtime on this game on PC, but I've extensively played this game on console. It wasn't my favourite game, but I did have fun on it. The PC version, as with most games, seems to be far superior, and I'd highly recommend picking this up for a good time, especially multiplayer.On a side note, this game is nothing special and should be acknowledged as such, but is a great game to play with friends; this game is worth it at 75% off, so pick it up!

												Surprisingly pleasant.  While it may appear to be a Diablo clone it is far from it.  The combat is in-depth (far from a click fest) and the magic system is one of the very best I have ever seen (if not the very best).  The customization of melee choices and magical choices, with the combat, multiplayer, AND ability to build a village of my own puts this close to, if not above, Skyrim. ",53,13,0,30,11,0,30

												A massive improvement over the original Two Worlds. Melee combat doesn't quite have the same feeling of impact as other games and it's slightly unbalanced(get a polearm and you win). Magic is where this game truly shines; mix and match effect and delivery cards to make spells, mix spells to get cooler spells, make yourself a floating shield of garbage. A good game to hold people over til Skyrim comes out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had not played the first Two Worlds but the second one is great. I needed a decent RPG and Two Worlds 2 gave me that. Main character's cast is great and also other NPC's are awesome too, especially Dar Pha. The story and campaigne system is well built but the side quests aren't so. Nearly all of the side quests consist of slaying monsters, thats all. So, after the first chapter the side quest start to become boring.The soundtracks of hte game are great but in lots of situations the music unexpectedly stops immediately on you have to play game without music, it is really not cool. The RPG elements are scarce but since I'd love Gothic series, Two Worlds 2 gave me what I wanted.If you are searcing a little one-way RPG but great action you should try Two Worlds 2 (but I can not the say the same for the DLC, hence other than the ending it's complete waste of time).

												Two Worlds II is a solid, if a bit generic, single person RPG.  I have seen comparisons to Skyrim/Elder Scrolls games and will say that I think that is somewhat of an unfair bar with which to compare it.  I played the original Two Worlds and found this to retain some of the nice features of the original (making all materials usable, the ability  to tailor weapons to work best against specific foes) while dumping some of the lesser features (the horse combat, which, while a neat idea, never worked well). The ability to tailor the character skills to my style of play was a definite plus to the game, allowing me to make the character I wanted as opposed to following a class type.  The main storyline was decent, but the side quests, while sometimes fun, were rather generic.I found the exploration in this game to be rather limited.  Although there were several places the hero could go immediately, there wasn't much to discover at each location.  I was also somewhat disappointed to find that the last island, while seemingly huge on the map, was very limited in where the character could go.I actually found the Pirates of the Flying Fortress expansion to be more enjoyable than the main game.  Although the gameplay was very similar, I felt the plot that was more absorbing for me (perhaps it is my deep-seated longing to be a pirate of old).  The humor was great and the side quests seemed more engrossing than the main game.All in all, I can recommend this game when purchased at a discount for someone who is looking for something familiar and somewhat generic to waste a bit of time and follow a story.  I would recommend against it for someone looking for a cutting edge game that has something new (or, had something new 3 years ago).			",6,1,0,18,1,0,6

												I'll admit that I didn't even make my way out of the starting area before being put off.  The entire game world felt wooden; awkwardly imposed cut scenes and voice acting, being restricted to a 'demo version' unless I 'registered' the game with personal details and a slight swaying of the camera when the PC runs (I've never been sea-sick before, but I'd imagine this game will cause nausea in some).  Maybe they take more time to accustom to, but the controls also seemed iffy: I tried jumping from a staircase, but had to try a few times before managing to succeed. Seeing the positive reviews on here there's probably more to this game, but there's something about two worlds that just makes me want to hate it; right down to the big bad who's outraged by his prisoner escaping, but is too busy to walk over and stop it.  Maybe if I'm bored some day I'll give it another shot, but I certainly wouldn't recommend anyone purchase the game.Edit: maybe it was an intentional part of the tutorial/escape sequence, but the AI seemed awful.  I was chased by a swarm of guards, then ran back past them a few times.  None of them could attack me unless I stood still.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After 24 hrs here is my thoughts....Pros: Nice to look at. Open world, large open enviroments to explore.Magic system is interesting.Crafting is simple and effective.Has a good dose of humour.It doesnt make things too easy - you can stumble into places and get a shock (reminded of Morrowind a bit)Cons:Melee combat isnt great. You can play a melee (in fact i am cos i just dont do mages) but you feel like your thrashing about more than tactically fighting. Once you learn that you can easily get behind larger beasties it gets easier.Some of the resistances on mobs are not obvious (dunno if im just missing something but the manual tells you sod all ).After 24hrs i still dont know what some of the stats on weapons mean. Nothing in the manual.Basically, its a pretty good solid action rpg with a nice world and decent visuals. If some of the finer points were more obvious, ie stats it would be better but this is not going to ruin the game.If you enjoy the likes of Skyrim and you see this in a sale then for sub £5 you will get alot of gameplay and some decent RPG hack n slash.

												Two Worlds 2 is Awesome. The gameplay is awesome, the ranking system is awesome, and the character classes are awesome. But one thing you must know before you get this game, is that this game is a German game, and believe me the Germans on Two Worlds 2 are RACIST and by racist i mean SUPER DUPER DUPER RACIST. So be careful cause they will ban you, if and when they want for no reason what so ever. That is all i have to say.			",26,1,1,3,2,0,0

												This game is a mechanical disaster. Almost none of the actual design elements are working. Starting with the dull combat which is even worse than it was in the Gothic and Risen series. The pointlessly simple lockpicking mechanism. The awful ui and inventory system. Crafting is one of the things which are actually useable. Graphics-wise the TW2 is decent, it runs well. The world itself while a generic run of the mill fantasy setting, contains a few interesting locations. Dialogs are uninteresting. Quest tracker is hard to use.The game has many faults in my eyes, but the worst is the combat. Amalur had similar issues with dialogs, quest tracking and world, still it had great combat. That one aspect made it a great game. RPGs often prioritize story, exploration, progression above combat, which is good, but you still have to offer a decent fighting mechanism because it is what you are going to do half the time. I can hardly think any of those respected rpgs which have a really good combat system. The second Two Worlds is neither a decent rpg or an enjoyable fighting game.			",781,315,39,103,83,8,123

												Surprisingly pleasant.  While it may appear to be a Diablo clone it is far from it.  The combat is in-depth (far from a click fest) and the magic system is one of the very best I have ever seen (if not the very best).  The customization of melee choices and magical choices, with the combat, multiplayer, AND ability to build a village of my own puts this close to, if not above, Skyrim. ",53,13,0,30,11,0,30

												Even though I only have 0.7 hours, I played for quite a bit on PS3. And I put in a looot of time into Two Worlds.This game is like having to truly love that fat girl for her personality, and not care that shes a whale. Jokes aside, they improved a lot and this game has a lot of things other games dont do. You can do things like infiintely upgrade a weapon, so if you like the look of a certain weapon but its one of the early beginner weapons..you can just keep upgrading it. You can make your own spells, and you can come up with all sorts of crazy spell combinations. I was watching videos of people with their spells, some guy made a killer AoE spell, another guy made a spell that summoned like 20 golems. You can dye your armour, so that everything matches. Like when you find two armor pieces that would look good together but they dont, because completely different colors. As for the whole liking the fat girl for personality comparison..Games terribly optimized. Character models look bland. Animations look terribly awkward. Voice acting is terrible, as well as the dialogue. And the one thing I hated the most about the previous entry, NOTHING EVER RESPAWNS. By the time you build this crazy insane guy up, theres not much left to test him out on. And everything you do test him out on, well that leaves one less enemy in the world. There is co op that you could do this on, but do I really want to run through the same stages over and over and over again doing the same stuff? They shouldve just made the co op a free roam adventure.Overall, I wouldnt recommend this game. Too many things to look past. But if you dont mind all these things, then get it.			",140,12,8,9,9,0,9

												Read this review with the thought in your head that I am reviewing in 2017, 6 years after the release of the game, and have recieved the game for free. In all honesty, this game was completely overshadowed by the graphics, gameplay and storyline of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Also released in 2011, Skyrim got all the attention because of it's vast world and extensive storyline. Two Worlds II doesn't have an open world, and more of a single dedicated storyline. The first Two Worlds game was also a pice of junk in all honesty, so I didn't expect much at all from this game. As a second point, 20 dollars is WAY too much to ask for this game right now, but I think $1.99 is a ""Fair"" Price. This is worth checking out if you want terrible game to find glitches in and mock it's ""terrible"" graphics by today's standards. If you have gotten it FOR FREE, why not give it a try. But if you haven't, DON'T pay 20 dollars for this, get Skyrim for 5 dollars on sale.			",377,87,12,67,43,8,58

												What should have been a good game is ruined by a defective copy protection system, (why did they even bother putting it on steam then?) occaisionally it bugs out and demands you re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-enter your serial number.. on top of that, when it demands the serial number, it also re-demands that you register.. which if you already registered .. will fail. On the other hand if you manage to login past the stupid protection, the game is ok to play with passable graphics. Just dont log out until you beat it or get sick of it, or you may have to re-enter your serial YET AGAIN and if you get your registration info wrong the second time dont expect to be playing it very much...Ironically I read an article indicating there was a no-cd hack made for this that removed the serial check, and fixed some other game breaking bugs too. The orignal makers of the game couldn't do this for the steam version... why exactly? Who knows. But they lost my respect as a result.			",59,11,4,6,8,0,1

												10/10 the game it self its awsome.  The dlc  pirates of the flying fortress realy up'd the graphics,  its is a totaly rpg and sort of an mmo mixed. There is a lot of swearing in game but then again who the hell cares the armor is realy nice the weaponds are awsome its is a very long game well at least the dlc  very nice fighting and pve i not tride pvp yet but the magic i think might be over powerd in that. there is blood wich is nice voice and sounds are amazing. the boss are hard to fight.. but this is a all class around game meaning  u can use weaponds from othere class even if ur not that pacific class.

												I put a ridiculous amount of time into this terribly mediocre game. The magic system is interesting for sure, but the melee and ranged are complete crap. They had some good ideas for the game, but none of them really came through as far as I can tell. They're just barely on the cusp of something truly mind-blowing.Better than most crap out there.7 / 12			",721,226,15,79,62,10,111

												Recieved this game from a website in the form of a random Steam key. I can honestly say I was a bit disappointed, but the trading cards aren't bad so I managed to farm my drops on the loading screen and level the badge up to level 3. That being said I never actually played the game, so I'm just gonna give it a positive rating considering it's doing poorly anyways.			",66,8,0,6,3,0,2

												Even though I only have 0.7 hours, I played for quite a bit on PS3. And I put in a looot of time into Two Worlds.This game is like having to truly love that fat girl for her personality, and not care that shes a whale. Jokes aside, they improved a lot and this game has a lot of things other games dont do. You can do things like infiintely upgrade a weapon, so if you like the look of a certain weapon but its one of the early beginner weapons..you can just keep upgrading it. You can make your own spells, and you can come up with all sorts of crazy spell combinations. I was watching videos of people with their spells, some guy made a killer AoE spell, another guy made a spell that summoned like 20 golems. You can dye your armour, so that everything matches. Like when you find two armor pieces that would look good together but they dont, because completely different colors. As for the whole liking the fat girl for personality comparison..Games terribly optimized. Character models look bland. Animations look terribly awkward. Voice acting is terrible, as well as the dialogue. And the one thing I hated the most about the previous entry, NOTHING EVER RESPAWNS. By the time you build this crazy insane guy up, theres not much left to test him out on. And everything you do test him out on, well that leaves one less enemy in the world. There is co op that you could do this on, but do I really want to run through the same stages over and over and over again doing the same stuff? They shouldve just made the co op a free roam adventure.Overall, I wouldnt recommend this game. Too many things to look past. But if you dont mind all these things, then get it.			",140,12,8,9,9,0,9

												Honestly, I can't say that this game is all bad. It did have it's moments (I bought it for console originally so I have about 50ish hours logged there as compared to here). But, long story short: If you want a game that is a full release yet feels like an alpha release, be my guest and buy it. Otherwise, don't. The controls are a bit odd and hard to get used to. The dialog is, quite frankly, stiff and unemotional (especially for an RPG). And while this game may add some very cool concepts to the gaming industry, it does not deliver as it should. Oh, and don't even get me started on the tutorial that takes around an hour (or more) for most people. And that most of the ""map"" is completely unavaliable for you to play on (and I mean the non-tutorial actual game map). Overall, it is not worth a buy. Not even on sale. But, if you want to, buy the game and see for yourself. As I said earlier, I have 50ish hours of this game logged into my console. It's an interesting romp in a strangely unfinished world. This game HAD real potential. I only wish that it was fulfilled.4/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What a rotten, zero ethics , bunch of dirt bags the developers of this game are, literally one of the few games out there forcing players to activate and prove they bought the game, I bought the game, but every time I buy a new PC or reset mine I have to do it all over again. And now it's saying I've activated it on too many systems,(one pc and a couple of Windows tablets, I upgrade to better devices often) but guess what? That's the beauty of Steam! I should be able to play my library on any PC I want! Also if you didn't treat your fans like criminals maybe you'd be more successful? Go to he!! Two Worlds 2 developers.

												Barely get through learning the mechanics and the game locks up the whole system failing to play a cut scene and you can't go further.  That's a pretty big fail, no idea how people have played this game.  Maybe it can't handle new hardware or something.  Whatever the case, it's a dead stick.  No wait, Google tells me this has been broken since day one and never fixed, you have to remove the videos from the game to make it fail past them?  And there are tons of other such problems?  Wow... nope, not dealing with that.			",94,11,0,16,6,0,32

												Used to play this on Xbox 360 when it first came out. My buddies and I were in high school at the time, and while very messy, the first game had a certain charm to it.... we all bought the game and spent hours and hours in the multiplayer, forming our own little guild and buying a village and pooling our resources for it's upkeep while getting our sh** pushed in by the overpowered monsters that would threaten it at times.... I had so much fun with this game and for those who give it a chance, it is a great title and lots of fun to play, both multiplayer and singleplayer...... however...I refuse to recommend this game on steam when it wont even start. I looked up many, many solutions to this instant crash on startup. I was met with endless replies of ""can someone recommend a different method, because this didnt work for me...""No matter how fun a game is, I will never recommend it if you have to spend hours trying to jump through hoops just so it MIGHT work... I loved it on 360, and if you have one laying around, give it a try... but do not purchase it for the PC. It's broken as hell and it confuses me why comapnies are allowed to release things that do not work, like this....  tl;drConsole version = Play it!PC = Waste of time and money as it wont even start. Save your money.One of very, very few benefits of console gaming, I guess. ",31,8,0,18,0,0,0

												This game is one of the best games i ever played,but there is a short main line.                                                                                                                                                                      Main line is very funny,you can play it 10-20hours in a row.                                                            You can play multiplayer too and its awesome!			",294,55,6,41,25,5,44

												Two Worlds II is worth it's wait in gold. This is the game that Oblivion should have been. Fantastic cutscenes, expansive areas to explore, real animals to kill. No more there being only deer, boar, & bears. You can fight a wide variety of enemies, not just animals, but also creatures that you wished were in other games. The leveling is incredibly fun and custimizable. Your enemies do not level up with you, but rather you can enter an area where you will easily die, making this game just as it should be: a real RPG.			",52,0,0,7,4,1,15

												This game has a really good magic system, a creative storyline, a freeform character building system, a fairly nice crafting system...And as long as you don't play the last chapter, a really good game! The game is amazing, weaves an interesting and complex plot that build up towards an amazing apex.... but right before you reach it, it does a stupid twist, and instead of wrapping up in a nice neat bow, just creates a thousand plot holes. Honeslty... get the game, enjoy the game, but stop and go get wrapped up in a different game before going into the final chapter (the return to gandahar's castle). That's the way you'll enjoy it most.			",291,88,1,54,63,4,66

												What an absolutely putrid game. Horrible, non-intuitive design (eg lockpicking....and absolutely arcane, impossibly difficult task from the VERY BEGINNING)., no freedom to explore worlds at one's leisure or pace....relentless battles which become repetitive and tedious. No guidance on how to advance in quests. A real piece of trash. Why did people ever play this worthless garbage? Artwork sucks. Music sucks. Gameplay sucks. Complete lack of help or instructions. The designers of this wreck are criminals for taking money for this filth.			",19,11,1,7,0,0,4

												This RPG has many flaws, but I kind of ignored them. Why? Because it's really immersive, great music and the environments are amazing. Plus the water / wave physics are pretty cool. I solely played this game to explore around and enjoy the world.If you're like me, get this game, but beware of silly voice acting, funky animations (that running..) and probably just an average RPG in the greater scheme of things. Still for me this was just really immersive, and I love immersive games. ^^			",180,44,4,38,18,2,16

												I've played about an hour, but this game feels like an early beta, but has been out for a long time.From what I've played, here's what I've found:Pors:~ Was on sale for $3 (luckily or I'd've returned it by now)~ Good 3D graphics for its time~ Cut scenes are decent~ Voice acting isn't too badCons:~ Horrible and ugly UI; looks like it was made for a 1995 game~ Requires full name and address to register game even after the CD key is input, otherwise it only allows demo play~ Opening inventory unequipts everything equipted~ Combat system is meh~ Super linear world, definately not fun for Elder Scrolls fans, but maybe okay for Dark/Demon Souls/Boodborne fans~ Poor AI, friendly and enemy~ Character customization is bad; I made him (only males can be made) tall, but it kept his lower arms short and tiny hands so he looked like a T-rex forever			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The first one was shockingly bad and this one is a little better but not by much. The makers of the two worlds series have a very very long way to go before they are in the tripple A zone. The voice acting is akin to something you would see in B movies from the 60's, The combat looks like something a modder came up with.The games only plus side has to be the graphics, To look at it's quite pretty but thats where it ends, If you value your money then do not buy this rubbish.

After the painfully long intro and god awful animations were over, I got out and almost immeadiately after another mentally damaging cutscene appears and it breaks, (NO ♥♥♥♥ING SUPRISE THERE HM?). This game makes me want to go outside. I would rather go outside and walk around town, than play this game. I paid just under £1 for this game and I feel cheated for my money. I could of gone out and bought a bag of Haribo's and found more enjoyment out of it than a computer program that is meant to keep you entertained. 10/10 Caused severe bowel cancer			",54,2,0,4,4,0,5

												Game sucks major♥♥♥♥♥♥hole. Admins think you're hacking when you're not. Then they reset you and give you a warning. Then you go play for a while and later when you try to login you are banned for 3 months. After waiting 3 months your account got reset and you can start all over again. And the gameplay sucks. Even Roblox is more fun. i r8 0/420 m8 nau i go sk8 cuz i haz h8.			",118,21,2,16,11,1,6

												This game is ♥♥♥♥ing horrible. How it got a 75 average on metacritic or any reviews above a 20 are beyond me. And no, I'm not dumb enough to buy it, it came in a bundle I bought for something else. Its combat is some of the worst, most unfun, embarassingly bad combat that I have ever seen in a game. Ever. The combat is so bad that it is comical and is unbelievably generic with no substance at all. The combat is like something two college kids would program for a indie game that is aimed at parodying other third-person rpg games. This is not real. This is a laughably bad imitation of much better games.In actuality I want to send a letter of thank you to this games developers. I have so many games I need to play/finish, around 90+ installed, that I was hoping that this game would suck so I could just uninstall it and get back to my other good games. So thank you devs. I don't have to worry about having another good game to play through.			",598,87,12,48,22,5,43

												As politely as I can say this... this game is just awful. The mawovement and combat are way too wonky feeling, I couldn't even figure out how to heal myself. The game looks awful too, which wouldn't be a problem if the controls weren't equally as bad. I can't even recommend this game on sale, it's not worth the $3 dollars. This game might be fun with a friend just to poke fun at, but even that would get old fast. 3/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just.... Wow. If you wanted a game that would make you lose all the faith you had left in humanity.. Then this is the game for you. Awful combat, Overly complex mechanics, bad graphics, awful animation, Metacritic was way off with their score. 76/100? I might maybe give it a 35/100. I got it on sale for $4.74, not worth it. Probably the dumbest part of this game is how it made me sit and fill out some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ nonsense just so I could play the game. This is a steam game! Why on earth do I need to put in a CD key. This game and all who were involved in its creation need to be jettisoned into the darkest pit of the void. If this game was food it would be equal to eating wood chips and washing it down with toilet water. If you are thinking of getting this gods forsaken catastrophe then please, save your money. If you are determined to do something with it then please just toss it in the river. At least then you won't have to go through the mental trauma that this game can cause.

												Got this game on sale, which I'm happy about.  Graphics and voice acting aren't great, and neither is combat.  There's a fair bit of different RPG mechanics, but the fact that they're still explaining them after over an hour of playtime is ridiculous.  There's not too much character customization either, and you're stuck with playing a male character (sorry ladies).  This may also be the only game where the provided CD key is actually asked for, and you're required to register with the (I assume defunct) company that made this game.  Nothing special and best if avoided.			",283,69,3,22,10,2,14

												Very complex gameplay, with a story that is very understandable. To enhance the excessive visual cutscenes, they do not include subtitles. They know the best fit for most gamers who are playing the game, as they strongly advise to listen to the dialogue and they strongly yet secretly take away the subtitles option. Here's a quick ""snippet"" of the dialogue:Rolinrdirrearfear: ""[insert some wierd latin name], you need 2 git sum steeel.""Me: aight. wait wher cun i find steeelRhhhlifnskfdir (same character, just ilustrating the complex names u kno): u cun get it in teh hasdhf dshjfaldinir.Me: wait tf lol wher iz it thoRblahblahblahdir: you can get it in the (didnt know what he said) where u crush it n stufSpeech choices at that point: 1. wait tf lol wher iz it tho2. k kool c ya Very exciting.Oh, the gameplay, you say? you want to know what the gameplay is like?Picture this in your mind: Skyrim on aids makes a baby with Dark Souls, which has dyslexia and ADHD. The result: Two Worlds II, aka Skyrim and Dark Souls's baby, which has genetic aids mixed with dyslexia and ADHD. very depressing.Its like if John Cena had no muscles. he would still be beautiful (no homo), but he wouldn't be that effective on getting the job done.enjoy.

												Review as of 10/1/2016:Had to update this review due to comments about me not mentioning the singleplayer. I never touched the singleplayer due to a friend of a friend trying to convince me to buy it because it was so cheap and he referred to it as an MMO. I am sure the singleplayer is where the game ""shines,"" but the combat style that I experienced in multiplayer I would assume is exactly the same in the singleplayer as the multiplayer.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Do not buy this game. Yes it is on sale for very cheap, which is extremely appealing, but do not do it. The multiplayer is the strangest broken mess I have ever seen in a game. Trying to play with about 8 people and after 20 minutes of trying to figure out how to actually leave the starting area of the server, one of my friends finally figures out how to actually play a quest, but sadly only me and him could play it. The combat is decent I guess. The inventory system is very laggy and can be confusing at times. I do not recommend this game at all. I am honestly surprised the devs have kept the servers going for this game.			",158,20,5,14,35,3,17

												The graphics are ok but the controls are very bad. Also the menus only have a few options visible at once and force you to scroll to see the rest, but it doesn't scroll smoothly. The intro movie is unskippable and the game wants your name, address, sex, etc before it lets you play.The graphics are quite bad in places and the rest is just plain bad.If the game was easy to play, the graphics and stilted acting wouldn't be so bad, but the controls hinder you at every turn and its difficult to get past the menus and intros to just play the game.Overall, I give it a 3 as there may be an ok game hidden in there somewhere.Unfortunately, it's no 'Skyrim'.

After making a character, my person immediately lifts a barrel, chucks it into my knees, and i die. can't load a saved game cuz i just started, so my only option was to go back to character creation and make a new person. First game was bad, and this is no better. If you never played a good game before i suggest you get this game. but for those who have played good games before, please reconsider.

												If you want to buy this game,ok just do it but play single player ONLY,DON'T TRY MP!!Cos admin can delete your character/clear your acc information freely,if a newbie have much money,he must have been cheated to have the money,what a ridiculous logic!My girlfriend played MP 7 hours+ everyday for a time,and made a lot of efforts to earn the money,then she traded the money to me,it CAUSED THAT I have much money,but I'm just a newbie,SO I CHEATED TO HAVE THE MONEY!!The admin must get sh!t in brainADMIN RUIN THE GAME!This is why TW2 has such few players.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------			",29,10,0,2,2,0,1

												Horible game. Stroy appears to be written by a 12 year old. Voice overs are HORRIBLE. UI is HORRIBLE. Controls are HORRILBE. There is nothing good about this game. I bought this game to kill time till Shadows of Mordor came out and i regreat buying it.If i could get my 4$ back and had the choice to spend it on this game again or paying an old day hooker to beat the crap out of me, i would go with the later without a second thought.

												(WARNING BAD ENGLISH GRAMMAR)It has a really bad acc making,you need to give everything phone,addres,zipcode.And the phone acc making is so bad.I speend more money on phone acc making then on this game (spennd on game at one website  0,80 EUR spend trying to make acc on phone around 3 EUR) And at the end i didnt make acc using phone.OK i made the freaking acc now to the game gameplay isn´t so bad.I enjoy the fighting, but the inventory is bad.Story it´s ok, the dialogues are sometime so long they could explain it faster and in less dialogue,animations are sometimes strange.!!! THIS GAME ISN´T BAD BUT I DON´T RECOMMEND IT IF YOU ARE NO´T HARDCORE RPG PLAYER!!! U CAN BUY IT PLAY IT FOR 30-90 MIN IF U DON´T LIKE IT GET A REFUND THE GAME 4/10 (THIS IS JUST MY THOUGHT) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												meh. at first i was impressed, it looks great. the story seemed like it could be interesting. but then the main character started speaking more. his personality, or lack thereof, turned me off this game. that and the long open areas of nothing but like 3-5 re-spawning scripted enemies, makes this game a boring, albeit pretty romp through the woods. the gameplay itself isnt too bad, but inventory management gets a bit hectic, and youll end up ditching stuff thats pretty good alot, or holding onto crap you cant use for like 4 hours.

												Started the game, spent 20 minutes creating a character, watched intro cutscene. Walked 10 steps down a hall, picked up a barrel, then dropped it. Barrel's physics glitched and it killed me. Pressed ""Load Save"", game didn't save after character creation. Quit.Personal rating: ♥♥♥♥ you\10(Had played it before and it's actually a good game - but seriously, ♥♥♥♥ that barrel.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
