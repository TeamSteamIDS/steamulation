												I think many that level bad scores and a list of complaints at Mass Effect 2 have fallen into the trap of looking at games purely as a collection of mechanics. Sure, it's another cover shooter, which taken alone is merely decent. They're right that the RPG elements are simple and at times are obtuse and too black and white. You can, at least partially, break the upgrade system by grinding resource collection. Given all that it would seem there is no reason to even play this game but you'd be wrong. This game, and the whole series, is trying to be more than just mindless entertainment. It's trying to to tell a deep, rich story, trying to get you to really care about it's characters, and it's trying to get you to think beyond the mechanics, beyond the game even. By no means is this just a story with some game attached, but the story and how your decisions effect it and it's characters are a huge part of this game.When you play this game, because to be clear, you should play it, I would urge you to try and actually role play the choices. This game brings up some pretty serious issues in some of it's choices. Issues that should stop and make you think, not just about how this will effect your game but about how you would actually feel about this in your everyday life. You can always go back and play it again and make all the ""good"" or ""bad"" choices but at least once you should really put yourself in Cmd. Sheppard's shoes, make the choices you would be comfortable making outside the game. Don't worry about what the game says your moral score is, play it to learn something about yourself.

												I recommend the game--just not as a digital download. The buying options on Steam are misleading (I don't think this is Steam's fault, I believe it is more of an issue with how Bioware chose to package their content); Buying the ""Digital Deluxe Edition"" DOES NOT include ALL in-game content. NONE of the DLCs are packaged into the ""Digital Deluxe Edition."" And NONE of the DLC is purchasable on Steam. This is NOT readily apparent unless you carefully read the description on Steam. Furthermore, to access the alleged extras in this DDE version, you must make a Bioware account, find the proper pages, download the alleged extras manually, and install manually before you can play them. I originally played ME 2 on PS3, having bought a disk edition that had all the DLCs included. That is your best bet for this game unfortunately. If you buy the digital download, by the time you have all the content (vanilla game + DLCs) you will be sinking WAY more money into Bioware's money grubbing hands then this 6+ year old game is worth.

												I would give both my legs for the chance to play this franchise for the first time again. No other game has moved me in such a way that mass effect has. It is just. Unbelievable. I have 42 playthroughs, one being on pc, the others being on my 360. This game is the best game I have ever had the pleasure of playing. And I can't thank Bioware enough for such a beautiful ride.Then we get to mass effect 3. EA, you complete wankstains. You endorse good games, (I'm EA Games, and this is a game to ruin on the internet) and you help produce them wonderfuly, until it gets to the end sequence, then your money instincs kick in and you want it finished in an unfinished state. So for that, ♥♥♥♥ you. But apart from that, if you're considering buying this wonderful franchise. Do yourself a lemon and buy all 3 on Origin. All 3 games in one place. I hope you all enjoy the beautiful ride as much as I have. >I have a poster of Garrus framed on my wall. The only poster I own.If only I could press the recommend button more than once.

												Did you know there’s a game where you can come back from death, blow up prisons, take on three factions of mercenaries, deal with wars between species, survive a Suicide Mission and get in a relationship with the hot alien you want? Nominated as the best game of the generation, winning 150 awards of Game of the Year of 2010 and building so much hype that its sequel couldn’t be more than disappointing, Mass Effect 2 is a game you have to play.      Even if you didn’t play the first one, you won’t be left in the dark, people will tell you what’s the deal and the codex has all the extra details. If you played the first one, then you’ll enjoy the fact that your choices carry over and have some weight on what’s happening.      The combat involves 3rd person camera, using your class specific abilities and guns and giving commands to your squadmates and it has an interface made for PC. There are 6 classes and each of them are varied enough for every playthrough to feel like a fresh experience. Some are more power based, other weapon focused, but all of them do damage and are awesome and you’ll definitely find your type, whether you like to make shockwaves in the enemy lines, hack the robots, pull them in a singularity, cloak yourself and shoot them in the back or simply slow down time to shoot them while they wonder what’s happening with them. There are difficulties that vary from casual from insanity, so whether you play games for their story or want to dominate the dominators, you’ll find what you want. 


Game Over; for them

 Many will say the story is great. I say it’s a good one, but that its characters make it to be one of the best. 80% of it you recruit team members and gain their loyalty(only if you want to). They all prove themselves to be interesting and you’ll have enough dialogue options to find out what makes them tick. On your ship, there is going to be the hyperactive mad(ish) scientist, the hot secretary, the crazy all powerful ♥♥♥♥♥, the assassin with regrets, the best friend who took a rocket in his face and is 99% of the time in the middle of some calibrations, a lizard hulk who calles himself “Grunt”, the gun expert that does 663 abs each day,  the cute engineer whose face you’ll never see and some more. You’ll have the options to get involved in their lives. Some of them will argue and you’ll be the one to settle the conflict. Depending on your gender, some of them are available and open to ideas. 


Now I am motivated to go into the Suicide Mission 
A Screenshot of Mass Effect 2

The last mission a.k.a. The Suicide Mission is what makes everything in the game pay off. It’s the place where the catharsis is unleashed. The place where your love for this game will be cemented.  Whatever you’ve done, there will be consequences and by that time, you’ll care.  If you’ll fail hard, you’ll cry hard. But if you’ve upgraded the ship and made the smart choices throughout the game and in the last minutes, you’ll be overjoyed and feel like you’ve won 1 million dollars.  All in all, Mass Effect  2 is a great experience, when you’ll play it you’ll live your second life, one where you’re saving the galaxy you enjoy being into.

												If you havent played the original Mass Effect, this game is still a must play. You wont be lost as to whats going on, as long as you check out the codex section on the in-game menu. This game is AMAZING and the story line, voice acting, graphics and overall gameplay are all impressive. This game is ahead of its time, dont miss it.From the ominous opening music, until the final decisions through the Omega-4 Relay are made, the perfection builds every step of the way. Sure, there are many cinematic games that play like a novel and are fantastic but Ive never been pulled into a game with a ""need to play"" like ME2 has done.The diversity of the characters and backstory make you feel as if this universe has been developed for a long, long time, and you are only now being introduced to it. The characters make you care about them with their depth, and this increases moreso as the game goes on. I've never experienced anything like it, and Bioware really set the bar with dialogue and character interaction. The ""choices' you are given never feel like lines from a bad movie, like so many games, but are believable and accurate to the story and what you intended to say.The game itself is an exciting RPG/3rd Person Shooter. When you start you can choose from a few classes. Some are excellent at biotic powers and some are just for shooting things the old fashion way. I chose soldier and because of that I had very little biotic powers. I could slow down time but that's about it. The biotic side of the game for me was my crew mates. You level them up along with yourself when you gain squad points. As you add skill points to a skill it becomes stronger until you reach full potential then you have two versions of it to choose from. The gunplay in the beginning of the game was a little boring but it became really fun once you were able to upgrade and get new versions of your weapons. That added a lot of depth to the combat. There are also different types of ammo to use that increases your weapons attributes. Nothing is more satisfying then freezing an enemy an watching them implode.When a game ropes you in, like this one did for me, and creates that yearning to play, the developer has done their job. This game plays like an epic film, but one that creates a universe that I think is on par with any of the great space-epic movies and tv series, and that alone is something. This game is a pivotal point for me in regards to gaming, and it has changed the way I will evaluate and appreciate all games in the future.Simply put, one of the best game I've ever played...

""They tell me it's a suicide mission. I intend to prove them wrong.” I still have vivid memories how, on that fateful day in 2010, the delivery truck pulled up at my home with this game deep within. No ordinary truck, this one was holy white, and the gold delivery logo sparkled like a thousand suns, reflected through shards of the purest ice formed with unadulterated water collected at the beginning of the universe. The driver, clad in a robe, coloured in the softest and purest white I have ever laid eyes upon, floated towards me on a cool fog of a hundred fire extinguishers. He smiled benevolently, like a father looking down upon his only child, and handed me a package wrapped in gold, beaten thin to the point where you could see through it. As I touched the package, our eyes met and my soul was filled with an unearthly serenity, never felt before in my short and humble life. Suddenly we were standing in space, surrounded by the debris of countless destroyed ships and asteroids. At the far distance was a gigantic black hole and I knew with every fibre of body, that this was the destination I had to reach to fulfil my mission. The next moment we were back on Earth, and I did not have to sign, because this angelic being could see within my heart, and knew that – as paragon of the good – I was pure. Upon opening the package, an angelic choir started to sing, and reached a crescendo as I placed the DVD into the drive of my PC. Instantly, my antiquated equipment transformed into the latest state of the art technical marvel. The game knew where to go, and installed itself within a blink of an eye into the right folder without any help from me – all the while, the choir sang praises to the almighty digital god. With trepidation, I clicked on the ‘play the game’ button, and was instantly immersed in one of the most impressive action role-playing games I have ever played, with a brilliant atmosphere and memorable companions, all within the framework of a fantastic science fiction setting.Amusing quotes:“It's so much easier to see the world in black and white. Gray? I don't know what to do with gray.”“Have killed many, Shepard. Many methods. Gunfire, knives, drugs, tech attacks, once with farming equipment. But not with medicine!”“What could I possibly be suggesting? I mean, a young woman gets rescued by a dashing commander who lets her join his crew and then goes off to save the galaxy? How could she possibly develop any kind of interest in him?”“Doesn't matter who you are - you got a gun in your face, chances are good you'll do what the other man says. Only two types don't buckle at that point: trained killers and psychopaths. Lot of people can't tell the difference.”Achievements:The game has no Steam achievements.

												Compared to Mass Effect 1, Mass Effect 2 is equally as amazing. It lost a little bit of the RPG feeling, however, with the combat improvements, it makes up for it greatly. The cover system is a lot better and the skills are just a lot easier to use, especially when it comes to the squadmates. The player would just have to press Q or E to make that specific squatmate use a power. The music is stunning, as always. If you like Star Wars KOTOR or anything made by BioWare, you will love Mass Effect. 10/10""Report to the ship ASAP. We'll bang, okay?""			",107,18,0,14,15,0,9

												Mass Effect 2 is the sequal to one of my favorites, Mass Effect. The second edition to the series is by far the best one I've played yet. There are so many small improvements that made this game even better than the first. I'm not saying the first isn't worth trying at all because it is an awesome story in itself! However, with this sequal I found it to have it's jaw dropping moments and being able to see old faces from the first game and have them in the squad had that awesome old friend feeling that made a deep connection with the game. I loved this sequal and I suggest you give it a try!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mass Effect 2 is an adventure I will never forget.In my personal opinion, Mass Effect 2 is one of the best sci-fi RPGs ever made, the world Bioware created is unique, diverse and wonderful, not to say everyone is hugging eachother while hopping over rainbows.The game presents you with many moral and ethical choices, an exmaple is a mission which requires you to blow up a mass relay, but doing so will destroy a colony with over 300.000 residents, but if you don't do it the system will get invaded by the Reapers. (Giant robots with lasers, you have to play the game to understand.)You truly get to form your own personality in the game, do you assert and be a badass, or do you show compassion and be a hero? as you advance in either direction you unlock new dialogue options and actions, ranging from giving someone a hug to kicking someone out of a window.Every crew member has a very devloped personallity, and you will feel attached to most of them, you can even develop relationships and they aren't limited by species or gender (Sadly, you can't be gay, only lesbian, this confused me a little).You can do them personal favors to make them loyal to you, increasing your chance of survining the suicide mission at the end of the game, I have seen some of my beloved crewmembers die in my first playthrough, I was actually crying over the death of a fictional character.But Mass Effect is still a game, not a futurustic dating sim, you can choose to skip the romance entirely, and you don't have to recruit certain crew member sif you don't want.The gameplay is solid, sometimes the 'one-button-does-everything' system gets confusing, running, taking cover and interacting with things is all bound to one button, which can lead to confusion sometimes.When you start the game you get to choose a class, some specialize in weapons, others in tech (this means you get to use combat drones, tech to drain shiles and incinerate or freeze enemies from a distance, and others in biotics (space magic, you get to lift people of the ground, or throw them a few feet away or you can spawn tiny black holes), most of these powers are well balanced and satisfying to use, some of them feel a bit silly though. (I'm looking at you, shockwave..)You can explore a lot of different star-systems, you can scan planets for resources and you may just find a secret side-mission, these do feel a bit cheesy sometimes though. (you enter a hidden facility and the merc leader just keeps saying 'you shouldn't have come here, prepare to die').Whenever you investigate a planet you get a little information about it, like the surface temperature, atmospheric pressure, even travel advisory sometimes, and some even have traces of past civillizations who were space-faring long before that fish with legs on earth crawled out of the water to eventually become a monkey.Mass Effect 2's soundtrack is great, the music in the main missions really made me feel like I was in a dire battle to save the galaxy from detruction, the music that plays during the suicide mission is just.. damn, I still get goosebumps from it, it's truly an epic piece.Sadly, Mass Effect does have it's weak-points, as missions can feel a bit repetitive sometimes, hub-worls are smaller than they were in Mass Effect 1 and DLC is obtained in a very annoying way, you have to make a Bioware account and buy Bioware points with real money, these points you can then spend on the DLC, I would prefer to buy DLC directly through steam without using these Bioware points.If you want to play DLC you need to be online when you launch the game, otherwise it simply won't load or show up.There are also a few annoying bugs that never got adressed, sometimes I run into an object and get teleported on-top of it, then I either have to wait until I die or I have to quit to the main menu and then load the save again, sometimes during conversations characters are facing the wrong person or are doing some really weird stuff with their head.Mass Effect 2 is an epic game, and I would reccomend every RPG or Sci-Fi fan to give it a try, there is a whole galaxy full of different races, friends and foes to explore!

												Storywise, there is nothing above this one. The graphics are great. Sound is amazing. I dont't know why these muppets decided to ruin the experience by adding TWO layers of DRM to the game, steam and also the cerberus network which is origin. I was also annoyed by the fact that i had to buy DLC even if i bought the digital deluxe edition...the shadow broker DLC is no longer included and you have to buy it seperately. Overall a great game with a lot of additional DLC that has to be bought for bioware points....jeez. Still, the gaming experience is great and the possibility of importing a savegame from ME1 with gameplay effects from all your previous decisions is marvelous.Recommended for masochistic double DRM dunces who are not afraid to pay extra for DLCs.

												One of the best games of the current decade, perhaps even the best. I've beaten this game countless times before on console and it still feels as fresh and immersive as ever. The character design, the combat, the visuals, the writing; everything is on point.The only downsides there are at the moment is the fact that the DLC isn't available on Steam, and the class balance is a bit wonky. Infiltrator and Sentinel stand head and shoulders above everything else, and Engineer is borderline useless. Outside of these minor issues, there's absolutely nothing wrong with this game in my opinion. Just play it already.			",58,6,0,10,4,0,11

												If you haven't played Mass Effect 1 I suggest you play that before starting this game off.Mass Effect continues with it's breath taking  environments, epic story telling, and great gameplay.Some mechanics have changed from the previous Mass Effect but that is to be expected.I honestly don't want to say to much about this game of fear that it may ruin it for anyone who hasn't played this game yet so all I will say is that the Mass Effect series is a must have for any collection of (Shooter, Role Playing Game, Adventure, or Story Board).

												Play as Commander Shepard on an epic sex craving adventure in space! Make love to a variety of alien women more desirable than our own. Why not purchase a pet hamster when you stop by at the Citadel? Or pick up an alien nudie mag in the Omega markets? Waste precious resources probing Uranus and laugh about it in the process. Accept bribes and utilize drugs during combat. Punch women and bully those inferior than yourself. Drink until you pass out during important mission assignments. Remember to shout-out your badass catchphrase whenever a conversation has gone on long enough: ""I should go."" So profound! Did I forget to mention that your pilot is none other than Seth Green -- he who happens to crack jokes while maintaining a respectable attitude all at the same time? Oh, you can also save the galaxy whenever you're in the mood, there's that too.			",692,151,13,43,51,6,98

												My favourite from the trilogy.+Amazing soundtrack.+Probably the best cast of characters in any ME game, Thane and Garrus being my absolute favourites. ""Killing is an art and i am a master."" How can't you like the lizard with that bad♥♥♥♥♥lizard voice.+Great sidequets, unlike those in the first game which made me want to jump from the 5th floor of my building. No filler and fetch quests here.+Amazing DLC, especially Shadow Broker which is probably the best piece of DLC i played in my life. Arrival is also good, as well as Katsumi story DLC.+Better gunplay than in the first game. +Great replay value (paragon/renegade, diffrent classes, male and female characthers also have some diffrent dialogue options.+Did i mention this game has an amazing bad♥♥♥♥♥lizard (

 BEST. GAME. EVER. EDIT: I never expected for my review to get to the top of the reviews section of ME2 store page, thank you fellow gamers! That's why I'm adding a few more things to it and separating it in sections. English is not my native language so please note that I'll probably have a ton of mistakes here, and I also have a very limited vocabulary. I'm trying my best. Also please note that you'll probably lose more time reading this review than actually playing the game. :)*** **** ****If you played Mass Effect 1, then I'm pretty sure that you'll like this one even better. Also, if you played ME1, you know the story. If you didn't play it, go and play it. NOW. It's a game that everyone should play atleast once in their lives. I could write a review as long as  ""War and Peace""  is about who's your character, what are you up to, what kind of weapons do you have and similar, but still I feel like I just couldn't say everything. This is one of the games you can't experience by just simply reading about it on wikipedia or watching walkthrough videos or reading reviews and deciding is it good enough or not - you just need to feel it.  Bugs and gameplay I experienced zero bugs ! , and I can't say that for the first part. Obvious improvements are made. And finally that annoying elevator music, news, conversations and scenes are in the past! And no more exploring planets by that stupid unstable Mako thing. Combat is improved, much easier, you can use cover much easier, and squad power usage is simplified and very easy to use for fast combo kills. Decisions and storyline The importance of your decisions! I think that's what makes this game so good. I imported a ME1 character and loved how decisions I made affected almost everything I did in ME2. There is almost no right or wrong in this game. You should just play and make decisions the way you think you would if it was real life, and see how would that turn out. Also, ME1+ME2 decisions make a HUGE impact to storyline (main and DLC too) in Mass Effect 3. Unfortunately ME3 is not available on Steam.The story of this game is simply breathtaking. This time story doesn't develop that much around Shepard as it develops around his squadmates and crew members. ME2 is more personal, more sentimental than ME1. Relationship between Shepard and his squadmates is deeper and more complex. Also there are more romance options, and they are great!  DLCs Unfortunately by buying Digital Deluxe on Steam you don't get much DLCs. Also only way to purchase the DLCs that are not included in the DD are through Bioware Blog which is super annoying and super expensive. For example, DD cost me 5 euros, and just the  Shadow Broker DLC  costs 8 euros. If you plan on buying them,  Shadow Broker  is pretty much worth the money. Also  Arrival gives  you a new perspective of the story.  Kasumi's Stolen Memory  and  Zaeed's The Prince of Revenge  are okay, if you want a new squadmate with new combat abilities, but can't develop a relationship or romance. Other DLCs offer alternate appereances, weapons and armors but are not very necessary nor important for the story.  Summary You know it's a good game when the game makes you feel that you want it to be real and to be a part of it, no matter the cost. Well, this game made me feel that way. Only thing I don't like about this game is that it ends. This is, by far, one of the best gaming experiences I have ever had. I even dare to say that it actually is the best.P.S. I am not a very good writer, but I am very passionate when it comes to games so if you want a great story, decent shooting/killing, good graphics, want to feel like a hero and save the galaxy once again, then this is the game for you.

												What no one seems to mention is almost none of the DLC is included even after all this time. Not once, and I don't mean like it feels like it, I literally mean not a single damn time has the DLC ever gone on sale, it's still the same exact price it ever was and you have to go through Bioware.com to get it.You have no idea how much that pisses me off.It's one of my favorite games of all time too, it really makes me sad that after all this time Bioware can't just give us a complete version without needing to drop what is now more then the price of entry to get the full story that can be played. So freaking selfish.Remind me to never buy a EA game on sale without doing my homework ever again, let my failing be your lesson, my friends.Since someone was ""nice"" enough to ask for it, Here is my full review.                                                Mass Effect 2One of my favorite games of all time. I’ve played it from beginning to end, probably somewhere upwards of three to four times at least. I’ve owned it on both PC and PS3 before. In fact I still have some DLC from both versions through Bioware.comThere’s a lot to love here. It was an expansive sequel to Mass Effect that in your choices from the first game show up here, the gameplay was radically improved upon and the game just looks absolutely stunning!                                                        StoryFrom a storytelling point of view this game is absolutely gaming fodder. In the tradition of the best RPGs you go out looking for your merry (well some of them are merry at least) group of followers. It’s got almost a Seven Samurai vibe going on here. You have to hunt down an assassin whom is forever cursed with the ability to relieve any of his memories perfectly forever. A loyal space marine haunted by the fate of what ever happened to his father. The loyal (or is she?) right hand woman to the corporation that has brought you back from brink of death itself. Old friends and some interesting new ones are met as well.                                   It feels like a good bottle of port.                              Very smooth and relaxing to take it all in.Without spoiling anything major story wise, I’ll just say it added to it in all the right ways. Really made the game shine giving you so much more immersion you really end up wanting to play through to find out how your choices unfold and where these characters might end up.                                   Sets a great stage for the last game.                                                   Presentation                                            Well, it sure is pretty.The difference here is akin to comparing Witcher 1 to Witcher 3. It holds up remarkably well with age. It looks like it could come out today on the PC. My only gripe would be it could with a small update give us a wee bit more access to under the hood settings wise but that may be a tad unrealitic of me of Bioware. The game sizzles with amazing on screen effects, sound is really the main winner here though. Voice acting is the bar other games should set for itself. This game is pretty much one of the best voiced games I’ve ever heard to this day, easily in my top five. Witcher 3 and The Walking Dead season 1 edge it out just barely here in my book.                                                     GameplayOooo, it’s really fun this time around. It’s a cover shooter for sure, it has RPG underpinnings. Think small but powerful skill trees that equal up to either amazing combat abilties or skills to be used in game to help turn events or avoid combat all together, almost somewhere between Deus Ex and Call of Duty. It’s a lot of fun. It’s a squad based game so you almost always have a few allies in the thick of it with you which is really fun and makes combat managable but never impossible. I would say if you like action games, with light tactical consideration this a great contender for you.                                                    Lasting appeal.                                         Well it’s obviously a classic.I don’t particular enjoy the 3rd game which this one builds up towards well. So that's not what hesitates me to recommend this edition of Mass Effect 2. That would be like hating on Empire for Return.  That being said I’ve owned it multiple times which is something I don’t do often. It is a blast to play. But once again, my primary hesitation here is the lack of DLC missing from the current editions. The DLC is amazing content but after so many years it’s still just missing from the game they currently sell via steam and also on consoles. They don't label this at all. Which to me is deceiving. It’s their choice to charge full price after all these years for something that actually fills in plot holes story wise. I really want to recommend this game to you but it kills me a little bit inside how much I and many others have already given them money wise that they won’t just give people this content for free or at least at a huge price cut after almost seven years. I want you to have it I just don't want you to spend almost 30 dollars plus the cost of the base game to get it!   I refuse to pay more than I paid for the game itself for all this content. That and some of the content I bought in the past is missing from my Bioware account no less (not all of it but Lair of the Shadow Broker for example). I would go on but my first review is my honest reaction to buying this game only to find out after the return policy ran out that I have to rebuy content for a seven year old game not via steam but throguh an almost ancient website by todays standards and drop almost thirty dollars for story content (and that's not even all the content). Take what you will from this review and just know that I’m just trying to be honest with you about how this whole thing made me feel so that at the very least you might make a more informed decision then I did.

												The Mass Effect Trilogy is, hands down, the greatest video game series of all time right up until the last 15 minutes, and many consider Mass Effect 2 to be the best of the series.This is a crowning achievement of the RPG, sci-fi, and shooter genres that may never be matched.That being said, there are a few downsides to buying this on Steam vice Origin.First, Origin offers the entire trilogy for around $30, which is $5 less than you'll be able to get Mass Effect 1&2 for on Steam, and identical in price to the ME2 DDE offered through Steam.  Steam is unable to offer any such deal because Mass Effect 3 was hosted exclusively through Origin.Additionally, Origin has a much more convenient system for getting a hold of the DLC, especially if you purchase the trilogy as a set (which includes the two DLC packs for the original game, which have compatibility issues if installed any other way).  There are three large packs of story DLC for ME2 - Overlord, Lair of the Shadow Broker, and Arrival, which amount to around 10-15 hours of additional gameplay depending on your difficulty setting.  Additionally there's a bonus mission in which you [SPOILER ALERT] explore the crash site of the original Normandy. [SPOILERS END HERE]  There are two DLC companion characters, both of which appear in the third game if they survive, and several weapon, armor, and companion customization packs.  None of these are required, though at a minimum I recommend buying Lair of the Shadow Broker and Arrival due to the impact they have on setting up ME3.You should absolutely buy this game.  You just have to decide whether or not you want to go with Origin.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Did NONE of the shop keepers on the citadel get together afterwards, have some kind of 'pow wow' and say to themselves. ""Hey..he hustled EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US FOR DISCOUNTS...wth!"" Cause I know they heard each others advertisements standing around...smhSo imagine this, in whatever world mass effect exists. Imagine how often we hear advertisements in our reality. Just step back and picture that.Shep has..pretty much the monoply on advertising on the citadel..by sheer accident, so effectively alllll these people hear 24/7 is,""I'm commander sheppard and this is my blah blah blah.."" constantly...All day...Can you imagine that?

												This is truly one of my favorite games of all time, if not the very favorite. I've probably played through it 4 or 5 times on console and just had to do it again on PC. This game is absolutely incredible. You're seriously cheating yourself out of a great game if you pass this one by. The graphics are amazing, even for the continous progress of graphics in newer games. The soundtrack is unbeatable. Jack Wall did a terrific job on this game and everything you hear fits the atmosphere and intesity of whatever given situation you're in nearly perfectly. The story is inspiring and as deep as you care to make it. I don't want to reveal content, it's best to experience on your own and take it is as you go along. Aside from base story, every character has their own personalities, dialouges, and loyalty missions. You really grow connected to your crew and want to get to know them, and ultimately survive with them. I don't really think you find this degree of character connection anywhere else. Bioware really nailed it. If you haven't played the first game, I recommend it, but it isn't at all necessary. Story is filled in early on and you shouldn't feel confused or lost at all. On top of all this, Mass Effect 2 is completely replayable with different courses of action and character builds. My 22 hours were only a single completion run, and there is room for much more entertainment than that from this game.If nothing else, give this game a try. It's a masterpeice that shouldn't be ignored.			",130,11,0,6,9,3,12

												Will Steam or Bioware someday release a 'ME2 - Complete Edition'?? If not, don't buy it, the game is like 9,5/10, but if you start playing Mass Effect 3 (which is not available on Steam) without playing through ME2 DLC's (like i did x.x) which are only obtainable on bioware store via points purchase (lame²), you'll really lose a great bit of the plot there, and it will compromise your experience.PS: i don't know if it's only on steam version, but i got wallstucked like 5 times in the game, and had to restart from checkpoint, it's full of bugs!

												Truly, one of the best games ever made. A triumph in storytelling, and an unmissable part of your single-player videogames library.+Amazing characters; overall, one of the best narratives in Videogame history+Fantastic squad/class combat. Squad mates compliment each other to provide satisfying combat encounters. +Soundtrack is unbelievable. Top ten soundtracks of all time, imo.+Huge amount of longevity and repeatability.-Main Side missions, while they appear to be optional, will mean multiple characters die if not completed correctly. Feels slightly unfair and linear.-Mining feels forced and an arbitrary way to artificially extend the games length, not that it needed it.-It's so good, you feel sad when it's over.

												A title modern, innovative and fascinating, that's what Mass Effect 2, which continues the plots woven in the first chapter, shaking the roots to the canons of Western RPG and finding a balance between action and narrative that certainly leave its mark. Dialogues exciting and epic alternate with discussions of banal everyday life and camaraderie, giving rise to what has become a television series fiction serials, animated by characters full of nuances with which BioWare takes the luxury of tackling any kind of issue with a mature language and ironic. For some, perhaps, the turn from action adventure that took the crew of the Normandy will be a hard blow to be collected, but also for them we do not see sufficient reason why Mass Effect 2 is not a title to play completely.

												I can finally sprint outside of combat.---edit---I am greatly disappointed in one thing though, this version does not include some of the dlc. For example, the PS3 version included all of the dlc's such as the Lair of the Shadowbroker (which is hands down one fo the best dlc's ever), the extra character Kasumi, etc. This version only has Zaeed and a few weapons. When I found out it would likely cost me another $20 USD for the rest of the dlc, it left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth. I was hoping it would be the same version as the ps3 release, but it's not.If you have a ps3, you can get the fully-loaded copy of it for $11 on amazon. It's a must better deal than this, since all of the exra dlc's must be bought through Bioware/EA's website, and there are no sales on those dlc's from what I've seen.This game is one of my favorite RPG's ever. The game itself is absolutely fantastic, and with all the dlc's, there is a TON of content to enjoy. I'm giving it a negative review, because I thought it had all of the content for it, and it does not. There is nothing deluxe about it. Just a few free gimmicks, and a link to another site where you'll have to sink about another $20 to get the rest of the good content.So it's really a question of value. $11USD for all of the content for PS3, or $40-$50USD (when not on sale) for PC. How they can still charge this much, when I got the PS3 version years ago for $20CAD is beyond me.			",119,16,0,45,25,1,39

Short preview: (+) Enough good story. ✅  (+) Long game-time length. ✅  It was 68 hours for me, with all side-quests “assignments”, and DLCs  (+) Customizable dialogue. ✅  (+) Awesome end! If you’ve arranged the ‘No one left behind’ achievement. ✅  (+) Absolutely good voice acting by every single character! Yes, even the supporting characters too. ✅ (+) You can import your old ‘Mass Effect’ character with your old decisions what you made, and they impact to the ‘Mass Effect 2’ story line! ✅ → Steam-Guide here about it! ←   (-) Sometimes, Sheppard’s head pointed to the ground.  ✗  (-) Too complicated to get the DLCs from the Bioware website. ✗ There’s a → Steam-Guide how to do it here! ← (-) The Cerberus server bugged and you have to login almost every time. → Read about it here! ←[gaming.stackexchange.com]  (-) There’s not enough action, shooting. ✗ But, more than in ‘Mass Effect 1’ were.  Crashes / Bugs / Glitches:In 68 hours game-play, I had three rare game crashes. And Sheppard’s head sometimes pointed to the ground while moving forward. It was sadly strange, but it doesn’t prevent you to play.  My personal opinion:First of all, if you haven’t played and completed yet the first past of the ‘Mass Effect’, then I strongly-strongly-strongly suggest you buy it and complete it! You would miss many funny and serious links in between the Mass Effect one and two if you didn’t do it!  The game improved much since the first part, and, of course, came a few new issues, but non of them serious. → Here is my ‘Mass Effect 1’ preview ← if you interested in it. There aren’t repetitive side-quests, and it works well on ‘Windows 7’ and 10 64bit without hacking.  As it was in the first part of ‘Mass Effect’, at close to the end of the game, the story and the action dramatically blows up, and gives you an incredible interest! For me, the end cutscenes were better than a film! Of course, it depends on your decisions, if you want see the same as I did, then google it the ‘No one left behind’ achievement for more information.  Recommendation:I can recommend it to them who;   Liked and completed the first part of ‘Mass Effect’.  Like Sci-fi stories.  Like to talk with non human species.  Like to behave as you are. (Or at least similar what you are.)  Future atmosphere.  Achievement hunting:There’s no Steam achievements, but there’s in-game achievements. So, your Average-Steam-Achievement-Rate won’t increase or decrease with this game. It was a good news for me. ✅			",96,2,0,7,3,0,3

												If you're here reading this, I'm assuming you're one of two people.1) You heard about how amazing this game is and you're wondering if you should buy it. 2) You played the first ME and are wondering if this one is worth buying. For the first group of people, I have a very simple response. GO PLAY ME1! Trust me when I say you will be grateful that you did. First, it's an incredible game and it won't be a waste of your time. But most importantly, it will make this one feel so much more satisfying. Yes, it isn't ""necessary"" to play the first game. However, since this game follows the storyline of the exact same character from ME1, I believe it is more than worthwhile to experience the beginning adventures of Commander Shepard. The actions you take and the people you meet in the first game WILL import into this one. For that reason alone it is worth playing ME1 before ME2. If you are the second group, let me highlight some of the key differences between the two. This game focuses a lot less on aimless exploring and more on progressing the story. Some of the quests even have timers on them and force you to progress at certain points. Your party members are an integral part of your adventure and in my opinion, have a lot more to share with you and are able to build better relationships with Shepard. The Mako has been replaced with a planet scanner, yes this means there is a lot less world exploration, but there is still plenty of time consuming extra missions to partake in. You can have pets, whom I killed multiple times. Has anyone figured out the key to keeping your space goldfish alive? And, for my personal favorite...there is no inventory. None. Nada. But, I made my armor purple so that's pretty cool I guess. You win some you lose some. Overall this game is a big update on the first. To me, they felt like two very different games that meet at a central focal point. That central point is Shepard, who stays true to who they were in the first game. And isn't that what ME is all about?			",73,30,1,23,11,0,2

												This is not a game... It is an interactive movie of the most epic proportions. The characters alone are enough to make this one of the greatest achievements in storytelling I have ever had the pleasure to witness...In fact I'll go one further... Even if Shepards only companion in Mass Effect 2 was Garrus, it would still be awesome.And Legion... I rest my case...			",23,1,1,2,1,0,6

												ME2 is a good game. Vote is for EA/Origin & Steam.DLC content is not included in the install, only keys for it. Requires navigating the EA/Origin site to register the keys to DOWNLOAD the DLC to install it. Apparently did this a few years ago when I purchased it. Email address hasn't changed, account still existed, content attached to account did not.This is utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and as a result, I will *never buy* another EA game. Will also never buy a game which has a similar bait and switch method to retrieve content from another source.			",70,7,0,14,5,0,10

												Negative review regarding completely screwed DLC system not the game itself. As of this past month or so EA has magically made this game along with a crap load of the DLC free WHICH I PAID FOR VIA STEAM AND HAVE NEVER, EVER BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS BECAUSE ORIGIN IS SH!T. You get like three different CD keys for one single game because of course that makes sense. You are supposed to take these over to EA's site and register them via origin, except it doesnt work. The keys provided by steam do not work. Furthermore, getting a steam account linked to origin is an even greater pain and then ascertaining whether all the DLC is actually accesible to run via steam at that point is not something the average consumer should have to deal with. There is no excuse for this. The main story of this game is amazing. I just re installed origin and am currently getting  a free copy of the game along with all the DLC and more than I received here FOR MONEY ive never been able to enjoy because of this convoluted system. Attempting to buck steam and force people to use your lousy proprietary games client is not a good strategy. Releasing something you call a ""digital deluxe edition"" which does not include every last piece of DLC that has or will ever exist for the game and in fact includes less than 20 Percent of the available expansion content is ethically reprehensible. Is EA really not making enough money? Is ripping off the consumer really necessary just to make a profit? I have now paid for this game in two separate locations. Once on Xbox 360 and again on PC. I received a digital deluxe key for my PC copy on steam but have NEVER been able to access the content and you wont be able to either dont fall for this crap Steam ought to ban EA from selling any game on here again ever for this pathetic system. I am writing this review now because after multiple years EA has done jack all to make their DLC systems more consumer friendly and newer EA games suffer from the same convoluted issues. These measures do not prevent piracy but actually encourage it when paying customers are forced to look for pirated content to supplement the part of their game they were cheated out of. Despite Mass Effect 1 and 2 being my favorite modern science fiction fantasy I have refused to buy three and will likely not buy andromeda either because I refuse to give more money to people who seem so hell bent on stealing it. Dont buy this here. In fact dont buy it at all go download origin EA will give it away for free because their broken DLC model makes it more profitable for them to give you over half the game for free then attempt to nickel and dime you for things that shouldve been included on release rather than just selling a complete and well-polished game for a solid price.

												One of the best story games ever. Yeah, you read it right. I DO recommend this game, but NOT on steam because you won't be able to buy the dlcs(there are some important dlcs, believe me) or even continue the series since Steam has cut ties with EA. In my opinion, this game is the best if you play from ME 1 until the end (ME3).But... If you don't really mind not playing the sequel or buy any dlcs, then go ahead (although it wouldn't be worth it buying alone) Pros: 1. One of the first(if not THE FIRST) story-based game series where you get to make bonds with your extraterrestrial comrades and friends 2. Heavily story based3. A decision making gameCons: 1. Steam doesn't have the sequel game, the Origin does.P.S : I do know that the game does allow you to transfer the save files to the sequel, and that you can buy the dlcs at their own website. When I said you can't, I meant you can't buy the complete trilogy and all the dlcs in Steam. And have a complete set of your favorite game trilogy			",67,7,1,7,5,0,2

Pros:Graphics. This game came out 7 years ago, and it still looks good.Fantastic soundtrack.Writing is phenomenal - The overall story is well thought out, and masterfully paced.Crew characters have an amazing depth to them. Writing and voice acting is on point. Crew interaction and potential romances are well executed.Gameplay is solid. They hit an excellent balance between action and drama.Combat. It's a cover based squad shooter, with various character abilities. Character leveling, plenty of weapons and upgrades. It's a great mix of action, tactics, and RPG elements.Hard choices that actually matter.Cons:DLC - You have to visit bioware.com to download and install DLC, and I'm pretty sure the DLC is the same price it was at launch. 7 years ago.

 Best. Game. Ever. What is mass effect 2? Its the greatest choice's matter space action game out there. Mass Effect 2 brings a whole new style of play from Mass Effect 1. Mass Effect 2 is most likely the best Mass Effect game to start out on. Mass Effect 3 is the worst of them all, But its still okay. PROS. +You can make your own Shepard(character).+Choose your style of play, Stand back, Snipe em all. Or run in blazing guns shooting them in the head.+You can get a boyfriend or girlfriend, Depending on your gender.+Your team is your choice. Bring a doctor and a sniper, Bring a sniper and a scout, Bring a scout and a doctor.+The choices effect you and the world around you. Just like Life Is Strange and the tell tale game's.+Story is great.+Combat is the best combat.+Best voice acting and graphics for a 2012 game! CONS. -Not all DLC Is on steam.-Don't got a choice to what race you wanna be.-Some choices seem good, But thier really bad choices.-Can't custom your character's voice nor lips.(if you wanna make your character look like yourself or quiet from metal gear solid 5, you need lip custom ._.) OVERALL. 10/10, This game is the best outta the mass effect series and will hook you into the story and combat.			",71,7,0,9,7,0,0

												The Mass Effect series is one of the best (If not, then it is the best) series that I have ever played. With phenomenal music, gameplay and a magnificent storyline. If you have not played this game, I highly recommend it. If you have not played it and have no disire to play it, you're dead to me. Though the third installation of the Mass Effect series felt like it was lacking something, I enjoyed it. All in all, buy the games. It will be worth your money! :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My review on the first Mass Effect game racked up a bit of a following, so I though I might try a review on the second one. And while I'm at it, I will give out my opinion on the third one, too, as it isn't avaliable on Steam and I can't write a proper review on it anywhere else than here. Well, here it goes.Here's a bit of backstory; When I first heard about Mass Effect, it was just after the third game came out, and everyone was pretty irritated about the ending. I thought, ""Hey, this game looks pretty cool, despite what seems to be a pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ending."" And thats all I did. I thought. It wasn't till late 2016 that I got a beefy PC, and thought now was a good time to play all the games that I wished I could play earlier but couldn't get the chance to. I bought a few games here and there, but then thought about that game that had an amazing cult following and sexy alien lovemaking. So, I got on here and bought the first two games. All I want to do now, is to spread the love of this game to newcomers, to get people involved with the series. One of the biggest mistakes you could ever make in your career of casual game-playing. would be to skip this series, and not enjoy its marvelous story, characters, and atmosphere. The second one, for me, was amazing. The humor continued excellently, the characters grew in the best way possible, and the story branched out, making it an even better Space Opera. The edition of Squad loyalty missions was a huge improvement, making your journey with your characters sincere and meaningful. Characters from the first game made a comeback too, but some came back changed and different. And if you were sensible and played the first one first, and brought over your save so you could continue your journey to its fullest extent, then you have, quite possibly, the best Space-Action, Story-Driven, Romance-Fueled, Humor-Filled tale around.As for Mass Effect 3, its biggest flaw, for me, was not playing it on Steam. I had to go and download Origin, had to once again come up with a password that I will likely forget in a few months, and buy the game on a platform that I don't know how to  use. But it was all worth it. Mass Effect 3 is, in my opinion, really special. It was the end of the trilogy, and the Reapers (You will all be saying that word in Javik's accent soon enough, don't worry) have finally arrived, and Shepard's story comes to a close. Mass Effect 3's story was exciting, it had all the loveable crew back, and ended the series, in my opinion, perfectly. I won't spoil it for all of you that haven't played it yet, but the ending, depending on your actions, can be either bittersweet, or out-right terrible for everyone in the galaxy. But at the end of the day, the ending is tailored to you, and the choices you picked for Shepard. Due to the ending, the music, the conversations, the story, the romance, and DLC (Even though all the DLC costs more that the game itself, and unrightfully so), made this game my favorite in the series.Please, all of you that have not played Mass Effect, please go play it. It went from being a series that I had heard about, but never really took the time to play, to being my favorite series ever. And to all the people that have played them all, go back and play 'em again. It's worth it. Andromeda is around the corner, and it couldn't hurt to go back and refresh your memory. I'll hopefully see you all in Andromeda!Overall Rating: The whole series deserves a 10. Wouldn't want to miss this experience for anything.			",67,6,0,8,2,0,1

												The game itself is good but too many parts of the storyline comes in form of dlc, this would not be a problem or particulary strange if those dlc were available via steam but they are not.To get the real full pack you have to access to the clunky bioware shop, yes their own shop not even EA's Origin, where this dlc is stored. If this anoyance was not enough those dlc on biowares shop have not had a price drop since launch, neither have they had any sort of sale as steams does time to time, actually there isn't even a ""get all the dlc"" pack deal.I was looking forward to finish the trilogy but I don't want to play an incomplete game and neither I'm willing to pay for the ""additional content"" several times what I paid for the supposed core game. I feel cheated by this pricing policies and have decided to draw my line here. I'm sorry bioware but for me mass effect ended with the first installement.			",89,20,0,15,8,1,29

												Mass Effect 2 is one of the best RPG's I've played.It improves on almost every aspect of the first game which I thought could be better like combat, skills and powers and characters. Definitely one of the best games I've played. Pros:-Good story-Memorable characters with great voice acting-Much better combat and skill tree system than ME1(in my opinion).-Has many interesting and unique side quests many of which actually have a good story behind it.-Core decisions made in the ME1 carries over to the game and the decisions you make in the game impacts the game and also has a major impact in the next installment.-Great graphics for a 2011 game and never encountered any bugs.Cons:None			",510,180,17,97,80,13,91

												I bought this game (in a bundle with ME1) a year and a half ago, played the first one and didn't like it and deleted it. a week ago I was browsing my library and sawit and thought to myself ""what the hell, let me watch a video explaining what happened in ME1 and play ME2, it might be better"". best decision I have ever made.Pros:- Awesome characters and companions- companion can interact with you and each other- side quests are awesome- amazing OST- UNFORGETABLE STORY- the suicide mission- good dialogue system- good amount of guns and upgrades- good graphics and well-optimized- perfect voice actors- immersive atmosphere- Tali and Thane <3- hard choices :(- Cons:- have to go to bioware.com and download the DLCs there and install it, seriously?- speaking of DLCs, for a  6 year-old game they are still expesniveDespite the Cons, my final verdict is 10/10an aweseom game and and awesome experience I am worried about Mass effect 3 tho, they say the ending sucks :/			",197,25,0,7,10,0,21

												+ Compelling story that gives you the impression of being involved.+ Interesting characters that you'll either love or hate.+ Ability to load in player character from previous Mass Effect.+ Lots of refined features and mechanics over the original.+ Compelling atmosphere and convincing.+ Gorgeous and structurally sound main ships design.+ Engaging side quests.+ Decent non-essential characters.+ Mild humour in the right places.+ Variety of weapons/powers.+ Ability to define player character that is unique in ability/strength/weakness.o Cover shooting combat.o Influence on ending.o Informative loading screen animations.o Ability to seduce and start a relationship with certain crew members.o Mature content - No adult content.o Mining minigame. Opinions on enjoyment may vary.o Works with reasonably with Xpadder. Hacking/Bypass minigames require mouse/keyboard.- No native controller support.- Occasionally turns into a shooting gallery for filler.- Loading screens replace elevator rides/natural transitions.- No alternative ships available.- Navigation is menu heavy.- (Player) character feels glued to the floor/not a lot of physics involved.- (Male) player character can seem a bit robotic/unnatural in dialogue.- Confusing upgrade system/too different from original/not well enough explained.

												Mass Effect 2 was the first game in the Mass Effect Universe I ever played. Perhaps as a result of this, it is also my favorite in the entire series. Without spoiling anything for anyone who has yet to play the series, I won't talk about 1 or 3, neither will I discuss the plot, other than to say it is epic, amazing, and drew me in the way Millions were drawn in by Harry Potter. With that little disclaimer out of the way, Mass Effect 2 follows the story of Mass Effect 1, including whatever choices you made, as the consequences are felt while playing Mass Effect 2. If you did not import a save from 1, don't be afraid, you will get some of the backstory anyway. The playstyle, reminds me a lot of Knights of the Republic series in some ways, as you can slot weapons with upgrades, have various types of weapons to choose from, and so forth. Leveling up works in much the same way. Visually speaking, I think the graphics are excellent with Mass Effect 2, though I played it on the PS3 and not the PC yet, so I am unfamiliar with any graphical differences. As you progress through the story you acquire new members to your crew who can be chosen to form your team when landing on planets or going on missions. You are able to explore the galaxy using Mass Effect gates, and can go to individual planets within star systems, as well as moons, ship-wrecks and more. There are hundreds of side quests to do, as well as personal quest chains for each companion you acquire. Your ship, the Normandy can also be upgraded with the resources you acquire. These upgrades are not mandatory, but remember, every choice you make impacts the story in the end.In all, I would say Mass Effect 2 is a fantastic game and should be a part of anyone's library who loves First person, story driven, sandbox universe action. I highly, highly recommend playing the series in order from the first Mass Effect, so that you can have a story carried over through the end of the series based on the decisions you make. This will enhance your immersion in the game and is worth the cost of buying all three. I hope you enjoy this game as much as I have.			",479,176,24,74,66,6,86

												The Mass Effect Series is one of the most prolific, RPG stories ever written in my lifetime. there are very few games let alone a complete series that can attain this level of enduring replayability and quality of entertainment. The new ME series, Mass Effect: Andromeda will soon be at our doorstep and I for one am nervous with anticipation and excitement as Bioware expands its Mass Effect Horizons by building the series' future beyond the borders of our Galaxy, and reaching out to a new entire Galaxy seperate from our own. This is true genius and high intellectual imagination at its finest!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A worthy sequel of Mass Effect.This game has much more humour in it. Many new, great and diverse characters (and old ones too). I really liked their interesting and rich backstories.More side-quests. All environments are different and more varied compared to the first Mass Effect. There are no inventory or item drops. You just upgrade the core items (sniper, heavy pistol, heavy weapon, shotgun, assault rifle, submachine gun) with the modifications you find in missions or stores. [Enemies only drop ammo]The action is more fun and varied.The main story is not on the same ""wow"" level as the first Mass Effect tho. Just a few plot twists here and there. But still, it fills many gaps that were left after the first Mass Effect and expands on it.The only thing I didn't like in this game was a simple and annoying bug (It made me press F5 much more often, because I really didn't want to replay the same things if something went wrong). Your controllable character tends to get stuck above objects. You never know when this will happen. I just learned to avoid walking/running near the edges of objects... But still... very annoying. Especially during missions.And a tip:if you want to unlock the framerates and get rid of the harsh/pitch black/dark shadows, paste this in your GamerSettings.ini file. SmoothFramerate=FalseDepthOfField=FalseTEXTUREGROUP_Character_2048=(MinLODSize=64,MaxLODSize=2048,LODBias=0)TEXTUREGROUP_Environment_2048=(MinLODSize=32,MaxLODSize=2048,LODBias=0)MinShadowResolution=128MaxShadowResolution=1024You can find the file here: C:\Users\%username%\Documents\BioWare\Mass Effect 2\BIOGame\Config\GamerSettings.iniEDIT:Just finished Mass Effect 3. What an awesome last game of this trilogy. Really recommend to get it on Origin. You will not be disappointed at all.The very first minutes will make you say: ""oh crap, the sh|t just got real!"".The animations and gameplay are much more fluid and responsive than in Mass Effect 2. The sound effects and the massiveness of the enemies/surroundings leaves you in awe.The graphics improved too. Weather effects (storms, rain, dust, etc.) are gorgeous. I think this game has the best dialogues between the characters in the series. There are so many good and funny remarks/situations.Didn't experience any game breaking bugs or crashes. Just some tiny glitches, but nothing bad really.I don't know why the ending was so criticized by the media and players.., I really liked it (just don't shoot anything at the very end, just a tip ^^). What an awesome trilogy. One of the best games you can experience to this date.p.s. make sure to edit the same file in ME3 too, if you want to unlock fps and get rid of the dark shadows.

												This one is the best in the series. If you asked Mass Effect fans which one is the best, they will say the 2nd one, hands down.Its just better overall. The combat is smoother and more fluid, and easier to get used to. The voice acting is wonderful, and the characters memorable. And the best thing is that you can see all the people you fought with in the 3rd and final game (if you keep your character throughout the whole series).Its one of my favourite games ever, in my top 5.

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.Mass Effect 2 is a great, nearly perfect sequel to its predecessor Mass Effect. The graphics got better, the gameplay got better, and so did its story. We have ourselves a larger cast of characters, some broader choices, and some nicer areas and gameplay sequences. This game is a must play for almost anyone, satisfiesIt would actually be strongly recommended to play the first game before this one, or else the game may come off with the wrong effect, and it won't be as enjoyable.The game will satisfy you more than any other game and if some thought that the first game is pure greatness, then go try ME2 and double your motivations. just play, enjoy and see how games should really be made.

												Mass Effect trilogy stands as the best trilogy and sci-fi games I have ever played. Mass Effect 2 is the best of the three for me. I can't explain just how much I honestly love this game. I originally played this on xbox360 and later PS3, so obviously I had to play it on PC also. I've lost count how many times I have finished ME2 ^_^.It has amazing story, fantastic voice acting, emotional characters that feel real and you will care about, lots of conversations where you make the choises, space exploration, different species, the gameplay is just really amazing and of course there's one hell of a epic OST that will give you so much feels omg.Building your team and meeting new people is done very well. It has everything that makes a perfect experience imo. The story of ME2 starts with a jawdropping moment and ends in one of the most epic ways possible, that will surely blow your mind everytime...Mass Effect 2 maybe belongs in my top 5 games ever.I absolutely recommend this whole trilogy for anyone who like Sci-fi,  RPG genre and unforgettable characters+story !Few bad sides are that there's no full DLC or achievements on Steam version, Origin's release has the achievements I think. Digital Deluxe Edition don't contain all DLC, but the rest of DLC can be bought from Biowares website using points. Also ME3 is digitally available only on Origin for PC, which is a shame that they couldn't release it here too.			",201,45,2,38,6,0,8

												This game was the most amazing RPG I have ever played! 31 hours full of emotional story, action and exploration. This Game is by far one of the best games here on Steam and everybody should play it!This Game has features of the Tell Tale Games but with actuall consequences. Unlike the tell tale games, choices here do matter. Which gives this game a huge replayability. You can also choose to be either way male or female and the outcome with all the characters will be different. So go back and play it again to see what you can make different this time!The Gameplay itself is very good and responsive. Altough sometimes I got a bug where I got stuck and couldn't go anywhere else. What this bug looks like you can see here ->  Mass Effect 2 Bug  But this hardly happened only 3 times I believe. To fix it simply reload your latest save or restart the mission.The Voice acting was rather impressive and the music as well. I also enjoyed very much that I could devcide what outfit my character is wearing and which color it should have. The Ship and Guns/Armor are upgradeable which makes it alot of fun to farm for rescources.I am personally not a very big fan of space game and doubt that I would off liked that game, but after giving it a chance I just fell in love with it and couldn't stop playing, Everything on it is wonderful and I could not find anything negative at all on it. I can recommend this game to anybody for its full price.			",329,157,4,49,23,2,28

												Mass Effect 2, aka ""The empire strikes back"" of the  Mass Effect series, is the only SP game I've gone back to play and complete 7 times. It was so good that after pirating to try it out,(t was a long time ago get off my back)it caused me to buy it, then the first game, and lastly the third once it came out. Eventually buying the whole triolgy, twice(console and PC).It is also the first game to actually make me think through and understand the consequences of my decisions. A failure to do this resulted in clear liquid leaking from my eyes for an undisclosed amount of time.			",162,33,4,15,10,3,12

Instead the Shepherd forgets about the misunderstood invading aquatic robotics and goes and hangs out with Wrex, that's what this game really should have been about actually. Also the hot blue alien is in it except she isn't really unless you buy reasonably priced EA quality downloadable content which is actually the best part of the game that should have been in it.My favourite game: -34/10 Needs more Wrex - Kotaku IGN.com.org ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is my opinion of Mass Effect 2   Aspect Rating   story 9.0   Graphics 8.5   Sound 10   Gameplay 9.0   Overall 9.1 Scores are out of 10. Overall score is an average. Mass Effect 2 is the perfect sequel to the Mass Effect series. With its amazing visuals, voice acting, soundtrack, and direction, Mass Effect 2 comes to life. Mass Effect 2 manages to fulfill its incredible ambition while only suffering from very few technical hiccups. I do recommend playing Mass Effect 1 first as the decisions you make in the first one will have an effect on the second Mass Effect. But if you miss out on the first one, that isn't any reason to skip this fantastic videogame.			",80,29,0,14,10,0,0

												Mass Effect 2 is the second part of one of the best game series that exists and I've played it twice to see which actions affects which part of the game and I would play it again. After playing ME1 it wasn't an big question for me to play the ME2. The story, the characters and atmosphere were too good in ME1. Mass Effect 2 unfolds the mysths about the Reaper and what happend to the Preatorians.I don't want to spoiler anyone so that's all I am saying about the story.Some parts were better in the first game, for example: The CitadelThey decreased it's areas you are able to explore from game to game. In ME1 you are able to go anywhere.But the developers changed the focus from a explorational to a more action-rich gameplay.The battle controls haven't changed at all. You can give orders to your squad-mates to attack someone, taking cover or using their special abilitys. I do recommend to talk to your whole team for an loyalaty bonus!But be careful sometimes you have to choose one side in an discussion which affects the manner of someone to you. Just like in real life.Overall Mass Effect 2 is an great game with beautiful graphics, an interesing story and characters.Totally recommended!Oh and you better play Mass Effect 3 Extended Cut too. Just to get the whole story.			",185,24,11,15,4,0,9

												Pretty much the best of the trilogy, character work is excellent and it ties into the ""decade feel"" of the Mass Effect Trilogy (ME1 - Optimistic 70s Sci-Fi; ME2 - Dark 80s conspiracy sci-fi; ME3 - Overblow, bombastic 90s invasion sci-fi). Great game, fun play, good combat system, and interesting character design. Definitely worth a pick up if you haven't played yet (better if you buy the original and play through the entire trilogy with imports).			",145,44,1,37,14,2,38

												While I've my fair share of criticisms of the series as a whole and both the 1st and 3rd entries, I count Mass Effect 2 among the best games I've ever played and believe it not hindered at all by the imperfections of its predecessor nor its sequel.Oh hey, I'm going to spoil some stuff by the way so careful reading. You've been warned.It is, with some caveats, a masterpiece in writing, cinematic presentation, character design, middle-entries-in-trilogies, world-building and tight, focused gameplay.For the most part, it's also pretty and varied in its art style and variety of environments, the only rough bits to look at are the splotchy textures on a few things that look like they're from ME1.The soundtrack is incredible and memorable, and I count it as being among the best game soundtracks. Perfectly matches mood and builds suspense.Fair to note at the outset I've got 130 hours logged on this copy and an additional 130 on another copy, so a little over 250 total.Shooting and cover are responsive and enjoyable. While ME2 lacks the cover-rolling and melee maneuvers of ME3, I'd argue that the health systems, enemy types and level designs make for much better shooting and gameplay in the 2nd title than the 3rd.ME3 segments enemy health into blocks or chunks, ME2 displays it all as one bar continually draining, the same applying for your health and shields. Very clear how much progress you're making towards killing a target.More importantly though, most of ME2's engagements can be handled with methodical patience and careful use of cover and squadmates -- it makes even the hardest difficulty a joy to play on all but some of the collector missions.ME3, on the other hand, is filled with missions involving reaper-type enemies that run at you and force you out of cover and involves more luck than it does method or thought. It was only after running through ME3 a couple times I realized just how well-designed ME2's experience is.You'll get more frustration-inducing kind of difficulty out of ME3's experience than you will the kind of careful, well-designed and enjoyable difficulty you'll get out of ME2.Of course, one can also look backwards and respond to the opposite complaint about this game's sheer divorce from ME1's RPG mechanics. If you want to argue ME2 has departed from ME1, you'll hear no argument from me.Given what an awkward, bumbly experience ME1 was though, I don't think it hurts ME2 at all being a responsive, well-designed third-person shooter with RPG elements. I'd rather it was that than ME1 -- a third-person shooter that isn't sure if it wants to be a shooter or an RPG and just ends up doing the shooting, cover and RPG elements wrong.(Hey, I can see those fanboy tears welling up in your eyes! Before you start writing some inane comment telling me just how wrong I am, I recommended ME1 too.)I mentioned caveats, let's cover those. For those who did the majority of the side quests in the first game, you know that Cerberus is an evil human-supremacist group willing to do horrible things to achieve their ends.In a fantastic writing twist, that same group decides to recover Shepard's body after he dies and reconstruct him, bring him back to life, make him into an effective tool both for humanity's interests but also their organization's.In a not so fantastic writing twist, Shepard seems pretty chill about this. The player is given some opportunity early on to object but for the most part Shepard seems pretty okay with cooperating.Given Shepard's history with and knowledge of the group coupled with his loyalty to the Alliance and affinity for not being a terrorist, you might think Shepard might look for more ways out or the game might present the player with such an option. At a minimum, it seems strange that we are basically funnelled into this path with little recourse in an RPG.There are compelling reasons why Shepard might cooperate. They might feel, rightly, that they owe a debt to them for resurrecting him and they might also be tempted by that shiny new Normandy and the support of former allies Cerberus recruits. They also might agree, as the Illusive Man argues, that Cerberus is the only organization that recognizes the reaper threat at the moment, and will help him/her investigate and stop them.That's all fine and dandy, but the player is mostly left to decide whether they accept these reasons in their head, There's not a lot in conversation and dialogue involving Shepard that makes it clear Shepard understands or accepts any of the implicit or explicit reasons for accepting their present situation.However, that all being said, ultimately the choice the writers made to take the narrative in this direction pays off. We're presented with a complacent and careless galactic government that won't acknowledge countless colonies dropping off the map.Cerberus recognizes it though, and has given you the resources and people to investigate. They suspect it's the 'Collectors'. A mysterous race that most have never seen that dwells beyond the equally mysterious Omega 4 relay. Of course, no one has ever returned after going through this particular relay.Once this is all confirmed, the game sets you into a broader framework of building a team, one that is in it to go through the relay and stop the Collectors.The team you build must be perfect, include the best, most committed and skilled operators the galaxy has to offer.The Council has pretty much disavowed you at this point, and, even if you're nice to them, don't really want to see you poking your nose where it doesn't belong in Council space.All of this sets things up perfectly for the game's setting: an adventure through the dark, criminal underworld of the galaxy. It gives the writers opportunity to flesh out new characters, species and places. Stark tonal shift from the first game. It gives them, basically, an opportunity to hugely expand the depth and breadth of Mass Effect's world. And this they definitely do.Missions span hubs like Omega, Illium and the Citadel to war-torn Tuchanka to mercenary-infested Korlus to distant, hazardous Haestrom. Many more. You're introduced to a lot of corruption and dirty, self-interested politics and characters. Mercenary groups. Extortion. Racism. Murder. Not that you participate in these things, but you see them happening.This dirtier, darker galaxy immerses the player quite well and really sucks you into the subplots of the places and people it affects. You'll care about the people and places of this world.Many more varied places and situations to discuss, not enough space here to write about them.In the context of these dark, horrible places, you're introduced to characters new and old and even the old ones are given new stories, as time has passed since you last saw them. You see characters evolve, change attitude and outlook. Great writing.Past the old characters, the new ones are compelling and interesting. Everyone loves Mordin. Okay, not Jacob. He sucks.Each potential team member is given their own mission with a completely unique level design, objectives and context surrounding their recruitment. Missions are varied and replayable.The team that you build though, after all this world-building and character development has occurred over the better part of the game, is meant to undertake a suicide mission in going through the relay.To say BioWare excellently builds up to this climax wouldn't do it justice. Your choices and the amount of time and effort you invest into the team you build play a decisive role in the outcome of the mission and you get a strong sense about how everything has built up to this point.There are few moments in gaming that I can think of that compare to ME2's suicide mission.There's so much more to say about this game and how amazing it is, but Steam recommendations have character limits.

												The original Mass Effect isn't very fun. The lore and universe it sets up are amazing, but your inventory fills up so fast that micromanaging it becomes necessary at annoying times, sometimes it feels like you pick up more junk items here than in Diablo, the romance options were pretty lame, the combat was just lame, vehicular segments were the worst (climbing up tall hills/mountains at -just- the right angle to try to get over them, copy/pasted buildings on various planets with very slight differences to their arrangement of furniture and such, side quest overload at the Citadel with almost no side quests anywhere else in the galaxy, and...yeah, it just wasn't very good. I'm glad it happened, though, because it meant Mass Effect 2 happened, and boy did I have a good time with it. Oh, and the ending song on Mass Effect 1 is totally great in my book. <3Mass Effect 2 doesn't do much for the lore, in all honesty. You get a little more info on mercenary groups and an organization called Cerberus, and that's about it. Mass Effect 2 is all about gameplay, and it fixes everything I complained about above. Those things are either gone or made better so that you have a good time. Far more romance options with more interesting characters, all fresh maps, the vehicular stuff in DLC is easy to maneuver around in, side quests are all over the place instead of conglomerating 75% or so of them into one map you pick them up at, the combat lets you use special abilities more often while still balancing it out and making it so much more fun with shields, barriers, and armor on the enemies, and instead of mountains of useless items, you pick up a gun, and it's added to your loadout you can choose from on a mission. That's it. No tiny incremental stat gear like in Mass Effect 1 where you waste your time dealing with paltry differences in gear.Mass Effect 2 is head and shoulders above Mass Effect 1, and it is the best game in the trilogy for me. Mass Effect 3's ending was a travesty, and though it had some solid gameplay, I still enjoy 2's better somehow.			",428,108,2,62,33,5,50

Pros:- Story (Extremely compelling, it's up there with stories like The Last of Us and BioShock Infinite)- Good Graphics- Great Combat System- Extremely Challenging (on Insane difficulty anyway)- Characters (10/10. Miranda <3)- Character Development- Mass Effect. Nuff said. - Tons of side missions to do, including tons to get the best ending possible- Explore the Universe! (Limited, but still great)- Massive Replayability (Multiple Endings affected by the whole game, so you can replay it lots of times)- Just a Great gameCons:- You can't erase your memory and experience this fine work of art over and over again. :(			",224,20,0,25,5,2,22

												This game is such a huge improvement over the first game in which especially the vehicle parts were very dull. In this game you play as Commander Shepherd again after being brought back to life after the incidents in the last game, you can also choose to have all the choices you made in M.E.1 be carried over to this game as you start.The most amazing thing about this game is the story, it is very immersing and rich, and I kept just wanting to find out more about what was going on, the same can be said for Mass Effect 1, which was also amazing story-wise. Other than that the combat is quite mediocre, its okay I mean, but not the best ever. Movements etc are kind of clunky. But as I said you will play this game for the story, and you will love it for the story.Pros:+Amazing story+Semi-Open world+Choices which really change things+Multiple Endings+Well written dialogue and very well voiced.Cons:-With a 2016 viewpoint the combat system leaves a lot to be desired-Squad members are kind of useless-Combat just becomes a means of reaching the next bit of story or lore.-Again, combat is repetitive.-Movement is clunkySo I give it; 8/10			",61,6,0,9,14,0,9

												For me Mass Effect 2 (as well as Mass Effect 1) is worth playing because of the characters. Getting to know everyone and then learn everyone's background is such a great idea. Most players can find a connection with each character. You really care for them and it's devastating if any one them dies. The story itself wasn't really good, but it's these characters that made the story work. Mass Effect 2 is set in a richly detailed world on the brink of destruction. It's a must-own for science fiction fans!

												Mass Effect 2 lives up to its hype and ratings it has received.  It alters the gameplay and item system enough from its predecessor that it almost feels like an entirely different game.  As you continue the journey of Commander Shepard, you can only be drawn closer to the commander and each of his allies you learn to love - and hate.  Verdict: Mass Effect 2 improves upon its predecessor in almost every aspect and simply adds to the addiction and the wonder that is Mass Effect.  Bottom line, this is a series you will NOT want to miss.			",166,34,3,11,13,1,36

												Oh, Miranda. Oh, dear Miranda...Mass Effect 2. You've had to have heard those words at least once in your gaming life. Whether if it was a Youtube video, or maybe just chatting with a friend. You had to have heard of this legendary title. Well, I'm here to say that Mass Effect 2 is EASILY one of the finest games of last generation.I'll start with the visuals. I have to admit, the visuals in this game are still very impressive, even after nearly four years. If you are a friend of mine, you would probably notice that I frequently take screenshots of in-game stuff, usually something about it's beauty. Now, I've played numerous games that are really stunning, but I haven't taken this many screenshots for a game since Skyrim. I'm HIGHLY impressed with this game's graphics.The gameplay is a very strong point in the game. Mass Effect 1 was more tactical and people didn't like that, along with squadmate abilities, some in-game choices, and more. However, Mass Effect 2's gameplay was much smoother, even if lots of ME1 RPG elements were taken out. The gunfights were heated and awesome. Choosing squadmates and using the abilities they have make the game have a slightly more strategic approach. However, when you could actually have an option to do something else. In one mission, one of my squadmates said that we could sneak past the enemies, but when I attempted to do so, there was no way of actually sneaking past them without triggering the alarm, thus making some missions pretty linear.The story is a step down from the first Mass Effect and even the third Mass Effect. It goes completely off topic. But, there's a reason why I'm praising the game in the ""story"" section. It's simple. The lore in this game is INCREDIBLE. When you search planets for resources to survive missions, you need to scan the planet and send probes to retrieve your materials. Before you do scan though, there is a decent sized blurb that describes life on the planet and lots of facts about the planet. There's lots more, too. However, you'd just have to buy the game so you can be amazed by that. Also, the CHARACTERS. The best part about this game is the CHARACTERS. Tali is a little clumsy, especially around me. Grunt has an aggresive attitude and lusts for bloodshed. Mordin is crazy, and seems like he cares little for death, and talks in an extremely fast pace. Should I describe anyone else? I didn't think so. Although the plot was rather off-topic and poorly done, I praise this part of the game highly for lore and characters.The audio is just alright. It seems like A. The same music is played over and over again or B. All the songs sound the same. This is probably the weak point to this unforgettable RPG. Even friends of mine agree, the music in this game is just meh. However, I do think the voice actors did a strong, strong performance for their roles. The replayability is actually pretty good. Beat the game? Play as a Renegade, or maybe play as a heroic Paragon. Play as the opposite gender. Side with someone else. ""Do it"" with another romance option. There's lots to do, and there's even some DLC you can download. You have quite a bit to do. The key problems to this game include the following: Lots of glitches, the space bar seems to be overused, making cover/run/interact/etc a bit clunky. The game is somewhat linear. That's about it!In the end, Mass Effect 2 is one of the best RPGs of last gen, but also one of the best GAMES of last gen. It's amazing, and I highly, highly, highly recommend it. Go ""do it"" with Miranda, would you?Graphics- 9/10Gameplay- 8.5/10Story- 10/10Audio- 7/10Replayability- 8/10**GANDHI GAMING PERSONAL PICK**.:9.4/10:.+Amazing characters+AWESOME final mission+Lots of lore+Good gameplay+Stunning graphics+High replayability-Relies heavily on space bar, makes controls a bit clunky-Numerous glitches-Somewhat linear			",150,23,0,20,8,2,12

""They tell me it's a suicide mission. I intend to prove them wrong.""Chances are that when asked about games you consider to be classics or personal favourites, you have a handful that you fondly remember and can still pick up and play even today. As such, Mass Effect 2 is, by no means, a perfect game nor the ""greatest"" game. It suffers from issues that have polarised many in the community, from the supposedly awkward combat to the infamous elevator rides. Yet even after nearly 5 years and dozens of playthroughs, (across multiple platforms), it still remains a personal favourite.Though released under the thumb of everyone's favourite publisher, the period around the release of Mass Effect 2 also saw the equally excellent Dragon Age: Origins appear, marking the triumphant return of BioWare and Western RPGs in a whole new way. You are once again placed in the boots of Commander Shepard and are weeding out the remnants of indoctrinated Geth when a new threat, known as the Collectors, reveal themselves, turning the tables on you and your crew in an incredible opening sequence. Abandoned by The Council and now working under the orders of the pro-human extremist group Cerberus, you must once again build yourself up from nothing, gather your crew, prepare yourself and travel through the Omega-4 relay to end The Collectors once and for all.""We're all asking you to do the impossible, Shepard. No pressure.""A heavily stylised and cinematic experience, BioWare's so-called space opera features some of the best writing around, easily quotable and frequently amusing. Regardless of your opinion of BioWare and the controversies in recent years, it is difficult to deny the depth of characterisation and investment that the studio has brought to the Mass Effect series. From the opening titles all the way to the end credits, Mass Effect 2 has a quality that others still aspire to and fail to achieve. You will grow attached to your crew but in different ways compared to other playthroughs, especially with the romance and loyalty mechanics. The game allows for what can only be described as true role-playing, in a more accessible medium than that of pen-and-paper.From the character customisation to the dialogue wheel to the open-ended Paragon/Renegade morality system, you are free to shape your Shepard however you wish and determine the fates of not only your crew but the galaxy itself. With the addition of the import save file feature, playing through the series carries further weight as for every choice there certainly is a consequence; many of which are severe and often unexpected, especially in the final mission where everything and everyone is on the line. Successfully pulling off the aforementioned Suicide Mission without a single death is truly epic and will stay with you long after the credits roll and Jack Wall's excellent soundtrack finishes. As it is action-oriented, the squad-based gameplay features an impressive range of enemy types and classes, six of which are available to Shepard and complement specific weapon loadouts and cross-class abilities with your team of four per mission. Although the game goes to great lengths to encourage experimentation with a good range of weapons, you'll most likely have a loadout well and truly established for each character within a few hours, with exception to the researched upgrades later in the game. Finite magazines have replaced the overheating component of previous weapons, which significantly affects the style of combat between the two. You'll be taking cover and pausing more often, relying more on biotics than the first especially to get through the various layers of protection. The tactical UI has been cleaned up a bit and there are other significant changes from the first game. For one, there isn't an inventory or loot system. At all. The top-of-the-line weapons are simply found, bought or researched. Weapons are assigned prior to missions and medi-gel is frequently littered throughout levels, now used only to revive teammates. Shepard's N7 is the centrepiece in terms of armour, featuring modular customisation, but other parts and sets can be found or bought. Over all, combat is certainly more streamlined then the chaotic firefights of the first game, but feels more realistic and enjoyable. Shepard no longer feels like a demi-god, instead like the lone soldier fighting tooth-and-nail against all odds that they're meant to be.""The Collectors are about to find out what happens when you♥♥♥♥♥♥me off.""The galaxy map and vast array of missions will take you from the heights of glorious Illium to unsettling space stations to the seedy underbelly of Afterlife and Omega. In terms of graphics, Mass Effect 2 isn't the best looking game for its time, choosing more of a gritty, contrasted artstyle that BioWare's heavily modified version of Unreal Engine 3 allows for but still looks great all the same.. even when wandering around the Normandy for the umpteenth time. AI is surprisingly quite good, significantly better than a lot of other games, with only the rare kamikaze or doorway block. There were occasional minor framerate drops and in terms of bugs, I encountered some clipping and camera issues but nothing significant or game-breaking. A quick reload usually fixes most of the few that remain. Having played this for hundreds of hours on the PlayStation 3, the experience has been pretty good on both platforms. The only major criticism here is due to the Steam version, rather than the game itself, and the lack of DLC. Already having owned all the available DLC on console, the Digital Deluxe edition contains the ""Cerberus Network"" DRM, (which, at the time of writing, apparently has been shut down), with the only meaningful addition being Zaeed Massani as an additional companion. The best content, like the Lair of the Shadow Broker, Kasumi and The Arrival, costs more than twice the initial price of the Steam edition, let alone when it's on sale. Besides the fact that this is overseen by Electronic Arts, the fact that DLC costs more for a game that is over half a decade old is unacceptable.""Just once I'd like to ask someone for help and hear them say, ""Sure. Let's go. Right now. No strings attached.""Do I recommend Mass Effect 2 for everyone? No. In fact, I know many people who hate it with a passion, and that's fine. It certainly isn't for everyone. But this is a Steam review, so let's continue in the not-so-objective manner. It is a captivating ride from start to finish with thousands upon thousands of lines expertly delivered by the cast, bringing Shepard's crew and the complexities of the alien worlds and relations to life. The triumph of Mass Effect 2 is that it captures not only the sci-fi epic but the humanity that underpins it. The love and effort that BioWare have put into crafting this is second-to-none as the game constantly drives you into exploring and, above all, determining how you play. For a genre that is so overused, parodied and often mishandled, Mass Effect 2 is a truly epic example of a game done right and the pinnacle of the BioWare RPG. How much enjoyment and investment you get from this ultimately comes down to personal preference, though coming from someone who knew nothing about the series going into their first playthrough, I'd ask that you give it a chance. Even just on sale, it's worth it.Though I'd recommend that you experience the trilogy from start to finish, this also stands proudly amongst the best in its own right. This and Dragon Age: Origins may be a far cry from the days of Baldur's Gate or KOTOR but still remain a personal favourite. Just like old times. Cheers for getting this far, reader, as this review is certainly long enough. I should go.			",132,20,0,20,4,1,3

												So I picked up this game a while ago and it kinda sat in my library for a while because I bought ME 1 around the same time, so I play all the way through ME 1 and get to know all of the characters. Fast forward to me starting a new game, I thought all was going to be great until I died. Then after being resurrected I realized that all of the characters I have grown to know and love had all moved on away from me and that I was essentially on my own against a dangerous enemy with only a bunch of rascist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s around me. Then I recruit back two of my former squad and was so happy that I had some familiar faces around. Later on I learned that one of the former squad was in love with me since ME 1 and that I had been ignoring them the entire time. Then more towards the end something catastrophic happened and a lot of people that I had now grown closer to died. The ending was extremely satisfying and very emotional based on who died.10/10 would cry from a fictional character death again.			",35,3,0,3,7,0,24

												Pretty damn good. I'll just ditto and list positives and negatives. +Great story with good characters and different choises. The last mission was actually really thriling.+Way better animations, slighty better graphics.-The controls took some time to get used to.You cant crouch and instead of using E to use, space runs, uses and goes to cover. Q and E move your squadmates. A bit annoying but I got used to it after 5 hours.- Less side missions, therefore shorter.9/10Really rememberable and replayable. I liked it.(Side note: I very likely won't play ME3 because Origin and really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ending with some weird cyber-kid and dumb♥♥♥♥♥♥ Also, no matter the ending you pick, you die. Eff dat.)(Side note 2: I want to play ME3 because of this game's ending. Reasons above should make me not want to. But still.)			",134,8,3,11,6,1,7

												I'm a huge fan of the trilogy thanks to this game.I have five gameplays and cannot get tired of it.Mass Effect 2 is the best of the trilogy, the story is involving and exhilarating, the new characters, worlds and quests, along with better graphics and gameplay are a huge upgrade comparing to the previous game.This is also the most solid of the three, on all aspects, specially the script. Though the morality options seem a little silly sometimes, they're okay.I recommend this to everyone that enjoys a good rpg and sci-fi game(probably the best)			",167,15,3,24,4,0,4

												The whole game convinces emotionally and brings to continue to play. One lives, and feels like in a breathtaking movie. If not, you even feel yourself in the middle of Space. Mass Effect 2 is for me the best part, since I find that this offers the most leisure time and play time. One can land on many Planets with its space ship, and this exploration. You can personalize and customize your Character according to your own wishes. Regardless of appearance, or Armor. Mass Effect is a madness game!I split my opinion into the following categories:-GraphicThe graphics are excellent for an already older game, and it does not consume too much hardware performance. However, Mass Effect looks very good, not more.-SoundThe sound is a part of many that makes the game so class! The sound effects sound realistic. It is not a simple shooting of a laser beam that delivers a gun. There is something more behind it. Everything feels very real. The music and the soundtracks in the game are bombastic. They make the entire game more emotional and genuine. It's like in a movie.-ControlMass Effect 1 Players have to adapt very much, since the control has been completely revised. For example, it is no longer possible to jump to Shift. This is done by pressing the empty button while running. The control is however not bad, or spongy.-AtmosphereThe last and most important category in my report is probably the atmosphere of the game. The whole galaxy is open to you! It is a beautiful image, if you are not on a mission, for example, and simply looking out of the window in your space ship.			",59,16,0,8,4,0,2

												Just go buy this game. It's the best thing created by a human ever. Except for Breaking Bad. Both are amazing...not convinced? Damn. Well, let's review Mass Effect 2 then.A hundred and fifty years in the future, humanity has figured out FTL travel and has found their place in the galaxy among the numerous alien races. A rogue Spectre nearly brings on the end times by summoning giant robots that wipe out all life called the Reapers, barely being stopped by another Spectre (yes, that is you and yes, this took place in the last game), proving humanity's worth. You play as Commander Shepard... until he or she gets spaced. This isn't really spoiling since it happens in the first five minutes. But a group called Cerberus decides to bring Commander Shepard back to life to fight the Collectors, a mysterious race of aliens who have been abducting human colonies. Shepard agrees to work for it, though he or she is a bit hesitant since Cerberus is barely a step above a terrorist organization. The story then follows you recruiting numerous people with various talents for a Suicide Mission against the Collectors, where your decisions there and your team decides whether everyone lives or everyone dies. Good luck, Commander.Gameplay is fantastic. The combat is a lot better than ME1, instead of the overheat system, you get the traditional gun system, and I like this more than the overheat system. There's also now a reason to use powers, even if you have awesome guns, you'll still need to use them on some enemies, compared to ME1 where once you got some good guns, it didn't really matter if you used powers or not. Squadmates are also a lot more useful, the 6 in ME1 (5 in the end... sometimes 4... spoilers?) gets boosted up to 10 (12 if you have the DLC), all of which are very good and have distinct personalities. Plus you can bang some of them, so that's nice.  All hail dat Quarian booty! There is also a good upgrade system, although in order to get the materials to do so, you have to do a kinda boring scanning minigame, which is not that fun to do. There are six classes (Soldier, Adept, Engineer, Sentinel, Vanguard, and Infiltrator), all of which are a lot more distinct than in ME1. I for one prefer Vanguard, but all classes are overall decent from what I hear. There are multiple conversation branches, a Paragon/Renegade morality system that is affected by dialogue and interrupts that you take, and loyalty systems, which once you do a mission for a character, they become loyal, making them more likely to survive the Suicide Mission and gets that squadmate a new loyalty power. Gameplay is fun, that's all that matters.Characters are likeable for the most part. Shepard is customizable, letting you choose his/her looks, gender, and backstory. The squadmates you'll get, Miranda, Jacob, Garrus (returning from ME1), Jack, Grunt, Mordin, Tali (also returning from ME1), Thane, Samara, Legion, Zaeed (if you get the Cerberus Network DLC) and Kasumi (if you get the Stolen Memory DLC.) Your pilot Joker, played by Chris Griffin (Seth Green, but I call him Chris Griffin), is basically comic relief, however he and the banter with the AI is actually pretty funny. You'll encounter your previous ME1 squadmates who won't join you, Liara, Kaidan/Ash, and (if he's alive) Wrex. Wrex and Liara have some good scenes, but Kaidan or Ash... don't. The Illusive Man, who's the head honco of Cerberus and awesomely played by Martin Sheen, is probably one of my favorite villians of all time. All the characters are well written, are well voice played, and I can't really hate these characters. My personal favorites are Garrus and Tali.Criticisms? There are some kinda baffling plot details, Shepard's revival making no sense being my biggest complaint. The scanning minigame I mentioned earlier isn't very fun. There's hacking, which I hear a lot of people hate, I didn't... that much, at least, but I see where people come from when they say it's lame. Also, there aren't very many weapons, which is kind of lame, to be honest.Still, this is an awesome game that everyone should play in their lifetime. 10/10, if you have the money, buy it. Now. Get the other two games in the trilogy as well, ME1 is on Steam as well, but you have to deal with Origin for ME3.			",135,34,1,17,20,0,12

 Mass Effect 2  This is not a ordinary game, it is a masterpiece. I personally went through all the parts and it is one of the best series for me. Mass Effect 2 is a continuation of Commander Shepard's story. This time our hero is rescued by Cerberus and with the help of the Illusive Man and the team of humans and aliens our aim will be to stop attacks on human colonies in the Terminus System. The game offers a great soundtrack, character, ship and squad development, travels through the Milky Way galaxy, and performs a great story and loyalty missions, side missions and resource gathering and many interesting characters and planets. For me it is not just a game it is a masterpiece that everyone should experience. Production in which for the first time our choices matter. If you have not played yet, you definitely should.

												It's  lower than the first... The plot is less epic (except the final)There are less skillsThere are less weaponsThere is less exploration (yes, I miss the Mako :))There is less looting(But the new characters are very interesting )...however it remains above the average of the other games			",145,27,0,27,2,1,8

												This is one of the most epic series of games out there.  This one did a great job of taking the story along and adding elements that can actually lead through multiple playthroughs.I have beaten this game at least twice, as I failed to save my playthough before the third came out.  I spent more than 241 hours in this game and can say that the story, character development, and play style set the bar high for other top tier games coming out.I would definately recommend playing through this and the third if you have not.  One of the most epic games of all time.			",170,56,2,50,63,1,77

												This game along with ME1 and ME3 has taken up so much of my life i expect to turn around and see Vorcha in the streets or events of the Shadow Broker on the radio and events from Omega on the news with cover ups of the Collectors.Do NOT buy this game if you value your sanity as it literally breaks you. The friendships you build makes you pissy at the real friends you have as they dont live up to those of Garrus and his quirky remarks.On a serious not though, there is so many different paths to go down with this game with decisions you make in ME1 having the capability to be butterfly effected right through.

Definitively RecommendedOne of the most amazing games I've ever played. Mass Effect 2 (And the entire trilogy - in general) gives you an epic space experience. Be the badass Shepard of your dreams and go Renegade. Or be a nice, peaceful Shepard and go Paragon. You can choose many different choices that >will< affect the story later on. And whats epic is - it has dynamic endings, which means your endings are based on what choices you make and what you do (I am serious on this). Cons*Awesome space experience!*Romance - You can even romance a cricket hitman! (Not literally a cricket, but close enough). *Numerous charcter-creation and choices, lots of classes and the ability to give your character *some backstory. *Heart-touching story.*Lots of dialouge and dialogue options. *Rich story.*Paragon/Renegade system. *Dynamic story-line and ending (Your choices affect how the story goes and how it ends).*Slightly more content than Mass Effect 3 (Resource gathering is something Mass Effect 3 doesn't have). Cons *No Mako. Sadly this wonderful vehicle isn't drive-able in Mass Effect 2. *Scary flying horrifying Scythe♥♥♥♥♥♥ *Confusing covers and controls. Ratings!  Aspect Rating   Graphics 8.1/10   Gameplay 7.9/10   SFX 8.9/10   Story 9.2/10 Overall - 9/10 ",54,5,0,7,5,1,4

												IF you didn't buy this when it was on sale make sure you do next time, BUT make sure that you buy Mass Effect and play it first. The gameplay in ME2 is much smoother and will make ME feel really dated and clunky in comparison imo. Many people like the more RPG aspects and upgrading of weapons in ME, but I found ME2 to be more streamlined and perfectly fine. The gameplay and combat I defintiely like better. I fell in love with all of my crew and couldn't wait for ME3. I also highly recommend the DLCs for Kasumi, and the Shadow Broker DLCs as they add a decent sized quests for SB, and add a phenomenal member to your crew with Kasumi, not to mention one of the best weapons in the game.Note that if you want to play the Mass Effect series you really should start at ME and go through all 3. The games are tied closely toether with decisions from previous games and to get the full experience you need to actually partake in it from the beginning! From people that you save and will remain with you until the end, to romances you have that can chancge the way crew members feel about you. If done properly things you did in ME will shcarry all the way over to ME3. It truly is an amazing accomplishment I think for this series and as a gamer consider it a must play series. Of course you can find save files around the net that can be placed in the game folders to pretend that you played MAss Effect already with the decisions you wanted, but that's pretty lame isn't it? haha			",554,280,18,56,35,8,38

												One of my favorite game ever. The mass effect saga knows how to make you feel, I can tell you that. ME2 is probably the best of the trilogy, with an amazing gameplay, lot of content, and a few cool DLCs (but expensive). If you buy it during steam sales, it's totally worth the prize.

												Mass Effect is one of my favorite games of the past decade. Despite its technical shortcomings, BioWare's first in what it promised to be a trilogy took the role-playing genre to new cinematic heights. Mass Effect 2 is a better game in near every way. From the very first scene, you will be hooked. And the farther you dive into this epic action role-playing game, the better it gets. It fulfills the promise of its predecessor while continuing to push the boundaries of what we should expect in a videogame. and the MUSIC=SUPERB			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Easily my favourite game of all times and personally the best game off the series because of its good gameplay and story and one thing I really like about this game is that you can import you ME1 character to ME2 so what ever choices you made in the first game will effect some things in the second game.I rate this game 10/10			",54,10,1,3,3,1,2

												Quite possibly one of the best games I've ever played in my life.  With a very thrilling and immersive storyline, bioware made a masterpiece with this series.  Too bad origin wont let us have ME 3 on steam.  Regardless, I wish I could wipe my memory of this game, and the others, just so that I could rediscover the love I have for this game all over again.  Though the gameplay differs from Mass Effect one, the characters still capture your heart with their enchanting personalities, and the storyline you so love progresses onward to the climax in Mass Effect 3, where the culmination of your decisions in the first two second games finally form together. The very fact that this is a dynamic storyline spanning three games with each decision dramatically affecting scenarios in each game is simply incredible. I dont just recommend this game, I'm telling you to get this game. Now shoo, go get this game! (and the first one too...you wont understand this one otherwise)			",151,11,3,15,3,1,8

I do enjoy the personal story and writing, but overall ME1 is still the best.			",271,105,17,29,14,1,38

												Mass Effect 2 hat es bei Release im Jahr 2010 auf Anhieb in meine persönlichen Top 10 der Games geschafft, die ich in all den Jahren gespielt habe.Optisch ist das Spiel dank Unreal Engine ganz gut gealtert. In seltenen Fällen stört der für diese Engine gewohnte, übermässige Glanzeffekt, welcher selbst an Stoffen auftritt ( aktuelles Beispiel: Batman Arkham Knight bei Joker's Verbrennungsszene ). Beim Missionsdesign bemüht man sich im Vergleich zum Vorgänger um Abwechslung - insgesamt gelingt das auch, wenn man mal von dem Planetengescanne absieht. Mich persönlich hat es nie gestört.Was dieses Spiel so herausragend macht, ist die grandiose Inszenierung. Die Story ( die gemeinsam mit dem ebenfalls empfehlenswerten Teil 1 ein großes Ganzes bildet, welches im März 2012 seinen krönenden, aber auch kontroversen Abschluß mit Teil 3 fand ), das intuitive Kampfsystem, die eingstreuten Zwischensequenzen, der ohrwurmverdächtige Soundtrack & die liebgewonnenen Charaktere, das alles fügt sich so gut ineinander, dass man unbedingt wissen möchte wie es weitergeht.Beim ersten Durchgang habe ich Mass Effect 2, abgesehen von den Collector´s Edition DLCs, ohne jeglichen Zusatzcontent gespielt, den es mittlerweile gibt & die Story ergibt auch so 100% Sinn. Man verpasst also nichts. An Spieldauer werden einem rund 30 Stunden geboten, wenn man nur strikt der Hauptgeschichte folgt.  Allerdings verpasst man dann vieles von den Quests der Nenebchraktere & wird das große Finale je nach Verbesserungen des Schiffes relativ einsam bestreiten müßen.Aber: Man muß sich, wie auch schon bei Dragon Age: Origins, mit seinem Bioware- bzw. EA-Account einloggen , um die DLCs nutzen zu dürfen. Mass Effect 2 bietet sogar einige kostenfreie DLCs, welche insgesamt unterhaltsam sind & die Story bereichern. Gerade die DLCs, welche einiges an Story mitbringen ( Kasumi, Shadow Broker,)  sollte man gespielt haben.			",1403,546,69,212,174,15,259

												Mass Effect 2 is a great game, a fun story that drags you along and engulfs you, but has a few plot holes in the context of the series story. The Shooting and combat were fine tuned and made excellent at the cost of more of the RPG elements of the first game. The tone of the story shifts from the world building and hard sci-fi of an Asamov novel to the more adventurous and fast paced sci-fi of a John Scalzi one. This is not a criticism as I enjoy both, just be aware of the change in tone if comming in from the first title.  ",184,39,0,29,5,2,17

												The original Mass Effect was something of an enigma when it came out in 2007. Then an Xbox 360 exclusive, Bioware’s tried and true Knights of the Old Republic character development formula mixed with an action-oriented shooter setup. You could spend time grinding, and yet it still boiled down to aiming a gun and pulling the trigger. You could pump all the points in the world into increasing your health, but forget to take cover and it’d all be for naught. While most hybrid games lean a little bit more in one direction, Mass Effect stood stubbornly on the fence between shooter and RPG.It seems that the complaints – which were at the time, minimal – about Mass Effect‘s indecisive design really got to Bioware. Nearly every issue the community seemed to have with the game has been fixed. The number-crunching RPG elements are gone. The floaty Mako driving segments are gone. The barren side-quest worlds are gone. The indecipherable inventories are gone. The cutting and trimming has left Mass Effect 2 in a rare situation: a genre shift. Granted, at first glance everything seems to be in order; however, when the rubber hits the road and it’s time to play, the game feels very, very different.Mass Effect 2 is no longer an RPG. At least, it’s not an RPG in the sense that the first one was. There is now a simple skill tree system instead of a fully blown stat sheet, and the action now plays out like a third-person tactical shooter. What remains of Mass Effect is the excellent conversation system. The already impressive presentation has also gotten an upgrade, leaving the first Mass Effect behind in a trail of dust. It’s really quite bizarre to see a sequel to a game so well received to change so much.Honestly, though, for as many things Bioware changed, the game still feels solidly planted in the universe Mass Effect presented. Even if the gameplay is different, everything has a sense of familiarity, right down to the synth-infused soundtrack and 1970s aesthetic. Mass Effect 2‘s story picks up two years after the end of the first game. By default, Shepard’s choices left the Council to die, putting humanity in control of the galactic government. Importing a save from Mass Effect is a much-touted feature; however, the timespan between the two games makes the impact of Shepard’s earlier choices fairly minimal. It might be nice to see an old friend or two, though.Instead of continuing the story directly, Mass Effect 2 is the start of a new conflict between Commander Shepard and a new enemy. After being attacked by an unknown vessel in the fringes of space, Shepard is killed while attempting to save his crew. Brought back to life by The Illusive Man, the leader of a human-supremacist organization called Cerberus, Shepard is tasked with unraveling the mystery behind The Collectors – a race of aliens that are showing up in human colonies and stealing away their inhabitants. It makes for a much darker adventure than the first game, taking you to planets around the♥♥♥♥♥end of the Milky Way to construct a team of the best possible warriors to confront this threat.The characters are the game. Building this team isn’t just one quest; it’s the lifeblood of Mass Effect 2. Each one out of the twelve (thirteen, sort of) characters has a lengthy story to tell, and there are dozens of side characters with almost as much detail. The game builds a rich history for each person, making the time spent with them much more interesting than the original six party members from Mass Effect. In action, the game plays like a story-oriented tactical shooter, funneling Shepard and his entourage through conversations and choices before plunging them into firefights and chase sequences. Shepard can take cover behind walls and other objects, popping out to blast a few rounds into enemies before ducking back down. Instead of Mass Effect‘s infinite ammunition, Shepard’s guns take “thermal clips” of energy that effectively work like magazines in any other shooter. Different types of ammo can be loaded into guns, tailored to damage different kinds of enemies. Biotic and Tech powers are now hotkeys that can be pressed to unleash instant attacks on foes, ranging from physics manipulation to active camouflage.Off the battlefield, The Normandy spaceship has received an overhaul, acting as much more of a hub than it did in the original game. The huge cast of characters can be spoken to, and some will offer suggestions for ship upgrades, or reveal personal missions they’d like Shepard to take them on. The Normandy feels more alive than it ever did in Mass Effect, thanks in part to frivolous additions like Shepard’s quarters and bathrooms, as well as background characters that provide endless chatter. It’s the little details that count; even the elevators are gone, replaced with – shocking, I know – loading screens, which take about a third of the time to complete than any lift ride did in the first game.Still, with all of these atmospheric expansions, it’s clear that the actual game has been trimmed quite a bit. Instead of allowing Shepard to hop into the Mako buggy and drive all over random planets, Mass Effect 2 only features a mining minigame, used to find minerals to upgrade various weapons and ship parts. Occasionally, the scanner will yield an anomaly, which translates into a side mission; but for the most part, the planets are there strictly to be combed for resources.While the choices Shepard made in Mass Effect don’t have too much weight, Mass Effect 2‘s own array of decisions are always interesting, and some may lead to intense consequences in Mass Effect 3, if Bioware keeps its word. While the line between Paragon and Renegade is still quite clear, there are many situations where the Paragon sense of charm can be used to do Renegade-ish things, and vice-versa. Shepard can use his charm to convince hostage-takers to drop their weapons in exchange for their lives, only to blast them anyway as soon as they do; likewise, players can threaten prison guards to force them to stop beating a helpless convict. The progression of each conversation feels much more natural in this regard, creating a grey area that Mass Effect often lacked.On the PC, Mass Effect 2 really shines. The interface is slick, allowing players to hotkey their powers; the control scheme is also quite simple by default. It also looks fantastic on PC, and scales fairly well to older computers. At its highest settings on a good gaming rig, the game is a total joy to watch in motion. The gorgeous character models animate perfectly, and the overall direction has taken a step up from its already admirable presence in Mass Effect.Mass Effect 2 is quite clearly the middle game in a trilogy. The actual story takes a backseat to character development, spending 25 hours introducing a motley crew before wrapping everything up with a jaw-dropping final mission and cliffhanger ending. The experience is worth playing through at least twice for the Paragon and Renegade choices; maybe more for those who want to explore every nook and cranny of the game. Mass Effect 2 is a triumph of an action game, blending satisfying shooter levels with dark themes and hours of heated debate.			",2266,868,87,236,310,22,349

												The Mass Effect series has been my all-time favorite video game series ever since the first one.Let's start with the obvious, which are the downsides:Mass Effect 2 is unlike the first one, and consequently is less of a BioWare game at heart than it could be, clearly showing the signs of transition between pre- and post-EA acquisition.World exploration has been highly minimized in favor of action sequences, whether centralizing scenes with shootouts or with much more intense scenarios for the vehicle sections.Going from point A to B revolves more around the action of that path, rather than a combination of full control, observation and going in unprepared.The RPG elements are also dumbed-down, in particular with the equipment by making minimal changes between outfits and weapons, leaving only the character-building experience with dialogue sequences.All this being said: the improvements definitely make up for most — if not all — of these downsides.The enriched universe shown in the first game is still present in this title, which still leaves you with the same amount of awe.The dialogues, despite feeling like two robots speaking to each other most of the time, is filled with character, where each line tells you just enough about the world you're playing in, and they're super well delivered thanks to the amazing voice actors like Jennifer Hale (if you played femshep), or Mark Meer (maleshep), or even the other awesome members of the main cast, including and especially Martin Sheen. Sure, the exchange between two parties doesn't feel like two human beings talking, but their amount of detail definitely make up for this fault.The characters themselves are mostly unique; they have many facets to themselves that are progressively presented to you as you develop tighter bonds with them, and generally never feel unnatural.Finally, despite the locations being abruptly cut in portions (sometimes by giving you menus of where to go next), they don't cut too much to prioritize cinematic display, which although is something inherent in video games nowadays and they're specially gorgeous in this one, is something that easily breaks the pacing. Mass Effect tackles this appropriately since most of the cinematics involve player prompts, so there's never a moment where the game forces you to put down your controller (or stretching yourself in your chair) unless you want it to.All of this while you experience an epic story of a Commander that participates in something much more interesting than a mere ""saving the Galaxy"" (which the 3rd title unfortunately definitely uses as the main theme), by jumping between solar systems.I'm a video games fan, so I'll play mostly anything, even if I end up highly disliking a game; before I judge them critically, I must give all a fair chance by at trying to play it from beginning to end.Mass Effect 2, however, is the only game in my library and past experience that gives me a profound amount of pleasure while playing it.If I was allowed only one part of my memory wiped, I would definitely use that to my memories of this series, so that I could re-experience it ""for the first time"" all over again.

												[UPDATE] And then i got all the content for the game ( not available in steam but throught origin ). In that content is the Project Overlord DLC and OMFG... It realy made me cry. One of the best moments in gaming ever...Amazingly good.Having played Mass Effect 1 through and being a massive fan, I went into the second iteration with enthusiasm.I was severely disapointed by some of the design decision i met there (vs Mass Effect 1):RPG skill system severely dumbed down.Planet exploration turned into horrible annoying mini-game.Third person combat shifted severely into ""gears of war"".Now the good:The game still is one of the best stories ever. The number of time you get goose bumps by what is happening on the screen is breath taking.If you like Bioware Games or even RPGs, this is mandatory to own as is Mass Effect 1.Caveat: Playing the game without doing the first mass effect 1 and then using the save game makes you lose a lot of content. If you are new to the series, play both back to back.RECOMENDED at full price.ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY at 75% off.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Once again, Bioware comes out with a successful 2nd installment in the Mass Effect universe. Removing old features, yet replacing them with more convenient and better ones. The story takes you as Commander Shepard once more, you and your crew have managed to defeat Saren and save The Citadel. Your mighty vessel, the Normandy, is under attack by a Collector ship and you must abort, resulting in many crewmen dead, your companions make it out, but not you. You suffocate in your own suit in the void of space, losing contact with your crew. For the next 2 years, you are taken under safety by Cerberus, a pro-human organization with a shady past but good intentions of saving humanity from the Collectors. Cerberus, has plans for you.PROSImproved Combat System - No overheating, just reloadingEnd game continuation - Unlike in Mass Effect 1 where if you beat the main story, it's over (I hate RPG's that do that♥♥♥♥♥♥ this Mass Effect let's you complete quests and do whatever you want after the main story as if it was just normal.Armor Customization - Very immense and diverse armor customization, each piece is important.Companions - Not one companion seemed to lack any character, you could distinguish each one with ease and it felt like Mass Effect 1 all over again. Each character gives you the chance to gain their loyalty via completing a briefly long story related to their past. Which then most will branch into Romances, more down below.More Romance Choices - Where there were only 3 Romance choices in 1, in 2 there are 9 in total.   MaleshepMiranda LawsonTali'Zorah vas Neema/Normandy (My waifu, kek)Jack FemshepJacob TaylorGarrus VakarianThane Krios Fem/MaleshepKelly ChambersSamaraMorinth(Sorry, can't ♥♥♥♥ a krogan yet...dammit lol)Story - Bioware does an amazing job reeling you into the risks of your mission, becoming attached to the cause every step of the way, keeping you interested.Exploration - Bioware takes a step further with MASSIVE exploration, finding planets and mining them for resources in which you can use to upgrade your abilities, armor, and weapons.The feeling of nostalgia - This one is a personal bit, but I think that if you play Mass Effect 1 and finish it, import your character, and experience Mass Effect 2, it really is an emotional trip. I only managed to beat both Mass Effect 1 and 2 in a span of a month, and I still felt so attached to the characters as if I was waiting for the next Mass Effect game in 2007, it's a great experience.CONSEA - EA decided this time to be more interfering of Mass Effect 2 with you having to make an EA account, you really don't need to make one, but you can if you want more DLC I suppose. I did, and it bugged me every time because I'd have to login every time I played. It's a real shame Bioware is getting flogged by EA so much with RPG's, this comes from their newest Mass Effect: Andromeda, which I have no desire in playing anytime soon if not ever. This is honestly more of a complaint towards EA rather than Bioware.NIT-PICKSSquad Commands - Few moments have I experienced very frustrating squad commanding, It's really nothing to worry about, but it is a slight improvement from Mass Effect 1's squad commanding.Renegade/Paragon choices in dialogue - Bioware adds more to the dialogue system with increased emotion and meaning between Paragon and Renegade. Renegade in my opinion is the coolest way to go, but because of my general kindness towards people, I always go Paragon. Best way to approach this system is to just play the game how you would play in a real situation. Get immersive, it's an RPG after all.Controls - The controls for keyboard are a bit strange, but you can easily find a mod such as Intuitive Controls mod to fix it.Graphics - Graphics aren't bad, there good, they can be better with ALOT (A Lot Of Textures) for Mass Effect 2Origin - Origin is a client based PC gaming service distributed by EA and is used to sell and digitally distribute EA's published games, it's an ok service, but it's a shame that they never decided to bring Mass Effect 3 here on Steam. So if your done with Mass Effect 1 and 2 like me and want to play 3, Origin is your only option. I look to add Mass Effect 3 somehow on steam via non steam game and will do screenshots to show more of my adventures.Mass Effect 2 is a great sequel to the legendary first one, definetly recommend it to anyone looking for a great RPG series.

												I wasn't at all a fan of how many of the RPG elements of the first game got axed, and the switch to a more shooter-centric combat system made the already strict freedom of movement feel even more constrained. The story and character development is rather jarring compared to the first as well, but is totally self-redeeming and very much worth it. In the end, this game somehow managed to finish with even more of an addictive quality than the first. The thing that makes the series really great is how important it makes your actions feel. They have weight, you get to see their effects, and the story remains very engaging and powerful.			",418,117,8,60,37,4,108

												Bioware has alwyas been a wonderful company since Baldur's Gate UNTIL they got bought by the worst software company the world has seen ELECTRONIC ARTS.The game is very good and will give you very good moments. Sadly one has to include the ELECTRONIC ARTS experience in the equation and it can go somewhat smooth (where your DLCs work sometimes or you have to visit pretty bad designed with new passwords and registrations and some DLC work some others not or you might be unlucky and you have to deal with a BUG. Not any kind of bug, but an ELECTRONIC ARTS bug, where you will have to visit painful webpages asking things one time and the other for some ridiculous♥♥♥♥♥♥and maybe find a patch only to realize that although you have FIBER it is like you are in the 90s with a 9600 baud modem and downloading a patch file from EA servers takes TWO HOURS, i repeat TWO HOURS for a 70 Mb file.One can only hope that ELECTRONIC ARTS closes and stop destroying so many wonderful companies that end in their deadly incompetent hands.Where are you my dear Westwood? Where are you Bioware? Just names now. Oh my dear Dune2. Ok i am crying now. People please leave me alone. /hides.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't even know where to start. At first I thought I'd get a typical space adventure with laser beams and stuff, but what I actually got was beyond all my expectations. First of all the story is great. It keeps gradually developing between the games and keeps the player intrigued at all times. We all have played at least one of those games that keep you wide awake through the whole night, and this truly is one of those. Even after finishing the game there are loads of fascinating lore waiting to be read and trust me, it's worth it.Sadly if you're not interested in talking to people wholeheartedly or just don't care about the dialogue that much, you'll miss most of the game's charm since most of the important stuff happen during conversations. Some things tend to get complicated really fast if you decide to skip even a few important dialogues. And sometimes just listening to random NPCs was enough to keep me entertained, even if it didn't have anything to do with the mission itself. The amount of work that has been put into the dialogue really pays off, and I barely remember times when talking with someone didn't put a smile on my face.Probably the thing that made the game for me were the characters. I found something intriguing in all of them (even if Kelly Chambers deserves death for ""you have new messages"" when there are none) and I couldn't wait for getting to do their loyalty missions and actually making them my friends rather than just comrades during the war. Only some of them started to grow on me. The more I talked with them the more I started to love them to bits... especially Tali, Garrus and Mordin. I actually started to feel like I wanted to keep them alive and protect them at all costs, and that's when you know they're well made.After playing the first game the controls feel so smooth and not complicated at all, so there's nothing to complain about. During combat the only flaw I found was that at times Shepard seemed to be unable to follow the instructions and just died without jumping over a simple obstacle, but those things happen. Also the AI might seem a bit idiotic, but that probably can be corrected by choosing a higher difficulty setting.And oh god, the replay value. The possibilities are almost endless when it comes to how you want to play. Different classes, gender, decisions, romances... everything can be played differently and affects things in different ways. In most games the only thing you can affect is whether you want to be the good samaritan or not, and that's it. This is the first time I've ever felt that by replaying I might actually achieve something I didn't the last time I played, even if it'd take another 30 hours of my life.The graphics were really good too, even if Bioware still tends to overuse the blur effect. Overall the game is pretty and really pleases the eye. There simply aren't reasons why someone shouldn't at least try the game out - except if you aren't ready for the bumpy ride Mass Effect 1 first wants to offer you. tl;dr Awesome calibrating simulator. 95/100			",80,30,1,18,8,0,5

												9/10 Overview RPG/Third Person Shooter The Good: + 6 Character builds to choose from: Soldier, Infiltrator, Vanguard, Engineer, Biotic, and Adept. Each one specializes in different abilities, skills, weapons and each class feels distinct. + The combat is excellent as each weapon feels different, the controls are tight and the third person cover and shooting mechanics are solid.  + Both artistically and technically the game is visually appealing especially when you visit outdoor locations. I particularly like how each of the major cities in the game feel distinct from one another. The bright/light colors of Illium contrast the dark red hues on Omega for example. Just by the appearance of certain locations you can easily get an understanding of what the place is about and what to expect.  +Like the first mass effect, the scope of game is equally impressive. Everything this game has to offer, the characters, races, locations, missions, cities, etc is designed to make you feel like you are part of an epic science fiction adventure.+The story is more self contained than the first and third game, it certainly doesn't feel as big in scope to the other entries but that doesn't make it is any less interesting or fun. The story focuses more on individual characters rather than a grand narrative and because the characters are so good it makes the overall game better.  +Bioware's strength is writing detailed, interesting characters and this game is no different. The NPC's that you find and join you are some of the most interesting characters you will find in the entire series. Speaking to them and learning about their lives is interesting and adds an extra layer of believability. +Arguably the single greatest improvement over the first game is the side quests. This time around they are varied, fun , provide interesting back-story to many of the characters and locations and overall make you feel like you are part of a much larger universe. Side quests come in two types. The first is loyalty missions for your crew aboard the Normandy. These missions flesh out more of the characters history and most of the time involve you shooting many enemies. The second type involves you scanning planets to find an anomaly which leads you to the planet's surface to investigate. Most of the time these mission are self contained, however sometimes these types of missions will lead to other side missions. +Soundtrack and special effects. The Average:Probably one of my bigger disappointments with the game is the lack of rpg elements. Rather than improve some of the mechanics of the first game (inventory, UI, exploring planet on vehicle etc.) Bioware simply removed them completely. Even the character classes themselves have been streamlined with each class only have 4-5 skills. The game could be considered a third person shooter with some rpg elements rather than a full blown rpg. Its great that your choices from the first game carry over. It adds a bit of continuity to the story. The problem however, these choices don't really amount to anything other than a few changes in dialogue. In would have been nice if the choices you made had a much bigger impact in the following games. The citadel is suppose to be the major hub of the galaxy where all the trading and races come together, yet the design of the citadel feels small and cheap compared to the first game. The citadel is a few floors consisting of shops The series STILL lacks of controller supportA few crashes  The Bad:- This is more a fault on EA than the game. Under normal circumstances, when you buy a game on Steam with any dlc or bonuses everything gets downloaded at once, at least that is what I thought. Not with this game. In order to get any of the DLC, you first have to create an account with EA, log into the bioware social website, download each individual piece of dlc and then install each one separately....Thanks EA. - The game introduces planet scanning to find resources. These resources are used to upgrade weapon damage, biotic powers, upgrade the Normandy etc. This itself would not be a problem except for the fact that scanning planets is repetitive and boring. You are commander Shepard savior of the galaxy, speaking to different races, saving people, exploring planets, fighting dangerous missions... and all of that comes to a grinding halt when you have to stop and scan planets to upgrade anything. It sounds like something that was good on paper but failed in execution. -I found it odd that the only way to compare weapons is by reading the weapon description. There is no way to compare weapon damage, rate of fire, reload speed, etc.ConclusionThis is a worthy sequel to an already great game. I just wish they didn't have to sacrifice so many RPG elements to make it.  ",731,344,32,73,63,8,96

												Bioware did some big favours for themselves with this release.The combat has been completely redone which was my biggest complaint about ME1, and while it still isn't as satisfying as a dedicated TPS like say, Resident Evil or Max Payne, its an admirable effort for a hybrid RPG, and most especially from a studio that's usually stuck to D&Desque rules for combat.The graphics, style and presentation have all been kicked up a notch, and the world and scope of the game has been vastly expanded.The story however, is a little underwhelming, and almost insignificant compared to the first game. Where ME1 was concerned with the almost extinction of all sentient life in the galaxy by an ancient evil force, ME2 is about some kind of splinter remnants kidnapping a few hicks on the outskirts of space AND ONLY YOU CAN STOP THEM.More than that though, the structure of the story is a bit too straightforward. The game is about recruiting people in your team, and then going to kill the bad guys. That's basically it.It's a bit unfair to simplify the game as such, as there is some decent writing concerning your ship mates (some of which return from ME1). And the presentation and emotional investment of the final mission in the game really is quite an experience.There's plenty of content to be had, with my blind insanity playthrough being almost 50 hours. However this is including all the side missions, which consists of exploring lots of boring empty space for a blip on a radar, that leads to an underwhelming and somewhat pointless mission (usually just give you some negligable amounts of money and xp)As a sequel, the game is a fantastic continuance of Shephard's journey, but on its own merits as both a TPS and an RPG, it may leave some people wanting.

												TL;DR A worthy sequel to ME1. The grittier feel extends to all areas, including a shift from 'futuristic blue' menus to 'diarrhea yellow' menus. The simplified mechanics are a mixed blessing.Mass Effect 2 is very much the 'gritty second installment' of the Mass Effect series. Think The Empire Strikes Back compared to A New Hope - the whole game takes a darker tone, from the locations you visit, the characters you meet, the urgency of the story and the significance of the choices you make. A warning, though - there is much more language and blood/violence.Due to a surprise attack by an unknown spaceship at the beginning of the game, you are forced to work for the pro-human activists Cerberus. Remember those guys from the first game? They did genetic experiments on aliens and killed a pro-alien human officer who got in their way. Things are a little awkward as you, erstwhile saviour of the galaxy take up arms alongside the space-Nazis.Having defeated the lone Reaper in the first game, the Council believes that the Reaper threat is over, and refuses to acknowledge there are more out there. However, since they are sending their minions to capture human colonies, Cerberus sends you to investigate. In the course of your adventure, you visit all sorts of places, from the poorer areas of the Citadel to the Krogan homeworld, the corrupt but glamourous Asari world of Illium and even the notorial criminal capital of Omega. You recruit a new team, composed of some of your old comrades, but also a whole host of new characters. Some of the new characters are not as developed as the old ones, but on the whole, the calibre of storytelling is consistent.The combat system has been completely revamped, and the controls alone can take a couple of levels to get used to, but overall, they're mostly an improvement, as things are generally simplified. The loot/inventory system has also been changed. Instead of picking up millions of useless weapons, you research new types at your ship, which can then be used by anyone. The weapons are all subtly different, even within a certain type - ie, instead of each successive sniper being marginally more powerful, the first is a standard rifle, the second is a higher capacity one which fires 3 shots at once (useful for groups) and the third is a slow firing but amazingly powerful anti-material rifle.A new feature is research. In a special lab in your ship, you are able to research upgrades for you and your squadmates weapons, armour and abilities. Armour upgrades are different, in that you can switch components like your helmet, shoulder pads, leg armour, etc for ones with different bonuses, rather than the whole suit at once. You can also buy research from shops, unlike the first, where I never used a shop at all!Research takes minerals/rare metals, and this leads us to one of the worst elements of the game. Mining. You take the ship into orbit, and fire probes at a planet until it's depleted. Over. And over. And over again. I preferred the Mako.The game has also been divided up into 'hub' type areas, where no enemies ever appear, and 'mission' areas, where everyone you meet is an enemy. I feel this is a bit of a step backwards. Fortunately the tactical combat part of the game is significantly better, so fighting is much more enjoyable.One of the best bits of the game is the final mission. it, again, follows a general storyline, but depending upon choices you made during the game and during the last mission itself, there are any number of interesting variables. One interesting thing is that you can die and still beat the game...I've not seen that often in video games.			",41,2,2,2,2,0,6

												Mass Effect 2 was a great game.  The mechanics changed a bit from one, and at first I was dissapointed at the loot system change.  I did get over it.  I did get annoyed by the fact that the only way to access the squad skills and journals was by hiting escape.  Why not keep the same keyboard layout as the last game.  Ohwell Story was great, the AI did a good job of fighting with the occasional went behind cover that hindered any view of the fight making them a little useless at times, however commanding them to move locations would overcome this problem.   I look forward to Mass Effect 3 that I just picked up...			",181,40,1,26,15,3,43

												And so i sit here at the end of the Mass effect Trilogy with manly tears in my eyes :'( and a large amounts of joy in my heart :D . What a ride... What a ride.... i'll keep spoilers to a minimum but by the Protheans what a tale. This isn't like Fallout 4 in which all of the character are paper thin. There is real emotion and story behind each character my personal favourites being well, ALL of them! :D . The gameplay gets better and better with each game all complex but concise and easy to understand. The Plot, well let's just say the council should have listened and heeded the warnings ;) . As for Mass Effect 2, i believe that this is the best out of the series. There are minimal faults in this game and possibly the best plot out of the trilogy as well. And don't even get me started about Suicide Mission probably the pinicle of the series. The combat is great in comparison to Mass Effect 1 with a few tweaks and advancements here and there. However the star of the show is the interaction between you, your squadmates and the crew. So much depth to everyone whilst adding a few new characters here and there. Solid 9.5/10. Go do yourself a favour, buy the Trilogy and experience the Mass Effect universe a story like no other.			",86,4,0,6,8,0,7

												What can I say about my favourite saga until now.  I would not recommend anyone to play Mass Effect 2 if they have not played Mass Effect 1 first. The storytelling is impressive, graphics are very good in spite of being a game from 2010 and each character has his/her own charming. The many possibilities of playing this game is what makes it even more amazing, you can build your own story ina  positive or a negative way. I mean, of course you can lose some of your crew but it would be because of the decision you have taken. I cannot say much more about this fantastic game and saga because i can't see a single coun of playing this game and getting involved by this universe. Totally recommended.			",600,208,31,63,46,6,74

												Like it's predecessor, Mass Effect 2 does not dissapoint with it's stellar storyline and delivery. Top tier voice actors, and simply the *best* storyline out of *any* RPG game out on console and PC. ME2 improves on everything about ME1. Giving the game a more fast paced feel to it. They cut back a tad on the RPG aspect, but not in a bad way at all. I reccomend the entire Mass Effect series. 1-3. For any RPG gamer who appreciates a game with an excellent story, interactive characters, and just good ol' shooting fun-- the Mass Effect series is the perfect fusion of the two, for you to receive optimal enjoyment.

Rank: 9/10Recommendation(s): Play Mass Effect 1 to port your gameplay results to change plot, port saves into that legal copy of Mass Effect 3 on Steam, and play with 3D Vision assisted by Helix Mod.Major Theme: Well balanced Sci-Fi RPG designed and built by Bioware with  just enough EA meddling.Bought at Price: $35 (for Mass Effect 1 and Mass Effect 2 Deluxe)Bioware is an interesting studio. They have pushed out some very note worthy titles such as SWKOTOR (Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic) and Dragon Age: Origins. They are both worth a go, but are not for ""modern"" gamers who like action packed games.If you have played Mass Effect 1, you will find that Bioware had moved on from the classical ""RPG"" elements such as attributes (Dexterity, Strength, etc.) and inventory (limited slots, customization items take space). You will also discover that you can port your save game data and input the results to affect gameplay in Mass Effect 2.The stripping of core RPG mechanics was done to allow for as many people to enjoy the game as possible. The plot was re-designed to make it more action packed. The 3 plot necessities were focused, being: gore, sex, and humour. This unfortunately causes a problem for some; there's more on this later.


I think this planned... Somehow...

The result was a much more interesting, action packed title which should allow anyone to play it.You should however, take into account that Unreal 3 is more of a console porting engine. You can see this with the lower quality textures, limits on the detail of scenes, field of view (FOV), hidden frame rate smoothing, and loading in between decks of the Normandy.


Mass Effect 2

When I think of consoles, one of the first things I think of is DLCs. While I describe them to be the evil of all evils to some, there are some ok ""patches"" such as the Shadow Broker, which adds to the story, save porting abilities, and even highlights the back story that I wasn't aware of from the comics. Another issue with porting is that meaningful keyboard shortcuts and keys are not used. This is where the concept of ""spacebar does everything"" comes in. While most games use the ""e"" key for interactions (failing that, the ""f"" key), Mass Effect 2 uses the spacebar. This is quite the switch from the original Mass Effect.Comparing to another successful title such as Dragon Age: Origins, you can see how the game has improved and worsened.Improvements range from not being so dry thanks to humour, to less about fine tuning character attributes and more enjoying the story.The list of things that you can say have become worse include: ""The getting laid simulator"" romance mechanic, the plot is too simple, and that the game is generally ""dumbed down"".Side Note: It should be up to you to evaluate what is important to you, but I will make as side note here to say that the game has replay ability. You can even replay Mass Effect to change how the story unfolds in ME2 and ME3.Another point that should be made apparent is that the 80% process is used.Due to the 80% process, cut scenes don't use weapons assigned by you. While not a “game breaking” issue, just could have been worth the weight (thanks gabe for the comment). In this process, studios finish things to 80% and move on, hoping to come back and finish them later. Sadly, most of the time this means picking the more meaningful features before shipment.Stereoscopic 3D done via Nvidia's 3D vision and improved via Helix Mod, really make this title a treat and greatly improve immersion.To end this off I will say this. The beauty of Mass Effect 2 (as with the others) is that you can play a different style or character the next playthough. Go with male Shepard once, then with the Female another. Things change, and thus I have played 4 times all the way though. Yes, you will feel like doing that one day. Maybe Romance Tali in one, Garrus the 2nd, or Miranda in the 3rd.

												The essential link between Mass Effect and Mass Effect 3. Mass Effect 2 is less focused on the general story background, but puts building a team and relationships into the focus of its story line. Apart from the introduction of the ""Collectors"", there's isn't much added to what has been learned about the reapers in Mass Effect 1.Mass Effect 2 is best enjoyed with an imported save game, giving away bits and pieces about what happened to all the colorful persons the payer met in the first game. Combat has been drastically simplified, giving way less emphasize on building the character and outfitting them with gear. With speed of the encounters picking up, the tactical impact of squad utilization has been dropped seomwhat in favor of putting the player's reaction time more into focus. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but won't appeal to those who wish for a less hectic approach to combat.While enjoying ME 2 greatly at the first time, I personally didn't find the second playthrough of ME 2 as rewarding as it felt for ME 1, because of the rather thin story development. While building relationships with the NPCs feels rewarding, it comes somewhat short in terms of depths. Less squad mates with more character development would have been preferable.Bottom line: Essential to (re)live the trilogy, but feels slightly like a stretch for those who already know about the dramatic developments of ME 3.PS: Don't miss updating the game with a HD texture modification! Due to technical limitations the developers did include low res textures only! The screenshots I have taken showcase HD textures for all squadmates. IMPORTANT:  Despite being published by EA, Mass Effect 2 DOES NOT require Origin to play. BUT: You are able to register your Steam copy of ME 2 at Origin as well, which enables you to download the DLC you're already eligible for by purchasing the special edition of the game.

												While I don't have much Steam time on this game, I took the fight to the Collectors plenty from a retail disc. Great Cinema. Great tatooes! Sex with aliens! What more could you ask for? The move and shoot dynamics suck and the levels while beautiful are very small, thus it is weak on the 'game' side of the ledger. The game mechanics are not great but the STORY IS. For $5 on sale you would be mad not to get it. If you are a masochist you can also check the Bioware homepage where where there is plenty of overpriced DLC that they really should be giving away much cheaper.			",274,46,4,79,28,2,88

												Mass Effect 2 is just a great game, with very few draw-backs. If you haven't played the first Mass Effect game, go play it! If it weren't for the b*llsh*t DLC situation, Mass Effect 2 would easily be worth the standard retail price.You can view the opening of the game here.Presumed dead by the Alliance, Shepard is given backing by the human-first extremist group Cerberus to investigate a strange phenomenon: whole Alliance colonies are simply disappearing. Investigating the disappearing colonies and a strange new enemy are the primary missions of the game that stretch from beginning to end; it's the core narrative that makes the game work. Within that framework, you as Shepard put together a combat team of the galaxy's most elite operatives - literally a sort of intergalactic ""Dirty Dozen."" Each team-member has a recruitment mission (required if you want them in your squad) and loyalty mission (not required, but ignore at your own risk!) The final mission is a masterpiece of programming and pacing. You'll want as many squad-mates as possible. Who is loyal and who isn't is a crucial factor in determining who lives or dies. Choosing the wrong squad-mates for support duty as Shepard and 2 others fight the (very creepy) final boss can result in more deaths. Decision making and laying the groundwork (ie loyalty) are crucial. Choices made throughout the game were never more consequential.The graphics still look great for a 2010 game. The music soundtrack is superb. There are some new minigames, like hacking wall safes and datapads. Both are fairly easy and don't slow down game-play that much. Scanning planets for resources, quickly devolves into a chore; you have to do it, though, to research improvements for your ship, guns, and armor. Planetary exploration from the first game is gone, which was disappointing to me. There are a LOT of side-missions, which are great if you just want to tool around the galaxy looking for stuff to do. And, yes, squad-mate romance is back. An added bonus are some fantastic actors to voice important characters, including Martin Sheen as The Illusive Man (yes, THAT Martin Sheen!), Yvonne Strahovski as Cerberus officer Miranda Lawson (from the TV show Chuck), and Carrie-Ann Moss as Omega gangster / ruler Aria T'Loak (Trinity from The Matrix). While the first Mass Effect was a great RPG, Mass Effect 2 focuses more on story and action at the expense of customization. It's like watching a favorite movie play out, except you are IN the movie, making the choices. A great story-based and combat-based RPG / FPS hybrid with high replayability. One of my all time favorites! Because of the DLC situation, though, only purchase the game when on sale at 75% off.A note about DLC:The DLC situation is, frankly, b*llsh*t. Once the game is fully assembled it is truly superb; but save your money and get the game on sale, because to acquire ALL the DLC will cost around $40 at this point.The Digital Deluxe Edition includes the Cerberus Network Add-on. The Cerberus Network provides access to the following DLC: Zaeed - The Price of RevengeFirewalker PackNormandy Crash SiteCerberus Arc ProjectorCerberus Weapons and ArmorThe Cerberus Network requires that you to create a profile on Bioware's Social website. Once your purchase of the Mass Effect 2 Digital Deluxe Edition is verified, you will be provided links to download .exe files (hosted on EA's severs) that will install the DLC. These will work on a Steam installation, and do NOT require the installation EA's Origin software. Purchasing additional DLC (which can be done on the Bioware Social website) follows the same pattern.			",308,121,22,53,56,2,74

												This game is the second part of an awesome trilogy. It improves upon the first game greatly and has managed to succeed in surpassing it through its epic story, fantastic characters, and enjoyable gameplay. It is well worth the time and money and should be played by all.			",164,20,2,28,8,2,16

												Mass Effect 2, I can't describe how much i love this game. It's the second chapter of the epic Mass Effect series. It's the best sequel and one of the greatest games made of all time, which continues the epicness that Mass Effect 1 had. BioWare did a really great job, everything is done well! Fantastic unique characters, awesome atmosphere, great story, beautiful well-made world that you will get into, improved gameplay and combat system. I highly recommend Mass Effect 2 and the whole Mass Effect series for every gamer and fan of RPGs. If you liked the first game, then you should play this one. I have finished the game many times, and I will gladly play and finish it many times again!One of the greatest games ever made and A MUST-HAVE FOR EVERYONE!			",147,46,3,36,5,4,7

												Have you ever wanted to be the captain of a space ship but Star Trek is too nerdy for you? Well now you are in EA Presents Bio BeWare Mass Effect 2: Axe Effect. Take on the role of commander Shepard and be you in space. Or be Shepard in space. It’s whatever. Best friend of waist high walls, you shoot your OWN path through predestined story missions. Talk to some bros and listen to banter in space in this Sci Fi mans shooter. In space, all of the shooters are mans. There are aliens that don’t look like mans but they don’t shoot thank goodness. I really get to feel like it’s cold blood murder in space and the action is visceral even when poor humanoid robots shoot me. To be fair there are also space spiders and space dogs so geeze I guess it’s not a total copy and paste skeleton job!The gameplay is cover man shooting but it is also talking to people in towns and making numbers get bigger. You will be playing an RPG sometimes, but then you are working for the establishment  and gunning down mens next thing you know. What genre of game are you even playing? We’ve all played a game before so the rest of this review is not about gameplay.The star of the show is codex talk man. At any time you can pause to stop playing the ♥♥♥♥ing game and go through menus to listen to a smooth talking gentleman chat about the game. You may be familiar with codex from Drag on Age or Final Fantasy XIII 1-3. but this time the codex is the highlight of the game as you sit back and get read the game to you. Over the course of the game you will get more bros for your ship and redder guns but the new codex entries are what pull the player along. For all you creepers out there you can have a romantic relationship with all sorts of space dudes and ladies. But not dude on dude because that is gay. In this Mass Effect no one is gay in space. Except women sometimes. But that’s not gay in space.Resource farming minigame? Lockpick minigame? We got it all here folks! Why don’t you slide up behind a turret or bap some heads off? But before you say seen this and peace out you get psychic abilities. If you are Vanguard (only be Vanguard folks) you can flip guys up to slow motion gravity and be goku instant transmission across the battlefield in space. You get some slaughterpals like Space Mad-Scientist Frog and Bald Girl Wanna Kill Things just to name a couple murderbuddies.Mass Effect 2 has a revolutionary choice-O-meter. You are red or you are blue and you cut yourself off from future opportunity just like in the real world. You can scratch the code off of your Doritos (™) Shepard’s Favorite Chips On The Citadel (™) chips to get more empathy points to spend on your dating harem if you choose to play the game like a weird alcoholic space pimp and not a serious professional going about saving the galaxy. Paragorn Mountain Dew for blue bloods.So strap on your watch which is a computer asap at your your local Valve Steam store. You are the telekinetik undead military captain rockstar and everyone loves you when you pull the trigger in space.

												I have a hard time speaking in a balanced manner about Mass Effect 2 because it's one of my single favorite video games of all-time. There are so many good things to gush over, but the bad pieces are really, truly bad and do a lot to ruin the experience of actually playing the game. The most concise way I can describe it is 'flawed masterpiece'. It's a game propped up by fantastic art and sound design and far better overall writing than the much maligned Mass Effect 3, but at the same time, the gameplay is nowhere near as tight and the overall design is way rougher -- To the point where I'd criticize the combat as being unfinished.To start, the graphics and the engine run pretty smoothly on the PC. It runs easily enough -- I see around 110-120 FPS on my 120hz 1440p monitor, but the textures are often muddy and low-res, a curse of the title being designed with far outdated consoles in mind... Even back in 2010. I had a similar experience with the first Mass Effect, though that game is even rougher-looking than this one is. The textures here are, on average, higher res. It helps that the lighting is far better designed than the first game (goodbye, ham-fisted lens flare!). There are a great many visual bugs, though. Far more than the console version. Glitches with the eyes, characters model inexplicably spinning, etc. But it's saved mostly by the beautiful art design. The use of colored lighting really adds a great touch, and the environments are unbelievably vibrant. There's a lot to 'feel' here just by looking at skyboxes. It's indicative of good art design and adequate design on the technical side to support it. The art team is the MVP here.The sound! Where to start? Jack Wall is absolutely fantastic, almost up to the level he was in the first game. He's at his best when he's laying down eerie music for the tense missions (Collector Ship, anybody?), but he does a great job with handling the huge change in tone from the first game. Mass Effect 1 was carried by a super-techno, futuristic style soundtrack, whereas this one has touches of futurism but mostly just feels brooding and dirty. It fits the art direction of the game perfectly, and even a minimalist track like the droning that plays during the loading screen really does a fantastic job to impart and augment the overall 'feel' of this game, which is a big part of what I find so enticing about Mass Effect 2.The writing is probably the games single strongest aspect. I don't mean to exaggerate, or to gush too much here, but there are some of the most well-written characters in any video game I've ever played. It's clear that Walters, Karpyshyn, and the rest of the writing staff were going for a Dirty Dozen, Wild West type feel with the characters and settings here, and they've succeeded in spades. There are a lot of characters that might even fit into a cliche, but the dialogue is so well-written and the voice acting is so superb that the game manages to skip that pothole and cruise along. Thane Krios, the spiritual, regretful assassin, is a stand-out among a cast of solid personalities. His discussions with Shepard and his dealings with his son Kolyat are excellent. Garrus is far more fleshed out here than he was in the first game (in which I found his character to be disappointingly underdeveloped), and the writing here creates a bridge to his being so likable in the third game. Legion, a character who arrives unfortunately late in the game, is another stellar twist and an amazingly well-written and impresses in unexpected ways. It's hard to go into detail without spoiling anything, but suffice it to say that his obsessive 'complex' is wholly unexpected and goes on to completely destroy any expectation I had when I initially learned of the characters presence in the game.There are some pitfalls here, unfortunately, mostly in the form of Jacob Taylor. He always came off as completely unlikable to me, though that's more a personal feeling and not a general criticism. I think he's a poor character simply because there's not really much there to dig into. He's got some father issues to deal with that feel crammed in mid-game and seem to hover around the outside of his character rather than fleshing out his core, like so many of the other characters side missions are intended to do.Now that I've gushed over the good things, let's talk about some of the bad.The game plays as if its half finished, particularly during combat. There's a nice idea and an adequate core design here, but it seems like it could have used far longer in the QA process than it actually had. The core mechanics of taking down the enemies shields/barriers, armor, and then health are really excellent. Each is weak to a different type of weapon, ammo, and power, so each encounter becomes a sort of puzzle where you're evaluating which enemy is the most threatening and thus must be dealt with first, and by using which power or weapon to do so. It's incredibly complex but relatively simple to learn, and getting through some of the more difficult encounters on hardcore or insanity difficulty is amazingly satisfying.Sounds great, right? Unfortunately, while the game is at its best on the two hardest difficulty modes, it also suffers the most on those modes due to extremely buggy cover mechanics and unbelievably poor friendly AI. The AI is absolutely abysmal, and if you want that Insanity trophy you better be ready for some frustration. It's necessary to completely micomanage your allies by controlling where they're taking cover at all times. The problem with cover also manifests itself here, as there are many times when allies simply refuse to listen to you and wade out into enemy fire only to die immediately. It's so frustratingly idiotic that I find myself wondering how the game ever shipped in this fashion. It's a mess, and having to babysit your idiotic, suicidal squadmates really destroys what would have been an otherwise fantastic gameplay system. The general design is there, but the technical execution is utterly terrible and enough to make you bash your head against a wall. It's much more passable on Normal and Casual, but if you're gunning for Hardcore or Insanity, get ready for a headache.The overall design of the game, despite these poorer aspects, is excellent. The episodic style of gameplay in which you're recruiting allies just feels right, and the game feels far more organized and direct than the first game ever did. On the harder difficulties you really get a sense of it being a race against time. You've got to plan out what missions you're doing at what time, because upgrades are incredibly important and if you find yourself trying to take on Horizon or the Collector Ship without the good ones, you can actually get completely stuck and be forced to start over. While this sounds frustrating, it actually does a good job to suck you into the situation that Shepard and the crew find themselves in. They've got to get all of this done, and quickly, because the Collectors are on the move and they aren't waiting for you. This episodic style is paced perfectly, and you never seem to experience any of the drag that you see in the first game when you get dropped onto the Citadel after Eden Prime only to find yourself immediately bogged down with a huge area to explore and dozens of sidequests to tackle. It does a far better job with making sure you never feel overwhelmed than the first game. It's open-ended enough without stranding you in a sea of objectives -- You've always got a handful of options of what to do next, and it's up to you to decide which seems to be most important.All of the gameplay here comes to a head in a fantastic final act that sees everything you've done so far in the game build up to one massive conclusion. The suicide mission is truly excellent, and caps off a must-play game for everyone interested in RPGs.Insanity gameplay video:

												Mass Effect 2 is a cinematic, story driven game with superb character development, sound and fun gameplay, and an explorative galaxy to boot. As Commander Shepard, you can create your own character, modify how they look, choose their class of biotics and combat tactics, as well as shape your own personal view on the galaxy, either being a kind and forgiving Paragon, or a guns blazing no bull Renegade. As previously mentioned, the characters (which there are plenty of, more if you count DLC from the Deluxe Edition) and they all have great story arcs. The voice acting is superb by both Shepards, male and female. It has expansive codex's to inform those if you havn't played the first game, which you should definitely do as the saves carry over between the games. This is a 10/10 for me, and easily one of my favourite games of all time.			",117,8,1,18,10,2,6

												Mass Effect 2  is Role Play Third Person Shooter. It does stray from the original title on the game play but it is some great improvements on play style and some horrible one just take it all with a grain of salt.  Now the real challenge to this one is o wait don't want to ruin the ending.  But if you played the first you should get his one as well if your looking at this one and not the first you won't miss much but  you won't get the full mass effect of the game (stupid pun).  Be the righteous hero or be the renegade the choice is yours.  I do recommend the bundle for the two.  If you see it on sale it is unquestionably worth it.			",57,2,8,14,5,0,19

												The Mass Effect series has probably been the most rich and emotional trilogy of games I've played since I've started my 'gaming career'. While the current RPG market is oversaturated with boring, shoot 'em ups, and your choices have little to no effect in the games currently on the market. Yes, Mass Effect's main game is a shooter, but Bioware makes up for those rough edges with a fantastic narrative, amazing soundtracks, characters who feel real, and choices that feel satisfactory while having big impacts on your next campaign in Mass Effect. Simply put; this trilogy is a masterpiece.As the iconic Commander Shepard, will you save the galaxy and all of its inhabitants, or doom them to extinction?10/10. ",142,4,0,11,12,0,18

												Mass Effect 2 sees you, yet again fighting to save the galaxy from the mysterious, alluring Reapers.Human colonies are disappearing and you are sent by the shady Illusive Man (Martin Sheen), the leader of the Pro-Human organization,  Cerberus  to find out what is going on, on the way you'll rediscover the new Normandy SR2, rebuilt by Cerberus after the devestating attack in the prologue. On your epic journey across the galaxy you'll meet powerfull allies, old friends, and dark enemies, on your mission to stop the Collectors and thwart the Reaper's plans.Mass Effect's story is one of sheer brilliance, the characters, location, soundtrack and intricately detailed codex will leave you enchanted for weeks. With moral choices that can leave you either stricken with guilt or brimming with a feeling of goodness, you can be sure that Commander Shephard is at the forefront of the fight. With detailed locations and quests you can be sure of a long, rich, gameplay experience that you may find yourself playing after your first playthrough.Mass Effect 2 once again employs the Renegade and Paragon speech options, this means that you can either pick the good option, or bad option when in conversation with a character, this can then, later on affect the choices you can make and the reaction of different characters upon meeting you.In the end, I can not possibly try and sum up Mass Effect 2's brilliance, it is my favourite game of all time, and is a story telling epic, it can and will more than likely leave you in awe and will want you cming back for me, with thoughts of ""Just one more hour"" becoming frequent. There is nothing more for me to say really than buy the game, I urge you, you won't regret it, and for the next 2 days is 75% off!EDIT: In case you're wondering why my play time is so low it's because I own Mass Effect 2 on the Xbox 360, and have played through it around 4 times :D(Mass Effect 2 is a Sci-Fi RPG)			",209,15,4,20,33,3,30

												Mass Effect 2 is the greatest game of our time. Never before in the history of gaming has an individual had so many different choices as to what kinds of extraterrestrial to have sexual relations with. Although the romance stories are quite engaging and emotional, and the cut scences leading up to the implied intercourse quite titilating, I am always left scratching my head. It is not explained thuroughly enough how said conjugations works. How do the parts fit together? Can  commander Shepherd become pregnant? Why are the aliens so attracted to women while I am not? These are questions that are left unanswered. My first love was a krogan, and he will always be closest to my heart. But inspite of my intimacy with Grunt, I was ultimately confused by the biology involved. I understand that krogans posses four gonads but what isn't explained is how large or what shape their members are. One thing I know for sure is that the krogon would likely be on bottom as their sheer mass may very well crush the human involved. The previously mentioned questions perplexed me so much that I wrote my term paper in Human Sexuality class on them. Inspite of it being excelently written I recieved very sharp criticism from both my peers and my mom, who's help I enlisted in editing my paper. Innovators will always be persecuted and misunderstood by the thralls of the ignorant. Love is free. The rules of biology should not limit one's sexual desires. Just as the Supreme Court ruled for marriage equality, one day I would hope they will grant rights to those of us who wish to share physical intamacy with those of another species from another planet. Until then I will fight on with pride in my heart, knowing that being a xenosexual is not a sin, nor a lifestyle. And knowing that is more important than knowing how a krogan's parts fit with a human's parts, and in that lies the true value and lesson in Mass Effect 2.			",64,2,0,7,4,0,19

												Mass Effect is one of the most immense, well written and interesting story based game sagas I've ever played. If you haven't played the first one, you're missing a LOT, especially since all of the choices you've made in the first game can be ported over to the second game to change the experience. The combat's more crisp and cover based, and with cover based combat, my old enemy, ""regenerating health"" came with it, but it's varied nicely through six different player classes you get to select, ranging from abilities in tech, biotics, or good old fashioned, ""Shoot it even harder."" On a better note, the tedious inventory management is gone, as well as that stupid Mako vehicle. The story and atmosphere feels darker and more compelling, but will feel a tad slower in this one compared to the first, because much of the game is spent preparing you and your very likeable crew's survival odds for a final mission laid out early on. If you're a story nut, this series is where it's at!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Amazingly good game following the story of Commander Shepard.Play this game if you want to know cool Characters, a good story and universe and a decently good third person shooter. This game is about the choices you make.You can buy DLC from the Bioware store, but I would say its worth it. At least the DLC for the additional story. The weapons not so much.(Those who wants the full experience)Play all 3 games.The choices you pick in the first game affects the second and so on. So get ME1 play through it with YOUR Shepard, then   import your Shepard from the first to the second and play it and so on. All the story DLC for the games are recommended.  ",208,27,3,38,16,2,32

rating: worth buying at full pricescore: 10/10 - masterpiecesimilar games: Deus Ex, The Bureau, Dragon Age: Origins, Spec Ops The Linetags: story-rich, action packed, epic, character development, choicesMass Effect 1 was an okay game, it had dull gameplay but a good story and cool characters. Mass Effect 2 does not simply improve everything ME1 did, the devs completely overhauled the whole thing like they build it from scratch, this time with much more budget and a longer deadline. Whats impressive about this is the size of the game and the quality of everything. It is very rare that a big game like this, an open world game or RPG, is so well designed in every area. If you think about it there is always something which is not really fleshed out in some game you think are great, of course they are just small things, but that is the difference between a masterpiece and a very good game. For example look at the trading system and shops in most RPGs. Probably the shops will sell random equipment and you can sell everything you find there, and you probably will get tons of loot you never need.In Mass Effect 2 you get no loot, except money and resources. There are only some moments in the game where you find an upgrade or an alternative to an existing weapon. Giving the player tons of loot like in other games (also in Mass Effect 1) just doesnt make sense, because it does nothing except wasting your time because you have to compare it to your existing loot to see if its worth it, if not you will sell it. That also breaks the balance of money the players gets in most games and to counter that the developers balance the shops in a way that you rarely find something useful to buy. Because the money you get in ME2 is more controlled and shops have only specific items they sell only once (you only need them once), everything gets better. Exploration and hacking is more rewarding, because the money you get is more useful. Visiting shops is worth doing because EVERYTHING you can buy is worth it, you just need the money for it. And it opens more flexibility for the devs to design their missions, or just small things like giving you opportunities to get discounts which wouldnt be worth getting in other games. All that is just a tiny fraction of the game, I just want to explain to you to how fleshed out and well designed this game is.Bioware didn't care about genre conventions or did things only because this game is supposed to be an RPG, every decision they made is because it makes sense for the game, nothing else. Another example for that is the inventory system, you have no inventory actually. You only need to find one copy of a weapon, it will be available for all squad members. That removes the really annoying fiddling around with the inventory crap in ME1. They also moved the ammo upgrades from the inventory to the skill menu, which means they are skills now and every crew member has maybe 1 or 2 ammo upgrade available to him, which also gives you more criteria to pick your party-members. There are also other criteria to pick party-members apart from who is the coolest, which was really the only criteria in ME1, skills of your crew didn't really matter. Every party member has set weapon-types he can use, set abilties and strengths which can synergy with others or be redundant.Also there is a mission every crew member will have for you. Doing these will not only make them loyal, they will also unlock an extra ability for them and also matter for the story (no spoilers), but its not just ""doing"" these missions, you can fail them and then they are gone and you have to live with the consequences.In Mass Effect 2 you get your crew members much faster than in ME1, which is good, because it gives you more variety early on and there are more crew members in total, all of them very different and interesting in their own way. There was only 1 character which I hated and is cliche in my opinion (Jack). Actually the conversations with the crew members were the most fun part about ME2 for me, the dialogues were really interesting but not just exposition or alibi character development and all of it is optional, which is great for several reasons. There are many things in Mass Effect 2 which are optional, I think if you do only the must-do things, you could finish this game in 5 hours or so. It took me 25 hours and I know that there were easily 5 more hours I could put into it, but I don't recommend doing everything you can, it could get tenacious. Luckily unlike ME1 where every side-quests was obvious filler, every side mission in ME2 is unqiue and meaningful and you get useful rewards for them. They even managed to make the exploration of planets fun. In ME1 you just clicked on every unexplored planet and you got some text. In ME2 you have a scanner and have to scan the surface manually to find resources. That process is not boring because it is presented very nice and it is very rewarding, because the resources you find are crucial to get upgrades, and the upgrades themselves are also crucial. Still you are not forced to do these scans if you don't want to, there are enough upgrades you can buy and find and you also sometimes find resources on missions.The combat got the biggest overhaul, it is actually fun and challenging now. The AI is improved greatly compared to ME1, but your party sometimes still does stupid things, but you can control them much more easy now and still more flexbile just with 1 button for each party member, and managing them is more important now, because of their powers. Shephard also has powers now depending on the class you pick, most of them you already know from ME1 (they are still cool), but there are also some new powers. These are not only useful and necessary, they are also really fun to use thanks to really good sound-design, animations and hit-feedback. Bioware also proves that you can make satisfying gunsounds for sci-fi/laser weapons. Enemies aren't bullet sponges anymore, if you know how to bring their shields down, they react to your shots, fall down, scream because you burn them or if they are mechs they loose an arm or something. Your shots just have more impact now which makes combat more fun overall. The only thing which could be improved is the enemy design, the enemies are cool and there are a good number of enemy types, but the tactics you fight them with are not much different. With more diverse enemy types the combat could have more variety, which it does not really need though. I'm not a fan of regenerating health, because it makes the outcome of a fight irrelevant for the next fights, it only matters that you win the fight, but regenerating health makes sense for this game and works.I don't want to talk much about the story, because I don't want to spoil anything. What really surprised me was the amount of elements which carry over from ME1 and how many choices you have in general, these not only have impacts on small side-stories, but also on the ending of ME2. The ending alone of ME2 is a masterpiece. There are so many variables in the ending it easily surpasses the amount of choices you have in other games, and in most games your choices don't really matter anyway. I'm really eager to see how the consequences will affect ME3. There were parts in the game where I really had to think about my decisions, rarely the choices are black and white, sometimes you might not even notice that something is a ""choice"". Especially one decision kept me thinking for a very long time, and I still don't know what the right thing to do was (probably because there is no simple right and wrong for that question). The story is much more engaging and the dialouges much more interesting than in ME1, because they properly animated the cutscenes this time. Characters don't just stand infront of each other like robots, they move around, do things, even Shephard does. I have no more characters left for this review.			",301,32,3,20,9,0,16

												On one hand, in many respects it is the last good Bioware game. On the other, it is clear a fundamental change in design philosophy occurred during the game's development signaling the beginning of their end.In any case, EA has butchered the game by splitting it up into tiny DLC pieces that you can't even get with regular currency, but ""Bioware Points"", and therefore I cannot recommend the game in this state. Do yourself a favor and get the ""non-Steam version"". And no, I'm not referring to the Origin version.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You have to make an account with Bioware, but luckily I already had one.  Key 1 - accepted.  Key 2 - denied, you must pay bioware money to activate this.  Key 3 - invalid.Oh, and forget about transferring your data from ME1 to ME2 even though it is supported. Not happy...  but i'll just play it and forget about all the DLC I just missed out on, but was promised in the package I bought.  Thanks again steam...Almost forgot, the 'help' link on this page in case you need assistance? Broken link.			",35,6,0,15,6,0,3

												I like Mass Effect 2 because it brings a good story. The team that made this is awesome I would recommend this game plus Mass Effect 1 and Mass Effect 3 which you can get on OriginBesides that Mass Effect 2 is like Mass Effect 1 but what is different is that there is no Mako, I would defently recommend this game and if you think you have to Play Mass Effect 1 first, that is not the case I just knew the story of Mass Effect 1, and I was able to play Mass Effect 2 but either way if you like Sci-fi RPG's Third-Person Shooter's then you should defently play Mass Effect seriesBioware, you guys did an awesome job making the Mass Effect games, and I give you guys credit!

												El mejor Sci-Fi RPG que jugué en mi vida... una excelente historia, muy de película, bastante sombría y dramática.El gameplay es más dinámico que el Mass Effect 1, pudiendo hacer una enfrentación sin tener que pausear para que la squad use sus poderes bióticos, o sin tener que pausear para cambiar el tipo de munición.Los gráficos son más oscuros y nítidos en color, eso le da una linda atmósfera, sintiendo estar en otro juego, sacándote la idea de una expansión del 1.¿Si necesitás haber jugado el primero para entender el segundo?Para nada, aunque algunos personajes vuelven, las decisiones que tomaste (las cuales cambia todo, ya que incluso hay decisiones de vida o muerte, tanto de la squad como propias) se mantienen, aunque si no importás el savegame del primero, las decisiones serían las ""default"".Explorar la Vía Láctea, conocer e interactuar con otras razas, explorar planetas y lunas (incluso nuestra Luna), con una fantástica historia.

												Having just recently replayed Mass Effect 2 I was shocked at just how well everything has held up. People praise ME2 for being one of the greatest games made and it's hard to argue. Mass Effect 2 is a truly remarkable game and what makes it that way isn't any one aspect, but the interplay between all the systems that has allowed it to shine. Only by skillfully weaving the elements of combat, story, art and sound together did the men and women of BioWare create such a remarkable experience. But there's one additional system that has helped elevate Mass Effect 2 to such a timeless classic. The players. By adding our own personal stories to the tapestry already laid out by BioWare did each and everyone of us create their own indelible experiences that will always hold up to the test of time. Mass Effect 2 respects the player's choices and because of that it will ALWAYS be that good.			",109,31,0,31,2,0,5

SummaryHonestly, doing a review for such an already ubiquitous game may well be a pointless exercise, but to be honest I just played this game for 40 hours in 3 days and I wanted a place to put my thoughts. The game isn't perfect, but it's damn good. The few flaws are mostly a consequence of the development being focused towards consoles, but they aren't game destroying.Also I'm writing this withough having read any other reviews - it was a bit of an impulse buy - so apologies if I repeat everything you've already read, or completely miss the point somewhere.Pros:Immersive worldFantastic writingVoice actingShootingCons:Texture quality/general graphics optionsVariety of combatKeybindingsFacial expressions made by ShepardStory (Spoiler free)Frankly, this is the only reason anyone should get this game. If you have no interest in storytelling whatsoever, there are much better shooters out there; if you have no interest in shooters, it's not worth being put off. The story is very immersive, with an incredibly fleshed out world, and more than makes up for any flaws the game has in other areas. Characters don't feel neglected, although sometimes there isn't quite enough content for a character you want to experience more of. (Side note: You may get a mixed first impression of ""The Salarian"", which could prompt you to stop going out of your way to talk to him. This is the sensible option if you wish to preserve your sides later in the game. Some of his lines are just golden.)If you haven't played Mass Effect 1, I would recommend playing it first, even if it is mechanically slightly inferior to it's sequel, and you can play it without. However, a lot of enjoyment can be derived from taking a single Shepard, with all his actions, choices, and in my case, awful facial hair, through the series.CombatSatisfying, though slightly repetitive. The cover system can be awkward to use at times, thanks to Use, Sprint, and Take Cover all forcibly bound to the same action - by far the ugliest scar from the console port. If, like I did, you want to play with the same controls as every other PC shooter in the universe, the easiest fix is to use the primary and secondary keybinding functionality to bind the do-everything button to both what you want the Use and Sprint buttons to be. Often you'll be sprinting into cover anyway, so it kind of works, but it's definitely not ideal.There's a lot of variety to be had in terms of the ways you can build Shepard, but during a single playthrough it can get fairly restrictive, especially if you want to play optimally. That said, the variety in squadmates can allow a few different tactical approaches for the same Shepard, even if you only get to experience their skills and playstyle via the tactics interface, which carries over nicely from Mass Effect 1.Roleplaying and MoralityThe morality system is extremely black and white, which can be an issue, but if you stick to any non-gamey moral compass for your Shepard, it will probably see you pick up a good few Paragon and Renegade points each. Some important dialogue options require many of one or the other, though, so it's difficult to play a middle man, which is a little disappointing. Additionally, some choices don't really fall under stereotypical ""good"" and ""evil"" labels either way, but they assign Parargon and Renegade points to them anyway, so it doesn't always make sense. I didn't find it really hindered me in any way though. The feeling of decisions having an impact in the world is always great, though.			",57,10,3,10,7,0,13

												If you haven't played Mass Effect 1 then stop reading this review AND GO PLAY THAT FIRST to have the best experience! Mass Effect 2 takes many of the rpg elements from Mass Effect 1 out but solidifies the gameplay more and trims out all the fat from the first game so you get nothing but pure meat.The exploration is gone but in return you get better dialouge and better combat. The characters are more diversed and flushed out and I thought they were better due to personalities and more backstory into them, If you are into sidequests over main missions then ME2 does a way better job than ME1 in that respect and the main quest is still really good but the side missions mostly involve loyalty missions to give your crew members more story and helping them out. Would I reccommend ME2 over ME1? No because I believe that you have to play all 3 games to get the full experience but IMO the gameplay is a lot better than ME1 but less tactical and more action. It still feels like a choose your own adventure game and has that 70's, 80's Space opera feel that the first one has but adds more spices to it like Omega which is heavily inspired by the film Blade Runner. It's well worth a buy and you will love every minute of it. Suicide mission is also one of the best end missions I have ever played, I felt really engrossed and felt like I was in a daredevil mission with the odds stacked against me. It's hard for me to choose between which I like more in Mass Effect 1 or 2 because they are both awesome but this game is worth a playthrough and It is one of the best sequels ever.

												This is a fantastic game. The gameplay is fun, and has a clean layout bar for all your biotics. There is alot of fun to be had. The story took me around 25 hours to complete, and it was epic from start to finish. The pacing of it is also really good. The share of time with the story and gameplay are near perfect, and Bioware definetly knew their strong points in the developement. The RPG factor of this game is also really well made, with dialogue options that progress into relationships and story, and an interesting karma system similar to SWTOR and Fallout: New Vegas that unlock more dialogue options. The graphics are pretty good too, but I'm not gonna go into detail about that since this is a 5 year old game. The sound design helps set the theme for a futuristic galaxy very well, and there are a few songs from the official soundtrack that I really like. Now... technical issues. The game crashed on me twice. I don't know why, but they did. Also one time, I was floating in the air walking around, which was hilarious until I found out couldn't get down. Luckily I could just load the previous autosave. Seriously though, this is still a fantastic game. There's a HUGE galaxy to explore, and a ton of planets to visit or even mine resources from. Even when you finish the storyline and feel those chills from that EPIC ending mission, you can still continue travelling around the Milky Way completing sidequests. Not only is Mass Effect 2 a fantastic game, but it is now one of the best games I have ever played.			",103,18,2,16,1,2,7

												Awarded ""Game of the Year 2010"" on my blog, Choicest Games. Mass Effect 2 takes almost everything that was good from its predecessor and improves upon it. Although there are some tedious parts, the great soundtrack, professional voice acting, improved graphics, streamlined gameplay and multiple paths available makes this one sci-fi RPG you don't want to miss.

												Finished the game with insanity difficulty yesterday (and started with it ^^) and now I'm going to the new game+ in casual, damnly hilarious!This game has pretty much everything for itself, the gameplay's wonderful, the graphics are very good, it has boobs (and sex somehow) and guns, there are aliens. The syfy part is really intersteting and every planet has its description. You have many many choices during the game which, for most of them, does truly matter for the rest of the game. There are many possible classes, though as I just ended the game with one of them I can't really talk about it. Though, I suspect it is a good point. And way, much more... ^^ (such as hacking, bypassing... Reminded me of Alien Isolation, loved it) The bad points will take me more times, but it's because I don't want to spoil any of the game. I insist this is a wonderful game, I rarely end my games and I'm about to do it a second time. It's just that I found intersting to explain what can be bad, for two reason. First, because it's important for you to know if there are thing you can't live with (but I doubt it'll be the case here), and second because other people will be able to contrast my opinion. ^^There are some bad points too. Glitches, damn I was almost at the 400th save cause even when no battle was excpected, I feared to start flying or to get stuck in wall or similar weird behaviors. These does not happen often, but as there sometimes are no way to get rid of them if not reloading a previous game, it can be really really annoying. (It has never been for me as the first time it happened to me I started saving as I was breathing, but no doubt it can be) Another glitch which is quiet weird but is not a problem at all is that sometimes characters don't have their proper voices (and no, I'm not talking about mike going weird, there's that too I know it's normal), this isn't exactly a bad point as it's even funny sometimes.Another bad point is the money. You're limited in money by the money you get from your missions and this isn't enough to buy everything, I think it's possible through new game+ though, I'll see that soon enough. Quiet the same, but some people will probably prefer it this way, it's not possible to level paragon and renegate to the max. It's though probably to have one to the max if you foccus, but you can't try to have always all choices, or if it's possible, I clearly missed something. (If that's the case, please tell me that, without telling me what this is, wanna find out by myself)And there is that keybinding that made me mad more than once. the SPACEBAR which became LEFTSHIFT to me is used to, well, everything. Interaction, picking up, talking, hiding, crouching, running. This is conveniant, but also very annoying. You're just trying to running from those enemy of yours, you just slip for a bit on the left and there you're now hiding in plain side which is a suicide move. And there lots of other ugly situation this is causing. Another thing, and if you've never play the game it's important you hear that, the tip at the beginning of the game ain't dynamic. So if you change you're keybinding's settings these will still point you to the default settings, so be sure to remember really well after changing you biding that you'll be able to know how to use them.And one hell of a bad point... You can't have a lesbian relationship between Shepard and Miranda. (damn! xD)Oh another bad point I'm starting to experience, I yes I know manipulating the file it is possible, but you cannot skip the long, long introduction of the game. And when you wanna restart it, this is becoming a real pain in the <3. ^^I'd like to add that I didn't play Mass Effect 1  (yet :p), and this isn't really annoying, the game kinda ""remind"" you of what happened in the first game, though I think it'd be better, but that doesn't have to stop you.About difficulty, this isn't a realy hard game. As I said, I started the game with the insanity difficulty with no previous experience in the mass effect franchise and I managed to keep it isane 'till the end of the game. Not that insanity is not hard (it is ^^), but the game is quiet intuitive, it's easy to find how to handle a battle and if you're not to bad at aiming, this isn't that hard. I can't advise any difficulty as I only know insanity (and a bit of casual now).I'm disappointed there's only a ""yes/no"" notation on steam, I'd like to put a ten to this game! :D			",256,44,2,28,19,2,29

												After finishing Mass Effect 1 a couple of days ago, I was eager to start playing Mass Effect 2 as soon as possible. Expecting more of the same, I was in for a few unpleasant surprises. So much has changed that it almost feels like a different game. CONTROLS:The controls are so radically different from ME1 that it actually got me killed on several occasions. I felt like my arms had been cut off and then sewn back on backwards! I know that eventually I'll get used to the new controls but they still feel super weird.WEAPONS:Reloading? Seriously? Can't buy new weapons, only the blueprints? Really? While I'm happy that I don't have to manually customize every single weapon on every single squad member, this is a bit too simplistic.MAP:There was nothing wrong with the maps in ME1. The map in ME2 is hard to read and too colourful. It looks like somebody just resized all the locations to 20x10 pixels and made them into a map. What happened to the ability to add waypoints?HUD:Why am I able to ""light up"" objects through walls? It's distracting. The colour and thickness of the rectangle make things easy to miss. In the first ME game everything stood out great when you placed the crosshairs over an item.CHARACTER SKILLS:What happened to all my skills from ME1? Puff! Disappeared into thin air! Now you only get five. Yay! Thank you, Bioware!PROFANITY:I don't remember hearing much profanity in ME1. While I'm not against it per se, I didn't expect this from ME2 judging by the tone set by ME1. Completely unnecessary.Overall I can't say it's a bad game and I'm curious to see how the story develops. However, compared to ME1, I can't help but wonder: WHAT WERE THEY THINKING!!?

												A must-have sequel to original Mass Effect. Not that it is particularly great - in my opinion, it doesn't measure up to its predecessor nor to the trilogy's finale - but it's a necessary part of the story and it's definitely worth playing.The second part of ME franchise puts greater accent on squad interaction. In fact, you can get as much as a dozen companions, and missions related to their backstories occupy most of the game. It might be a turn-off for some, but if you felt immersed in the first Mass Effect, you should find most of those characters and missions quite enjoyable, at least during the first playthrough. I promise you're going to love some of your new squadmates, who will make you laugh and cry, and it seems that your old friends haven't forgotten about you after all.The main storyline is consequently even shorter than in ME1, though with all the other assignments it shouldn't be a problem. One's for sure - I'm not going to spoil the climax, but it's as epic as the battle with the Sovereign. Mass Effect series didn't lose its scale and there are still moments that make you turn up the volume and sit at the edge of your seat. The ground battles have a whole new quality to them (finally Mass Effect has elements of a proper shooter - ducking behind cover and shooting seems more real and exciting than in the first part of the series), though perhaps you're going to miss the Mako.A few words about the equipment system - it's much simplier than in the first game and I personally consider it an improvement. If you enjoyed comparing stats, shopping, and painstakingly equipping every single member of your squad, you might be disappointed, but if not, here's good news. The whole equipment system has been replaced with several items of weaponry, a few customizable elements of armor for Shepard, and a variety of upgrades giving bonuses for Commander or the whole squad. You may like it or not, but it's definitely easier to deal with. Leveling system has been simplified as well - maybe even too much - but it's now more intuitive, and it doesn't take 40 levels to get you the skill you want anymore.My biggest pain with this game lies within DLC-s, which cost more than the game itself (especially when it's on sale), but when you finally play them, they seem essential to the story. It might be a pain in your wallet, but the sad truth is that some content has been apparently cut from the game and sold in separate bundles. Mass Effect 2 is still a fairly good game by itself, but it feels somehow incomplete without that additional content.That said, it's still Mass Effect, and thus it's a part of one of the greatest stories I've been immersed in. Don't forget to check digital deluxe edition available here for the same price... and have fun!			",6,1,0,7,1,0,0

												Never in my life have I been as immersed in such a solid and breath-taking gaming experience. Mass Effect truly brings something new to the table. From dialogue with character, to romancing Miranda ( omg <3 <3 ), to the cyberpunk dirty streets and the wild club of Omega, the beauty of the Citadel and planets, I felt like I was there and I was immersed the whole way.12/10: A must play.

												Hands down one of the best RPG's ever made on par with the original KOTOR, go figure be it from Bioware. They took all the clinical beauty of Mass Effect 1 and modernized it into a more fast paced and dumbed down approach which works out very well. The story, characters, and graphics are amazing, and replayability is definately there.			",139,6,1,18,10,0,18

												Although I'm late to the party, the whole ME trilogy kept me glued to my screen, challenged me and made me go through an emotional rollercoaster. It catapulted itself from ""a game I've heard of"" to ""top favorite/best game I've played so far"".It's the only game that made me want to restart from scratch the minute I've finished it.I give it a 100/10.

												With Mass Effect Andromeda on the near horizon, I wanted to go back and replay the original trilogy.Mass Effect 1 was a truly fantastic game and so I eagerly looked forward to the next installment in the series.The talented folks at BioWare did not disappoint. ME2 has a great compelling story complete with rich  characters and the right amount of action.I thoroughly enjoyed the adventure, but as P.T, Barnum/Walt Disney once said, “Always leave them wanting more.”And I want more.Is it wrong of me to want more? Has BioWare spoiled me so much that when they offer me a grand feast I find fault with the tablecloth? Shame on me, I know, but I make these observations out of love – like a doting parent over their gifted child. “That was GREAT BioWare, but deep down, I know you can do better!”The graphics are stunning and beautifully done. I marveled at just how immersive they were.It was very cool that you could (relatively) easily import your original Commander Shepherd from ME1 into ME2 along with all the choices that you made in ME1. The fact that those choices MATTERED and came back to impact ME2 – that was very satisfying.The game was rock solid. Not once did it crash on my computer. I did experience two small bugs during the main game. At one point I was unable to back-out of scanning a planet for valuable resources and had to drop out of the game to restart. Later in the game, my Commander Shepherd character sat down INSIDE a desk and looked up, over his shoulder at the other character speaking.Later during the Firewalker expansion, the game froze for approximately ten seconds, but then resumed. Also my re-mapping of the controls had an adverse impact on controlling the hovertank – drilling for research. I had to set them back to default in order to continue the mission.All in all, these were very minor complaints. The backdrops were gorgeous and many times I had to stop and look around just to take it in. The combat was good, with the right mix of intelligence and furious firing. The Heavy Weapons are a welcome addition.  I thought the AI was very well done. The enemy took cover and tied to get behind your cover to fire at you. Also your companions intelligently sought and used cover very well. As a whole, I thought the use and ease of cover was excellent! Very seamless and extremely useful!There were a few puzzle-solving missions where you never fired a shot – I enjoyed the variety. It felt good to mix things up.The “heat sinks” for the weapons were a step backwards in my humble opinion. I felt like we went from a truly futuristic idea of not needing a ton of ammunition to reload the weapons, to having to constantly look and find these generic heat-sinks. Why not just say we needed regular ole ammo again?I also missed being able to customize my weapons with different types of ammo and weapon mods. Yes, it was neat that there were seven steps to progressively upgrade the weapons, but it did not quite come across the same to me. In ME1, you could have customized weapons and ammo load-out for different members of your squad. Now, you had to rely on a class skill upgrade giving you access to a type of ammo. It didn’t make much sense and it didn’t feel as customizable. I will admit that the upside was the ease in which could direct characters to change specialized ammos in ME2.However, I loved the ability to modify your armor and customize the colors – that was very cool!I thought that the game could have benefited from more variety in the lock-picking/hacking mini-games. Why couldn’t we bring back some of the old classics from ME1? I did appreciate being able to buy mods which allowed me more time to solve them – that was nice!I really liked being able to purchase special ingredents to improve the quality of the food and give crew morale a boost. I thought that being able to upgrade the Normandy was a great new concept. Having those additional enhancements ultimately helped you to succeed and emerge victorious in the final conflict. However, I was hoping for more ability to add things that would be a bit more useful during the early and mid-game. Perhaps like a firing range, where you could improve your team’s combat skills over time or perhaps allow them to be able to learn different weapons throughout the game. Maybe you had the alternate choice of adding a biotics lab.  Maybe a running track or fitness room which allowed characters to train and gain more hit points. How about adding an arcade or bowling alley to improve crew morale? Shepherd himself comments about adding a bar in the observation lounge – a nice nod to Star Trek TNG. I kept wanting to do more to keep the crew happy and efficient. One trip to the provisioner in the Citadel wasn’t enough for the good Commander Shepherd in my mind. The little devils at BioWare might make these things expensive for us, or add quests for materials or missions for those who would make the modifications all the while forcing you to make tough choices because there wouldn’t be enough room on the Normandy for all the things that you want.The ability to find/buy things to customize your captain’s cabin was great! I just wanted more and more! Perhaps a robot that would feed my fish for me.The story and the dialog were excellent! I wish there had been a little more dialogue and interaction between the other characters, which is what BioWare is so famous for. I thought there was too little of that.It also seemed to me that the designers listened to the player feedback about the pacing of ME1 and made modifications. In ME1, I felt pressured to rush through the main story line to save the galaxy. In ME2, the pacing has been modified so that I could explore, gain the loyalty of my crew and undertake the side missions without feeling that I was failing the main story.I appreciate a company that doesn’t shrink from making a game for adults. The content, the decisions, the relationships, the colorful language – it all helps to build a terrific and immersive world that you don’t want to leave. Maybe I can’t travel the stars and save humanity, but BioWare allows me believe that I can – and that’s just as good.The final battle was a tad disappointing in my humble opinion.[SPOILER ALERT]A giant terminator robot – really? That’s the best boss-creature we could come up with? I was a little confused – I didn’t think the thing had legs yet, and yet it was able to stand up 80 feet on its metal spine, fight me and my squad on a floating platform and duck and weave like a professional boxer?[/spoiler alert]Ah well, I still loved the game. I put in between 40 and 50 hours playing it the first time and I haven’t finished the Firewalker missions yet.I don’t know whom to credit the recent trend of unlocking “achievements” in a game, but I like it! It’s like an addicting hobby collecting pins. I am motivated to unlock things and earn “badges” of honor. It inspires me to go back and try and get the ones that I did not complete on my first go through.In conclusion, I thought that ME2 was a terrific game; A worthy successor to the excellent galaxy-building work done by BioWare. I can’t wait for Mass Effect 3, and 4 and beyond! It is a terrific franchise and I hope that it continues to improve! ",38,21,1,39,25,1,48

												don't expect a outstanding shooter/rpg, this game is carried solely by its characters.most of the levels outside of towns are designed like tubes or arenas with the occasional branch which always lead back together at some point, exploring for hidden items is limited. the fighting/shooting is nothing to write home about. the majority of skills you can unlock aren't to exciting either.biggest con are probEably the mini games most of them are fun for the first few times BUT they are HOPELESSLY overused, especialy mining/probing for minerals becomes a very annoying chore after the first couple of planets, expect to spend atleast half of your total game time just harvesting planets if you are the hoarding type of player.once you reach the end of the game you realise you only needed a small fraction of all the minerals that you can mine to unlock all upgrades, perfect example for a artifical game-time extender.the main story is ok but the thing that kept me playing till the end are the dialogues, facial expressions and overall very good design of every character, creature and even most of the enviorments and their individual storys that make this game-univers so believable and intersting.

												Let me keep it simple and out of all these reviews thankyou for reading mine. Mass Effect is simply a phenomenally designed and well written for ultimate entertainment. This game for the RPG, third- person shooter, Sci-Fi, and story rich. The game is rather linear as it is all about the story, but you do make many decisions that affect the gameplay. The story is rich and deep, while the gameplay is epic and immersive. You utilize a team of aliens from all over the galaxy to help on a dangerous mission to save the human and alien races from the looming dangers of the Reaper alien threat!!!! One of the best games in the galaxy. 10/10 Would punch another Krogan in the face to earn their respect.			",29,1,0,2,1,0,2

												I have played and beaten this game over 11 times, the first 10 times were back when I used to game on console (those days are long gone) So I thought since I loved this game so much, may as well buy it again on steam for a cheap price, I personally think that this is the best mass effect in the series, it's also one of my most favorite games of all time.I should note that the combat is much better than in the first mass effect, but a lot of people felt that the story suffered as well in the second game, which I understand since it focused more on characters than the story itself. I would recommend you get this over the first mass effect if you absolutely cannot afford both, the first mass effect didn't age very well....			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best RPGs. Offers a lot of dialogue and different outcomes to more than just the ending. The game makes sure to reward the player for their efforts, and there is a lot to do. What stops this game from being legendary is the developers not taking enough time to perfect everything, but considering that this is just one of many Mass Effect games I can understand if this is to be seen as just one piece of the story. I have not played any of other ones yet, but I probably will!The things that amazed me: The unique design of all the main areas (there is even good music!) The talented team that reflects through all of the characters in this game - their personalities as well as their appearances The lore in this game, it's massive, almost overwhelming if you haven't played Mass Effect (1), but thats a good thing! The dialogue.The things I personally appreciated: The great introduction to the game, and friendliness towards players who haven't experienced the first game. It's ability to get me hooked. Dying to get to the next dialogue, mission or whatever. The difficulty, and the ability to prepare in many ways and even make it harder for a better reward/outcome The complexity, the emotions, the many endings.Things that I experienced and found negative: How the game gets easier with time How some decisions have a tremendous impact while others (that you think would matter) don't really matter The unexciting ending which dissapointed How there are patterns that when you notice them the game becomes predictable9/10 ",35,2,0,4,1,1,1

												Played 20+ hours of this in a single weekend, I literally could not put it down. The possibility of creating your own character and dictate it's decisions and personality provides for one of the most immersive gaming experiences you'll ever have. This is what games should always be, an interactive media where, instead of just inputting action, you're writing your own path and telling your own story, molding the framework the developers created into your liking. This is what a true interactive media should be like.Mass Effect 2 is a masterpiece, filled with the most interesting characters and settings I've ever seen in a video game, stellar gameplay, amazing storytelling and music and the most rewarding - and thrilling - choice mechanic. I cannot praise it enough. A true masterpiece that shows what video games are capable of as a true artform, building upon cinematic language and adding interactivity and the instrument of choice to become the ultimate storytelling medium.To sum it up, don't waste an opportunity to experience Mass Effect 2 at least once in your life. (P.S.: I recommend this specially to Star Trek fans, trust me on that one)			",205,51,3,19,13,0,8

												The direct sequel to the blockbusting science fiction RPG hit by Bioware, Mass Effect 2 picks up on and improves everything that made ME1 so memorable.Just like the first game, Mass Effect 2 has a very high immersion factor thanks to givin the player every opportunity to step into the shoes of the now legendary Commander Shepard, a completely customizeable protagonist in whom the player can all but become the savior or the scourge of the galaxy. Thanks to the save-file transfer system, all the major and even a few minor choices the player made in the first game will carry over into this game and change how the galactic community views you and the human race. The story has evolved quite a bit and at this point in the series is beginning to unfold into something grand and sinister, upon learning that your quarry from the previous game was nothing more than a mindless puppet being used by an even greater threat, the Commander has had difficulty convincing the council of this looming presence (ah yes, ""reapers"") and is instead being sent out to clean out the remaining synthetic soldiers used by Saren. Until a massive twist in the form of what looks suspiciously like a floating space turd attacks your ship and kills you in the process, but fear not, because you are revived at no small cost by Cerberus, an extremist pro-human organization that is officially labelled as a terrorist group. They explain that the space turd that killed you is related to a systematic series of abductions of human colonies, they believe something greater is at work and that you are the only one who can do anything about it.The combat mechanics have improved tenfold since the previous game, the cover system is much more fluid and dynamic and gunfights are intense, fast paced and mind boggling. The gameplay factor has also been completely amped up by the removal of the Mako and the horrendous inventory management system that plagued the first game, simplifying the inventory system and adding resources to collect via exploring the galaxy that can be used to research upgrades for your ship, armor, weapons and abilities. Like the previous game, the dialogue is highly varied, offers different outcomes based on your behavior and adds a good replay factor to the game. Being respectful or a complete jerk adds to a ""paragon and renegade"" score that can unlock further dialogue options that can make certain missions go a lot smoother, as well as adding a paragon-renegade interrupt indicator during conversations which can make the commander perform a heroic deed or a reckless decision. The choice, and consequences, are completely up to you. The squad has increased dramatically, with DLCs maxing out at 12 squadmates to choose from on missions. Each squadmate also offers their own personal mission which when completed earns you that particular squadmate's undying loyalty and unlocks a new ability and outfit for them.However, Mass Effect 2 also has more than it's fair share of graphical bugs that can break the immersion, as well as the occasional game-breaking glitch where the commander floats up to and gets trapped in the ceiling for no expliciable reason, forcing the player to reload their game and avoid the area where it occured. The level design is also far more linear than the previous game, and feels like a bit of a hand holder throughout as a result. All things considered, with a large experience that can easily max out at over 15 hours per playthrough depending on how much you want to experience the game, Mass Effect 2 is a deserving addition to the series and remains one of the best games I've played. Highly recommended.			",143,30,0,14,4,2,3

												Wow.It's hard to overstate how much I enjoyed this game. It is masterful on every level - story, writing, scope, decision making, combat, environmental design, artwork, lighting effects, cinematography, musical score, sound design, and virtually any other area I can think of. It is, without exaggeration, that good.(mini spoiler) And the last mission - any team member you have come to know in the game can die a very permanent death based on your decisions, giving the finale a weight and consequence rarely experienced in video games. (end mini spoiler)What is perhaps most staggering is that even after a 50-hour playthrough (DLC included), you can be sure that you have seen far less than even half of the possibilities that the game has to offer. The original game isn't nearly as perfect, but still worth a run-through for the storyline and decisions that will carry over into the sequel.No, the game is not without faults. For one thing, it's overly easy and overly simplified compared to the original.It doesn't have the same level of cinematic polish that we've come to expect from AAA titles in 2013 and beyond.It gets excessively talkative and stale in certain areas.Much like the previous game, the romance subplots are stupid. If you want your Commander Shepard to get some quick and casual sex, it's not gonna happen. It's deep love or nothing. And that deep love comes out of nowhere, since your intimate conversations with any given love interest are extremely limited.But by far the worst of Mass Effect 2's problems is the very time-consuming process of grinding for resources, which isn't any fun at all. There are nearly endless amounts of resources available, but the game doesn't tell you how many you need. While there are ship upgrades available later in the game to make these processes quicker, the game doesn't tell you about them, and so you may waste much time in the first half grinding before acquiring them. My advice: grind at a minimum until you get the upgrades, and then only focus on ""rich"" planets, since there are more than enough to get you through.(Issues)I want to mention a few minor issues that you might run into. I frequently clipped through objects and got stuck, forcing a reload, and there are a few missions tied to DLC that resulted in game-breaking crashes. The latter problem was easily rectified by creating a shortcut to the .exe and putting -nomoviestartup in the parameters. One last very strange glitch resulted in my player character stretching her arms out to the sides, unable to shoot or interact anymore, solved only by reloading an earlier save and trying different dialogue choices before the bug. With a game this big, my recommendation is to keep numerous save files and save often.Overall, Mass Effect 2 is definitely one of my favorite games of 2010, matched only by Red Dead Redemption. In my book, that's saying a lot.9/10			",300,95,2,22,8,1,9

												One of my favorite games ever. Mass Effect 2 makes massive strides towards fixing the issues with it's predecessor while also creating a fantastic cinematic experience for your average gamer. pros +Great combat especially in comparison to the previous game+Clear how each level will effect your character+Very large pool of squadmates larger than both ME1 and 3.+Loyalty missions help give depth to each character.+Overall fantastic story; however, it is a bit disappointing that some of the original squad members only make minor appearances+One of the greatest soundtracks in history.+Absolutely stunning ending that will leave you excited for the sequel. Cons - A distinct lack of rpg elements. To me ME1 seemed to have some pointless customization and rpg elements that bordered on annoying. While you can tell they tried to address this the game does feel shallow in some of it's out of combat mechanics unlike ME1 or ME3. I do feel like ME3 finds the medium the best.-The number of squad members although nice does somewhat make it hard to share a bond with all of them leading to me not caring about some as much as I had in the previous game.- Although the combat is very improved as long as you are patient as far as when you go out of cover the game can be a breeze because enemies have limited tools to force you out of cover which is added in Mass Effect 3.Overall fantastic game in the series which I know some hail as the best in the series. It was a giant leap on it's predecessor and a fantastic entry to the series; however, it does have some flaws and that is why I do keep it slightly behind ME3 despite the endings shortcomings.It's also hard to recommend this game without the willingness to play the other 2 so I recommend you pick those up as well. Note: Mass Effect 3 is not available on steam and must be purchased through EA Origin. ",135,33,0,47,34,4,23

												A brilliant game, Although they changed the mechanics of playing from the first part it was still hugely enjoyable and kind of ruined my perception of other games. I played Bioshock Infinite after I finished the Mass effect series and was very disappointed with their overall mechanics and storyline whereas the Mass Effect narrative was far more intuative and enjoyable.

												I absolutely loved the first one, especially the ability to totally min/max your armour and weapon stats with the various upgrades. this second installment toned down those rpg elements significantly, but in turn ramped up the storyline and character level tenfold!One of the best sci fi shooter adventures released in the last few years, in my opinion :)			",521,133,15,53,30,1,54

												You won't know the true meaning of cinematic story telling unless you have played this game. The setting, the art style, voice acting and the pace is just: https://i.redd.it/vmaai3h6j8ix.pngThere is an interactive galaxy map where you can fly your ship from planet to planet, or use mass relays and teleport from one point of the galaxy to another. Each planet that you land feels so different and alive. Gameplay is fun, fresh and exciting. They give you 6 classes to choose from that suits all type of gameplay.I was so obsessed with preparing for the sucide mission that I had forgot to romance with anyone in this game. So no comment there.A recap on Mass Effect 1: 


YouTube™ Video: Mass Effect Synopsis/Summary (HD) 

			Views: 18,716		

			This is the Mass Effect ""Story so far.."" from Bioware's Website. It's a quick Mass Effect digest video summarizing what happened leading up to Mass Effect 2.		

Sypnosis of Mass Effect 2: The game starts off with the Normandy being attacked by an unknown ship and Shepard being killed in action. He was later on brought back by Ceberus, lead by the Illusive Man, who assigned him on a mission to investigate why the humans colonies have been disappearing. After discovering that it was the Collectors who are behind these abductions, the same species that are responsible for the destruction of Normandy and Shepard's death, the commander must scout the galaxy and build the best team to take the fight to the Collectors.

												This game is a masterpiece. ME1 was great, but this just builds on it and expands...a lot. If you thought the world was big in the last game, then expect the world to explode. You get to visit a much darker side to the galaxy. The graphics are amazing, a definite step up from the first game. I loved seeing the familiar faces, and liking the new comrades brought in. While you will definitely have your favorites, there is no doubt that Mass Effect 2's characters are distinct and memorable. For those who love romance, there are more love interests available. Trying to save the world is the best time to find the love of your life. The world is beautiful to look at and there is a lot to do aside from the story. There are tons of side quests to do with your companions and trips to planets to find minerals that will decide the loyalty of your comrades to who will survive through the game.  I believe that it is the strongest game in the trilogy. I've enjoyed multiple playthroughs and I know that there will be more to come. This game is just about perfect.			",114,169,0,22,10,3,18

   My Playthrough   Youtube Playlist    The Review Mass Effect 2 is an interesting case. While this game does add a lot of things like more exploitable cities, more companions, and a much bigger ship. They also removed some content as well like exploring uncharted worlds with the M35 Mako, the 60 level cap, a lot of talents, and worse of all the ability to talk to your companions at any time. This game does have some pros like the story is still good and the companions are well written and voice acted. The gamEplay is still the same as the prequel but now their is ammo and weapon restrictions. The cons are mostly all the things that Bioware removed from Mass Effect but a big one is that this game is far more linear than ME1. Now you can recruit any companions that you want and you have to wait for specific points to recruit your favorite companions. From all the negitives that I listed you are probably wondering why I am still recommending this game. Well while this game is not as great as Mass Effect it is still a good game and I recommend playing it.  ",2391,978,75,299,289,29,372

												Taking everything the first title did and exceeding that by miles, Mass Effect 2 provides one of the most quality experiences this generation has to offer - eclipsed only by its sequel. Expanding on the story, the game features satisfying cinematics, gorgeous graphics, difficult decisions, and smooth shooting gameplay. Few experiences hit as many right notes as Mass Effect 2.

												Once upon a time, Bioware made a Space RPG that was incredibly EPIC. Mass Effect was its name, and it would be filled with many characters and character archetypes that I am still very fond of almost ten years later. The first one would have some kinks to work out, but the second one....the second one they would get almost completely right. Join Commander Shepard and his motley crew of misfits as you sail across the galaxy on your beloved ship (maybe loved by the fans more), fighting gangs, Geth, weird lizard things, oversized rodents, giant frog creatures, and all kinds of other insane races that Bioware has created, with loads of rich backstory for each one (via the codex). This game was so ahead of its time. With Voice actors like Jennifer Hale as Femshep, and Martin Sheen as the mysterious Illusive Man, it was almost impossible for this game to fail.What else can I say about this classic game. With some of the best voice acting even today, it stands above most other RPG's as a solid example of a great formula for a game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game a while ago but the flashbacks are coming back....this is my story.  I bought this game a year after it came out due to a recommendation from a friend for only $5. Within the first 5 mins. of playing the game, I suffered a seizure followed by explosive and violent♥♥♥♥♥blasts. I remember blacking out after about 30 mins. of debilitating and painful cumming. I woke up in a hospital a week later. I was told that I had cummed myself into a♥♥♥♥♥cocoon and that I need to have my testicals removed or else I would die from over cumming. To this day when I play Mass Effect 2, I still black out and have phantom♥♥♥♥♥blasts. All in all, this is probably 2010 Game of the Year. 10/10 will definitly♥♥♥♥♥again.This review was inspired by the real life events of Pete Holiday.			",150,12,1,10,4,1,12

												I cant think of another example of how gaming could be done right, better than the Mass Effect series.An epic trilogy that spans three games in which you are in control of how the story evolves around you.Mass Effect 2 lived up to everything that was expected of this great space epic and is an amzing sequel to the its predecessor.Pros:-Ability to import ME 1 character and profile-Very good animation and graphics, voice acting is great-Great Combat with new powers and weapons-Streamlined Upgrades and Weapons-Your choices shape the story (especially the ones from the first game)-Even more characters, with interesting backstories-Side quest are more tied in and diverse-Very engaging story-REPLAYABILITYCons:-Planet Scanning for upgradesBioware did a great job taking Mass Effect to the next level and clearly deserves better than being owned by EA, but the Mass Effect series is sill the best example of how passionate game making is done right.

												Mass Effect 2 is a lot like the original Mass Effect, except it doesn't take as long for the story to get moving, and the combat system has seen a nice overhaul. The game is now a bit more shooter-oriented/action-oriented, but still packs an incredible storyline.Some events in ME2 will depend on what you did in ME1, assuming you import your characters/saves from the previous game. Playing ME1 first is probably a good idea to provide understanding of what is going on in the game story-wise.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mass Effect 2 adds another chapter in the Mass Effect trilogy, and it does so pretty damn well. It's been argued this game has the best plot out of the three games, and I'd say that's a fair statement. They really liven it up compared to the first Mass Effect. That being said, you'd be doing yourself a great disservice if you didn't play the first game before this one; you won't understand what ANYONE is saying. More importantly, you'll be missing out on crafting your very own story, making those important decisions in ME1, and that's what really stands out about this series. The gameplay is more refined, and smoother than the first, but dumbed down. A lot of the RPG'ness is sucked out of this one, which some people like. You can't customize your weapons or armor as extensively as you could like in one, but it isn't a complete loss; the game is still utterly fantastic and worth your time. All in all, this is an important step in the story of Commander Shepard, and until you beat it, you'll be absorbed.			",239,19,0,29,28,2,48

												A great sequel to an excellent sci-fi game.  I personally recomend playing the first one as that is still a great game unless you are more a shooter fan than an RPG fan in which case I woudl start here.  The combat is perhaps the biggest improvement and brings the game up to par with lots of other action games.  The characters and side quests were also improved over the original.  The main downsides are the story which very much has that ""middle chapter"" feel but is still good and the rpg feel which was dialed back too much for my tastes and may turn off other rpg fans.  But especially at today's prices this would easily be one of the first games I would point you to if you were looking for a great sci-fi game to play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't like Mass Effect! Something about it turns me off, and I can't say whether the brunt of it is the bland sci-fi that nerds love or the ♥♥♥♥ing lame cover shooting mechanic. But what do I know, because I sat through the entire ♥♥♥♥ing thing and played it without quitting, so it's doing SOMETHING right. This iteration has that weird alien dude called Mordin (probably the only character I've ever liked), boring planet probing for resources instead of boring lore-filled vehicle sections (you have to collect most of the resources for the best toys, so pucker up), more cover shooting, and while it fails to be compelling... well, I sat through the entire thing. So it's doing something right. Good ambience, maybe? ♥♥♥♥ if I know, I'm not playing this again or Mass Effect 3 under threat of being smothered into unconsciousness by boring gameplay. You figure out what it is.			",452,99,7,53,31,2,53

												It's a very good game, if you like games that tell stories you're probably going to like it. The gameplay isn't anything special, but it doesn't detract from the game, it has some of the most engaging characters in gaming and it actually makes your choices feel like they matter, something the sequel fails at.

												When I first got this game I started losing my rag with it as the controls are so different, but after I got used to the controls it was fun. I can see where Call of Duty Advanced Warfare and Black Ops 3 got there ideas from. My favourite character is Miranda Lawson, she's so hot and makes Lara Croft look like a tramp. The way I got to getting this game is weird and after a conversation with a friend, catacombskitten, I was convinced to buy it. An all star cast in the vocal department and nice choices too. Another downside to this is you can't romance whoever you want to romance. I'm playing as a female but I can't romance Miranda Lawson, sad eh? To close this out my mum seems to think they should make a movie out of it.I give this 9 and half out of ten.			",85,1,0,1,7,0,1

												Mass Effect 2 is an amazing action-rpg with great third person shooting mechanics.  The combat is very fun but not what makes Mass Effect so unforgettable.  The highlight is the characters, the way you interact with them, and the choices you make.  The characters are fully fleshed out and many of the game's missions are dedicated to gaining your allies' loyalty and learning more about them.  The ways you interact with them and decisions you make in the game, or have made in Mass Effect 1, have consequences both grand and subtle.  They combine to make the game one of the most personalized gaming experiences out there.Many triple A games aim to deliver an epic experience, and I won't claim that they fail.  But Mass Effect 2 is probably the most epic game I am familiar with.  Its epicness cannot be overstated and in fact its epicness is quantitatively thrice as large as the epicness of other triple A games whose epicness is the main selling point.  Yet despite the incredible epicness of Mass Effect 2 (and I am in no way discrediting the power of epicness), it doesn't neglect to add incredible depth to its characters and choices.

												I have not finished playing Mass Effect 2, however I applaud it and its predecessor for its creative use of modern physics to penetrate, if only slightly, the vast distances that lie between stars. Mass Effect 2 also adds more realistic flight sequences, as one has to calculate how much fuel will get them to their destination, acknowledging that fuel is, in fact, a finite resource. However, it does to some extent ignore Newton's first law in that one slows to a halt the minute the ship ceases to accelerate, however, there are worse gripes to be had about a video game than ""It follows Aristotelian physics,"" as Aristotle essentially laid the groundwork for all modern thought.One of my favorite things to do as Commander Shepard was to probe undiscovered worlds, as this was something that I did in real life with the Voyager Probes. However, I doubt that these probes contained anything like the Golden Record that we put together, as First Contact has already been established in the Mass Effect universe.			",351,115,4,71,67,3,57

												Mass Effect 2 is a lot like the original Mass Effect, except it doesn't take as long for the story to get moving, and the combat system has seen a nice overhaul. The game is now a bit more shooter-oriented/action-oriented, but still packs an incredible storyline.Some events in ME2 will depend on what you did in ME1, assuming you import your characters/saves from the previous game. Playing ME1 first is probably a good idea to provide understanding of what is going on in the game story-wise.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

That's why I didn't particularly enjoy most of the missions. 90% of that is simle cover shooter. Funny is the mission compass, that  points me where to go, even though I'm still running down a corridor. Even the hard difficulty is not much of a challenge there - besides some bosses. So while I've really enjoyed the story, the characters, exploring... The base game mechanic destroys the potential of the actual gameplay. 75%			",41,0,6,13,2,0,8

												You can import the character from Mass Effect 1 and export it to Mass Effect 3. The DLCs make the story richer but AFAIK they don't go on discounts and there are a lot of them.Pros: great everything.Cons: the action is cover based heavy.Pretty good! Rating: OK, OK, but only one tentacle!Recommendation: Fantastic game, so...yes!! Also get at least the Shadow Broker DLC.http://pixelloot.com ",71,18,0,5,10,0,30

												Mass Effect is one of those games... One of those that make you think... That make you want _more_... A game that is, in every sense, much more than a game. Mass Effect accomplishes all that by having a very strong story line told through gorgeous cutscenes that blend perfectly with the action filled pace of the game.Mass Effect 2 is a game for you, whether you like shooters that have brain, RPGs or just anything as long as the package is polished and the plot is good.

												This is honestly one of the best games I've ever played.  It's main flaws are outside factors, such as hard to access DLC, with major features locked behind paywalls.But overall, the game is solid, focused and tells a story that is easy to get invested in.  You come to know your squadmates well, and the game encourages you to explore your relationships.  And of course, there's plenty of character building and shooty action.  But there's a lot of RP in this RPG, and that's in stark contrast to some newer games that claim that genre.If you like scifi, epic storytelling, romance subplots, third person shooting, or games that let you make meaningful choices, ME2 is a game for you.

The only reason you shouldn't buy this game is if you have never played Mass Effect 1, in which case you should buy that, play through it, and then import your save file to Mass Effect 2. Sure, the DLC may be a rip off and you can only get Mass Effect 3 through Origin, but this is one of the top games ever for a reason. It's worth it.			",81,8,2,6,6,1,3

												Amazing game with an awesome story. My only advice is don't play it right after you finish part 1. The gameplay is so different that you might be turned off by it at first. At least I was. If you didn't like the loot system in part 1, then you're in good hands, as Mass Effect 2 ditches the loot sytem in favor of upgrades, constant upgrades. It's fun, amazing, but part of me always missed the loot system. The story wasn't as engaging as part 1, but still amazing fun. Enjoy			",193,26,5,38,9,3,25

												Mass Effect 1 was decent for it's time, but it's hell going from ME2, to ME1. The mechanics, the controls, and the play style changed rather drastically from 1 to 2 where in 1 everything actually had damage, in 2 it's more about ""What gun do I like more and works for how I play"" but then ME3 brought back the ""damage"" by giving it damage bars.The skill sets are niceThe combat is decentBut the story. That's what'll keep you around. The storyline for this I'll admit, is a little cliche at some points, but all in all ME2 was a huge step up from ME1, making ME1 a pain to play again just to get different choices.Get the ME2 Deluxe Edition, you can use the new start mode to make choices from ME1, without needing to actually play through ME1.Wanna see gameplay and choices for ME1, head to Youtube.

												The sequel to the game that launched a universe and an epic franchise. Mass Effect 2 expands upon its origins with tighter gameplay and smooth visuals. A stripped down version in some respects compared to the first game, but not to its detriment. Gone are a lot of the more fiddly micromanagement RPG elements of sorting out gear for your teammates, as well as the long driving sections. The only tedious aspect of the game are the scanning elements of planets, but even things like this are sometimes helpful in drawing you into the universe growing before your eyes. Now if only EA would be Mass Effect 3 on Steam...			",1109,341,21,101,101,9,185

												How come I've never paid attention to Mass Effect franchise? I'm not into RPG, Star Wars, space games or something like that but Mass Effect 2 impressed me so much. Sometimes it feels like you're reading a book, there are many things to think about beyond the main story and gameplay. I belive that no matter what kind of games you like to play, if you're already wondering about Mass Effect 2 you will like this game. Now I'm playing Mass Effect 1 and going to play Mass Effect 3 for sure. One thing I don't like is the way of marketing promotion of Mass Effect franchise by EA Games\BioWare and there should be some almanac of DLCs, exclusive contents and things you have to do to get it in chronological order.

												I don't like Mass Effect! Something about it turns me off, and I can't say whether the brunt of it is the bland sci-fi that nerds love or the ♥♥♥♥ing lame cover shooting mechanic. But what do I know, because I sat through the entire ♥♥♥♥ing thing and played it without quitting, so it's doing SOMETHING right. This iteration has that weird alien dude called Mordin (probably the only character I've ever liked), boring planet probing for resources instead of boring lore-filled vehicle sections (you have to collect most of the resources for the best toys, so pucker up), more cover shooting, and while it fails to be compelling... well, I sat through the entire thing. So it's doing something right. Good ambience, maybe? ♥♥♥♥ if I know, I'm not playing this again or Mass Effect 3 under threat of being smothered into unconsciousness by boring gameplay. You figure out what it is.			",452,99,7,53,31,2,53

												I don't understand why would anyone check the user reviews of this game. Dude, this game is one of the best games out there. The Mass Effect trilogy is, in my book, the best one in the entire gaming history. By far. I don't care what anyone have to say about the third game. These games made me cry like a little b*tch.Well, let's see:PROS: Amazing and breathtaking prologue (Trust me on that one) and an incredible story. Old and new companions. Each one with an amazing back story that will make you love them. Customizable armor. Impressive armory with new awesome weapons. The perfect mix between RPG and TPS. The best game of the trilogy (And I'm not saying that the other two are bad at all). Biotics and powers are much better than ME1. Of course, all the choices you made in ME1 will be crucial in this game and you will continue your story depending on what you did in the previous game.CONS: Downloadable Content is not included in this version of the game and it's incredibly expensive to buy through BioWare Store, sadly (Story DLC's like Kasumi's Stolen Memories, Project Overlord, Arrival). Exploring the galaxy and probing for resources can be a little tiring.If you want to enjoy the game even more, play it on Insanity difficulty.			",371,40,7,38,16,3,31

												I cant think of another example of how gaming could be done right, better than the Mass Effect series.An epic trilogy that spans three games in which you are in control of how the story evolves around you.Mass Effect 2 lived up to everything that was expected of this great space epic and is an amzing sequel to the its predecessor.Pros:-Ability to import ME 1 character and profile-Very good animation and graphics, voice acting is great-Great Combat with new powers and weapons-Streamlined Upgrades and Weapons-Your choices shape the story (especially the ones from the first game)-Even more characters, with interesting backstories-Side quest are more tied in and diverse-Very engaging story-REPLAYABILITYCons:-Planet Scanning for upgradesBioware did a great job taking Mass Effect to the next level and clearly deserves better than being owned by EA, but the Mass Effect series is sill the best example of how passionate game making is done right.

												Part 2 of an awesome Mass Effect game. Improved in many ways over the original, with new story to keep you occupied for many, many hours. You continue as commander Shepard and his crew in this new story, with somewhat unique start. You meet a lot of old characters from first game as well as new ones on your journey. Make sure you kept your saves from ME1, so you can transfer your choices and story to this game. It will give you a lot of sweet flashbacks on what you did in first game, in form of mails, unique character dialogues or on the local news. It's the sequel of an incredible game that don't disappoint. Game has great visuals, voice acting, animations and character design. Enjoy.			",228,36,5,24,35,0,27

The story is the main draw, but the gameplay is fun enough to keep you invested, as are the secondary characters - who are very well written, reminiscent of characters from Firefly. Can be played linearly if you just want to follow the story, or in a much more open way if you take the time to explore. Great game.			",116,14,0,9,2,1,5

If you are just starting this is the second best place to start. I wholeheartedly recommend Mass Effect 2 and the entire Mass effect series. Its one of my favorite RPG series and one of the best Sci-fi games to be released in years. If you play the Mass Effect series from beginning to end you are in for one heck of a ride!

												This is honestly one of the best games I've ever played.  It's main flaws are outside factors, such as hard to access DLC, with major features locked behind paywalls.But overall, the game is solid, focused and tells a story that is easy to get invested in.  You come to know your squadmates well, and the game encourages you to explore your relationships.  And of course, there's plenty of character building and shooty action.  But there's a lot of RP in this RPG, and that's in stark contrast to some newer games that claim that genre.If you like scifi, epic storytelling, romance subplots, third person shooting, or games that let you make meaningful choices, ME2 is a game for you.

												Mass Effect 2 is an amazing action-rpg with great third person shooting mechanics.  The combat is very fun but not what makes Mass Effect so unforgettable.  The highlight is the characters, the way you interact with them, and the choices you make.  The characters are fully fleshed out and many of the game's missions are dedicated to gaining your allies' loyalty and learning more about them.  The ways you interact with them and decisions you make in the game, or have made in Mass Effect 1, have consequences both grand and subtle.  They combine to make the game one of the most personalized gaming experiences out there.Many triple A games aim to deliver an epic experience, and I won't claim that they fail.  But Mass Effect 2 is probably the most epic game I am familiar with.  Its epicness cannot be overstated and in fact its epicness is quantitatively thrice as large as the epicness of other triple A games whose epicness is the main selling point.  Yet despite the incredible epicness of Mass Effect 2 (and I am in no way discrediting the power of epicness), it doesn't neglect to add incredible depth to its characters and choices.

Just go to the bioware homepage and look at the DLC's for mass effect 2 to see what youre missing here.

												If you just want the barebones, straight story, then this will work. All of the DLC is still ridiculously overpriced, and the ""digital deluxe edition"" contains just the preorder bonuses.If you want the DLC you have to click the DLC link in the starting menu, open up your wallet, and proceed to let EA take whatever they want. (prices have barely come down since launch)Great game, the DLC is fun, but when the DLC costs more than the game itself, it might be time to rethink your business practices (talking to EA here, not Steam)9/10, suggest just hitting up the bay of corsairs for the DLC.*note* I bought the game on a steam sale for like six bucks (both 1 and 2) thinking that this was like, all I'd need to buy to have my full Mass Effect experience four? five? years after the fact.  Thanks to how companies handle their DLC though, my heart was saddened. *edit* I realize it looks like I just reviewed a game called DLC, and not ""Mass Effect 2"", but hey, welcome to the future.

												After 2 hours of playing, I definitely like it much less than the 1st Mass Effect game, mostly due to finite ammo, changes in UI, key mappings and attempts at forcing an EA online account on me.P.S. the game works quite fine without an EA account, you just need to press ""Cancel"" when told to create or login to one during installation.

												If you just want the barebones, straight story, then this will work. All of the DLC is still ridiculously overpriced, and the ""digital deluxe edition"" contains just the preorder bonuses.If you want the DLC you have to click the DLC link in the starting menu, open up your wallet, and proceed to let EA take whatever they want. (prices have barely come down since launch)Great game, the DLC is fun, but when the DLC costs more than the game itself, it might be time to rethink your business practices (talking to EA here, not Steam)9/10, suggest just hitting up the bay of corsairs for the DLC.*note* I bought the game on a steam sale for like six bucks (both 1 and 2) thinking that this was like, all I'd need to buy to have my full Mass Effect experience four? five? years after the fact.  Thanks to how companies handle their DLC though, my heart was saddened. *edit* I realize it looks like I just reviewed a game called DLC, and not ""Mass Effect 2"", but hey, welcome to the future.

												The second, and in my opinion, the best game in the Mass Effect trilogy. Improving upon the first game in every way, but NOT dumbing down many gameplay elements, it introduces a new, dramatic, exciting story full of unpredictable twists and turns, making it look like a spectacular, highly interactive space opera movie.The driving sections around barren planets from ME1 are gone (and replaced with planet scanning, and new driving sections if you own the appropriate DLC), even trivial sidequests have great direction, and seem important even though they do not tie in directly to the main story line. I loved the introduction of clearly Lovecraftian horror elements in the story, something that the third game completely ignored. The Reapers, ancient enemies of all sentient life, are basically intergalactic gods, dangerous even when destroyed, their huge spaceship-like bodies able to brainwash would-be explorers millenia after their ""death"". It feels you're fighting truly unknown and horrifying adversaries, which gives the game a very unique atmosphere.The characters are unique and believable, dialogue is well-written and interesting, and it's hard to leave the game once you've started playing.Playing ME1 is pretty much a requirement prior to playing ME2, though- after all, it is a continuation of a great storyline.The end is well-rounded, and even though it implies a sequel, it doesn't leave you hanging from a cliff, so to say :)Recommended!P.S. Getting the DLC for this game is a relatively hard process nowadays, thanks to EA's greedy, unoptimized and ham-handed decisions. Basically, you'll have to activate your ME2 copy on Origin, buy DLC on Origin, download them through Bioware Social website, and install them manually after installing (and running) ME2. Why would you do all that?Some DLCs (such as the Arrival and Lair of the Shadow Broker) have story-critical content, along with additional quality gameplay, which adds a lot of new content to the game. If you turn out to be a real fan of the game and hooked on the story of Commander Shepard, you WILL need to play through these additional stories, as they cover some moments heavily referenced in the sequel, Mass Effect 3.EA's way of selling DLC means they NEVER go on a sale, so be prepared to dish out some serious cash for them (individual DLC prices can be several times higher than the price of the base game!!!) and only purchase them if you're REALLY interested in the story. Also, you can safely ignore the ""equipment"" DLC, as they are really only a money grab, selling you variations of weapons or cosmetic ""upgrades"" to your team for real money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mass Effect 2 adds another chapter in the Mass Effect trilogy, and it does so pretty damn well. It's been argued this game has the best plot out of the three games, and I'd say that's a fair statement. They really liven it up compared to the first Mass Effect. That being said, you'd be doing yourself a great disservice if you didn't play the first game before this one; you won't understand what ANYONE is saying. More importantly, you'll be missing out on crafting your very own story, making those important decisions in ME1, and that's what really stands out about this series. The gameplay is more refined, and smoother than the first, but dumbed down. A lot of the RPG'ness is sucked out of this one, which some people like. You can't customize your weapons or armor as extensively as you could like in one, but it isn't a complete loss; the game is still utterly fantastic and worth your time. All in all, this is an important step in the story of Commander Shepard, and until you beat it, you'll be absorbed.			",239,19,0,29,28,2,48

												Good game, but my least favorite in the series. Being EAified practically everything is streamlined or made mainstream. Skills are fewer, you're limited to using only 1 at a time unlike all of them having individual cooldowns as in Mass Effect 1, ammo exists, and enemies can feel obnoxious rather than fun. It doesn't help that you have basically zero weapon choice as compared to Mass Effect 1, and all the worlds feel way smaller and infintely more linear.Still, the story is great, the music is awesome, and everything else is done well. Just because this was dumbed down so it woud sell to the masses doesn't mean it isn't worth playing, and is best experienced during a marathon of all three titles. If only Mass Effect 3 wasn't Origin exclusive...			",176,27,5,20,16,0,18

Just go to the bioware homepage and look at the DLC's for mass effect 2 to see what youre missing here. Edit : You can buy the DLC's for Bioware points at the homepage, download all the DLC's and link them to your steam game! This is how you can get the full expirience.

												Widely considered by most to be the best in the trilogy, and for good reason. When it hit the scene early in 2010, it was a major step up from the already great Mass Effect. Combat, characters, overworlds, storytelling, atmosphere, Interface, sound quality, choices and side-quests, all of it was greatly improved with this game, and still stands strong to this day. The story follows two years after the events of Mass Effect 1. Due to reasons I will not reveal in fear of spoilers, Commander Shepard (the character you play as) has gotten off the public eye and is working with the pro-human organization called Cerberus, to deal with a threat the authorities choose to ignore. In order to do so, squad-mates must be recruited for a Suicide Mission to get rid of the threat.  And that's where you come in. Throughout a lengthy 35-40 hour campaign, you will travel to distant and varied worlds, making tough choices that can have devastating outcomes, to gain enough manpower for your campaign. The main plot of the game is actually really simple. Like, REALLY simple, close to shallow. All you do is find out where the threat comes from, assemble a team to deal with the threat, find a way to get to the threat and then destroy it. The real meat of the game is actually with the squad-mates, in fact there are far more missions centered around recruiting characters and later gaining their loyalty through other missions. It's more of a character study than a traditional RPG (though you still get to explore fascinating locations and all that good stuff). And it works, because these are some really great characters. They're layered individuals from fascinating cultures and backgrounds, with believeable and complex motivations, striking personalities and involving arcs that really invest you in their struggles and the galaxy they inhabit. It also helps that the conversations have been much improved from the previous game. In ME1, as well as other games, during dialogue characters would tend to stand completely still, maybe move their arms a few times with a bit of a stern, not very emotive face. That still happens from time to time, but often characters will now walk around the room while they talk, or maybe the camera will move around, focus on something or give interesting angles. The much improved camera work in this game is really welcome. Here they use shadows and light, colour, as well as other things to better create a mood, which really improves the quality of your interactions.There are a lot more things I could say about this game, but what it boils down to, is that I think this is a fantastic game that you should give a try if you are interested in a character-focused game that touches on very real and difficult themes and issues in a very mature and smart way. I recommend that you import a save from ME1, since choices you made there will show up again, either to shake your hand or kick you in the balls. It greatly increases your ability to create your very own Shepard with a unique history, and that is a great experience. Score: 9.8/10			",53,15,0,5,1,0,3

												I am absolutely in love with sci-fi series such as Mass Effect. Not only does this game offer a variety of combat, dialogue, exploration, you can also do ""sexy time"" given the right scenario is placed. If Mass Effect 1 didnt convince you this game is awesome, import your file to Mass Effect 2 & enjoy. If you're still not convinced, Mass Effect 3 has it everything Mass Effect 1 & 2 could not provide you at the time. If you're still not convinced, youre probably a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bag. Joking aside, I am very pleased with my experience playing this series. Have you ever played long, dull rol playing games, where you just drown out in the background doing whatever? Dont worry this game will keep you exploration new obstacles, new dangrous missions & moar sexy time!			",129,11,0,34,8,0,5

												The Mass Effect series is Bioware's greatest masterpiece, in my humble opinion. Its writing and cinematic narrative are unparalleled in gaming. The combat improved as the series went on, and the story consistently maintained its level of quality. Player choice has never been the same since the Mass Effect games. No two players' Shepards are the same, and it is worth playing the series multiple times to see how different situations would play out with different choices.My biggest complaint has little to do with the game itself, but how DLCs are distributed. If you get the Steam version, you have to make an account on Bioware's social site, buy them, download and install them manually, and hope that you never have to have Steam check the integrity of local files. I recommend getting all three games in the trilogy pack; you know where I am talking about.Reasonable price: $20.			",216,87,1,26,10,3,40

Brilliant performances from the voice actors, brilliant writing from an excellent team, and gameplay much improved from the original. Still no jump.			",641,139,12,93,45,6,115

												As seen by many this is the best part of the trilogy, which I can only agree with. Great story, great characters, great universe, great atmosphere. Every decision counts, every dialoge feels real, though sometimes the shortened version you see when choosing your dialoge doesn't quite fit into what you actually say.You need to learn the species, the locations and the background, to really get whats going on.Played through it many times, will play through it again. Completion time about 12 hours. ",329,81,4,42,21,7,79

												The best mass effect game in the series.  Request you to purchase the digital deluxe edition of the game as this version doesn't contain all the docs for the game.  The dlcs can be purchased using bio ware points but they never go on sale.  Overall the experience of the game is amazing.  Works well with Windows 10. The game is story driven and the experience is enhanced by the game play.  Do buy this game and the best part is you can always get the people you hate killed or act like a stubborn,  arrogant person with no regret and live with a grin on your face.

												Yet another EPIC game from bioware, and the second installment of the Mass Effect Series, just as epic, if not moreso, as the first. Choices still matter,and you see some of your choices from the first game making big and little waves in your story; actions matter, who lives, who dies, who do you save....I only have 33.4 hours on steam with this game, but over 100 on Origin (more DLC available on origin). This game along with the first are beyond amazing, this second installment is much darker than the first game.  The Reapers are back, only this time they're using the mysterious Collectors instead of the Geth, whole human colonies are vanishing without a trace, no signs left behind, no struggle, nothing.  Its up to you, to find out why/how and put a stop to it.You have new companions, with returning faces, and a whole other side of the universe to explore and tame.I recommend this game whole heartedly, the graphics hold up to the test of time, the decisions still matter, and it still hits you right in the feels, and keeps on delivering with an epic stoy.

*DISCLAIMER: Don’t be fooled by my effectively non-existent playtime, I’ve beaten the non-steam verison of the game several times before.* In Mass Effect 2, you are assuming the role of the recently resurrected Space Jesus, also known as Commander Shepard. By doing so, you have the chance to kick some nasty-looking alien butts, gather an almost entirely new crew, make love and shed tears of joy, shake your @ss in the finest clubs of the Pirate Queen Aria T’Loak, make friendly conversations with an oh-so cheerful Reaper about things like 'leave the dead where they fall',  ‘assuming direct control’, 'the forces of the universe bend to me'  and ‘preserve Shepard’s body if possible’, and listen to the very model of a scientist salarian inexhaustibly singing on his terrible voice. Sounds fun, right? Well...Although gameplay-wise this game isn’t the most refined installment of the series (that title goes to Mass Effect 3 in spite of its horrible running animations) and the devs ripped out some RPG elements and the sense of exploration of the first game completely (actually, the latter part is not necessarily a bad thing, considering the tedious straggling across stark and empty terrain with the almost uncontrollably bouncy Mako was very...well, tedious as f*ck), overall Mass Effect 2 is hands down the best game in the trilogy. It represents a huge and very welcomed quality shift in the shooter part of the game, fighting and kicking butts here are far more fluid and enjoyable than it was in Mass Effect 1 with those clunky controls; the level design is finally decent and the new maps are especially memorable; and the soundtrack is so good, that I would say it’s beyond my comprehension how anyone could make such a thing...I declare here and now, that the composer Jack Wall must have been on demigod level when he composed those wonderful tunes. Of course the real bread-and-butter here are the characters. Except Tali and Garrus, they are all completely new and fresh-feeling faces. As I was getting to know them better realizing how distinct, flawed, interesting and (in deep down) fragile personalities they are, I just couldn’t help loving them more and more, which obviously applied to the game itself. This is the greatest achievement of ME2, the genuine and extensive relationships between the main hero and the seemingly plot device NPCs, the potent world-building through its characters and their lovely recruitment and loyalty missions.The biggest faults of the game aren’t even present in the actual game, which creates a kinda weird situation when it comes to evaluating it: The Reaper threat is always just lurking in the background, the main storyline doesn’t push the larger narrative forward (I mean what do we know at the start? The Reapers are coming, we are screwed, what are we going to do to stop them? No idea. At the end we know almost exactly that, nothing more...still have no idea what to do with the Reaper threat.) and the game introduces 10 completely new characters only to push the burden of closing their story arcs onto the third game. I’m sure that this situation (meaning ME2 is essentially not else than a long and exceptionally good side trip) created a big room of creativity for the devs to fill at ME2, and restricted their possibilities badly at ME3, ultimately making the second game better and worse the third.In the end, what really matters is that Mass Effect 2 is an amazing game, and it goes without saying that it is absolutely recommended to experience at least once in your life. Preferably more than once.			",252,57,6,23,11,0,41

												One day 7 years ago as a kid I was walking around the store and I see the sign ""N7"" It caused curiosty and I was interested so I picked it up for the 360 and boy... Was I in for a wild ride, immediately I went home, put it into my console I played it all day! It was marvelous! I felt like a space-fighting/ BountyHunter/ Badass commander of the Normandy. Ever since I've been a huge fan of the mass effect series, and I recently got it again for the PC to prepare for Andromeda. Anyways, enough of the life story. Should you get this game? Yes, but only if you played the first one. You will only enjoy this masterpiece of the trilogy if you play mass effect 1 then import your character into this game, due to all your actions carrying over such as ""Friendships"" ""The Death of some squadmates"" and the overall immersive experince. In my opinion this is the best out of all 3 mass effects, due to its solid-smooth combat, to it's thought out story. Quick List of why you should get this:- Play this after Mass effect 1, PLEASE!- It's combat is awesome, diverse classes to choose from. ""I recommened the Vanguard""- Story is very well written.- Character depth is outstanding.- Soundtrack is awesome.- Graphics for a 7 year old game is fantastic! QUICK NOTE: Actions matter, it can lead to a wide array of events, such as a different approach to a mission, new allies and even death of a squadmate! Take your time, don't rush. This is a story driven game, you're meant to engage in conversations.For god's sake, don't skip dialogue!			",99,12,0,24,4,1,1

												For me personally, it's way better than its predecessor. The storyline connection is great, it feels nice to meet the same characters from the previous game and the new ones are interesting. Dialogues seem to be more polished than in original Mass Effect, gameplay is more fun and feels more dynamic.Overall, it's a great game, but to experience its full potential, you should finish Mass Effect 1 first and then continue your personal story in Mass Effect 2.

I've found this game have a solid characters, and allowing us to mingle with them, having a good bonding with the characters, and giving each every one of them a good storyline. This was one strong aspect which in my opinion, is quite rare in game nowadays. The gameplay is also quite enjoyable. This game brought a good mixture of mystical element into a modern world tactical RPG game. Nice one.7,5/10 in my opinion.			",29,2,1,9,16,0,17

												So, I was a bit snarky on my Dragon Age Origins review, and this game closely follows in that vein wherein I have played this soul sucker of a game and delivered my life over to Bioware for the chance at space husband banging.  Im Bioware trash.  But, since I admit it you can take the review with a grain of salt right? Also, some spoilers because im terrible and you can hate me later.I've played a couple of times.  I like the game.  It's a great game, and I personally enjoyed the story, and the characters, and the animations, and the weaponry, etc etc.  Fundamentally, it's a good game, and made improvements to the combat system, in my opinion, over Mass Effect at the expense of the weapon and armor upgrading system that I preferred.  There are aspects that can be tedious (planet scanning, having to avoid Jacob because femShep refuses to not be a flirty ho with him, like really? Garrus is space husband not Jacob!).  There are aspects that can be infuriating (hello Kaidan, quit being ♥♥♥♥♥y!, occasional ultra sticky walls can be ultra sticky).  In my opinion however, no matter how many times I took a grenade to the face because I got stuck on cover on the front side, I still enjoyed the game.Overall rating: Recommended.  Would take more grenades to the face for Garrus.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Its up to you, to find out why/how and put a stop to it.You have new companions, with returning faces, and a whole other side of the universe to explore and tame.I recommend this game whole heartedly, the graphics hold up to the test of time, the decisions still matter, and it still hits you right in the feels, and keeps on delivering with an epic stoy.

												I really enjoyed this game.The controls were a massive improvement from the first installment, and the story was pretty neat imo.If you are new to the series, I would recommend picking up this game, the previous installment and the 3rd installment as well.

												One day 7 years ago as a kid I was walking around the store and I see the sign ""N7"" It caused curiosty and I was interested so I picked it up for the 360 and boy... Was I in for a wild ride, immediately I went home, put it into my console I played it all day! It was marvelous! I felt like a space-fighting/ BountyHunter/ Badass commander of the Normandy. Ever since I've been a huge fan of the mass effect series, and I recently got it again for the PC to prepare for Andromeda. Anyways, enough of the life story. Should you get this game? Yes, but only if you played the first one. You will only enjoy this masterpiece of the trilogy if you play mass effect 1 then import your character into this game, due to all your actions carrying over such as ""Friendships"" ""The Death of some squadmates"" and the overall immersive experince. In my opinion this is the best out of all 3 mass effects, due to its solid-smooth combat, to it's thought out story. Quick List of why you should get this:- Play this after Mass effect 1, PLEASE!- It's combat is awesome, diverse classes to choose from. ""I recommened the Vanguard""- Story is very well written.- Character depth is outstanding.- Soundtrack is awesome.- Graphics for a 7 year old game is fantastic! QUICK NOTE: Actions matter, it can lead to a wide array of events, such as a different approach to a mission, new allies and even death of a squadmate! Take your time, don't rush. This is a story driven game, you're meant to engage in conversations.For god's sake, don't skip dialogue!			",99,12,0,24,4,1,1

												Mass Effect 2 is likely the greatest sci-fi RPG of all time. I've only done one playthrough and I feel like I haven't even scratched the surface for what this game has to offer.Pros:- One of the most compelling stories in gaming history- Characters feel extremely real and dialogue with them is engaging- Great graphics for being over 7 years old - Mountains of content- Every mission has meaning (i.e. no boring fetch quests)- Your actions really do have consequences, although it may not seem that way at first- $20 is an absolute steal, I would easily pay $60 for it- Amazing endingCons:- Just another cover shooter in terms of combat- Dialogue options don't always do what you think they'll do (this is rare but still annoying at times)- You will cryIf you've never played this game, you're really missing out.

												______________________________________________________________!!!!!!!!!!!HEAVY STORY SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!______________________________________________________________Mass Effect's 1 and 2 are amazing games!the atmosphere is so good.STORY TIME!when i played mass effect 1, when i saw Tali for the first time i knew i was going to protect heruntil the very end no matter what, every time Tali needed to speak with me, i did it with open armseverything was going great!then came the final mission... i put tali in my group because i wanted shephard to protect her againsteverything collector's might have. I chose Thane for to pipes and garru's to lead second group.Thane dies while doors are getting shut, we found survivor's of normandy who were captured, i thoughtthe way was clear and signed them with no escort, they all died, then miranda lead me, Tali and Legionthrough collertor's area, right at the Legion get's taken (i didn't do he's loyalty mission, lucky orTali would have died).So we made it into the final room, we fight collector's and whatever Reaper they are creating, we win the fight. but then a cutscene comes up...Tali is sliding down into the huge pit to her death, i start ripping irl my hair while screamer at monitor as shephard lunges to save Tali. Tali's hold slips off shephard's hand is going off the edge, i start screaming, then shephard's hand graps Tali and pull's her up!, suddenly an explosion, Tali is now other side on the room now, not moving, my heart starts pounding again ""no, this gannot be!"" when shephard went closer to her, Tali awoke and signed she is ok, we helped miranda from under a huge steel pipe or something and made it to ship.I have never while playing felted like that while playing Mass Effect 2, perma death system is so great (perma death does not affect if one dies on random mission, they will get up, but in story mission's some of them have a change depending what you do)you learn to care for them (and if not for everyone, then at least for one you care) and the final mission will test you're nerves__________________________________________________________________________________!!!!!!END OF SPOILER'S!!!!!___________________________________________________________________________________i give this game 9/10, it is great game, i love the story.

												As much an Epic Story Trilogy... As it is also an Epic Video Game/Simulation Trilogy... It is so well done, that I give it Simulation level Marks. Now the Software generated Story, will be a Pretty much an actual simulation... ((Andromeda that is)) ... I recommend getting all three of the games, and all available dlc's for them... Flesh them out, and experience every available part of this Epic Story... Remember, there are a lot of copies of this Genre out now, but When Mass Effect first came out, there simply had never been any story simulation game done so thoroughly interactive, and with so many aspects to the process of exploring the experience of Commanding a series of deap space missions that the Earth's and many other world's survival depended upon... It is so much more affordable now, and PC's are so much faster, as this came out durring Windows Vista (ARRRG...), and Dual Core years, when most machines had single core Cpu's and less than 1 gig of video ram... Now you can Play this on a Six-Eight core stepping CPU, and mutiple 12gig video cards, for God's Sake Play it with Three curved monitors if you can, and Let this Baby Rock !!!!

												Mass Effect 2 is a great sequel to an equally impressive game. While I do believe that this second installment is a bit over-praised, it is still an incredible game that builds on the successes of its predecessor very well.I do believe that most components of the combat system are improved. The only small detail that I don't personally enjoy is a matter of personal preference and doesn't really bother me, as it is present in most shooters anyways. The visuals are obviously much more impressive as well and make an impact on immersion in this case. Overall, the gameplay mechanics have been vastly improved as far as fluidity and functionality.What truly matters when evaluating this title, however, is the narrative and the ability of the game to make you care about its characters and its stories. While I personally believe that the first Mass Effect did a better job of making the player care about each and every character and his or her story, Mass Effect 2 still retains the important features that characterize the NPCs and make the story memorable and cannot be criticized for a lack of story; my personal opinion shouldn't have an impact on the validity and inspiration of the title. The fundamental RPG elements of Mass Effect 2 make it stand above virtually any other RPG on the market today.Mass Effect 2 is an amazing game and is undoubtedly a must-own title.

												An absolutely beautiful game that ran well even on my old PC, despite such beautiful graphics.In combat you control a squad of 2 other people, from a pool of recruitable companions who have their own strengths and backstories. The combat is basically an FPS game with some ""magic"" abilities in the form of biotics and tech, which can be learned by companions by leveling up and spending talent points.The graphics are so great, that I did not want to use any of the free armor in the deluxe edition, because they cover Shepard's face and ruined the immersion.The sounds of the game are also great. The disco music of the first night club that you go to really sounds disco-ish.The cut scenes and voiced conversations are great. I actually look forward to talking to people because the conversations are interesting.The main story and the mini-stories of your party members are very well done.The game makes you feel like you are in a sci-fi movie.

 ""Playing Mass Effect 2 is 100 times better than watching a movie.""  Mass Effect 2 (ME2) is the sequel to the amazing Mass Effect (ME1). In Mass Effect 2, you play as Commander Shepard and recruit 12 powerful squad members (2 from DLCs) in your team to fight against the enemies. Compared to ME1, the features in ME2 have been tremendously improved and polished. Since I have played ME1, expect to find a few comparisons in this game review. The Good- Breathtaking cinematic cutscenes (So many feelings and goosebumps)- Beautiful music (More goosebumps)- Skippable conversations- Character and armor customization - Great story, unforgettable ending- Additional squad members (badass, mysterious, crazy, and funny individuals)- Same ammo used for all weapons (except heavy weapons)- Improved HUD screen and power wheel- Squad movements associated with key bindings (no more via HUD)- Enemies protections are color coded (barrier - purple, shields - yellow, armor and health red)- Space/Galaxy exploration- Progress status on space exploration- Interesting dialogs (Some of them are funny)- Shorter loading time- Purchasable mementos and pets for your cabin- No more annoying elevators- Two mini-puzzle to unlock research and credits  - Any classes can hack now (not only techies)- A few intense time limited missions- Missions can be continued after finishing the main plot- Pursue a romantic relationship- In-depth encyclopedia (Codex)- Arrow pointer in map- Tutorial at the start of the game- Introduction to newer species (Drell, Batarians, Vorcha) and creatures- Variety of alien species and enemies- Emphasize teamwork- Access to Cerberus Network (You'll get extra weapons, armor, missions and one more squad member)The Okay- Fewer skills/abilities (but it is fine since you have many squad members) - Weapons stats no longer exist (but weapons can be made stronger via research)- Specific weapons for specific classes (e.g. Infiltrator cannot use assault rifle) (but preferable than those in ME1 where weapon’s accuracy was affected)- Difficulty in reaching level 30 (possible if ME1 character is imported, completed all missions and DLCs, or continue a new game after first playthrough)The Bad - Other expensive DLCs (you'll need Bioware points to purchase them)- DLCs not sold in Steam - Mako missions replaced with probes- Possible wastage on buying probes and fuel (I did)- Scanning planets could be dull and repetitive over time- No running, only sprinting- The ""Press 'F' to Finish Mission"" blocked the dialog wheel- Failure to connect to Mass Effect 2 server error (popped up every single time after starting the game)Overall, the good outweighs the bad in Mass Effect 2. If you are a fan of Mass Effect or if you love action role-playing, sci-fi adventure and exploration, then this game is for you. Mass Effect 2 will definitely be one of the games where you will cherish the feel good moment. You will wish to replay it in the future to experience those nostalgic moments again.  Note: Be prepared to feel empty after you have finished playing this game because I do. A tip for those who are reading until this far, pay a visit to Uranus and launch a probe if you have not already.			",66,40,0,3,3,0,11

												Just like with it's predecessor, Mass Effect 2's strong suit is the story, however this time around, the story telling and presentation have been upped quite a bit. Everything feels a lot more cinematic and dialog animations feel more organic than they did in ME1. Granted, there isn't that much that drives the overall plot of this trilogy forward. You essentially just gather a group to do your suicide mission with, which doesn't even really accomplish that much as a whole. It basically serves as a build up for ME3. However what will stick with most people are the multitude of characters you'll meet along the way, most with their own backstories and quests. Just like with ME1, I'd say that the best part of the game is just talking to other characters and enjoying the scenery.The combat and leveling system has changed quite a bit, in some ways for the better, not so much in others.The awkward and clunky combat of ME1 has been replaced with a relatively standard 3rd person shooting system. Think of it as ""Gears of War with skills"".The leveling system has been quite stripped down. You no longer level up things such as weapon accuracy or Charm/Intimidation. Now all you level up are your skills. Whether or not this is a good thing is up to you. I kinda liked the more intricate system of ME1 but I understand why they changed it. It makes things simpler and not having to level up accuracy means that weapons feel less clunky to use from the get go.However as a whole, I'm still not a huge fan of the combat system. Sure, most guns and skills are mos satisfying to use, but just like Gears of War, most scenarios devolve into a sluggish cover war, where you take peak shots from the same piece of cover until all enemies in your sight dead. This is especially true if you're playing on higher difficulties. It just slows down the pace of the game. It's also kind of a shame, because some stages have interesting level design, but you only really make use of maybe 5-10% of a room during a fight.So, just like with ME1, combat is a means to get you forward in the otherwise enjoyable story of this game. But it is probably more servicable in doing so than ME1 was.Overall, I'd absolutely recommend this game if you at the very least enjoyed ME1's story and want to experience more of the Mass Effect universe. If you hated ME1's combat system, you might actually get some more enjoyment out of this game.I do however highly recommend that you actually play ME1 first, as this is a direct continuation and not a whole lot gets explained to you. Also, you can import a completed ME1 save file into this game and have all of your choices affect this game, creating an overall more personal experience.			",276,22,8,22,5,1,12

												This is the 2nd best game I've ever played in my life. It is the best Mass Effect game. Came out before EA became greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s with their mandatory multiplayer policy so I have to congratulate EA for this game. This game has a serious theme but loves to throw in warm-hearted and comical character interactions. This game helped pull me through the hardest years of my life. Voice-acting is superb and graphics are amazing for 2010. I would recommend this game to everyone out  there that considers himself/herself to be a 'gamer'. Its a definite 10/10 pyjaks			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Yet another EPIC game from bioware, and the second installment of the Mass Effect Series, just as epic, if not moreso, as the first. Choices still matter,and you see some of your choices from the first game making big and little waves in your story; actions matter, who lives, who dies, who do you save....I only have 33.4 hours on steam with this game, but over 100 on Origin (more DLC available on origin). This game along with the first are beyond amazing, this second installment is much darker than the first game.  The Reapers are back, only this time they're using the mysterious Collectors instead of the Geth, whole human colonies are vanishing without a trace, no signs left behind, no struggle, nothing.  Its up to you, to find out why/how and put a stop to it.You have new companions, with returning faces, and a whole other side of the universe to explore and tame.I recommend this game whole heartedly, the graphics hold up to the test of time, the decisions still matter, and it still hits you right in the feels, and keeps on delivering with an epic stoy.

												As much an Epic Story Trilogy... As it is also an Epic Video Game/Simulation Trilogy... It is so well done, that I give it Simulation level Marks. Now the Software generated Story, will be a Pretty much an actual simulation... ((Andromeda that is)) ... I recommend getting all three of the games, and all available dlc's for them... Flesh them out, and experience every available part of this Epic Story... Remember, there are a lot of copies of this Genre out now, but When Mass Effect first came out, there simply had never been any story simulation game done so thoroughly interactive, and with so many aspects to the process of exploring the experience of Commanding a series of deap space missions that the Earth's and many other world's survival depended upon... It is so much more affordable now, and PC's are so much faster, as this came out durring Windows Vista (ARRRG...), and Dual Core years, when most machines had single core Cpu's and less than 1 gig of video ram... Now you can Play this on a Six-Eight core stepping CPU, and mutiple 12gig video cards, for God's Sake Play it with Three curved monitors if you can, and Let this Baby Rock !!!!

												First playthrough...failed some loyalty missions, watched Yeoman Kelly (whom I was boning as a female Shepard) turn into genetic goo, made to feel like dirt by Dr. Chakwas, lost some of my favorite crew so defeating the Reaper was a bittersweet victory. Second playthrough....Succeeded in all the loyalty missions, didn't get the Noramandy up to specs, watched Yeoman Kelly turn into genetic goo (again), suffered Dr. Chawas' scorn (again) and had unacceptable crew losses (sigh). Third playthrough....Succeeded in ALL loyalty missions, got the Normandy up to specs, saved Yeoman Kelly (yes!), got Dr. Chakwas' admiration (yes!) ended suicide mission with all crew intact (yes! finally!).

You see, EA forces you to use their mega-crap software origin for downloading the DLC belonging to this game.And as all EA games they have employed someone suffering from brain hemorage to design it. You need to register an  origin account to get your stuff, then you need to download your DLC from a browser, then you need to run every DLC as a seperate EXE file.And that is not all, every time you start up your game, the origin crap-good-for-nothing built in client fails to connect to their demonic servers so you need to manually insert your origin credentials every time you want to play this. And modern things like cut and past for those of us who use password managers, nope, forget about it, and using 90:s era things like tabbing between form boxes, nope, cause EA don't know about that.I recommend this game but will rather drink from a toilet than to buy an EA game again.

												This is one of my favorite games of all time. The story and characters were great and so was the gameplay. I liked that you had to assemble your team and improve them in order for you and your team to survive the final mission. This has to be my favorite game in the Mass Effect trilogy. I would recommend playing all 3 of these games in order and importing your save each time if you really want to enjoy this. Mass Effect 2, like the rest of the trilogy, has great replay value and you can easily play it for hours. BioWare games always have a great story and Mass Effect 2 is no exception. I had previously owned all 3 of these games on PS3 but had to buy them again for the PC because they are just so good. Mass Effect was the first RPG I had really played and since then I have gone on to enjoy others. I would strongly recommend starting here if you are used to action games and want tho get into RPGs or just enjoy sci-fi. I would also recommend this to any RPG fan because it is a great RPG with an immersive sci-fi universe with an interesting backstory and memorable characters.			",107,12,2,7,3,0,8

The mass effect universe is so complex and beautiful with its many species, planets, options and choices, speaking about choices it allows you to put yourself in the game which develops how do you say a actual friendship with the characters in the game which is something i will never get over. I have logged about 50-75 hours into the series because i am shepard a commander in the alliance because i have made the choices that define me and my actions.So please do yourself a favor and play the series because this is the best series there shal be in  the gaming franchise. P.S You could think this is overhype but this is truley how i see and im writing this because my head is still stuck in the mass effect universe.			",136,11,0,12,13,1,10

I liked that you had to assemble your team and improve them in order for you and your team to survive the final mission. This has to be my favorite game in the Mass Effect trilogy. I would recommend playing all 3 of these games in order and importing your save each time if you really want to enjoy this. Mass Effect 2, like the rest of the trilogy, has great replay value and you can easily play it for hours. BioWare games always have a great story and Mass Effect 2 is no exception. I had previously owned all 3 of these games on PS3 but had to buy them again for the PC because they are just so good. Mass Effect was the first RPG I had really played and since then I have gone on to enjoy others. I would strongly recommend starting here if you are used to action games and want tho get into RPGs or just enjoy sci-fi. I would also recommend this to any RPG fan because it is a great RPG with an immersive sci-fi universe with an interesting backstory and memorable characters.			",107,12,2,7,3,0,8

												I cant stress how good this game is it is my favorite franchis of games its so good its hard to comprendi would reccomend buying the series and playing it through. The mass effect universe is so complex and beautiful with its many species, planets, options and choices, speaking about choices it allows you to put yourself in the game which develops how do you say a actual friendship with the characters in the game which is something i will never get over. I have logged about 50-75 hours into the series because i am shepard a commander in the alliance because i have made the choices that define me and my actions.So please do yourself a favor and play the series because this is the best series there shal be in  the gaming franchise. P.S You could think this is overhype but this is truley how i see and im writing this because my head is still stuck in the mass effect universe.			",136,11,0,12,13,1,10

												I simply adore this game. It is everything I would want out of a story rich RPG game. Your choices actually makes grand impact on the game as the story flows on further in a slightly or radically different direction. Lovable, hatable and fascinating array of NPCs and companions. Mass Effect 2 is a must-play for everyone that's devoted to either sci-fi or RPGs.			",21,9,0,4,2,0,3

												Ever felt like you make a whole lot of bad decisions in your life?If yes, then don't get this game. Bad decisions don't belong here. Unless you want people/aliens to die.If no, then I don't understand why you are reading reviews instead of already playing this game.Mass Effect 2 is the best sci-fi RPG-epos of all time, hands down. The only thing really competing with it for the #1 spot are it's brethern ME1 and ME3. (but that doesn't matter, since you will want to play all of them anyways. Trust me, you will)Oh, and the triology has the best story of any video game I've ever lived through. (yes, literally lived through. That's how excellent they are. These game will make you cry, or at least get you damn close to tears, sweat, laugh, and shout)So if you want to claim that you know stuff about video games and that you're a ""gamer"" or whatever:The first condition is so have played through this triology. Period.Now excuse me, gotta finish my 3rd playthrough.			",92,16,4,15,8,0,7

												Why are you reading this review? It's Mass Effect! Stop reading and start playing the game.This must be one of the best games ever made.  And although its predecessor has a more in-depth storyline and better weapons tech-tree, it is much better at everything else.While there are clear signs that the end of the universe is coming, nobody but a few believe in you.  In this game, you'll learn about the character, emotion and backstory of your teammates that will help you in your journey with an epic and mindblowing finale, accompanied with great soundtrack by Jack Wall.With this game regularly on sale for a few bucks, it is a must play for everyone.

WOW!Story:Let me start off by saying that this was the first Mass Effect I've ever played(Yes, I regret not buying ME1), it was simply beautiful in so many ways! I've seen other reviews for this game, and I gotta say - It actually is completely story-driven. Sure, there is gameplay, but mostly cutscenes, and that was suited well for this game. The optional character progression in ""Loyalty Missions"" provide extra play time, getting to know the people you recruit, gaining their trust & their respect. All in all, the story takes turns & provides new enemies to come in contact with.Soundtrack:I love the electric-orchestral vibes Mass Effect 2 brings to the table with its soundtrack! Every soundtrack definitely fits the mood for what's happening in that current situation, truth be told. The sound of electric synths with bashing drums really gets you in the mood for destroying those damn Reapers!Characters:I absolutelyLOVE each character that you recruit/meet. I couldn't seem to find a flaw in any of them, each character is written so well!1.MordinThe smarty pants of the crew, very cute as well, he learns mostly about each species he's around. As you continue through the story, he will help you with Armor, Weaponry, and squad upgrades - as well as your enemies information. Mastered in Biotics/Support.2.Garrus:Let's start off by saying that I do know Garrus was in Mass Effect 1, and meeting him in Mass Effect 2 was a huge suprise for the players. Anyways, he's pretty much the badass good-guy of the group. Caring, understandable, and pretty much down to earth savior! Mastered in Snipering.3.Miranda:My second favorite squad mate in this game, really really interesting, as well as her accent! Her excellent shot & biotic powers are damn good. Cerberus Officer for the win! Mastered in Leadership/Biotics.4.Thane:Quiet & swift, like the night, he prays before he takes the kill & afterwards as he lays down his enemies body. Thane is truly a poetic character, the vibes that come from his life makes you think how much will power you'd need in order to survive such events as he did. Mastered in Support/Snipering.4.Grunt:Brutal & large, this huge Krogan has a taste for violence & bloodlust. He joins Commander Shepard to satisfy his love for violence & to redeem himself as a true Krogan! Mastered in Fighting/Battle.5.Legion:However you firstly see it as an enemy, t provides very useful information to help stop the Collectors from defeating Humanity. Just becareful what it does around Tali, you must have high enough Paragon/Renegade to have successful cooperation between the two. Mastered in Hacking/Engineering.6.Tali:Such a sweetheart, very religious & royal. Tali is a long time friend from Mass Effect 1, as you meet her early on in Mass Effect 2, she will state that she cannot help you at that very moment. Later in the story, you must work together to fight the Collectors. Mastered in Engineering.7.Jack:Seen as a huge threat to the squad at first, but gradually they get used to her. Jack's attitude rides from stealing, killing for fun, to fighting with Commander Shepard. Dark past with this character, very saddening. Becareful how she re-acts to Miranda, you must have high enough Paragon/Renegade to have successful cooperation between the two. Mastered in Major Biotics.8.Jacob:""I'm good Shepard, ready for anything, if we win, we'll get loud, spill some drinks on the Citadel!"" Ah, I love Jacob. He's my favorite squad mate, truth be told. Some people dislike him for his doubtful attitude, but I've seen through that, and if you get his loyalty, he's pretty much your best friend in Mass Effect 2! Mastered in Leadership/Support.Voice Acting:The VAing for Mass Effect 2 is pretty awesome, I noticed some familiar voices from other video games, which was a great suprise, honestly. The only complaint I have about the VAing is that sometimes the voice does-not match the character's facial expression. But I assume that's an engine problem, not a big deal.Conclusion:I gotta say, this was an amazing experience, definitely pulls on your heart strings as well!(EDIT), Woopsie, forgot Samara. She's a very useful & royal biotic trained killer!10/10. ♥			",200,22,3,18,4,1,11

												Mass Effect 2 continues from where ME1 ended, importing your character and decisions made into the second game, or allowing you to make an entirely new Commander Shep. The graphics are better, the gameplay is more fluid, and the storyline and decision making has (somehow, I'm not quite sure how considering the excellence of the first in the series) also improved. I'd consider this game marginally better than the first and, considering I gave the first an A+, that tells you something about how much I like this game.Pros:Did what Mass Effect 1 did betterCons:Not many, although itemization still wasn't done quite rightA great series any gamer should play.

												Bioware Sci-fi Masterpiece. Monte uma equipe de humanos e aliens pra trazer ao fim mais uma vez a ameaça dos Reapers, em um universo rico e vasto, com uma das crews mais carismáticas dos games. Pra mim a maior força do ME2 é porque diferente do primeiro ele não precisa introduzir o universo novamente, e ele se foca no que a bioware sabe fazer de melhor: Personagens. Tinha tudo pra ser aquele ""middle dark chapter"" da franquia(como aconteceu com o Dragon Age II), mas foi muito bem equilibrado e teve um plot principal que se fechou em si mesmo, com uma ameaça real o suficiente. O jogo tbm não tem pena, e gera pra você consequências que serão carregadas por save ao ME3, por erros que você cometeu, ou decisões erradas tomadas.

The IP has an amazing universe thriving with interesting lore and an outstanding sci-fi storyline with amazing voice acting, combat, exploration and visuals. Mass Effect 2 is the best out of the three so it's a must-play. The DLC is some of the best addons in videogames.			",20,0,0,5,2,0,0

												Zaeed: One of the most powerful gang leaders in the galaxy, until he was betrayed.Legion: Completely unique hacker robot, envoy for a people exiled who want to belong.Jack: Experimented on to make her one of the most powerful biotics to exist. They weren't fun experiments. She's not happy.Grunt: He's basically indestructible, and really, really likes shooting things. He's also an adolescent, so that's fun.Jacob: Trained in the military, he's a straight up soldier. A reliable guy to have covering your back.Tali: A fragile-looking small girl in an isolation suit. She's an expert at hacking from a distance. Also, shotgunning enemies in the face.Garrus: He's a crack shot who led a team of freedom fighters against a series of gangs until he as the only one left. He also quite enjoys calibrations.Thane: An expert assassin with a terminal disease and a life of wrongs to right in the time he has left.Samara: Sworn an oath to uphold justice, she's spent hundreds of years hunting down criminals and her very deadly daughters.Kasumi: Expert thief, she's stolen things that were completely impossible to steal on numerous occasions. You've never heard of her. She likes it that way.Mordin: He is the very model of a scientist salarian. He has done things in his life that he knows were absolutely necessary, but that doesn't mean he won`t try to fix any damage he's caused.Then there's Miranda. She's genetically engineered to be perfect in every way, and it makes her life SO HARD. ""Oh no, shepard"" She often cries, ""I am just too perfect, my life is SO HARD."" Her only redeeming character trait is that 90% of the time she's on camera, the camera is focusing on the most interesting part of her character: the very tight clothing directly around her rear end.All in all, I give Mass Effect 2 an 11/12, one for every interesting companion.

												Mass Effect 2 is a huge improvement over Mass Effect 1. It's adapted to appeal to a wide audience of gamers while still bringing the charm of Bioware's old-school RPGs. While Mass Effect 1 (in my opinion) feels like it could have been more if the studio had more time or budget to fully develop the different worlds which could be explored, Mass Effect 2 feels complete and gives the player satisfaction in the limits of the game. Mass Effect 2 marks an important transition of Bioware from KOTOR-esque DnD storytelling (which brought Bioware to the living room) to the new era of cinematic gameplay which can be enjoyed by anyone.

												I had been playing the whole series on the PS3 version. The most important advise is, Play the original one before Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3. or in the other hand, you'll be getting a deep confusing combiner in a very unlimited rich story like this.

												Doesn't have the open world feel of the original game. It feels very isolated and as though you are not a part of the galaxy. Though the story and characters are top notch as you would expect from a Bioware game, the ending is stupid. No spoilers for those that might not have played it, just the question why?

												One of the best RPGs on steam, fantastic storytelling, difficulty that varies from Run and gun to tactical, beautiful graphics, and a good pacing. throw into that a good soundtrack, better voice acting, and ALOT of content this is one of they best buys on a linear story there is, just after the dragon age franchise.

												Mass Effect 2 continues from where ME1 ended, importing your character and decisions made into the second game, or allowing you to make an entirely new Commander Shep. The graphics are better, the gameplay is more fluid, and the storyline and decision making has (somehow, I'm not quite sure how considering the excellence of the first in the series) also improved. I'd consider this game marginally better than the first and, considering I gave the first an A+, that tells you something about how much I like this game.Pros:Did what Mass Effect 1 did betterCons:Not many, although itemization still wasn't done quite rightA great series any gamer should play.

												Bioware Sci-fi Masterpiece. Monte uma equipe de humanos e aliens pra trazer ao fim mais uma vez a ameaça dos Reapers, em um universo rico e vasto, com uma das crews mais carismáticas dos games. Pra mim a maior força do ME2 é porque diferente do primeiro ele não precisa introduzir o universo novamente, e ele se foca no que a bioware sabe fazer de melhor: Personagens. Tinha tudo pra ser aquele ""middle dark chapter"" da franquia(como aconteceu com o Dragon Age II), mas foi muito bem equilibrado e teve um plot principal que se fechou em si mesmo, com uma ameaça real o suficiente. O jogo tbm não tem pena, e gera pra você consequências que serão carregadas por save ao ME3, por erros que você cometeu, ou decisões erradas tomadas. Pra mim o melhor da série, e com certeza um dos melhores jogos de todos os tempos.			",147,25,3,15,8,2,6

And although its predecessor has a more in-depth storyline and better weapons tech-tree, it is much better at everything else.While there are clear signs that the end of the universe is coming, nobody but a few believe in you.  In this game, you'll learn about the character, emotion and backstory of your teammates that will help you in your journey with an epic and mindblowing finale, accompanied with great soundtrack by Jack Wall.With this game regularly on sale for a few bucks, it is a must play for everyone.

												A truly amazing game. 10/10 in my honest and truthful opinion. In terms of story, customization, game play, innovation with story and characters personality. Everything you do can affect the gameplay, every relationship, every bad or good action.Travel to neighboring galaxies. Harvest resources from planets. Find activity on planets and enter their atmosphere and carry out missions...Invasions on the planets. If you buy Mass Effect 1 you can transfer your character from the first game to this game. Or you can create a new one. I Personally love Mass Effect 2 over all the others.In short... I recommend this game. It is nearly flawless in all aspects of a game. $20 is nothing to pay for this game and on a steam sale it's even more worth it.			",232,25,3,33,27,1,34

Other parts are worse .. I can't believe what they did to the attribute system .. it's ridiculous now.   All in all it's not a terrible game, but not great either.

												If you liked the first Mass Effect, you will probably love this one.Pros:-You have more squad members, and each one has more depth and complexity than the original. They have personal stories and views to share, rather than exposition. A lot more character development happens, and the romances are more satisfying.-The movement and combat are much smoother.-There is more variation between the classes, making each one feel truly unique.-The weapons are varied, having different firing types and ranges, rather than just different stats in Mass Effect.Not-Pros:-The story seems to veer away from where the first game was heading. It’s still neat, but ultimately you’ll care more about the personal missions of your squad rather than the main campaign.-You need to purchase a large amount of DLC to really get the full game, especially if you want to continue to Mass Effect 3.-Thermal clips. In the first game, weapons heated up when fired, and you had to let them cool down. In this game, that mechanic has been replaced by thermal clips, which function similar to magazine in other shooters. This limits the “ammo” you have for your weapons. The old system was more fun, and made more sense from an in-universe perspective.			",117,17,0,7,11,0,32

												10/10.Hands down the best CRPG I've played. Above and beyond Mass Effect 1. Buy it if you enjoy science fiction and engrossing stories!Yes, there's more action in Mass Effect's sequel, but with the better streamlined skill trees and in-combat control, it ties in very nicely with the overarching milieu's story and lore. And it's the story that really seals the deal here. The persistent characters, the evolution of your story and consequences from choices (arguably cosmetic, they still feel tangible to me),They took everything that worked in Mass Effect 1, pared off what didn't, and made it better. It's extremely seldom that sequels are better than the originals, but Mass Effect proves exceptions do occur.Not to be left out and this isn't intended to TMI or unncessary but merely an endorsement -- this is the second game I've played (ME1 being the first) that allows for romances that I actually participated in and enjoyed. (Note to self: I seem to play a lot of women that enjoy the company of women. Who knew?)			",53,9,0,16,1,0,4

Mass Effect 2 has some of the best writing and enthrallment I've seen in a game.  A great game without playing the first one probably, but if you play them both consecutively for your first time you WILL have a new favorite game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Another fantastic game from Bioware. Every bit as good as Mass Effect 1, if not better. The RPG system isn't quite as flexible/complex as the first one, but shooting elements are more fluid. UPDATE: Just finished playing Mass Effect 3. You can't get it here on Steam due to a tiff between EA and Valve.  If you haven't picked up any of the games, find the Mass Effect Trilogy on any of the other game stores.  As far as the game, it was fantastic as expected. Some people complained about the ending, but I though it was great and a fitting end to Shepard's story. Just be sure to download the free extended edition DLC with the expanded ending, which I think is already included if you buy the trilogy. My only gripe is the cost of the DLC.  This is one of a few game series where I actually bought all the DLC, because the game is so good, but also because they never release a ""Game of the Year"" edition that includes all the DLC.  For ME3, it feels like they doubled the price of DLC, but it is not as good as the ME2 DLC.  One of the DLCs costs more than I paid for the entire game, so I passed on it.  Not happy about that, but I'll just watch them on YouTube.			",152,42,3,18,4,3,31

												Mass Effect 2, the game which makes you want to keep replaying until you get the right ending. Indeed, this game is about choices, and the wrong choice can lead to some of your members dying. ME2 has an amazing storyline, which is 10 times better than what the first was, with lots of replayibility even after you have completed it. Just everything about this game is amazing! Even though the first Mass Effect was in my top 10, it has now been replaced by this. It made me feel really bad with some of the choices I made so I had to go back and replay it to change what I had done. I would recommend this game and would give it a score of 9/10P.S: Just be warned, if you have played the first and then go onto ME2 straight after, it takes a long, long time to be able to get used to the new controls.

												(Redone recommendation from scratch)The squel to Mass Effect (1)!In the sequel to Mass Effect (1) you will continue to play as Shepard from the first game (The same character if you imported him or her) on a new quest.This time around though you will notice something almost immediately; Combat has changed!Now the game has changed around more to a cover based shooter compared to what the first game was (I mean, there WERE some cover based shooting in the first, but now its radically different) and also you are now using limited ammunition.Some people welcomed this change, some didn't. I personally am still on the fence about the changes to combat.But its quicker, more actionny than ever. Also you can only use one power at once since other powers will be put on cooldown once you activate a power (In the first game you could maybe use 8 powers at once but had maybe a minuter cooldown).The question is though, is it fun? Oh hell yes, the combat is fun. It also makes it more interesting trying other classes and trying out different choices in the first game in order to see what will change in the second game.Storytime eh? Yeah yeah.This time Shepard will be summoned by the corporation ""Cerberus"" and is tasked to find out why an alien race called the ""Collectors"" are kidnapping humans, so its up to you to find a new crew on you voyage amongst the stars and find out the grim truth about the kidnapping of humans...One thing is sure; this game is more grim than the first and third game. No dance on flowers here.While the story to me is not good as the first but the interactions with the crew and characters keeps this game going. They also cut out the unnecessarily exploration bits (Love it or hate it) and major loot collecting has been removed entirely (Although you can do some cool research/upgrades in your lab).**And yes,i need to put this into here; Mass Effect 3 mini-review!**Mass Effect 3 is the last game in the Mass Effect Trilogy. While the combat was the best out of the three (According to me), the story took a major backlash thanks to the ending.But, while the ending in the third game is absolotely horrible i can tell you one thing; The journey is a good one.The sad truth though is that if you want to play Mass Effect 3 you have to buy it elsewhere than on Steam...

												I'm a big fan of BioWare games, and Mass Effect 2 does not disappoint when it comes to great gameplay, awesome characters and a plot I can have fun with.  I played Mass Effect 2 the most out of the three games in the IP, because it has so much replay value.  Taking Shepard through different choices, or experiencing companions in different lights, be it romantic or just friends, you learn more and more each time you play.  The Mass Effect world itself is all I could ask for in a sci-fi setting.  There are not enough games like this series, and this game specifically is still my favorite of the bunch.

												So far we can tell that Tali would not smell nearly as bad as those filthy humans; her sweat's a drug and a natural performance enhancer. As for additional odors, that would be determined by MHC's and pheromones, which are too large and complex to even consider estimating with the limited knowledge we have at this time. Though the production of MHC's is also a key component of our immune system, they might be considerably less common for quarians. Remember, this is largely speculation, and I am by no means an expert; I'm merely an enthusiastic amateur. So if you think there's anything you would change or debunk in my theory, be my guest. I'd be eager to learn.But if you do agree, here's a question for you: licking Tali or licking Thane?			",217,31,3,29,9,3,27

												Absolutely one of the best games I have ever played. Incredibley well told story filled with difficult choices. Its also a really great touch that some of the things you did in mass effect 1 popped up. The combat is so much better than the original game, its also alot of fun and tactical. The characters are really well written and I found myself attached to nearly every single one of them. I also am glad they ended up simplifying the gameplay/inventory. This resulted in a much smoother experiance without all the annoying inventory management from the original. I should also note the final mission for this game is probably the most tense thing I have gone through in a long while. You cant go wrong with Mass Effect 2!10/10			",71,9,0,13,6,0,6

												Mass Effect 2 was the very first game I ever brought on its release day, It took me completely by surprise when the original teaser trailer was released, as I was a big fan of the first game - regardless of its issues -, I was hyped and could not wait for the sequel, when it finally arrived, It blew me away and remains strongly one of my most treasured and favourite video game experiances of all time.The Story takes place 2 years after the first game, without attempting to spoil anything, I'll keep it as brief as I can:On the far edges of space known as the Terminus, a mysterious enemy has begun abducting human colonies, there are no signs of any sort of attack, only that every man, woman and child is gone. as Commander Shepard, you must assemble the most deadliest and fearless team in the galaxy to travel through the Omega 4 Relay - a ""jump-gate"" in which no one has returned after using- and take the fight to this new enemy, the chances of survival are slim. A Suicide Mission.Whilst Mass Effect 1 had you travel through civilized communities throughout the galaxy, Mass Effect 2 takes you into its dark underbelly, where crime, slave trade, corruption, mercenaries and drug trafficking run rampant and freely with no ill will on the criminals part. This gives the galaxy a more intimidating feel as you travel to recruit many of the Soldiers, Scientists and Mercenaries that will assist you throughout the game.Of course, recruiting people for a Suicide Mission isn't as easy as it may sound, Missions in this game are nicely structured and area enviroments give each mission a differant feel, what makes the missions so fun is the revamped combat system and classes, combat feels satisfying, reliable and fun and the differant player classes are reason enough to replay the game, Soldiers and Vanguards are seriously a blast to play with.Everything you do in the game is building up to the Final Mission, throughout the game a sense of foreboding looms around you as you get one step closer to passing through the Omega 4 Relay, in which everyone on your ship may not return from, as your decisions throughout the game will have impact upon Suicide Mission.A highlight of this game is that each crew member has their own loyality mission, your crewmate will ask for your assistance to help resolve a past, or present issue, allowing you to bond with said crewmate and learn what makes them who they are and how they tick, the assasin character is more than just an ruthless killer, the scientist is more than just a book worm.DLC is also some of the best I have ever seen in a game, the Cerberus Network houses free Downloadable mission packs and even some bonus weapons, there are some priced DLC but all is worth picking up, if you can only choose one, Lair of the Shadow Broker.All the praising I give this game, there are only 4 issues I have with it.Weapon selection feels very limiting, alot of the customisation was removed, streamlining the experiance for better or worse, without DLC packs, you have pretty much 2 choices for each gun type (Save for 5 heavy weapon choices) with a powerful version you can obtain later on in the game.Although extremely rare, it is possible to get stuck in the enviroment, but this does not happen often enough to ruin or tarnish the experiance.Where Mass Effect 1 was fair in its Renegade and Paragon options, this game might as well force you to be one or the other, as I don't see this much as a spoiler, but I would say it is mandatory to be pure hero, or pure badass.The last point I can make a paragraph about:Do I recommend this to those that haven't played the first game?No. Alot of the revelations that will occur in the game will not go over strongly with you if you havent played the first in the series, I would strongly recommend that even with Mass Effect 1s problems, you push through it, as your decisions in the first game will be carried over into Mass Effect 2, making the story feel so much more personal to you and you alone.With all that said, Mass Effect 2 is an astonishing achievement, Winning over 90 awards and Game of the year 2010, It's graphics still impress me making the aliens and the galaxy around you feel so alive and real, The soundtrack is superb with special mention going to Suicide Missions theme itself, it's fast, fun combat with class based powers is vastly entertaining and story grips me each and every playthrough, if Mass Effect 2 isn't my favourite game of all time, it's Top 3 for sure.They say it's a suicide mission, you should prove them wrong.

												Mass effect 2 is by far one of the greatest games ever created. From story and gameplay to the amazing musical score and action packed sequences, Mass effect 2 is truely a game that rivals any other title in its generation. Mass effect 2 brings the best of the mass effect franchise to the table and completely immerses the player into its universe. From the opening scenes to the ending credits the player remains engaged right through till the end. It remains in my mind as well as in many others the best sci-fi space opera on the market as well as the best mass effect title in the series. With great companions and amazing voice talent the game pushes the boundaries in story telling and allows the player to make his or her own decisions as well as leaves them with the consequences of their actions. While some players may argue that the lack of customizeable weapons in this game takes away from the rpg experience, i would have to disagree. While customizing may be a part of an rpg i think that many gamers would agree what makes a great video game is a fantastic immersive story. The writing in this game takes you through the highs and the lows and makes you feel about the characters and what is happening in the universe, and thats something i cant say for a lot of games. If you are looking at this game and thinking about picking it up i will save you the trouble...BUY IT!! Though i havent really played the game on the pc yet, i have played each game multiple times on the consoles and look forward to my pc experience with the franchise.			",82,16,0,13,2,1,0

												Okay so the ME series was hyped by my friends so I thought I'd get it.ME1 was not a bad game but it felt really, really slow. Liked the concept and story though, so I gave the 2nd one a spin.One of the best investments of money you can do. Technically freeroam with Squadmember-quests similar to the companion quests in Dragon Age: Origins.Combat is really quick and yet tactical, don't think they could've done it better. During the storyline your decisions will make an impact on the future, and you really start to like your companions. Everybody has a story and different personality, which makes this game fun even on the 5th playthrough (this is a guesstimate, just finished my first playthrough a couple of minutes ago.)Get. This. Game. Period!Then get ME3, like I will.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To put it simply, this is one of the best games ever made. The memorable characters, great story, and interactivity of this game really made it memorable. The combat is much better than in the original game, that getting into fights was less of a chore and more fun. Every single mission felt like it had a purpose, and the lack of the cut and paste mission design was much appreciated. I did every character's loyalty mission so they wouldn't die because I was invested in the characters. This game also had some of the greatest DLC I have ever played. Lair of the Shadow Broker was incredible, and the other DLC was fun too. Overall this game is the complete package, and a good sequel always surpasses the original. Mass Effect 2 does just that.

And although its predecessor has a more in-depth storyline and better weapons tech-tree, it is much better at everything else.While there are clear signs that the end of the universe is coming, nobody but a few believe in you.  In this game, you'll learn about the character, emotion and backstory of your teammates that will help you in your journey with an epic and mindblowing finale, accompanied with great soundtrack by Jack Wall.With this game regularly on sale for a few bucks, it is a must play for everyone.

												The only one of the three I have on steam but this is arguably the best one (apart from the lack of Liara as a companion). I love bioware, nobody makes characters that feel like your actual friends quite like they do, where you actually want to hurry up and finish the mission to get back and talk more, rather than skip through dialogue to get to the action like in most other games. This is one of my all time favourite series and I'd recommend all of them.			",91,36,0,6,15,3,7

												Very nearly the full kiloI enjoyed Mass Effect 1 but was only able to give it 3/5 due to some pretty annoying flaws. I’m glad to say that most of those flaws have been eradicated in ME2. Gone are the endless slow elevator rides. Gone are the tedious, bouncy buggy rides on dull, lifeless planets. And gone is the ridiculously complex HUD. What hasn’t changed are its strong points, which remain in the storyline and RPG elements. Once again there is a detailed and compelling story along with many side plots and missions, which are more diverse and creative than those in ME1. The voice acting is excellent throughout as are the character models and animations, which are fluid and naturalistic. Graphically it’s very good for a four-year-old game, although there’s little in the way of physics, which is a shame. The combat has also improved, although it remains rather clunky and lacklustre compared to other games. The Mass Effect franchise is clearly about providing a rich and developed universe in which to place the player and to give that player a full-bodied RPG experience peppered with combat and action along the way. And in this respect ME2 really delivers. If not for the so-so combat I would have given it 5/5, but as it is I give it 4/5.			",78,5,0,6,1,0,3

												what to say? this game is a masterpiece.usually I don't like tps but this was probably the game that i enjoyed the most this year.Biowere fixed a lot of things that I didn't like of the previous chapter,now here we have a smoother gameplay,here it's pretty hard to get lost in the maps (in the first one i used to get lost at every damn moment ) and they decided to introduce the ammunitions.the story is simply fantastic:although if you didn't like the first chapter i reccomend to you to play the second one,like I did			",117,2,2,11,10,0,13

												This game should be called @ss Effect instead. For some odd reason, I've noticed Miranda Lawson has the hugest @ss in this game, and for some odd reason the game's camera likes to focus on it @ss much @ss possible. If you talk to Miranda in her office, you will be gauranteed to get an @ss shot somewhere along. Other than her @ss, this game does offer a lot of huge features too, such as tapping dat @ss of Miranda's. The story is well done and the game mechanics were greatly improved upon from the first Mass Effect title. 10/10  would check out Miranda's @ss again			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really enjoyed and will enjoy this game because of it's gameplay, story, characters and music. The characters are mainly not boring NPCs you take with you to a mission, while you are on offtime you can talk to these NPCs and learn about their past or create relationships with them. The story is fun and has alot of replayability. The mechanics of this game can be sometimes clunky but still are enjoyable.

												The gameplay is little bit different than the first Mass Effect but the storyline just as good. Many new interesting NPCs in addition to recurring characters from the first game. The missions are more interesting than the previous series because the levels are better defined compared to ME 1 where the interior of any building looks very similar.There is wider selection of squad members so you can employ many different tactics according to a mission's need. The squad members also have unique personalities and history that they can share with you, given you spend some time to talk to them. The loyalty missions, squad members confrontation with each other and romance really adds flavour to the game. Squad members can die in the final mission (dubbed as the Suicide Mission) resulting from failing to secure their loyalty, not making ship upgardes or choosing non-ideal person for a task in the mission. This forces the player to carefully plan and prepares for the mission. The were so many different way the game progress and ends, even the main character may be killed in the suicide mission. This gives the game a very high replay value and the player did get a bonus to the character and resources should we choose start a new game after finishing one. Overall, Mass Effect 2 is a story rich game that continues the greatness of the first game. If you want to play the game, I suggest you finish ME1 first and carry forward your character into this game. Forget about wikis and walkthrough (except when you completely stuck of course) and just follow your heart and be yourself when making decision throughout the game and you will find out the Commander Shepard you're playing really reflects the person you are (Paragon and Renegade choices). You always can play it again later if you want to experience another options that you missed before, or choosing different character to romance or whatever different options the game can offer. But remember, the outcome of the decisions can be carried to Mass Effect 3. For score, I'm giving ME2 a solid 9/10			",71,8,1,6,3,0,7

												Best game in the series if you ask me.+ Good story+ Exciting missions+ Lovely characters+ Good graphics+ A world that you're invested in- Limited customization.- Few choices in talent point placement.- Almost no open world elements; very little exploration.- Not many choices in weapons or tactics. Throw, lift, shockwave and singularity are also very weak since all kinds of protection block the effects. You have to push through the shields/barriers/armor to use those abilities effectively, and by then you can just keep firing until the enemy's health bar is gone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Apart from Half LIfe 2, I would say that MASS EFFECT 2 has an excellent dialog and voice acting. But be carefull because choices you make can have consequences! Story is very deep but I will not give you any spoilers about this game incase if you hadn't tried it yet. Trust me it's worth of money and one of my favourite games to play!Cons : -    Cerberus Network is clunky-    Main story is full of holes-   If your choice crosses the designers whims, the designers win-    Too many incongruities with original game-   Side missions can be distracting-    Underwhelming end-    Predictable plot-    Lots of text can be tedious-    Vehicle handling is a bit irritating-   Oversimplified equipment management-   A few boss fight gimmicks9/10 For a worthy game!

The amazing thing is that while importing your last savegame from Mass Effect 1, the plot is totally affected while everything you did during Mass Effect 1 is now ""remembered"" in Mass Effect 2 while playing through the story line.The graphics are absolutelly AWESOME, with a whole new bunch of special effects, a totally different and new set of dark environments.And of course the music selections kees the player in the mood at all times.Just as the developers stated ""Mass Effect 2 is light years ahead from Mass Effect 1"".

												Belated review. Refer to my previous recommendation for Mass Effect 1 for general thoughts on the series (short version: get it). Continuing on that, Mass Effect 2 takes everything that was great about ME1 and makes it better, and at the same time completely fixes everything that was wrong. It's the perfect sequel. The only slight misstep in ME2 is the tedious planet mining mechanic. But aside from that, I really have no complaints about this game at all. It's an absolute must-play if you have any interest in the upcoming ME3. One of the coolest aspects of the series is that all of the choices you made in ME1 carry through to ME2, and will further carry through to ME3... and there are many choices to be made. It becomes a very personalized game. I should also mention that there are a number of DLC missions available as well, which are worth checking out (especially the last one). And with that, I shall say no more, as this is a game that must be played, not written about.			",828,379,20,113,78,6,151

I love it so much, you can sink in it's own world so easily, the world of ME2 feels so alive, everyone reacts to the things you do, it's a feeling of a world being alive I had in Fallout 3 the last time, and it's (besides Bully which is an amazing game too) the only game I had such a feeling in. (Wow, this sounds kinda stoned.) I can JUST recommend it. It may be that I like the game so much, just because I didn't expect much, to be honest, when I bought it I didn't even wanna install it. Then I watched like 2 Reviews of it and started playing it. But still, you should really get it.I REALLY don't know how anyone could give this game anything under 80			",250,71,17,26,57,5,34

												Mass Effect 2 is without a doubt a worthwhile addition to your gaming collection, although the story begins to fall apart when compared to the first game's relative masterpiece.I consider Mass Effect 1 a great game, but Mass Effect 2's story and ""choices"" do not succeed it well enough to keep it in the same league. The gameplay itself is worthy, as always.Unfortunately also that this uses some third party user management, outside of Steam. I avoided any interaction with it successfully. Would prefer if there had been some work done releasing this game, and it's DLC, more smoothly on Steam.			",176,23,1,9,6,0,20

												A highly anticipated sequal to the genre-defining excellence of Mass Effect, we have Mass Effect 2. I may be some filthy casual with a love for choices, RPGs, and hot pixelated women - but damn it, this is my review!Ahem.Mass Effect 2 continues where Mass Effect left off, leaving Shepard in a rough position between those who are hesitant to believe his claims and that of a rise in human political power. Taking things into his own hands, Shepard is required to find a new crew - and embark on a mission that could very well be his last.The gameplay is streamlined from the previous, enjoyable, though with its own shortcomings. The shooting is perhaps a bit more fine tuned, not that the first really warranted much issue. The addition of ammunition makes for a more traditional shooter feel, which I didn't mind - seeing as how it's explained in the very first loading screen (though I have a couple questions). The only downside really is the large departure from Abilities in place of Shooting. Classes sucha s the Sentinel and the [Insert other Tech class here that isn't the stealth class] feels a bit unloved, and even Vanguard seems to have been lacking its zeal.The soldier and the stealth class lead in this game, it seems - given their weapon-natures and ability to dish out the love with many of them. Playing as a Vanguard through all three games, ME2 seemed to have the least options for my progression.Having said that, I'm a sucker for character development, and I really appreciated the handling of many of the Mass Effect characters. Some have a traditional 'you helped me, I love you know' mentality - whereas others feel more real. Jack seems to really soften, though I've never gone through with a romance with her. The relationship you can build with one of the previous crewmates is rewarding as she didn't just pounce on you in the first game after you punched your locker in anger for saying nice things to her. She has a developed character, and I doubt my restraint in using the name really fools anyone.I'd try to continue, but I've typed enough. Buy the game, play it. If you hate it, damn son - that's hard. If you love it, then we probably share some opinions on Sci-Fi and RPGs.Was it a worthy sequel to ME1? I'd say so. It may focus more on action, so if that makes it Gears of Halo, then I guess it's a good thing I never saw it that way. The exploration is reduced in favor of a more freeform progression with a number of characters and personal options. If I had to choose, I'd say ME2 was probably my least favorite installment in the entire series - however, that's hardly an insult.(Yes, ME3 was a fantastic game - minus the last six minutes or so of the game. But my opinion on the need for the Dark Energy ending is an entire matter entirely.)			",128,13,1,21,4,0,11

												This was initially a joke review about how this was the best dating sim ever made.After thinking about it, I've concluded that's actually true. I had more fun with this as a dating sim than I did as a sci-fi shooter. Talking to the characters, interacting with the world, and making myself as cool as possible were my main focus while playing this.Let's face it, the combat is okay, but it's not why I'm here.Yeah, I'm gonna stop the Reapers and all that, but of course I am.I wanna know, and see, and talk to everything and everyone in the meantime.I continue to think that this game is worth a recommendation.This was yet another Xbox 360 repurchase. It runs better on PC for damn sure.			",113,14,1,17,2,1,10

												The best of the Mass Effect entries. More polished gameplay than Mass Effect, more interesting concept than Mass Effect 3. By the same token, it lacks some of the visual and auditory style reached for by the original Mass Effect in favor of space mariney-ness, and the set pieces are smaller than the huge scripted sequences of ME3. Also, at the end you shoot a 50ft Terminator in the eye.			",392,122,1,55,22,3,51

												The story in this game is good, but the gameplay is what kills it for me. The areas you venture through are basically point A to point B with a maybe one or two different ways of getting there. The environment looks cool and all, and the game does a great job of looking like a futuristic world, but you can't help but feel like you're in a hallway that leads you to your goal. Which is fine, but at least give me a few ways of getting there. The main reason I can't recommend this game is the gameplay. While the story, voice acting, and dialogue are all great - the gameplay is lacking. Firefights are just tedious and boring. I usually use the sniper to take out the idiot enemies further back, then the pistol or assualt rifle for the ones closer up. Still the combat is so dull and unchallenging. I'm sure it probably gets better later on in the game, but I'm over 6 hours in, and it just isn't doing it for me. The squad abilities are cool and all, but the fact that you can finish almost all firefights without using them at all lets you do just that. So the abilities end up being flash instead of a necessity. There are little things that bug the hell out of me. For example if you decide to switch to the sniper rifle, but accidentally click on the grenade launcher, you have to switch to the GL and then switch to the sniper rifle. Even thought the game is basically paused, you can't cancel your mis-click and re-click on the weapon you wanted to switch to. Then the AI on the enemies isn't the greatest. They'll stand near the edge of cover, and you can easily shoot them. But instead of moving away to protect themselves they just keep taking fire until they poke out to shoot or die. Also, they pop out to shoot on a timer it seems like. The enemy AI is so predictable it takes away any difficulty.The game is positively received by most, so you should probably give it a shot anyways. But I just wanted to share my opinion. Personally I dislike the game, but that doesn't make it a bad game. The story, voice acting, characters, environment, are all great, but the gameplay leaves me bored.			",51,1,0,5,3,0,2

												Ok so where to begin.Mass Effect 2 is a awesome game, so is Mass Effect 1 BUT since its with EA thats just... ya know... horrible :\i got the Mass Effect Collection thinking it came with all the dlc's if there was any but nooo for me to get any of the dlc's i had to go onto another site to download them and install them but i still didnt have the good dlc's which means i was missing them (Shadow broker, Arrival, Aegis, Overlord, Kasumi, ect.) and if i wanted to get them i would have to pay bloody $40+ to get BioWare points which i aint gonna do and also i have to get them on origin So... yea... NO... (i cant really do that cause i aint got no visa and i havent seen an origin voucher ever)why does EA have to be so greedy like come on why do we have to pay another $40+ for a bunch of dlc's which is only gonna last a couple of hours at mostapart from that it was pretty good like the game play was awesome, it had an extremely good story, the graphics are good (i did find a few bugs like the fish going out of the tank) In the end i just really hate EA for making this stupid decision  ",107,9,1,15,21,3,11

												A solid sequel for Mass Effect 1. The story is interesting, the visuals are fantastic, and the gameplay works. I personally prefer ME1's gameplay and story over this one but it's still a game worth playing. If you're into third person shooters, this is your game. I'm not so I didn't enjoy it quite as much as Mass Effect 1. ME1 was more of an RPG than a third person shooter while here it is the opposite.----[Rating weighted based on the genre]----Story: 3.5/5Gameplay: 4/5Challenge: 3.5/5Discovery: 3/5Replayability: 3/5Aesthetics: 4/5Visuals: 4.5/5Atmosphere: 3/5Music: 3/5			",112,13,8,16,16,1,21

												I played this game a lot when I was younger (like, A LOT), so I returned to see if it's still is like the old times, and boy if it isn't. This is one of the few games I have next to no complaints about. - The graphics are beautiful, possibly better than some games that come out today - The combat is exciting with the big arsenal and variety of powers- All characters are interesting, especially your squad members; they are not just hollow shells that follow you around, they are actually people you begin to care about, and your decisions decide whether or not they will remain loyal to your cause- Dialogue is simple, but effective, and actually feels like you're talking to people, not just some NPC- The space travel aspect is awesome- There are so many alien races to interact with- THE ♥♥♥♥ING CODEXI can't say anything about the story, since I haven't really completed it yet, but I am definitely liking it so far.So yeah, buy this game.

The in-game Codex by itself is enough to delight science-fiction fans, but the depth you see brought by the dialogue and the story is nothing less than mind-blowing.This is still the best game on Steam today.

												/A great sequel to the original Mass Effect with several returning characters and more. Several new guns, and even greater graphics. Stellar voice acting and unique characters. However fans of the entire trilogy will agree that this was beginning of the DLC-itis affecting the series and also in the grand scheme of the whole trilogy's story, a stepping stone and a chance to bring new characters. Also you'll see some of the choices are slightly less ""morally grey area"", but still retains the spirit of the Mass Effect. Several RPG elements of the game are somewhat sacrificed, some for better, some for worse but overall, the experience and impact of your decisions make this a very very very entertaining game. 9/10.

												Completely disregarding all of the awful DRM stuff and bad UI overhaul, I've composed a list of reasons why this game sucks, as compared to the first one. The intro starts with 2 characters talking who you don't care about, nor will you ever Then your ship explodes, in no way advancing the plot because they just bring you back Everyone pretends that you didn't just spend the entire last game fighting the evil Cerberus corporation Commander Shepard actually gets a conversation option saying ""What's Cerberus?"" Shepard, despite being a spectre, takes orders from some guy you don't care about Everyone conveniently forgets about the reapers or anything that happened last game Jacob, Ashley, and The Illusive Man are completely useless characters plot-wise When you actually do make a decision, it doesn't matter. (see: Shepard demanding he doesn't want AI on the ship) Hacking minigames are actually skill-less matching games now AMMO, despite having ammo-less guns in the original Can't change equipment unless at a specified place to do so Psionics are now worthless Teammates are now less valuable than ever before Fewer, and less humorous, Elcor New spiky-teethed race of aliens shoehorned in, conveniently immune to all diseases which doesn't make sense, biologically speakingAll-in-all, you'll find yourself skipping dialogue and cut-scenes for the first 3 hours of this game because no one says anything useful or interesting with an awful UI and key-bindings that has ""Use"" and ""Sprint"" bound to the same key, poor optimization, over-burdening DRM, and just all-around ♥♥♥♥♥♥ness in what was otherwise a perfect game previously.In all fairness, I haven't finished the game yet, but it's not about the destination, it's about the journey, and if they journey's rubbish, how good can the destination really be?

												I have to say, I've always been a huge fan of Mass Effect, I mean it is Admiral Han'Gerrel vas Neema, but there's just something about 2 in particular. It's just so rich with characters and interactivity, you can do so many playthroughs and still laugh at grunt mimicking, or Mordin singing, or just learn more about the story every time, I've truly been a lucky person to have discovered Mass Effect when I did, because it's really grown on me, I would reccomend this to anyone anywhere who enjoys a fun, enjoyable, intense, satisfying experience.

												Without spoiling anything, at the end of the game there is a chance some of your squadmates may die. This happened in my playthrough, and the fact that I genuinely cared shows Bioware did something right.Really though, some of the squadmates more well written than the main storyline, and that is despite the main storyline being very good.In addition, the general gameplay is much less clunky than it was in Mass Effect one.This game easily gets a 10/10 from me.

												Mess Effect 3 is the first Mess Effect games i played but i suppose ME2 is even better. Actually I've played ME2  many times through its 'pirate' version as i can't buy it in china so this is my pay back for bioware. Wonderful story and the combat is harder than ME3.

												Quite possibly the very best game experience I've ever had. This is, however, due in large part from playing ME1 first and establishing history in both the game and within myself. The first was great too, but there were certain aspects about it that made it boring and/or frustrating at times. For example, combat was too short. The skills in teh game are designed for more of a prolonged battle to use flanking techniques and weapon strength mixtures... that sort of thing. In other words, battles could be fun, but it was rarely long enough to fully enjoy and the time between battles was quite long in lots of cases. Inventory was a constant burden as well, which also took away lots of enjoyable play time. Others might say it was too boring, but role playing games are simply more designed around a story. And this story of Mass Effect is absolutely wonderful. That said, they fixed the inventory and leveling problem completely in ME2, as well as the lack of combat. Add an extension the story that got even more eipc and you have what I believe has been my best gaming experience ever.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First Review in my career.  I have more like 60 hours as the internet went out for a while as oppossed to the 40+ that is shown.  I have played through the game 2 times once (and most recently) as a male Shepard and another as a female Shepard.  Copnstructive critism is wlcome as well as advice because I plan to review some of the other games I have.  So please, enjoy.   Disputably, this is the superior game in the Mass Effect Series.  Personally I hold this opinion, but do NOT just buy this game.  In order to get totally immersed in the story and develop connections to the characters, purchase the original Mass Effect and possibly Mass Effect 3 (but use Origin at your own peril).  The story itself is extremely engaging.  Traveling the galaxy and assembling a suicide squad is interesting as each character is found in different places and missions associated with the character's loyalty to you are also unique.  I never once came across a moment when I thought ""I've seen this before"".  While enemies are mild repeats (you will be fighting armored aliens, sheilded ones, boss ones, and various types of mechs), the NPCs are always very interesting even if they are flat.  The role-playing aspects of the game are handled well.  When starting the game, you can choose between 6 different types of combat styles which range from being a pure biotic (using magic), an infiltrator (turning invisible), and being a soldier (regular combat grunt/bad***).  Each of those classes have 5 upgradable abilities that either give you interesting ammo mods or special attacks like slamming a person to the ground or turning invisible for a short time.  On top of that once you chose your character class, you can select another special ability from a list.  Every time you level up, you recieve one point for spending it on abilities.  Initially, all of them cost 1 point and once they are upgraded, they incriment (go up) by 1.  At the end of the skill bar for each skill you can chose a significant bonus ability.  For an ammo mod, this could be giving yourself an upgraded form of it or allowing your entire squad to partake in it.  The latter thing I find most useful because I tend to hang back and pick off enemies from range and let my squand soak up most of the enemy fire.  Speaking of combat, I love this 3rd-person style.  It leans heavily on cover and utilizing the abilities of your allies.  You can direct your 2 squad members simply pressing a key (one per member).  To use your abilities and your squad member's, you hold down a button and select the ones you wish to use.  Your team can deploy at most 3 separate abilities (one per person).  Aside from that, regular combat with guns is point, aim, shoot.  You can hold a maximum of 6 guns, however this depends on which class you pick in the beginning.  The adept class doesn't even carry weapons while the soldier can hold all 6.  You can have a sniper rifle, assult rifle, shotgun, speical weapon (missile launcher,mini-nuke launcher, etc), pistol, and submachine gun.  Acquring of these weapons range from finding them in levels, recieving them, and making them. There is melee combat, but it is rather sloppy.  If you were to use it (which I don't) you leave yourself open to enemy fire which will destory you if you aren't in cover even on the easiest difficulty.  The enemy A.I. is capable of flanking, putting down suppressive fire, and charging indescriminantly, so it always keeps you on your toes.  Sometimes the enemies get stuck behind obstacles, but the pathing for them are solid.  They use cover and can go through your suad members quickly.  The graphics are exceptional even for a game from 2010.  The textures are good, but in combat it really shines.  The laser beams, mass-effect bullets, and ammo mods are a sight to behold when they are flying everywhere.  The sounds are also good.  The soundtrack is also pretty good.  The place where this game falls short is the map system.  Like from the previous game, you travel across the galaxy using Mass Relays.  That is carrried over, but the actual physical exploration of planets and moons from the previous installment is scraped in favor of a mining minigame which is tedious to do for an extended period of time.  It is also worthwhile though as the resources you get from mining is used for upgrades which are found in the course of missions and from purchashing them.  The upgrades are rather significant improvements which range from increased damage to reduced cooldowns to even additional equipment for the ship.  I highly recommend consulting your team for ship upgrades because they will make the difference between life and death in the late game.  Some do cost a lot of stuff, so you will get aquainted with the mining monstrosity.  However, this is overshadowed by the characters you interact with.  While I briefly went over this in the beginning, I feel I must describe how great it is.  Every character on your ship have a story, opinions, and remarks about your progress.  And yes, the infamous romance options are back and ""better"" than ever.  I will let you explore them to see for yourself because I have not explored them yet.  The lore is wonderfully explained to you through the codex, accessable via the pause menu.  As you interact with more things, the condex articles explain everything.  Overall, I give this game a 9 out of 10.  The strong character customization/upgrading system teamed with the strong graphics, good teamwork elements, and the immaculate NPC collection are what make this game a must-own for Sci-Fi fans.   If you are bored by generic first-person shooters and want a more engaging combat system, this is a good game to look into.  I know that there is a multiplayer to the game as well, but I have not exlpored it.  I would suggest skipping it.  To me, this is a single-player experience through and through. So long and good luck.			",34,1,0,9,3,0,10

												I compare every game against the Mass Effect trilogy. The Mass Effect games are the centerpiece of my gaming experience. Mass Effect 2 is simply beautiful. It has an incredbile story and some great memorable characters. If you played Mass Effect 1, you're experience in this game will be riveting. It's rare for a game to suck me into it's story, Mass Effect 2 deliveries on that front. The gameplay has some improvements over the original Mass Effect, and that's saying a lot. The gameplay experience is somewhat more intuitive and the freedom you enjoy in terms of your choices is very satisfying. The combination of action and RPG are a great balance. It's been a few months since I completed this game and I'm still pondering some of the decisions I made.Mass Effect 2, and the entire trilogy for that matter, will provide you with some of the best experiences a gamer can ask for.

												This game should not have been released as it is and unless you are following the Mass Effect storyline I am tempted to say skip this game.The controlls are a big step down from Mass Effect and clearly ported from console without streamlining them for PC. But the biggest problem is the clipping, you WILL get stuck ALOT.So what is good about ME2? - Story and characters in this awesome journey!If you are looking for a single game I suggest choosing ME och ME3 and give this one a miss. If you love epics and have the gaming time to put into this go for the whole series, you will not be dissapointed despite the two huge shortcomings.[another playthrough] This clipping is getting to me, I want to bring the character to ME3 but it is becoming a chore.

												Combat system is defintely improved compared to the original Mass Effect. It connects the storyline from ME1 very well, and is a great sequel. New squad members add new combo possibilities to firefights. Sunk several DAYS of my life into this game, and I do it again on occasion. This is one of the few games that has amazing replay value.

												Following on the heels of one of my greatest gaming experiences, Mass Effect 2 does not dissapoint. The game inetegrates decisions made in the first game in suprising ways and the story line thickens even more. The perfect analogy to compare the games of Mass Effect story-wise is the old Star Wars trilogy. ME 1 is like A New Hope, everything is new and exciting. Mass Effect 2 is The Empire Strikes Back, the story is a little darker, and more serious and things aren't what they seem to be. Old Friends have left you, Your new friends will die. Like I said, the story is one of the greatest tales I've been lucky enough to experience. A great 2nd act that sets up the end to the trilogy perfeclty.			",65,10,1,10,6,0,31

												Mass Effect 2 is a masterpiece. It features some of the best combat, interesting missions and by far one of the biggest and most compelling stories that has ever been told in a video game. From the original they continued the story of Commander Shepard and his/her role in one of the biggest sci-fi universes ever seen. The game instantly sets out being darker than the previous game with the immediate destruction of the Normandy and Shepards death. Fortunately Shepard is reconstructed pro-human organisation Cerberus. They outfit Shepard with a new crew, a new ship and one mission. Deal with the Collectors.Without spoiling the story the adventure you go on is full of thrills, twists and moral choices that you can make, and an elaborate dialogue selection that influences the story. There are numerous interesting characters to meet on the way who join your crew, each with their own background and personality, including the return of Garrus, Tali, Joker and Dr Chakwas to the crew from the first game. The combat is extremely engaging and creating a new game upon the completion of an old save is worth it just to choose a new class an experience battle in a different way. The inventory and weapon management has been improved since the first game and it is now much more fun to use biotics and tech powers. There is so much to this game it is hard to express in a small review so I shall use this closing statement.A legend that you craft. 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Though this game lacks the great overarching story of the first game, it more than makes up for the fact with improved combat and storytelling.  Unfortunately when simplifying the combat Bioware also stripped out almost every RPG feature sans skill tree, and dialogue wheel.  Overall this is the best game of the series, and also has some nice DLC add-on:  Lair of the Shadow Broker, Overlord, Zaeed, and Kasumi.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The controversy with EA and Mass Effect 3 being an Origin exclusive when that program was getting considerable bad press for spyware and peeking into people's computers remains a bitter memory for me. It went from my #1 wishlist item to becoming the first and most trying test of my resolve to never buy anything from EA again. I still have never played Mass Effect 3 because of it, and might not ever because of other issues that that game had. Though... not having played that allowed me to be insulated from ME3's ending, which♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥a huge number of fans of this series off enough that it led to Bioware redoing the ending (a bit).What does all this have to do with my opinion on ME2 do you ask? Well, it's important because it points out that I ended the series with ME2, and therefore cannot make a review of this game in context as the middle part of a trilogy, but just as the second chapter to a story that I may never finish. So how is it? Well, ""#1 wishlist item"" might have tipped you off to this: it is one of the best games I have ever played. Which is why that ME3 stuff bit as hard as it did for me.It is true that this game is considerably different from ME1 in its gameplay, and some don't like the loss of some ""traditional"" RPG elements that resulted from that. But it wasn't a real problem for me because it also got rid of much of what was wrong with ME1 and replaced it with a more solid game attached to the quality storytelling that the first game had. If there's anything bad i'd have to say about the gameplay, it's this: it plays much more like a shooter than an RPG in combat (which can be exhausting for a game this long), and whoever thought that planet scanning stuff would be fun needs to have their head examined. Preferrably with a sledgehammer. Oh and a note about how Paragon and Renegade are lame and limiting on your ability to roleplay stuff (kinda did in the first game too, but not as much).But that's it. The gameplay is solid, reasonably difficult at times, and, if you imported your save from ME1 (which you did because continuation of your specific storyline is a major selling point of this series), it makes for a great storytelling experience. This game is a smaller, more personal, story than ME1, which leads to considerable investment into the characters in your party. It's a mix of excellent characters, with a few notable standouts that probably are obvious due to their huge fanbases. And the answer to the question that just popped in your head is no. I never romanced Tali despite her being one of my favorite characters. I never played a male Shepard beyond the intro level of ME1. Come to think of it, I never romanced my favorite character (Garrus) either.And it is this focus on characters that makes the final mission of this game all the more affecting. At least the first time you play it and/or if you don't just grab a guide. Seriously, for your first go at the final mission, or really this whole game in general, don't read a guide. It will ruin it for you. And if you play it without knowing what's coming like I did, then you are likely in for one of the darkest and tragic final missions of any game out there when those party members you have spent dozens of hours getting to know and like start dying like flies. It makes the term ""suicide mission"" much more impactful if you go in with nine party members and walk away with only two and feeling lucky for that.And that's all i'll say about the gameplay. I think this is a great game, and even my sour feelings about ME3's various controversies did not dampen that opinion. Still, I would only play this if you went through ME1 first, because importing saves is cool. Whether or not you want to continue beyond this into ME3 depends on how high your tolerance for EA's BS is. Mine, sadly, is nonexistent.Have fun. :)			",243,94,1,62,44,2,65

												My favourite game (and it will stay like that for some time), Mass Effect 2 delivers a great story within this excellent RPG. I didn't really like the way the game starts and some controls are really horrible for keyboard users (sprint, cover and interaction are on the same button), but after a while it starts to become great. The game is filled with quests and manages to deliver a nice story while you're playing it. I really reccomend playing Mass Effect first, because this game imports your save file and all your important decisions with it (although you may change your appearance and class at the start of the game). Choice is again an important element of the game and it makes it into a personal experience. The combat mechanics are again pretty good and the ai is a bit smarter than in the original game. The voice acting is once again great, as well as the supporting characters whose personal storylines make the game even better.One minor flaw exept for the pc controls is that the graphics aren't always the best (low-res textures), even on the highest settings, but you need to keep in mind that the game is getting pretty old.Windows 8 users might need to use Windows xp sp3 compability mode and (if you're using it) you need to turn of Lucid Virtu MVP to play without crashes.Summary:Story: 9,7/10Gameplay: 9,5/10Graphics: 7/10Sound: 8,5/10 (+ excellent voice acting)Score: 9,8/10			",46,9,4,8,7,0,14

												Quite possibly the very best game experience I've ever had. This is, however, due in large part from playing ME1 first and establishing history in both the game and within myself. The first was great too, but there were certain aspects about it that made it boring and/or frustrating at times. For example, combat was too short. The skills in teh game are designed for more of a prolonged battle to use flanking techniques and weapon strength mixtures... that sort of thing. In other words, battles could be fun, but it was rarely long enough to fully enjoy and the time between battles was quite long in lots of cases. Inventory was a constant burden as well, which also took away lots of enjoyable play time. Others might say it was too boring, but role playing games are simply more designed around a story. And this story of Mass Effect is absolutely wonderful. That said, they fixed the inventory and leveling problem completely in ME2, as well as the lack of combat. Add an extension the story that got even more eipc and you have what I believe has been my best gaming experience ever.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

And if you play it without knowing what's coming like I did, then you are likely in for one of the darkest and tragic final missions of any game out there when those party members you have spent dozens of hours getting to know and like start dying like flies. It makes the term ""suicide mission"" much more impactful if you go in with nine party members and walk away with only two and feeling lucky for that.And that's all i'll say about the gameplay. I think this is a great game, and even my sour feelings about ME3's various controversies did not dampen that opinion. Still, I would only play this if you went through ME1 first, because importing saves is cool. Whether or not you want to continue beyond this into ME3 depends on how high your tolerance for EA's BS is. Mine, sadly, is nonexistent.Have fun. :)			",243,94,1,62,44,2,65

												Though this game lacks the great overarching story of the first game, it more than makes up for the fact with improved combat and storytelling.  Unfortunately when simplifying the combat Bioware also stripped out almost every RPG feature sans skill tree, and dialogue wheel.  Overall this is the best game of the series, and also has some nice DLC add-on:  Lair of the Shadow Broker, Overlord, Zaeed, and Kasumi.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Before we begin: This game is a masterpiece and one of the best games of the recent years. Huge respect for Bioware/EA for creating a Universe this rich, immersing and believable. But as with nearly all Bioware games, characters and writing from heaven meet mediocre at best gameplay, so if you're looking for an interesting gameplay experience, you're dead wrong here. This is a typical cover-based third person shooter and nothing else. But the stories it has to tell are so great that I've replayed this game over and over again and can call it my favorite game ever. Buy this game.Now I will ramble a bit about the story. While I try to keep it spoiler free, you should skip this part, if you want to start this game absolutely blind.Commander Shepard, the player-created main character from the first installment of the series, ends up working together with Cerberus, a pro-human organisation that often crosses the lines of morality to achieve what it regards as good, to stop the abduction of human colonists by a mysterious alien race called the Collectors. The games theme is darker and grittier compared to Mass Effect 1, and you're really free to handle any situation the way you want. And while you can't part from your boss, it's your choice to become a good guy or giving in to your dark side and getting the job done no matter the costs. Both sides of Shepard are so well written that he/she is easily one of the best video game characters ever.Your Party members are even better than the already very well written one from the first. And while some characters don't seem very interesting/likeable at first, digging further through their pasts unveils deep, twisted at times, personalities that bleed quality. Also they have different views and opinions about you, your employer and the mission. While some are fanatically loyal to Cerberus, others hate the organisation with the heart and soul, which leads to interesting conflicts.I'm sure you've heard about the train wreck ending of Mass Effect 3, even if you have no interest in the franchise. Well, the ending of Mass Effect 2 is absolutely fantastic. Doing side missions and upgrading your vessel really has an impact on   the outcome of the final battle, which is something great. And the way it was presented to us is so good, my jaw literally fell to the floor when I first played it.SPOILER ENDFrom the technical side, the graphics have massivly improved compared to the washed out, low-detail textures of the first game, although the overall texture resolution is really bad from time to time. The art style of the game is great and easily as memorable and immersive as Star Wars or other behemoths like that. And the fact that Bioware created a Universe that can rival franchises that feature books, movies, comics and more over three decades, just for a video game franchise is simply amazing.So buy this game if you're interested in a amazing story with the option of choice and rich, memorable characters, if you can stand yet another stereotypical third person shooter.

												For me personally the best game of the series by far. I really enjoyed the time playing it and getting to know the characters, the story took me in the most from all three games. I can't imagine playing the game without finishing the first part. It's a bit more action oriented game than the first one but that's definitely a plus. Sometimes it gets a bit repetetive after a while, especially with the side missions, but hey - which game doesn't these days. But once you attach to the characters and the storyline, the gameplay itself goes kinda sideways and I still mean that's a good thing and you focus on the progress of the story and the crew and everything. Also - I loved the final decision part and hated the boss fight, which pretty much sums it up. Anyway, I enjoyed Mass Effect 2 as much as only few games in my gaming life.			",213,27,9,23,14,0,27

I found myself on the edge of my seat more time than not; not to mention heartbroken, overjoyed, and so many other emotions. The worst part about this game is that I didn't search every nook and cranny of the universe in order to make the game continue; I hate how it's actually over.

												The second game in my all time favourite franchise!Completed it 6 times and don't regret a thing!Continuing on from the adventures of the first, you'll encounter new enemies, meet up with old friends and make new ones to once again save the galaxy from an impending threat. You'll also be able to further explore cultures of the various other species in the game, adding more depth to an already expansive universe. Importing your save from the first game makes the experience even better, carrying over key choices you've made in the first game, allowing you to meet up with other characters that you may have helped out in side missions in the first game and also rewarding you with bonus credits and resources right off the bat plus more!Highly Recommended! (DLC Missions are also worth playing, escpecially if you plan to play Mass Effect 3)			",130,17,2,12,5,1,2

												A worthy successor to the original. That being said, some may not like the changes from Real-Time RPG style combat to a more Gears-of-War esque third-person hybrid shooter style of combat. Still a fantastic game with an evolving story. Reccomended if you played the first; even if you didn't, still worth picking up.			",157,13,0,23,7,1,1

												JK ME1 NEEDED IMPROVEMENT and it got it but the changes between me1 and two were very jarring. UI and combat functions were so much easier in ME1. What is this bull about needing fuel and ammo? Not having ammo was the best part of ME1. Why would you take that away from me.tbh it's still about as fun as ME1 and the story parts are just as good (I can't believe I went for the straight romance on my first full playthrough though I am a horrible person) but they have added enough new and extremely obnoxious features that they are somewhat detrimental to my enjoyment of the series. idk maybe I'll be able to ignore them once I get farther in, but still. edit: yeah i was def able to ignore them and now i miss them.why ammo. I hate having to find ammo. And trying to figure out weapons upgrades is ridiculous. What did you do to my galaxy map. wtf is this hacking things now *taps on keyboard* im in. and the medi-gel thing too (although I am actually okay with how they changed the health meter and stuff, it's more Halo-y). WHY AMMO.upd8 to this review: I feel like I'm playing DnD, but I didn't get to roll the character. This new character was based on my old one, but I'm now sorta Chaotic Good at best instead of Lawful Good, and my DM is an over controlling **** who specifically designs the campaign to not let me switch ever, driving away all my old loved ones because I am forced to work for the bad guys I was specifically investigating on the side for their illegal experiments and xenophobia, none of which I am about. AND xe's making me scavenge for ammo. What the heck.upd8 to my upd8: having beaten the game, the stupid ammo thing gets less annoying over time, but it's still annoying and I don't like it. However, I freaking love that sniper rifle I call 'er Vera. It makes up for it. The Chaotic Good thing also still stands and why is there not an option for me to punch the **** out of the Smoking M- I mean the Illusive Man?upd8 many months later: yeaaaaah so I'm replaying ME1 now and. There are some things I definitely don't miss in ME2. So my first opinion is now incorrect.			",97,23,0,16,21,0,16

												Mass Effect 2 is a masterpiece. It features some of the best combat, interesting missions and by far one of the biggest and most compelling stories that has ever been told in a video game. From the original they continued the story of Commander Shepard and his/her role in one of the biggest sci-fi universes ever seen. The game instantly sets out being darker than the previous game with the immediate destruction of the Normandy and Shepards death. Fortunately Shepard is reconstructed pro-human organisation Cerberus. They outfit Shepard with a new crew, a new ship and one mission. Deal with the Collectors.Without spoiling the story the adventure you go on is full of thrills, twists and moral choices that you can make, and an elaborate dialogue selection that influences the story. There are numerous interesting characters to meet on the way who join your crew, each with their own background and personality, including the return of Garrus, Tali, Joker and Dr Chakwas to the crew from the first game. The combat is extremely engaging and creating a new game upon the completion of an old save is worth it just to choose a new class an experience battle in a different way. The inventory and weapon management has been improved since the first game and it is now much more fun to use biotics and tech powers. There is so much to this game it is hard to express in a small review so I shall use this closing statement.A legend that you craft. 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mass Effect 2 is the biggest and most well made of the Mass Effect games. It is massive. Unlike in ME3, where you can only freeroam a couple of tiny spots around the Citadel, in ME2, you can free roam around massive spaces in the Citadel, Illium and Omega. I was incredibly surprised! In ME3, you have like 3 choices of where to go in  the Citadel, such as Earth Embassies, Presidium Omertia hospital and some other crap like that. In ME2, there is a massive space. Why did they leave out places like Illium?? Anyway, this review is about Mass Effect 2. THIS GAME IS HUGE! I cannot stress that enough. Following up to Mass Effect, Bioware dramatically improved the character relationship system. Your squadmates now offer loyalty missions which you can complete and they begin to trust and respect you more. I found this quite awesome. To be honest, the ME series is the only series that made me feel any sort of emotion that wasn't sadness and frustration. I enjoyed making friends with virtual aliens. I enjoyed traveling halfway around the universe to get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on by Collectors and their fancy♥♥♥♥♥indoctrinated swarms of zombies. At times, the gameplay can be very repetitive. Kill some enemies, move forward, loot bodies, hack systems ,move forward, one of your squadmates says something, move forward, kill enemies, interact with an enemy, gain paragon or renegade. kill them.That is the basic formula to most missions.I am also pleased to see that they improved on the Normandy piloting system. In ME1, the Normandy was shown as a icon. Now you can see it, you can fly around using the mouse and you can scan planets with an awesome scanner that shows you mineral readings. The storyline advances forward, introducing new friends, enemies and continuing the story of the Reapers and you stopping them.Great game, best game in the series, what more can I say?

												So the Mass Effect series is amazing, The third Mass Effect, due to EA's continual flighty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tting, is only available on Origin, so those of you looking for that solid 10 out of 10 (well, except for the ending) will not be finding it here.HOWEVER, I can inform you that Mass Effect 2 is still worth your time. It is relatively easy to pick up the series at this game and still know what the heck is going on without having to play the first game, which is often stated as being pretty ""meh"" compared to the rest of the series. Perks of this game are good character customization, the new ability to romance some of the alien crew, good combat gameplay, non-linear storytelling, excellent voice acting (especially from Femshep), and AMAZING story / lore, whether you chose to play as paragon or renegade.The gameplay great for a game from 2010, even though I now laugh at how Shepard runs in the second game (it is pretty comical). Keep in mind, though, that if you choose to play as a Sentinal (my choice in class) your raised shield matrix DOES NOT automatically activate at the beginning of combat, as it does in the third game. Make sure you do that, folks, or you are wasting class perks!The fact the storyline changes based upon Shepard's critical decisions in the game gives this game HUGE replay value and the story / avatar are importable from the first game and completed files of the second game.The main missions were excellent, but some of the necessary loyalty missions are a touch dry, but I found that Amara's and Thane's were very refreshing, especially when I got some renegade point-free oppertunities to go all badass and theaten to chop off a guy's balls and sell them to a Krogan.I may not run like a cheetah or fight like a Krogan but I sure as hell can dance, flirt, and hold my liquor better than Commander Shepard!!

												Auch. That's all I can think of starting out with. This game hits you so hard that you are going to stay glued to it day after day. Not just this specific iteration of the trilogy, but the entirety is just honestly speaking my favourite ""game"" of all times. No game I've played before, could force me to read a bible of back-story and lore like this game could. Having played the three games some hundred hours at least, I don't think there is much new information people could give me about this game. While the first game does have a bit too much of a grinding feel to its combat, the second and third simply perfected the style of a 3rd person shooter/RPG. I can warmly recommend this game to any that still haven't tried it.			",111,5,2,13,20,0,27

												The original Mass Effect was about the story and the setting, which was fantastic for a lore junkie. Unfortunately, the gameplay itself was somewhat slow and deliberate. Mass Effect changes all that.The story is much tighter, more focussed and personal. Your crew are fleshed out, and writing characters has ever been the strength of Bioware's team. Combat snaps from point to point, with the character being much more fragile, but also quick and active. Overall, a vast improvement.ME2 is well worth playing, even years later. A+.

												Mass Effect 2 is superior in most categories of the first one. While there has been a shortage of Mako ridings, they are made up for in probing (somewhat). Elevator rides in the Citadel have been replaced with...stairs. While there is a lack of RPG elements (Micromanaging weapons, wide variety of skills to spend), the characters make up for it.  There will be some old allies along for the ride, and lots of new ones. There is a character for everyone, whether it be a crazy psycopath littered with tattoos, or a reformed avenger (among others). Action is more heavily worked on, and makes it feel better compared to the first game. Conversations have been improved on, and interventions from Shepard can take place in most situations, whether you want to push a guy off from a high building, or give him a chance to give you some answers. In conclusion, Mass Effect 2 is a great continuation in the Mass Effect series.			",194,19,0,15,3,3,24

												Awesome game! Just as good as the first. The combat has been simplified, but it is no less fun. Storyline continues from the previous game, quite literally actually, since you can import your character from the previous installment! Sweet! (it works just as well starting with a new ""Shepherd"")			",127,8,2,9,2,0,5

												ME 1 was pretty good. ME 2? Now that's a real masterpiece. This game is less monotonous than drive and shoot and ""Tell me about _____."" There's different characters in this game as well as some familiar faces. The battle system gets a bit of a remake, so you don't have to pause and command; you can command on the fly. Also, Shepard is a pretty hilarious renegade.			",61,7,0,4,0,1,8

												Following on the heels of one of my greatest gaming experiences, Mass Effect 2 does not dissapoint. The game inetegrates decisions made in the first game in suprising ways and the story line thickens even more. The perfect analogy to compare the games of Mass Effect story-wise is the old Star Wars trilogy. ME 1 is like A New Hope, everything is new and exciting. Mass Effect 2 is The Empire Strikes Back, the story is a little darker, and more serious and things aren't what they seem to be. Old Friends have left you, Your new friends will die. Like I said, the story is one of the greatest tales I've been lucky enough to experience. A great 2nd act that sets up the end to the trilogy perfeclty.			",65,10,1,10,6,0,31

												This game is f***ing amazing. Alright, alright. The combat basically plays like a cover shooter and the RPG elements are severely lacking. But, buuuuut. If you like story driven immersive games then you will love Mass Effect 2. You don't need to have played the first Mass Effect because most of the lore is transferred through dialogue and codex entrees so you'll be just fine, but if you have played Mass Effect 1 you will feel alot more connected to the world and to Shepard's companions. On the point of companions, the characters in this game are just great, they are excellently voice acted and by the end, hell by the middle of the game you'll feel genuinely connected to your companions. The choices made throughout this game kind of matters in the game but if you play the whole trilogy from the first Mass Effect then you'll see the real effect of your choices on the galaxy. So what are you doing reading this review, you're wasting time not playing Mass Effect 2, buy it now and save the galaxy.			",64,9,0,21,8,0,11

												Bioware seems to have perfected story writing, at least at this point in the trilogy. They lose some points for changing the control system completely from the first game, and from the stantard fps control; it would be O.K. except for laziness in not teaching the dialogues to adjust to custom controls. It hurt in a few time-sensitive, unique settings.Ammo was a big change and having the entire canon universe switch in two years is a little hard to swallow. I guess that with the addition of regenerating health, they had to make your character weaker somehow, and they dump loads more enemies on you this time around. I kind of missed how easily you could get pwned in the first one, even while I mowed down armies in this game.Dislike the shallow skillsets of the characters. Companions literally have 3 abilities, and then a bonus one after loyalty missions.These are the only problems, and literally every other part of the game is, at worst, 7/10. I rate 88/100 overall. Will probably play again.			",46,2,0,7,2,0,2

												A solid sequel for Mass Effect 1. The story is interesting, the visuals are fantastic, and the gameplay works. I personally prefer ME1's gameplay and story over this one but it's still a game worth playing. If you're into third person shooters, this is your game. I'm not so I didn't enjoy it quite as much as Mass Effect 1. ME1 was more of an RPG than a third person shooter while here it is the opposite.----[Rating weighted based on the genre]----Story: 3.5/5Gameplay: 4/5Challenge: 3.5/5Discovery: 3/5Replayability: 3/5Aesthetics: 4/5Visuals: 4.5/5Atmosphere: 3/5Music: 3/5			",112,13,8,16,16,1,21

												I played this game a lot when I was younger (like, A LOT), so I returned to see if it's still is like the old times, and boy if it isn't. This is one of the few games I have next to no complaints about. - The graphics are beautiful, possibly better than some games that come out today - The combat is exciting with the big arsenal and variety of powers- All characters are interesting, especially your squad members; they are not just hollow shells that follow you around, they are actually people you begin to care about, and your decisions decide whether or not they will remain loyal to your cause- Dialogue is simple, but effective, and actually feels like you're talking to people, not just some NPC- The space travel aspect is awesome- There are so many alien races to interact with- THE ♥♥♥♥ING CODEXI can't say anything about the story, since I haven't really completed it yet, but I am definitely liking it so far.So yeah, buy this game.

												Pretty solid visuals for a 2010 game, cool level design, a bunch interesting characters, hours of content... A very rewarding sequel overall, though the build variety feels kind of lacking in comparision to the first one, and IMO the use of coverages in shootout sections should be an option and not a must.In conclusion: if you like action rpg's, sci-fi and thrid-person action, you won't regret playing this game at all.Seriously, one of the most solid sequels i've ever played, if not a perfect example of what a sequel should be.

The characters are interesting and engaging.  The story is freaking amazing.  A very cinematic game.  Replayability is insane, too.  I would definitely play the first game before playing this one, despite how the original Mass Effect hasn't aged well.  AT LEAST use the Genesis DLC to understand the story form the first game if you choose to miss out on the original.   (if you do, you are wrong.)  BUY THIS GAME.			",312,83,4,33,11,3,31

												Buyer beware:Read all the other reviews for the glowing praise that I would only be repeating, I am simply giving a warning.  The ""digital deluxe"" version includes next to no DLC despite the misleading title.  Do not expect to be able to play Lair of the Shadow Broker, Arrival, or Overlord.  Kasumi Goto likewise requires a purchase to have as a follower and Zaeed Massani appears to be completely unplayable as a code is not provided with the Digital Deluxe Edition and a download/purchase is not listed on Bioware's website where the rest of the DLC can be purchased.Similar to Xbox Live, purchase of Mass Effect 2 DLC for the PC requires purchase of ""Bioware Points"".  The total cost of all DLC listed above is 2480 points and once again similar to Xbox Live, these points can only be purchased in predetermined amounts.  This results in being able to purchase 2400 or 2800 points, leaving either a deficit or a surplus,  meaning you are forced toeither not purchase certain DLC or essentially throw away some money due to an inability to use the remaining points effectively.  Overall, purchasing game changing DLC costs $35 and all DLC costs $50.Other DLC such as cosmetic changes and weapon/armor add-ons are also not included in this edition, but are not game changing and add no additional content beyond minor tweaks to the game.  Make no mistake, the full edition of this game costs an additional $35 to the $30 required for the base game, meaning the full Mass Effect 2 costs $65.  Buying the game while 50% off brings it down to $15, making the full game cost $50.Despite everything listed above, I recommend the game as it is my personal favorite sci-fi RPG and the base game while on sale for $15 is definitely worth it.

												Let me make this clear from the start... I don't think this is better than ME1. Yes, it has a couple of very well implemented new features, but it also removed some of the best features of the first one. Let me explain why it has some shortcomings. First of all; they removed the elevator loading scenes, which is actually a major plus. They also removed the random loot, and the ability to upgrade these weapons. Now, I'm one that loves loot so why oh why did they remove it ? I really hope they will implement it back into the third one. And why remove the optional buggy ? It was kinda cool (but not always fun). A major plus is that there are different planets, a few of them with their own atmosphere. I really wish there were more of these planets because there weren't enough of them. Maybe something for ME3 as well. Last but not least; it's shorter. Know this, it's a great game and you really should play it, but if you loved the first one like I did you might get disappointed.[Rating: 92/100]			",1661,635,69,221,194,16,225

												Would you read or watch a trilogy and then stop right before the end? Do you like cliffhangers that will never be resolved? Do you like to having the feeling you are in control while playing a game, only to be railroaded into doing something stupid later on? No? Then this game is not for you. Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2 are solid, if not excellent games. They have their flaws, but I can live with them. But it is a continuous storyline that runs across three games, not two. Mass Effect 3, the third installment, not available on Steam, but only on Origin, has a very controversial ending that ends the trilogy on a sour note. If you've somehow missed the controversy, just google Mass Effect 3 ending, read some of the many things that have already been said about it, and weep. Weep for the loss of something that could have been epic. Weep for the hurt feelings of countless gamers. Weep for the sorry fate of a couple of epic fictional characters, that felt like friends to so many of us.If you think you will be able to live with the above and also love RPGs, and especially if you liked Mass Effect, then by all means, buy this game now, no hesitation, just make sure to get the Digital Deluxe Edition and the various add ons. Or just keep reading and then make up your mind.Mass Effect 2 continues the story that began in Mass Effect, but with some changes. You need to assemble a new crew and won't be able to play with your friends from Mass Effect, with two exceptions, although there is DLC that will allow you to play, briefly, alongside Liara as well. A very large part of the game is spent assembling a team for a mission that will determine the fate of the Galaxy. Although it is a roundabout way, it does allow you to make new friends and new enemies alike. With a better game engine, the game looks far better than Mass Effect and is much less dated. You can now select additional actions, good or bad, to determine how your character, Shepard, is viewed. The various classes are structured differently from the first game and you no longer get a new weapon every 10 metres, there are far fewer flavours availble. But although it is certainly different from Mass Effect, it is not vastly different. The voice acting is excellent, the music is good, the storyline could be a bit better and straightforward, but is still very good. In and of itself, it is arguably the best game in the series.The only real drawback of this game is the lack of a satisfying ending in Mass Effect 3. So be aware of that before you purchase this game.			",53,2,0,11,13,0,35

												While the game stalled out for me in the middle (I took a months-long break between the first 12 hours of this game and the last 12), once I came back to it, I couldn't put it down. Story. Character. Exploration. This game has it in spades.The one downside to the game, on Steam, is that the DLC isn't here.			",141,42,3,19,10,2,30

												I wasn't even interested in science fiction or story-driven RPG's before Mass Effect. This game changed my mind. The story and universe is AMAZING. In my opinion, Mass Effect 2 is just as good as 1 on everything except gameplay mechanics, where it is very much improved.  So addicting. Can't wait until I finish building a new computer so I can play Mass Effect 3.11/10			",72,17,0,12,15,0,12

												Buyer beware:Read all the other reviews for the glowing praise that I would only be repeating, I am simply giving a warning.  The ""digital deluxe"" version includes next to no DLC despite the misleading title.  Do not expect to be able to play Lair of the Shadow Broker, Arrival, or Overlord.  Kasumi Goto likewise requires a purchase to have as a follower and Zaeed Massani appears to be completely unplayable as a code is not provided with the Digital Deluxe Edition and a download/purchase is not listed on Bioware's website where the rest of the DLC can be purchased.Similar to Xbox Live, purchase of Mass Effect 2 DLC for the PC requires purchase of ""Bioware Points"".  The total cost of all DLC listed above is 2480 points and once again similar to Xbox Live, these points can only be purchased in predetermined amounts.  This results in being able to purchase 2400 or 2800 points, leaving either a deficit or a surplus,  meaning you are forced toeither not purchase certain DLC or essentially throw away some money due to an inability to use the remaining points effectively.  Overall, purchasing game changing DLC costs $35 and all DLC costs $50.Other DLC such as cosmetic changes and weapon/armor add-ons are also not included in this edition, but are not game changing and add no additional content beyond minor tweaks to the game.  Make no mistake, the full edition of this game costs an additional $35 to the $30 required for the base game, meaning the full Mass Effect 2 costs $65.  Buying the game while 50% off brings it down to $15, making the full game cost $50.Despite everything listed above, I recommend the game as it is my personal favorite sci-fi RPG and the base game while on sale for $15 is definitely worth it.

												Let me make this clear from the start... I don't think this is better than ME1. Yes, it has a couple of very well implemented new features, but it also removed some of the best features of the first one. Let me explain why it has some shortcomings. First of all; they removed the elevator loading scenes, which is actually a major plus. They also removed the random loot, and the ability to upgrade these weapons. Now, I'm one that loves loot so why oh why did they remove it ? I really hope they will implement it back into the third one. And why remove the optional buggy ? It was kinda cool (but not always fun). A major plus is that there are different planets, a few of them with their own atmosphere. I really wish there were more of these planets because there weren't enough of them. Maybe something for ME3 as well. Last but not least; it's shorter. Know this, it's a great game and you really should play it, but if you loved the first one like I did you might get disappointed.[Rating: 92/100]			",1661,635,69,221,194,16,225

												I haven't played much of this game in Steam, but I have put 100 hours of this game on the Playstation.  This game is very entertaining.  Mass Effect 2 continues Commander Shepard's story for keeping the galaxy safe.  Many of the original characters return, but some may or may not be dead depending on what you did in the first game.  Even though I think this version does not include Lair of the Shadow Broker or Kasumi's stolen memory (which if you trust EA I would definetly recommend you buy them they are very very good DLCs), this game is still very worth it.  Gameplay is much better than 1, making it easier to get in and out of cover.  They did take away crouching which was kind of usefull, and the team this time around is much more expansive.  If you are planning on getting Mass Effect 2, you can play it without playing the first one though you kind of are missing a lot of decisions which kind of help with making your Shepard super badass (I didn't play the first one since it had not come out on PS3, but when it did, I bought it in a flash and went through 1,2, and 3 about 4 times)  Buy It, it is worth every penny. 10/10			",559,109,11,68,50,7,65

												I liked Mass Effect even if it was a bit clunky on the technical side. I could see it had great potentian but the first part felt like Bioware was not sure what they want to make of this game.I really liked the atmosphere and the world they created so I decided to give the second part a chance.Now I'm in love with it.It's one of my personal favourites and one of the best games I have ever played.Just do yourself a favour and play it.I wish I could forget it and play it again and again...Don't skip the first part before playing ME2 unless you really can't stand it.Don't rush these games as well as try not to load/change choices and you'll enjoy the experience a lot more in my opinion.

												Эту игру можно не любить, но пропустить никак нельзя! Считаю что каждый человек, который любит космо - оперы, космические корабли, внеземные цивилизации, да и просто считает себя любителем игр, должен поиграть в Mass Effect 2. Яркие персонажи, за которых переживаешь (кроме Джек, но это мое мнение), развиваются по ходу игры. Отличные миры, разногласия между расами, интриги. Сюжет просто шикарен. Когда от тебя зависит судьба не только человечества, но и всей галактики - ВАУ! Шикарный саундтрек, который не стыдно добавить к вашей любимой музыке. Я считаю что игра отлична, она лучшая из трилогии. Это одна из игр, в которую не скучно возвращаться!Оценка 9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the first things to note about ME2 is that, especially with relation to the PC version, this game was originally intended for controller use.  This is primarily because there is a one-button-do-all feature that, while the mouse may provide more accuracy for hacking and small tasks (aim assist in console versions making up for accuracy loss), shows us that this game is intended for primarily ""A"" button usage.  The PC versions DO NOT feature any controller support, and the 'mods' that are out there do not let you properly use your weapon/power selection radial, making them completely pointless (in my opinion, maybe if you memorize it it'll work, but the stick is still inverted-upsidedown on the menus).To get deeper into the controls, there are a number of people who like to jump on those who indicate that the controls are clunky, compared to other TPS games.  First and foremost, I would address that Shepard can apparently only sprint for about 4-5 seconds.  Now I get that he is in a space suit, but that armor is pretty thin given his actual size and is likely light-weight so that should not be slowing him down, and if he is a military trained individual we should all hope that sprinting would in actuality be near-infinite since his normal movement is a light jog at best (thinking in comparison to Gears of War or Army of Two).  Now to get to the cover combat; yes it's nice that he sticks his head around the corner like it's realistic, but there are many places where for some reason you cannot aim around corners for no reason, unless you are perfectly locked into the flush-opening position.To wrack on the controls a little bit more (which aren't bad to get used to, but lets face it Resident Evil 4 had better mobility at higher skill training), there is no intentional crouch and zero jumping, and very few places where you can actively leap over cover despite a very slight slide into some cover spots.  The lack of jumping has created a number of instances where, for example, the character gets stuck on top of a medical bed with the only fix being to reload your game (hope you used your quicksave) due to the lack of full world programming.  Not being able to crouch greatly reduces the ability to move throughout the battlefields as well, and makes you feel like a derp sandwich running around with your head up between cover spots.  So for all of you who have said the controls are not clunky or are looking for a smooth combat experience, you now have a nice detailed explaination of what to expect and why, compared to other games, ME2 is still lacking.However, the game is not 100% a combat game, probably not even 50% to be honest, so this really creates less problems for game enjoyment than I make it out to be.  The dialogue is really fantastic, especially in that when you choose a dialogue option it is what your character is thinking, not your exact words.  You can effectively play the game from a Cpt. Picard standpoint, making just about the right decision and resolving issues in an acceptable manner.  However, city affect (yes I mean 'affect', not 'effect') and conversations really do feel like KotOR, almost like it's just a reskinned version of the game with surprisingly more realistic characters.  The paragon/renegade options do work nicely in the dialogue, which is enjoyable to watch in and of itself and good that it is since it makes up a large portion of the game.  Unfortunately, there is no chance to fail in dialogue options, most likely to ensure that all dialogue is spoken and not simply text-based.  A trade-off most gamers can live with for the experience, but limits replay value to an extent.  I mean lets face it, many gamers would be quicksaving before every room and reloading if they didn't get their dialogue to go the way they wanted if there was a chance to fail.Overall the game is very fun, and I do recommend at least experiencing Mass Effect for the visuals and cinematic feel to the game, though the lore seems a little cheesy at times with how it is presented (though that could just be satire).  Also it's very odd to deal with well-known actors voices; I spotted Seth Green's voice immediately but had to look up when I heard Martin Sheen's; I knew I knew that voice!  It's a nice touch in the end however.Final rating; 81% approval; lots of things could have been better, yet it's good for a playthrough or two, but I would not pay top dollar; wait until it's $5-10 to pick it up.

												I've spent so many hours and days just loading and reloading sections of the game to see what happens differently if I make a different choice or action..... most of those reloads are actually resets.... all the way from Mass Effect 1....I dont regret a damn second of it. 10/6 bacons. We'll bang, ok?			",129,10,1,14,3,0,18

												Easily one of the best BIoware games of all time. If this was remastered i'd buy it in a hear beat. Top 3 of my all time favorite games. The replayability is immense. If you have never played it and wish to start, PLEASE PLAY MASS EFFECT 1. It adds so much game play to the second game and you can import your character, plus you feel so much more into the story. highly recommened game.			",65,0,1,4,1,0,1

												I rarely write reviews and much less serious reviews, but after everything they've given me, Bioware deserves something back. The Mass Effect series is amazing and Mass Effect 2 is Bioware's masterpiece. I've honestly lost count of how many times I've played through this game, but it's at least 11 (as of June 13, 2016) and I will continue to play it until I physically cannot do it anymore. Mass Effect 2 possesses the best characters, storyline, and gameplay out of any game I've ever played. On top of that, the soundtrack and graphics are no joke either. Mass effect 2 is a masterpiece in every sense so much so that I have a hard time writing a coherent review without leaving to go start the game myself. If you are having doubts about starting or continuing the series, then erase them and buy this (of course buy ME1 if you're starting.)10/10 best game in existence, changed my life			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Was incredibly surprised and pleased that EA didn't ruin a title for once and they did a fantastic job improving almost everything from controls to graphics. The story stayed just as good too.The downside being a very boring system of collecting resources and decisions not being too impactful.I still enjoyed just about every minute of playing this game (aside farming resources) and suggest this game despite it being an EA buy out.
