												Developed by Infinite Interactive and published by Namco Networks America, Puzzle Quest 2 is the sequel to the award winning Puzzle Quest: Challenge Of The Warlords. This title is a match 3 puzzle roleplaying game and certainly one of the best in the genre. Your chosen hero is tasked with reclaiming the once peaceful village of Veloren from the evil clutches of the demon Gorgon. Many fans claim that this title is not as heavy on the R.P.G. elements as the first game and that the story is just not as expansive as the first title and I would definitely agree. With that said, roleplaying elements are still present albeit slightly lighter in application. You pick from four different character classes and earn XP as you do battle across the outskirts of Veloren. As you level up, your earned XP will allow you to upgrade a number of abilities such as Strength, Agility, Intelligence, Stamina and Morale. Your character is also able to equip a number of weapons ranging from swords, axes, bows, etc. and even a flintlock pistol...one of my personal favorites I have to say. There is also a wide variety of armors, shields, spells and poisons at your disposal as well, however, some of these items are specific to the character class that you have chosen.Gameplay is quite similiar to that of Puzzle Quest: Challenge Of The Warlords so fans of that title will immediately feel at home. The goal is to match a set of three or more gems in order to earn mana and action points. Mana powers the equiped spells in your spellbook and action points allow you to attack with your chosen weapon or devices. At the conclusion of each battle a certain amount of gold and experience points are awarded as well as the possibility of loot. The puzzle battles in this game, in my opinion, are some of the best you can play in this genre. This title is extremely fun and addictive like these games typically tend to be. Some days you could log on and play a few quick battles for fun just to get your fix and other days you could find yourself playing for hours on end in one sitting. The story, while not as grand as the first title, is entertaining and makes you want to continue playing to the conclusion. Aside from the basic puzzle battles, there are also quite a few unique minigames to play where you can earn additional treasure and experience.Graphically, this game is the best looking match 3 puzzle R.P.G. available even better looking than Gyromancer in my opinion. Visually, it takes everything that Puzzle Quest did and just polishes it to perfection. The isometric game world is highly detailed. You will see lots of interesting things in the backgrounds of the many dungeons, castles and structures that you explore. The puzzle battlefields are gorgeous and vivid. The gems are beautifully animated and extremely detailed. The hand drawn character art and attack animations just look fantastic. Sound effects and music in this game are also implemented just as well. The score fits the fantasy theme of the title perfectly and does it job competently yet I have to say it's still not as great as the musical scores in Puzzle Quest and Puzzle Kingdoms. I actually downloaded those soundtracks and find myself listening to them quite often because they are just that great. The sound effects are crisp and hard hitting. When you make a match three, combo or cause a cascade of gems to drop you definitely know it. Also, when you use a melee, ranged weapon or a spell the sound effects are phenomenal. I particularly love the click click boom of my flintlock pistol...so awesome! A pistol in a fantasy game...don't even ask it's just awesome and you know it is.I've spent quite a few hours in this game and will continue to do so in the future because it's just so entertaining. Fans of match 3 or puzzle/R.P.G.'s should not be dissapointed in this title. It's definitely one of the better games of the genre and anyone looking to try one of these games for the first time should get either this or the much acclaimed Puzzle Quest: Challenge Of The Warlords. Game on!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you haven't already, play the first Puzzle Quest, where you battle warlords all across the lands, build your castle and tame ferocious beasts and gain their powers.Unless you prefer to battle hordes of rats after hordes of rats after hordes of rats in someone's damp basement, in which case this game is for you.The gameplay is of course much more polished and varied, but with the grand atmosphere of the first replaced with you being pest control, it becomes a grind with nothing to motivate whatsoever.

												Puzzle Quest 2 deviates in a good number of ways from its predecessor. Most notable are the changes to mana and that you now have a weapon. Overall I'd say it was a good change, as it doesn't feel like a recycled version of the first game at all, while still having the same basic gameplay.With the mana changes, it's harder to become godly, but it also feels like every level gain is a really tiny improvement. Heavily investing in one stat has diminishing returns (which is fine from a balance perspecive). Enemies scale up a bit faster than you do, and once dead they stay dead, so there's a strange sort of progression going on there since you can't grind forever.Similar to the first game, the encounter rate is through the roof. Fortunately you can skip a good number of encounters by simply ignoring the monsters. There's far less quests, but most of the quests in the first game were pretty pointless to begin with, so I guess this is can be seen as a good thing.Fortunately the mini-games are toned down and varied, and luckily opening treasures has no failure. So it's nice to have freebies every now and then to break up the monotony.The story, as best I can tell, bears no relation to the first game. Not that either one is special, anyhow.If you like Puzzle Quest 1, I'd say this is a worthy addition. If match-three games aren't your thing, this game won't do anything to appease that feeling. I'll give this an 8.			",535,252,19,112,46,6,135

												Coming after the complete mess that was Puzzle Quest: Galactrix, Puzzle Quest 2 returns to the tried-and-tested Puzzle Quest formula we know and love with some enhancements to the gameplay and a streamlined story/quest mode. It's a good game (I wouldn't have played it for as long as I did if it wasn't) but leaves some things to be desired.First things first: the game is *incredibly* slow compared to its predecessor, both in character movement on the map screen and within the gameplay itself. And whilst the story of the original didn't set any new records in originality, Puzzle Quest 2's story is both completely unrelated to the first and so boring that I just skipped it entirely. They have also stripped out large chunks of the sidegames in the first game (castle building, mount training, item creation, etc) and replaced them with laughably easy ""unlock doors"" and ""disarm traps"" minigames.The addition of the new weapon system makes things interesting, and opens up a new strategy to the game. But towards the end of the game I found this just made the game a cycle of building up weapon points, and unleashing them on the enemy - ending the fight within a few turns of doing so and reducing fights to a monotonous routine. The armor/blocking mechanic is also interesting at first, but to be honest it just makes the game slower.That all said though, it's still a good game. Three-in-a-row game mechanics are simple and addictive, and I don't feel that the time I spent playing the game was wasted, but I don't see myself replaying it any time soon due to its slow nature (compared to the first game that I completed at least five times.)If you like three-in-a-row games then you'll like this. But I would recommend the first Puzzle Quest a lot more than its sequel.			",277,36,3,28,10,0,32

Also there's no main base, which means no research, mounts, sieging, or crafting.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Takes the Puzzle Quest formula into Diablo-like dungeon crawling.  Started out addicting, but became really repetitive - too often fighting the same enemies over and over.  Not nearly as good as Puzzle Quest 1 or Puzzle Kingdoms, and doesn't hold a candle to Might & Magic Clash of Heroes.And, at least as the Assassin, it was too easy.  Switched to ""Hard"" difficulty shortly after starting to play, and almost never lost a battle.That said, there's still fun to be had here if, like me, you like the match-3/RPG genre.  6/10.

												Meh.  Alright game, but not as good as 1.PQ2 was very streamlined compared to PQ1, though not as streamlined as Marvel Puzzle Quest.  Compared to 1 there are neither elemental masteries nor elemental resistance.  Your weapon is now an activatable ability, which you use a new type of gem to activate.  The weapon becomes your primary form of damage.The fights are alright for the most part, except for the one or two times your weapon is replace by a very, very awful item that you have to use to kill a tough boss.  That fight ruined the game for me.The overworld isn't a map so much as it is an explorable world, but with that comes confusion and annoyance.  There are secrets to be found but they're not very well hidden, and the paths are almost always blocked by a beastie of some sort.  You know, except for when they aren't, so you go around the entire dungeon just to avoid one fight.  I don't recall if monsters respawn or not, but I believe that they do not.The entire experience was less enchanting than that of PQ1, but that doesn't mean this is a bad game.  It just doesn't live up to my expectations.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												O dear god. I got this game through a humble bundle, so it wasn't a waste of money. It started off fun, basicly it's a deeper version of Bejeweled  where matching colors gives you points that you can then use to activate certin skills in order to defeat your opponent.  Leveling up gives you access to new skills.  It was fun until about halfway through the game, where I kept thinking to myself ""I've gone this far, I might as well finish it."" But it just kept going.  Battle after battle. Fight after fight.  I rarely changed skills once I found an effective combo. Monsters rarely even posed a challenge, even towards the end, and the final boss was easily dispatched.  The ""combat"" just got so repetitive I was praying for the game to be over.  The odd thing was, once I beat the final boss, the game continued, as if I wanted the chance to go back and beat every single encounter that I may have missed.  No way.  I cant say this game is bad, but I can only recomend it if you REALLY like Bejeweled, and even then it's a chore.  It was suffering to ""beat"" it. No way in hell would I suffer through trying to get all of the achievments.  I didn't try online, so I cant say, but I doubt playing against a human would be much better.			",202,77,10,23,53,4,45

												Puzzle Quest 2 is incredibly tedious, stripping out any pretense of a story, so you just clear out floor after floor of mobs, with nothing to break up the monotony. They've removed all side activities, like conquering castles, taming mounts, crafting items. Instead of equipment conferring interesting abilities, all it does now is raise a generic Defense stat (except for the weapon, of course). You meet sidekick characters that are immediately forgotten the second they join your party and never speak again.Yes, they moderately improved the match-3 aspect by removing pointless gold and experience and replacing them with purple mana and action points, but that's literally the only improvement. Across the board, every other change they made is a detriment to the game. THE ART IS TERRIBLE.Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords is a much, much better game. It had a simple but fun fantasy plot, solid sidekick characters, a neat (if unbalanced) mix of equipment, and decent enough art. The match-3 gameplay honestly isn't that different between the two, so even if that's your focus, I still recommend the first game due to its much higher quality and variety.Puzzle Quest 2 is a bad game that wastes your time.

												(6/10)I am a huge fan of the original Puzzle Quest, having played through it back in the day on a nintendo hand-held.  That game was broken in some ways, but not in a bad way, more that if you were careful and managed things just right, you could eventually create an amazingly over-powered character that could 'lock down' the whole board and win by the first or second turn.Sure that made multiplayer pretty unmanagable, but for the single player game it actually gave a certain level of domination satisfaction of 'here is my incredibly over-powered end game character let me just splatter the fields of puzzle-battle with the remains of anyone foolish enough to challenge me'.I mention this because I guess having seen how over powered people could become in the first game, it seems like they made it a priority to 'fix' that in this second outing.  While the core gameplay survived intact, it seems like they have gone to great lengths to reduce the utility and natural meshing of the various skills and secondary mechanics to the point it honestly feels less like an RPG dressed in puzzle elements, and more like a basic match 3 game with some very light rpg traces sprinkled in.The 'overworld' is now quite limiting and slow.  While there are a number of options to go and do, they are often so removed and seperated that you will spend as much time wandering slowly from screen to screen as you will actually battling bad guys.  Additionally it feels like a number of the areas you 'could' possibly go are more or less artificially blocked by bad guys way higher level than you to the point that in the end there really is only one fairly linear line of progression along the enemies that won't just smash you routinely.Its not truly *bad* in that the core matching and fighting is ok, it just seems like here in the second outing, the overall rpg tone is honestly a net negative, not positive like it was the first time around.

VERDICT: Buy (8.5/10) Completion Time: ~30 HoursBottom Line: ""For RPG and Bejeweled fans, this game is excellent.""PROS+Addictive gameplay+Tons of quests+Beautiful worldCONS-Meh story-Gameplay MAY become repetitiveREVIEWStarting as just a lone traveler, your character stumbles upon a village, where after further investigation and goblin slayin' you are tasked with saving the realm from evil. I'll admit, it's not the most original story, but I didn't clock 40+ hours into this game for nothing. It's the addictive gameplay mechanics that kept me hanging around. This game is a combination of Bejeweld style puzzle matching and RPG. By matching certain gems, you fuel your character's abilities, deal damage to the enemy, or build strength for melee attacks. As your character levels up, you gain access to better weapons and better abilities. Figuring out a strategy against your foes is incredibly rewarding, and if certain spells are timed right, your character can quickly come a formidable opponent. Leveling up my character was a blast, and with each new dungeon came numerous new enemy types for me to test my skills.There are also tons of side quests to complete, given to you by the many village folk you come across on your travels. There is never a shortage of things to do. Also I cannot forget to mention that this game is gorgeous. The hand-drawn worlds and creatures are a sight to behold, and some of the bosses are unforgettable.The only negative is that once you nail down your strategy, gameplay can begin to feel repetitive. While I was constantly rewarded with new spells and weapons, I found early on that a single spell combination was the most effective for my character, which meant I was repeating the same tactics over and over, making things a bit mundane. This is why I encourage experimentation instead of taking the boring route like I did.For RPG and Bejeweled fans, this game is excellent. You get a ton of bang for your buck, and you will find yourself coming back time and time again.			",85,31,5,9,10,0,11

												The original Puzzle Quest felt novel with the idea of using a match 3 game to determine the outcome of an RPG battle. This is mostly more of the same. However I think it loses a bit by trying to go further in the RPG direction as that tends to add more time between match 3 games. And the story is pretty generic. It's a delicate balance.I'm a little on the fence here over whether to recommend the game as I grew bored and never finished it, but you might enjoy it if you haven't experienced this kind of game.

												This is a fun puzzle game, not the best out there but creative and good for wasting some time. But do not play this game to get invested in it because this game can simply be too frustrating. The game doesn't know how to make enemies strong enough so if it doesn't want you to beat them, you can't. It slates the board giving them continuous four of a kinds for up to almost a dozen times in a row, then leaving you with a board you can do almost nothing with. In a recent match I played there was a total of three turns each, there are normally at a very minimum, thirty or so, my opponent managed to drain 160 hp in just three moves(average damage is about seven per turn, if there is damage at all). If that's not frustrating I don't know what is. To sum, this game can be fun in short spurts, but overall I'd have to give it a 5/10.			",11,2,0,3,5,0,1

												Fun game. but one big problem. you will notice very soon than computer can make unbelievable combos. you Will get those feeling like computer is cheating or WTF is happening why this computer can still continue after 2 minutes and you are almost dead why computer can block and you not, even if you have 2 times biger block chance.  but still every battle is different even if it is the same opponent, somepoint you can't win him and next time you kick his♥♥♥♥♥so easy. but it is part of the game i think. but somepoint those thinks which i sayed earlyer will get under your skin :D			",313,100,24,46,20,7,44

												This is a fun puzzle game, not the best out there but creative and good for wasting some time. But do not play this game to get invested in it because this game can simply be too frustrating. The game doesn't know how to make enemies strong enough so if it doesn't want you to beat them, you can't. It slates the board giving them continuous four of a kinds for up to almost a dozen times in a row, then leaving you with a board you can do almost nothing with. In a recent match I played there was a total of three turns each, there are normally at a very minimum, thirty or so, my opponent managed to drain 160 hp in just three moves(average damage is about seven per turn, if there is damage at all). If that's not frustrating I don't know what is. To sum, this game can be fun in short spurts, but overall I'd have to give it a 5/10.			",11,2,0,3,5,0,1

												I am not recommending this game. Puzzle Quest 2 tries to improve on the very simplistic quest style of the original by adding new puzzle types, brief voiceovers, and a third-person mode. However, the new puzzles aren't much different or more fun than previously, and navigating between screens and NPCs is an awkward, bogged-down process that seriously slows down game progress.  I often find myself just waiting for the game to let me move ahead. In addition, the soundtrack is dull and lifeless so far.  Stick with the original!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Puzzle Quest is a cross between a JRPG and Bejeweled, with a minigame similar to the latter acting as a proxy for combat. As in Bejeweled, spaces on the board are cleared by forming rows of matching colors, and empty areas are filled with additional tiles that drop in from offscreen. If you're lucky, the gems that drop in will match adjacent gems and cause additional cascades of damage to your enemy; many people have observed that this ""luck"" seems to happen much more frequently in the computer-controlled opponent's favor than it does the player's. Scientists have demonstrated that many primates have an innate sense of fairness: if you give one monkey a greater reward than another received for the same task, they notice and become hostile. That being said, it's a given that nearly all artificial intelligence in video games cheats to some degree, since this is the easiest, most reliable way that a computer can present any sort of challenge to the human brain. Because of this sensitivity to unfairness we share with other primates, though, an important part of video game AI is not that it avoid cheating--which is extraordinarily difficult--but that it avoid the APPEARANCE of cheating. A single glimpse of obvious cheating by the computer is often enough to completely ruin a game forever. Puzzle Quest's developers claim that the game doesn't cheat, and more specifically that it doesn't know the makeup of the gems that will fall into the board after a move; I'm not convinced. What I am sure of, though, is that it FEELS like the computer is cheating, and it made the time I spent playing this game one of the most frustrating and least rewarding experiences of my life.

												Addictive blend of Bejeweled clone, turn-based strategy, and RPG elements. Tactical decision making is surprisingly deep given the wide array of spells per class. Itemization, while somewhat diverse, is a bit lacking and arguably meaningless at times. Similarly, on normal difficulty the game doesn't present too much of a challenge and the penalty for losing combat is a counter intuitive -- you actually gain experience points for a failed encounter. That said, the positives far outweigh the negatives and one play through will give you roughly 40ish hours of entertainment depending on the number of side quests completed.  Additionally the classes are distinct enough that you'll probably want to check all of them out potentially quadrupling your game time. There are also Endurance, Tournament, and an online Versus mode that yield even more replay value. A terrific bargain at the $10 list price and an absolute steal at any significant discount.

												Take it from sombody that logged over 40 hours in the original Puzzle Quest on his PSP twice. This game feels like it was made by an entirely different group of people that wanted to try their own ideas. The artwork looks like something from a flash game you'd find being advertised on Facebook. The music is medieval styled sure, but the music from the original was relaxing and memorable. This just sounds like ripoff Lord of the Rings fare. As for gameplay, maybe it's because I picked a terrible class and didn't know it, but these matches hardly feel fair. The biggest problem I have with the game is the amount of wait time. Animations take longer. Gems matching takes longer. Talking to people and accepting quests all forces you to wait until the text is completely off the screen before you can carry on. If you play the original Puzzle Quest, you'll see how much more waiting there is here. I'm sorry I can't go into more detail with my review. I simply don't have the will to invest in this game when in my heart, I know that the original Puzzle Quest is worlds better. In fact, I'm going to buy it now. Heres to a third 40 hour adventure!

												Puzzle Quest 2 is a ""match three game"" with an entertaining cartoon story.  In this second game you are helping the residents of a small town deal with orc invasions and attacks from monsters.  Along the way you uncover mysteries of the old buildings, and befriend allies who will trade with you and teach you spells.  Different opponents require different tactics and spells to beat,  as some opponents have abilities to regenerate or strike with large weapons which can decide the outcome of a game.  There are side activities where you bash or unpick locks and during these activities you can earn useful resources and new weapons and equipment.

												If you've played the first, this is nothing new.  If not, welcome to a hybrid of Match-3 gem-swapping and turn-based RPG gameplay.  You move gems on a board to match them, and these gems go to your mana pool to fuel your special attacks, or to use your weapon, as it doesn't merely boost the damage you do by matching skulls anymore.  There are a lot of monsters to fight, and there are a lot of quests to finish, and minigames will pop up requiring you to search a room, or disarm a trap, all with their own alterations to the typical rules.  If you like Bejeweled and its ilk, this game and its older brother may be fine for you, though the turn-based aspect and having to mind your stats and equipment and skills may be a bit much for people not used to RPGs.

												Match 3 at its best, with an amusing RPG wrapped around it. Enough of a twist on the simple match 3 mechanic with artifacts and spells and variation in the kinds of match 3 puzzles to keep it interesting and push it forwards with the story. A story that will take a while to go through (especially if you're like me and like doing the little side quests), as well as some tough challenge modes you can have a crack at. An enjoyable successor to the first puzzle quest and well worth the time.			",469,178,15,75,44,7,107

												A repetetive game, but a classic.The basis of the game is revolved around match-3 gameplay, with bonuses being given for matching 4 or 5 ""gems"" in a row. However, since you're versing someone, you can't really just score points for matching. Nope, you have to kill them! For that, you have a few methods. You can attack them with your weapon (which costs action points...which you also have to gather) you can match skulls (which are like gems...) or you can use spells. Essentially, some spells give other spells bonus damage, or your weapon, or whatever. You have to create combos with these attacks, and thus defeat your opponent. But remember, they are trying to do the same to you! It's a great mix of strategy, puzzling and questing down into dungeons. Great for a price, great for wasting time, just great in general.9/10			",287,25,2,31,28,5,47

												This is by far my favorite game in the Puzzle Quest series.  If you're looking for a change from the twitch gameplay of FPS and Action RPG games, this one offers a very chill experience.  The game is absolutely huge too, and there are no shortage of fights, treasures, and traps to discover.  The RPG elements are surprisingly deep for what is essentially a game of Bejeweled.  I really enjoyed the equipment and upgrade system, as well as the large amount of spells you can use for battles.  It sets up a surprising amount of strategy for battles.As great as this game is, there are also some issues, though nothing that ruins the experience.  The AI is pretty much infalliable, especially if you leave a 4 or 5 match on the board accidentally.  It will always match it, without fail.  Regardless of how good you are, you will sometimes miss these bonus matches - and the AI always makes you pay immediately.  Second, some of the fights seem to drag quite a bit later in the game.. some of the trash monsters seem to cling to life for quite some time.  They're still very easy fights, but it shouldn't take 15+ minutes for a glorious hero to take down a random skeleton.  (Though it should be noted that I play a templar, and they're not meant to be damage machines)  Lastly, the board seems to Mana Drain a little more often than it should.  I understand there's a very random aspect to this game, but the AI should be able to compensate for this when deciding what the next gems will be.  I've had some fights mana drain 3 or 4 times in a few minutes, and that really draws out the battles.  Again, these problems are very minor, and I would still give this game a 9/10.  It's simply great addictive fun.			",106,41,0,32,6,0,5

Matching gems earns mana of that color, which allows you to cast spells to damage your opponent, buff yourself, etc. You can also damage your enemy by matching skulls, or matching action gems that give you points you can spend when striking your weapon.

												Combining both the frustration of solving intricate puzzles, and the tediousness of grinding out quests, Puzzle Quest 2 is a true force to be reckoned with in the market for irritating, time-consuming games.Nah but seriously, it's not bad.			",147,35,3,21,33,0,31

												50 hours on a puzzle game Antipunk? Doesn't that seem a bit excessive? Not when it's an engrossing RPG like Puzzle Quest 2. Sure, there is a bit more grind than I would like, but this match-3 game will sink its hooks in deep. As well, the multiplayer will have you matching three and casting lightning bolts at your friends.			",645,134,16,68,39,6,77

												A very interesting take on the Match4 genre. I enjoyed it a lot for a good couple of hours, but in the end it just gets way too repetitive and the game isn't very good at throwing new and interesting things at you. Tried twice to complete it, but it just ends up being too boring in the end. But for the couple of hours that it's fun, I think it's worth a look.			",301,109,2,23,26,3,53

												I played the first puzzle quest on PC a long time ago and it seemed to be better than the second one. I also played puzzle quest on Nintendo DS and that version was amazing. However with Puzzle Quest 2, there was a lack in quality of game graphics and just the overall feel of the game was that of mediocre. I am dissappointed by Puzzle Quest 2. I wish that they had kept the good things from Puzzle Quest (1) and DS version and improved on those. Rather, 2 seems a step back.			",68,29,0,15,2,0,7

												this game SUCKS. enemies know where all gems will fall. so my move is a single move sometimes i match four, then when it comes their turn, all you ever do is line them up for a connecting 4, CONSTANTLY. in number one, the enemies still knew where the gems would fall, but there you got things to counter this, like mounts and got to craft your own weapons, here, it looks like a sad attempt at trying to make the game streamline, all it has done is make me miss the first one, and remind me why games shouldnt have a second part to them, honestly, save your money, or even better, buy the first one, cuz this one is JUNK! wish i could get a refund.

												I can't say many nice things about this game so i won't, What i will say is games like this one are why valve should change they'er refund policy on steam games, Now i never played puzzle quest 1 so i came in not knowing what to expect but willing to learn the game, What i learned was this game has one of the most cheep A**  A.I.'s i've ever seen, Nothing says bull chips like haveing the enemy start the match and then get free turn affter free turn ( sometimes up to 5 or more) while you eat damage and it gets almost half the mana it needs to cast it's more game ending spells, And if thats not bad enough alot of those spells are broken as hell, free turns, random effects that aren't random in the least, spells that can be spamed again and again in a single turn, And don't get me started on the blocking, i've done 100+ damage to an enemy only to have it knocked down to 25 and that's AFFTER i hit the game's level cap, And why oh why in the mid game are you sending me enemys so low level that i can't get EXP from them? If i had got this game from a store i would return it, get my 10$ back and spend it on something that would not make me hate my self or my laptop but i can't, i can only hope if puzzle quest 3 gets made those who make it learn the difference between challenging and cheep because baby this is CHEEP.

												If you are a fan of the genre, PQ2 is a welcome addition, however it is not as strong as PQ1 in my opinion. Firstly, avoid the iOS and Android version of this game; it has awful monetization requirements. Puzzle Quest 2 is much more dungeon-focused than its predecessor. While this still makes for a good game, it pales in comparison to the original Puzzle Quest. The maps are not as interesting and there certainly is not as much to do. The introduction of mini-games to determine quality and quantity of loot gets tedious; fast. The game looks just as polished as its predecessor. In this Puzzle Quest, you cannot have your own castle or ride mounts or capture enemies to learn their abilities. This definitely takes away from the replayability of the game. Being able to learn any ability from any enemy really added a level of depth that, when missing, makes PQ2 feel barren. Overall, this game is not bad, but I do feel the developers tried changing too much with their game and took it in a direction that is less welcoming to people who wish to replay it.

												I can't believe I put so many hours into this game. Guess it was addictive after all, even though the AI acted cheap sometimes. Like many other games this is a 'match' game where you have to match 3 or more of the same colors in order to damage your opponent. You can also used RPG like powers to inflict even more damage. It's pretty fun. The game uses a quest system and you can walk around but all quests have to be finished by puzzling. So there's no real variation. Along the way you can pick locks, open chests and disarm traps, so I guess there's a little variation after all. If you like RPGs and puzzle games you'll have a great time with this game.[Rating: 88/100]			",1661,635,69,221,194,16,225

												Definitely a 'Marmite game' this - you'll either love it or hate it. It follows the traditional 3+ gem matching process of many games in this genre. But whereas the Bejeweled series suffers from being a bit limited and repetitive, PQ2 has a lot more tactical and strategic choices to make. At the start - certainly sub-Level 10, you'll feel like the game is an impossible challenge to surpass - the AI mysteriously able to gain better gem drops and hammer you with spell and attack combos with seemingly little defence against them. And that's on Easy. However, stick with it and as your character starts to progress and develop - so do your in-battle options - making the challenge much more fun and enjoyable as a consequence.Those who had their fingers burnt with the frustratingly flawed Puzzle Quest Galactrix, can rejoice in this far superior game.

												This game is a mystery to me. It has the most basic game features around but has proven exceedingly entertaining, even addictive. It's a good deal, and fairly customizable in-game. I'd say go for this one.			",83,12,0,12,5,2,23

												The campaign story is not as entertaining or charming as the first game, but the combat is much more balanced (and still more fun than Galactrix's horrible system). Biggest change is the introduction of weapon-hand equips that require action points to use. Action points are obtained from matching the new action gems on the board. Lots of other puzzle mini-games to try out as well.Be sure to try out the multiplayer mode: this is the only PC-version Puzzle Quest title with reliable online play.			",206,51,3,28,10,3,46

												Rating Scale: Offensive Unfun Fair Good EnthusiasticPuzzle Quest 2 follows up on the original formula with a long Dungeon Delving Experience. Maybe a tad too long, as I felt I was done with the game before finishing it, and the leveling track, but maybe that's just me.Overall, you are playing a match 3 game, where events you complete build up power reserves that you use to deal damage to a NPC AI. The game sometimes feels like it's cheating, but overall the experience is fair. There are four classes to choose from, with a extensive ability list for each one, so you can customize your play experience to the style you like... although honestly, solving puzzles and dealing damage with weapons will probably get you just as far. If you want a more portable experience, this will do. If not, then you can get as much satisfaction playing the Marvel Puzzle Quest game.			",33,16,0,13,6,1,12

												Puzzle Quest 2 is an interesting take on the Bejeweled formula; adding an rpg style element to the mix. I do enjoy the game for what it is, but it does get a bit stale after the first few quests. The game basically becomes repetative dungeon crawling, where you roam from point A to B, forced to fight battles along the way. The fights themselves aren't very challenging and the only thing that seems to change is the increasing length of time for each battle, as the HP of everything increases as you level up.The game is a nice time killer but if you haven't played the first one, I would recommend that over this game as it actually poses a challenge.

												This is a novelty I picked up mostly thanks to the Extra Credits crew pointing it out in their ""Games You Might Not Have Tried"" series.I'm a sucker for match-3 types of games, I'll admit it. Add on an RPG system and this is the odd hybrid you get that I'd like to sit down and properly give a longer take on rather than just a few idle minutes fiddling around with how things work and being surprised at how actually very well the pieces all fit together.It's weird, but in the most fascinating ways. Certainly worth a look, at least.			",124,21,0,25,3,0,18

												Boy, how can game developers be this autistic?When I looked at the gameplay videos for this game, I said to myself, “Golly gee, this game isn’t just a fantasy point and click questing game, but it’s a puzzle game as well! I love both of those game genres, this will be quite an amazing buy!”Now don’t get me wrong, I still stand by the fact that the game concept is incredible. Don’t worry, I’m getting to the point.There are 4 classes to choose from. I created the Templar because he looked like a badass savage who gets the finest of poon on the reg. I set the difficulty to easy because I wanted to get a decent feel for the game before progressing to medium.So I’m playing, killing monsters by beating puzzles, getting nasty armor, and completing quests. At this point, I’m saying to myself, “Man, I am such a G for finding this game. I’m winning way too easily though, let’s turn this puppy up to medium”.Any normal human being would think that medium means “The computer makes more educated moves to beat the player”. Well not this autistic game. In this game, medium means “Every time gems drop after the player makes his move, we’ll make sure that the correct gems drop for the computer so that it can get as many combos as possible”. Also, whenever the game gives you a recommendation on which gems to move, it sets the computer up to do massive damage for you. I’ve tested this hypothesis by playing multiple games, which Is why I am confident in my conclusion that my original accusations are definitely true.So you must be thinking to yourself, “man, so you get $h1yt stomped on medium”? No, you still always win because you just have tons of health over all of the opponents. Hell, even all of the bosses that I have faced have had less health than me. If you’re going to rig the game, then at least FAHKIN beat me.This game could have had so much potential, but the developers just decided to have downs syndrome instead.Then again, maybe I’ve become enough of an adult to realize the unfairness in games such as this one. Maybe this is God telling me that it’s time to grow up.You know what? Maybe I should uninstall steam and focus on getting my life together. I have a textbook on MySQL that I should be studying. I should be paying attention to my girlfriend. Who knows, she could potentially be my wife someday. You know, I should really be spending quality time with my parents. I mean, they won’t be around forever.Man, Puzzle Quest 2 has really made me analyze what my priorities should be in this world. Maybe Puzzle Quest 2 was the best buy of my entire life for granting me this revelation.			",237,26,3,64,13,1,42

												The Good: Puzzle game play is still addictive, RPG elements add depth, lots of missions, mini-games are funThe Bad: Stupid story, generic characters, unbalanced difficulty, the charm is just goneThe first Puzzle Quest was amazing and it just had a lot of charm, a great story, good characters, and there was just something magical about that game. Puzzle Quest 2 is a disappointment. The core game play is still intact, but it's repetitive, has a toss away story, and just lacks the charm of the first game.You play as a generic character who is trying to free the town from the evil Orcs and Goblins and what not and it's not very interesting at all. The first game had a nice overhead map you moved around on, but you walk around with stiff two frame animations and it's not as appealing as the first game. Even the dialog is uninteresting and just feels like unnecessary filler.The puzzle part is the best part of the game and it's still the same. You can use you weapon to attack but you must get the fist gems and reach the amount the attack requires. There are different colored gems and matching three adds to the amount the magic spell requires. Getting four-of-a-kind grants you another turn, and five-of-a-kind as well but lands a wild card. Skulls are used to attack the enemy, and there's great depth and strategy involved and it's highly addictive still. Trying to find the right combination of spells will make you unstoppable, but there isn't a huge selection and unlocking the spells can take forever.You can level up (thus the RPG elements), but it never feels like it does much because of how unbalanced the game is. You'll have a regular foe with 184 HP then a boss with only 72. It's weird, but you keep coming back for the addictive puzzling. Another downfall is there's hardly any useful items in the game. Finding stronger armor, weapons, and shields should increase in quality as you progress, but half way through the game you're still finding stuff form the beginning. There isn't a large variety either and using mana potions and health potions is almost useless since just playing through the puzzle board is good enough.There are some new ideas thrown in such as ""mini-games"" these vary from looting treasure, picking locks, breaking down doors etc. Looting is really fun since there are only four types of symbols. Getting treasure is fun since you can drop matches so many times and matching rare chests gives you ""rare"" items, but they don't seem rare at all. Breaking down doors requires you to match door icons, picking locks seems a bit over complicated and I could never figure it out, but they are a nice touchDespite the charm being gone Puzzle Quest 2 manages to be good only by the puzzle game it was created from, but even hours into the game you will get sick of it, and may not even finish the story. The game just feels half baked and I know it could have been so much better. However, if you loved the first game, or just love puzzle games, this is a great game for anyone.~Score: 8/10			",240,30,8,29,14,2,22

												I'm still in the middle of the quests at this point, and haven't really unlocked any other special modes.  I've logged around 95 battles so far, and have won a fair amount of them.If you enjoyed the first Puzzle Quest, you should like this one----however, as it's been several years since I played the first one and don't have a copy of it available at the moment, I can't draw any conclusions about what has been changed majorly since the first one.  I do know that right now I don't have any capability to upgrade a castle or keep; instead, I am upgrading weapons and armor that I have earned from killing enemies.There are a few new game modes and puzzles, like breaking open doors by picking locks, or using magic (both of these have their own separate mini-game mode for this,) and there's also random treasure chests scattered about the maps you explore where you play a loot mini-game to achieve rare, fine, and sometimes masterwork items.  The luckier you are or the better you do, the greater the odds of finding more rare equipment, armor, and mana potions.If you're new to the series, Puzzle Quest is essentially a match-three game with RPG elements.  You have a pool of mana, consisting of five types......red, blue, green, yellow, and purple.  Each of these is arranged on a grid (it may be 8X8 or 9X9, some board sizes change in the game.)  You just have to match 3 of any color to add it to your mana pool.  As you progressively make more and more matches, your reserves will build up, which will allow you to cast a spell against the enemy, which may do direct damage, stun them for a few turns so they can't act, increase your own defense, and many more.  Each enemy you run into has its own strengths and weaknesses and its own HP gauge.  You do as well.  Be mindful of the abilities you have and use your strengths to your advantage.  There are also skulls on the board which can be matched---and these do direct damage to your enemy.  Match four of anything in a row and you'll get a free turn, and this effect can be stacked.  Match five in a row and you will get a *wildcard* which allows you to match anything else on the board with it.  Gloves are also placed on the board as Action Tiles which increase your Action Reserve Points so you can use your equipped weapon on an enemy. Each weapon has an action cost and a damage amount---and each of these weapons do differing amounts of damage and also sometimes other status enhancements.You'll have the ability to upgrade your weapons and armor at the Armorsmith, but I've honestly not had to do that too often, since I seem to have better luck finding stronger weapons in treasure chest mini-games.The graphics and sound in the game are average, and there are some nice effects that play across your screen anime-style when you choose to attack with your weapon, and when the enemy does too.You'll run into various enemy types, including Goblins, Orcs, Witches, Berzerkers, Shaman, Skeletons and Ghosts.  Boss battles are also included.In addition to playing the main quest, you also have the option to do side-quests, which can really help you earn extra XP, gold, and other goodies.I finished the first PQ, and fully intend to see this one to completion as well.  If you like match-three games and RPG games, you really can't go wrong with this one.  It's easy to pick up and learn, and is well worth the money spent considering the time it will take to progress through the game.			",5,9,0,4,5,0,1

There are times when it seems ridiculously unfair even when you seem to be winning a battle. Lets say that you go forth to challenge the Yeti for example...you will utterly be annihilated because you literally don't have a prayer against it until you level way up. So you will have to come back to it since it's in the beginning of the game. This is pretty common throughout the game with other enemies as well. There are even ones that steal all of your life points before you can scream ""I hate this game!"". It seems grossly unfair pretty much all the time, but it is still for whatever reason an appealing game that is if you enjoy mental self-abuse. On the plus side the music is great, the effects and spells are pretty cool, as is the artwork. But...so frustrating ",215,42,0,30,10,1,13
