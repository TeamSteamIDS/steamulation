												Kid writes a review, and isn't too sure what to say. Ten outa ten, best game of the year, or a fine work of art, words of praise that's hollow with no real meaning. You could say this kid wants to write about the solid gameplay, engaging story, beautiful world, amazing soundtrack, and a fine narration. But the kid knows better... The game left him feeling satisfied in the end, no one can say he had a bad time. But all phrases and words just don't cut it for the kid, so he'll leave it like this, Bastion made him happy like a Scumbag with a full stomach.			",104,35,0,12,6,0,10

Bastion: where gaming meets geniusWhen Supergiant Games released Bastion in August 2011, probably they themselves probably won't have dreamt of the enormous critical acclaim their debut title would get. Seldom has an independent developer hit the gaming scene with such an original and beautiful game as in this case.When I started Bastion for the first time, I immediately got the feeling I was in for a special treat. Few games begins as arrestingly as this one, with the whiskey- and smoke-weathered voice of the ""narrator"" immediately setting the scene. This narrative aspect proved crucial in the way Bastion drawed me into its world. It seemed like every step I made or every action I tried, could be met with some commentary. This feeling that the story develops ""on the spot"" is further enhanced by the fact that the world literally materialised under my feet as I ventured further out. This world is painted in bright and gorgeous colours with a teint all of their own: Bastion would be immediately recognizable just by looking at the colour-pallette.The story by itself proved interesting enough to keep me playing, wanting to discover step-by-step how things would develop with the Bastion and the protagonists. Gameplay-wise, Bastion is not as innovative as in its storytelling or visuals, but it takes a well-tried formula into perfection. At its core, it is an action-rpg (light), preferably to be played with an xbox 360 controller (as are so many games the past years!). Controls are perfectly laid out and very intuitive: after a couple of hours I played it as if I had done so for several years. As the game progresses, more weapons and special abilities are unlocked, all with their distinctive characteristics. Weapons can be upgraded in five stages each, and liquids add some punch to the main-characters possibilities. Several other elements complement this core gameplay so that there is always enough variety to keep things interested. I even signed up immediately for the ""new game plus"" mode after completing the game a first time, looking forward to more unlocks of different sorts.Another department where Bastion truly shines, is its soudtrack. Seldom has ingame-music helped me so much in getting ""into"" the game, as it captures the mood of every level to perfection. Combined with the unique grain of the narrator's voice, this develops into a great listening experience. The developers also did a wonderful jobs in the myriad of smaller sounds present in the game: every weapon for example has a unique ""ring"" to it, from the zippy sound of the Breaker's Bow to the rusty clack of the Musket. There really is no weak link in this game. Everything is extremely well thought-off, and even better implemented. It's a must-play for everyone who loves pc gaming.Gameplay: 27/30Graphics: 18/20Sound: 10/10 (maybe the best of all elements in this game)Longelivety: 8/10 (I played it for over 25 hours, exploring it to the full)Technical: 10/10 (no issues whatsoever)Steam-integration: 8/10 (trading cards, leaderbords and achievements included, the latter good but not special)Personal appreciation: 9/10Overall: 90/100I completely love Bastion and recommend it emphatically. Since I started writing reviews of the games I play on Steam almost a year ago, this is the first game that gets a score in the 90's - I don't want to ruin my scoring-system with giving too many high-scores. But this one deserves it to the full.			",290,156,5,32,35,4,67

""Kid just rages for a while"" ~The StrangerBastion should be counted among those few games that not only meet, buy even exceed all the promises we get in their early description. Being one of the most beautiful and climatic games of 2011 this action RPG shines brightly even now, still as fresh and original as during its release.The game itself is not so complicated. You take up role of a Kid, waking up, all alone, surrounded by beautiful yet crumbling world falling apart into thousand pieces. What You need to do is get to the Bastion – safe heaven set up to shelter those who’d survive any crisis threatening Your homeland – city of Caelondia.To Your aid, in a quest to find, and rebuild Bastion, You’ll get a vast arsenal of even the weirdest weapons, each coming with different mechanics and “special skills” which further enhance Your possible combat strategies. Further modifications to Your play-style can be achieved through quite original system of upgradable structures built inside the Bastion, which allow Kid to chose worshiped “gods” in a shrine, or special drinks in a distillery each differently affecting game environment, providing new opportunities or threats.Despite game mechanics being pretty simple it’s not easy to get bored with ‘Bastion’ even after a few long hours, but what really makes this game stand out is its unique way of telling the story. Most of our actions are commented actively by omniscient narrator, who not only slowly reveals some details behind tragic events that left the whole world in ruins, but also perfectly portraits the Kid and his few friends, allowing us to immerse into the games plot on a level rarely seen in video games.The last thing worth mentioning about ‘Bastion’ is it’s astonishing soundtrack. Composed by Darren Korb this game’s music fits its dreamy, hand-drawn canvas perfectly, strongly enhancing the impact of the narrative.Overall, I consider this game to be one of the most amazing feats of storytelling in video games, and definitely one of my favorites. And don’t get scared that the game relying so heavy on its story will get boring after just one completion. NG+ and Score Attack modes, matched which some arena-styled levels will allow You to spend long hours in “Bastion's” captivating world !Pros:- One of the most beautiful soundtracks out there.- Light, yet interesting story with uniqe responsive narration.- Vast amount of weapons, special skills and other modifications.- High replayability with NG+ and Score Attack.Cons:- To some, controls may feel a little unresponsive (I base on some friends opinions)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bastion is an amazing game, filled with colorful art and a sexy narration that tells the story as you play as oppose to ripping the camera and controls from you so you can watch a 5 minute cut scene. I would love to play another game with this guy as a lead voice. Music for the game is also very good and fitting for this kind of game, somewhat somber at times.The game play is pretty fast pace and excellent, though has it's short falls. One of them is that you are given too many weapons, Unless you plan on experimenting with the weapon load-out, You will usually stick with what works for you. Same with secret skills, which I hardly ever used while playing. Overall, an amazing game that opens up for you the more you play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Imagine a function that everyone's invited to. It's all over social media and touted as the biggest event of the year.  You plan on going because all your friends and colleagues intend to, but days pass and you forget to RSVP. Your calendar stops functioning and you lose sight of all your big appointments. You press on regardless, making sure everything's ready prior to the big day as you frantically search for your invitation. Time goes by and you get distracted, forgetting about your plans and your schedule. You finally locate your invitation and head to the venue, only to find a fish and chip shop where a reception should be, and that the big event was held three years ago. That's how late I am to this party. Released in 2011, Bastion is a game that belies its indie origins, combining great gameplay with colourful art and an amazing soundtrack composed by Darren Korb, making for a complete package that puts some bug-ridden AAA games to shame. The haunting song that plays during the closing credits, Setting Sail, Coming Home, will likely remain in your head for days, along with the urge to keep playing. Bastion is a lot of fun and I can't recommend it enough. If, like me, the game has been languishing in your ""to-play"" list for a while, waste no more time. Play it now. You won't regret it.

												I waited to write this review until I had beaten the game and got all of the achievements. I didn't really expect much from this game. I'm not really into these action, kiddy looking, RPGs. I kind of just picked it at random from where it had been collecting dust in my library, but it won my heart. The voice acting is amazing and clever. Arguably, there is a deep philosophical lesson to this game. I won't give it away though. The music? Wow. I have never wanted to buy a game soundtrack, but I do now! At some point in the game, you get a radio, with which you can put whatever song you like on from the soundtrack.  The game has different endings. You beat the game once, and have the option to play the game again with all of your weapons, upgrades, and level intact. This is helpful to get a different ending and/or for achievements. There is also a attack score mode, where you restart from the beginning, without your upgrades and from level one. In this mode, you can accumulate points and compete on the leaderboards. There are some really tough achievements, but once you get them you have this huge feeling of accomplishment. They really test your skills as a player. Buy this game. If you are on the fence, put it on your wishlist, and buy it when it goes on sale. I seriously doubt that you will be disappointed.

												Rarely does artistic excellence and mechanical brilliance come together in as amazing an experience as Supergiant's Bastion. Its vision is remarkably strong and merciless in its attempts to astound your expectations, never content to settle for anything less than wholly inspired. It stands apart as a shiny example of independent ingenuity, a bar to which others should aspire to hit, but more than that it manages to feel as fresh and fully developed as anything coming out of much larger studios. It's the sort of experience that sticks with you after you finish it, hollowing out a place in your mind where the most excellent games of our time take up residence, sure to be talked about for years to come.A proper story's supposed to start at the beginning, but Bastion's not that simple. It spins its narrative in a nonlinear spiral, urged on by the smooth voice of the narrator, who describes your character's every action with a cool and calculated tone that gives the impression he knows more than he's letting on and has seen this all before. More than just a original storytelling device, it gives Bastion a personality all its own from the second the game begins. It keeps you engrossed despite an almost complete lack of character dialog, falling back largely to third person descriptions that on their own may seem meaningless, but when weaved in perfect context to the action on screen create something of a living story; one which feels as much a product of your own actions as the author's. The plot is never neglected however, as slowly but surely it all winds back together, taking control over the fascinating amounts of lore you are told throughout your journey and turning them into a full featured narrative that never falters or shows any sign of hesitation. Its deliberate planning can be traced back to the very first line uttered in the game, and when you finally see it all fleshed out, it's rather incredible that it works anywhere near as well as it does.Bastion operates under a clear design to offer the player as much freedom as possible to choose their own playstyle. Almost entirely focused on hack'n'slash combat, it presents new weapons and means to dispose of your enemies on a near constant basis. Mixing and matching these weapons and abilities is what allows you to tailor the game to your own playstyle, from melee and ranged weapons, to a near endless variety of passive upgrades and power ups. Whatever you choose you're never locked into any one upgrade path, which lets you freely experiment to find what works best for you. The combat itself is extremely simple, but meticulously balanced and refined to feel satisfying and as challenging as you want to make it. It excels at creating a constant feeling of progression, even past the point of finishing the game as you can then playthrough it again in new game plus mode to catch any upgrades you missed, or take on even bigger challenges.This almost doesn't matter though, in the face of Bastion's astonishing presentation. The flow of tiles building the path in front of you venture through the world, the gorgeous art design that overflows with vibrancy and creativity, and the unbelievable soundtrack that blends an astonishing amount of styles into a sound that's unlike anything I've ever heard. It's truly an artistic feat that puts the bland and predicable visual and sound designs of other games to shame, and should serve as a reminder to developers that conforming to a common mold is detrimental not only to your games identity, but the industry as a whole. I can scarcely recall playing a game with as much aesthetic originality and finesse as Bastion, and it's a triumph to its creators that they were able to create something that is as impressive to look and listen to as it is to play.Even before I played it, Bastion always stood as something of a posterchild to me for indie games. Its relentless ambition and startling success at achieving it are a showcase of how much can be accomplished by a small team with a clear set of ideas for the game they want to make. It's stunning and memorable in the way few games could ever hope for, and is as mechanically solid as it is breathtakingly presented. It succeeds in every aspect, and is one of the most well rounded games I have likely ever played.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com]. ",845,336,29,79,65,6,112

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Bastion Original Release: 2011 Genre Tags: RPG; Action; Atmospheric; Isometric  My Overall Grade: A+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 5-11 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseurs REVIEWBastion is a very soulful game. That’s probably its most defining feature.  It's in the style of an isometric hack-and-slash, drawing from arcade roots and presented with a poignant atmosphere.  It is definitely a very easy game to enjoy; and it should appeal to wide variety of gamers.  And since it is medium length and has a wide range of difficulty options, it is a good game for anyone who may want to take a step out of their comfort zone and try something different.Probably the first thing that jumps out about Bastion is the gorgeous, hand-painted artwork. But that only scratches the surface.  The whole atmosphere of this game is incredible.  The world literally unfolds around you as you make your way through the environments. The soundscape is spot on and the music is great. It is a very aesthetic experience.The gameplay is strongly narrative-based.  In fact, there is an actual narrator that guides you through the game.  This nature of the game does lead it to be semi-linear, although you do have a fair amount of branching options to work with in some aspects of the game. The gameplay is pretty simple and intuitive, but also offers a surprising amount of depth.  There is a decent variety to your arsenal and to the enemies you face.  And the baseline difficulty is very easy, which is the proper way to design games so that everyone can enjoy them.  Nevertheless, the innovative difficulty system in the game allows you to tweak various specific options (enemy health, enemy damage, player movement, etc.) to meet your preference and tackle the most extreme challenges/achievements.Now the game isn’t really that long if you were to only do a single playthrough of the campaign. However, there are the aforementioned challenges and achievements to tackle, a NewGame+ Mode, and also an Score Attack Mode where you get a running score throughout your playthrough and can compete on leaderboards, if that is your thing.  So you should be able to get a good amount of playtime.So, in summary, I would say that the synergy of the soulful presentation, the intuitive gameplay, and the unique narration makes this game more charming than a Disney prince.  Bastion is a great gaming experience, and a modern classic.  Unless you are adamantly not interested in this genre, I recommend you at least consider giving it a shot.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bastion might not be something to get a ton of hours out of or regularly play, but its one of the most original RPGs. It really didn't feel bland at all. The game's simple, but very fun to play. Its good to get into if you don't want to learn a complex system or devote a bunch of time into going through an RPG. Its not a long game, but that doesn't make it lesser. There's some replayability to it with different modes too.Bastion's strongest point is the story. Oh my God its so good! A bit depressing, but so strong. It had a great impact on me and is easily a game that will never be forgotten.I won't speak much on it. You have to play through it for yourself.Also, the story is narrated. Its pretty neat and really sets the mood of the game. I couldn't imagine playing the game without the narration!The art is gooorgeous. It has a very artsy look and is quite colourful. Its pleasing to look at. I liked it a lot.The music is also excellent. Has an OST worth playing outside of the game. The style of music was pretty unique. Some really great tracks and its something I still listen to here and there.There's a few different ways to play the game when it comes to controls. It all runs very well. No issues.Bastion is just a total masterpiece. If you haven't played it you need to. Its one of those must-play indie titles that people will still be talking about years from now. Kind of the FF7 of indie games :)			",527,112,15,50,38,2,73

You don't need to be an alcoholic to enjoy the game, because in the process you'll end up drunk with it.

Mix them however you want to cover your weaknesses or boost your strengths.- For the hardcore master race you have things like Idols, which you can activate to make the game harder and increase your XP gain.

												Full of cryptic one-liners and bluesy-folk music, Bastion almost seems more like an art house project than a game at first glance. Rest assured though, with it’s stylish isometric graphics and stunning presentation, Supergiant Games has created something that not only brings a certain amount of legitimacy to indie titles, but in my honest opinion pushes the established medium of video games forward as whole. I would argue that Bastion is one of the biggest arguments for games as an art form to date.But how does one review or explain art? Everyone has their own interpretation. It is pretty easy to notice Bastion’s graphics, any screenshot is a testament to how gorgeous the game looks. But Bastion is not just a pretty picture; this is one game where you can not ignore the audio. There is a reactive narrator the explains everything as if he is watching you play. Fall off a cliff and he tells you to watch your step, get a new weapon and he is sure to have a little quip about it. Both the narrator and the game’s haunting music added greatly to the atmosphere and storytelling.Not content to rest on style alone, Bastion is also a solid action RPG. You assume the role of The Kid, who is never named. You awake to empty space, an existence that has been destroyed by an event known as the Calamity. As you take your first steps into this brave new world, life springs up under your feet and upon arriving to a safe haven dubbed the Bastion, you learn that it is your destiny to rebuild. Cores brought from the Wilds beyond the safety of the walls allow you to construct buildings: a forge for upgrading weapons, a shrine for paying patronage to the gods, or even a distillery for mixing your own drinks.Without giving too much away, the Kid comes to find out what caused the Calamity; the story is not entirely complex but rather poetic and touching. There are multiple different endings and a score attack mode to keep you playing long after the credits roll. And since the new game plus allows you to keep levels and weapons, I found it worth it to play through a few times in order to see everything. In short, I would say Bastion is pretty much perfection.			",329,87,8,57,21,4,47

												Visually flawless, poetic, philosophical and striking on many points: the musics, the songs (both bitter and nostalgic, and that haunt you for a long time...), the storyline,... A lovely RPG that reminded me of the good old Terranigma. Only cons I could find out, which is also something I loved is the narration. Don't misunderstand; it's gorgeous, and the way it's describing your moves with a bit of irony is very enjoyable. The problem is for non-native english speaker, like me, who might have troubles to concentrate on the subtitles while playing. That's the only negative point I could find while playing. Otherwise, don't hesitate! This game is a gem.-------------------------------------------------------------------Visuellement sans fautes, poétique, philosophique et surprenant sur de nombreux points: les musiques, les chansons (à la fois douces amères et nostalgiques, et qui vous hanteront pour longtemps...), l'histoire,... Voilà un sympathique petit RPG qui m'a à plusieurs reprises rappelé le bon vieux Terranigma. Seul défaut que j'ai pu lui trouver, qui m'a pourtant charmée, est la narration. Ne vous méprenez pas; cette narration est géniale, et la façon dont chacunes de vos actions est décrite avec une touche d'ironie est très appréciable. Le problème est qu'étant en vost, les joueurs dont l'anglais n'est pas la langue maternelle, même malgré un bon niveau, auront certainement du mal à se concentrer sur les sous-titres tout en jouant. Voilà donc le seul défaut que j'ai pu relever en jouant. Cela mis de côté, n'hésitez pas un instant! Ce jeu est une petite perle.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Most of you must have played it already. I will try to keep it short.Anyways,Bastion is a wonderful game. In the first few minutes, it pulls you in like quicksand with its watercolored art and ""what the hell happened here"" curiosity and its hard to quit playing after that. I guarantee that you will only quit playing either a) Your eyes start hurting real bad, b) You need to get out of that chair and do something.(^Its mostly gonna be 'a'^).Lets break it Down:++Fantastic Storytelling: Logan Cunningham does a fantastic job in narrating and guiding the player through the world of Bastion and at the same time, keep it alive. The Dyanmic commentry presented here is something i wish all games had. It just makes the game feel more Alive. It has lore, but only essential to the game.Yes he's also in Transistor. +++++The GAMEPLAY : OH YEAH, Fluid combat system and varied enemies keeps things interesting throughout the whole game. The melee and ranged weapons are well balanced and its upto to the player to figure out the what weapon loadout(2 melee or 2 ranged or melee-ranged) to take that bests suits one's playstyle. This i liked very much. Made me spend time experimenting with the different weapons, secret skills, passive boosts(spirits) and finding that right loadout for me. I also loved that we'd fall off the edges,keeps you more aware and cautious rather than just running around crazy. The level loading was also something eye-catching as it loads as you move or progress in-game,land just literally falling from the sky.++++The Amazing Art : The game was quite colorful with the watercolor backdrops and vistas, NPC designs were nice,and art was overall very appealing for 2.5D game.If you notice closely, you can see the different animation details for a lot of combat moves.++++The Sound: The sound sometimes really set the mood for whats happening in-game. Its amazing, maybe you wont feel its amazing just by listening to the tracks alone, but when in-game, they really bloom emotions. Yes, same sound team in Transistor..++ Overall: 10/10. Coz its one of those few games that made be Start NG+ difficulty. If you have it in your library and have'nt played it yet, I recommend YOU GO PLAY IT.One of the more powerful games emotionally for me. Its not ""Just"" another Indie Game.A brilliant marriage of story and mechanics. Waaay more Depth than Transistor.Spoiler Alert:The whole sequence of carrying Zulf just tugged on my heartstrings.

												Bastion 2012	When Bastion came out it was at the beginning of the Indie craze. People were first starting to realize that amazingly fun games could come from tiny studios with no budget. Well now in 2017 the term Indie game has all but lost its meaning both financially, and terms of team size. But at the time, a game with such deep combat, definitive flavor, and overall polish was a treat.	Bastion does a good job of grabbing you with the colorful paint-style world that appears beneath your feet as you move forward. Every action you do is narrated by a grandfatherly voice that explains the story and smaller moments. There was a time early in the game when I walked off the edge of the platforms and the narrator said “And that’s the end of the Kid’s story….I’m just kidding.” And I respawn and he says “The kid goes back for another round.” It was a charming break of the 3rd wall.	In addition to the narrator bringing the game to life, the music does a great job at capturing the alternate cartoon universe. A mix of western and oriental guitar give everything a nostalgic feel. One song was catchy enough that I was humming it even without thinking of the game. Usually music with lyrics and guitar seem out of place in games, but these just add to the feeling of the world. 	The funny part is that this isn’t even the good part of the game. Even the story, which is surprisingly deep and touches on serious themes such as racism, genocide, and war, is merely window dressing. No, the real meat of the game is in the amazing combat. It is fluid and intuitive, and each enemy that has a unique way it needs to be defeated. There are a dozen or so weapons that are upgradeable and each has it’s own strengths and weaknesses against certain monsters. Defending and dodge-rolling are a must and it keeps combat fast even on the defensive. Tuck and roll, tuck and roll. 	To really get the most out of this combat there is a mode where you take on waves of enemies for cash. This puts you in one square area against different types of enemies from through the story. On top of this add the difficulty modifiers. There are 10 Gods that can be invoked, each adding 10% gold 10% exp and some added challenge, ranging from increased enemy speed, to regenerating health. You can mix and match which hard modes you want to do, and you learn to adapt to them over time.	My first play though I mashed my way though the story without any hard modes and while it was fun it was closer an experience to diablo, every enemy was cannon fodder, I never had to defend, and every weapon felt overly powerful in my hands. It was fun and I was creating the base ground in which I would really enjoy the game. Once I turned on about half the added difficulties the game came into full form. The feeling of dodging each enemy, memorizing the enemy types and being able t keep track of all the enemies on screen at a time. It tapped into that zone where your not thinking you are just acting and it is beautiful and massively fun. It never feels cheap because you know the enemy types well enough that it is your fault for not blocking.	Over all it is a fun game that presents itself excellently and I can see why this game was so important in defining what an “indie game” during the time when that was starting to mean real quality games from unknown studios. For someone who plays the game for a short period it feels complete, and for someone who sticks around longer it has more under it surface. In that way it feels like a proof of concept for indie games; Presented well, deep combat, unique art style, and some attempt at story. But unfortunately it proves what can be done and then leaves it at that. Give it a whirl, it only has so much to give, but what it gives is memorable. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

After you wake up, you do as supposed after a disaster and head to the Bastion, there, you find out the Bastion needs cores to work as intended and you are sent to explore what remains of the world in search of these. During your joruney, you'll face countless enemies, explore land no one has set foot on before, you'll also know more about the Calamity and when the time comes...

Kid sits down. He writes a review for Bastion, one of many. Maybe someone that survived can read it. Someone sharper than a brusher's pike.... Or maybe someone as curious as a squirt.Bastion is an amazing singleplayer experience that provides an exceptional story and impressive artistic design, with simple, but effective combat mechanics, amplified by it's interesting soundtrack. It was released in 2012.Bastion is recieved high praise for it's story, which is told through a narrator. This form of storytelling was a new form of interactive media. In Bastion, a man narrates the actions of the protagonist, while also engaging the players in the lore of the world. This dialogue is vast, and there is a lot of narration throughout the game, which reveals the world to the players in an interesting and unique way. The interactivity can be seen when players simply play the game, which makes the game stand out. For example, if you flawlessly continue through a level, or if you defeat an enemy with a new weapon you found, or if you fell off a new level, you would get a unique piece of dialogue, adding to the theme of the game. There are hundreds of these conditional dialogue pieces, and even players that make mistakes can hear some unique dialogue as well, intensifying the bond between gameplay and narrative. Through this kind of narrative, players can learn about the world just by playing the game. Another example is the shrine. When you activate a god's shrine, it gives a short, but enticing, bit of dialogue that reveals a little bit more of the god to you. There's even a lot of text to go through, and lots of interesting descriptions to read about items that you find or use, and you are guaranteed to hear many different things by the time the game is complete. Another example of this narrative interactivity is even seen when picking weapons, as the narrator will make comments about the choice of weapons you have. Like if you pick a mortar and pike, or a mortar and carbine. Even the soundtrack is part of the story, as some music within the game actually is relevent to the game. On top of that, the soundtrack is quite good. The player also gets a little bit of choice through the story, as they can choose any weapon they have unlocked, activate any god to increase the difficulty, and there is an interesting moment where the player decides something. It's a post-apocalyptic world that feels like an adventure, yet there are moments where the player may learn about the sadder things in the world, as the game firmly grasps emotion, something that many games fail to do.Bastion isn't a complex game. It has relatively simple controls, however, this doesn't mean the game is boring, by any stretch, as there are a good selection of different weapons, and players get the option to make the game more difficult. Players can also use 'drinks', which are passive effects that the player can choose to make them even stronger. Weapons are handed to the player as the game progresses, widening the level of choice players get as they move towards the end of the game, and players can also select upgrades for their weapons, and can choose which upgrades they want. For example, a player may opt for damage, or they may opt for more range. The combat itself is relatively enjoyable. Players can roll, use a shield to block and counterattack, use range or melee attacks, and pick from a variety of special abilities, and, as mentioned before, the game's difficulty can be increased for more fun, possibly making the game faster paced. The game is very easy to get into, which makes it a great choice for casual players, or people who don't have much time to begin with, as they won't have to deal with an unforgiving learning curve.Bastion also has a very unique artistic style. It's a 2.5D game with great looking style throughout the entire game. There isn't a moment in the game that feels like it doesn't carry the theme of the rest of the game, and visually, it's easy to see that as players stroll through the menus, look at the loading screen, and explore the levels. Instead of the standard 3D world that you just walk around, Bastion's world is floating. Though there isn't really any platforming, it's a unique way to define current nature of the world, as it does become part of the game and the story. The top notch artwork complements the graphical style of the game, and at the same time, the game is not at all intensive to run. There aren't any super hardcore textures, and there aren't any hardcore lighting effects, as the game's graphic style makes it for it by being unique. This means that even 'non-gaming' PCs ( or Macs ) and Linux based systems can run this easily.Personally, I believe Bastion to be a very solid title. It's not a triple A title, it's actually an indie game, and yet it's still recognized internationally to be a great title, despite being as small as it is. It's the kind of game that you have to try, even if you don't think you'll like it, and for good reason. Bastion is a great experience, and though you won't be getting hundreds of hours out of this title, every hour will be worth it, and worth a little bit more.			",91,18,1,6,9,0,22

												Bastion is pretty cool, I suppose. You play as the kid, a silent guy with white hair who likes to hit stuff with hammers and other weapons that aren't as good as the hammer. Some time before the events of the game, someone decided to pour pepsi and coke into the same glass and caused the calamity to happen, which killed a bunch of people and tore the world into cool narrative tool. Bastion plays from an isometric perspective and, much like whenever I decide to leave my dumpster, is narrated by a strange old man wearing an apron. He has a very pleasant voice though. Outside of a few grunts and shouts, he's basically the only voice you hear through the entire game, narrating the things you do, the things you see, what people are saying, whats on the lunch menu, how much time we have until break, etc. You fight with a two weapon load out with a few options for both buttons, things like hammers, spears, machetes, and flamethrowers go hand in hand with crossbows, bows, twin revolvers, a rifle...A-...A grenade launcher. Although the game lets you pick whatever weapon for whatever button, it usually pays off to have one melee and one ranged weapons on your adventure. Though quality in weapons changes dramatically, while some can smash your enemies to pieces, others you may as well be just write a sternly worded letter to them and mailing it via Canada Post.The joke is the mail is never going to reach them. Outside of your attacks, you also have two kinds of defence, a shield block and a dodge. The shield can negate most damage outside of obvious explosions or gas, if you time it right you can also get a counter where the enemy deals damage to themselves by attacking you like the stupid idiots they are. The dodge is actually pretty nifty and will work as long as you actually roll out of the attack instead of into it like you would in other games. If I had to twist my nipples at anything bad about this game I would say that your movement speed is so slow that you may as well be walking on the ground with those stupid bucket suction cup foot things you played with in kindergarten. And the game is so short it probably has trouble getting on any of the fun rides at Disney World. But should you play Bastion? You probably already have, considering how popular this game was back in the day. If you haven't I would give it at least one go, it's pretty fun, but I don't know how long that fun will last past one playthrough. if you can get it for the price of...I don't know, premium instant noodles? Then I would say go for it.Gas station gets 7 smooth narrator voices out of a possible 10.

~ The Kid just rages for a while. ~Great at first, but gets old very quickly. For every pro, there's a con. Let's start with the good stuff. The colourful, fresh art style and the fast-paced combat are Bastion's biggest pro's. It plays well, it looks great, the cold and unfamiliar atmosphere is well supported by the good soundtrack. Also, being able to change the difficulty in-game by using Idols is a great way to manually spice up the game if you're finding it too easy. Bastion is a quite easy game, so being able to experiment with that was a good touch. On the other hand, it's very vital that they did. Because the gameplay (despite fun in the beginning) tends to get old quickly. Sure, you unlock more weapons as you progress, but it doesn't take long before you familiarise yourself with a certain set and feel comfortable with it, so you don't have any incentive to use the other weapons. The underwhelming story and mediocre level design don't really incentive you to adapt to environmental dangers either. It all looks so much alike, you progress is the same fashion as the first hour, the narrative pacing is very sub-par. Most of the time it's a straight path with very little dead ends where you can find extra items and upgrade materials.+ Visual design is colourful and looks good.+ At first, gameplay was fun and being able to change the combat was a great touch.+ You can experiment with the difficulty yourself (with the Idols).+ Nice soundtrack.+ The narrator gave the game its own unique identity at first, but...- Later the narrator just becomes boring, adds nothing new, and even gets a little annoying.- Gameplay gets old rather quickly, despite being able to spice up the combat. If it wasn't for that, it would have even gotten old a lot sooner.- Uninteresting story with even less interesting characters.- Mediocre, unmemorable and extremely linear level design that doesn't do the good art style justice.- ""Action RPG""? Don't make me laugh. This is absolutely the bar minimum. I don't recommend it. I got it for free, and even then I feel disappointed. So to me it's not a matter of price, but a matter of spending your time with Bastion. To be very honest, in hindsight I think I would have rather spend my 11 hours on something else. It had great potential, but unfortunately it just gets old so, so quick.			",223,44,2,27,7,1,28

												Bastion's narrator is probably what most people know about this game. It's a pretty good work of design, writing and voice acting. The game also looks and sounds amazing, with vibrant visuals and soundtrack that ties incredebly well with its story. But, most of all, what is amazing about the game is its gameplay. When it launched Bastion raised the bar from what we could expect from indie games. Not only are the controls tight and responsive, whether you're using a controller or mouse & keyboard, it's just amazing how well designed the weapons are, how unique and game changing they feel as you acquire them. Consider this a universal recommendation: no matter what kinds of games you usually play, you should buy and play Bastion.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Narration, graphics and soundtrack. These are the main terms used when people talk about this game. What will strike your mind when you first start this game is the harmonic voice of the narrator. Better get used to it because he will bombard you with endless commentary about the schizophrenic postapocalyptic surroundings, lore and travails of our silent protagonist. The narration is rugged, dramatic and quite serious. I mean, just look at the place, it is torn asunder. The game itself provides mainly action-filled gameplay with a bit of RPG-ing with collecting weapons, resources and lore items. You can use the resources to upgrade your weapons in endless variations. The playthrough is not very difficult and you can finish the game with your favourite weapons, but the difficulty raises significantly in the Proving Grounds and in the free DLC challenge mode where most builds don't work very well. What I liked most about this game has to be the soundtrack. When the narrator gets a bit annoying near the end (mainly because the story doesn't stand up much to the other factors of the game), the soundtrack never ceases to surprise you. It combines many styles and some tracks became one of my all-time favourites.7.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bastion is one of those games that will always hold a special place in my heart. This game strikes so many notes in all the right places that one would be hard-pressed to point out its flaws. In terms of storytelling, Bastion offers up a tale that will keep you engaged until the oh so sweet end. The gameplay is superb thanks in part to fluid combat and numerous customization options. The gorgeous hand-painted visuals make this game look like a painting that has come to life. Then there's the soundtrack. Ohhh the soundtrack. Be prepared to get lost in audio bliss. Perhaps the most unique and welcome touch is the ever-present narrator who guides you through your adventure. It's one thing for a game to have great aspects to it, but it means nothing if they don't meld. Bastion is a game with a number of wonderful elements, the sum of which, equals a cohesive whole that you absolutely must experience. Grab a drink and pull up a seat. It's time to play some Bastion.			",55,2,0,7,0,2,6

												It's rare for me to play games of this type but I am extraordinarily glad that I took a chance with this one. From the beginning the beautiful visuals immerse you in a world that is both unique and wholly familiar; many games of this type exist but Bastion truly stands above the rest due to the unique concept of the platforming system and the art style. The narration provided by the gravelly-voiced Logan Cunningham made me press on even when I grew bored or disinterested.He's a serious talent in this arena.Gameplay was not overly challenging, although I admittedly did not complete all parts of the game, such as some of the Challenge Zones and the dream sequences. My goal was to see the main story through because it interested me, even if the twists and turns weren't all that surprising, it was compelling. Much has been said of the soundtrack but I'm still going to talk about how gorgeous Ashley Barret's vocals are, and how perfect Darren Kolb's guitar work and compositions were. Get this game, play it, and if you don't like it, please tell me why.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Intro:Bastion is an isometric action-adventure game with an absolutely incredible visual style, fun and engaging combat, an engrossing narrative told by survivors of worlds that collided.  One of the core elements of Bastion is exploration and discovering the truth of the new world. You can uncover more through mementos, ash remains of old friends and folks long past, and the narration of a stranger.  The narration is remarkably well done and manages to convey so much without too much repetition.  They have tons of variations for even the small things like visiting a challenge area multiple times.  Gameplay:Combat is very customizable and can suit pretty much any combat style if you invest enough shards of the old world into your weapons.  Each weapon has different strengths and benefits, as well as varying timings to excel with; this makes the combat extremely reactive and very skill oriented.  The only complaint I have regarding combat is the order with which you unlock certain weapons.  I think it could have had the player decide at least a few times what weapon to make/unlock and help them find their preferred play style more quickly. I tried pretty much every weapon and upgraded them all at least once, but I definitely found a few that I preferred over others.  I did have a little trouble distinguishing the actual level from the background at times due to perspective; some partially destroyed walls looked to be traversable and I would roll off into the oblivion as a result.Story:I won't go into much detail regarding the story as I think all players should experience it for themselves.  In my opinion, there are a few minor faults to the story, but they don't matter much and are just slightly inconsistent with the setting/world more than anything seriously problematic.  Thematically, Bastion's narrative has very clear and strong writing that the player can influence with how they approach the challenges set before them.  Some examples follow: If you choose to remove all the pests from an area, the narrator will remark on it; just keep running and ignore the enemies if you want, etc.Audio:Without a doubt, Supergiant Games created one of the very best sound designs and soundtrack I've ever heard for any artistic medium.  It blends so many different styles and musical instruments that it just feels completely different and fresh when you discover a new track.  I spent quite a lot of time just enjoying the music when I unlocked the gramophone, which lets you listen to any of the game's soundtracks. Value & Time:I spent around 10 hours to do most of the content available in the first playthrough, while unlocking 11 of the 24 achievements.  My plans are to play through some of New Game Plus to see the new content that is only playable in that mode, but I don’t think I’ll play through the whole game again right now.Overall:Bastion gets a Highly Recommended and is an extremely polished title that pretty much anyone will enjoy.  This is an incredible, memorable adventure that more people need to play through.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Kid writes a review, and isn't too sure what to say. Ten outa ten, best game of the year, or a fine work of art, words of praise that's hollow with no real meaning. You could say this kid wants to write about the solid gameplay, engaging story, beautiful world, amazing soundtrack, and a fine narration. But the kid knows better... The game left him feeling satisfied in the end, no one can say he had a bad time. But all phrases and words just don't cut it for the Kid, so he'll leave it like this, Bastion made him happy like a Scumbag with a full stomach.			",177,38,1,10,4,2,17

												When I first loaded the game, I was stunned - the game's art is just too captivating. I love how they made it look so gorgeous although the claim it's hand painted. The world is beautifully painted, the characters designs are cute and aptly made for the game, the animations are incredible. You owe your eyes to look at this game.Bastion is a story driven game with great art and legendary Narrator. Yes I said it - legendary. I really like how the Narrator performs, he actually narrates most if not all Kid's (our protagonist whom we control) actions. His deep voice brings a new gaming element for real. The story itself is one kind of common topic - to restore the 'world' that's been destroyed by the Calamity. The combinations between the narrator, game's art, narrator and OSTs, though, make it feel different.The OSTs themselves are ear-catching. Most platformer games I play I usually don't care about the OSTs, some even were so irritating I turned them off. In Bastion? I love every second the OST is played. Gameplay is a mix between RPG and platformer. You can actually assign weapons/shields/power ups, have potions and the pure hack and slash aspect. You can't hack and slash your way, though, since it requires more than that. Evasion and blocking skills are also essentials, some enemies you can't just pew pew. That said, playing with controller is recommended.For people who love challenge, Bastion has plentiful for you. Starting from Hard difficulty, to New Game+, to Idols. Idols is a feature in game that actually tamper the situations of your choosing. If you want more exp but harder enemies, there's one feature for you.Overall, the game's a bit short. Only 10 hours or so for normal to hard difficulty. For completionist it will take more hours. I'd love to get Bastion 2 to compensate this, but Bastion simply is a game that should end just there. You'll understand when you finish the game.For 80% off, this is a steal. Shame the OST isn't on sale also.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There is no way you wouldn't love it.Bastion is a beautiful game in which each element fits properly. The hack and slash gameplay is fun and amplified by leveling up your character, improving your weapons, and making the game harder through idols. There's so much to discover. The story is traditional stuff, but I was wrapped up in the experience from the main menu to the credits thanks to leaderboards, easy to navigate menus, and more.Just a beautiful world. The characters are detailed, the colors are rich, and the world forming underneath the kid's feet is a nice touch.The sound effects, the score, and the narrator (Cunningham's sensational debut role) are all excellent.The game after the first time tells you that there are still many things to do before you eventually turn it off.Try it for yourself and fall in love.

												Bastion is a truly fantastic game. This one had been on my radar for a while, and I was lucky enough to grab it at a discount. I have to say, though, that after playing it, it's worth every penny at full price. There's truly something for everyone here. It's got RPG elements, beautiful world design, post-apocalyptic storyline, hack and slash ""everything dies"" free-for-alls, weapon mechanics, challenging achievements, and an intriguing story with heavy moral choices along the way. The full controller support couldn't function any perfectly, and the graphics are astounding. The soundtrack is also excellent and seems to enhance the experience even more. Characters are multi-dimensional, and combat is dynamic. There's definite replayability here, as well as many challanging yet fun achievements.The Stranger is beyond a doubt my favorite character, and it seems that a lot of thought went into character development and world-building. It's a fantastical combination of old West and ethereal  fantasy realm. This looks like a game that was designed by gamers who just happen to know how to create video games. It's got so many wonderful elements strung together that it's very likely that the developers sat down to design and code a game that they themselves would enjoy playing. I have to say, they hit the ball way out of the park with Bastion.Without spoiling anything, I'll just add that a cerebral gamer will find other hidden gems in the storyline. I found myself speculating about time paradoxes, time travel, self-fulfilling prophecies, and the identity of The Stranger. I'm so fascinated with this game that I'm beginning my second playthrough now. I highly recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Like, pretty much the best isometric, 2D game you are ever going to play in your life.I like it so much I cannot recommend this enough. If there was, like, a rating system, maybe one to one hundred, this game would be a solid 100/100. I'd boot Bastion up and play it every day all day if I could.This game is just incredibly good for an indie game. Most games you see with, like, a soundtrack, you might go ""ohh some guy thinks his music is good, ha ha"" no, this guy, Darren Korb, did something ridiculously cool with Bastion. The soundtrack is just so good. Every step of the way you'll be like oh my god I am so digging this music, even while platforms fall from the sky, or fall from under you.As indie games go, I don't usually say they are ever worth anything over $10. Bastion is the exception that proves me wrong. The, what, seven or so people who worked on Bastion have more than earned their chips (or whatever).It's better than Diablo III.It's so good.Get it, today.			",433,58,5,45,25,5,63

												Put simply, Bastion is a piece of art. Seriously. The soundtrack, atmosphere, artwork, story and voice acting are all fantastic! All of it combined create an experience ready for the player to enjoy a few hours of happy immersion. The way the game progresses is beautifully well made and all the different weapons gives the player the power to play through this game as however we want.I don't have anything bad to say about it and recommended it to everyone who enjoys a great game. Really, I'm only sad that I've waited more than 5 years to play this. Get it as soon as possible!➡️️Final Rating: 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Summary/ Overview     Bastion was published by Warner Brothers Interactive entertainment, a subdivision of Warner Brothers, Inc. developed by Supergiant Games, the studio also behind Transistor. Bastion is an action role-playing game with a ubiquitous narrator. You play as the Kid in Bastion who is given no specific name at all while you uncover what has happened to the Bastion after the calamity. The Bastion is the center marketplace you could say in the game that regenerates the life of the whole community. Through going back to the Bastion you can upgrade your weapons, skills; buy more idols through the lost-and-found, pay respects to the memorial of fallen people that have passed away through completing different tasks, switch out weapons in the arsenal and one of my favorite places to go, being the distillery where you can buy potions that give you statistic bonuses and added health, carrying capacity. Gameplay (Features, controls, graphics & mechanics)FeaturesLocations     There are many locations within the game and I want to touch briefly on a few. The few worth mentioning are The Wharf District, Trappers Shingle and the Hanging Gardens. These are among the first few districts you will visit when trying to collect cores. The cores are used in the Bastion, at the central monument in order to build add-ons to the Bastion since it got destroyed after the calamity. The Wharf district    You obtain your first main weapon, the breaker's bow, your first memento which are collectible items that either tell you some history about the culture or rather are commodities, fragments of materials that you need in order to craft weapon upgrades. You will learn your first special move and the basics in this area. The first special move is a whirlwind which you use with your basic weapon you start out with called the crael hammer. You are thrown immediately into the action as the story starts wherein the main character, Kid, has no idea how he got here through the Bastion, the safe haven and shelter of the town. The rippling walls remains transversed as you walk. Once you start walking forward down a certain particular path, the path expands as you walk. You learn that the calamity has happened and currently search to see if anyone else except you survived the calamity. If you are the only one that survived the calamity, then why did all the other cultures and races of people get wiped out? Trappers Shingle    Trappers Shingle is a very dangerous place in the game but the most unique. You have to run from the start to the finish of the whole area while watching platforms crumbling below your very feet. You need to hit targets on the sides before you proceed since everything has basically been tripwired in order to make you fall to your inevitable death. Good luck! You do receive a prize for your efforts based on how quickly you make it to the end. This is all dependent upon the time it takes you as well as any penalties in case you fall off the map. The Hanging Gardens     The Hanging Gardens is a place that honors the dearly departed, those that have died in the calamity. You meet a strange man named Zulf while everyone else is frozen in time, so frozen you can actually hit them and they disintegrate. Zulf is quite the character that later destroys the Bastion once again making your life hard after the calamity. Why is everyone frozen, does Zulf have special powers or rather has this dystopian alternate universe been created because of the after effects of the calamity putting a curse on the towns and all the people in it? You will have to play along to find out the final answer as the story progresses.Fully Destructible Environment    Everything in the game from pillars, pieces of walls, crates, barrels and enemies can be destroyed. You only get experience points for destroying enemies and boxes.Unique, Dismal, Comical Narration    I will be honest with you on this one, I am not a fan of the narration throughout the whole game. The narrator's tone and voice distracts too much away from the nice music and enemy encounters, lush environments.Water-colored, Hand-Painted, Crafted Environments    All in all, the art style is unique and does a good job attesting to the fact that video games are inspired art made for a manifest and also a latent function.Experience Points/ Skill Based System    It has an experience point system which you get by destroying objects and enemiesControls    Controls are very well done. I recommend using a controller since it feels most comfortable Pros & ConsPros•Nice artwork within the game's environment with solid graphics all around•Polished enemy variety with unique moves and abilities•Engaging story and premise of a world fallen and cursed through a time period known as the calamity•Fully destructible environments that oscillate location to location•Fun and relaxing to play•Great boss battlesCons•Narration is ok in my personal opinion, but it personally is just not my styleOverall- 8     Highly rated and recommended because it really is an amazing game that is worth all of your time and effort. Warner Brothers Interactive make some of the best games that I like to date.Key1-3 = poor4-5 = ok6-7 = good8-10= amazingFor more objective non-biased reviews, please visit my other account TheDragonsNiche(2) Alternate Steam PC Account Link https://steamcommunity.com/id/InsightfulJourney ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of all, I think ""The Bastion"" sounds better than ""Bastion"" , with that being said, lets get into the review.The game begins with the protagonist ""The Kid"" waking up from his sleep on his floating bed/home place while ""The Calamity"" has wreaked havoc in ""Caelondia"". The game doesnt use dialogue instead it relies on narration so there's that.And the game plays from a top-down perspective, so if you dont like that, i guess this one's not for you.Graphics : I like the art-style of the game, but I think its subjective and depends on your taste. I also like how all the land-pieces pop-up like some fog-of-war mechanic from strategy games. I guess it adds a certain kind of surprise value to the levels.Gameplay : The gameplay is this game's best aspect. The weapon variety is brilliant and all of the weapons actually feel unique (Breaker Bow FTW). The upgrading system is pretty standard and nothing significant. I also really liked the proving ground challenges (they are these levels where your proficiency with a particular weapon is tested). Another thing I'd like to add here is that, the upgrade points in this game, i.e, Fragments, are actually pieces of the Bastion before The Calamity, so this means that when you destroy like pots and stuff, it actually makes sense that they give Fragments. I mean, its not anything great, but just a simple observation. Rest of the stuff is pretty standard and that's that.Story : The story is actually good, but I feel like they still didn't explain it well enough (It might just be me because I'm kinda slow at picking this stuff up, but still I stand by my view). The ending (or rather endings) were ♥♥♥♥ing awesometacular (its an RPG, so expect multiple endings), they were well thought-out and it feels like there is no right choice, both of them end up in the morally grey area, like how Mark Of The Ninja's ending was and that IMO is fantastic. The narration aspect works really well in the majority of the game, but sometimes it feels like dialogue would've been better. There's enough backstory to provide good character depth and to understand each of the character's motivations. (Sorry if there were any spoilers)Soundtrack : The soundtrack is very good but at times it feels a bit under-used. For the most part of the game, there's only ambient music in the background which although is good, gets boring after a while. There is some really good music in this game, but it only ""appears"" at a few places throughout the entire course of the game, which I think is diappointing, but still the soundtack is a pro first and con later.Voice Acting : There is only one voice actor to judge in this game, i.e, The Narrator/Rucks and he is awesome. That more than sums up his work.All in all, this game is not a must-get, but most definitely worth-it. And its often on sale, so pick it up then.Rating : I'd rate this one 8 Squirts out of a possible 10Final Word : Scumbags. Them damn Scumbags.Edit : After finishing the game a second time, I gotta make some changes, the soundtrack of the game was absolutely brilliant and not underused as I previously thought. Also, I gotta improve the rating to a 9 Squirts out of a possible 10(I used way too many quotes, didnt I? )			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a must-play.Bastion is proof that you can have a fantastic plot without interfering with gameplay through such evils as cutscenes and noninteractive animation sequences. Brilliant voice acting, great music, and silky smooth gameplay which never gets interrupted to tell its gripping story. Not much replay value, but the time you spend in this world will be memorable.The game is an action RPG, where much of the combat focuses on dodging and target selection. Cooldowns are very short which makes combat feel more like a shooter since there is no need to memorize a rotation.Story is told via narration during gameplay.Subscribe to my curator page hereView my other reviews here ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bastion isn't a game. Bastion is an experience. The gritty overtone of a man who sounds like he dragged his last from one too many cigarettes, tossed in with jaw droping visuals straight from a trip, combined with solid gameplay. You found a hammer? You get to hit things with it. Found a bow? Draw it back and let lose, kiddo.Bastion is a game where simplicity matters. The simple yet engaging and often challenging combat will leave you wanting more, the few drips of story keeping you interested while the narration and art style buy you in farther. I'll say it again:Bastion isn't a game. Bastion is an experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is one of a kind. I would say however, to make sure you have a gamepad if you plan on playing, it works really well and I'd imagine it just wouldn't be the same with keyboard; pretty sure it was designed to be used with a gamepad.The game is definitely high quality, so whether it's worth it really comes down to price while considering the length of the game. I'd say if you can get it for under $5, it's a must have. If you only have the option to buy at the full price of $15, it's harder for me to recommend, but only because the game is quite short. Consider the game will probably last you 6-7 hours for a main story playthrough.Keep an eye out because the game goes on sale every now and then and it has also been on humble bundle before.

												Bastion is an action RPG game played in an isometric view were you play this character named Kid.The world you play in is in ruins after the so caled Calamity. Its your job to put the world together. To do this you have to explore and gather pieces named Cores. Along the way you will find new characters, weapons, scenarios and a lot more.The world of Bastion is amazing. It looks like an alive oil painting with fluid movements in it.If you are like me and care about the soundtrack of a game, prepare to be amazed. The sound track of this game is quality in person and very well paced. You have your ""sad songs"" and ""happy songs"" in the right time, at the right place.Another amazing aspect is the narration. It follows your actions along your journey, if you for example fall down a hole you can be sure that the narrator will tell a little joke about it. The use of a gun, an item, the path you take, all have a narration. The voice acting is suberb and the tone of the voice beautiful. All of this makes your experience and imersion even better.Bastion is one of those games that shouts: hey you don't need fancy graphics, complex storylines or explosive soundtracks to create an engaging and fun game. And they are right.Positive- Amazing artwork and graphics- Original and engaging narrative- Beautiful soundtrackNegative- Too short (about 8 hours)- Low replay value			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bastion is a polarizing game. Basically, I feel confident in saying you will either love this game to bits and find yourself writing essays about how brilliant and deep and awesome this game really is, or find it one of the most obscenely, dangerously overrated, yet pretty good-looking and fine-sounding, piece of pretentious indie [you know that word] you'll ever play.Luckily for you, Oh Revered Prospective Buyer, you don't need to rely on the confusing cacophony of opinions of other people to figure out which camp you'll find yourself in in. Like, don't like, and wait... why? For, you see, O Might One, this game is endowed with the Mystical Power of The Demo.Demos are strange beasts and too often misleading ones as well, willfully tricking the Player. But this will not be the case for Bastion: you will either think this game has the most boring minute-to-minute gameplay experience of the isometric action RPGs you ever had the terrible misfortune to play, or that it'll be to you about as good an invention as The Revered Sliced Bread, maybe even a slice better.It doesn't matter which button I'm going to press when I am done writing, because obviously the majority thinks I'm the minority and thus this one single vote is simply a drop in the ocean and won't matter one single bit. That is fine and dandy as it gives me a chance to be completely honest without incurring in any unwarranted backlash, isn't that true Almighty Community?You won't downvote this <cough>review, because while I almost dread every single hour I spent on it (, I'm still encouraging people to be open minded instead of trusting my judgment blindly, as it were The Word, and try the demo for themselves. Which you should really do: you have very little to lose and much to gain.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bastion is a 2D, WASD controlled with mouse aim game, where you play as a ""Kid"". The story gameplay (without going for achievements, and side-stuff of the game like challenges) it takes about 6 hours to play the game. Even though it seems like there are only 2 diffuculties, throughout the game, you can add some spice by some choices inside the game, even though it's not compulsory. Level design is well crafted, it can be a fun challange for hard players, yet can also be and easy journey for casuals. PROS:- Easy to adapt gameplay - Tutorials are just in place, you don't really go wondering, ""Oh what's this?""- Story is amazing. - COLOURS <3- For someone who doesn't really care if about the OST's (of games) this will be the first time that I'm going to listen over and over and over probably. Sounds, Narration, OST's are just tearjerkes.CONS: - Not really to be honest. Maybe narration thing is not for everyone, but for me, it really is a different and a nice touch for the game overall. You must really have some specific taste in games to not like this game.Overall, Bastion is a beautifully crafted, cute but deep, a lovely game, that you can actually be challanged to do some stuff. I actually feel like standing up and applauding the developers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you are a PC Gamer and have somehow managed to go this long without playing Bastion, I want you to stop reading this review, and buy this game. I'm serious. Do it now.Now that you have done that, let me explain why.Bastion is nothing short of a masterpiece. Visually stunning, deeply engaging narrative, bowstring tight controls, and one of the most poignant soundtracks I have ever heard in a game. I have literally nothing to criticize and nothing but the highest praise to offer.As a game designer, this is the kind of game I one day dream of making, It's just that good.So, get it. You won't regret it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bastion is one of my all-time favourite games. You play as The Kid, a survivor of a terrible conflict, who has the sole responsibility of trying to piece his world back together, amongst the debris of those who are no longer with him.It's difficult to know where to start, as so many aspects of this game blew me away. First of all, the narrator, Logan Cunningham, makes a groundbreaking debut as the voice of ""the Narrator"", perfectly capturing the ambience and style of the game, improving it ten fold.Next, the soundtrack. It is actually amazing. It won both Best Original Score and Best Song in a Game (Build That Wall) at the Spike VGAs, which should highlight just how good it is.The gameplay is fun and complex, and after I completed the story (roughly 15 hours I think), I found the extra levels huge fun, taking my full-played time with all 10-idol dreams completed to 26 hours.Buy this game. If you own it, play it. You will not be disappointed. Highly, highly recommended.-Nilesy			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Product received for free
												This game is a little gem among the Indie category... It is linear, but the sotry is good enough and gameplay is super cool. Lots of levels for a smaller budget game, many cool unique weapons you can use, upgreades you can buy and runes that will make the game more challanging, but at the same time it will reward you. High replay value, due to the upgreade system... What can I say more? + Loot, upgreade and runes that modify the gameplay.- A little bit too linear.Yep buy it if you into Indie games, and with a discount it is even more worth it!!

												So, for some reason, this game sat in my backlog for a long while, which was basically a terrible thing considering how much awesome this game had to offer. Anyway, I played through it today, and I can confirm what a lot of people have already said repeatedly....THIS GAME WAS AMAZING!Seriously, the gameplay was flawless, the upgrade system worked beautifully, the artwork was incredible, the idea of the road crafting just ahead of you with on the spot narration from the equally amazing Logan Cunningham, the amazing soundtrack....pretty much everything about this game was superior to 99% of the other games out there. An absolute must own and must play.The ending had a surprisingly difficult choice to make. Which brings to light just how effective the story and storytelling was leading up to that point. You actually care about the world and dont want to make the wrong choice. That said, I'll probably play NG+ and go with the other ending so I can play to both conclusions.10 out of 10			",2042,1028,52,317,205,18,280

												Bastion is a narrative-driven beat-em-up that will have you giggling in awe like a front-row Justin Bieber-fangirl quenching on his saliva-shower.The mechanics are easy to learn, the weapons provide a lot of variety as you unlock them througout the campaign. There is a lot to discover on the worldmap, though the linear story encourages blazing through the game The graphic style is easy to interpret but the fixed isometric view makes for some awkward camera angles in some maps.The soundtrack accurately switches the mood from 'solitary sorrow' to 'button-mash till literally everything is destroyed'There are really two reasons to buy Bastion, both of which are extremely valid. One: The narrator sounds like Morgan Freeman Radio FM!Two: You feel the urge to purge hunderds of weird♥♥♥♥♥monster hordes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Maaaan, how come It took me over 5 years to find this piece of art in Steam Store? Oh well, alright, I'm getting to the review:Story:I do want to avoid spoiling anything, so I'll just leave a little bit of that here.You play as a character that is being refered to as ""The Kid"", setting off on a journey to redo some things the calamity that hit your world has taken away. The whole story is being told throughout the game as you advance further.Gameplay:You move with the Kid throughout the levels as in the any other game, WASD keys, the levels are platforms set up in middle of nowhere, just high up in the sky most of the time. The platforms automatically build themselves infront of you when you get close. The combat system is what is really shining in this game, most of the weapons are equally powerful, there is not one being largely stronger than another, and you can wield 2 weapons at once. One weapon's attacks done by mouse 1, and the other's by mouse 2. Apart from that you can also use your special abilities, such as being able to go invisible, to throw a grenade, to shield yourself and deflect the damage...Bastion is a 3rd person RPG that comes in with fighting some monsters, the monsters have various kinds of abilities and weaknesses, so a different weapon might come in handy against each of them.There are 3 modes you can play at the beginning of the game, easy, normal, and no-sweat mode. Easy is easy, normal is normal, no-sweat makes you unable to die in the game, being infinitely able to stand back on your feet when you're defeated, I guess that's something for those that just want to play for the story.There is a leveling system, allowing you to reach up to level 10. Each level unlocks you a new distillery slots, you can fill those slots with various brews that will give you buffs in the fights such as mitigating the damage you take by 15%, being able to carry 2 extra healing potions, guaranteed critical hits when your HP is less than 33% and so on.You can also upgrade your weapons if you gain enough crystals that are gained from completing various quests, defeating enemies, or just breaking stuff around the map. You also need special forge materials that you can find across maps, buy for crystals in lost and found building, or gain in training grounds where you're supposed to see how good you are using that specific weapon you'd want to upgrade.You can also activate some blessings of the in-game's gods in a place called shrine... You thought blessings would make you stronger? Wrong! Although you get extra crystal drop rates from every blessing (there are 10 blessings that you can have all active at once), your enemies also become stronger. They can get buffs like health regeneration base on the blessings you activate. The shrine is not there to help you, as the game without the blessings is quite easy. It is there to make the game more challenging/fun for you.Game's art:The graphics are well-made and fitting the game, there's nothing much to say about it. Visually, the game is doing right what it is supposed to do. And yet, even a rusty graphics card like mine can run the game without issues.Bastion's music is a music that no other recent game has, although some of the tunes reminded me of Rayman 2 and similar older games a little, it still is different. I know many games like Bastion have great soundtracks, but this one is really compared to those other games.But there's something else, that is abnormally good, and I've never experienced something this good at any kind of game before. The narration. The voice was really appealing to me.Summary:Pros-Great, addictive story. Makes you want to finish the game on one playthrough.-Perfect combat system-Great graphics, yet even an old GPU can run the game with no trouble-Idea of how the game's terrain is presented is amazing-Best narrations I've ever seen in a game-Amazing music-Has a difficulty allowing you to play the game just for the story-On the normal difficulty, with all the shrine idols involved, trying to complete everything in the game (achievements included), I can certify you'll have over 10 hours of fun.Cons-Literally nothing, unable to think of anyMy final words:I've bought the game for 2.99€ when it was on discount, and although I wanted to spend them on something else, I do not regret I did not do that. I'm pretty sure I've already expressed how much I love the game above in the review, so I don't think continuing to compliment it is neccessary. If you're fan of this kind of games, I don't think there's any need to hesitate about buying Bastion, especially if the game is on discount.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bastion is a really cool action game with some amazing environments, an excellent soundtrack, and a mysterious, but ever-so-intriguing narrator. You play as a boy simply known as ""The Kid."" who lives in the world of Bastion, which had suddenly suffered a catastrophic event only known as ""The Calamity."" Not much is known about The Kid, at first, but later on in the game, you'll be able to access an area where your backstory can be heard and explained.In the world of Bastion, during The Calamity, the world started drifting apart, and islands started breaking up.Suddenly, monsters started to attack these various islands, and every single person in the game's world has been turned to stone... or is everyone? In Bastion, the ground comes up under The Kid's steps, or at least, the land that remains. You must visit these broken-up islands, eliminate the enemies that attack you, and collect shards of power, so that you can provide power to a large structure called ""The Bastion,"" which becomes your player's home base. It also becomes the only safe haven, and the player's space for new buildings that can be built, which allow many different bonuses, utilities, and can provide different challenges.The game's currency, fragments, can be used to purchase upgrades, make buildings, and improve weapons. Gaining experience also boosts the player's stats and gives them more health. Throughout the game, there are various weapons that you can collect, although you can only have two equipped at a time. You can also equip a special attack, and there are quite a few different types in the game. Enemies drop potions, that, when drunk, can restore some health or give you the special items needed in order for you to use your special attack moves. In order to change your weapons, you must use an arsenal at The Bastion.The environments in Bastion are very nicely made and quite unique. Each one has a different look and feel to it, as well as different enemies. You'll often find structures and ruins, and places where life suddenly stopped; when The Calamity hit. You will come across many fun and challenging areas, as well as challenges that reward you with EXP and with other items.Bastion's soundtrack, written by Darren Korb, is stellar. It's very fitting to the game, and very immersive. It's got its own unique style, and it's energetic, Western, and they've got some really catchy beats along with those awesome acoustic and folk-type songs, some of them with a vintage but breakbeat theme.In the game, you will meet some new characters as well, but I will not spoil anything about them in this review. Their personalities are quite varied, just as the landscapes in Bastion.I would recommend Bastion to anyone who loves action games with fun combat and with a really cool story! ^.^			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I hope that many years from now Bastion is remembered as the quintessential retro game of the downloadable era. Too many game developers have settled to plagiarizing outdated game mechanics, putting the end product through a pixelated filter and justify a frustrating experience by calling it ""Nintendo hard"" to gain that somehow glorified honor of being called ""retro"". Well I'm old enough to have lived throughout that period and wise enough not to glorify it through rose-tinted glasses. I also remember the sense of discovery that came from trying out new weapons and destroying everything, so I'm glad to say Supergiant Games has well understood that concept while making Bastion!The setting behind the story could best be described as ""Frontier Fantasy"" with your analogs to pioneers, marshals, mines full of mystic crystal cores and dispossessed natives undercutting your mission to rebuild the Bastion, aka humanity's last refuge. You'll read a lot about this game's very own narrator whose grizzled voice is there to give your actions a certain gravitas. It works, but having him be the sole source of exposition makes it near impossible to connect with anything else! You barely interact with anyone and if you do talk to other characters, the narrator tells you what they say! A whole universe experienced through the pinhole of one old man's words, that's what Bastion is!The world itself could best be described as an isometric sky platform badly in need of handrails. Forget pixels, this is all hand-drawn art with individual sprites and the result is a full and vibrant environment with a diverse menagerie of monsters, each with their own characteristics, some even with their own backstory! In an age of heavily processed animations, still having hand drawn graphics is the most retro thing there is!The actual fun in the gameplay comes from trying to find the right combination of two weapons with which to face the dangers ahead. You build quite the arsenal throughout your journey and each weapon has its own skill tree in which thankfully, you can change your decisions if you're unhappy or just feeling experimental. This is important because you'll soon come across a variety of binary needs, most of which aren't readily evident. I mean, you can understand quick & short-ranged vs slow & long-ranged but soon comes factors such as spread damage, weapon stun, poison vs direct damage, the issue of armor penetration and so forth. Needless to say, every weapon is unique and it's the combination thereof that makes the gameplay so engaging.Much appreciated are the training camps for each and every weapon along with the dream sequences which just has the Kid fight wave after wave of enemies. They're supplemental, optional and a great way to acclimate yourself with the new toy you just discovered in that one stage. I also liked the timed shield reflect mechanic which might be overpowered since it also reverses melee attacks. You also have access to about thirty Secret Skills, super moves for all of your weapons; however since they are all activated by collectable Black Tonics these all turn into so many different ways to press an emergency ""SAVE ME"" button.There's A LOT of exposition dump concentrated early on but I'd say that the game really picks up after finding your third or fourth Bastion shard and opening the Forge which allows you to start customizing weapons. There's a self-awareness in that the game realizes all that it wants to accomplish but still attempts to be as accessible as possible; heck, even the difficulty system works on an individual monster upgrade system, though one that is non-essential towards the story. Bastion is this most ambitious of undertakings but still provides gameplay relatable to a child. A rare gem that should truly be enjoyed by all.			",62,3,0,4,1,2,13

												Bastion is a very unique game. The story line is extremely captivating, and it's easily one of the aspects I love most in this game.  The biggest thing that kept me playing this game was wanting to find out what happened next (I'm a huge story fan - A game with a good story is a game that I finished with love). The gameplay in this game is also something I haven't experienced before. The combat is very interesting, and there are a lot of small details in this game that I took for granted when I started playing this game (the automatic targeting system helps a lot more than I thought :p). The Bastion area in the game is also new to me. Various buildings, all with unique purposes that all work together to make the gameplay more fun and interesting, and are all beneficial in their own special way. My favourite one easily being the Distillery, because I like being able to customize the bonuses I get for each level at any time, and always being able to unlock more and become even more powerful.I really enjoyed being able to upgrade my weapons, and then choose from a pair of upgrades that you can go with. Differently from most games, you don't have to pick your way through an entire skill tree to get to cool abilities, and you also have the option of easily changing what you picked at any time. Though the normal skill tree is fun, and can easily change how you play a game, I always found it difficult to decide which tree to go with and worried about picking the one that I wouldn't like. What if I don't like freezing enemies, and I would rather burn them? What I like about this game is that you can easily switch between the weapon upgrade that you want to use. It may not affect gameplay as much, but I still found this to be more enjoyable.Something I think this game lacks is replayability. When I first completed the game, I figured I would start again and continue trying to improve my character. I did it for a little while, and restarted the story, but it just didn't have the same effect. It wasn't quite the same after the first playthrough. It didn't have anything new, even in the new gametypes you unlock that allow you to continue with all your old gear. Another issue is that at that point, the game is pretty easy. You have all the best weapons, all with really good bonuses, and the difficulty is barely increased. It's possible that it gets more difficult farther in, because I didn't get far before I stopped the replay of the game.*WARNING* WEAPON SPOILERS IN FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHAnother aspect I don't like about this game is that certain weapons are far better than others. I always found the fang repeater and the duel wielded guns (that I don't remember the name of) to be completely useless, having never used them outside of the practice zone for those weapons. For long range weapons, I used the bow until I got the Galleon cannon thing (that I also don't remember the proper name of) and then I used the calamity cannon once I got that. I never really had the need for anything else.I also never used the skill associated with Q. It could be just me, but I was never particularly aware of it's existence and the only time I really used it was the occasional fight where that's what you were supposed to do. There's no particular emphasis to remind you to use it other than the constant finding of new abilities (which also never gives you the chance to use the old ones if you're like me), and there is no need to use it as I got through the game without too much trouble not using the Q skill.I think the usage of Shrine Idols rather than an actual automatic difficulty increase is interesting, but I also never wanted to do it. I prefer a simple switch from Normal to Hard, rather than having to activate shrine idols and worry about which ones seem harder than others. This is probably just a personal thing, but the Shrine is always a building I avoided.Overall, I don't think the game is worth $15. I wouldn't want to pay more than $7 for a game that I'm going to play less than 10 hours of, but when this game goes on sale (it seems to have some pretty big sales when it goes on sale too), I hope it gets into your Steam Library because you won't regret playing through this epic adventure.

												This is not a bad game. But I've owned it for over 2 years and have tried picking it up on several different occasions only to never completely get into it. I don't feel very attached to the characters and story. It's all extremely vague, which can make some games fun because you get curious and want to explore more and play more. But if it wasn't for the narrator talking into my ear there would be no story. His voice is everything... and I kind of don't like that.The gameplay felt really tight. The weapons can be somewhat interesting when you combine them with different power ups. I probably should have set my game on a harder difficulty because I found no challenge to it, but that's my own fault. I used the keyboard. The artwork is swell. I never fell in love with the music, although it is ever-present and perfectly fitting. The enemies are cool but kind of repetitive. I think that's about it. There's really nothing that stands out wrong with the game in my opinion, except for the story resting so highly on one overdramatic voice, even though that's the part everyone raves about. And to me, if you have a problem with the story then you have a problem with the game because the story is one of the biggest reasons why I'd ever even play a single-player game.I believe that I now realize what my other main issue is. I said ""there's really nothing wrong with the game"", but there's also nothing that special about it either. You strip away the artwork and the [annoying] narrator and it's just some run-of-the-mill barebones top down ""twin-stick shooter"", as someone in my comments had said. Twin-stick shooter. That genre might still be fresh enough for many people but for someone like me gaming into their late 20's who has already played quite a bit of those it doesn't do enough for me. Bastion is just not for me I suppose.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Surprisingly fun. The gameplay is pretty good - you just gotta find the right tools for you.I personally prefer to use a controller, as with games like these it just feels the most natural to me. But PC controls are actually, after further testing *cough*, surprisingly strong standing on their own.The story - narration is top notch, but may not be for all.The soundtrack is amazing, and is some of the best I've heard since Undertale.It definitely surprised me, and I can't wait for more games from these developers.

Reviews for the Deaf and Hard of HearingOverall GameBastion is a wonderful game.  The art is beautiful and the storyline is just enough for an indie game to bring you back.  For the game itself, I give it a 9/10 - I fell in love with it and, although it's short, it is an experience not often found in games these days.GameplayAs far as gameplay, major events do not seem to require sound.  Almost everything happens on screen and has a screen shaking effect for important events, whether on or off screen.For gameplay accessibility, I give it 10/10 - the game can be played to completion without or with limited sound.Subtitles/TextBastion is fully captioned, but can be confusing about who is talking at first.  There is a narrator that speaks during the gameplay.  It's not essential information for the game, but it does add to the story.For subtitles, I give it 8/10.  It was hard to figure out who was talking at first until I saw the character/narrator much later.Chatting/CommunicatingBastion is single player only.  No rating.Overall AccessibilityThe game's visual signals for events and full captions make it fully accessible for deaf/hoh gamers.  Hearing players frequently comment on the amazing soundtrack associated with the game that plays during gameplay and ties in with the story.  If you're hoh, you may still be able to enjoy some of the tracks.  Otherwise, no vital information is solely passed through sound.Overall, 9/10 for this amazing indie action/RPG game.

												Bastion proved to be an amazing, unforgettable adventure, and I will undoubtedly return to this world often.Everything about this game is beatuiful, even breathtaking; painstakingly detailed graphics, soulful music and songs. Grand, moving tale of Calamity upon Caeldonia and Ura, and of it survivors. One of the best Bastion's aspects, however, is the narration - you've never heard a better in-game narrator than our good, ol' Stranger, I can assure you.Actual gameplay is pleasant, although bit hard at some moments; luckily there is an option of adjusting difficulty. Challenges are in my opinion really quite challenging, too, elongating time spent in game.I recommend Bastion wholeheartedly - it's honestly one of the best games I've ever seen :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												No doubt Bastion has its share of flaws, but in the end the good far outweighs the bad and it's definitely deserving of a playthrough by just about everyone. The gameplay, the art direction, the music and sound are all excellent, but there are just a few nagging bits that dragged it down for me personally. It's best to start out with the art and the narration, as those are Bastion's immediate appeals. The art, as you know if you've seen any video or screenshots, is amazing. The hand drawn backgrounds appear before you as you traverse the level including plenty of destructible objects that can be bashed in for fragments of the old world, the currency in the game. The overall motif of the game is a sort of exotic, alien western populated by no shortage of bizarre creatures native to Caelondia such as Anklegators, Squirts, Rattletails, Lunkheads and more, but each level introduces new environments that always keep the game feeling fresh and making the player feel like they are progressing through this world. At some points it was difficult to tell what was destructible and what wasn't, and I ended up falling off the map a few times because I wasn't able to tell where the physical ground stopped and the background art began, but it's hardly worth mentioning. You gain a sixth sense for that sort of thing as the game goes on and it happens less and less. Another big appeal for this game was the ""interactive"" narration, and while it is charming every time you see it happen, it's utilized far less than I was expecting. It's funny to hear him say ""The Kid just rages for a bit"" when you begin smashing objects left and right, or ""It's easy to lose your way in the Wilds"" when you retread old ground in a level, but I can count on one hand the number of times I noticed a direct relation to what was being narrated and what I was doing, which is a real shame. I went into the game thinking this was going to be a major part of the game, but it happens less and less as you go on. Perhaps it's because the developers didn't want the tongue-in-cheek narrator stepping on the toes of the increasingly dark and serious storyline of the game, but either way I wish there was more of the narrator-player interaction.The gameplay is traditional hack and slash with counters, special attacks, customizable perks in the way of liquors you can equip, and plenty of upgradeable weapons to choose from (perhaps too many upgradeable weapons, I'll touch on that in a bit). The game has a varied collection of enemies for you to fight, each with their own strategies, strengths and weaknesses. Anklegators (Essentially a land narwhal that pursues the player underground until it's ready to strike) need to be lured out into the open before being attacked, but what happens when the game pits one of these at you in addition to a Lunkhead (Leaping armored frogs that must be attacked from behind) and a few Pincushions (immobile plants that shoot thorns at the player in a continuous stream) all at the same time? The player must use their loadout that they've customized, their evasive and defensive manuevers, and decide how they're going to complete the encounter, which almost always proves to be tricky and fun. Back at the Bastion, the level hub and also the main plot device of the game, players can use their Cores they've gained in the levels to populate the area with helpful structures, and Shards let the player upgrade those structures even further. The distillery let's players customize which liquors they want to equip which grant bonuses such as more health or a higher critical chance all the way to more loadout-specific benefits such as a higher counter-attack damage and doing more damage when falling on enemies. The Arsenal let's players customize which weapons and special attack they want to bring into battle, and the Forge let's them use upgrade materials they've found or purchased in the world to further enhance their effectiveness. One great thing about Bastion is that it doesn't limit what combination of weapons you can equip. Where most games would require you to have one melee and one ranged weapon, you can equip any combination in Bastion and it really makes you feel like you can take on the game however you want. The Lost and Found let's players use their fragments gained in the world to purchase upgrade materials, special attacks, and unique liquors that can't be found anywhere else, and the Memorial presents a number of goals that the player can attempt which will reward them with more fragments. The Shrine is my by far my favorite structure in Bastion. It gives the players a number of optional difficulty modifiers (similar to skulls in Halo) which reward those brave enough to activate them with substantial experience boosts throughout the game. Activate more than one and the rewards can be quite steep, granting the player up to 75% more experience, but also making the game much more difficult and in some cases even bizarre and unpredictable. While I love the modifiers such as those that slow the player when getting hit or make enemies drop grenades when defeated which let you scale the difficulty of what some might call a rather easy game for veterans of the genre to something more challenging, some just seem tedious and poorly thought out. One modifier randomly deflects attacks, and another causes enemies to become immune to attacks for a time. These don't make the game harder or the fights even necessarily more interesting, they just become longer and more frustrating. All the modifiers are optional however, so I suppose this is more of a nitpick than a significant complaint. What IS a significant complaint, perhaps only for me personally, is the frequency of which you get new weapons. If I remember correctly, you get a new weapon almost EVERY SINGLE LEVEL, excluding optional weapon challenges you can choose to play on the map screen. Not only that, but most of these levels are designed around using that particular weapon, and only rarely do the developers give you an arsenal mid level to allow you to switch back to your previous weapon if you don't want to use the level-specific item. It begs the question, what is the point of upgrading your items, customizing your loadout with special attacks and liquors, and creating a battle plan if the game is going to force you to use a new weapon (which you haven't had time to upgrade) every level? I get what they were trying to do. They want you to mix up your strategies on the fly, adapt to everything they throw at you, but a new weapon every single level? I don't get a chance to appreciate any of these weapons if you stick a new one in my hands EVERY SINGLE LEVEL. Some players might like this aspect so this point is largely a personal complaint, but it certainly feels like the game is undermining itself by giving the player all these tools to customize their playstyle and then ripping a whole through them at the beginning of every new stage. I also have to mention that many of your special attacks are tied to your weapon, so if you pick up a new weapon that takes the place of the weapon tied to your special attack, woops, I guess you get no special attack that level. Thankfully the music is amazing. It's a mix of instrumental western tunes, some arabian sounding themes, and even a few voiced songs by the characters' voiceactors. It's a good variety and a few even became stuck in my head. The story is somber and at times vague, but even though most won't remember Bastion for its story it does a good job of keeping the player's interest and making you eager to find out how it will all shake out. Bastion has its flaws, but at the end of the day it's still a fun game. It's been in a million bundles and it goes on sale for only a few bucks, so there's really no excuse to not at least give it a shot, and if you're one of those who have it sitting in your library for a rainy day like I did, give it a try, it's worth it.

												Wspaniała gra. Pozycja obowiązkowa dla fanów gier RPG. Świetna fabuła, świetna muzyka i piękna rysunkowa grafika.Elementy gry związane z rozwojem postaci czy rozwojem broni nie są zbytnio rozbudowane, ale wystarczą by trochę pokombinować. Dodatkowo są do dyspozycji poligony, gdzie można ćwiczyć posługiwanie się broniami, oraz mapy, na których do pokonania jest kilka fal wrogów.Po ukończeniu gry można zagrać ponownie w trybie ""plus"" z całym zdobytym ekwipunkiem i doświadczeniem.Polecam. Trzeba zagrać.Amazing game. Definitely a must for RPG fans. Great storyline, superb music and beautiful cartoon graphics. Game elements associated with the character development or the weapons development are not very extensive, but they are enough to combine a bit. In addition, we can find many Proving Grounds where we are able to practice weapon skills. Another good addition are maps on which our goal is to defeat several waves of enemies. After completing the game we can play again in the ""plus"" mode keeping our equipment and experience.I recommend Bastion. You just have to play it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A lovely game with amazing visuals, design and artwork. It's all about the white-haired kid, a bastion and a destructed world. The levels are interesting and invite to explore, there are many different weapons and special skills for our 'lil kid and it has a lot of replay value due to a ng+, a score system and two different endings. All in all it's a great little action-rpg with an easy but well done fighting system, a catchy story and some of the best soundtracks and voice actings I've ever heard in a videogame (seriously the narrator voice is brilliant!) - it can definitely be recommended without hesitation! The art, the style, the narrator voice and soundtrack in combination ... let's describe it with an ingame quote: ""OK, now that's just plain overkill. I mean, come on.""  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You can make a game with great mechanics or visuals or sounds or plot and it will still be just a game. By combining all of those in harmony in tight package you make an art. But if you go further and make all of those aspects shiny, neat and interesting - you will create a masterpiece. Such as Bastion.Unique, pleasant visuals. Memorable and solemn soundtrack. Nicely chosen narrator voice actor. Great, interesting plot with twists here and there. You will even have a moral choice. Smooth and fluid controls. More than that - the game isn't 50 hours long, its mostly concentrated fun. Leaves you wishing more yet satisfied with what you had..Overall: Quite a rare gem, must buy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A nice narrative-driven action RPG with very beautiful and colourful visuals. Bastion has you visit different stages in a quest for collectible items to help you restore the hub area (called The Bastion), which is a small flying fortress.The gameplay is similar to most other isometric action RPGs with hack and slash elements. There is a variety of enemies, weapons, and special skills. The game offers a nice hub area management, so you get to see it improving with each mission you. You raise important buildings, such as the forge, distillery, etc, which allow you to upgrade your weapons, buy stuff, accomplish memorial challenges, and even activate shrines of peculiar deities that make enemies stronger in exchange for earning you more of the game's currency with each kill. In addition to regular missions, there are also proving grounds associated with each weapon you find. These proving grounds provide you with unique challenges, and depending on how well you do, you get a prize. Each weapon's challenge is different. For example, the hammer's challenge requires you to smash 100 objects as fast as possible, whereas bow's challenges requires you to destroy all targets in as few shots as possible, and so on.I liked the variety of weapons the game had. It diversified the gameplay and allowed you to choose your preferred playstyle since each weapon acts differently and is useful in different situations (I personally enjoyed destroying things with a Galleon Mortar). For an action hack and slash game, it has a fairly good story. Don't expect something super tense and immersive, but you can be sure that you won't just be going from area to area with no goal. The narrator who speaks whilst you're out adventuring is also fun to listen to (and in my opinion way better than in Supergiant Games' other title Transistor).Overall it's been a fun game to get through. The presence of a couple of story choices in the final mission seemed a bit strange, since the rest of the game didn't have those, so this addition seemed a bit off, and some parts of the game could feel a tad repetitive, but otherwise there's nothing much to complain about.

YouTube™ Video: MOB Review: Bastion 

			Views: 139		

			Bastion is a Narration heavy hack and slash game available on Steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/107100/ Join us at Twitter or Facebook if that is your thing:...		

Bastion is a narrational led hack and slash game.  It runs smoothly,and offers leaderboards for those that enjoy them.  The music is wonderful,professionally done and really complementary to the combat and actions ofthe game, as is the voice acting.The story is based around surviving an apocalypse, and bringingthe other characters together.  The story reacts to your actions, whichmakes the player feel like they are actually making a difference.The game offers several different options for tailor making thedifficulty of gameplay, which can be changed in game.   Increasingdifficulty will allow the player to level up faster, but the game doesget harder with options such as the relic outpost.Resources can be accumulated during gameplay, which can be usedtowards upgrades, potions, or building.  Again, even the use of resourcesdepends on the choice of the player, which I can respect.The combat is fluid, and is tied to the story where who theplayer chooses to fight effects later battles and the universe.  I neverfelt like my time was being wasted, and every aspect of this game isintegrated and complimentary of each other aspect.  I have no problemrecommending it.This is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you towatch if you are looking for a more in-depth review.Thanks for your viewership and support; for more videos check click here.http://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bastion got me hooked from start to finish, despite not playing and liking RPG games in general... and that says it all!It's a great little indie RPG, with really nice story presentation and colorful backgrounds, well made gameplay and good soundtrack.Speaking of the story, it's a nice short fantasy tale, nothing too big, but the way it's presented keeps you interested enough. After all, the main game's length is 5-6 hours tops, so it definitely won't get you bored.The graphics are great and really fit the game's world, which is full of colors and beautiful environments.The way the ground shapes itself in front of you as you walk was a really nice addition too, totally innovative.The gameplay is probably Bastion's strongest point, the variety is big in pretty much all of the game's elements: weapons, enemies, power upgrades, side quests and items. The soundtrack is good and fits the world too, but it just didn't hook me enough.Aside from the main campaign, there are also some extra missions, in which you can raise the difficulty and, in order to get some achievements, you have to play in the highest possible one. They are the classic floors/realms in which hordes of enemies attack you and you have to survive to the end, beating the odds... I'm way too familiar with them thanks to games like Onimusha, God of War and Batman: Arkham Asylum and boy, did I miss this feeling, the one where you have to master the game's gameplay in order to get to the end, by aquiring experience through trial and error!Winning after many attemps felt really good!Finally, I wanted to note that this was the last game I missed from a list of great ""classic"" indies that I had made in my mind, which is made of the following games: Braid, Machinarium, Limbo, Super Meat Boy and Bastion!All of them have an ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" rating here on Steam too, so if you haven't played some (or all!) of them, go try them!Of course there are other great games of the same category out there, I don't dispute that, but for quite some time I had categorized the above games on my list of ""amazing little indie games to suggest to anyone"", so I really wanted to play Bastion to complete the list, having read so many good comments around it and despite it being an RPG... and boy, was it worth it!

 Personal Opinion: 9.7/10Worth The Money. I'd recommend.Pros:TL;DR -SoundtrackGameplayStoryCharactersPlot,Narrator's voiceCons:Doesn't have a second game.This game has an amazing storyline, lots of unexpected plot twists, (I know, that's the definition.)Plenty of extras, the game doesn't seem too hard at first, but then there are lots of things that get thrown at you that gets you to learn the game and figure out good pairs of weapons (war machete and dual pistols did it for me) , and with a controller or mouse, it's fun. The soundtrack is amazing. I actually bought it. The songs are noticable, they're good, and they fit. They make you want to listen over and over again. Unlike alot of modern songs.all and all. This game isn't another hole in the wall. It's definitely worth the money. ",74,5,0,6,3,1,3

												I have to say it's been a while since I played a game this good. It's not without it's flaws but there's so much good about it that the negative is barely noticeable.- The Good- Awesome, badass narrator/Actually get to meet the narrorator/Great voice acting.- Tutorial short and fun.- Controls amazingly.- Combat is some of the best I played in a while. Easy/Smooth/Fun. Counter ability is actually useful.- Auto-aim makes for easier and better flow of combat.- Most objects destructable (fun if your like me).- Collectables for extra xp.- Collectables have somewhat story's connected to them/Collectables connected to survivors.- Large variety of weapons/Skills for weapons/Can upgrade weapons/Upgrades give extra abilities that can be change at any time.- Large variety of skills.- Passive abilities for each level up/Large variety of passives/Can change what passives you want at any time with no penalty like weapon upgrades.- Can eventually buy skills, passives abilities, and materials for your weapons.- Get to rebuild Bastion/Get to choose what buildings go up first.- Game ran great. No frame drops, crashes or issues of any sort.- Alternate areas to go outside of the storyline/Weapon training areas for material to upgrade weapons/Arenas for grinding xp, money, and back story to main character and Zia - Singer.- Collect cores to rebuild Bastion/Boss fight for every core/Boss fights feel intense and most times challenging.- Music and sound effects are AMAZING. Some of the best, most memorable I've heard in a long time/Whether it was the main menu music, ingame music, fighing music, boss fight music or in Bastion music. All was amazingly composed and perfect for this game. Vocals are beautiful and not something I see many devs do.- Amazing story about ""The Calamity""/Search for survivors/Story about starting over.- Each survivor has their own story/Each have their own connection to collectables and tell what they know about them/Unneccesary detail but adds to the story of the game.- Can eventually add challenges for extra xp.- Large variety of enemies and ways to combat them/3 are commonly used but they aren't the only ones used.- Beautiful level design/Beautiful sceneries/Perfect mix of colors with the level design that made everything look good.- Money is really easy to collect, especially when the arena is added.- Perfect difficulty progression.- New game plus/Score attack mode (after you beat the game). Replay ability.- $14.99 Canadian/$11.40 U.S. With everything that comes with the game originally and the replay ability $14.99 is cheap.- The Bad- Healing fountains in the beginning not used after introduced/Not really needed.- Cannot return to previously finished levels.- Started to feel a little repeatative.- Don't understand why enemies were sometimes on my side or looked like they were being charmed.- Wish Kid had a voice actor.- No manual aiming, hard to deal with faster moving enemies.Overall I enjoy Bastion way more then I expected. As of right now it has to be one of the best games I played this year and if you don't own it already, you should.YouTube Video If Anyone Is Interested -

												Bastion is an RPG top down game created by an indie developer, Supergiant Games (creators of Transistor as you know). The game's setting is in Caelondia, a war torned atmosphere left by after the war between Uras and Caels (I tried to remember the plot but this is a close one as I can remember). You will play as The Kid, an amnesiac warrior who cannot remember the past and tried to unravel. This game's dialogue have a minimalistic feel because the protagonist doesn't talk and same thing as support characters as well. The narrative voice acting, oh man, the best voice acting I have ever heard in my whole entire life. The musical scores are top notch, especially when you are in the dream sequence and every region you explore. The graphics are eye candy and visually stunning, the art style is immersively well done, the animations are well executed. The combat system is solid and fluid, you can have 2 weapons to carry and you can change the weapons if you can find The Arsenal during missions or before starting the mission. You have abilities to choose from to eliminate enemies with ease. The Forge lets you upgrade your weapons but you need a particular parts to upgrade the weapon. The Distillery lets you drink any potions you like, it gives you the benefits for your stats but also there are side effects or negative effects in it. The enemy A.I. are smart and tough. Every enemy you encounter needs a proper strategy because they have different attack patterns and weaknesses, so it's best not to mash buttons to win. If you want a challenge(it's an optional), you can turn them on by building the Shrine and enable any idols you like to enable. I recommend everyone to use a controller, the controls are tight and responsive, no problem. There are 2 endings you can choose from, so it's better not to spoil for everyone (for the sake of not to ruin their experience).+ Pros+ Narrative Voice Acting and Musical Scores+ Graphics and the art style of the game+ Variety of enemy A.I. behaves and attack patterns differently+ Tons of weapons you can use, suited for your playstyle+ Replayability (New Game Plus available after finishing the game)- Cons- Keyboard and Mouse are not recommended unless you don't own a controller or don't like using a controller- Not many varieties for main objective (finding a same life crystal to restore the Bastion)In this game's honest review, I enjoyed playing this game, just relax playing this game while the narrative is soothing my ears. The graphics, the musical scores, narrative voice acting, solid combat system and challenges that made this game's biggest strength. But there is a lack of variety during missions like finding a life crystal, encountering NPCs, it's a tiresome experience for me. I recommend you to buy this game during Sale because it's $2.50 (just in case if someone doesn't like the game, correct me if the price point is wrong). It's a solid recommendation.

												This game is very comepelling, both graphically and story wise. Although it pesents a new gaming experience - with the spouting of new areas as you move on (though it has been practiced before, this game has a new system with it), it truly feels like home when you get used to it. Overall, this game deserves at least a solid ""4/5"", nothing less. I would recommend this game to all avid hack-and-slash gamers out there, with the addition of the RPG demographic.

												TL;DR A great 3D isometric adventure game with never before done story narrative with an incredible narrator. Getting it at full price is great but if waiting for a discount just know you will be missiong a story meaty game. What Is Bastion.In its core? A simple 3D isometric game where you collect crystal to advance the story while hoarding alcohol and weapons. Sounds simple ja? Not really. A deep system has a narrator narrate everything to you based on your actions and performances even boss types i must say get their own dialog to differentiate from the common rabble plaguing the world.Review a go!1:GraphicsA refreshing take on the indie game stuff, Bastion emplys colourful world that is reminds you of watercolour with everything has a distinct blob to it to help with the effect. Special attacks and enviromental damage are beautifully done. Not much else to say though.Here's a link to somewhat show what i mean. A gameplay video would be even better i suppose. [fish, steam deleted my link. oh well next time i suppose]2:SoundFrom the husky voice of the narrator to the frightheningly well done tempo music that ratchets up as you serve the beatdown on gunky slim Bastion apparently paid the sound guy quite a good of cash. Not getting in the way while providing their purpose there is nothing wrong with such an approach. The famous narrator of this game tells the story as you go and play with repeating challenges, killing enemies and even repeating a failed challenge will produce a different response from him each time. The warm husky voice definitely helped pull you in into the game world where no one else speak save for the surprise the game saves for you.Go do yourself a favour and download the OST even if you do not wish to buy this game. Its art by itself.3:Gameplay.Oh boy the meat!Where shall i shall i start? Well Bastion utilize a 2 weapon system that is mapped to the left and right mouse button respectively and clicking it will trigger said weapon. Now what makes this fun is that you have a shield that can block anything provided you counter at the right time or otherwise receive reduced damage instead and you even have a slot for 1 special attack that at the beginning has 3 charges. Sounds typical? Well here we go. Fights are often arena based with smaller enemies appearing before a bigger baddy appear for you to squash. In between the healing, the frantic sword fight and the 'OH DARN' moment when you realize you used all the special attack Bastion nailed the meaty delicious part of combat to the letter but it does help that the narrator keeps on narratin throughout the battle as you desperately struggles to block a giant sack of pus from squashing you as his gentle smoky voice guides you to death. Snarkiness is guaranteed.For weapons themselves....... lets just say i wouldnt spoil things but theres everything for everyone. I myself prefer bow and machete. Yes even in Bastion i play as berserker.4:NEW GAME + 5 years ago such a thing would be all too common, these days they have all but dissapeared into the gutter but what a pleasant surprise to see Bastion packing a new game + and boy do i like it. 2X Everything for everything that wants to kill you and 0.5 for yourself. enjoy cutesy Dark Souls. :3Conclusion.Great game, great story and great gameplay. Bastion narration held it strong all the way to the end where you shall get a satisfying ending as befit a gaming warrior such as yours truly. Recommendation to pick this up is a definite yes!P/S: Did i mention you should pick this up yet?If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator GroupCheck out the Original Network Groups.

YouTube™ Video: 60 Second Reviews: Bastion 

			Views: 1,554		

			Bastion may not look appealing at first, but trust me when I say that this is a game that you should seriously consider.		

""Oh look, Bastion, another indie game with a unique art style and shallow gameplay"" - Yep, that pretty much summed up my thoughts when I first saw the game. However, I decided to give it a chance before judging it so harshly, and I'm glad I did.Okay, credit given where credit is due. The art style of bastion really did blow me away. The way that every level builds itself as you go through it as well as the general design and even the characters themselves really won me over. Not to mention the narrator truly making the game feel unique.Where I expected it to fail, the gameplay, actually turned out not only to be fun and diverse, but extremely polished. Each of the 12 weapons behaves completely differently and you can mix up any two of your choice, combined with one of 30 secret skills, providing LOADS of ways to play.You slowly upgrade the Bastion however you want after completing each level, unlocking more options. There are some challenges to do here and there but besides that, the game is fairly linear. An average playthrough to one of the 4 endings will last about 5 hours but more content is offered in the much appreciated New Game+ Mode w, allowing for a lot more replay value.I'm trying to think of something bad to say but I find it difficult. Technically there is only 5 hours of content, so for £11.50, that is a lot. Also, the game may not appeal to everyone, it took a lot of self-encouragement to actually force myself to play the game. It doesn't do a good job at drawing people in initially.Bastion gets an 8 out of 10 from me on 60 Second Reviews.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I personally love RPG. I've just played Bastion in 2013. Is it too late? It's late, yes, but it's NOT too late. After clearing the entire game, I know that I'm gonna play it again in the future, maybe years later, I'll still feel impressed as the first time I did.Beautiful art; all colors, scenes, characters, monsters, items and well, everything is totally beautiful. I was captured when I first opened the game. While playing it, I absorbed the art and can't help, but feel impressed more and more.Good story; of course, RPG should has story. It completes itself. I can't actually review on the story much, just to avoid spoiling. But to me, at least, I love how the story goes...Enjoyable gameplay; I don't feel bored with the gameplay, not yet and maybe never. I finished the game with both different endings. And now I'm still playing it. Never been bored to collect the rest of achievements in New Game Plus.Awesome game world; the enrite game world is really interesting. It helps the story complete itself. Such an indie game that makes me impressed more than usual.I, myself, developed a role-playing game once. And to me, Bastion is really something. JUST BUY IT. IT WORTHS EVERY CENT OF YOUR DOLLARS.

												It would be another Calamity to miss out on this amazing game.Wonderful story.  Amazing artwork and animation.  Fun and rewarding gameplay.  Phenomenal soundtrack.  Usually games don't live up to the hype... usually games fall short.  For me, this game surpassed any hype and praise I'd seen for it prior to play and I can't recommend it enough if you're a fan of this genre of gameplay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Here is my review of Bastion:First waking up in Bastion you have no idea what is going on. What starts your adventure is that you do not remember anything about what happened to the world after the calamity hit.  Bastion follows the story of ""The Kid"" , who happens to survive all the events prior to the game. You first start of with just a trusty weapon and begin to slowly build your arsenal.Gameplay / Sound- it almost works as a action RPG. The action includes shooting guns with cooldowns, dodging to avoid enemy attacks and special attacks. The RPG element works with upgrading guns and deciding what weapons to bring into combat during a certain mission. Some of the weapons become ridiculously strong, but with the increase in difficulty it shouldnt be too much of a problem. Unlocking the shrines and using them makes the game more fun and it also creates a bigger challenege in the game. Outside of those the game plays pretty much like an action game more than a RPG one. Playing on different level makes the game feel as though the worlds are all different yet are a part of a bigger story. Sadly you do not get to see even part of the world. The soundtrack to this game is one of the best I have heard in any video game. Once you hear it, you'll want to download it and keep on listening to it.Story- The story revolves around ""The Kid"" and his quest to collect shards to save the world after the Calamity. While the story is fleshed out over the course of the game, i cant help but feel that the world isnt as interesting as I thought it would be. What i mean by this is that there is a clear beginning, middle and end, yet not any more to it. I expected to find notes or more journal types of items to help flesh out the world. It exists already to some degree in the game, but i would have liked to know more. Other than that little nit pick, I found the story to be good, but not great.Replayability - While there is a proving grounds and some wave enemy combat, I see Bastion on Campagin as a one and done type of deal. There is content to keep you interested for the better part of about 15-20 hours though. If you getting everything and doing the extra missions you should finish within that timetable. The campaign for me took between 6-8 hours. Once you get the hang of the combat it runs though pretty quickly. As a game to pick up in the future again, I say it has limited replayability.Controls - Controls are pretty straight forward and really easy to learn. I would recommend using a controller though because keybindings are on the backburner for this game. Conclusion: If you are looking to buy Bastion, do it. It is a fantastic game and well worth purchase. The only negative takeaway is that the story background  isnt fully fleshed out and the replayability factor is pretty low.Final Score: 9 out of 10 ",368,62,7,53,19,0,51

												After buying Bastion during the 2011 winter sale and playing the few minutes necessary to get the achievement for the coal-crafting metagame, I filed it away in my mental “play later” category, but never got back to it until just recently. (After all, I wouldn’t have felt quite right adding Transistor to my backlog until Bastion was done.)Honestly, it took me a fair amount of time to warm up to Bastion. The voiced aspect of the narrative didn’t hook me right away as it did for many other players - in fact, I found it somewhat distracting and stylistically difficult to follow while beating away on the baddies. The combat, while serviceable, didn’t immediately motivate me to experiment with different weapons or special abilities. As a result, I pushed through the first half of the game primarily because I like to finish the games I start, and not because I was particularly impressed with it beyond the superficial stuff.It wasn’t until all the cores were gathered up that I felt Bastion was finally starting to click with me. By that time I’d had a decent opportunity to upgrade a few different weapons, and the creature variety made me think a bit more about approaching each situation (although I certainly wouldn’t characterize any of the enemy encounters as difficult). In addition, I had put together enough of the backstory that the plot started to get interesting. Narration redeemed. After that point, I was much more motivated to play the game to completion.The soundtrack and art were superb throughout, but I don’t think there’s a lot of disagreement on that, so no need to go into any great detail there. I can’t think of any area of the game that lacked in the visuals department, although I did find that forested area with the armored frogs to be incredibly annoying.Regarding optional stuff, I didn’t spend a lot of time with it. First, I’d like to go back and try some of the idol challenges. I enabled one of the idols once, but lost interest in them when I noticed that it deactivated itself when I was done with the level. I didn’t really want to revisit the shrine between each area to keep them turned on. Second, I’m thinking about going through New Game+ after a short break (a month or two).So, short and sweet, I’d give Bastion a decent recommendation. It wasn’t among the most compelling experiences I’ve found in gaming, nor did it really live up to the level it was hyped at to me. Regardless, it’s a good game and short enough for anyone to give it a fair shake. And it was most certainly good enough to make me look forward to buying and playing Transistor at some point.

												For some reason, it took me 3 separate attempts over a few years to actually sit down and play this game all the way through. After finally finishing the game, I have to admit I'm not quite sure what held me back on my first 2 attempts because Bastion is a truly great game. It succeeds in nearly every way. Probably the most noteworthy and distinct aspects are its narration and visuals, both of which players will notice almost immediately. The narration guides along not only the story, but the gameplay as well, which - when coupled with the source of the narration - provides a more intimate and closely-felt experience. Much of the game's worldbuilding and lore is also developed through the narrator, with his very human, down-to-earth, and often heartfelt voice acting. Characters and their backstories are also developed in this way, and the story being progressed in this manner turns out to be more intricate and poignant than it would seem at first. Worldbuilding also takes place quite literally as the world is built before your eyes as you move along an area. This decision to have the setting come to life as you go does wonders for the feel of the game; it's a design choice (and in a way, a mechanic) that is entirely unique and refreshing and elevates the aesthetics of the game to another level.Also worth mentioning is Bastion's incredible soundtrack. Its varying tracks fit the moods of different moments and locations exceptionally well. The music of Bastion is instrumental (heh) in creating the right atmosphere as it complements the narration and aesthetics to make a truly powerful experience. One track in particular caught my attention the instant the female vocals rang out, and I almost stopped playing just to appreciate the chillingly beautiful song.The actual gameplay of Bastion is probably its weakest point, and that's only because the rest of the game is on another level. The gameplay is actually quite good, with satisfying combat that holds more depth than it would initially seem. It's not as amazing as Bastion's other aspects, and it doesn't really do anything new, but it works just fine for the game and still provides for a fun experience. There is also a fair amount of replayability, which is always a plus in my book.With a gorgeous soundtrack and aesthetics, solid gameplay, and top-notch narration, Bastion easily deserves its spot in the hall of fame for indie games.8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Excellent voicework, interesting design choices and great art help set this solid game apartThe usual suspects of an action game are present: you can roll, block and use a handful of weapons and customization to destroy enemies. Though that might sound like slim pickings compared to other action RPGs (specifically Diablo clones). The hammer does more damage if you aren't moving, the sword can be thrown and is speed based, etc. and there are upgrades that make so that all of the customization options can be felt. Personality is the key to this game's design. In a way, this game plays how you want it to. There is a high degree of difficulty customization (eventually, by way of ""idols"" in game), a few very important story decisions and combat customization. Alcohol acts as equipment in the game, and they can drastically alter how you play, on top of this you have special skills you can use and switch  out freely (unfortunately some of these skills are similar). If all of this sounds like an old hat, I can't stress enough how much you can change your gameplay experience: you can have enemies explode on death while you use two melee weapons for some nice reflex based challenge, or you can make your shields counter hits heal and do critical damage as you turtle along.The highlight of the game features is without a doubt the narrator. There are certain portions of the game where what you do or don't do is spoken by the narrator in that golden voice of his. I even caught myself smiling as the narrator called me out on having fallen off the ledge so many times. When you change up your weapons he will remark how that reminds him of something, or some of the items history. What is great about the narrator is that he adds more to the narrative and lore, bit by bit, and adds more personality to the game. The story is solid, it is not experimental, but is great and delivered extremely well.This game is worth your time. It is not a grand epic like any of the Elder Scrolls or a loot fest like Diablo. What you have here is an earnest gem of a game that isn't trying to be anything more than a solid action RPG.(This review needs an update)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very fun, pretty and unique, indie isometric hack-n-slash that is easy to get into. The narrator voice-over is really well done, and the graphics are sort of like beautifully hand-painted SNES-esque environments, which means I love it. Good music, too. Plus, combat is more interesting than in many other games of this type (including the Diablo series, IMO).Fun, cool and interesting. The setting is quite unique. A bizarre fantasy world of floating land-masses with a bit of old wild-west, a hint of post-apocalyptic, with some rather strange beasts. And the game's ending is surprisingly moving and thought-provoking.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I feel bad giving Bastion a thumbs down but unfortunately I just didn't enjoy it. This isn't because I think it's a bad game as it's clear why it has received so much praise, but the repetitive gameplay led me to fail in my quest to play it through. It's pretty, and the aesthetic overall is endearing and the narration too is an interesting touch, however overall it failed to grab me and make me want to see it through to the end.

												This game is really well written, I'm usually not big on plots, in fact, most of the games I have don't even have a singleplayer story mode because of that reason. However, Bastion was different for me, since the moment I began playing the game, I felt really immersed. The narrator speaking as you play is probably my favorite part of the whole game, it really makes you feel like you're part of the game and I wish more games would do the same.As for the gameplay, it's rather good as well. There are quite a few number of weapons as well as skills throughout the game making it pretty simple to develop your own style of play. The game itself is rather easy in my opinion, it only gets a tad difficult if you invoke all of the idols (Items that add various effects to monsters that make the game more difficult, but giving you extra EXP to compensate). The only part that I had some real difficulty with was the Stranger's Dream with all idols invoked, and even that only took me two attempts. However, if you have difficulty with these sort of games, there's a No-Sweat mode which allows you to continue unlimited times no matter how many times you die. Though of course, some of the achievements can't be obtained via No-Sweat mode.I'm usually not big on music in games either, but the soundtrack is also another thing to love about this masterpiece. It costs $10 to buy the soundtrack here on Steam for download, which sounds a little pricey, but I personally thought it was well worth the price. The music in the game is just amazing, and I can't get enough of it, just like the rest of the game, it's extremely well done.If you're big on achievements, like I am, the achievements in Bastion aren't too difficult, to 100% the game, all you really need is time. I estimate that it would take most people 16-18 or so hours to perfect this game, I took a little while longer since I spent a lot of time messing around in the game, it took me a little over 20 hours. Each playthrough takes roughly 6-8 hours, New Game+ should take a little less than that, though if you haven't done the dreams, those might add on a bit more time. Then you have to play Score Attack, but you only need a million points and that doesn't take the entire storyline if you do the dreams with idols invoked. There's not much else to say about this game, it has beautiful art, music, gameplay, story, and it has decent replay value. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone and everyone. I think this game is more than worth it at normal price, but it goes on sale every now and then as well, so if you really want to, waiting for it to be on sale is a pretty good option too. (Currently 40% off as I'm writing this review.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hooolllyyy mother of God, this game is amazing. I don't know what makes this game, so, awesome. After seeing the release of Transistor, I decided to review this wonderful game. I have no idea though. The narrator? Visuals? Soundtrack? Either way, I must say, I haven't played a masterpiece quite like this in such a long time. To me, it outclasses Braid, which, for some odd reason, is used to compare Bastion, but don't have much in common. Man, where to begin...I guess I'll start with the visuals. The art in this game is absolutely amazing. It was done extremely, extremely well. Everything was painted beautifully, and I can't help but love everything about it. It makes you feel like an adventurer. You're curious to explore and willing to take risks. You just can't help but stop, take in all of the scenery, and realize you spent an hour staring at the visuals. All of it is wonderful, and if you mix it with the soundtrack, oh man. Ohmanohmanohman!Soundtrack is next. It's kinda hard to admit, but after drooling over the Super Meat Boy and Faster Than Light soundtracks, these songs will make you drool out a waterfall. Before you know it, you'll have created the ""Drool Ocean,"" which covers all of Earth. It's just that amazing. Just go on Bandcamp, iTunes, Youtube, whatever. I swear to GOD, you will start loving that soundtrack.Now for the best part of this game: The narration. One player, dunno if it was Steam, but I remember him saying this: ""His voice is velvet silk on this wonderful game"" or something along those lines. I'm a madman, I know. But this narrator makes me think of Morgan Freeman. I don't know why, but he does. To me, this guy might just be the Morgan Freeman of gaming, no joke. He's a god. He speaks with more emotion than most AAA characters, heroes, villains, etc etc COMBINED. If you never heard his voice. PLEASE. I'm BEGGING YOU. PLEASE look him up on Youtube. Last but not least, the gameplay and replayability. The gameplay is simple, hack and slash controls. It's simple, but a little bland, and I admit, this is probably the weakpoint of the game. The difficulty is very easy, and I have no difficulty fighting enemies, even with the shrines. The weakweakpoint of this game, yes, weakweakpoint, is the length. You can easily beat the game in a few hours. I'm about to finish my first playthrough already! It's that short. However, the game is pretty replayable, so that's a good thing. You have about 20 hours or so of fun for this game.Graphics- 10/10Gameplay- 6/10Story- 7/10Audio- 10/10Replayability- 7/10**GANDHI GAMING PERSONAL PICK**.:9.0/10:.+Wonderful narrator+Amazing visuals+GODLY soundtrack+Has some replayability+Lots of emotion+Interesting characters-Short-Dull gameplay			",150,23,0,20,8,2,12

												One of the first indies bundles I bought featured this game. I had no idea what I was getting into, nor how amazing this game was going to be. In reality it turned out to be nothing short of a masterpiece. If you ever manage to have the opportunity to play this game, do so! You will be treated to a rare experience, not easily found in the gaming industry. Few games accomplish what Bastion has done.Bastion is an action-RPG, the first of two games developed by Supergiant Games, their second and most recent being Transistor. While they are both amazing games, and both equally worthy of praise, this review is all about Bastion. If Bastion and Transistor are anything to go off of, then we can expect great things in the future from this developer! Bastion puts you in the role of the Kid, as he fights to uncover the secrets of ""the Calamity"", an earthshattering catastrophe that leaves the world in pieces. Bastion redefines storytelling, with reactive narration and superb voiceover work - simply playing the game and listening to the narrator is a joy in and of itself. The game also features a critically-acclaimed soundtrack, which is available for purchase along with the game.The controls are extremely easy to use and get used to. Bastion features the typical but tried-and-true method of using the WASD keys for movement commonly found in many game, along with point and click input for combat. The direction you move the cursor is the direction the Kid will attack when you click. Left clicking uses your main weapon, which is more often than not a melee weapon, such as a hammer or machete; while right clicking is generally a ranged weapon, such as a bow or gun. Holding down either mouse button for a brief period unleashes a charge attack, dealing more damage than usual. Spacebar causes the Kid to roll in the direction of your cursor, allowing you to dodge most attacks. Some enemies have the ability to knock you into the air, at which point you have the opportunity to perform an air recovery by hitting the Spacebar.There are many varied, handpainted environments, each crawling with savage creatures hell-bent on putting an end to your arduous journey. At your disposal is an array of different weapons and abilities, which are all upgradeable as the player progresses through the game. Also available is an assortment of Spirits, which grant various passive bonuses, such as an increase in Max HP, or increased critical hit chance. The game also has a New Game Plus mode, where you can replay the story carrying over all the items from your previous playthrough.From an enthralling story told through superb narrative, to lush, detailed environments and deadly enemies, Bastion has everything you could want from an indie RPG. It's definitely worth adding to any game collection. It's the kind of game that will turn anyone into a gamer.A Must Play ",1536,601,45,246,160,15,221

												This is another example of ""Gaming as Art"".The most famous feature is the narration of Logan Cunningham, ""the man with the buttery voice"", and narrates your every move giving you comfort and fun while playing.The art style is beautiful, with levels that literally build while playing. The colors are vibrant and every screenshot you take could easily be a painting.The combat is as intuitive as it gets: to three buttons corresponds a different weapon. I strongly recommend a controller, though.Overall, this is a great indie game that won't be forgotten. A must buy.SCORE: 94/100			",532,126,11,40,24,4,34

												Bastion is visually stunning game with a clear and crisp art style that quickly makes you forget this was indie developed. The sound is equally impressive, with an array of well chosen musical tracks and one of the best narrator's I've ever encounter.As you play through the game various actions and events are narrated by Ruck, one of the few survivors other than yourself in this colorful post-apocalyptic world. His smooth and soothing voice might be a gimmick but it sure as hell adds character to the game and lets you feel less alone when grinding through the hordes of enemies you encounter.The gameplay itself is a fairly basic Diablo clone. You can carry two weapons at any time and got the option of using a special attack every once in a while and that's about it. Most of the more difficult challenges are about learning dodge and block timing rather than complicated attack moves.It is a fun and cute little game and definitely one of the best indie games of the year.

												Bastion brings you in as The Kid. One of the few survivors to the Calamity in the world of Caelondia. Travel the world (levels) to find the cores and shards the were left in the aftermath of the disaster to bring back to life The Bastion. The beauty and color that this game brings with the deep system of ugrades and different weapons offers a kind of RPG to mind. This has been one of the most beautiful, creative and luscious games that I have ever played, seen and heard since I have started gaming. Even with its downfall of being a bit short, its story is so well played out that you will play it to experience it at least twice.Pros: Beautiful, colorful, creative, different.Cons: short (even though this doesnt mean this makes it anything less than a good game.)9/10			",165,79,1,15,31,0,7

												I listened to Bastion's soundtrack way before I sat down and played through the game itself. I'm glad that the game is just as enchanting as its music. Bastion is one big errand mission as you travel through the skies to find the essential pieces needed to rebuild the Bastion--the hub world you escaped to when the world was nearly destroyed by a 'calamity.' I don't mean to tear down Bastion, as it's a fun game that I thoroughly enjoyed. The only unfortunate thing about such a straightforward task is that it can't go on too long before it gets old, which the developers must have realized as they kept the game at a perfect length. Bastion offers several weapons that you can hold in any combination. You can also upgrade them with abilities that strengthen their unique attributes--meaning most people are going to have different setups by the time they reach the climax of the game. I had a lot of fun messing around with different combinations to see which weapons best fit my playstyle. To top it off, you can also use different 'tonics' to give yourself a boost via an assortment of perks. Once you're finished with your customization the gameplay is solid. Blocking, attacking and rolling all feel great and you feel like a pro after a few minutes messing with the controls. The story is intriguing, but I'm going to leave it at that since I could easily give something of the plt away. If you're hoping for a deep, fulfilling story, you'll certainly find it here. I can say that the narration of 'the stranger' is one of my favorite parts of the game. I thought I would grow tired of his constant talking as I fought through and explored the world, but it's well done and never overbearing. Overall, you should definitely pick this one up if you want a fun adventure with a great story and stellar soundtrack.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fun and beautiful, with excellent soundtrack. There are many different weapons so the gameplay has got plenty of variety, and extra missions to learn more about the backstory of the characters.One flaw is that you only have one save file, and it saves automatically to boot. While admittedly it makes sense story-wise (the story is all about moving forward rather than trying to correct past mistakes), it's extremely annoying gameplay-wise.Also, it can be annoying that the story is so vague about the way the Calamity affected the world. We quickly learn how it affected two countries (and even then the long-term survival of one of the two is left up in the air), but unless the whole world was only made of those two countries (heck, could be, they never say) it's pretty weird that there is never even a hint about what the rest of the world is doing. The game focuses exclusively on the protagonists at the expense of world building.Even so, overall it's most definitely a game worth playing.			",76,99,2,8,3,0,8

												Whenever I want to play a GOOD game, and get tired of the generic games out there,  I re-install this game. I have cleared it 4 times already, and I would do it again if I wasn't this god-damn lazy. It's going to sound like complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to most of you, but I do think, that this game is the one that got most close to perfection. And I ain't joking arround here. I usually talk about the BAD parts of a game first, in the reviews, but I just can't find anything bad about it. It's not THAT long, but it's cheap, and has replayability, New Game+ and some extreme challenges. The enemies never feel cheap or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly programmed. The world is well-crafted. The soundtrack is as perfect as it's narrator, who is, at this point, the Morgan Freeman of video-f#cking-games. It also has a good amount of weapons, skills, combinations... What's bad about it!? The only bad thing, is that the ""plot-twist"" can be a bit obvious. THAT'S IT. And that's the only thing that makes this game unworthy of getting a 10/10. But you know what? Who needs perfection, when you can get so near, it doesn't even matter.Bastion starts with ""Kid"", a young buy who's drifting in a world of lego that's being undone day by day. Uppon leaving what used to be the walls of the city, he joins the narrator, Rucks, and some other people later on. The ""Bastion"" works as your hub, and you rebuild it, adding a place to hold and change your equipment, to hold your liquor (seriously, the Kid is like 12 years old, SHAME ON YOU, RUCKS), or even pray to the golds, to make the game unholy-f#cking-hard. There are also, like I said, a bunch of challenges, in either pictures that will unlock by doing special stuff like killing multiple enemies with an arrow, or in special arenas where you have to fight and fight to survive, from waves and waves of enemies, while the dream (or rather, the arena of the dream) falls apart, while you get to learn more lore about the game.The soundtrack is just perfect. The songs with lyrics are just beautiful. The narrator makes a perfect job to narrate the game, not like in other games, where he just would spam selected audio files, but in here, he DOES narrate what you do.  You fall down a pit? He makes a comment about it? You forget about enemies, and start smashing down things on the map? He will also talk about it. He will even comment how nasty and over-powered your loadout is (try to carry the grenade-launcher with the Bazooka, the line cracks me up every god-damn time).The gameplay is as solid, as the snake on my pants. I wasn't trying to reference Metal Gear, that crap just happens. You can equip two weapons, and a skill of either of them. You can also upgrade your weapons, and at times, you can choose what to upgrade. You want the rifle to load faster, or to pierce enemies? Your choice. But with the amout of weapons, you sure can go whoever you feel like, and enjoy the game.Oh, and if you didn't know, after playing the game, and going New Game+, you can get the skill to summon Portal Turrets. Seriously. That just blows my mind how much they managed to make futuristic turrets that talk fit so well in the game. Those guys are a bunch of geniuses, and they deserve your money for making this piece of digital art. It also has multiple endings, and the key moments of the game can seriously reach deep into you. Well, not in me, I'm too much of a man, but it sure was close.I give this game a Super Saiyan Morgan Freeman / 10, now buy it before he fuses with Samuel L. Jackson.			",167,20,8,24,14,4,23

												Oh my gracious sauce, it is time to review Bastion.Let's first begin by talking about the gameplay. While it is not extraordinary, it is very solid and I enjoyed it like I enjoy a rich potato salad.  You can carry two weapons in your main loadout as well as one special move or skill. As you progress through the game you will find more weapons and your options will increase dramatically.  Experimenting with the different weapons to find the playstyle you like best is great fun. There is also an upgrade system for these weapons which allows you to experiment even further. All super sauce.You play through many different levels as you defeat enemies and collect shards.  This is where the great visuals are shown off.  They are crazy delicious. Ridiculously good. They did great work on the art style of this game and it pays off.  The music is also fantastic. The biggest flaw of Bastion is that the main game is shorter than most. However, the replay value is boosted by optional challenges and endurance tests.  The difficulty level is also quite tame, but they allow the player to make the game harder and recieve more EXP by playing on harder difficulties.  It is up to the player to add more pasta sauce to the game if the length and difficulty do not satisfy.What I believe to be the most defining part of Bastion is the narrator who narrates all that the main character does in the game as you control him.  It is a very unique and fresh idea that made me say ""Holy iguana lungs, this idea is pretty sauce!"". The voice actor for the narrator is also excellent and his voice is quite godlike and very fitting.Overall, this game is definitely a slam dunk worthy of a top 10 special on ESPN.  The music, the art style, the narration, the story, and the gameplay are all as professional as a broadway musical. I have awarded Bastion a rating of ""5/5 top notch godlike"".  Thank you for reading my review.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When i first encountered this game, I fell for the artistic side of it. After an hour or so I got a bit bored, but pushing through that hour was worth it. The deeper you dig into this game the more skill is required. A good game for a completionist, but a super pretty visual experience and a good story for the regular gamer.  8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It was waiting on the top of my wishlist for quite a while. It kept winking at me every time I checked my wishlist and I knew I'd eventually get it, for sure. Then it finally got hit by one of Steam's big sales, and I snatched it. Bastion. Not only it's a fun Hack & Slash RPG to play, but the story-telling is fresh, unique and full of magic, so much that I can't shake it. I could go rambling on and on like the narrator all day long. Or at least for a while... :PYou get quite a choice of weapons to use, the graphics are cool, the controls are very intuitive, the story is interesting, and the presentation? Well, like I said - it has its own twist and it works really well. If you like Action RPGs, you simply can't afford not trying Bastion.			",233,98,1,103,60,0,70

												An amazing game with a great narrated story and incredible soundtrack.Tons of ways to change your loadout combination to appeal to a large variety of playstyles. Weapon upgrades change how they behave making a single weapon extremely versatile. Without giving too much away, other buildings in the Bastion allow for greater gameplay modification such as passive abilities, and difficulty enhancers.The artwork is stunning and fits the game really well.Bastion is a bit of an emotional roller coaster that will have you coming back for a second ride. After you beat the game you get the option to start ""New Game+"" which lets you take all your unlocked goodies to the start of a new playthrough.PRO TIP: It's not considered crying if you wipe away the tears fast enough.

												I first played this game 18 months ago and wasn't that into it. Certainly I was impressed by its drawing style and the touching voice by Logan Cunningham. But the game play, mostly smashing things all around, didn't interest me too much so I abandoned half way through the story line.A couple days ago when checking my library looking for something to play, I saw this game sitting in my library and I figured it wouldn't be a bad idea to continue from the save of last year's summer.And it was fun. Real fun. The game play is actually very interesting.You can choose two weapons to equip from a total of 12 and a secret skill. Some secret skill are weapon-specific while the others are general. There are also upgrades to weapons once you get the required material and money, which is called fragment in the Bastion. Bethesda really should have taken a page from Supergiant for Skyrim's battle system.This game is suitable for both casual and hardcore gamers. For casual gamers there is a No-Sweat mode that allows infinite continues in exchange for inability to earn some achievements. The main story line only takes about 3 hours to finish on the first run. While for hardcore gamers, there are New Game+ and Score Attack modes, both of which are required if you want to get 100% of the achievements.As a side note, the achievements are really well-designed that you earn as few as 5 out of the 24 achievements if you finish the game in story mode. The pursuit of the remaining 19, is truly the essence of this game.			",337,119,2,42,43,6,69

												I've been listening to the soundtrack on-and-off for a few years all while the game sat in my pile'o'shame. By turns it's haunting and jaunty, rallying and soulful. The Narrator's voice appears in it a few times and I'd always marvelled at the presence this character held.When I finally got around to playing through the game and found it addictive and evocative. The maps and scenery are beautiful in their simplicity. At times they get a bit busy and it can be hard to follow your character (even outside the jungle area) or avoid falling into oblivion but those are minor gripes for such a gorgeous playground.The controls are both simple to grasp and difficult to master, especially countering attacks with perfect timing. This makes for an excellent difficulty curve and I felt a keen sense of accomplishment every time I was able to take down enemies with their own attacks. This couples well with the customisation available in the game, picking good weapons and making sure they're modified to your playstyle - and to complement each other - will make or break your chances of finishing.The storytelling is simply done, a running commentary provided by The Narrator as you progress through the game. My only gripe is sometimes this feels secondary to the action and you can lose attachment to the story. As heartwrenching as some of it is I felt more loss from the death of the animals I'd collected.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bastion is an amazing game with stunning graphics and soothing narration. Gameplay is pretty versatile. You can choose between a close-range, mid-range, or far-range weapon through each mission. Certain weapons let you double up on close and far range but using it is up to your preference. The music is alright but the narration, however, is music to the ears. Best part about the game is having creatures that can potentially kill you as pets. Also, you have a mailbox at the Bastion which is always empty because, get it, everyone's dead. Your roommates are basically an old man with a godly voice, a harp-player, and a backstabber. Besides them, there's really no one friendly around to give you their regards.			",32,12,0,9,0,0,2

												I heard a lot of hype for this game before I tried it.  Usually I'm wary of such games, as it's difficult to live up to so many high expectations.  I'm glad to report that this is one of those rare circumstances where a game not only lives up to its hype, but exceeds it.  Bastion is an action RPG with the gimmick of a real-time narrator.  The story is quite good, but the variations in combat are really what shine with Bastion.  Multiple weapons and weapon pairings allow you to play this game as you choose, and also allow for different playthroughs each time you approach this game.  Add in one of the best video game soundtracks I've heard in a long time, and you have a complete package.  Bastion is one of the few games that upon completion I fired it up again to play it from the start.  I would give this game an outstanding 9.5/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Amazing Gameplay, Suffering StoryGorgeous, hand-rendered art utilizing creative, luscious settings and vibrant colors to set the mood. Fun and unique gameplay coupled with a beautiful and memorable soundtrack. There is a lot to love about this visually arresting game. As fantastic as Bastion is, there were a few things I had problems with in terms of storytelling.They touched on some sensitive subjects that could have worked well with the story but fell a little short. Basic gist (spoilers abound): Group #1 is part of a community that historically committed atrocities upon a rival community, Group #2. Group #1's resolution to make peace with Group #2 and right wrongs was to...kill a bunch of people from Group #2 and cause more destruction to their home. The narrative was written in a way that everything that happened to Group #2 was self-inflicted, despite it being the player character's fault. That part could have been removed and the story wouldn't have suffered.The mechanics, art direction, and soundtrack is what makes this game great. The story itself is told over and over again in movies and shows time and time again; a group seeks power by destroying and the oppressed is (rightfully) angry and seeks to avenge their own. No justice is served for the oppressed group and, by the end, it really feels like the game was saying ""it was their own undoing"" which is morally wrong. It had a lot of potential to tell a deeper story, possibly one of redemption, but they dropped the ball on that.6/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bastion was not award winning by accident.Neither for promotion purposes.I have seen games getting rewards for no reason in the past, in order to sell better. That's why i hate seen video game companies as sponsors on events.Anyway.Bastion is an indie game.It is made by people who have BRILLIANT ideas, that putting them together create a great story.It is made by people who are BRILLIANT graphics artists.Is is made by people who are BRILLIANT musicians.Now what is Bastion? It is an action RPG.How do they promote it? As an action RPG.Good.What does an Action RPG need?Good graphics?Yeah Bastion got that.Awesome music maybe?Yup it's got that too.Incredible gameplay?Sure! It is vital! Bastion got it!Does it need great atmosphere and balance?Yes! And Bastion has both.But what is the MOST important part? STORY!And a good director i guess.Does Bastion have them? Hell yeah!Bastion is not only a video game. It is an experience everyone must have in my opinion.The game is ridiculously perfect!I give it a 90/100 for ONLY one reason. It isn't VERY big.But it is a hell of a game.Congratulations. ",139,54,4,16,10,1,22

												 ...It's just a beautiful package for the senses+ Art style+ Sound design+ Combat variation- Rather short (took me 6 hours)- Can feel slightly repetitiveThe game is beautiful, maybe one of the best looking games I've played. It's graphical beauty is matched by the sound design, it's some of the best voice talent/soundtrack I've heard in a game. It's just a beautiful package for the senses but it also plays pretty well with a varied combat system, allowing you to play as you want. It took me a little while to get into the story but I became curious about the origins of the event in the game, so much so I found it difficult to put the controller down. It's length is a little meagre but offers replayability through a 'new game plus' mode in which your levels, exp and equipment carry over which allows you to play it differently and also a different ending.If you're into action RPGs, you should give it a go.

The gameplay, the visual design, the soundtrack, the plot, the characters and how everything comes together and develops as you play it, makes it really unique and special.Without much discussion, this is one of the best games I've ever played in my life, I liked it so much that I completed again in 3 days, one of the few games that made ​​me spend more than 2 hours straight playing (4 actually).The plot is very good and well done, the way it is presented to you, with a narrator telling and detailing aspects of the story all the time. It also has one of the best soundtracks, some songs are so good that sometimes I stopped playing just to listen to them. The art work is amazingly beautiful and well done. And the gameplay is kinda oldschool, remember Zelda, but without many puzzles, it's fun and challenging from beginning to end. Also the ending is brilliant.I recommend everyone to play, is one of those games that any true gamer should play at least once.9/10			",237,47,12,43,21,2,57

												Absolutely amazing indie game. The art, the animation, the voice acting, the music: All very good and fit the game quite well. The story is a little strange, but it's interesting how it and the world unfolds (literally). The gameplay is no slouch either. While simple, it's quite enjoyable and fun all around. There's quite a few pretty cool weapons to find and upgrade throughout the game. The game isn't exactly hard, but through the use of one of the buildings at the Bastion, you can invoke different Deities to enhance the enemies to make them stronger in some way - regenerating health, more damaging, move faster, explode on death, etc.I would honestly say this is a ""must play"" for anybody who enjoys platformers, indie or not. The quality on this game is so high and everything is polished beyond most normal games that you may as well forget it's indie. I am very much looking foward to these guys' next game, Transisitor.

												   Bastion is one of the best games I have ever played. The mechanics work well, combat and movement is fluid, the game isn't too punishing, and if you took what makes it special away, it would still be a fantastic game.    What makes it stand out is the narration and story. I have never in my life heard a narrator as beautiful as this one. It doesn't interfere with gameplay, and adds to the enviroment. The story is wonderfully crafted, works with the enviroment, the art is beautiful. The ending is a texbook 'what to do'. I'll try not to spoil it, but it's the kind that makes you think about what you've done, and are about to do.   If Supergiant games can continue making masterpieces like this, Valve may be booted to my second favorite publisher.			",77,29,1,4,8,0,15

												This game is simply gorgeous in every way. The amazingly colorful watercolor aesthetics give it a unique look (seriously, the artwork for this game is freaking gorgeous), the narrative is immersive and engaging (and absolutely heartbreaking at times), the way the story is told through interactive voiceover is nothing short of wonderfully clever. Gameplay-wise, it's a lot of fun, fast-paced and well-developed. The game makes you care deeply about the characters, too, and you end up feeling not only for your protagonist and his allies, but for your foes as well; you get to experience the loneliness and the longing for the old world felt by all who survived the Calamity. Also, the music is absolutely brilliant, it makes you experience a whole range of emotions, from nostalgia to hopefulness, from sadness to joy. All in all, Bastion is an amazing experience that I would recommend to virtually anyone.			",47,21,0,10,0,0,5

												There isn't much I can say about Bastion that hasn't been said already. The art is pretty, the music wonderful and the narrator amazing. You play as the Kid, trying to find out what happened to your world which suddenly crumbled into pieces in an event called the Calamity. Along the way you meet a couple of other survivors and gather them at the bastion, a flying fortress that has the power to make everything right again. The NG+ is useful if you want to see both endings of the game because there is only one automatic save slot and the no sweat mode was a salvation for me ( I died more times by falling off the edge than by actual monsters - except perhaps the pesky anklegators).TL;DR: Play this game if : You love clicking your mouse. You love stalker narrators with raspy voices. You like falling off cliff edges and dying. You are a masochist with all 10 shrine idols invoked for impossible-to-beat who-knows-wheres. Even if you don't like any of these things, play this game. It's brilliant.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The gameplay is enjoyable and the audiovisuals are nice. I recommend getting it cheaply on a sale, but it's definitely not worth the full price.			",390,117,27,79,52,1,87

												The game is still stunning in both its art direction and writing. Gameplay is fun and varied, and there are many different experiences to be had throughout. It’s also nice to once again see the game that laid the foundation for Transistor‘s presentation and mechanics.			",109,9,3,4,1,1,1

												If there's anything I can say about Bastion, it's that it looks absolutely beautiful. The art style just blew me away, and it was admittedly the reason I got this game in the first place. But of course, good looks aren't the only thing Bastion has going for it. The combat style is very enjoyable due to the variety of customisations available, especially as you progress further into the game and unlock more weapons and potions, which affect your character's base stats. For those looking for a challenge, the interesting gameplay mechanic of invoking idol statues of gods further increases the difficulty of combat, with extra XP and money rewards. But the most interesting thing about this game for me was the fact that you're accompanied by a deep-voiced narrator, telling you the story as you play through Bastion. Whenever you progress through the story, whether it's finding a new ability, walking into a new area, or even falling off the edge, the narrator will have something to comment about it right as it happens, more often witty than not. The live narration very effectively immerses the you in the game, making you feel as if you are part of the story itself. I have never seen a game do this kind of narration before, so it was a new and often amusing experience for me.Despite how great this game is, there is one thing I'd like to point out, and that is the game's lack of definitive area borders, making it very easy to fall off ledges sometimes. For example, there would be something like a chunk of land that you think you can walk on, but when you walk over to it, it was actually in the background and so you end up falling off the ledge. This was a bit annoying particularly when I was low on health, but it's not a huge problem I would deduct any theoretical points for.With a compelling story, great soundtrack and amazing art, I thoroughly enjoyed playing Bastion and wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good adventure RPG.

												I can say that this is one of the best games I have played in my entire life. It does so much right. The gameplay is a lot of fun, although simple. But the strongest points of the game lie in its artistic and emotional values.Bastion just looks beautiful. The graphics are hand-painted, and the colours are really well done. It almost makes every screen of the game looks like a real painting, but a lot of things on screen can be destroyed or interacted with. Your character and the NPCs look a bit more 3D, with maybe a little bit of cell-shading on it too. It makes them stand out, but it still fits really well with the 2D painted background.The music is also amazing. There are a couple of songs in the soundtrack that still make me a little emotional when I hear them, just because of how they were used in this game. One of the later moments in the game is one of the strongest moments I've ever experienced in a video game, and the song that was playing at that moment was an important part of that.The story seems pretty simple when the game starts out. But as you progress, you will find out more about the world and its people before the Calamity, and what the Calamity is and what caused it. The Bastion is pretty much the only thing left that can save the world from the Calamity, and you need to travel to different areas in the world to recover cores, which power the Bastion. It's also narrated by a great voice actor, who occasionally foreshadows things that are about to happen, and interacts with you about saying something specific to what you're doing at that moment. The world in Bastion is built up with some simple themes and ideas, but at the same it feels so real and deep, if you pay enough attention to the story and understand everything about it.Even though it felt like the gameplay was one of the game's minor focuses, it was still solid and fun. There are plenty of weapons for you to use, and you always have a primary and secondary weapon with you, together with a secret ability. Each weapon has five upgrades, which you can apply if you have enough fragments (currency) and upgrade materials. Each character level-up brings along an extra slot in which you can equip a liquor that gives you a passive bonus. You can also invoke shrines to customize the game's challenge. Each God has their own shrine, and invoking it will make the game more challenging in a specific way. One would, for example, grant enemies health regeneration, while another one makes them drop a bomb when they die. Each invoked shrine increases the experience and fragments you earn by 5%.I've played through this game about four times now, and I still enjoyed every minute of it. After playing through it, you can move on to NG+, with all your equipment and character level from the previous playthrough, to unlock the alternate ending. After that you can try score attack mode, or play arenas through the form of dreams of the survivors you rescued and brought to the Bastion. The game is not that long, but it's such a wonderful experience.			",596,93,33,41,22,8,27

												Bastion is Supergiant Games’ debut title and oh what a debut it is. It has pretty simple combat. There is a variety of weapons, tonics that can gives you buffs and a basic but effective counter/dodge system. What really sets Bastion apart as a debut is the art direction and storytelling. Bastion has the most wonderful soulful and soothing narration, incredible and varied music and beautiful hand painted scenery that I've ever seen in a game.To anyone that says games can't be judged as art, play Bastion and I swear it will change your opinion completely.

												Bastion will forever live as one of the best games I have ever played. With a beautiful art and animation direction surrounded by a glorious and trully brilliant score, sound, and narration, Bastion grips the senses from the very moment you wake in a ruined floating city. As the entire experience is brought together with a powerful and driven story with unforgettable characters, it undoubtedly stands as a groundbreaking isometric role-playing game and an impressive debut game from Supergiant Games.	Not only does the main story impress, but every weapon training level provides an entirely different style of combat not only with the respective represented weapon but the very grounds upon where you must prove your tactical prowess is carefully crafted and detailed to offer an eye-catching and grip-tightening hold on the challenger. Similarly, the four trips to Who-Knows-Where pit you against wave after wave of enemies to test one beyond their normal gaming limits and bring one to a peak of their reaction-timing and accuracy mastery. Bastion includes 24 Steam Achievements that will each take the player to the edge of their gaming ability and focus. It will most certainly build a better gamer out of you. Bastion is absolute gaming perfection. 	With every brutally powerful enemy and cryptically beautiful scene, The Kid must traverse a broken sky for the materials needed to bring life back to his dying city of Caelondia and undo the damage wrought by The Calamity. As The Kid travels, he'll discover more than he bargained for surviving in vicious wildernesses, salvaged from fractured villages, and sacrificed to melted mountains. He'll face beasts of the wild, the warriors of The Ura, and even be tested by gods above to save the very fabric of reality, all the while unravelling the secrets of not only the city's fate, but his own past as well as his future.

												Bastion is a beautiful game. The game play flows well, very intuitive, the soundtrack is beautiful, and the artwork is gorgeous. Think a pretty version of Diablo. You hack and slash your way through amazingly well fleshed out environments and are able to customize the upgrades your weapons. The music is amazing, so I'd recommend buying the version with the soundtrack included. The narrator has a rich, smooth, cowboy voice and the storyline is intriguing. It's never boring, and although the enemies don't have many variety, the colorful worlds bring this game to life. I played this on a PC and had no troubles with the controls what so ever. This game is not easy however. You can however chose to have unlimited amounts of lives which helps greatly, especially when you don't care to dodge or block any of the attacks being tossed your way. Great game. 9/10			",165,106,8,26,37,3,19

												Bastion is a very stylized isometric action game in which you play a young character who finds himself awaken shortly after the apocalypse. As you explore, the world fills in around you. Over the course of the game, you pick up a variety of weapons, powers, abilities, and even penalties you can equip to give yourself better rewards, all while working your way through the areas and story.Bastion's strengths are three main areas: first, how it tells the story. The actions of the player are narrated by a fantastic voice actor, providing a feeling of having the tale be told as you play it out, which is very unique among games. Secondly, it has an amazing soundtrack, which I don't know exactly how to describe - maybe Electronic Folk? Anyway, it absolutely has one of the best soundtracks of any game I've ever played. Finally, the story itself, which I obviously don't want to spoil in the review, so I'll leave you to that.There's a fair amount of replayability and challenges to complete if the player is so inclined - I personally chose to play through once and enjoyed it as that. At any rate, the most important thing is this: buy this game, and when you do, buy the soundtrack.			",499,185,8,84,55,5,102

												This game is like a game i have been recently been playing called Darkest dungeon. Like the game, Bastion delivers an atmospheric experience whose story, music and design all emerse me in a great world with everything fitting together so well. This game should be applauded for how well of an experience it gives the player as it dripfeeds you weapons, story and enemies to fight. The only real thing i can fault is the gameplay, which is pretty linear and has no real replay value. However if thats the biggest thing im complaining about, then i have nothing much to complain about.This game is worth every cent. It basically made narration in games popular.			",84,14,0,3,2,0,1

You get used to it quickly, and it's an excellent tool to move the story.And the story itself is outstanding ---- set up comes in the middle of events and go from there, filling in as needed.Gameplay is easy to understand for the casual player even though there are plenty of challenges and complex tasks to master.Artwork is gorgeous, music is great, and controls are easy.It's been around for a good while, and is on sale often ---- pick it up then, if you haven't already.

												Super nice game. I was bored one day and saw it in my inventory, launched it - and was not bored anymore. Once you finished the game you can replay the story while keeping all unlocked weapons and skills. It's also one of the few games I was looking forward to replay. The game begins really easy but becomes more and more difficult. If you still feel like the game was too easy to beat you can try out the challenge missions and give the enemies perks that make them far more dangerous. I really recommend everyone to give this game a try. Now with the Summer Sale coming it should be 75% off again.			",476,202,22,46,41,8,78

												Bastion is a memorable experience that transcends its parts.Gameplay is typical ARPG, with lots of weapons upgrading. This game gives you about a dozen melee and ranged weapons to choose from. Too many to upgrade them all fully, but it does mean that you can select weapons that match your preferred style of gameplay, and upgrade them with effects that you prefer (knockback, damage over time, crits, etc.). This is all very intuitive. But the gameplay itself is dull and repetitive.What makes Bastion work, though, is what's happening when you're not blasting, pounding, or burning alien critters. The just-in-time narration is excellent, and teeters between over-the-top seriousness and great dry humor. This narration that comes as you need it, mid-gameplay, works wonderfully and much better than cutscenes. There is a lesson here for other games.There is a compelling story here that takes effort and attention to comprehend. You have to continue past the main game into other modes to get the full story, or just look it up on Google when you're done. I frankly found the story to be a bit too abstruse to keep track of. I never developed too much interest in the characters who may not be what they say they are, or may be betraying you or not, or ... whatever. Blah blah blah. But the way the story is plugged directly into the gameplay via clever narration, gives you some very memorable experiences. No spoilers here, you'll have to trust me.I can't not mention the soundtrack. It's an excellent mash-up of old-West and Far-east, with electric drum beats and a stellar blues number thrown in for good measure. It reminds me of the old-West sci-fi soundtrack that accompanied the TV show ""Firefly"". There is no denying the spiritual influence. Listening to the song ""In case of Trouble"", I see scenes from Firefly in my head. This complete soundtrack stands alone wonderfully; my only wish would be for more vocal numbers, because ""Build That Wall"" is so moving when it's presented in the game.In summary, Bastion works because the whole is far greater and more memorable than its parts. Each element of this game augments the others - the average gameplay is elevated by the narration and the always-appropriate soundtrack, and the story that I struggled to care about still gave me chills and a jaw-dropping experience near the end, fueled by a sudden change in the gameplay and the always-appropriate soundtrack. Bastion is, most of all, a COMPLETE game experience, with a start, a middle, and an ending, where each element was clearly planned and thoughtfully executed, with polish and shine. Compare this to most games that simply end with a boss fight and a tacked on cut scene that explains what happened and teases a sequel, and you'll appreciate what a rare bird Bastion is in today's game market. Whether or not this particular title works for you, I hope you will agree with me that we need more games like Bastion. ",168,52,2,18,21,2,22

												I was gifted Bastion by a friend a few years ago. WHY DIDN'T I PLAY IT UNTIL NOW??? IT'S SO MUCH FUN!!!Wow. I haven't enjoyed a game this much in a long time. The story is great, the visuals are beautiful and colorful. The whole atmosphere is really lovely. The music is so good and it is fluid in that you can flow from one mood to another easily when the narration changes, you enter a specific area on the map, etc.But what really keeps me coming back is the combat. I don't usually love hack'n'slash, but these weapons & abilities are SO much fun to use. I love all of them, too bad you can only use two at a time. The option of using spirits and idols to make the combat easier/harder depending on different variables you can choose to control is just brilliant. And the eventual upgrades you get, are awesome. The (increasingly difficult) maps & monsters are all introduced at a good, flowing pace, and in the end are all super fun to fight. I'm probably going to keep playing and toy with the difficulty and different weapon combinations for a while, even after I've beat New Game Plus.I was very motivated by the narrator and other rewarding, and interesting parts of the game to keep on playing and complete the story. Too often I don't finish games, but the Bastion called my name every hour of the day since I began playing. Even after you've completed the story there's still more stuff that you can do. Or, rather you can do other fun things while taking your time with the story. It's cool. The currency, and the rate at which it is acquired, is really in sync with natural progression. Everything about this game is just, ""in sync"". It flows. It makes sense. Nothing worried me about it. It is most excellently designed.Whoever came up with the idea to introduce New Game Plus after you've beat it the first time, knew how important that feature would be for people like me who couldn't get enough and wanted to keep playing.So, you should get this game. It's really perfect, especially if you like rpg's, this is a special one. There's really no way you wouldn't enjoy it, unless you have real poor coordination and fall off the map all the time (but this is just another fun thing about it). Also. Most of the world is destructible so that's fun (it's so pretty though, why would you want to do that? Maybe to make more room for fighting monsters, or getting past obstacles...) So much fun. Get it!			",156,119,0,27,17,0,25

												This game is wonderful. It has a great soundtrack, but what really makes it is the narrator, who speaks throughout the game and gives the story a great deal of impact. How can an empty world have a story? You'll find out by playing this game.The gameplay is only okay, but as a part of the greater package that is this game, you'll love it. Probably the second or third best game of 2011, without even needing to add the qualifier of ""indie game"" - it is better than virtually all AAA titles.			",507,173,10,70,51,7,84

												Super nice game. I was bored one day and saw it in my inventory, launched it - and was not bored anymore. Once you finished the game you can replay the story while keeping all unlocked weapons and skills. It's also one of the few games I was looking forward to replay. The game begins really easy but becomes more and more difficult. If you still feel like the game was too easy to beat you can try out the challenge missions and give the enemies perks that make them far more dangerous. I really recommend everyone to give this game a try. Now with the Summer Sale coming it should be 75% off again.			",476,202,22,46,41,8,78

The way in which the narrator engages and tells the story makes it seamless and just better than in any other game I have played, no need for extended cutscenes or other gameplay interuptions.This combined with great music and artstyle makes it into a game you should definitely not miss.

												Bastion is a memorable experience that transcends its parts.Gameplay is typical ARPG, with lots of weapons upgrading. This game gives you about a dozen melee and ranged weapons to choose from. Too many to upgrade them all fully, but it does mean that you can select weapons that match your preferred style of gameplay, and upgrade them with effects that you prefer (knockback, damage over time, crits, etc.). This is all very intuitive. But the gameplay itself is dull and repetitive.What makes Bastion work, though, is what's happening when you're not blasting, pounding, or burning alien critters. The just-in-time narration is excellent, and teeters between over-the-top seriousness and great dry humor. This narration that comes as you need it, mid-gameplay, works wonderfully and much better than cutscenes. There is a lesson here for other games.There is a compelling story here that takes effort and attention to comprehend. You have to continue past the main game into other modes to get the full story, or just look it up on Google when you're done. I frankly found the story to be a bit too abstruse to keep track of. I never developed too much interest in the characters who may not be what they say they are, or may be betraying you or not, or ... whatever. Blah blah blah. But the way the story is plugged directly into the gameplay via clever narration, gives you some very memorable experiences. No spoilers here, you'll have to trust me.I can't not mention the soundtrack. It's an excellent mash-up of old-West and Far-east, with electric drum beats and a stellar blues number thrown in for good measure. It reminds me of the old-West sci-fi soundtrack that accompanied the TV show ""Firefly"". There is no denying the spiritual influence. Listening to the song ""In case of Trouble"", I see scenes from Firefly in my head. This complete soundtrack stands alone wonderfully; my only wish would be for more vocal numbers, because ""Build That Wall"" is so moving when it's presented in the game.In summary, Bastion works because the whole is far greater and more memorable than its parts. Each element of this game augments the others - the average gameplay is elevated by the narration and the always-appropriate soundtrack, and the story that I struggled to care about still gave me chills and a jaw-dropping experience near the end, fueled by a sudden change in the gameplay and the always-appropriate soundtrack. Bastion is, most of all, a COMPLETE game experience, with a start, a middle, and an ending, where each element was clearly planned and thoughtfully executed, with polish and shine. Compare this to most games that simply end with a boss fight and a tacked on cut scene that explains what happened and teases a sequel, and you'll appreciate what a rare bird Bastion is in today's game market. Whether or not this particular title works for you, I hope you will agree with me that we need more games like Bastion. ",168,52,2,18,21,2,22

												So many great reviews that completely cover thgis one, so I'll just say a couple of things about this winning game.The narration is what makes this game for me. You get used to it quickly, and it's an excellent tool to move the story.And the story itself is outstanding ---- set up comes in the middle of events and go from there, filling in as needed.Gameplay is easy to understand for the casual player even though there are plenty of challenges and complex tasks to master.Artwork is gorgeous, music is great, and controls are easy.It's been around for a good while, and is on sale often ---- pick it up then, if you haven't already. Recommended for sure. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bastion is one of a kind and you owe it to yourself to play this game.A charming hack and slash/RPG, one of those games that you will never forget, for a particularly reason or not.Every character, every item, has a story and a function in the world. And they are all explained by the narrator, whose voice work is simply fantastic. A new way of narrative in games.What about the soundtrack? Remarkable piece of work.In the end this is all about the Kid's journey. How it will end up, it's up to you.			",248,52,8,9,6,2,29

												Honestly one of the best games I've ever played.The artwork is gorgeous, the soundtrack stunning (and one of my favourites of all time) and the storyline is, whilst not necessarily ground-breakingly original, re-inforced through characters who stray from the flat, one dimensional NPCs we're used to.Everything in this game is beautifully balanced: the Kid's silence is offset by the Narrator's frequent and colourful dialogue, the visuals do not detract from a core mechanic that works well and the characters themselves balance one another.One of the best features is that the game does offer a dynamic core mechanic: the difficulty can be stepped up through activating Idols, and the variety of weapons and skills allow for a challenging experience...should you desire it!Overall: a masterfully made game! And, lest we forget: Logan Cunningham...the gaming world's answer to Morgan Freeman!			",238,81,10,31,27,4,30

												Have you ever asked or been asked if video games are art? Look no further than this game to seek your answer. This game's beautiful art-style and stunningly moving (and reactive) narration is so powerful it will bring tears to your eyes, and is by far the best written game I have ever played (and I prefer games that focus on storytelling).Don't let the cute art-style or isometric perspective fool you - this is a tragedy set in a post-apocalyptic world (that's right, a post-apocalyptic world featuring every colour of the rainbow) that will have you battling both your conscience and fate through a linier narrative. The battle system may be simple, but there is enough variety of both melee and ranged weapons, stat-boosting tonics and difficulty-enhancing totems that you will find exactly the kind of game you are looking for, regardless of your tastes. Unusually for a linier story replayability abounds as this game features a 'New Game Plus' mode, 'Score Attack' mode, in-game challenges and multiple endings to the 9-hour story for you to sink your teeth into.If ever you have bought a game out of curiosty or on the word of another, let it be this one - you will not be disappointed.

												Crisp, detailed artwork. From the clouds rolling over the map, to the in-game items, everything is thoughtfully crafted and coherent. A single aesthetic for the entire game scales from little elements to full-fledged splash pages.The music does well to pair with the artwork. There's no let down. As much mood is created visually, there is equally fine musical pieces that create the sensations of adventure and tension in all the right places.  There's a major ""cool"" factor with the audio in general. The gruff but smoothly delivered voice-over fits the writing styles comfortable brevity. I never felt tired of sitting through narration. It was quick, to the point, but stylized to keep the entertainment flowing. The tunes mix atmosphere and raw, bluesy-western sounding guitar. Like our hero was born ""cool"" right out of the womb.  How easy it would've been to fudge these artistic choices and end up with something cheesy. Bastion is coherent on all fronts visual and auditory.  As for the mechanics and gameplay? I think they play second fiddle. Passable by all means - nothing seemed to be lacking, unresponsive, imbalanced, etc. But this game, in my opinion, is primarily a sight and sound to behold by the senses. Eat it up! ",45,5,0,6,7,0,2

												Bastion will forever live as one of the best games I have ever played. With a beautiful art and animation direction surrounded by a glorious and trully brilliant score, sound, and narration, Bastion grips the senses from the very moment you wake in a ruined floating city. As the entire experience is brought together with a powerful and driven story with unforgettable characters, it undoubtedly stands as a groundbreaking isometric role-playing game and an impressive debut game from Supergiant Games.	Not only does the main story impress, but every weapon training level provides an entirely different style of combat not only with the respective represented weapon but the very grounds upon where you must prove your tactical prowess is carefully crafted and detailed to offer an eye-catching and grip-tightening hold on the challenger. Similarly, the four trips to Who-Knows-Where pit you against wave after wave of enemies to test one beyond their normal gaming limits and bring one to a peak of their reaction-timing and accuracy mastery. Bastion includes 24 Steam Achievements that will each take the player to the edge of their gaming ability and focus. It will most certainly build a better gamer out of you. Bastion is absolute gaming perfection. 	With every brutally powerful enemy and cryptically beautiful scene, The Kid must traverse a broken sky for the materials needed to bring life back to his dying city of Caelondia and undo the damage wrought by The Calamity. As The Kid travels, he'll discover more than he bargained for surviving in vicious wildernesses, salvaged from fractured villages, and sacrificed to melted mountains. He'll face beasts of the wild, the warriors of The Ura, and even be tested by gods above to save the very fabric of reality, all the while unravelling the secrets of not only the city's fate, but his own past as well as his future.

Intro: Bastion might not be something to get a ton of hours out of or regularly play, but its one of the most original RPGs. The game's simple, but felt very unique and just a joy to play. Its also a nice change from having to put in 30+ hours for RPGs. While shorter games are often considered inferior, sometimes you want to play an RPG you can finish in reasonable time.Gameplay: The gameplay of Bastion is a top-down isometric Action RPG with linear level-based progression. It feels comfortable and familiar. There's a handful of weapons and skills to use and the levels are really enjoyable to play through. You can also shift the difficulty to make it much harder, but more rewarding. There might not be that much replayability, but there is a new game+ and score attack mode for anyone who loves the game enough to go for highscore runs or just play it again with their same gear.Story: Bastion's strongest point is the story. Jesus Christ, this game has a magnificent story. Its depressing, but beautiful. Its one of those games that really can leave an impact on you. Certainly a game I won't ever forget.Unfortunately, I don't want to say much more on it because I refuse to spoil it for anyone who hasn't played it. Just trust me on this :)Also, the story is narrated. It really sets the mood of the game. I couldn't imagine playing the game without the narration.Visuals: The artstyle is as good as they come. This is one of those games where you want to put posters of it up on your walls. Its quite colorful and looks hand-painted. Truly beautiful and unique.Music: The music is also excellent. Very interesting style. It blends a lot of different types of music together and creates this heavy electronica-inspired western style music. It might not sound good from my words, but it really is a wonderful a soundtrack. This is one of the few games that I download the OST to and listen to in my normal day.PC Version: There's a few different ways to play the game when it comes to controls. It all runs very well. No issues. There's not much to say here about it. Plays wonderfully on keyboard+mouse but just as well with a gamepad.Conclusion: Bastion is just a total masterpiece. If you haven't played it you need to. Its one of those must-play indie titles that people will still be talking about years from now. My review doesn't do it justice. Go play it now!

												I've heard so much about this game over the past four years. I was pretty skeptical of all the hype and glowing praise this game has received, but never one to judge unfairly, I picked this up on sale for about $5.Bastion is good. It is very good. I don't think it's the greatest indie game to have been made, but I can certainly see why people like it so much.At its heart, Bastion is an isometric hack'n'slash with small elements of dungeon grinding. You have a melee weapon, a ranged weapon, and a special attack. That's it. You can guard and evade roll, but you essentially only have three attacks the whole game. To make this simple formual work you are granted nearly ten different weapons to choose from, all upgradable, and all of which have their own unique special attacks. Further expanding on the simple gameplay is the ability to equip various drinks to give yourself buffs (i.e. extra damage, extra health, etc.)The game is balanced pretty well. I'm a vet myself, so I didn't have too much of an issue playing through this. There were a few hairy moments here and there, but ultimately Bastion isn't too hard. Unless you want it to be. In which case you can invoke the power of the gods, thus augmenting the enemy builds. While you can make them faster, more agressive, and sturdier, you also get an EXP and money boost for your trouble. Very well balanced.So the controls are tight, the gameplay is good, so how about the story? I won't give anything away, but it worked. Nothing too crazy, but it held my attention and inspired me to push on. The story itself might be simple, but the biggest draw of the game is the narrator. This was one of the biggest things I heard about this game: the narrator. All I'll say is: play it and find out on your own. It's pretty cool.While only clocking in at about 6 hours, Bastion manages to give an engrossing and surprisingly deep gameplay experience. Between listening to the narrator and watching the hand drawn world literally fall into place with your every step, Bastion manages to combine tight action gameplay with a unique art driven narrative. Go buy it.			",68,14,0,5,0,0,0

												An artsy action (I wouldn't call it an RPG, even ARPG) game set in a westernish/steampunkish fantasy world. The gameplay is unimpressive. Gets old pretty fast even with the new weapons and upgrades you are gradually given. I was also a bit annoyed by the crosshair cursor floating above the ground and messing up my aim.Where this game shines is the design. The world forming as you walk around is interesting. Nice art, good soundtrack and the narrator. Logan Cunningham narrating the story almost singlehandedly makes this game worth finishing.I'd say this game is worth getting, but don't pay too much for it. The replayability value ain't that good.			",244,62,1,46,36,5,47

												I've heard so much about this game over the past four years. I was pretty skeptical of all the hype and glowing praise this game has received, but never one to judge unfairly, I picked this up on sale for about $5.Bastion is good. It is very good. I don't think it's the greatest indie game to have been made, but I can certainly see why people like it so much.At its heart, Bastion is an isometric hack'n'slash with small elements of dungeon grinding. You have a melee weapon, a ranged weapon, and a special attack. That's it. You can guard and evade roll, but you essentially only have three attacks the whole game. To make this simple formual work you are granted nearly ten different weapons to choose from, all upgradable, and all of which have their own unique special attacks. Further expanding on the simple gameplay is the ability to equip various drinks to give yourself buffs (i.e. extra damage, extra health, etc.)The game is balanced pretty well. I'm a vet myself, so I didn't have too much of an issue playing through this. There were a few hairy moments here and there, but ultimately Bastion isn't too hard. Unless you want it to be. In which case you can invoke the power of the gods, thus augmenting the enemy builds. While you can make them faster, more agressive, and sturdier, you also get an EXP and money boost for your trouble. Very well balanced.So the controls are tight, the gameplay is good, so how about the story? I won't give anything away, but it worked. Nothing too crazy, but it held my attention and inspired me to push on. The story itself might be simple, but the biggest draw of the game is the narrator. This was one of the biggest things I heard about this game: the narrator. All I'll say is: play it and find out on your own. It's pretty cool.While only clocking in at about 6 hours, Bastion manages to give an engrossing and surprisingly deep gameplay experience. Between listening to the narrator and watching the hand drawn world literally fall into place with your every step, Bastion manages to combine tight action gameplay with a unique art driven narrative. Go buy it.			",68,14,0,5,0,0,0

												Finished this game from start to finish in about 4 and a half hours and I have to say, it is definately one of my favourite games! The narration alone makes the game somewhat fantastic, let alone the music of this game! THE MUSIC.... My god it's just incredible. The gameplay is very fun as well, but I do suggest that you play it with controller, cause I did play part of the game with keyboard, and switching to controller made it much more easier to handle. Would definately play this game again in my spare time if I wanted a little bit of fun, and to complete it 100% :) MUST BUY!			",606,178,8,74,59,2,52

												I like Bastion and I recommend it but it's probably not for everyone.The levels are generally well done but choosing the right weapons etc. is quite important which can lead to some frustrating trial-and-error (and a bit of grinding to level-up the weapons too perhaps)The narration and story are going to be loved by some and not others.  I started-off really enjoying it but it does get a bit wearing after a while - there's a change of tone from detatched observation to an almost ""I told you so - harder than you think""-ness about it and it REVELS in revealing that you're nowhere near the end when you think you might be;0It's mostly a charming and enjoyable action game tho and so I kinda point a thumb upwards here...

												An artsy action (I wouldn't call it an RPG, even ARPG) game set in a westernish/steampunkish fantasy world. The gameplay is unimpressive. Gets old pretty fast even with the new weapons and upgrades you are gradually given. I was also a bit annoyed by the crosshair cursor floating above the ground and messing up my aim.Where this game shines is the design. The world forming as you walk around is interesting. Nice art, good soundtrack and the narrator. Logan Cunningham narrating the story almost singlehandedly makes this game worth finishing.I'd say this game is worth getting, but don't pay too much for it. The replayability value ain't that good.			",244,62,1,46,36,5,47

												Somebody once told me this game is really awfulI ain't the sharpest player in the gameIt was looking kind of hard with it's enemies and bossesIn various aesthetically pleasing levelsWell the hours start going and they don't stop goingFed to the bosses and I hit the ground runningDidn't make sense not to use the Brushers PikeYour brain gets smart but your playstyle gets boringSo much to do, so much to killSo what's wrong with using the shrine?You'll never level up if you don't tryYou'll never get stronger if you get weakHey now, you're a brusher, get your pike on, go killHey now, you're an archer, get the bow, get levelsAnd all the other weapons are really badOnly that combinaton is truly worth itIt's a cool place and it doesn't make senseYou're interested now, wait till you get furtherBut the fanboys beg to differJudging by the number of positive reviewsThe path we walk is pretty thinAnd it's only getting smaller so you will fall offMy health's pretty low, how about yours?That's the way I hate it and I'll always get boredHey now, you're an okay game, get your sale on, go playHey now, you're a decent game, get the review on, get paidAll that's useful are two weaponsOnly brushers pike and bow are worth itSomebody once asked if I liked this game or not?I need to hear your opinion nowI said yep but it's not perfect It could use a little more polishAnd we could all use a bigger world spaceIt's an alright game for what it is, I guess.

												There are many games out there that can tell you a good story.  Some of them tell one so great you'll gush about it to anyone who'll listen.  Bastion does something a little different.  It's not the story itself, but the way it's told.  Lush environments assembling themselves under your feet at every step, robust landscapes waiting to be explored, and a gorgeous narrative alongside the natural squeak and strum of strings blend together to create a masterpiece.In short, Bastion will not disappoint.  You'll even want to spring for the soundtrack.  10/10.I expect 'Build That Wall' (Zia's Theme) will sit at the top of my favourite track list for a very long time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's wonderful that in the days of the AAA triumph and corporations tightening their grip around the gaming industry's neck we can still see examples of truly wonderful pieces of art, the memories of which linger long, long after the main storyline is finished and detailes became fuzzy. And Bastion is one of the better examples of games as art, where the story is conveyed in its own unique manner that couldnt've been done in the form of a book or a movie. The plot of the game is intelligent, serious, romantic, touching - it has it all for those of us striving for a bit of fairy-tale brilliance in our boring working lives. Mechanics blend into the mix perfectly, being simple enough not to get in the way of the story, and yet complex enough to give some room for imagination and all kinds of neat little tricks that hardcore gamers are prone to. And narrating... Do I even have to mention how good it is and how fresh the whole idea feels? Supergiant Games really made a huge leap forward with this one, a leap that teaches the lesson to all developers out there, trying to make their own perfect games.Maybe over the years people will forget Bastion and move on to newer titles... But I, for one, will return to this vivid and picturesque world from time to time. Because I lived a whole new life there - short, but nonetheless beatiful.			",207,92,2,49,17,1,27

												A worthwhile adventure. The rundown...The beautiful hand-drawn animations, fun combat, cool story presentation, and great music all come together to make this a great game. Gameplay: Mostly centres around combat, which is very well done, and fun for the duration of the game. As you progress you unlock cool weapons that make a lot out of simple controls. Story: Not particularly amazing BUT the narrator who guides you through the game is so cool. Really incredible presentation, with lots of style - think Firefly (the TV series) mixed into a fantasy world.To consider...- It's got a New Game+ feature so that you can hunt achievements based on modifiers you find. This is good, because the campaign is only about ~5 hours.- Really meant for a mouse and keyboard! The aiming is a little wonky with controllers.			",120,45,6,19,22,3,35

												Where do I start, this game drew me because of its beautiful art work and when I saw the trailer, it had a very unique gameplay experience which was delivered at the time, you would hear live narration which are a result of your actions in the game.Bastion has a nice fresh indie touch to it, the third person view from the top also gives you a nice immersive feel, which you don't get to see in a lot of games these days.It has a very beautiful sound track which keeps you hooked onto the game for long.Warning, this game can get very addictive, letting go of the controller seems impossible.For everyone who're looking out to buy the game, please do, you'll get your money's worth from it!

												Once again, close friends and strangers of the internet, I'm back to review a game. I rarely feel the need to instantly write a review for a game; I generally like to replay the game so that I can see it from multiple angles (with the exception of FarCry 3-Blood Dragon. I've suffered enough. However, this game is still making my hands tremble from excitement some 12 seconds after I finished it. Without any further build-up, I give you... The Review Developed by Supergiant Games, Bastion sets place is a post apocalyptic world (Man, this steam sale I really went all out in Post-apocalyptic games) I don't really want to give too much away about the story (That's a lie, I really do want to, but for you, loyal or disloyal reader, I won't), the whole experience really is a journey more that a game. The excellent storytelling by voice actor Logan Cunningham was exceptional. This guy has the sexiest voice since Morgan Freeman. Seriously, his voice is like velvet. I loved the story all the way through. I did feel like it was balancing on the edge of getting repetitive like some kind of tight rope walker of dullness, but it never crossed that line, creating a rich game with plenty of replay value (Blood Dragon, Take note)Okay, now to something I can never seem to appreciate outside of the video gaming world.  ART!!!  This game was beautiful. It removed all need for me to go outside or even leave my chair. The way the world generated itself around you did a great many things including1. Add to the uniqueness of the game2. Create a need for completionist to search every single edge with the hope it might create a secondary pathand, subsequently3. Make REPLAY VALUE (*Cough Cough Blood Dragon)The art design of the characters, enemies, scenery and weapons was truly something to be admired. Hats off to Jen Zee, the god in human form who made this exist.The music of this game was a delicacy. I know I say this a lot with my reviews but I'm seriously considering putting the soundtrack on my phone. It always perfectly supported the art style, the story at that point and Logan Cunningham's sexy voice (Call me!)The combat was smooth and also commendable. Players had the choice of 13 different weapons (Excluding the battering ram) and were required to choose a melee and a range as well as a special move. The special moves were never over powered but they certainly did aid combat and contrasted against what was never dull combat. The combat in itself was great. There was a countering system which, though difficult to perform, were occasionally the only way to do serious damage to an enemy (This often depended on the weapons you chose.) The weapons you chose definitely affected the game. Weapons varied in range, speed and some required reloading and cooldowns. I choose to use the hammer and the duel pistols, however I'm sure everyone who's played this game will have less then positive opinions on my loadout. It really does depend on the individual play styles. The weapons could be upgraded, which was both significant and necessary to the game.Along with the main story line, there were also trials that you could do on the side for each specific weapon. Receiving a high score would earn you either third, second, or first prize depending on how quickly you completed the trial, how well you completed the trial or how many shots it took you to complete the trial. The rewards ranged from an upgrade for a specific weapon, the games currency or even a special move if you took first place. I was discouraged to say the least when I couldn't unlock the special move for my duel pistols and could have easily spent another half an hour if my fingers weren't about to start bleeding. This was a great way to add extra content and add to the depth of the game (This is the last reference I'm making to Blood Dragon)One great addition to the game was basically a wave based combat system in which you fought off waves of enemies whilst receiving back-story for one specific character. This was a great way to add depth and extra content to your game. I hope whoever came up with this idea was given a raise. (The back-story for the characters was well written and well voiced by the very sexily voiced Logan Cunningham.Finally, Something I never really explored in the game was the ability to use the shrine. This basically granted bonus XP or currency, but made huge effects onto the game (enemies respawing after you killed them, more enemies, more health and powerful enemies ect. Some shrines even did the reverse, making the game easier.Alright, if I haven't convinced you yet, go visit a doctor. This game deserves your money. Go get it now.Seriously, I'll wait.What are you waiting for?If you haven't got it yet, I'm very disappointed in you. Let's recap.Everything about this game is perfect, except that I'm not playing it right now.Anyway, needless to say, this game receives a 10/10Thanks for reading, see you next time.

												Bastion is, and will, probably always be one of my favorite games if not THE favorite game.Bastion at its core is not a really unique game, with simple but fast and fun gameplay.But Bastion relys on something else entirely,the atmosphere.The Graphics, the music, the narrator, everything fits together so perfectly.I listen to the music on my way to school pretty much evey single day. The Graphics  matches perfectly my interests - Blooming, colorfull fantasy and a somewhat Steampunky Atmosphere. Everything is wonderfully designed, every level has a unique feeling to it and nothing seems to be repetetive.And then there is the narratorBastion would probably lack something if the narrator wouldn't be there. Everytime i hear this old fella i feel like coming home, with such a wonderfull gravely and 'Old man from the west' Voice that you will easily get into the game in no time.Here is a real advice though:Go into the game with no real expectations, take your time, play it at a time where you don't have to worry about things, get yourself your favorite Drink and enjoy this wonderfull piece of an Adventure.I highly reccommend you to buy this game, especially when its on Sale.

This game deserved an overwhelmingly positive reviewEven if Bastion is short (just a few hours <11hrs' mine>, depending on how many challenges you're keen on passing with a gold medal rating) it's one of the few games in which the New Game+ (rewinding the whole adventure but keeping the endgame resources) was just as much fun as the first playthrough. The content might be identical, but you've probably missed out on a few platforms the first time around, so you'll have the opportunity of discovering them and testing out your untapped weapons as well.The storytelling is unique and relaxing. While you do work fighting off enemies, the narrator gives you the lowdown. The world you explore is fragmented and broken, but the visual element of the game is gorgeous. Most importantly, Bastion's music ties everything together. I can still hear the bluesy guitar line and the hurt voice of a character you meet early in the game.A game you should buy 10/10 !

This basically granted bonus XP or currency, but made huge effects onto the game (enemies respawing after you killed them, more enemies, more health and powerful enemies ect. Some shrines even did the reverse, making the game easier.Alright, if I haven't convinced you yet, go visit a doctor. This game deserves your money. Go get it now.Seriously, I'll wait.What are you waiting for?If you haven't got it yet, I'm very disappointed in you. Let's recap.Everything about this game is perfect, except that I'm not playing it right now.Anyway, needless to say, this game receives a 10/10Thanks for reading, see you next time.

												Typically when a game's length comes into question, it's because of triple-digit hours on one save file. However, Bastion is one of those rare flames that petered out too quickly. Whether this complements the strong gameplay and story or serves as a complaint of an unfinished product is up to the reader. I am certain of this, though: some developer somewhere is scribbling down ways to turn Bastion's novel approach to RPGs into a multi-million dollar project. Few games can claim that they revolutionized the industry, and when they do, it's the one simple, novel idea that makes the mark. For Bastion, that's the velvety narrator who comments on nearly every aspect of gameplay. Fall off the landscape? He's got something to say about it. Thwart a boss without getting nicked? Expect a new piece of dialogue. Choose any two weapons? Prepare to methodically run through every combination of equipment. But he does more than simply comment. The narrator tells the story from the perspective of a weathered, rustic old man who's made mistakes and bears the burden of regret. At the same time, he speaks of The Kid as a champion–someone who can make things right. And that's where you come in: as The Kid, you have the opportunity to fix a sort of man-made apocalypse called the Calamity. Finding survivors along the way, The Kid has to restore power back to Bastion, the protagonists' headquarters. By finding crystals through linearly explored areas, The Kid grants Bastion energy, and buildings for some reason. Players have the illusion of choice when deciding which structure to erect, each of which grants some sort of ability or perk. The Arsenal, for example, allows the player to choose which weapons he'd like to equip, as well as a super power. Alternatively, the Shrine invokes the gods, which can make the game more difficult with a slight boost to experience and money; it's worth mentioning that the ways in which a player may increase difficulty are creative and keep the game new. However, all aspects of the game maintain a pine-fresh scent. Initially, Bastion's quick-paced, action-based gameplay is good, simple fun. Truly, without activating an idol or two, the game is a bit on the easy side. Though, should you falter, you're granted one reprieve. An additional pratfall results in running the entire level over again. Normally, a lack of checkpoints in extensive stages is a critical game design flaw, but with adjustable difficulty, this is more than fair. For those looking for a challenge and adrenaline rush, the penalty of running some of the longer levels over again can be enticing; however, those who enjoy whimsical hack-n-slashery need just avoid the idols. Although the game gets harder over time even in its vanilla state, leveling up and weapon upgrades maintain one's interest. When leveling up and choosing a potion to make The Kid stronger, players have several choices to make. Do I want more mobility when holding up my shield, or do I want to have a slight increase to critical chance? Another shop allows players to purchase gods for the Shrine, potions for leveling up perks, and even special powers for the Arsenal. Other buildings include achievements and weapon upgrading with customization. Although Bastion egregiously offers pseudo-choices the way so many other games of its ilk do, the customization, challenges, and achievements are well thought out. Valve and Kongregate will tell you with firsthand experience that easy, medium, and hard difficulty achievements are necessary if goal-setting is going to motivate players even a bit; Bastion has this covered. I completed certain auxiliary objectives without even knowing about them, while others took conscious effort and practice. Thankfully, customization makes challenges easier. In this way, some of the side missions can be thought of more as puzzles with an element of skill, but others will require finesse, alacrity, and accuracy to conquer. However, I didn't find any Excalibur equivalents, and even if I thought I did, my brother glanced over at my screen and asked me how the heck I was using that weapon combination and special power; the sentiments were reciprocated. And isn't this the goal of any designer who includes gameplay options? As alluded to in the beginning of the review, Bastion is more than just gameplay and a novel plot: it's an experience. For those who've read my King's Bounty reviews, you're probably well-aware of my love of color. Modern gaming can be so monochrome and drab that when a game as vibrant as Bastion comes along, the appeal is two-fold; not only is color in itself enticing, but we're so starved for it that our love for it is accentuated. Additionally, not only has Bastion been graced by daubs of the palette, it's extremely busy. While clutter can certainly reach a threshold, Bastion never oversteps its bounds. The developers made sure to keep the minds and eyes of its consumers occupied while not getting in their way. Another marvel of the layout is just how intuitive foreground breakables are. Many other games leave questions as to what can be examined and destroyed, and what is meant to be left alone in the background. Some may complain that foreground pillars and structures can get in the way, but this reviewer perceives that as a necessary evil given how beautiful the game is. But what would a game be without music to match the visuals? Although most of the music is forgettable, some of the tunes have lasting power. Keeping with the atmosphere of a western, the occasional acoustic guitar and harmonica make for some innovative RPG music. However, the aural highlights of Bastion lie in its vocal numbers. Simple instrumentation matched with truly melodious voices grants us serene, wistful songs. Couple this with intelligent lyrics, and Bastion leaves an imprint on anyone with a love of music or beating heart. Typically, voice acting hurts or helps in a humble way. To my knowledge, never has a game been recommended purely because of the voice acting, but Bastion might be the first. Sure, we play games to enjoy deep, fun gameplay and funny or immersive storytelling. However, what if the defining feature was its narrator, and how that story was told? Take away Bastion's voice, and that leaves a pretty good game with fun combat in a slightly unique take on a post-apocalyptic world. With the voice, Bastion isn't just a great game, it's a work of art. Never before had I anticipated a person's name in the credits of a game, just so I could seek them out online and see what they've done and what they will do. I would be absolutely astonished and floored if this is the last we hear of Logan Cunningham. Finally, the controls are what you would expect of a game of this caliber. Nigh-perfect in its intuitive rolling and hit detection, the only complaints I can make are in its auto-targeting mechanism. Due to Bastion's archaic take on defending, players may steer clear of the shield due to its unreliability. When defending, The Kid automatically faces the nearest target, which makes sense. When I close a good, long book, I always feel a little sad, as if I had just said good bye to an old friend. I want to know what happens to the characters that I grew to love, but I have to accept the end and move on. Bastion is a short game, which will run most people around five or six hours. Nevertheless, I feel that same kind of loss. Although I truly believe that Bastion could have doubled its length in terms of gameplay, I'm glad that the story didn't risk imploding on itself. Don't let anyone tell you this is a Diablo clone–that would cheapen Bastion; it needs to be heard to be believed.			",2267,868,87,236,310,22,349

												This is quite possibly one of the best games I have ever played. It's beautiful, attmospheric, and the controls don't make me want to throw my laptop out of a window. The music is very calming, and the narrator's voice, although unexpected at first, becomes very soothing once you get familiar with it. The characters are very well done, and the art in the game is absolutely astounding. It looks as if it were hand painted. I would absolutely recommend this game for anyone that enjoys action RPG's.

It's art, narration and music combined creates an unforgettable experience for the player.The game has a nice story, somewhat predictable, but it still manages to touch the mind to a certain degree.The learning curve is smooth, adding features as you progress, with little ramification.The action can be really fast paced and require skill for those who want the chanllenge, but there's also a mode for those who want to see the story and ""skip"" combatA game that deserves to be in the library of every true gamer out there.

												Bastion is by far one of the greatest games that I've played. Although the game is linear, it's easy to forget that as you slowly uncover the details of what caused the Calamity. In addition, there is a large amount of customizability with what weapons you use, and they allow for many different playstyles. In addition, instead of picking an arbitrary difficulty at the beginning (For example, if you pick between easy and hard, what makes hard more difficult than easy?), the game allows you to create your own challenge - while also rewarding you with more EXP if you choose to do so. The storytelling in the game is also phenomenal, and makes replaying the game so much more fun - because you can't catch every detail in your first play through. I've beaten the game many times and still notice something new each time. Overall, this is a great game and shows that Supergiant Games will definitely continue to be a great video game company.

												Bastion is beautiful in every way.  It feels more like a work of art then anything else Iv'e played before.  The gameplay is pretty simple and straight forward, venture into different areas to find shards that will help repair ""The Bastion.""  While doing this you destroy varying types of enemies with weapons you find along the way, wether it be a giant hammer, a katana, a rifle, or the many other weapons that you find.  Every shard that you find allows you to upgrade the bastion in some way that unlocks other aspects of the game. Sounds pretty straightforward but what makes Bastion great is it's approach to this style of gameplay.  The beautiful hand painted environments spring up around you as you venture through the lands, while a narrator reacts to your every move.  Supplement this with a wonderful bluesy-folk soundtrack, and you have a game that is really appealing to your emotions.  I would recommend that anyone pick this game up given the chance.

												I missed it back in the days. I thought it's a some diablo clone.My God, how I was wrong. Bastion is the first game in 10 years I think which I started second time. And it was right after my first playthrough.It's just brilliant in every detail and in the same time pretty simple. Brawler with fantastic design of Jen Zee (check her on deviantart) and beautiful story told by strong but gentle voice of the narrator would capture your heart. This part of the game is so good that Bastion don't need any mind-blowing gameplay. But it does. It's simple but solid, skillful and highly addictive. Oh I forgot to mention the music, one word... amazing. Buy it with OST.Do you need any numbers? 89/100			",695,247,14,63,59,10,79

Posted: May 1, 2014
												 It's an isometric action indie game (although I don't know how being published by Warner Bros is indie but nevermind that.) This is probably the first indie non-sandbox game I’ve played. It follows through the adventures of a boy the „Kid” who’s entire race was wiped off of the face of the earth „Bastion” by a strange event called the „Calamity”. The „Kid” is trying to salvage through the remains of his civilization exploring the world trying to find clues, and certain items to restore „Bastion” to its former glory.I’ll follow the usual format of game reviews just to make it easier to read.-	Story/QuestsThe story itself is quite mediocre I’d say, there are no mind-blowing twists or hilarious moments in it. The quest mechanic are basically the same „go and fetch this and that” repeating around 16 times which can be tedious after a while. However an unique feature of the game is that EVERYTHING is narrated, no not by Morgan Freeman but by a more „macho” sounding gentleman Logan Cunningham who is also great in what he does. The narration gives an interesting vibe to the game, you feel like you’re part of the story and it feels like „living in the book”, making the fights/progression and story more immersive. The narrator also has some quirky comments when you change your loadout or accidentally fall off of a floating island which made me smile quite a few times. -	Graphics/LooksThe art of the game is beautiful. Every level has a different story, feel to it which makes you forgive the (otherwise tedious) quests. Everything is colorful, rich and vibrant. Thankfully the game doesn’t have any serious system requirements it runs easily on a laptop so you can enjoy it in its full glory. There’s not much more to say, go watch some trailers or gameplay videos :)-	Combat/GameplayThe game is very combat-centric, you don’t have much time to immerse yourself into the game or admire the scenery without getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by the various enemies. It’s like Bioshock Infinite, beautiful and interesting but you must keep on grinding through hordes of various enemies. The enemy variety is alright when you start to get bored there’s always a new type of enemy appearing. The combat itself is surprisingly fun with a great variety in weapons and combat styles. There is no quick-save or even checkpoints, a game is only saved after you successfully finish a level.You have one primary and a secondary weapon slot and a variety of weapons (ranging from katanas to muskets) which you can upgrade. You also have a special ability slot which you can use to throw grenades or place a decoy of yourself to confuse enemies. There’s supposed to be an alchemy system and stealth in the game but I didn’t really want to get into it, I stick to my guns thanks. The combat is incredibly fast-paced and hectic with tons of enemies coming at you, sometimes you even feel like you’re playing an isometric „Shoot ’em Up” dodging projectiles all the time. The game is HARD, the enemies hit hard even on easy difficulty you find yourself grasping for breath, looking for health potions and trying to survive. You have three chances to „respawn” after dying if you exceed it then you must start the level all over again. There are the usual boss batles and you should apply a different strategy for different foes.Conclusion:Bastion is a fun little game, but it has its flaws. I love reading classic literature in my free time so my expectations of a „story” are quite high when I play video games. The game is beautiful, the combat is fun but challenging, and the narration brings a refreshing change to the storytelling. I recommend it to people who like games with an unique world, and lore but who also like getting their hands dirty in frequent fights. I don’t recommend it to people who don’t like hard fast paced, crazy combat and to people who don’t like to start a level all over again. The game takes around 6-8 hours to beat, but I heard that there are two different endings so it gives some replay value (I didn't really care about the story so one playthrough was enough for me :) )Story 6/10Graphics 9/10Combat 8/10Overall 8/10Oh I forgot to mention:THE SOUNDTRACK IS F*****ING AMAZING!!!!I mean really, I was even thinking of putting it on my phone just to listen to it its so great.

												The reason why I bought Bastion was because of the immense praise and positive reviews it recieved on release. That might have been a mistake on my part, since I expected it to be a lot more than what it turned out to be. I didn't get the indie gem I thought I was getting, but instead a mediocre hack n slash with some underwhelming RPG elements slapped on top. It does have one thing going for it admittedly, and that's the presentation. The isometric graphics are beautiful, they were clearly shown a lot of love, and the narration is enjoyable, even though it gets kind of irritating after a while.The gameplay on the other hand is dreadful. It may be responsive and functional, but it is incredibly dull and repetitive and offers little challenge or variation. The levels are essentially all the same, there are no puzzles or interesting gameplay elements to differentiate them, only a slight difference in color hue and tileset. There isn't much enemy variation and it just feels like you're powering through mob after mob to get a little bit of story to keep you going(and the story is only decent at best).My advice is to try the demo and see how you like it, since it will give a pretty good idea what you will do for the rest of the game. Don't believe the hype.			",31,14,0,11,12,0,3

												A unique action packed indie game that is voiced by an epic narrator. The story line and gameplay are absolutely amazing, which is all voiced of course. You have a variety of weapons that all help in various sticky situations from the precise and deadly bow to the devastating hand cannon. Music and controls are excellent. Definitely a must-have indie game. What are you waiting for? Get this game now and see for yourself :D.			",87,10,0,7,4,1,3

												From the second you drop into the game ~ quite literally ~ you're greeted by a deep, rich voice who decides to narrate your every move from that point on. You travel through numerous regions filled with gorgeous handpainted artwork, finding an arsenal of unique, diverse weapons and learn to master them all through various trials of skill. Finally, as you come closer and closer to the end of the line, you slowly uncover the pieces of a heartbreaking tale between two peoples that leads to the calamity.4 years later, this game still has high replay value and I constantly listen to the soundtrack outside of the game.Awesome story. Awesome narration. Awesome music. Awesome gameplay. Awesome game. One of the best games I've ever played.			",330,82,17,51,38,3,79

												Play this Game.I bought Bastion back when it first showed up on Steam and I played a while but I never got the chance to finish. Recently I was looking for something different to play so I thought I'd fire Bastion up again and give it a play through. I love this game.Bastion is about a boy who ""wakes up"" in the middle of what the game calls the Calamity. Your story is narrated as you (this boy) progress through levels that build themselves around you. This should not be confused with procedurally generated levels, rather there's a hint of where a path should be and as you move, tiles form up around you. This is a pretty cool effect even if it's totally linnear. As you progress the story deepens, you find new weapons, upgrades, secrets etc. to battle your way through the game's enemies with a goal of restoring the Bastion, the game's home point. I never found the combat to be particularly challenging, with enemies brodacatsting attacks well before they happen and picking up fairly predictable patterns to counter. Your weapons and skills are more than strong enough to handle everything the game throws at you. You will have the opportunity to make things harder on yourself as you complete more peices of the Bastion if you wish. Weapons can be upgraded at the Bastion's forge, adding extra damage, or critical chance etc. You'll also be able to switch out skills and buy power up type items to help you along. And at the end you'll get to unlock a new game plus mode which adds a little replayability.Level design is pretty cool, as I mentioned above the world forms around you as you move along. Sometimes leading to dead ends, sometimes leading to secret areas containing upgrade materials, or new story items, even companion type characters. It's worth exploring every corner you can in these well built, beautifully rendered, but often very small areas. The story itself is at first just a narration of what you do as the game's hero character, but soon enough you'll start to feel it coalescing into something bigger. As you play, the game's narrator continues to tell the stories of the boy and various survivors of the calamity. This takes place in the game itself along with aquiring items to learn about and that help tell the history of the Bastion and it's home world and the people who inhabit it. Once things begin to move the story progresses quickly and in my opinion is told pretty masterfully. Now, Ive heard of people complaining about the narration of the game. Saying that he's too involved, or too in your face. That he never shuts up and they just want to play the game. I'm sorry to say that you can't shut the narrator off for those of you who may find him annoying. But on the other hand, he's the one telling the story, and Bastion is a story driven game so you need the narrator. I personally loved listening to him, the voice is pleasant, smooth and to me at least was nothing close to invasive. The narrator is integral to the game's story being told so you'll just have to deal with it and even if you don't like listeing to him I'm sure as things go on you'll at least be interested in what he has to say. The story itself is emotial, fairly deep and told really really well.As is usual these days the game is short, around 6 hours I think total with potential of a couple more if you complete the optional mini games. But the fact is the story is fully told in this time, so you get a feeling of completion even though you it's a short play through, and with new game plus you can double the play value and still have fun.Bastion, also has an epic sound track. ""Zia's song"", and the end theme ""Coming Home"" are two that stick out in my head. I believe the game even comes with a copy of the sound track if I remember corrctly. In conclusion, Bastion, is a beautiful, short, story driven game with an excellent story and great original music. It's inexpensive and worth a play through. Give it shot I'm sure you'll dig it.

												I cannot sing the praises of this game enough. I went into this knowing next to nothing, not even knowing how well praised it is. This has become my favorite game. The story is interesting and quite grim. There are no cutscenes or excessive text. It doesn't try to be a movie, it's a very subtle and gameplay driven story. The Narrator's voice gives Morgan Freeman a run for his money. The gameplay is fun and stays fresh for the most part. Interesting enemies and lore. The art style is beautiful, I adore how the land forms at your feet.And the soundtrack? Don't even get me started on the soundtrack. It is PHENOMENAL. I could listen to it nonstop. There is not a single song that is any less than the others. There are a few songs that have singers, which is usually a no-no in video games, but it suits the situation perfectly.The one thing that really bothers me only applies to you if you want to complete every little thing in the game like I do. It's no problem if you're a ""finish the story then I'm out"" kind of person. But the grinding. To buy every upgrade for every weapon, you have to beat Who Knows Where many times, or replay New Game+ multiple times. It gets stale, but I need to beat the Calamity Cannon training grounds, dammit!Bottom line, buy it. I'd wait for a Steam Sale (then again, I do for everything), but it's worth every cent. Supergiant Games deserves it so they can hopefully make more awesomeness. I can't wait to try Transistor.			",193,32,2,17,8,2,19

Finally got a chance to get it and play it, love it ever since!!!The game itself is amazing and well done, from the amazing narrative voice actor basically saying your every action, to the visuals and gameplay (skills, weapons and the Bastion itself). Its defiantly worth getting this game there is defiantly nothing else like it (nothing i know anyway) it’s very unique and extremely enjoyable. It’s a story, action, rpg, 2.5D bundle of awesome. Very enjoyable and rather difficult in some places.Well deserved 9/10!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do you want a new and exciting game? Look no further. There is no imitation, Bastion is unique in many ways and for it, it is a breath of fresh air. I cannot say how grateful I am for the release of this game. It helped me enjoy gaming again in a sea of sameness and overdone sequels.The mechanics are simple enough to learn, but complex enough to enjoy. The mix of upgrading weapons, using different potion upgrades and adding different gods in the shrine make for unique challenges throughout.The story is bizarre in a way, but everything is explained with enough context through out so that you keep pushing to learn more and more, eventually feeling sad for what they had brought upon themselves.

												Bastion and Limbo are the most artistic games I played, and also really satisfying experiences. These two made me really interested in Indie games.Bastion feels like anything but a soulless game when I play it. It's really a captivating experience. The music is truly awesome, that narrator is an impressive feature, the story is flawless and the mood it creates is irresistible. Bastion is simply amazing.Of all games I played, it has the best soundtrack by far. Check this for an example:

												Bastion combines a wonderful mix of story, art, music, and gameplay all in a way that feels unique to itself.  The game starts you off with little direction but the narrator's voice as you get used to the controls, combat system, level flow, and most importantly the signature level design.  Every environment is Bastion ""builds"" itself from the ground up around you creating a very unique take on the ""fog of war"" style exploration you commonly see in strategy games.  Story-wise all of this is the result of some far-flung calamity that literally destroyed a good chunk of the world.  This puts the story's focus half on keeping up the progress of the Bastion's buildings and exploration of what's left around you.The graphics are wonderfully rendered and everything looks like a mix of semi-realistic 3D and hand-drawn sprites similar to a sort of top-down version of Braid.  Despite the bleak undertones, the colors are vibrant even in the darker levels and every place feels both desolate yet full of life as you see what's become of the world around you.  All of these are explored via your home base- the titular Bastion which acts both as a hub for missions, power ups, weapons, and side-quests, but also serves to both tell and fill in the holes of the story you missed through the narration that goes on throughout the levels.There are only four named characters in the game counting the protagonist, but all of them are surprisingly well-developed for how little any of them actually speak.  All of them have special reactions to pretty much everything you bring back with you on each trip and each has a backstory to explore through special bonus levels.  While interaction with them is minimalistic at best, you really grow to know who they are and care about their well being just as much as in games where you spend most of the story talking to them, which is quite the accomplishment on part of the frankly stellar narration.For how much of the game you're going to spend in combat, it sometimes feels like it takes a back seat to everything going on around you.  However, you'll never get distracted from it and each of the game's unique weapons has its own bonuses and downsides making no combination (you can take two with you, plus one special move of your choice) a bad call.  It really calls to create your own fighting style and do what suits you best.  Due to how you can upgrade any weapons in a variety of ways, there's really no wrong way to go into battle and it's always fun.  What makes things more interesting is that depending on what weapons you pick, how you choose to go about a level, and even how well you're doing or whether you decide to simply derp about, the narrator has a response to pretty much EVERYTHING you do, which adds a bit of flavor and life to the game that feels a lot more like you're actually being watched and having your story told.The soundtrack of the game is just as varied as everything else in it and always manages to hit the perfect mood, particularly with the wonderfully done vocal songs.  Many levels or situations have their own music and no two songs really feel the same or reused whenever they appear.Overall Bastion is a wonderful experience that takes roughly seven to ten hours to complete in one playthrough.  It's not a long game, but at the same time it's not any longer or shorter than it needs to be.  But you'll be thankful for that because it means you can easily play it again.  If you ever see it appear in sales or the Humble Bundle as it's often wont to, I highly suggest picking it up if it even sounds remotely interesting to you.			",148,32,1,25,15,3,23

												This game's hand-drawn art combines beautifully with it's famous narrative style of storytelling as you play through the floating world of Caelondia. It's gameplay is very enjoyable, with a variety of weapons for you to find and carry on your adventures, from muskets to machetes. The featured town/shop system  is very straighforward and easy to get used to. The only thing I can even say I didn't like about this game was the in-game player model. He seemed out-of-place with the rest of the world, as his animation was different. Aside from that, would definitely recommend for you to buy it. 8.5/10			",79,9,0,10,3,0,3

If you take away the narrator you realise all you're doing is killing everything while moving from one place to another and the story isn't actually as brilliant (but still damn good) as everyone says. But that in no way stops this game from being worth my money, try the demo first.			",164,26,0,32,14,0,13

												Bastion is a wonderful game. Everywhere you go is bright and colorful but you're in such a dark world. The enemies are creative and the mechanics of taking out certain ones make the game challenging and fun. Medium 100% all easy achievements except one, however slightly time consuming.9/10 Squirts			",587,270,20,56,67,4,65

												I became interested in 'Bastion' when I first saw its beautiful illustrations. The artwork was so stunning that I intended to play the game purely for its art direction. However, within moments of beginning the game, I found myself captivated by the narrator (who tells the story in a 'Shawshank Redemption'-like style) and immersed in the game mechanics. The story of Bastion unfolded steadily and controls were explained so clearly that it was difficult to put this game down. Easily one of my favourites, I strongly recommend Bastion and prefer it over 'Transistor'.			",29,5,0,1,2,0,1

												5 out of 5. Simply put an amazing game that has everything you want in a video game and does so at bargain basement prices. Artstyle is literally like the pictures shown above. Gorgeous colors that cover the entire palette with detailed maps and smooth animations. Maps are varied and ""grow"" as the player progresses. Really helps set the feel of exploring a ruins floating in the sky.Sound FX are generally good, but the soundtrack is amazing. I remember stopping play and just zoning out the first time I realized the utterly beautiful sounds I was hearing was an in game character singing the refrain of the soundtrack song of that level. Be warned...you may want to buy the soundtrack seperately after playing this game.Gameplay is a multi-button hack-n-slash at its heart but seamlessly intertwines advanced combat mechanics if the players desires to use them. This is good because the difficulty can be set to a very fine degree through player controlled options...pray to a god and he (she/it) will give you more XP/whatever, but at a price (higher monster HP, damage, etc)...pray to numerous gods and you get an exponentially harder game should you so desire. There's a ""Game+"" mode for multiple replay and at 5-10 hours of single playthrough you'll actually want to do so to get those higher level skills (but won't feel bogged down / bored by doing so) .Finally, the story is a fairly simple affair, but small affects given to it make it very impactful. The narrator is an integral part of your playthrough (and a character in the game) detailing your every move through the world as you explore it. The other chacters backstories are slowly developed, but rapidly you're put into a storyline decision where you honestly don't know which way you should go. In the end, the story was perfect for what this game is trying to do.Can't recommend this enough...buy x2 if its on sale!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a very good game overall.The gameplay is fun, though it might become a bit repetitive, but the developers try to avoid this by giving you new weapons throughout the whole game. The weapons are easy to use and quite fun aswell.The storytelling is definitely the most solid part of this game. The narrator uses his GOD DAMM FANTASTIC voice to voice over everything you do. I.E: when you defeat an enemy with no problems he will comment on that, or if you keep falling off the map, he will tell you that you are stupid. The narrator tells also the story, which is quite good and very engaging.The art style is gorgeus. You can spend minutes just looking at some of the sceneries that you are shown. Just beautiful.As I said, it´s a very enjoyable game and you should totally purchase it.			",64,12,4,3,10,0,4

Must Play not only for Indie FansBastion is a top-down action adventure and the first title by Supergiant Games. It takes place in a dystopian, destroyed fantasy world that is nevertheless colorfully painted. You play as The Kid, a mysterious young man with white hair, and are aided by an omnipresent narrator that dynamically narrates your actions and is also used to deliver the game's lore to you in a very natural way.The gameplay focuses on a combat system based on dodging and rolling. It features an arsenal of melee- and long range weapons that all work and control differently, including a warhammer, dual pistols, a flamethrower and a machete that can also shoot blades. You can customize your experience using a variety of light RPG elements like weapon upgrades, an active ability(like a spin for the hammer or an AoE attack for the flamethrower)and passive boni that you receive by drinking different kinds of liquor you can unlock with experience. There is also an option to make your game harder and receiving more XP in return and a New Game+ Mode.Bastion is an interactive piece of art. The handdrawn art is gorgeous, the soundtrack is among the best ever heard in videogames, and the gameplay synchronises really well with it.			",123,26,0,9,2,0,10

												Bastion is pretty much just great all around. The story is powerful and makes unique use of a narrator in a way I've never seen any other game do, especially at the last level. At the end, I wasn't totally sure I'd made the right decision, but like...in a good way, I think? The soundtrack is fantastic; finding Zia for the first time is a magical experience. There's a ton of different weapons with different upgrades and stuff. The art is fairly detailed despite the simplified style and works really well with the design and the weird ""level assembles itself under your feet"" dynamic. It's super great and you should play it.			",29,21,1,14,5,0,5

												Let's begin with a disclaimer: Bastion if really freaking hard to describe.At its core, it's a top down action game with RPG elements, and at that, it does its job. The game plays like a charm, and most of the weapons are fun to use (even if I found myself liking the ranged options more). The whole game feels extremely tight and polished.Where Bastion really shines, however, is its story AND the way it is presented. Every action you take, even some really meaningless ones (being hit by an enemy in the first level, breaking crates) are commented by the ever present Narrator - if you ever played Portal and liked how GladOs reacted to your actions, you'll like this, too. The story is very good, too, and among a plethora of brown and bleak post-apocalyptic scenarios, I feel the colorful fragmented world of post-calamity Bastion is a refreshing spin on an over-abused genre.With how little it costs, seriously, you just owe this game to yourself. And your friends, possibly.			",248,49,3,28,5,2,14

												It is a good game. I'd give it 8 / 10Bastion is an isometric action beatem up game which has unique visual art and story narration.What you will like:+ Very attractive visuals.+ Solid gameplay mechanics+ Story narration is unique (at least used to be in 2011)+ Interesting choice of weapons+ Strong voice acting and good writing+ Fantastic original songsWhat you may not like:- The character feels heavy and slow while the game is purely beat-em up gameplay style. Would have been much better if the pacing was faster.- Could've used some platforming.- Some later weapons in the game are much overpowered and will replace your upgraded starting weapon. Could've used some balancing here.			",156,39,1,21,16,1,9

												Four hours into this game and it's definitely worth saying a few things. I'll start with the graphics only because the style in which this world is built is breathtaking. The art direction is watercolours, and do they ever add a fluidity to the movements of The Kid, the silent protagonist of whom you are controlling in this adventure. The colours themselves either have an undeniable shine to them that gently turn into black and white as your health decreases. So does your vision, which I found to be a great mechanic to have.The story is unique in where a narrator occassionally comments on your actions, while giving the player a sense of direction of where they are going and why. Honestly it's the only sense of direction you are likely to receive, given as to how each level is ""summoned"" step by step.A final word would be on the soundtrack. It goes with the game perfectly. What else is there to say?Get yourself this game if you're a fan of Adventure games!			",63,1,0,8,4,0,29

												SO much fun. Really unique design - in most places the level creates itself as you walk. Innovative and very visually satisfying. Can only carry two weapons at a time, but it works for the mechanics here, because you can choose which ones are best for the level/enemies you're up against. Soundtrack is great - songs stuck in my head for hours but I don't mind :)  The best part of this game though has to be that narrator giving a play by play of everything you do. Especially near the beginning you'll be laughing out loud. What a great time!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bastion: The first game made by Supergiant Games. Also the first amazing game they created.Bastion's a hack and slash action-adventure game, and a great one at that. You play as ""The Kid"", who stumbles upon the Bastion after the Calamity's wiped pretty much everything out. Your job? Restore the Bastion. You'll go through a relatively short, but well written story, with a small amount of replayability and lots of challenges along the way.Pros: -Great soundtrack-Great story-The game looks amazing with the color/lighting scheme-Amazing narration-Somewhat challenging achievements for the completionist-Many different ways to play the game, from difficulty to weaponsCons:-Not too much replayability - After NG+/Score Attack, you're pretty much done.Overall:Easily in my Top 10 Favorite Games. A great soundtrack + stellar narration + variety of playstyles + a great story + a fantastic looking game? That's a combo for a successful game right there. At $15, it might seem slightly overpriced, but take my word for it - It's not. That said, if you can pick it up for even a penny less, do so, as you for sure won't regret it.  ",261,66,2,23,18,2,20

												One of my all time favorite games.  Bastion tells the tale of ""The Kid"", (possibly) a young man waking up in the aftermath of what's deemed ""The Calamity,"" a disaster that overtook the entirety of Caelondia.  From there, you're on a journey to restore the Bastion, a place of sanctuary for when the situation arose.The story creates a perfect world where details are up to the player's interpretation, being quite scarce and vague overall on the land itself, and the landmarks which litter it.  Throughout the game, you're given a beautifully executed narrative by Logan Cunningham, who - with every step of the way - informs you of your progress as you roll along, and provides interesting pieces that could tell a thing or two about the land's past, or your own. The game is played from an Isometric perspective, with that being the camera being held at around an seventy-five degree angle.  Gameplay can often be mixed up to however your choosing with two weapon slots for you to make use of. Two melee weapons or two devastating range weapons?  Sure, why not. The game can provide wider mix of playstyles as well, having access to a special skill to make use of between your two weapons, it can turn the tide of battle in your favor.  Furthermore, the game can give you special ""tonics"" that you can equip within the game's Distillery that can give you a boost to help your survive longer in battle, or to compliment your playstyle of being at a distance or up close.With it's hand drawn art, intricate story, fairly diverse gameplay, deep narrative, and great soundtrack, I'd say this game is well worth the money you put into it.

												This game... I don't even have words to describe the adventure this game provided me. To be honest, all I can say is that this game is amazing, but that's a pure understatement. For a quick summary of Bastion, the plot follows the main character, known as ""The Kid"" as he wakes up after the calamity has taken place. The calamity is an event which reduced most people and the world to ash and rubble. He takes off towards the Bastion where he will go off to get cores to power up the Bastion so that he can fix the calamity.The gameplay of the game is extremely engaging and keeps the players on their toes, even when playing the game on the easiest setting. You will find yourself constantly rolling and trying to avoid enemy attacks, and searching levels for health potions over and over again. The enemies do become harder, but thankfully not the point that I would call this  a Dark Souls game. [ THANK THE LORD!!! ]The main point I love about Bastion is the story. It keeps the players interested and compels you to play more and more so you can find out what happens next or find out what happened before the game had begun. I will not say too much however, but the story truly is beautiful.And I cannot leave out the next best thing, the music. I just don't know what to say about it. It is extremely fitting, and has a nice tune and beat to it, and always seems right for the situation you find yourself to be in, whether a fierce battle, or simply roaming around the Bastion and talking to people.Overall, I would like to say that this game is great, but it's not. It's a bloody masterpiece and one that I must say, will outlive many. This is a MUST for gamers everywhere. This game... Is just... Beautiful.			",99,11,3,12,5,0,4

												To me, a gaming masterpeice is a game which can entertain any sort of gamer. Bastion could be titled a gaming masterpeice, much like Dust: An Elysian Tail. It's gameplay core and mechanics are solid, and is good enough to keep you nice and entertained for a couple hours in one session, and the gold narration and storytelling is only there to refine and back it up. These two combined can result to some pretty damn nice immersion, which is a thing some games fail at doing, and some succeed at. Bastion succeeded and went over the charts.The only things I don't like about the game are very small nitpicks, like not being able to replay levels the player enjoyed, but that also gives the game a good sense of progression, to counter that nitpick.If you're a fan of both good, addictive beat-em-up gameplay and storytelling bundled into a nice package, then Bastion is for you. I was put off by the fact it was 2D at first glance, but the game itself completely turned my stereotypes upside down, and that's a damn achivement in it's own right.			",69,9,0,7,2,0,2

												Bastion is, without a doubt, the best hack n slash game I have ever played, and it certainly makes my top 5 overall. This incredibly sensitive, character-laden tale is fun, relaxing, perfectly-crafted, and has one of the most touching stories I've ever played. Not many games would get a 10/10 rating from me, but this one undoubtedly deserves it. Worth double the standard price, if you haven't played this, you haven't experienced what video games can offer.			",124,14,1,16,12,2,14

												Quite an amazing indie title. [Scroll down for Intro, Pros, Cons, Pseudocons, and Conclusion]Intro:Its controls are simple and utilitarian, anyone could pick it up and have a good time. Sometimes it's bad if a game is too easy; but I've never once felt that Bastion was too easy. Bastion is a piece of art which drops you (literally, often) into the middle of ""The Calamity"", which destroyed this town of yours, which you are completely unfamiliar with. The storyline is explained through narration. The narration, which reminds me a bit of Ron Perlman (Fallout narrator and actor), is extremely well done and the narrator himself is given his own characterization. Your own character never talks, but the narrator speaks through you, always in the past tense. When you do certain things, the narrator reacts. I chose a bone-repeater and a War Machete, and the narrator commented that weapons don't have to be complicated to be effective [along those lines, at least].The upgrade system for weapons is based on levels which are increased by finding one material and spending some in-game currency; and with each level you can choose one of two traits and it is always available to change it back. The distillery allows you to keep two drinks, but since only beneficial drinks were able to be served in town (I like it when the devs describe game mechanics, even if it isn't perfect. It adds character to the town) you can choose perks from the drinks, including an increased crit rate at full health, more health, a larger radius to collect money, instant crits at very low health, and many more which I have forgotten or not unlocked.The story keeps me intrigued, with this mysterious town, and my gradual learning of what happened. I am excited to play more.Pros:Nice artwork, simple fighting and controls, non-punishing mechanics, nice story, cool narrator. A nice variety of combat choices. It isn't ever edgy, inappropriate, or brutally violent for no reason. Kid friendly, but was designed for adults. Many challenges and upgrades to work for.Cons: It's an easy game, which would bore me if it wasn't a good game.Pseudocons [NOTE: These are cons which I included to warn those that may not like this particular developer's choice. I love Fallout 3, for instance, but some may hate that you can't earn every perk and get 100% in every skill] : A very basic level-up system, which has no real permanent choices. There is no real choice in the storyline, ie, it is linear. Most of the game is just mashing click to attack, right click to range-attack, shift to block/parry, and f to heal: potentially repetitive combat.Conclusion: If you are new to Video Games, or if you are a veteran, you'd like it. Great gift for kids or your S.O.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I recently reviewed this game for my game review blog, Five Penny Review. If you enjoy this review, please visit my page:http://fivepennyreview.blogspot.com/2013/04/bastion.htmlWhat sets this game apart?Conceptually, Bastion could be considered a fairly typical action RPG.  It features a silent protagonist, a small cast of enemies, a selection of weapons for which you develop new skills as you progress, and a combat system heavy on combos and dodge rolling.  What makes it unique is its presentation, and to say that Bastion is an artistic endeavor would be an understatement.  The art creates a world somewhere between catastrophe and storybook, the music has a multicultural feel that creates something familiar but foreign.  The only character to speak is the narrator, who is a constant presence in the game and provides information about the world, the characters, and your course of action, serving as both storyteller and tutorial.  The way this was accomplished creates an experience that envelops you in what would otherwise be a decent game.What is the difficulty factor?The tutorials for Bastion are pretty straight forward, and the controls are fairly simple to pick up and play.  The narrator also does a good job providing little hints for moving forward, especially early in the game.  The timing for dodge rolling, blocking with your shield, and even just attacking can take some time to master and feel a bit clumsy, especially given the differences in the available weapons.  The weapon proving grounds provide a good method for mastering the techniques for various weapons.As far as the challenge curve goes, Bastion does a great job of starting off easy and escalating slowly to a proper difficulty.  The proving grounds and dream sequences allow you to build up your level and money, often while earning new techniques.  If you aren’t feeling challenged, the shrine allows you to drastically increase the difficulty of specific aspects of the game to increase your rewards, allowing you to customize the difficulty of the game in a unique way.Does it use media effectively?Bastion has a very stylized appearance that gives it a persistent otherworldly feeling, like you are experiencing a dream or watching the illustrations of a story book.  The enemies and foreground objects are often strange and brightly colored, the world itself is made up of chunks of ground floating in mid-air that form as you progress, and the backgrounds consist of little more than gradient colors and clouds.  The culmination of this look is a sense of nihilistic beauty, which seems appropriate in drawing the audience in to the story of the survivors of a world shattering apocalypse.The music in Bastion is a bit hard to describe, both because of its occasional strangeness and the obvious scope of its influences.  At its core there is often a folksy acoustic guitar, but many of the tracks feature distinctly eastern sounds as well.  The lyrics are simple and poignant, and the vocal tracks have a haunting beauty to them.  Ultimately, the music has the same effect as the visuals, to draw you in to a place that is both alien and beautiful, and reminding you of what has been lost to the world you explore.Best moment in the game?While not a specific moment, the best thing about this game to me was Rucks, the narrator.  Voice actor Logan Cunningham did a great job creating a character that sounded familiar and warm, further connecting you to what could otherwise be a somewhat alien world.  Rucks serves as a storyteller and historian for the viewer as the game progresses, serving as the medium for each major plot point in the game, and telling you about the history of places, events, and character as they become relevant to the story.  In addition, he provides commentary as you move through each level.  There is something shocking about the first time you hear Rucks provide commentary on what is happening in the course of a battle, something that seems like it could not be scripted, but obviously must be.Who needs to play this game?Once again, I would encourage all brands of gamer to check out this game.  Bastion uses great art, music, and storytelling to create an environment that you can be drawn into.  The action may not always be on par with some modern titles and parts of the game may not feel especially challenging, but the gameplay is always fun and the sliding difficulty scale will help keep you under pressure.  Bastion is available to purchase and download on the X-Box Live Arcade and on Steam.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Abstract"" ""Indie"" games is where all the (K)ool Kids are. Just about recently, gamers are regularly met with a surfeit of these indie games that have a history of HYPE. Too bad most of them turn out to be vaporware or pretentious garbage. But there is that minute gleam of light that promises quality. Supergiant Games, thankfully, ends up being one of the few that actually develop decent games. Bastion, the game in question, is not one that should be adjudged ""decent"", but rather, astounding. Far from flawless, as this game is locked at 30 frames (Just, why?), but an overall stellar game that is worth every penny, or whatever crap currency you wield.Meet the Kid. One of the handful of survivors that has endured the Calamity. This catastrophic event brought the whole world to ruin. He sets off to the Bastion, where he is greeted by Rucks, the Stranger, with words claiming that the recent disaster can be undone. By constructing the Bastion back to health with monument cores and shards there are odds of restoring Caelondia and its neighbor lands to a time before hell unleashed, hence the title of this game. Throughout the Kid's travels to seek out the materials needed, players will learn more about the world and its people and you get to learn the backstories of the few survivors you come across as the game progresses. It might seem engrossing, but the story is where Bastion falls shortest. The journey with the Kid was complete in every angle it is viewed in, but it was also rushed from start to end, and had inadequate time to develop. Build-up starts to occur profusely around the last third of the game, only to conclude in some half-baked ending that proved to be unfufilling. Despite the mediocre narrative, Bastion is a feast for the eyes and ears due to it's gorgeous presentation.It is not an overstatement when it is said that this game has the potential to be sold solely on it's presentation. Hell, some have avowed that they bought the soundtrack before the damn game. It's just that damn delicious. Bastion's visuals is where that abstract tag comes into play, because it is most certainly what most reckon to be unconventional. The playing stage constructs itself as you tread along the path and the camera is complimented by a shiny filter, and other things I won't bother typing as it's better experienced than read. The soundtrack, done by composer Darren Korb, is brimful with impressive songs that seemlessly attach to the rest of the presentation. I'm not one that gushes over video game OSTs, but this one is pretty damn good, and I'm convinced everyone that isn't a moron agrees.If only it wasn't locked at thirty frames...that idea bothers me way to f****** much.Even with such wondrous superficial values, a game is crap if it isn't fun, and it is relieving to know that Bastion succeeds in this fundamental aspect too. Not much can be said about it however, it's just the average action-adventure game with a few tweaks that enable it to distinguish itself from the rest. The Kid can be equipped with 2 weapons at once and he has a ""secret"" move, and by, of course, playing the game (no way), the Kid is met with unlocks in his arsenal and attributes that gradually form him to an impetus of destruction by the end of the game. Sounds a little, unamusing, but this is without the mention of the copious ways one can up their game. The game played vanilla is laughably easy, but there are shrine idols that can unexpectedly rise its difficulty, which is recommended. There are also Vigils to complete for moneys, and wave-based side missions to earn more moneys and achievements, and a New Game Plus option that actually bears fruit! All of this will keep many entertained for a appreciable amount of time, around 20 hours or so maximum.There's more to be said, but I'm done. Bastion is a worthwhile game that I'm sure many have already invested their time in, and I hope people continue to pick this up. Supergiant Games is a talented developer, and they only demonstrate so with this installation. Where it fails in storytelling makes up in well-done game-structure and incredible graphics and sound. I'm looking foward to playing more entries from this group.Still haven't played Transistor at the time of this review, so I need to get to that quick.			",118,26,1,18,9,3,14

It's pretty, the music is absolutely moving, the story is deep and intricate, the characters have history and motives which lends an immense amount of gravitas to the incredibly touching finale.This game is a masterpiece.

												I just finished this game for the first time. The last stage was a rollercoaster of feelings and morality in the best possible way. But I'm getting ahead of myself...The gameplay? Simple enough. You take two weapons and use them to destroy things. Each weapon usually has a couple different things they can do, but you can use any combination of two, plus a ""secret attack,"" which is a special move that is either related to one of your weapons or a special attack in itself. You also have access to a shield that can block or reflect attacks, and your character isn't half bad at dodge rolling either.As for the story? Well, I'm sure everyone's heard of the fantastic narrator. You, as the Kid, are tasked with travelling about a world torn asunder by the Calamity and finding Cores to put into a monument in the middle of the Bastion. And for what? Hell, I'm not gonna tell you. Figure it out yourself, but be warned that the story is pretty damn feels inducing. Lots of tear jerkers, sad and glad alike.Just remember to keep moving forwards. The past is the past, and you should focus on the future. ^^			",58,6,0,10,1,0,7

												Do you want a new and exciting game? Look no further. There is no imitation, Bastion is unique in many ways and for it, it is a breath of fresh air. I cannot say how grateful I am for the release of this game. It helped me enjoy gaming again in a sea of sameness and overdone sequels.The mechanics are simple enough to learn, but complex enough to enjoy. The mix of upgrading weapons, using different potion upgrades and adding different gods in the shrine make for unique challenges throughout.The story is bizarre in a way, but everything is explained with enough context through out so that you keep pushing to learn more and more, eventually feeling sad for what they had brought upon themselves.

												I became interested in 'Bastion' when I first saw its beautiful illustrations. The artwork was so stunning that I intended to play the game purely for its art direction. However, within moments of beginning the game, I found myself captivated by the narrator (who tells the story in a 'Shawshank Redemption'-like style) and immersed in the game mechanics. The story of Bastion unfolded steadily and controls were explained so clearly that it was difficult to put this game down. Easily one of my favourites, I strongly recommend Bastion and prefer it over 'Transistor'.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What do you say to someone who’s played it all?“Buy this game. Please.”	Bastion is one of the “big names” of the Indie scene. Although its reach has gone farther than most games made by small companies thanks to a partnership between Supergiant Games and Warner Brothers, Bastion still has the charm that only a small-time game can. From the graphics to the gameplay, the music to the narration, you know you’ve found something special from the moment the game begins.	The game follows the story of a boy known only as “the Kid” following a catastrophic event called the Calamity. With the world falling to pieces, it’s up to the Kid to collect cores to rebuild the bastion and restore life. An old man known as Rucks narrates the story as it plays out. Along the way, the Kid must fight off monsters, enemies, and even nature itself to retrieve the cores and save the bastion, with a few surprises along the way.	Artistically, Bastion is a gem. Jen Zee’s artwork gives the world an organic, colorful feeling that constantly evolves around the player’s actions. The soundtrack, composed by Darren Korb, is as beautiful as it is fitting for the game’s story. With a very down-to-earth feel and haunting lyrics on a number of tracks, the soundtrack makes for good listening both in and out of the game. Better yet, it’s also available for purchase on the Steam marketplace.	In respects to gameplay, Bastion is a generally easy game. I had little difficulty making my way through on my first play-through, and never encountered a game over. That being said, the “Shrine” portion of the game allows players to raise the difficulty in exchange for more fragments (currency used for upgrades and purchases) and XP. With that in mind, the game can be made as easy or as difficult as the player would like, with the best benefits reserved for those who play the hardest.	What Bastion is known for most of all is its narrator, Rucks, who narrates the game’s events as they play out. The old, weathered voice of the man gives a dimension to the game that few others can hold a flame to. His voice guides players through the plot at several key points, but is also free-flowing at other instances. Rucks might comment on the weapons the Kid uses, offer hints when needed, and even comment on little things such as falling off the stage. The story is framed as Zucks telling the story--to whom? That comes in time.	Bastion is a gem, and for good reasons. Its fascinating story is told through every medium--art, music, and plot--and culminates in one fantastic experience. If you have the opportunity to experience Bastion, do so.			",368,166,7,56,44,3,78

												I couldn't wait to play this game, and when I did, I wasn't disappointed, the narrator speaking through the game is very creative, and fresh, and I always liked hearing him talk about what I was doing, the graphics are pretty and colourful too The story and gameplay are seamless but it was a little too short for me. If you take away the narrator you realise all you're doing is killing everything while moving from one place to another and the story isn't actually as brilliant (but still damn good) as everyone says. But that in no way stops this game from being worth my money, try the demo first.			",164,26,0,32,14,0,13

												This game's hand-drawn art combines beautifully with it's famous narrative style of storytelling as you play through the floating world of Caelondia. It's gameplay is very enjoyable, with a variety of weapons for you to find and carry on your adventures, from muskets to machetes. The featured town/shop system  is very straighforward and easy to get used to. The only thing I can even say I didn't like about this game was the in-game player model. He seemed out-of-place with the rest of the world, as his animation was different. Aside from that, would definitely recommend for you to buy it. 8.5/10			",79,9,0,10,3,0,3

												A unique action packed indie game that is voiced by an epic narrator. The story line and gameplay are absolutely amazing, which is all voiced of course. You have a variety of weapons that all help in various sticky situations from the precise and deadly bow to the devastating hand cannon. Music and controls are excellent. Definitely a must-have indie game. What are you waiting for? Get this game now and see for yourself :D.			",87,10,0,7,4,1,3

												I very rarely play games to the end twice. In two days. It's a rather short game, a good 4 hours of play time. But those 4 hours are filled to the brim with a wonderful story, interesting characters, fun combat, epic music and a deep storyteller voice to frame it all up. All in all it's one of my dear favorites, and within good reason.Bastion is a must play for any dungeon-crawler or RPG fan.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Love this game! The art, game style, and story are top notch. I wouldn't necessarily class this as an ARPG, more of a beat-em-up with some RPG elements. If you can't make it through a level, there are some things you can change that may make it easier: change potions you are drinking, upgrade weapons, change weapons, get new secret skills, remove some of the shrines.Recommended for anyone who likes ARPGs, anime, or beat-em-ups.

												This is a very good game overall.The gameplay is fun, though it might become a bit repetitive, but the developers try to avoid this by giving you new weapons throughout the whole game. The weapons are easy to use and quite fun aswell.The storytelling is definitely the most solid part of this game. The narrator uses his GOD DAMM FANTASTIC voice to voice over everything you do. I.E: when you defeat an enemy with no problems he will comment on that, or if you keep falling off the map, he will tell you that you are stupid. The narrator tells also the story, which is quite good and very engaging.The art style is gorgeus. You can spend minutes just looking at some of the sceneries that you are shown. Just beautiful.As I said, it´s a very enjoyable game and you should totally purchase it.			",64,12,4,3,10,0,4

The replayability in this game is great, you can try to go trough the campaing choosing different choices, weapons, or power ups. There is also multiple achievement to try to get that make this game much more interesting.

												I recently reviewed this game for my game review blog, Five Penny Review. If you enjoy this review, please visit my page:http://fivepennyreview.blogspot.com/2013/04/bastion.htmlWhat sets this game apart?Conceptually, Bastion could be considered a fairly typical action RPG.  It features a silent protagonist, a small cast of enemies, a selection of weapons for which you develop new skills as you progress, and a combat system heavy on combos and dodge rolling.  What makes it unique is its presentation, and to say that Bastion is an artistic endeavor would be an understatement.  The art creates a world somewhere between catastrophe and storybook, the music has a multicultural feel that creates something familiar but foreign.  The only character to speak is the narrator, who is a constant presence in the game and provides information about the world, the characters, and your course of action, serving as both storyteller and tutorial.  The way this was accomplished creates an experience that envelops you in what would otherwise be a decent game.What is the difficulty factor?The tutorials for Bastion are pretty straight forward, and the controls are fairly simple to pick up and play.  The narrator also does a good job providing little hints for moving forward, especially early in the game.  The timing for dodge rolling, blocking with your shield, and even just attacking can take some time to master and feel a bit clumsy, especially given the differences in the available weapons.  The weapon proving grounds provide a good method for mastering the techniques for various weapons.As far as the challenge curve goes, Bastion does a great job of starting off easy and escalating slowly to a proper difficulty.  The proving grounds and dream sequences allow you to build up your level and money, often while earning new techniques.  If you aren’t feeling challenged, the shrine allows you to drastically increase the difficulty of specific aspects of the game to increase your rewards, allowing you to customize the difficulty of the game in a unique way.Does it use media effectively?Bastion has a very stylized appearance that gives it a persistent otherworldly feeling, like you are experiencing a dream or watching the illustrations of a story book.  The enemies and foreground objects are often strange and brightly colored, the world itself is made up of chunks of ground floating in mid-air that form as you progress, and the backgrounds consist of little more than gradient colors and clouds.  The culmination of this look is a sense of nihilistic beauty, which seems appropriate in drawing the audience in to the story of the survivors of a world shattering apocalypse.The music in Bastion is a bit hard to describe, both because of its occasional strangeness and the obvious scope of its influences.  At its core there is often a folksy acoustic guitar, but many of the tracks feature distinctly eastern sounds as well.  The lyrics are simple and poignant, and the vocal tracks have a haunting beauty to them.  Ultimately, the music has the same effect as the visuals, to draw you in to a place that is both alien and beautiful, and reminding you of what has been lost to the world you explore.Best moment in the game?While not a specific moment, the best thing about this game to me was Rucks, the narrator.  Voice actor Logan Cunningham did a great job creating a character that sounded familiar and warm, further connecting you to what could otherwise be a somewhat alien world.  Rucks serves as a storyteller and historian for the viewer as the game progresses, serving as the medium for each major plot point in the game, and telling you about the history of places, events, and character as they become relevant to the story.  In addition, he provides commentary as you move through each level.  There is something shocking about the first time you hear Rucks provide commentary on what is happening in the course of a battle, something that seems like it could not be scripted, but obviously must be.Who needs to play this game?Once again, I would encourage all brands of gamer to check out this game.  Bastion uses great art, music, and storytelling to create an environment that you can be drawn into.  The action may not always be on par with some modern titles and parts of the game may not feel especially challenging, but the gameplay is always fun and the sliding difficulty scale will help keep you under pressure.  Bastion is available to purchase and download on the X-Box Live Arcade and on Steam.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quite an amazing indie title. [Scroll down for Intro, Pros, Cons, Pseudocons, and Conclusion]Intro:Its controls are simple and utilitarian, anyone could pick it up and have a good time. Sometimes it's bad if a game is too easy; but I've never once felt that Bastion was too easy. Bastion is a piece of art which drops you (literally, often) into the middle of ""The Calamity"", which destroyed this town of yours, which you are completely unfamiliar with. The storyline is explained through narration. The narration, which reminds me a bit of Ron Perlman (Fallout narrator and actor), is extremely well done and the narrator himself is given his own characterization. Your own character never talks, but the narrator speaks through you, always in the past tense. When you do certain things, the narrator reacts. I chose a bone-repeater and a War Machete, and the narrator commented that weapons don't have to be complicated to be effective [along those lines, at least].The upgrade system for weapons is based on levels which are increased by finding one material and spending some in-game currency; and with each level you can choose one of two traits and it is always available to change it back. The distillery allows you to keep two drinks, but since only beneficial drinks were able to be served in town (I like it when the devs describe game mechanics, even if it isn't perfect. It adds character to the town) you can choose perks from the drinks, including an increased crit rate at full health, more health, a larger radius to collect money, instant crits at very low health, and many more which I have forgotten or not unlocked.The story keeps me intrigued, with this mysterious town, and my gradual learning of what happened. I am excited to play more.Pros:Nice artwork, simple fighting and controls, non-punishing mechanics, nice story, cool narrator. A nice variety of combat choices. It isn't ever edgy, inappropriate, or brutally violent for no reason. Kid friendly, but was designed for adults. Many challenges and upgrades to work for.Cons: It's an easy game, which would bore me if it wasn't a good game.Pseudocons [NOTE: These are cons which I included to warn those that may not like this particular developer's choice. I love Fallout 3, for instance, but some may hate that you can't earn every perk and get 100% in every skill] : A very basic level-up system, which has no real permanent choices. There is no real choice in the storyline, ie, it is linear. Most of the game is just mashing click to attack, right click to range-attack, shift to block/parry, and f to heal: potentially repetitive combat.Conclusion: If you are new to Video Games, or if you are a veteran, you'd like it. Great gift for kids or your S.O.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bastion is a fine action-adventure game set in a fantastic world after a near apocalyptic event. The scenery is superb, beautiful places that show some of this world's former glory. The gameplay is quite varied, as there is a wide variety of weapons, each with their respective upgrades and secret skills, that you can combine in every way you want. You can also customize the difficulty by invoking different gods that will make foes stronger in a variety of ways, while providing you with greater rewards.The soundtrack is another strong point for this game. Each song seems fitting to the situation you're currently in, and there's plenty of them.Finally, the story is very well crafted. The narration aspect is quite interesting, and as you progress, it begins to make more and more sense. Not to mention that a second playthrough, in New Game+, will add new details.All in all, a highly recommendable game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To me, a gaming masterpeice is a game which can entertain any sort of gamer. Bastion could be titled a gaming masterpeice, much like Dust: An Elysian Tail. It's gameplay core and mechanics are solid, and is good enough to keep you nice and entertained for a couple hours in one session, and the gold narration and storytelling is only there to refine and back it up. These two combined can result to some pretty damn nice immersion, which is a thing some games fail at doing, and some succeed at. Bastion succeeded and went over the charts.The only things I don't like about the game are very small nitpicks, like not being able to replay levels the player enjoyed, but that also gives the game a good sense of progression, to counter that nitpick.If you're a fan of both good, addictive beat-em-up gameplay and storytelling bundled into a nice package, then Bastion is for you. I was put off by the fact it was 2D at first glance, but the game itself completely turned my stereotypes upside down, and that's a damn achivement in it's own right.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You wake up to find your world in pieces. Wordlessly, you get up in search of the one place everyone has agreed to go to in times of trouble... The Bastion.Bastion is an Action-RPG with an isometric point of view. You play as a white-haired youth only referred to as ""The Kid,"" and traverse vast, various landscapes in search of ""Cores"" to power the Bastion.Nowadays, it's tough to combine gameplay and story together without having the two separated from one another. Bastion solves that problem by the deft use of (incredibly deep and sexy) narration as you play the game, helped by Logan Cunningham's performance. Almost everything you do in-game will be commented on by the narrator. And the narration NEVER gets annoying.Bastion is an excellent example of how a game can captivate the player with its engaging plot and intense gameplay. For those looking for an experience, Bastion will most certainly deliver.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of my all time favorite games.  Bastion tells the tale of ""The Kid"", (possibly) a young man waking up in the aftermath of what's deemed ""The Calamity,"" a disaster that overtook the entirety of Caelondia.  From there, you're on a journey to restore the Bastion, a place of sanctuary for when the situation arose.The story creates a perfect world where details are up to the player's interpretation, being quite scarce and vague overall on the land itself, and the landmarks which litter it.  Throughout the game, you're given a beautifully executed narrative by Logan Cunningham, who - with every step of the way - informs you of your progress as you roll along, and provides interesting pieces that could tell a thing or two about the land's past, or your own. The game is played from an Isometric perspective, with that being the camera being held at around an seventy-five degree angle.  Gameplay can often be mixed up to however your choosing with two weapon slots for you to make use of. Two melee weapons or two devastating range weapons?  Sure, why not. The game can provide wider mix of playstyles as well, having access to a special skill to make use of between your two weapons, it can turn the tide of battle in your favor.  Furthermore, the game can give you special ""tonics"" that you can equip within the game's Distillery that can give you a boost to help your survive longer in battle, or to compliment your playstyle of being at a distance or up close.With it's hand drawn art, intricate story, fairly diverse gameplay, deep narrative, and great soundtrack, I'd say this game is well worth the money you put into it.

												It is a good game. I'd give it 8 / 10Bastion is an isometric action beatem up game which has unique visual art and story narration.What you will like:+ Very attractive visuals.+ Solid gameplay mechanics+ Story narration is unique (at least used to be in 2011)+ Interesting choice of weapons+ Strong voice acting and good writing+ Fantastic original songsWhat you may not like:- The character feels heavy and slow while the game is purely beat-em up gameplay style. Would have been much better if the pacing was faster.- Could've used some platforming.- Some later weapons in the game are much overpowered and will replace your upgraded starting weapon. Could've used some balancing here.			",156,39,1,21,16,1,9

												Four hours into this game and it's definitely worth saying a few things. I'll start with the graphics only because the style in which this world is built is breathtaking. The art direction is watercolours, and do they ever add a fluidity to the movements of The Kid, the silent protagonist of whom you are controlling in this adventure. The colours themselves either have an undeniable shine to them that gently turn into black and white as your health decreases. So does your vision, which I found to be a great mechanic to have.The story is unique in where a narrator occassionally comments on your actions, while giving the player a sense of direction of where they are going and why. Honestly it's the only sense of direction you are likely to receive, given as to how each level is ""summoned"" step by step.A final word would be on the soundtrack. It goes with the game perfectly. What else is there to say?Get yourself this game if you're a fan of Adventure games!			",63,1,0,8,4,0,29

												SO much fun. Really unique design - in most places the level creates itself as you walk. Innovative and very visually satisfying. Can only carry two weapons at a time, but it works for the mechanics here, because you can choose which ones are best for the level/enemies you're up against. Soundtrack is great - songs stuck in my head for hours but I don't mind :)  The best part of this game though has to be that narrator giving a play by play of everything you do. Especially near the beginning you'll be laughing out loud. What a great time!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Play this Game.I bought Bastion back when it first showed up on Steam and I played a while but I never got the chance to finish. Recently I was looking for something different to play so I thought I'd fire Bastion up again and give it a play through. I love this game.Bastion is about a boy who ""wakes up"" in the middle of what the game calls the Calamity. Your story is narrated as you (this boy) progress through levels that build themselves around you. This should not be confused with procedurally generated levels, rather there's a hint of where a path should be and as you move, tiles form up around you. This is a pretty cool effect even if it's totally linnear. As you progress the story deepens, you find new weapons, upgrades, secrets etc. to battle your way through the game's enemies with a goal of restoring the Bastion, the game's home point. I never found the combat to be particularly challenging, with enemies brodacatsting attacks well before they happen and picking up fairly predictable patterns to counter. Your weapons and skills are more than strong enough to handle everything the game throws at you. You will have the opportunity to make things harder on yourself as you complete more peices of the Bastion if you wish. Weapons can be upgraded at the Bastion's forge, adding extra damage, or critical chance etc. You'll also be able to switch out skills and buy power up type items to help you along. And at the end you'll get to unlock a new game plus mode which adds a little replayability.Level design is pretty cool, as I mentioned above the world forms around you as you move along. Sometimes leading to dead ends, sometimes leading to secret areas containing upgrade materials, or new story items, even companion type characters. It's worth exploring every corner you can in these well built, beautifully rendered, but often very small areas. The story itself is at first just a narration of what you do as the game's hero character, but soon enough you'll start to feel it coalescing into something bigger. As you play, the game's narrator continues to tell the stories of the boy and various survivors of the calamity. This takes place in the game itself along with aquiring items to learn about and that help tell the history of the Bastion and it's home world and the people who inhabit it. Once things begin to move the story progresses quickly and in my opinion is told pretty masterfully. Now, Ive heard of people complaining about the narration of the game. Saying that he's too involved, or too in your face. That he never shuts up and they just want to play the game. I'm sorry to say that you can't shut the narrator off for those of you who may find him annoying. But on the other hand, he's the one telling the story, and Bastion is a story driven game so you need the narrator. I personally loved listening to him, the voice is pleasant, smooth and to me at least was nothing close to invasive. The narrator is integral to the game's story being told so you'll just have to deal with it and even if you don't like listeing to him I'm sure as things go on you'll at least be interested in what he has to say. The story itself is emotial, fairly deep and told really really well.As is usual these days the game is short, around 6 hours I think total with potential of a couple more if you complete the optional mini games. But the fact is the story is fully told in this time, so you get a feeling of completion even though you it's a short play through, and with new game plus you can double the play value and still have fun.Bastion, also has an epic sound track. ""Zia's song"", and the end theme ""Coming Home"" are two that stick out in my head. I believe the game even comes with a copy of the sound track if I remember corrctly. In conclusion, Bastion, is a beautiful, short, story driven game with an excellent story and great original music. It's inexpensive and worth a play through. Give it shot I'm sure you'll dig it.

												This has to be one of the best games I have ever played, it was a random buy and I didnt think much of it until I played it. It is a dungeon crawler but also so much more, the story is fantastic and with great characters and enemies. But the best parts about this is the world and the music/ voice acting, the narrating is genious and makes this stand out from other games like this, the music fits perfect and I had to go back and buy the soundtrack after playing this, and not forgetting the world, it is beautiful, colorful and varying. Some of the choices makes you want to replay it to see what could have been, something I recommend because it is not the longest game.			",79,20,5,8,6,0,3

												An isometric quasi-rpg with satisfyingly repetitive combat, and an impressive new game plus. Still, Bastion is more than that. Bastion is all about its narrative, through music and spoken word, the true soul of this game lies in its somber self-awareness as it cooly reveals itself to you by way of storytelling. Great port, great on KBM or gamepads, and won't break your wallet. Buy this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game evokes such a unique aesthetic that is both refreshing and engaging. Although I feel the controls/combat system leave a lot to be wanted, I feel as though the game is more about storytelling that it necessarily is about fighting.I'm overall highly impressed with the game, and would recommend it to anyone - if not for the gameplay, the music can just as easily immerse you in this environment.

												Finished it in 6,5 hours. Well worth the money, even though I think it's a bit short in the end (storywise). The graphics are outstanding by the way. They reminded me of Braid.The game itself plays like a linear action RPG. During your quest you'll receive lots of weapons, that you can upgrade several times. There are also idols to increase the difficulty, a distillery to equip potions with different effects and challenge rooms to earn extra items. There really is a lot to do in this game (never mind the story for now) so it could take you about 12-13 hours, maybe even longer, to 100% this game.To be short: this game should be in your collection, no matter what.[Rating: 88/100]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This was honestly one of the most amazing games I've ever played. I loved how they chose to tell the story through the narrator, the music is great and the game looked beautiful. Near the end, it gave me one of the hardest decisions I've ever had to make. As I was sitting there with the credits rolling, all I could do was sit there. It gave me the most indescribable feeling knowing that I finished it and the game was over (except for the new game+, that is). Tell your friends to buy it, tell your family, tell your dog because this is the greatest game I've finished in a while. It doesn't even cost that much, $15 normally, though I got it for $4 (I think? Somewhere around there) during the Steam summer sale. If you're thinking about getting this game, please do. You won't regret it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Yeah, yeah, it's super-good. The graphical style and narration are brilliant. Most of the gameplay is Zelda-style timing combat (parry, dodge, aim, strike, in varying combinations) but thankfully doesn't rely on ever retreading ground. The gameplay is probably the only issue - it starts to wear thin after awhile, and moments with lots of enemies often turn too messy to be fun - but the game is still absolutely worth it The story can drag a bit at points, but when it's on, it's on - easily one of the most emotional experiences I've had since... what, Silent Hill 2?Buy it, it's worth experiencing.

Proper review supposed to start at the beginning... Ain't so simple with this one	Get Bastion. Really. A discount means it's a steal for youI'm just foolingBastion is an adventure beat-em-up game with unique artstyle, superb storytelling, hypnotizing music, and a meta-ish thingy in the plotline.Bastion graphical representation used a lot of handpainted scenery, resulting in a beautiful and easy-in-the-eye kind of graphics, you won't find many game that uses this kind (well, aside from other game from Supergiant, Transistor). It'll be a different 'graphics' experience for you with BastionThe story in this game are told with a narrator as the player progresses through the Bastion world. The character player control is silent (and looks like the main character communicate with other using handwriting, as hinted by all the dialogue choices when interacting with others), and all element about Bastion are told by the narrator. The narrator did a really excellent job at delivering the world of Bastion to the player. His voice feels friendly, like someone you've known for so long, yet only meet again after a long separation. You won't feel tired listening to the narrator thoughout the game, and it is also a good thing because the way of the storytelling is unique, leaving you with a feeling of wanting to be told more.Music at the bastion is a little different with other games that usually use orchestra of violin, drum, piano or everything else. It sound like 1 or 2 instrument that playing along with a storyteller, and perfectly captures the predicament of the story being told. This fits a lot with the storytelling style of Bastion.Not much of gameplay selling point can be told here. Some people might feels the combat is repetitive, and old as there's no differentiation to other game with same type of combat. That might be true, but I find Bastion combat is at good value. The many Arsenal you'll find coupled with passive boost from Distillery and difficulty tweaker from the Shrine will kinda force you to seek new way to combat the enemy and it's good enough for me.The meta things of Bastion plot is *SPOILER AHEAD  you're supposed to choose a peculiar ending in order for your first playthrough to match with the new game +, the Restoration Protocol. Because the narrator will have some kind of deja vu telling throughout the whole new game + narration, it fits the ending. Also it can be interpreted that as the player, you are the Kid's will that never forget even after time reset itself, the Kid at first want to restore the world before the Calamity happen, but as the player see that restoring the world doesn't prevent the Calamity, on the second playthrough, you know that the correct choice is Evacuation Protocol, thus setting sail for a new home is kinda the right /good ending of Bastion. Bastion is game where a second playthrough is needed to close a loophole that might be caused by 1 ending. And it's spectacular for a game this small to have this kind of meta story.The whole narration or the story is actually Ruck telling the story to Zia about how they all come together, while waiting for the Kid to return from the Tazal Terminal at the last level, so you are playing a memory of Ruck, and the only real time moment Ruck's narrating is when we save/leave Zulf and afterward.Also, dramatic moment when you decide to rescue Zulf. The music is plain tearjerker, the tension of the situation feels heroic and out of respect, you'll struck in awe playing that part.It's finished... No matter what you decide to buy Bastion or not, you done good...The Bastion's gonna take us to a better gametimeSo long kid, Maybe I'll see you in the next one*cue Setting Sail, Coming Home music (youtube it!)

												You wake up.  Stuff's falling apart.  An old guy starts narrating as you run around trying to figure out what the dink is going on.  This is the Kid's story about the Calamity.StoryWhile the actual storyline in itself has been done before, the presentation of it feels fresh and new as you discover what exactly is happening and everyone's lives beforehand and so on.  If I must make one qualm is the story is completely narrated to you during play.  That means while you're trying not to die fighting a boss or something, there is actual story being presented and it can be difficult for those who can't multitask to be able to pay attention and lose details.  It's also incredibly short, and you'll be able to do just the story in around 3 hours (not including sidequests) though the game has a New Game+ encouraging you to play a second time through with all your assets still in check.GraphicsSprites are sharp looking, environments lush.  I think the Kid's ingame proportions look a bit off from his artwork design but eventually you get used to it.  The enemy variety was a bit lackluster, which is a fault of the game being rather on the short side unfortunetly.  Sometimes it could also be difficult to figure out what you could and couldn't walk on leading to a fall, but I could've just needed my eyes checked I have no idea since it happened to me three times.ControlsThis game was meant more for a gamepad I feel, as the keyboard just feels rather awkward overall.  You can get used to it but never feels nearly as fluid as the controller with it's precise movement.GameplayI have to admit, blowing something up with a mortar or whatnot brings a shimmer to my eye.  Everything in the game feels organic, leveling your character, using materials to upgrade your (very large) cache of weapons and equipping tonics to your character instead of armor to grant special quirks.  Again as stated earlier, due to the game being so short it's necessity you need to play through the New Game+ just to be able to upgrade everything and even unlock the rest of the achievements since you can't play through any areas except Proving Grounds or character related arenas.  The Proving Grounds force you to complete a task using the specific weapon for each area.  My main issue is the difficulty ratios for each of them are wildly different, and sometimes you cannot complete a proving ground until you fully upgrade said weapon which is a tad irritating.  God help the Machete Proving Ground and it's stupidity.  If the game ever feels too easy, you can also add in Deities or Gods onto your person which grants you an experience bonus but adds difficulty and let me tell you, the game can be impossibly ruthless with those settings on.  The main flaw I feel of the combat system is the targeting, as you automatically target the enemy closest to you, but if you wish to switch to another target, any enemy between it and them will have to be manually cycled through leading to massive headaches due to the frequency of tons of enemies being dumped on you.  This also coincides with your shield use as you have to be facing the target to be able to use it and is just best left to dodge and roll then to block.SoundAt first I wasn't too enthusiastic about the music, but it has grown on me over time and I enjoy it.  Is it the best soundtrack ever? No particularly though there are some choice tracks in there that are worth listening too.  The voice acting is also done really well with the Narrator narrating everything from what weapons you equip to if you slip off a ledge and fall on your face.ConclusionA highly enjoyable game that is unfortunately really short, New Game+ or no.  Some small tweaks here or there and it could benefit greatly.  It also has some sort of 3rd mode of play which I never attempted involving some kinda scoreboard, which indeed this game does have leaderboards that surprises me but hey, why not right?

												A great game, a friend gifted it to me and it really was a pleasure to play through. Its always a joy to listen to the narrator talk, unlike my harping girlfriend constantly talking about how I keep looking at other girls, its every single day.

												A really beautiful game! The soundtrack is gorgeous, the character design is unique, and the scenery is absolutely breathtaking. It's passionate and if you're like me, invokes deep emotion. The story is great, gameplay is fun, and the narrator is awesome. The ending of this game left me with a slightly melancholy feeling but it was the good kind. I won't deny that I definitely teared up more than once in this game. I really enjoyed this game, especially the music and art. And the story. I enjoyed everything, really.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bastion is a 2D isometric hack and slash that (unlike every other game I’ve ever played) works well with both controller and keyboard & mouse.  The first title released by indie studio, Supergiant Games, Bastion is a colorful, fast action platformer that is great for kids and adults alike.The Good:  Everything!  This game is %&@$ing amazing in every way!  The color, the way the story is told, the story itself, the music, the upgrades, the way the difficulty increases, the way new game plus is done, the artwork, the level design, the combat mechanics, the upgrades … you get the idea.  Literally everything is wonderful in this game!The Bad: The game is a little short and … Uhh … hmm, I am REALLY fishing for anything here.  OH! I got it! If you can find a way to make the hammer or machete work better than the pike I’d love to see how, the Brushers Pike/Spear is WAY better than the other two melee weapons.The Funky:  If you get it on Steam they give you a turret from the Portal games.  Talk to it and it will utter phrases such as, “sensory overload” and “location unknown.”The Verdict:  I really wish saying “10 out of 10” was not so over used because here it actually applies.  It is damn near impossible to get more entertainment for 15 bucks anywhere.  I realize this review is a bit short but the game has to be played to be understood and you’d be reading 2-3 more pages just for me to set the stage to talk about the experience that is Bastion.  Get it, play it, LOVE THE HELL OUT OF IT!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You play Kid who sets out on a mission to restore a land to which is once was. The story is what makes this one of my favorite arcade games. It is so immense and is unique is so many ways. This game extremely well done. The artwork is fantastic and the gameplay is just astounding. The game mechanics are so great, they are fairly simple and easy to grasp hold of. The narrator for this game is extremely talented, his voice is so pleasant and fits the game perfectly. The weapon system allows you make many weapon choices and combinations as well as certain and unique properties to go with those weapons. From a simple two handed hammer to what is basically a shoulder cannon that obliterates anything, the weapon system truly is amazing and fun to play around with. It also lets you choose between many traits as you progress in level. The game also provides mini challenges for each weapon which if you complete the assigned task you will rewarded with special items and secret moves for each weapon. The characters in this game is also what dragged me into this amazing game. Each one of them, even the enemies, are unique in their own way and their diffifulcty can be increased through the use of Idols which give enemies new abilities or a boost in health, damage, or their mechanics during battle. Another thing that I found neat about Bastion was that after you beat the game you can start the game from the beginning, but this time you will start out with the level your last playthrough, skills, weapons, and Idols. Overall this game is definitely a 10/10 for me.			",75,10,0,13,4,0,2

												This was honestly one of the most amazing games I've ever played. I loved how they chose to tell the story through the narrator, the music is great and the game looked beautiful. Near the end, it gave me one of the hardest decisions I've ever had to make. As I was sitting there with the credits rolling, all I could do was sit there. It gave me the most indescribable feeling knowing that I finished it and the game was over (except for the new game+, that is). Tell your friends to buy it, tell your family, tell your dog because this is the greatest game I've finished in a while. It doesn't even cost that much, $15 normally, though I got it for $4 (I think? Somewhere around there) during the Steam summer sale. If you're thinking about getting this game, please do. You won't regret it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A landmark in innovative interactive storytelling and art. perfectly crafted, from the sound and the effects and quality (the muffled sound when shot or pause), the paintings and graphics (which are artworks by themselves), the music, the interactive narrator that enthralls you and describes quite fluidly and naturally your movements and decitions besides intriguing you to keep finding what he wants to say, the variety of choice in the game and the poetic aspect of its story. its all beautiful, trully an artistic masterpiece.it doesnt necesarilly have heavy gameplay features (although i found them quite entertaining and vast myself) but the main catch of the game is the narrative process, the exploration and feel of the environment and simply experiencing the game and what it is saying.

Although I feel the controls/combat system leave a lot to be wanted, I feel as though the game is more about storytelling that it necessarily is about fighting.I'm overall highly impressed with the game, and would recommend it to anyone - if not for the gameplay, the music can just as easily immerse you in this environment.

												An isometric quasi-rpg with satisfyingly repetitive combat, and an impressive new game plus. Still, Bastion is more than that. Bastion is all about its narrative, through music and spoken word, the true soul of this game lies in its somber self-awareness as it cooly reveals itself to you by way of storytelling. Great port, great on KBM or gamepads, and won't break your wallet. Buy this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Proper review supposed to start at the beginning... Ain't so simple with this one	Get Bastion. Really. A discount means it's a steal for youI'm just foolingBastion is an adventure beat-em-up game with unique artstyle, superb storytelling, hypnotizing music, and a meta-ish thingy in the plotline.Bastion graphical representation used a lot of handpainted scenery, resulting in a beautiful and easy-in-the-eye kind of graphics, you won't find many game that uses this kind (well, aside from other game from Supergiant, Transistor). It'll be a different 'graphics' experience for you with BastionThe story in this game are told with a narrator as the player progresses through the Bastion world. The character player control is silent (and looks like the main character communicate with other using handwriting, as hinted by all the dialogue choices when interacting with others), and all element about Bastion are told by the narrator. The narrator did a really excellent job at delivering the world of Bastion to the player. His voice feels friendly, like someone you've known for so long, yet only meet again after a long separation. You won't feel tired listening to the narrator thoughout the game, and it is also a good thing because the way of the storytelling is unique, leaving you with a feeling of wanting to be told more.Music at the bastion is a little different with other games that usually use orchestra of violin, drum, piano or everything else. It sound like 1 or 2 instrument that playing along with a storyteller, and perfectly captures the predicament of the story being told. This fits a lot with the storytelling style of Bastion.Not much of gameplay selling point can be told here. Some people might feels the combat is repetitive, and old as there's no differentiation to other game with same type of combat. That might be true, but I find Bastion combat is at good value. The many Arsenal you'll find coupled with passive boost from Distillery and difficulty tweaker from the Shrine will kinda force you to seek new way to combat the enemy and it's good enough for me.The meta things of Bastion plot is *SPOILER AHEAD  you're supposed to choose a peculiar ending in order for your first playthrough to match with the new game +, the Restoration Protocol. Because the narrator will have some kind of deja vu telling throughout the whole new game + narration, it fits the ending. Also it can be interpreted that as the player, you are the Kid's will that never forget even after time reset itself, the Kid at first want to restore the world before the Calamity happen, but as the player see that restoring the world doesn't prevent the Calamity, on the second playthrough, you know that the correct choice is Evacuation Protocol, thus setting sail for a new home is kinda the right /good ending of Bastion. Bastion is game where a second playthrough is needed to close a loophole that might be caused by 1 ending. And it's spectacular for a game this small to have this kind of meta story.The whole narration or the story is actually Ruck telling the story to Zia about how they all come together, while waiting for the Kid to return from the Tazal Terminal at the last level, so you are playing a memory of Ruck, and the only real time moment Ruck's narrating is when we save/leave Zulf and afterward.Also, dramatic moment when you decide to rescue Zulf. The music is plain tearjerker, the tension of the situation feels heroic and out of respect, you'll struck in awe playing that part.It's finished... No matter what you decide to buy Bastion or not, you done good...The Bastion's gonna take us to a better gametimeSo long kid, Maybe I'll see you in the next one*cue Setting Sail, Coming Home music (youtube it!)

												So, there are loads of reviews that go into great depth as to what makes this game a great buy. I shall focus solely on one aspect that I think needs highlighting.When you pick up a health potion whilst already containing the maximum amount of potions allowed, it's not wasted and fills your health.You wouldn't think this is a big deal, but so often you have to pause, load your health potion, use it, unequip it, acquire new potion. Rinse. Repeat. This game does away with that and it's awesome!			",47,10,0,6,1,0,9

Yes it may be beatable in one day, but the quality more than justifies the quantity. You owe it to yourself to play this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The combat is fast-paced, intense, and fun.The story is alright.The atmosphere was perfect.The ending was amazing.The art looks beautiful and interestingThe soundtrack is prety funky. In a good way.All the unlockable weapons are usable. The one weapon I never used and blatantly did not like was apparently a crowd favorite, which really speaks to the usability of all the weapons. honestly, it's one of my favorite games. It delivers on everything you'd want it to.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So, there are loads of reviews that go into great depth as to what makes this game a great buy. I shall focus solely on one aspect that I think needs highlighting.When you pick up a health potion whilst already containing the maximum amount of potions allowed, it's not wasted and fills your health.You wouldn't think this is a big deal, but so often you have to pause, load your health potion, use it, unequip it, acquire new potion. Rinse. Repeat. This game does away with that and it's awesome!			",47,10,0,6,1,0,9

												This review is brought to you by the wonderful Ponxha.Bastion is indeed one of the most captivating games I've played, gameplay-wise and story-wise.The art, the soundtrack, the narration. All of those elements made this game.GameplayBastion has lots of play styles to experiment with. The variety of melee weapons and ranged weapons gives you lots of different combinations to eliminate your foes. Speaking of enemies, each enemy has different ways to eliminate them and as you progress, you'll need the right tricks to cleverly eliminate your foes with the weapons you choose.StoryI'm not gonna spoil the plot for you, but I can tell you it is one the most heart-warming and clever video game story I've ever experienced. And Logan Cunningham delivers a very fine narration to top it offSoundtrackThe music in this game really immerses you into the theme of the game. Some parts of the story has successfuly shed a tear because of the beautiful music.Verdict+ Extreme variety of weapon play styles+ Beautiful and captivating art+ Surreal music+ Clever and well thought story10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The first thing that has to be said about this game that has been said a million times before is. D'AWWW that little squirt is so cute :3oh and of course the narrator.now this game when i first played it gave me a unique experience i had never encountered with anygame before. before playing bastion i wasnt that huge a fan of these types of game as i tend to have a lot of depth perception problems with isometric games, but the sheer amazment i felt from the narrator made me want to continue with the game, i became so involed with the story i felt a genuine WANT with carrying on and wanting to find out what happens next, what is going to happen to Zulf WHATS GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE Squirt! and somewhere along the way i fell in love with the games mechanics and how it played and how it felt.Now this is somthing i think more games should do, if theres a game that people dont know if everyone is going to enjoy the gameplay at first. create a facinating story and get an amazing narrator to narrate, chances are people will get so absorbed in to the story that they wont notice about the gameplay and get used it with out noticingI havent played a game in a long long time that made me feel the way bastion made me feel, and havent felt again since.Reveiw word of the day : WANT			",318,113,4,55,22,6,25

												A beautiful arcade game with hand painted graphics supported by an interesting and original story and an even more original storytelling. The world you are evoling in is building itself while you are moving, and nearly every of your step is accompagnied by a deep and grizzly narator voice.The game comes with a variety of enemies using different tactics to bother you and of course with bosses. You on the other hand have a big choice of weapons and perks allowing you to always be best prepared for the next world you enter. Weapons are upgradable with ""fragments' of the world you collect during your adventures, and you can also gain fragments while completing challenges related to your weapons or to the story.Expect 20 hours of gaming at least on your first run, and 10 to 15 more if you want to complete the ""New Game Plus"" mode and/or all Steam achievements.I highgly recommend it for anyone wanting to play a ""different"" arcade game.One last thing: there is no way you could not enjoy the beautifully crafted soundtrack.

												A landmark in innovative interactive storytelling and art. perfectly crafted, from the sound and the effects and quality (the muffled sound when shot or pause), the paintings and graphics (which are artworks by themselves), the music, the interactive narrator that enthralls you and describes quite fluidly and naturally your movements and decitions besides intriguing you to keep finding what he wants to say, the variety of choice in the game and the poetic aspect of its story. its all beautiful, trully an artistic masterpiece.it doesnt necesarilly have heavy gameplay features (although i found them quite entertaining and vast myself) but the main catch of the game is the narrative process, the exploration and feel of the environment and simply experiencing the game and what it is saying.

												Oh man, where do I start? I absolutely LOVE this game. It is one of my favorite indie games that I've ever played (though I do still have a lot left to get around to!).The story of Bastion is definitely an interesting one, and the way you learn more of the details is relatively simple but intriguing. For instance, learning through the Dream levels turns out to be more fun than you would expect. The perspective of the characters shifts as the game goes on and it definitely has you wonder what is going on.I liked the frame of everything with the narration, but I don't want to spoil any of the story so I won't say any more. The graphics of the game are great; it is straight up beautiful to look at. Very nice sound all around, and I love the music it has. The actual vocal songs they created were amazing as well and fit the style of their scenes almost perfectly.Gameplay-wise, Bastion still continues pulling things off. There are enough unique enemies and bosses in the game to keep things interesting, and the weapons available also allow for you to test out different builds. The development of the Bastion is nice, even if you end up building everything in one playthrough (meaning you can't necessarily make a ""bad"" choice of what to build). But it helps tie everything into the world as a whole. Each level has a unique feeling to it and definitely keeps me focused. The training grounds for the weapons give you some nice challenges to overcome, and all of them are certainly doable. The potions you can equip further your build for Kid.All in all, Bastion is just an amazing game. It keeps you focused and interested, with next to nothing wrong with the game at all. I never got bored with it, and I never will. I have played it multiple times since it was released, and I am always excited to play it every time I return.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A Modern ClassicIf there was Five Indie games that everyone should play, bastion would be among those games. The game offers are kickass soundtrack among lots of replayability, with great combat system and variety of different weapons (that you can upgrade and customize) there is plenty to do, whatever its unlocking everything or setting higher records on weapon challenges. Narrator is also pretty badassPositives Strong Rock/Western Soundtrack that brings unique feel to the game Epic Narrator  Lot of replay value Multiple Weapon choices to fit different playstyles Smooth controls and gameplay, it feels very responsive and no complaints thereNegatives Bit lackluster story I wish the maingame was bit longer ",425,179,5,53,33,3,42

												Bastion is an amazing game, with amazing gameplay, a great narrator, beautiful visuals, and a soundtrack so good your ears will ♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's upgrade system is good, it has very fun weapons, and overall the gameplay just feels like it's exactly how it should be. The story is very good. It is simple but creative. How is the story told? Well, as you're playing the game, it is narrated from a future point of view. This not only answers questions you have while playing the game, but it leaves you unanswered with the biggest question; To whom is the story being told? Anyways, what is the story about? You wake up, with the world around you shattered and abandoned. As you move on, it soon just seems like you're trying to just fix everything after an apocalypse. Though while you dig deeper into the game, you find out what it's really about. It's about war, and the affect it has on not just people, but on the world. The game lets you make some huge decisions, big enough to make you think ""Am I doing the right thing?"". It's so well put together it made me question who I was and if I knew enough to make decisions that big in real life.The game is one of the most original titles I have ever seen.

From the beginning the player is immersed into the beautiful world and introduced to the phenominal story, with great gameplay that allows for customization of playstyle, together with the greatest musical score the video game industry has ever known, I have never enjoyed an experience with a video game as much as this one, nor has another video game ever changed my outlook on life and given me a once-in-a-lifetime experience like this one did.

												There's not much to say about Bastion...Amazing art direction, slick presentation, superb narration, and the soundtrack blends in perfectly with the gameplay. The game mechanics are excellent as well. Every weapons have a unique feeling to them and are fun to use, from light and heavy melee weapons, to bows and guns. Furthermore, weapons' abilities can be customized through a kind of crafting system which allows for different kind of play style with the same weapon. You can also increase the difficulty at any time by selecting up to 10 idols which grant unique boosts to your enemies, but earn you more experience points in return.Overall, the game's quite short and not very challenging, but that is only because they chose quality over quantity. A highly recommended game and experience.			",951,375,26,138,93,10,183

												Bastion is a 3D platforming game made by a small team of indie developers that stands above a lot of their competitors because of their style of narration, art style, and smooth mechanical brilliance.Bastion blends a very well told story with a very smooth narrative done in a almost storybook like fashion with a great voice actor that rivals the likes of Morgan Freeman, which also helps that none feels out of place or overdone. The platforming is very seamless and does a great job of incorporating a variety of unique weapons that you can choose to fit your play-style. Bastion does a great job of also helping you along the path to mastering said weapon with optional challenges that push your weapon potential to the limit. Above all, the game has an incredible original soundtrack that makes the whole experience that much more enjoyable.Pros:+ Great Narration and storytelling+ Phenominal music, I still sometimes hum the Build the Wall song+ Fast pace platform action game with variety of unique weapons to fit each players play style+ Great hand drawn art+ Fun gameplay+ Great use of different ways to change game difficulty and challenges to unlock upgradesCons:- Not much in replayabilityTL;DR:9/10Very enjoyable 3D platformer with great music, awesome mechanics, and good story.

												Why I play games is both for the challenge of the gameplay and the immersion of the story itself. On both counts Bastion is superb. The story itself can be hard to grasp while you're too busy learning the ropes and not trying to die, but this only serves to make replaying it all the more rewarding. You're in a post-apocalyptic world, and all you have is the voice of a Stranger guiding your steps, to build a Bastion where all can be safe, all can be rebuilt, though your enemies won't see it that way.

												Seriously one of the best games I've ever played. The narration was absolutely amazing, and the soundtrack was stunning. I just finished up the main story line in roughly 5 hours, but will be going back to play ""New Game Plus"" mode very soon. Great story, great audio, amazing game. Highly recommend, one of the best I've played in a long time.			",96,30,6,12,12,3,21

Bastion is a hack n' slash role playing game, however this game has some really interesting aspects that contrast from other games inside the same genre.You play as ""The Kid"" someone that just woke up in the middle of a catastrophe that neither the player nor the character know anything about, however we can count on the strong presence of the Narrator to enlighten us during our adventure.I want my first point on this review to be exactly about the Narrator, something that really standed out from any game I've ever played. We are used to games which story develops over time with strong interactions between characters, or with the environment however in Bastion, every interaction is very  subtle, and that's where the Narrator comes in, as someone telling and unfolding a story and interacting as much with the main character as with the player himself which is awesome. And the developers really hit gold here, since first of all the voice fits perfectly on the western theme that surrounds the game, and at the same time the voice acting is also amazing, since you can feel every emotion which helps create a certain empathy with this being, and that's something fundamental in this story.Since we're talking about voices and sounds let's jump to the soundtrack, which after the Narrator is the best aspect of the game, since it manages to develop and transform according to the story which is phenomenal. You'll understand what i mean since it's quite rare to hear a soundtrack which contain tracks with lyrics, and even though I think that including something like that is risky since it could break the atmosphere of the game, it does exactly the opposite and traps you even more on this brilliant story.Now onto the gameplay, this is up to you to decide if it is a good thing or not according to your standards but to me it felt like the combat and exploration is something secondary. Don't get me wrong, the combat is fun and this aspect of the game is very well developed with a big array of weaponry, abilities and upgrades. The developers even managed to make this part of the game more interesting with the fact that all the way to the last part of the game you unlock a new mechanic, however it didn't feel as good as the plot, which was what really kept me going.The visuals are very interesting, the 2D visuals with the isometric camera really fitted into the style, nevertheless some models seemed quite odd, as an example the main character which on some drawings shows up as someone quite slim, when you look at the model you see someone quite bulky which doesn't make much sense. Same goes for Rucks which the model doesn't look that good either.Something that also bugged me was the fact that you're being told a story and all of a sudden the game gives you the option to make a couple decisions on the final stage and to me it felt out of place, I think you should be either given more choices to make or none at all. Although i think I'll play this game again someday I can't justify playing the main storyline for 5 hours again just to make a diferent decision at the end and see an alternate ending, but if I had more choices throughout the game I could justify a second playthrough immediately after the first one.Nonetheless I consider this game to be a master piece, the story is interesting, the length feels just right and the western/badass vibe throughout the game is an amazing experience.+ Great story;+ Fun mechanics;+ Amazing Atmosphere;- Some models are just ugly;- Lack of more decisions.92% cool game!Join my Steam Group page for more reviews: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/jereviews ",339,94,11,37,42,4,52

												Got this as a gift from a friend (Thanks Sam). If I looked at it beforeand, I probably wouldn't of bought it. It just didn't look like my kind of game.But turns out, it was a lot of fun. I mean you've got your different weapons and places and the narrator sounds cool. I mean, I'm happy I got this for free, but i'd definitely buy it if it's on sale. I think $15 is a little too much for it, but overall it's a solid game. Runs smooth, looks pretty.TL;DR - It may not look like your typical kind of game, but buy it anyways. You'll be surprised.

												This review is brought to you by the wonderful Ponxha.Bastion is indeed one of the most captivating games I've played, gameplay-wise and story-wise.The art, the soundtrack, the narration. All of those elements made this game.GameplayBastion has lots of play styles to experiment with. The variety of melee weapons and ranged weapons gives you lots of different combinations to eliminate your foes. Speaking of enemies, each enemy has different ways to eliminate them and as you progress, you'll need the right tricks to cleverly eliminate your foes with the weapons you choose.StoryI'm not gonna spoil the plot for you, but I can tell you it is one the most heart-warming and clever video game story I've ever experienced. And Logan Cunningham delivers a very fine narration to top it offSoundtrackThe music in this game really immerses you into the theme of the game. Some parts of the story has successfuly shed a tear because of the beautiful music.Verdict+ Extreme variety of weapon play styles+ Beautiful and captivating art+ Surreal music+ Clever and well thought story10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the indie classics. Shame NOT to play it. It's got great gameplay AND great writing, particularly considering how cool the constant narration of your actions is.If I had any complaint, it would be that Xbox 360 gamepad controls pretty much don't work for me, and the game seems to kind of be made for this style of controls. Keyboard+mouse is fine for gameplay but menus can be a little hard to navigate sometimes.Oh well. It's still an excellent game. Took me a little over 10 hours to do pretty much everything there was in one playthrough, by the way, so if you blitzed through it, the game would probably be like half of that, or even less. But there's New Game Plus (which unlocks some new stuff) and another special mode, not to mention many different challenges and ""quests"" to complete, so there's plenty to do. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Game is great! There is such detail to the artwork, the performance of the game is flawless, the narration is wicked good and it takes a very different outlook on a game. Instead of providing us cutscenes and the same old derivitive formats, they give us a game thats the exact opposite of most.

												Bastion is a 3D platforming game made by a small team of indie developers that stands above a lot of their competitors because of their style of narration, art style, and smooth mechanical brilliance.Bastion blends a very well told story with a very smooth narrative done in a almost storybook like fashion with a great voice actor that rivals the likes of Morgan Freeman, which also helps that none feels out of place or overdone. The platforming is very seamless and does a great job of incorporating a variety of unique weapons that you can choose to fit your play-style. Bastion does a great job of also helping you along the path to mastering said weapon with optional challenges that push your weapon potential to the limit. Above all, the game has an incredible original soundtrack that makes the whole experience that much more enjoyable.Pros:+ Great Narration and storytelling+ Phenominal music, I still sometimes hum the Build the Wall song+ Fast pace platform action game with variety of unique weapons to fit each players play style+ Great hand drawn art+ Fun gameplay+ Great use of different ways to change game difficulty and challenges to unlock upgradesCons:- Not much in replayabilityTL;DR:9/10Very enjoyable 3D platformer with great music, awesome mechanics, and good story.

												Why I play games is both for the challenge of the gameplay and the immersion of the story itself. On both counts Bastion is superb. The story itself can be hard to grasp while you're too busy learning the ropes and not trying to die, but this only serves to make replaying it all the more rewarding. You're in a post-apocalyptic world, and all you have is the voice of a Stranger guiding your steps, to build a Bastion where all can be safe, all can be rebuilt, though your enemies won't see it that way. If you take advantage of all the game has to offer, you'll find that your skills have been challenged to the utmost and you are the better for it; and tears may come to your eyes when you make your final choice.

												If you like adventure games, you must give Bastion a try.The art, aesthetics, music, lore, and especially the great narration all combine to provide you with a refreshing adventure experience. The levels are very detailed, and the routes you can take are assembled in front of you as you walk (you can easily fall off the map, which will result in some health loss). There are many destructable objects in the game - this is indicated by the object flashing red whenever you hit it (most objects can be destroyed).As you play, a narrator comments on certain things you do. For example, you may come across a mechanical bull and, if you decide to attack it, the narrator will say something like: ""the kid (you) gave him exactly what he deserved."" The music also changes appropriately when you are in the heat of battle.The controls are very easy to use, however, the feedback prompts can get annoying (for example, when you are at less-than-half health, the keyboard key ""F"" will appear next to your character, along with ""heal."" These button reminders can be helpful, as the game will prompt you to block if you are taking constant damage, however, it can become repetitive if you arleady have mastered the controls.There are many weapons to unlock, and you can equip two at a time; you can also use your shield by pressing/holding shift. Blocking right before the moment an enemy's attack hits you will result in an autoattack. You reflect enemy projectiles if you block with the correct timing. There are a variety of special ""secret moves"" available, and you can equip one - you have to have the specific weapon the skill is bound to equipped. Later, you will also be able to select things like drink passives (provide bonuses like extra health) or ""god"" artifacts that make enemies stronger, but also provide you with a bonus to experience. Everything is upgraded with experience that comes in the form of little blue collectibles. You can select between uo yo 6 different upgrades for each weapon ( 3 active at a time).The game consists of you collecting cores/shards in each level in order to bring the ""Bastion"" base to life - each core you collect usually opens a new building slot in the Bastion, allowing you to select which building type you would like to build first (ex: armory for equipping weapons and skills, or distillery for equipping passive drinks). There are a variety of buildings, each unlocked for building as you progress through the story.There are also weapon challenge levels, where you have to perform a task like destroying a number of items with the hammer within a time frame. Each challenge level has 3 difficulty tiers, and beating the time for that tier yields a prize (1st place is always a secret move). The learning curve is very good, however, the game can get difficult if you use a lot of god trinkets (to increase enemey characteristics) - I equipped a total of 4 and would die from most enemies within 4-5 hits.The game is very charming and I strongly recommend it if you like adventure games with very nice aesthetics and narration.

												Bastion is, hands down, one of the best games I have ever had the fortune of playing. The visuals are incredibly appealing vibrant, fitting colours, detailed artwork. The western-theme nicely by the western music, which is very fitting on the game as a whole. The narrator's voice-overs and explanations for things are flawless and quirky, and make you want to hear more. The gameplay is great fun the combat, starting simple, becomes increasingly fast-paced and skill-based, especially when all idols are enabled for full difficulty. As you progress through the mysterious-yet-lore-heavy storyline, more weapons are unlocked, allowing you to play using different styles. You can eventually customize a ""build"" (a weapon loadout and some bonuses, called spirits). And the gameplay doesn't get old. Many games turn into grinding for levels, but Bastion encourages to play just to play. I am playing through the main storyline for the third time now, having already beaten it once in its regular story and difficulty, and another time in New Game with all idols activated. Replay-ability is very high, and I still have not grown bored of it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bastion is an amazing game, filled with colorful art and a sexy narration that tells the story as you play as oppose to ripping the camera and controls from you so you can watch a 5 minute cut scene. I would love to play another game with this guy as a lead voice. Music for the game is also very good and fitting for this kind of game, somewhat somber at times.The game play is pretty fast pace and excellent, though has it's short falls. One of them is that you are given too many weapons, Unless you plan on experimenting with the weapon load-out, You will usually stick with what works for you. Same with secret skills, which I hardly ever used while playing. Overall, an amazing game that opens up for you the more you play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I just finished Bastion and really enjoyed it. Highly recommended!Gameplay: 8/10 -- Pretty standard stuff, i.e. everything you need from an isometric top-view style action-RPG. Not too complicated, not too simple.Visuals: 9/10 -- Really beautiful hand-drawn world, with a genuine ""feeling"" to it. Animation and cutscenes were also cool. I like how the world ""came together"" as you walked.Audio: 11/10 -- The music is fantastic and the ""Narrator"", accompanying you throught *all* the game, is just awesome. Easily the strongest aspect of the game.Story: 7/10 -- The story is OK, but there's too few characters (err, 4 of them!) and only a couple are really ""explored"". The world the game unveils is interesting, albeit tuned for ""all ages"" audiences.It took me about 12 hours to finish the game; the difficulty was quite OK, maybe a bit easy. I completed almost everything in the standard story-mode, and I didn't do any of ""Game Plus"", for the time being.Achievements (both in-game and steam ones) were quite finely tuned to my liking, keeping me reasonably motivated to play and earn more as I went.My sole problems were: (1) my no-name PS3-like USB gamepad wasn't recognised; typical... (2) Isometric top-view has the NE-SW and NW-SE as the two principal axes, so playing with WASD keys [N-S and W-E axes] was a little weird at first; but I quickly adapted.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best Indie games I've ever played. That is the best example for can be done without being an AAA title.First, the story. The voice of the narrator was the first thing that baffled me. He describes everything (so no character voice), but it's in a unique, very fascinating way.The combat is balanced and well designed. There is no A click, there is more to discover and ""learn"". If you hit an enemy you really can ""feel"" it.The graphics are simple but awesome. The are is painted and differs from any other game I've played. There is no 3D super-hyper-cool-AAA-Shader-Textures-Bling-Bling (thank god). Even the graphics were well-thought-out and matches perfectly.The soundtrack was so good, that i just had to buy the soundtrack.With pure conscience I do recommend this game, if you like RPG style games of course :-)			",99,13,5,6,5,0,7

												Bastion is, hands down, one of the best games I have ever had the fortune of playing. The visuals are incredibly appealing vibrant, fitting colours, detailed artwork. The western-theme nicely by the western music, which is very fitting on the game as a whole. The narrator's voice-overs and explanations for things are flawless and quirky, and make you want to hear more. The gameplay is great fun the combat, starting simple, becomes increasingly fast-paced and skill-based, especially when all idols are enabled for full difficulty. As you progress through the mysterious-yet-lore-heavy storyline, more weapons are unlocked, allowing you to play using different styles. You can eventually customize a ""build"" (a weapon loadout and some bonuses, called spirits). And the gameplay doesn't get old. Many games turn into grinding for levels, but Bastion encourages to play just to play. I am playing through the main storyline for the third time now, having already beaten it once in its regular story and difficulty, and another time in New Game with all idols activated. Replay-ability is very high, and I still have not grown bored of it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you like adventure games, you must give Bastion a try.The art, aesthetics, music, lore, and especially the great narration all combine to provide you with a refreshing adventure experience. The levels are very detailed, and the routes you can take are assembled in front of you as you walk (you can easily fall off the map, which will result in some health loss). There are many destructable objects in the game - this is indicated by the object flashing red whenever you hit it (most objects can be destroyed).As you play, a narrator comments on certain things you do. For example, you may come across a mechanical bull and, if you decide to attack it, the narrator will say something like: ""the kid (you) gave him exactly what he deserved."" The music also changes appropriately when you are in the heat of battle.The controls are very easy to use, however, the feedback prompts can get annoying (for example, when you are at less-than-half health, the keyboard key ""F"" will appear next to your character, along with ""heal."" These button reminders can be helpful, as the game will prompt you to block if you are taking constant damage, however, it can become repetitive if you arleady have mastered the controls.There are many weapons to unlock, and you can equip two at a time; you can also use your shield by pressing/holding shift. Blocking right before the moment an enemy's attack hits you will result in an autoattack. You reflect enemy projectiles if you block with the correct timing. There are a variety of special ""secret moves"" available, and you can equip one - you have to have the specific weapon the skill is bound to equipped. Later, you will also be able to select things like drink passives (provide bonuses like extra health) or ""god"" artifacts that make enemies stronger, but also provide you with a bonus to experience. Everything is upgraded with experience that comes in the form of little blue collectibles. You can select between uo yo 6 different upgrades for each weapon ( 3 active at a time).The game consists of you collecting cores/shards in each level in order to bring the ""Bastion"" base to life - each core you collect usually opens a new building slot in the Bastion, allowing you to select which building type you would like to build first (ex: armory for equipping weapons and skills, or distillery for equipping passive drinks). There are a variety of buildings, each unlocked for building as you progress through the story.There are also weapon challenge levels, where you have to perform a task like destroying a number of items with the hammer within a time frame. Each challenge level has 3 difficulty tiers, and beating the time for that tier yields a prize (1st place is always a secret move). The learning curve is very good, however, the game can get difficult if you use a lot of god trinkets (to increase enemey characteristics) - I equipped a total of 4 and would die from most enemies within 4-5 hits.The game is very charming and I strongly recommend it if you like adventure games with very nice aesthetics and narration.

												what a game! i hate to rave about the soundtrack, since so many often do, but it really is something special. one of the first game soundtracks i've ever purchased, and felt good about purchasing. the gameplay catches a lot of crap, and i can see why, but i think that if you experiment with your loadout enough, the game stays fresh. a lot of people just stick with the hammer/repeater, which is good, but can get really boring really fast. only two characters have any real voice work, and it's done absolutely beautifully. the characters and their stories are compelling, and you'll do the same god damn level over and over to learn more about them. the story started off confusing and difficult to get into, but the more you learn, the more interested you become. highly recommend even at full price. get the soundtrack, too.

Music for the game is also very good and fitting for this kind of game, somewhat somber at times.The game play is pretty fast pace and excellent, though has it's short falls. One of them is that you are given too many weapons, Unless you plan on experimenting with the weapon load-out, You will usually stick with what works for you.

The art is gorgeous, the music stays in your head for hours after playing, and the game play is varied and excellent.

												Bastion is one of the best new games I've played in a long while. I guess technically it is an action-RPG, but not in the traditional sense (for example, it's very short and you only gain 10 levels maximum). But it's not even really the gameplay that is the main attraction anyways (at least not for me) - rather, it's the unique world you get to visit during those few hours. The world is visually beautiful and the soundtrack is amazing, but the main draw that keeps you engaged is the smooth-voiced narrator that tells the story of everything you do as you do it. It's hard to explain the concept properly since it is unprecedented in gaming, so all I can really say is check it out and see for yourself. The game itself is not very hard, so pretty much anyone should be able to finish it (there are also various options more experienced players can enable if they wish to make the game harder). I can't say enough good things about Bastion - it is practically a clinic in game design. Get it!			",828,379,20,113,78,6,151

												Bastion is an amazing game, with entertaining gameplay, a unique and beautiful artstyle, and most importantly an intricate, thorough, and moving story. The gameplay and combat is fairly straightforward, but the combinations of two weapons and a single skill can allow for many styles of play, and the lack of straight upgrades adds to this dynamic as well. Additionally, the system of leveling up was unique and further added to the styles of play, and the difficulty of the game scales well, with additional options to offer a greater challenge. Regardless of the engaging gameplay, Bastion excelled in its storytelling. Told through amazing narration, you experience the story of the world of the Bastion. The environment is defined by the artstyle and the soundtrack (which is definitely worth a listen). What stood out most to me concerning the story, however, was its ability to invoke an emotional response from me. As someone who usually plays games for just their gameplay, the whole story (and particularly the conclusion) I was surprised at how much I actually cared about the kid and the characters he meets. Overall, Bastion is definitely worth a purchase. Decent gameplay in an amazing environment with an engaging story made for a great game.			",74,4,0,9,4,1,7

												It would be remiss of me to begin this review without divulging that if the devs ever resolve to produce a Bastion: Revisited or likewise, I would jump for joy in my pajamas (and probably even pee a little) before insta-buying the game. My love for the game isn't even as strong as my love for procrastination, but it helped me reminisce about an older strategy game I played with similar mechanics.The plot itself is light and uncomplicated - with two choices towards the end. You play as a squat yet resilient Kid, who can wield weapons taller than himself, and dodge attacks with the agility of a jaguar. Tasked with restoring a brittle, post-apocalyptic world, you help him traverse various picturesque floating isles in search of resources while trying not to fall off ledges at every corner. Only a cockroach would survive a fall like that, not your protagonist.Pros : UI - Being able to move around via mouse while battling via keyboard was more satisfying for my hardwired brain than I can account for. You can also choose between complete keyboard control and gamepad. Besides that, the in-game screen itself isn't cluttered with unnecessary icons, which makes for cleaner gameplay.  Weapons - The assortment of murder tools at your disposal will be enough to make you squee. Moreover, they're colorful and have cool names. My personal favorites were the Spear, the Musket and (later on) the Galleon Mortar. The latter is akin to a pocket cannon, but looks and feels much cooler. The weapon upgrade system is unique too. Every time you unlock an upgrade, you can choose between two characteristics. For example, one upgrade for the Army Cabine (a long range, destructive rifle) offers a choice between activating either Faster Aim Speed or Bonus Damage.  Music - I often say this for other games, but it can be quite a challenge to create a good ambience with music. I wouldn't want hardcore metal blaring in my ears during a battle lest I get squashed by a giant hammer. Thankfully, the BGMs in this game keep you perfectly at ease, and are well paced . There are moments when you can hear Zia (the game's Nightingale) singing; it's the kind of voice I can fall asleep to. Mobs - Some are stationary and can be killed with ease. Some have armored heads, will collide into you with all their might, can only be poked if you stick a spear into their♥♥♥♥♥ and ARE FROGS. *internal zombielike laugh* Some can only be killed if you poke them in the eye enough times. (i.e.) They're pesky but they won't bore you. Cons : Bonus Stages - Each time you discover a new weapon, you can test it out in it's exclusive battle grounds to challenge yourself. The difficulty lies in the fact that most of the challenges require you to do something humanely impossible. Like aiming and shooting a random popping scarecrow in 2 seconds, or clearing a minefield of pin-spitting cushions in (what was it?) 1 minute? Since these add to the very charismatic Achievement system in game, which in turn provides resources for upgrades, I'd like to actually be able to complete them. Instead of having to hire a robot. Shrine - This may be appealing to masochists, but invoking ten or so idols to immortalize the already pestilent mobs is not something I can enjoy. Moreover, there's 8 steam achievements for accomplishing these. I don't mind the Shrine system itself, but be more realistic please... Duration - The game ended too quick.Scores Art - 10/10Music - 8/10Narration - 11/10Plot - 8/10Overall Score - 7/10 (would've given a 9 if I wasn't such an achievement hoe)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Bastion"" - if it wasn't for my friend, who knows I love good stories and good soundtracks I might have never tried this game. He got me a copy, and I got addicted.In the game, you play as the Kid, who wakes up, and finds his world is literally falling to pieces. The ground shatters beneath him, it's like something is devouring the land like a disease. And that something is called the Calamity. The Kid has to find his way to the Bastion, a place created to gather any survivors in case of a catastrophy. A place that is supposed to save to world. But through his travels the Kid meets other people, finds their stories, and then discovers the horrible truth about the Calamity, and the Bastion itself.It's an action RPG set in a two-dimensional world with an isometric camera. Sounds simple, and boring enough, right? Wrong! The world is beautifully painted, colourful and vivid. There is a vast number of different enemies and environments. You also have a large group of weapons to choose from, and create your own style of fighting. For me, I always prefered the war machete as a melee, scrap musket as ranged, and squirt lure as a special ability. But there is a number of combinations, and everyone will find something fitting. The gameplay is mostly hack&slash, not gonna lie. But the story is just gripping. You do get involved, you do get attached, and at some point, you will be forced to make a decision. And it is not an easy one, it squeezed a tear out of my eye.The soundtrack deserves its own review... From blues bar sounding ""Slinger's song"", through the sweet notes of ""Build that wall"", exciting and fun ""Terminal march"", and the beautiful, heartbreaking ""Mother, I'm here"", this soundtrack provides about an hour of eargasms... I listened to it for two weeks non stop, after I completed the game, it's that good.Oh, and I forgot the best bit. The whole game is narrated by a deep, warm voice. With a hint of sense of humour, a lot of sarcasm, and plenty of emotions, the narrator, also known as Rucks, creates an atmosphere of a campfire story, being told to anyone who dares to listen.Will you dare?

With that said I took this game pretty slowly and I still beat it in 8 hours, Just keep that in mind. Let me just start off by saying this game is a work of Art, A Masterpiece. This game honestly shocked me, Before I knew who supergiant was, I went into this game thinking it was just some average indie game with little story. I thought that  you would just be  going from zone to zone grabbing these crystal shards until you finish the crystal. But slowly you start to realize it is not just that, you start to notice it is more complicated than that and encounter new characters and Items. As you get further and further into the game,the story starts getting thicker and thicker. The narrator (Who is absolutely fantastic by the way) Is pretty much telling someone the story of what you are doing in that moment and this mechanic is what helps guide you through some parts that you may not have figured out.As you progress you get these items which you use at the Bastion to upgrade the weapons which adds some variation is play styles.  My only complaint is that the OPTIONAL dream levels took so long and there was no checkpoints so if you died on the last wave you would have to restart and redo the last 20 minutes over again.9/10, excited to move on and play transistor finally!!

												Bastion was a pleasant surprise.  I got it sometime last year, in an indie bundle, never did anything with it, didn't know anything about it,  just let it sit.  Well today, being super bored that I was, and trying some of these games that I own, but never played, this was an unexpected surprise!  It's a narrative story, that narrates as you are playing, and surprisingly it included actions that I did in the world that I wasn't expecting at all.  So if you are bored, and happen to own this game and haven't tried it, or are looking for something new to pick up, check this one out!			",305,90,16,97,38,9,103

												Bastion is a truly incredible game.  While not a particularly long one, the depth of it lies in its beauty and story.  It stands out because of the artwork and the narration primarily, but many other aspects hold gamers captivated.  The music is wonderful and the various weapons are highly entertaining.  The narration was one of my personal favorite features.  Many games force you to sit through cut scenes or read massive amounts of text.  But the narration allows you to play without disturbances, and as it is sometimes subject to what you do in the game, it adds a level of humor.  It’s a beautiful game that I’ve played through multiple times (different account) and have yet to grow tired of.  The richness of the world created and the storyline lurking around every corner brings out the unique magic that Bastion holds.			",64,10,0,4,1,0,0

												One of the better soundtracks I've heard in a very long time, along with the Uncharted Series, Ori and the Blind Forest, and Skyrim. Combat is fluid, the levels are well designed, and let us not forget that guy narrating your every move. He's awesome.I will also mention that this is one of the more beautiful games I've played in a long time, reminding me a lot of said Ori and the Blind Forest. It's bright, it's dynamic, and the colors always go with the levels flawlessly.And this is all coming from less than an hour of gameplay.I'll probably re-write this review later on, when I have more time in the game, but I have an inkling this will end up being one of the better games I've played in recent days, if not my life.So, far, my first impression is %100 positive. Can't wait to see more of it.			",280,74,8,17,17,3,17

The soundtrack is powerfull and helps building the atmosphere; creating excitement and suspense for its fun, action-packed gameplay - and hits you right in the feels when the story asks for it. Said story is- although not necessarily the focus, as narrative and gameplay happen mostly simultaneously- gripping and delivers its message convincingly.If you haven't bought Bastion yet (which I assume, since you are reading this), you should do so now!

												This game is great. I was immediately surprised by how easy it is to play with multiple combinations of weapons and skills, especially since each weapon is rather well balanced, and it is both possible and feasible to use any combination you can imagine, except perhaps in the case of weapon-specific skills. Also, the dynamic narration and music (also dynamic!) really help with the atmosphere, and the decisions you make actually have consequences. This is a fine example of a game where YOU get to choose how you will play. Will you bring a pair of ranged weapons? Or will you go full melee? Maybe you prefer a ranged weapon and a melee weapon. This game lets you play with any combination! The roll ability especially adds to the gameplay, allowing you to gain distance for a ranged strike, or move in for a quick melee attack. It has been a while since I played a game this dynamic and fluid, and I happily recommend it to anyone reading this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My God, I've just finished this game and I have no words to describe how hilarious it is. Maybe it's just me, and this game suits me well, but I've had one of the most awesome experiences in my gamer-life. Mostly it's thanks to the story - smooth and perfect, it slowly unfolds before your eyes. The ending touches, but I won't be relling a word not to accidentally spoil someone's gaming experience.The second awesome thing is soundtrack. My Goodness, how I loved it! One day I've caught myself humming one of the motives during the working day - and than's when I realized i was in love with it. So grammophone was just another piece of game for me, perfect in itself.The other aspects of this hilarious game were also leaving only positive impressions - battle system, weapons upgrade system, spirits, special ablities, shrines with varying difficultie through the game, pets (omg, Squirt was sooo qute!) and so on. Of course the draphic design - the style is just complementing the whole picture, creating the masterpiece.So, if you ask me, I would completely reccomend this game to everyone who loves game with strong breathtaking stories.

												Surprisingly good and lovely game. It has a nice and intriguing story and cowboy-like songs and narrative that mixes very well with the intended atmosphere. I love the narrator's voiceover, btw. The game itself is easy and fast paced. You have to clear levels and, one after one, the story advances in the ""city"" (Bastion), revealling more details of future and past. You gain abilities and new weapons and customizations each level aswell. You can carry two weapons and one power at the same time, but can shift between all your unlocked weapons anytime at the arsenal buildings.On the last part, you have to make a choice (no spoilers) which leads you to one of the two avaiable endings. I recommend this game for pretty much everyone, specially those looking for a light story with soft gameplay elements and not so time/commitment requiring. I also recommend this game to children of 7+ yo; not because this game is silly or childish, but because there is no gore or explicit violence and kids could find the colorful themes and animations quite entertaining. At last, there's something on the moral of the story that parents could find inspiring and teaching aswell.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I do not typically make it a point to write reviews. However, I would be ashamed of myself for letting the opportunity to share how much I love this game slip by. I have logged far more hours into this game than the counter would suggest, and have loved every single one of them.The story is polished and gripping. It unfolds in pieces, just like the world around you. Nothing is obvious at first glance, and every word spoken unveils new depths of emotion and connection to the characters and events without ever simply ""giving it away.""The narrator, Logan Cunningham, is unreal. His voice feels like sunlight, and the almost interactive way the narration plays into the gameplay leaves you always wanting to find out what else there is to be heard.Darren Korb's OST is one of the best I have ever heard, as many who have played would agree. The fusion of American Western and Middle Eastern sounds, with heavy and dynamic rhythms, is gripping. Not a single note is out of place as you wander, battle, and witness the twisted world around you. The fast songs get you excited and the somber songs shatter your heart.The gameplay is not particularly revolutionary, but it is well tuned and fun. The balance of difficulty and responsiveness allows beginners to enjoy themselves and pros to hone their reaction times and quick-thinking capabilities. The variety of weapons, skills, upgrades, spirits, and idols allows for a customizable experience that leaves you free to fight how you please. Balancing range and close-quarters? Tactical, strategic combat? Raw firepower? All are viable, playable options that leave you feeling pleased as punch.The art...is a blessing to the eyes. Unique, painstakingly handpainted beauty with every step you take. A beautiful fusion of styles create an atmosphere unlike any other, that seemlessly blends all aspects of the game together into a world that captures the imagination.Lastly, the characters and enemies are both enigmatic and relatable. Each character brings something powerful to the table, allowing players to connect on an emotional level - something very difficult for many AAA titles to accomplish. Enemies are well-designed and entertaining, leaving the player feeling ever-so-slightly guilty for their deaths...In short, absolutely the best indie game I have ever played, and one of the greatest that I own. In no aspect does it fail to live up to the standards that every game should aspire to. I hope, for the sake of your own experience and for the sake of the wonderful people who put so much love into making this game, that you wait no longer to buy and experience this masterpiece.

												This game displays a mysterious world full of interesting places. This is a game with 2D graphics and 3D movement, so you ought to get used to pressing two movement keys at once most of the time. The graphics are great, the artwork is detailed and the animations are satisfying. The combat is surprisingly fun and there's an upgrade system for your weapons that's full of possibilities. But the greatest thing about this game is the narrator. You get a badass background voice narrating everything you do. Every achievement, every mistake, and every ridiculous stunt you manage to pull off do not go unnoticed. Overall, this game is amazing and definitely worth its price. If it gets a price drop do not doubt for a second and buy it.			",339,61,7,39,30,2,47

												This is a difficult game for me to recommend. I'd heard wonderful things about it, and when I finally tried it I was immediately pulled in by the narrator's voice. The story is very engaging, the characters are intriguing with interesting backstories and figuring out the (beautiful!) world is a pleasure. All the things that I love in a RPG.But boy, is this game hard. Ignore the ""action"" part of ""action RPG"" at your own peril. Thankfully there's a wimpy mode that lets you come back to life as many times as necessary, but I struggled nearly every step of the way. I could barely comprehend it when I found a building that lets you _increase_ the difficulty in all sorts of insane ways. Learning about a character's background is done by cutting off the story into little pieces intersected by really tough fights.If you love playing games mainly for their story, brace yourself and make sure you understand what you're getting yourself into!

												The game is really awesome. Its simple controls and fast learning curve are appreciated. The graphics are rather beautiful and colorful.What I like about the game really are the levels. They are short, allowing for a lot of variety, which the game does use. City, ports, forests, etc.The weapons are nothing too original, yet each is used in a different way; allowing to fit anyone's playstyle. The upgrade system of the weapons is well balanced, making you wait some time before getting the really useful ones.When it comes to soundtrack, I got to say they are really awesome: joyful, calm, clear; it goes by itself and fits the area you're in.My two complaints about it would be that I found the game lacking some ""real difficulty"". Yes, there are shrines that increases it significantly by adding chances for ennemies to block, to become invincible for some time, etc. I would say, ""real difficulty"" to be ennemies with paterns, ways to behave, effective spots as real difficulty. Here, bosses are similar to their counterparts but with more HP and more damage. The good example of ""real difficulty"" would be The Binding of Isaac.My second complaint is that I find the game a bit too short (finished the story in 5 hours). I would have loved a longer story because I really loved it.Final verdict: the game is not perfect, but is certainly worth your time. 17/20			",30,1,1,2,2,0,1

												Você vê este jogo em promoção, barato, talvez deva comprar. Vê a expressão pensativa do Kid e gosta das letras de ""Bastion"", e o nome também não lhe parece nada mal. Você olha os reviews, a maioria positivos, vê as imagens e pensa ""ahhhhh, é mais um daqueles joguinhos"".Minha situação é a do homem que está diante de uma obra de arte coberta, enquanto todos ao redor dele vêem apenas o pano vazio. Como explicar Bastion? Ele difere de vários outros jogos pelo simples fato de ser inteiramente narrado por um homem, mas não é ""somente um narrador não-personagem"". Ele não só está na história, como faz tudo parecer muito mais profundo sob a voz dele.""Now here's a kid whole whole world got all twisted, leaving him stranding on a rock in the sky.""Ele acorda, descobre-se sozinho numa ilhota de chão, no meio do céu. Como se tivesse dormido e tudo tivesse desaparecido, menos o chãozinho e o colchão. Mas quando ele anda, as pedras surgem e formam um caminho! Bom, você nada pode fazer senão seguir. O garoto encontra seu fiel martelo, e também alguns seres que antes trabalhavam como operário, mas por algum motivo resolvem te atacar.Para onde ele irá? Para o Bastion. Onde todos devem ir em caso de emergência. Mas ao chegar lá, esperando encontrar as pessoas, ele encontra primeiro um homem. ""He finds me"", diz o narrador. E então a verdadeira história começa.Bom, tudo parece estar suspenso no céu, então tem claramente alguma coisa errada. Você precisa então juntar Cores espalhados pelos... bom, pelos lugares restantes de Caelondia, porque os Cores têm poder e os mantém no lugar. Ao mesmo tempo você encontra alguns fragmentos, que, primitivamente falando, seriam como a ""moeda"" do jogo.A jogabilidade é bastante simples. Teclas para se mover, botão esquerdo do mouse pra usar uma arma, botão direito para usar a outra. Barra de espaço para rolar, shift para bloquear, botão do meio do mouse ou Q pra usar habilidade especial. A Calamidade aconteceu, mas você não sabe a causa, e ficará, durante o jogo inteiro, perguntando-se o que é isso. A cada Core reunido, você pode recriar um novo edifício em Bastion. E vamos dizer que reunir os Cores é... Bom, não quero estragar a surpresa.Você tem algumas armas que vai ganhando ao longo do jogo, e pode escolher duas delas pra usar. Cada arma possui cinco upgrades, e cada upgrade possui dois melhoramentos. Você escolhe um melhoramento de cada upgrade, podendo alterar quando desejar. Há poções que conferem efeitos passivos, um Achados-e-Perdidos, um Memorial com missões... E criaturinhas que você encontra, lembrando-se de que nem todos são seus inimigos.É um jogo fácil, pelo menos até você libertar os deuses do Santuário, que conferem mais dificuldade ao mesmo tempo que aumentam o ganho de Experiência. Há também os Proving Grounds, que são desafios específicos para cada arma(e um para o escudo). Alguns chegam a ser moleza, mas a maioria são mesmo desafios, e Bastion é um jogo completo, desafiador, profundo. Há também os ""Who Knows Where"", que são ""desafios"" onde o Kid dorme, e o narrador conta uma parte especial sobre determinada personagem.E no final, tudo terminará com uma grande decisão sua.Feito para ser completado duas vezes. Não digo isso porque ""O jogo é tão bom que te dá vontade de completar de novo"", de jeito nenhum - quando você completá-lo pela primeira vez, entenderá.Usei muitas palavras para meu jogo inde favorito, mas se eu só pudesse usar poucas, elas seriam ""Esse jogo possui uma alma"".

												An isometric action-rpg, Bastion is set in world after the events of the ""Calamity"", where you play as ""The Kid"" and attempt to restore the Bastion.Gameplay consists of using a combination of upgradeable weapons and skills in the form of 'Tonics' that you can buy and find in the wild. Very satisfying combat with customisable difficulty through 'Shrines' that can, for example, give enemies extra health and explode after death. Some of the best level design I have ever experienced in a game, in which the ground forms as you progress through the beautiful and varied levels of swamps, forests and ruined city districts. The sound design is also second to none, featuring briliant voice acting as well as an enchanting and at times, frantic soundtrack that perfectly captures the setting of each individual level. Bastion, can be played with a mouse and keyboard as well as a controller, although I myself preferred using an xbox controller. There is some replayability, in the form of new game plus modes unlocked by completing the main story. I heartily recommend this game to anyone and everyone, and is a personal favourite of mine.

												Bastion is a fantastic and colorful game that tells a heartwarming story. The game revolves around the narrator, a likable figure that dictates your actions and voices the game's story. He is quite unique, and unlike other narrators in games like ""Thomas Was Alone"" or ""The Stanley Parable"". I honestly can't quite explain it, you would have to play the game for yourself to see it. The gameplay is fun -- and even though animation isn't top-notch, you barely notice it. You have the ability to level-up, gaining new weapons and powers -- there's also plenty of secrets about the world to discover. Bastion's combat is fairly enjoyable -- and although challenging, it was not frustrating.Bastion forms around the choices you make. This includes the narration. For instance, during the beginning of the game, (if you destroy enough items) you are told the classic line: ""Kid just rages for a while."" Some of the other choices are more influential, of course. I was proud and happy about some of my choices, but filled with dismay over others. (And such is life.)Overall, this is one of the best indie games of all time. It's worth all $15, but if you wait long enough you can pick it up on sale (or in an indie bundle).Bastion is great for everyone, no matter what you like in a game.			",615,190,20,65,43,5,93

												Bastion is a marvelous little hack and slash title. The gameplay is fun and exciting but the real draw here is the storytelling. The game is told through a gritty voiced narrator who draws you in from the first word. The music in the game is wonderful and is used to support the narritive togreat effect. I highly reccomend Bastion to anyone. Though I do reccomend playing with a controller.			",419,166,4,67,29,4,57

Posted: March 22, 2014
												First off, this game is amazing, and a must buy.Let me tell you why this is so. This game has a very unique artstyle, and not in a bad way. It's probably one of the best looking games I've had the pleasure to play. The art really gives an atmosphere to the game, which is lacking in most games (In my oppinion). Another thing done to almost perfection, is the music. The music in this game blew me away, it's action-packed when needed and it's a bit.. ""toned down"" and emotional, when it's needed. This contributes alot to the atomphere of the game aswell.The main focus of the game, and the thing you'll be doing the most, is using various weapons to kill creatures, critters and other living things. The game ALSO does great in this part. The combat is responsive, and does not feel like a ""mash-to-win"" thing. It also requires an amount of skill to master. This is empathised by the game it self, as it has ""Training Grounds"" where you can unlock 3 tiers of rewards, depending on how good you do a task, where the third tier is perfecting the task (Which is very difficult). This combat system if what I'd call an ""easy to learn, hard to master"" kind of thing. The game has around 10 weapons, where around half of them are ranged and the other half melee. You also get a ""secret skill"" which is like a special move, but you can't use it all the time, it has a resource attached to it which you can hold 3 of. You can upgrade your weapons aswell, It's almost impossible to upgrade them all. That's all I'm going to say on that.Now I think it's time to talk about the story. It's great. I'm not a ""story guy"" as I apreciate good mechanics instead of a great story. But since this has great mechanics, I started to focus on the story aswell. I'm scared to say anything about it, I'd recomend you to go experience it for yourself. The levels them self don't get boring either. They are kind of being built, as you go along the path. That's the way this game does secrets aswell, which there are a few of. This makes the levels feel very dynamic, as they're kind of built on the spot. So now I'm going to repeat my self... Go buy this game. It's worth the price.			",172,29,4,20,25,2,19

												This game is excellent, some people may say it´s pretty short but i think it´s durability is balanced enough for the plot. Talking about the plot, it was so good, a good idea, filled with awesome characters and a lot of changes around the story.The art style is neat, all the platforms appearing out of nowhere are something I liked, but the entire post apocaliptic- half modern half medieval- wild like style really got me into loving the concept.Something that really got me was the sound production,  the narrator´s voice was so intense and so captivating, the same goes for the OST. It is a real master piece.The gameplay had it´s good parts and bad parts, but mostly good ones.It´s worth it´s money.Trully charmed by this game.			",100,13,0,18,5,0,3

This game has an innovative, somewhat interactive, narrator who reminds me of Morgan Freeman, and if that's not enough, the soundtrack is incredible. Really just an amazingly well done game. My only problem with it is that it's not longer. You can beat it with about 10 hours of gameplay if its your first time playing it, 6~ hours on your 2nd playthrough. Took me about 18 hours total to get all the achievements. Still worth every penny though.			",123,15,0,17,6,2,14

												Do I recomend this game? Yes, yes I do.Why?Well, this is a game that gives you great art, a fantasic story and one of the most epic soundtracks ever. The gameplay is fun and even if the characters you meet are rather limited (4) and you dont learn a lot about them from the ""main story quests"" you still get quite atached to them and you have the chance to hear their backstory throughout the gameplay.There are some stuff that might bug certain people, it's not the longest and most difficult game, I cleared the game after about 5 hours but doing the story mode plus and doing all the extra stuff can give you a few more hours of great fun and the game does give you tasks that you can try to achieve. The enemies can feel a bit repetative but this isn't something I really thought much about since I was focusing on the story being told in the background.So in the end, it has it's downsides but to me and most people (as far as I know) the + is worth more than the -			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bastion is an action adventure game with a few RPG elements. The gameplay is dynamic, and very entertaining; art style is cartoonish, colorful, haflfway anime but not overdone. OST is one of the best I've heard and it's perfectly used through the game fitting each moment's pace completely. These things would already make the game outstand, yet it's major strenght is story and narrative. You can easily immerse into the story by hearing the narrator as you advance through the game, story unfolds with each step you take. It has only a few or no drawbacks, the only I can think of is it's relatively short duration (6-7 hrs) and that the ending didn't wrap everything up as I would like.Final veredict: Brillant 9,3/10. Totally recommended.			",141,29,1,7,10,3,12

												Bastion is a Fantastic game and i enjoyed every single second of it! The game has great music and graphics. An interesting narrator that comments on your actions / decisions. And it also has a ""Campaign+"" Mode, Where you play the game over again with all of the stuff you got on your first playthrough. Its however a fairly short game that is not very challenging. However you can up the challenge by adding ""Idols"" Which makes the monsters harder to defeat, such as they attack faster, Take more damage on you, drop grenades once killed, Can't be shot with guns etc. This makes the game much harder.It's a fun little title which you'll beat in a few hours. I've read that some people have played it for more than 60Hours. I myself haven't come back to it yet but now im thinking about playing it once more as it was so fantastic!  The music and narrator of the game makes it a memorable experience that you most likely won't forget too easily :)			",105,12,4,7,11,1,26

												An interesting take on storytelling in video games, the Bastion actually pulls off using a narrator. Add wonderfully colorful, although sometimes a bit mismatched aesthethics, a good soundtrack and, most importantly, solid gameplay and you've got yourself a compelling experience for even the most jaded of players.

												I picked up Bastion when it was on sale because I've heard so many great stories about its beauitful design and magnificent story. Both of those things don't generally appeal to me when searching for a game. I'm not one for graphics or storyline in any respect, but both of those things ended up being the reason I continued Bastion to the end and started it over once more.Its one of those rare games that triple A titles can't compete with.

												Should you play Bastion if you haven't done it yet? In one word : YES. Gameplay-wise the game is very well done. You collect weapons, spirits, level up, upgrade you weapons, etc. The difficulty level is adjustable by use of idols : you practically invoke the gods who in return make your life harder :) . To be honest, i played the game 3 times using the idols just to get more achievements. It's a blast! To make it short, the gameplay is engaging and challenging at times. Now the best part of Bastion : it's music and graphics. About the music there is nothing to say except that it's gorgeous. You'll definetly download the soundtrack and integrate it in your playlist. The narrator does a fantastic job at depicting the story and describing your every action. The narrator is no more that person who talks only between mission. If you break a vase, he tells you that, if you defeat a boss, he's certainly got something up his sleeve to say. And all this happenes without becoming too annoying.The graphics are astounding despite the fact they are 2d (or at least the background is). In fact, this has an even more powerful impact on your perception than a game who has 3d graphics. Every detail in the game is finely drawn and you'll feel the urge to explore every nook and cranny just to see the vistas.So, what are you doing here reading ? Go buy the game!9/10			",63,12,2,18,5,1,26

												i just finished my first playthrough of this game, and I was very impressed. Though I played a demo for this on the Xbox Live Arcade back when it was released, I never got around to owning it until recently. The hand painted art style is both stunning and fresh, as is the unconventional storytelling method. The ability to upgrade all of the various weapons several times, as well as test your skill with them at each respective proving ground, was very rewarding and kept me coming back for more. The pacing of the game, especially the introduction of new enemies was well done, forcing you to change your tactics on the fly. Though it can be rather short depending on your playstyle (It took me around twelve/thirteen hours trying to do everything possible), the inclusion of new game plus, as well as score attack modes provide ample replay value. This is truly a great game worthy of all the praise heaped upon it.			",88,16,1,16,7,1,21

This is the best way of storytelling I have ever experienced.The story is also very neat and often touching. The final choice one has to make was the toughest of my gaming career I think...especially since it doesn't have this right-wrong, good-evil feel to it, but I'm not gonna spoil any more here!I finished the game the first time half an hour ago and I'm still emotionally involved.Now not much more to say, except: Play this game!Together with World of Goo, Limbo and Super Meat Boy this is the most epic piece of Indiegaming!

												Fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. Don't let's it's simplistic graphics fool you, Bastion is an incredible gaming experience with so much to offer, being very unique in a world filled with games that follow the same generic algorithm. It's controls are simple, easy to pick up and use but at the same time taking time and practice to master. What really makes Bastion a must-play is it's incredible voice acting, narration and soundtrack. While the enemies and combat mechanics seem a bit ""Spiral Knight-ish"", it's easy to overlook that when facing the big picture, Bastion has everything that Spiral Knights didn't, breath-taking music, immersive narration by a very talented actor, fantastic art style and storyline to complement it all, wrapping it all with in a neat bow for what could easily be the greatest birds-eye beat 'em up action RPG on the market.Do not miss this game, it is next to perfect!

												Você vê este jogo em promoção, barato, talvez deva comprar. Vê a expressão pensativa do Kid e gosta das letras de ""Bastion"", e o nome também não lhe parece nada mal. Você olha os reviews, a maioria positivos, vê as imagens e pensa ""ahhhhh, é mais um daqueles joguinhos"".Minha situação é a do homem que está diante de uma obra de arte coberta, enquanto todos ao redor dele vêem apenas o pano vazio. Como explicar Bastion? Ele difere de vários outros jogos pelo simples fato de ser inteiramente narrado por um homem, mas não é ""somente um narrador não-personagem"". Ele não só está na história, como faz tudo parecer muito mais profundo sob a voz dele.""Now here's a kid whole whole world got all twisted, leaving him stranding on a rock in the sky.""Ele acorda, descobre-se sozinho numa ilhota de chão, no meio do céu. Como se tivesse dormido e tudo tivesse desaparecido, menos o chãozinho e o colchão. Mas quando ele anda, as pedras surgem e formam um caminho! Bom, você nada pode fazer senão seguir. O garoto encontra seu fiel martelo, e também alguns seres que antes trabalhavam como operário, mas por algum motivo resolvem te atacar.Para onde ele irá? Para o Bastion. Onde todos devem ir em caso de emergência. Mas ao chegar lá, esperando encontrar as pessoas, ele encontra primeiro um homem. ""He finds me"", diz o narrador. E então a verdadeira história começa.Bom, tudo parece estar suspenso no céu, então tem claramente alguma coisa errada. Você precisa então juntar Cores espalhados pelos... bom, pelos lugares restantes de Caelondia, porque os Cores têm poder e os mantém no lugar. Ao mesmo tempo você encontra alguns fragmentos, que, primitivamente falando, seriam como a ""moeda"" do jogo.A jogabilidade é bastante simples. Teclas para se mover, botão esquerdo do mouse pra usar uma arma, botão direito para usar a outra. Barra de espaço para rolar, shift para bloquear, botão do meio do mouse ou Q pra usar habilidade especial. A Calamidade aconteceu, mas você não sabe a causa, e ficará, durante o jogo inteiro, perguntando-se o que é isso. A cada Core reunido, você pode recriar um novo edifício em Bastion. E vamos dizer que reunir os Cores é... Bom, não quero estragar a surpresa.Você tem algumas armas que vai ganhando ao longo do jogo, e pode escolher duas delas pra usar. Cada arma possui cinco upgrades, e cada upgrade possui dois melhoramentos. Você escolhe um melhoramento de cada upgrade, podendo alterar quando desejar. Há poções que conferem efeitos passivos, um Achados-e-Perdidos, um Memorial com missões... E criaturinhas que você encontra, lembrando-se de que nem todos são seus inimigos.É um jogo fácil, pelo menos até você libertar os deuses do Santuário, que conferem mais dificuldade ao mesmo tempo que aumentam o ganho de Experiência. Há também os Proving Grounds, que são desafios específicos para cada arma(e um para o escudo). Alguns chegam a ser moleza, mas a maioria são mesmo desafios, e Bastion é um jogo completo, desafiador, profundo. Há também os ""Who Knows Where"", que são ""desafios"" onde o Kid dorme, e o narrador conta uma parte especial sobre determinada personagem.E no final, tudo terminará com uma grande decisão sua.Feito para ser completado duas vezes. Não digo isso porque ""O jogo é tão bom que te dá vontade de completar de novo"", de jeito nenhum - quando você completá-lo pela primeira vez, entenderá.Usei muitas palavras para meu jogo inde favorito, mas se eu só pudesse usar poucas, elas seriam ""Esse jogo possui uma alma"".

												Bastion is a 2.5d action RPG with probably the greatest voice narration I've ever heard. I still enjoy when the narrator narrates the little things you do like perfect blocks or just smashing the environment, and even when destroying the world you may get a new tidbit about it. Just hearing the feedback on combat and the bits of information about the world without having to thumb through pages of in game text makes the whole thing a smooth experience. It's a game where you're the badass hero with his own narrator, a great soundtrack, and it's really fun to boot.			",525,159,0,78,46,3,76

												What can be said about indie darling Bastion that hasn't been said? It's definitely a great game, and if you haven't played it yet, you should. The gameplay is fun, the art direction is unique, and the narration as you play is pretty interesting. I will say that the story isn't the most coherent, and that the narrator is always talking, so if you don't like his voice then it's gonna get real old real quick. But overall I really enjoyed Bastion!			",74,9,0,9,3,0,3

												I enjoyed this game. It has lovely graphics and catchy music. Narration took some time to get used to, it's a clever touch but I kind of missed a lot of it when focusing more on gameplay than in listening. There is a nice variety of weapons to build a comfortable combination for oneself (fast/powerful, melee/ranged). Story could have been longer, but at least the game didn't become dull grinding.What I most dislike is the platform jumping, it got on my nerves. Otherwise the game wasn't too stressful and I enjoyed that. If I had to give the game a number it would be...8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bastion is one of my favorite games in recent years. It also might be my #1 Indie game. Although there may not be anything completely original in this title, the way the game is presented feels different from the majority of games I've played. They keep a lot of tried and true mechanics (e.g. upgradable weapons and character, multiple levels categorized by zones, home base where you will upgrade and customize your character, and unlockable arena battles to test your skills) but they've added plenty of charm and character to this title that keep it fresh. The narrator is one of the most memorable parts of the game and you will learn most of the world's lore and story progression via his soothing voice. The controls are very tight and almost perfect. The way you can alter your difficulty with the idols you unlock is also a nice feature that forces you to adjust your fighting technique if you want to face these self-imposed challenges. I finished the game several months ago for the 5th time, but keep reminiscing about the music, weapon loadout and the final, tough-as-nails dream challenge.9.5/10			",435,146,11,46,26,5,52

												Can't believe it took me this long to play this indie-gameSupergiant games made Bastion and Transistor, both similiar games from the way they are made.And Bastion is a truly good game, it's been ages since I enjoyed I game from start to finish.Not only are the visuals just bloody beautiful, the music fitting and gorgeos(maybe not as much as Transistor) but they nailed the gameplay.You get a ton of weapons, each with 5 of 10 possible upgrades, passive abillities, XP boost wich make the game way more difficult(for those who are truly good!) and the real time fighting is enjoyable, though I feel like I'd say something like ""you will love the action ect.""Story is just....great. Maybe a little short at some point, but the end choice way kinda tough.Last but not least: the narrator is always there and will make you AT MINIMUM smile every time, if not make you laugh in the heat of the battle or safe zones.Most people say Super Meat Boy, Braid, Binding of Isaac and Shovel Knight are the go to Indie games. I personally didn't enjoy them nearly enough to say that.But BastionBastion actually holds up Go love it ",104,26,0,7,6,0,5

												A perfect game. I didn't think much of this game before playing, but after I did I was amazed. Bastion is basically a top- down action RPG where you (as a boy) have to go around looking for shards to save the world.The music is great and suits the game perfectly. You also have a neat selection of weapons to choose from such as a sword,hammer, musket etc. with unique upgrades to suit your playstyle. There are about 12-13 levels in this game which are all feel different from each other. Voice acting is also good as well. There are different game modes available such as survival and score attack and new game plus which add to some replayability to the game. Finally,the story is remarkable and something you will remeber for a while.A problem I have with the game is the angles of some of the levels. I kept falling off because it was somewhat difficult to walk in a diagonal line in order to stay on some of the platforms. Another problem is that the direction your facing with the shield may not block all attacks as intended.Should you buy it? Well, after playing the game for 16 hours (normal, new game plus  and all survival modes). I still have an urge to go back and play this game all over again.			",420,113,10,57,34,2,84

Also, it includes the vocal performance of the highly underrated Logan Cunningham.

Make enemies take more damage, dish out more, reflect damage, try to blow you up when they die, and a few others.Seriously, i can't put it into words how good this game is. I am unworthy.

												Where to begin? This game is absolutley beautiful, from the soundtrack, to the different regions/""worlds"", the art style, the very vibe it gives off; it is amazing. There is something so mystical and vibrant about the environment that I just can't put my finger on. The Narrator's voice also adds a lot to the game; he is the one who walks you through vivid memories and reflections of the characters in the game, and without hardly any clips or unskippable sequences to accompany it. No other speaking voice besides the Narrator's is used, and I honestly wouldn't have it any other way; his descriptions and story-telling is really all you need, and adds to the feel of the game in a very positive way.The story of the game itself feels fresh, and is very interesting if you can keep up with listening to the Narrator while trying to fight your way through intense enemy sequences, which is my only real gripe. Then again, its best to save time and works more fluidly for him to explain while you are fighting in the area he is explaining. If you want to know the fine details of the story, you really can't afford to zone out for too long, because he describes things in simple sentences (that do the job and do it fantastically), but make it all the more harder to refocus and understand what just happened.The gameplay is very smooth and just works. No complaints there. As you travel through each region, the ground literally places itself piece by piece out in front of you, adding to the beauty and mystical vibe of the game. I love all the different weapons and skills you can equip and upgrade to use in battle; it makes everything more diverse and suitable to your playing style, which is kind of a standard for an RPG, but the game has its unique twist all the same. A drawback is that if you die, you have to start that region/level all over instead of having a checkpoint to teleport to. The enemies are varied, but they seem to have the same themes depending on which part of the game you are in and/or what region/level you are playing. They are not too difficult to defeat, but you can make it more challenging by using Divine Idols which can make enemies more resistant to attacks, hit harder, etc.Overall, this game is simply gorgeous and all-around fantastic, involving some of the best art styles, music, and usage of a Narrator I've ever seen. I would definitley reccomend to anyone who wants a great adventure with a good story.			",38,9,0,2,2,0,2

												Hands down one of my favourite games on Steam. I picked it up in a Humble Bundle but it is well worth even paying full price for.The narrative experience is one unlike any other game.  There's a reason they had the guy record a commentator pack for Dota 2; his voice will make you cream your pants.Gameplay-wise, the game is very solid. I cannot help but feel like certain weapons are more powerful than others, but the game does a good job at encouraging experimentation with every one of them while not forcing prolonged use.The only negative thing I have to say is that, at times, it can be unclear in a level whether or the path you're following is for progress or for extra's, and at times backtracking is impossible, leaving the player with a missed collectible. Levels cannot be replayed, so the player will then have to complete a full playthrough to find this last pickup.			",147,23,1,29,7,0,10

												The Kid and I introduce ourselves in kind. Both to him…and to each other, for the first time.Bastion is an Indie RPG with great artwork, heartbreaking story and amazing soundtrack. In the game you play as The Kid, young hero who tries to restore the bastion to its full potential. While you play, you discover different areas, different weapons and upgrade bonuses (spirits) and you customize your loadout the way you want it. For more hardcore gamers there are also challenges for each weapon and survival (Who Knows Where) mode which makes this relatively short game a little bit longer.I highly recommend this game for everybody.... I'll see you in the next one ...			",166,29,3,10,13,1,45

												Bastion, a really artsy action game. This game right here is one of the most artsy games i've played in a while. Bastion focuses mainly on story and gameplay with the awesome weapons powers and the narraratng from the well narrarator. He is one of the main parts of the game with the speach pattern being the most famous (I've seen many videos joking about it). The enemys in this game are nothing to right home about but they do offer a good challange at times. But where i love this game the most is the kind of villan in this game one of the survivor of the apocalypse who eventually goes insane and trashes your whole bastion island. Overall this game is artsy fun that just has to be played i give it my score of 5/5			",87,21,0,11,12,1,4

												This is one of very few action RPGs with a compelling story and good characters. If compelling stories and good characters are what you're looking for, play it. It's good. It's really good.It's not a stereotypical action RPG either. You start with your character waking up in his bed with all the world except the 10-foot radius around him just gone. When you walk, the world floats up and pieces itself back together in front of you. It's not only a cool visual effect. It's also part of the story's worldbuilding and a metaphor for the main character trying to piece his life back together after a catastrophic event that evidently left the world wiped out.Gameplay-wise, the action is skillful and fast -- much more skillful and much faster than I could handle at higher difficulties (note: difficulty levels are built into the game's lore, so that's pretty cool too). It's also fun and responsive, though the isometric perspective combined with the colorful levels and masses of objects and enemies alike moving around the screen at once, it can get confusing. It's never so confusing that it becomes unplayable, though. It just starts to feel a little like a bullet-hell shooter at times, and it's not even a shooter.The music's not getting out of here without a mention. I got the soundtrack in one of the Humble Bundles, and I've listened to it far more than any other video game soundtrack (except perhaps Metal Gear). It has an electro-western feel to it that's a bit difficult to describe. The lead acoustic guitar is tuned down to something odd that I tried out on my own guitar (note: just a simple open strum sounds cool in the tuning Bastion's music uses). There are vocals in a few of the songs, and they all come in at exactly the right time for the meaning of the song and the context in which they're played to punch you right in the feels. Sometimes, the music fits so well (mostly the instrumental stuff) that I didn't even realize it was there. It's incredibly unique for a game in the fantasy genre, and the same could be said of all the game's design, from art to writing to music and even to gameplay to an extent.Each weapon feels different and serves a different playstyle, which is more than can be said for nearly any other game in Bastion's genre. The Cael hammer, the default weapon and the one I used throughout nearly the whole game, feels like it has weight and power packed in every swing. The sword is quick and slicey, the guns are suitably punchy, and the bow is precise enough to feel great.If you thought Diablo was the king of the action RPG genre (any of the three), I request you try Bastion. At least in my opinion, it completely demolishes all three Diablo games in every area on which it contends (Bastion has no loot system, so there's no contest there): story, characters, art style, music, worldbuilding, combat, and probably a few I missed.Play Bastion. You'll be doing yourself a favor.			",142,25,1,25,11,1,11

												Bastion is yet another example of games where the gameplay itself is only a secondary part of the experience. Hacking and slashing through hordes of repetitive creatures in an isometric 3D environment would've been quite dull, weren't for the appealing art style, the always present and distinguishing voice-over narration, and the excellent soundtrack. The story, while supported by an interesting lore that can be seen reflected throughout the art of the game, doesn't get really interesting until it's final third, concluding in a very satisfatory ending. Although a console port, Bastion works well with a keyboard/mouse setup and didn't present any technical issues whatsoever. A great - and quite short - game, definitely worth experiencing.

												So freaking good. Almost five years later, it's a timeless masterpiece that you just want to keep playing more and more. At its core, it's a pretty simple story but it manages to charm and captivate like no other. The voiceover narration embedded into the gameplay is so expertly done. The soundtrack is easily one of the best ever in any form of entertainment, creating a new genre by itself. Combat it very satisfying and the game encourages you to try out different weapon combos and experiment with upgrades. There's plenty of totally optional ""proving grounds"" where, even if you fail the challenge, you learn something about how to best use a certain weapon. It's really well designed. The the upgrading and weapons system is quite in-depth for a game that looks so deceptively simple and playful from its tone. Passive bonuses from potions are great. There's a dynamic difficulty system where the player intentionally makes the game harder for themselves in exchange for more EXP, which is genius.All the areas are diverse and different enough so that you don't ever feel like you're doing the same thing twice. The handpainted environments are drop-dead gorgeous, only enhanced by the amazing soundtrack.I could go on for hours, but just buy the game. It's that good. ",65,16,0,5,3,0,5

												Bastion is labelled as an action role-playing game but feels more like “hack and slash” dungeon crawler due to its gameplay presentation and isometric view.  Bastion is set in a steampunk-like, post-apocalyptic fantasy world.  Quite a mouthful.A moving painting of watercolour, ink and chalk comes to mind when travelling the different areas.  The world builds as you walk along, summoned from the bottom of nothingness up right to your feet creating the area.  It fills it with which seems to be the destruction of a civilisation as well as nature moving back in or claiming it with either lushes green, invading and threatening red and sometimes the dull marshiness colour pallets.  It is definitely a visually crisp and stunning game.The story is simple enough to follow but details of the world may be lost due to how the story is presented.  You play as “The Kid”, pretty much a nameless character that not even the narrator cares enough to ask for his name.  You go through the City of Caelondia and other areas in the world collecting these crystal-like objects called Cores that will help rebuild the world.As you play, there is a dynamic voiceover by a narrator that presents the story as well as comments your unique actions in gameplay.  There is a sense of a tragic storybook feeling and the use of third-person narration (and sometimes second-person), there is disjoint between “you” as the player and “you” as “The Kid”.   You may be able to make choices in the game but “The Kid” is not you but you play as “The Kid”.  Bastion feels like a viewing of an active story instead of “playing” it.Bastion feels like a cross between a twin-stick shooter/action game and dungeon crawler.  Waves upon waves of enemies attack you and with a large variety of weapons and able to carry two of them and a unique skill, the combat is definitely fun and experimental.  Would you like to be up close and personal and later attack from a far?  You can equip a melee weapon of differing methods of damage, such as the hard hitting but slow “Cael Hammer” or the quick and range weapon able “War Machete”.  Range weapons also vary from the machine-like crossbow “Fang Repeater”, to cowboy-like “Dueling Pistols” or one-shot, long range accurate “Army Carbine”.Enemies have attack patterns that can be learned but I still found them challenging in terms of timing that hacking and slashing is the way to go most of the time.  One example of an enemy is the “Gasfella”.  Varies in a different sizes, where their damage differs as well as their pattern timing.  Then there are “Gasfellas” that spin attack, dash attack or destroys part of the world beneath your feet.Bastion has high replay value even with the new game plus feature, giving you the ability to experiment with all the weapons from the beginning as well as toggling “idols” that modifies enemies and increases the difficulty and challenge.I found the world immersive and wanting to learn more from it.  I hope it would be expanded with the mention of different tribes skilled with each weapon and how they contribute to the world.  I want to learn more about the different cultures, clashes and history of this world and replaying it again will allow me to be more attentive to it because I found the details easy to be missed because of the dynamic narration, either being distracted by fighting or roaming around.  However, its presentation of the story feels intentional.  Where the calamity has destroyed the past and is now told through the elder and experiences of the other characters becoming folk tales.Definitely a recommend. ",30,4,0,2,3,0,2

												Beautiful game with very simple mechanics but very competent at what it does. Carried by it's narrator, the story and the art style!The game itself is an isometric 2D action game with some very simple RPG elements. You can equip 2 weapons at anytime (each weapon can be upgraded 5 times and each time you can choose between two impromvements) from a growing arsenal of very different weapons. 2 melee weapons? 2 ranged weapons? A shotgun and a hammer? A bow and a machete? That's all up to you! Each weapon plays completely different and adds a lot of variety. Additionally you can equip a special skill for one of your 2 weapons or a weapon independent skill. You got also a shield to block and counter (with good timing) enemy attacks, a dodge roll and a button to drink heal tonics. So the basic mechanics are very simple but always spot on.  So while inexperienced gamers will probably enjoy this game (there is even an easy mode if you basically just want to enjoy the story), there are also a lot of challenges for hardcore gamers. For each weapon there is a location with a certain challenge and depending on how you perform you can unlock upgrade materials and skills for this weapon. While acing each challenge can be quite difficult (and rewarding) all this is completely optional. So if you don't like a weapon, there is no need in doing these. You can also invoke so called idols, basically deities, that each will add a certain challenge to the game. Enemies may just get tougher, drop bombs at death, deflect your attacks, and so on. But each invoked idol also increases the gained ingame currency and experience gained. So you can nicely tailor the difficulty to your likes.But the main reason, why you should play this game: The narrator. He will narrate and comment almost everything you do with such an awesome voice, it will get stuck in your head. For each weapon combination you equip, for each level you have to redo, because you failed the first time, he got a comment for you and the way he narrates the story is just beautiful. The story itself is also quite touching but is really supported by the way (and voice) of narration. The art style is also amazing and fits perfectly into the game and the story told.The first playthrough took me about 7 hours (with almost everything done) but I just started with NewGame+ that unlocks additional idols and let's you keep you all your upgrades. It's also nice how NewGame+ fits in with one of the 2 possible endings (you can choose between them in the end).The only thing I can actually critizise about this game is that restarting the weapon challenges takes a bit too much time if you already know that you can get the high score anymore. But that's also just a few seconds. And that you cannot replay levels that you've finished (you may have missed certain items) but that makes sense within the story.  Yeah...this game is awesome! Buy it!			",176,27,1,11,8,1,26

												A simple yet deep action game that plays well depending on your choice of controlsUpon first look into this top-down action game I was compelled to report that this was a simple game with simple mechanics, simple game play and a simple story.  Not soon after I completed the first area did I come to the understanding just how much depth was contained within this game despite the simplicity of the mechanics.  Bastion truly is an experience to be had despite its unorthodox art-style, soundtrack and narrative.  Like many games of the indie genre, it is a refreshing break away from the mainstream but still contains the clean and somewhat polished look of many mainstream action titles that holds a place for both casual and competitive gamers.  This title is not without its quirks but contains a wholly unique experience that drives players from area to area.The story of Bastion is one of hope and survival.  Though not being terribly deep, the story is able to propel players from each area to the next.  It is not one given to gamers in a mainstream way.  It comes to players as if they are hearing a story given from the perspective of a  soothing-voiced supporting character.  Though the narrative was told in a story-like fashion, I never felt like it forgot about what was happening on the screen.  It was interactive and reacted to what my character was doing in the various areas. The story tells of the Calamity, a single apocalyptic even that lays waste the land and has released many monsters to impede your progress.  Few people remain and those that you find on your journey join you at the Bastion, a safe haven and the future of your people.  You begin your journey as a boy that has just awoken to find the effects of the Calamity and is being lead by the narrative to the Bastion.  You begin to rebuild the Bastion that will save the world and must traverse many hostile areas to find crystal shards that give the Bastion core power to rebuild.  On your journey you meet just a few characters that add depth to the story.  They merely give information and are not intended to physically aid you in your journey.  They story unfolds into one of treachery and deceit and has you make a few very difficult decisions as you approach the end of the game.  Though initially surface level, the story become one that some players may become emotionally engaged in.  Overall, the story is great and the experience is solid.When it comes to game play in Bastion simplicity is the name of the game.  Everything from the controls to the mechanics scream simplicity.  This is not to be confused with the game being simple however.  There were many instances where I began slapping keys out of frustration on a particularly difficult segment of the game.  The top down action genre has generally been associated with games like old school Grand Theft Auto and Diablo, but Bastion brings a more hack n' slash element to the genre with its various weapons and real time action.  Initially there are just the basic moves such as the primary and secondary weapon actions.  There are simple dodge and defend mechanics as well.  However not far down the path you begin to realize that there are many seemingly trivial elements introduced during the opening area that are absolutely crucial to be successful in the following areas.  I was pleasantly surprised to come to an area where I was to only surpass by timing counter attacks perfectly or practice efficiency with a weapon by only being allowed a certain amount of shots.   Bastion is not without its quirks however.  Having the PC title allowed me to choose whether I wanted to use the keyboard and mouse or a game pad.  I was able to try both as I had an old Xbox360 controller lying around.  After some time and a sideways expression, I came to find that depending on the weapons you chose to utilize on your journey, your choice of input greatly decided the difficulty or simplicity of the game.  I found that using a mouse an keyboard was more difficult because you had to manually aim shots whereas the game pad had a lock-on feature.  I also found that navigating the world of Bastion was much more intuitive with a game pad.  However, the keyboard and mouse offered much greater ease when it came to using weapons that had area of affect damage because I could aim at a group as opposed to an individual enemy.  Overall, the game pad was easier to use on a far greater range of weapons.  In the end, I ended up using both my keyboard and mouse and the game pad.  This I felt was a quirk that could have been resolved by implementing an auto-aim feature on either input device that could be turned on or off on the fly.  The would have prevented the need to sometimes constantly switch input devices.  If a player has the Xbox360 version of the game, they are most definitely limited to using just a game pad as the Xbox360 does not support mouse input.I feel that Bastion is a very unique experience that anyone can enjoy.  It allows users to merely play a decently designed game or get engaged into the story.  It does so many things well that its easy to overlook its input quirks.  It allows for gamers of all skills and gives an engaging 4-6 hour experience.			",180,36,5,21,11,3,25

												Bastion, where do I even begin. I bought the game at first extremely hesitant because I read some of the negative reviews and they said it was boring, terrible, etc. Ignoring the reviews I blatently bought the game. When I first opened it I thought what a beautiful game, but nothing was happening yet. 30 minutes later, I was still playing it and boy was I absoluely drawn into it.This game is so addicting, and the artwork is absolutely astounding. The narraration is great and so is the dialog. The story is a little confusing but well put. The gameplay is extremely fun, except for the fact i'm really discordinated and kept falling off the land oops.This game for me is a 10/10. Would Reccomend Fully. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You are greeted by the gruff voice of a stranger. A voice that will be your guide, your mind and your comfort for the next six hours. You play the character of an unnamed Kid, who's job is to protect himself and other survivors from the aftermath of a calamity, and make ends meet on The Bastion: your safe haven. To do this you have to collect cores from the various locations around The Bastion and return them.During gameplay you look down upon The Kid and fend off enemies' attacks. You can improve your weapons back at The Bastion and the narrator will comment on your progress.The voice of the narrator and the soundtrack are the two things that bring the game from fun to brilliant. “Windbags ain’t much different than normal folks,” the narrator says as you crush one of the game’s enemies with your hammer. “All they want is a place to stay and a decent meal.” This makes smashing them that much harder. As for the soundtrack, it suits the mood perfectly; the whole experience drips with passionate artistry. If you are thinking of buying this game, you have no idea what you are getting into. You will come to know of the beauty of Bastion, but you shall never understand it.			",163,34,4,19,17,4,9

												A quick TL;DR, if you're buying the game on the spot; the interface is good, the story is interesting, the combat system is fun, just buy it if you're into the genre.The Interface is surprisingly user friendly. It's compatible with all sorts of things, from controllers to your plain mouse and keyboard. They're all pretty intuitive and easy to learn, so you'll get used to the controls quickly. It's also got your usual subtitles and your audio settings. You can have different profiles, which allows you to start over from scratch without destroying your perfect save. Tons of resolution options, too. Generally pretty solid.The story is pretty vague at first; you're a kid, well, you're The Kid, you wake up on a floating island miles away from sea level due to some apocalyptic event, and an omnipresent narrator voice is talking to you, describing your every move. I'd rather not go any further with the story (and you've heard this tons of times. Believe me, I also get tired of hearing this, but this is for real): you should experience it yourself. Supergiant prides itself on digging out lore out of seemingly nothing, it's practically a talent. This game has amazing replayability and you can easily get lost just slashing through everything. The game includes idols that will rise the stakes if you find it too easy. Oh, and the combat system? Love it. I'm biased, since I love hack and slash games, but this game features a diverse cast of weapons that you can mod for extra perks, letting you cherrypick your favorite perks. Will you go for extra damage, or settle for a higher critical chance? Besides weapons, you can drink spirits that will give you passive perks, from extra resistance to retaliating damage.There's not much that I can say about the artwork that hasn't been said. All of the art for the game is very impressive and, to top, very fitting. To close this, since we're talking about art, there's a reason the game is tagged with great soundtrack. The music is also very unique, the artist even giving it its own name (I seriously cannot remember what he called it, but it was a mouthful). Adds a lot of character to the game.Buy it. At best, you'll love it and play it again, and again, and again (or not, it's a 6-11 hour long game), at worst you'll play it once and be kind of okay about it. But if you're bent on getting all those achievements, you will clock out more hours than that. Just go play it. It's art.			",18,9,0,4,5,1,2

												For anyone who enjoys indie hack-and-slash, story-driven, and adventure games, I simply cannot recommend this game enough. I played through most of it on just one weekened, but it was a very refreshing and enjoyable game to just sit down and play. It was sad to see it over, but I played it again and again, super addictive. Worth the purchase, whether it's on sale or not.			",168,27,1,40,10,0,14

												Bastion is reminisint to the platformer style combat games I knew as a kid.This game has a beautiful, quirky, artstyle and colorful graphics, but it's main selling point in my opinion is the rich narration style storytelling and fluid, intuitive, combat system which caters to many different styles of play.I find myself playing through this game yet again for a third or fourth time with my new steam controller. It's a classic that I think most people would enjoy.			",62,7,0,6,2,0,3

												How do you turn a video game from being just entertainment, into an experience? Whatever the answer, Bastion nails it.Rather than being just a clever hack 'n' slash, run 'n' gun game, Bastion kicks it up a notch with an amazing soundtrack and a brilliantly written narrative. The story never stops the gameplay: it's delivered as you play, commenting on how well you're doing as you go. You'll lose yourself in the experience.If you like what you hear, watch the trailer. Now imagine that trailer for the rest of the game.			",35,2,1,0,1,1,1

												Short version: It's a good game with an awesome atmosphere and audio. Honestly it's too good to be an indie game and for it's price I'd definitely recommend buying it especially if it's on sale.What is Bastion? Well for me it was not only a game, but also an experience like Journey, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons and other similar games. An experience that I will always remember.The gameplay is pretty simple: you move around the isometric maps and kill enemies and occasional bosses using a variety of melee and long range weapons. A more interesting twist is that later on you can set difficulty level you want by activating up to ten shrines that give various buffs to your enemies. Playing certain levels with all of the shrines active can be quite challenging. There is also a ""New Game+"" option when you finish the game and since it has multiple ending it can be worth having second playthrough.The visuals are very nice. Each level is beautifully drawn and the level builds up under your feet as you move which makes the overall look even more appealing. The sounds. There are two sides worth mentioning. The music and the Stranger. The music is really good and fits the game great. I'd probably think about buying it if I hadn't gotten it together with Bastion in the Humble Bundle. The Stranger is this games most known feature. He is the narrator that talks about you and your journey with a deep and very nice voice. He is so popular they even made a Bastion announcer for Dota 2.All in all this game will probably leave a lasting memory and is a great experience. I have really enjoyed playing it and it's definitely worth it's price. I would definitely recommend you to try Bastion. You will not regret it. ",191,74,5,23,18,1,12

												In short: Bastion is a story driven isometric action game. It mixes strategy and skill to great effect and is quite challenging if it is underestimated. Also, it includes the vocal performance of the highly underrated Logan Cunningham. Other suggestions for those who like this game would be the upcoming Hyperlight Drifter, Lunar Knigts on the DS, and the Boktai series on the GBA. Highly reccomended			",92,4,2,11,1,1,3

This Raises My Platforms - An Official Waffle King Review~Find more here.[lordwaffleking.com]Morgan Freeman narrating anything makes it infinitely so much better. Unfortunately, not too many games feature Morgan Freeman. A rookie mistake. I mean, why would you specifically decide not to? Game design 101 here.But worry not. Some people still know how to make a game. I mean, it's not technically Morgan Freeman. But it's close enough.Bastion, a nifty fully-narrated action-RPG, is one of those games. It's one of those indie games. From India. They sure know how to make stuff down there.The world has broken into a million little pieces. And it's up to you to raise them all back up, by hitting things and walking around.An especially story-driven game, Bastion has an immersive, almost seductive atmosphere. The world is painted colorfully and vividly, the story told through short narrated clips. Like listening to your grandpa tell a story.""Eeyup. And then he walked over here, and hit the bad guy with a hammer. Mmmhmm. 'Course, back in my day we called 'em grizzly beaters. Those bears were always trying to climb through our windows, cause back then they were made of bubble-wrap. Eeyup, I remember the first time I fought a grizzly. My old hammer, we always called 'em Ol' Sledgie, we done fought a lot of bears together. But that was during the war, and President Truman said that there were tiny Japs piloting the bears. Aim for the back of the neck, they'd say. If you caught one, they'd take you to their pot of gold. Sweet, sweet gold. Just a few bars and you could afford real windows. But they had to have bumps on them to look like bubble-wrap, otherwise the bears would get smart and come through the chimney. Mmmhmm.""That's my interpretation of the game.So much of the story's power and emotion comes from the voice-acting. It's really quite phenomenal. The sound design in general is fantastic, and the soundtrack is a joy to listen to. There's something about listening to an old guy ramble on to the sound of acoustic strings that just works. It melds perfectly together, and gives the game a sort of western frontier vibe. In addition to grandpa's stories, there are quite a few powerful gameplay sequences that convey emotion perfectly. Bastion doesn't rely on holding your hand through cutscenes or long walls of text. The most tense and emotional scenes will be directly controlled by you, the player.Of course, the almost hypnotic narration and sort of old-timey western vibe aren't the only things this game has in common with some of grandpa's stories.Because this game is empty as ♥♥♥♥.The story might go on and on, but there's no real substance to it.As far as action-RPG's are concerned, Bastion is really not all that special. You'll discover a multitude of weapons throughout your quest, a mix of melee and projectile. There's quite a few of them. And you can equip two at a time.But each weapon is just what it is. The knife cuts. The hammer smashes. The gun shoots. There's no real depth to any of the weapons, and the battle system is just dull because of that. You can collect special skills too, but those require using up ""skill tonics"" and don't generally do much more than kill things faster and flashier.You'll enter a level, spot a monster, run over to it and mash the attack button until it's dead. Repeat until you beat the level.There's no depth, no substance, no hook to the gameplay. It's like your mom made broccoli and cheese, but you just licked the cheese off and left the broccoli. No one wants to eat the broccoli, because it tastes like♥♥♥♥♥ They just want the cheese. The outer part of the game is perfect, and you'll savor every moment licking it clean. But when you get down to its core, it's just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥broccoli. Or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥broccoli. That hyphen makes all the difference. Gross.As I progressed through the game, unlocking new weapons and skills, the game started to drag on quite a bit. I'd found a few weapons that I liked using, and generally gravitated towards and stuck to those weapons. Certain levels all but required using specific weapons, leaving you at a severe disadvantage if you didn't.But some weapons were just genuinely not fun to use or felt poorly balanced compared to other weapons. I just found a play-style I liked and tended to stick with it. Whenever I'd try other combinations of weapons, they didn't always work the way I'd wanted them to.There are mild customization options to each weapon, allowing you to do things like make your gun more of a sniping gun or more of a rapid-fire gun. Things like that. A nice touch that adds a bit more RPG to an otherwise bland button-masher. But it doesn't help too much in alleviating the repetitive gameplay.But not only did I play through the rest of the game after it started dragging on, I enjoyed it all. The atmosphere is really that good. Of course, when presented with the option to play the game all over again in New Game+ I did certainly hesitate.It's a fantastic gem of a game, and the design is definitely aesthetically pleasing. The gameplay might be a bit hollow, but it's still tolerable. It's definitely worth at least one playthrough. The world it paints is truly beautiful and touching, and really captures a specific essence in its story-telling. It's different, it's unique, and it's incredibly well-executed. I enjoyed my time with the game quite well.Fighting monsters? That's a paddlin'.Saving the world? That's a paddlin'.Upgrading your gear? That's a paddlin'.Talking to white, moustachioed Morgan Freeman? That's a paddlin'.This game's voice-acting?Oh, you better believe that’s a paddlin’.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's got a great variety of upgradeable wepons which are always fun to play around with. The range of enemies presents a decent challenge. Furthermore Bastions Soundtrack never feels out of place and even managed to create, at least for me, one of the most memorable moments in recent gaming history. ",189,35,6,32,13,2,20

												Bastion is a complete game that you will definitely enjoy while playing it. I think its because: +Beutiful story and simple to understand+Colorful world that achieved by HD ART with futuristic elements+Funny Narrator that will accompany you 'till you finish the game. +Incredible Voice acting and Sountrack. +Plenty weapons upgrades that allows you to choose and have a strategy on each level. +Replayability -yES! there is an option ""New Game Plus"" that is available after you complete the game. +4 endless level-waves so you don't get bored. I don't have any Cons. Totally worth your time... you won't regret it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A beautifuly crafted game, Bastion is one of the few games that can boast a colorful post-apocalypse enviroment, a relatable silent protagonist, and a rich lore that doesn't place too much detail on the uninteresting aspects of it. With gameplay that can be scaled up or down with an array of ""idols"", and enough-but-not-too-much weapon choice. The overall gameplay is solid and enjoyable with fights changing from one area to another without any clunkiness.Story-wise: the game gives itself enough room to create a universe without said universe creating plotholes. The Whole game is told from the perspective of the game's narrator who adds context to the kid's (your) actions without taking anything away. TL;DR: The game is all about story combined with balanced gameplay.			",99,6,0,10,11,2,7

												9.5/10Brilliant game. While I had a hard time understanding enough of the story on the first go around to really appreciate it, a quick googling of characters and major themes helps you understand some of the very strong poetic and moral messages of the game, which, once all the pieces of the plot came together, really was powerful.It played like a good book or piece of art: everyone has their own meaning attached to the events of the game, and it makes you re-evaluate your place in the world and assumptions on how life should operate. When you finish, the game will have meaning for you.It's truly a spectacular game. Gameplay can get a little route (though difficulty is adjustable), but that's not really the point, it's all about the story.			",126,47,4,11,18,4,12

												Originally, I couldn't imagine what the hype about Bastion was or even could be. After the demo alone I became acutely aware of just how amazing a game Bastion is. Not the longest of games, Bastion is neverthless more than good enough to compensate for this- especially with it's new game plus.And while it's typically the narrator that brings in buyers, for me it'd have to be the large selection of weapons for the player. Few action RPGs pack as diverse and fun a set of weapons as Bastion does.			",260,76,4,47,18,0,48

												Maybe a tad overrated as far as indie titles go, but it's definitely worth your time. The narration technique is the standout feature. The art and music will always keep your attention. The game does a fantastic job of pacing your advancement and keeping you hooked on achieving goals and unlocking gear. The only thing I didn't care for was the story. Maybe I just have a hard time caring for stories of such extreme, fantastical settings, but I had zero attachment to what was happening. That's fine though. Was easily worth the $5. I ended up stopping midway into New Game Plus and not unlocking all the gear upgrades.			",501,122,11,54,26,6,76

It is a true indie gem that I cannot convey my appretiation for to a satisfactory degree. All I can say is, I wholeheartedly recommend this, and hope that you will enjoy the outstanding journey Supergiant Games created.			",324,90,9,38,27,6,28

												Bastion is a great game with a story and action RPG elements. At first, my interest level in this game was quite low--even while playing, but once you start to unlock different ugprades/perks you really start to enjoy this game. If you're playing this game for achievements, prepare to play this game roughly 2-3 times from start to finish with one of those playthroughs being end-game grindy. I wouldn't say the achievements were necessarily fun, but at least the game made it so I wasn't tearing my hair out. A small tip for those wanting to get 100% achievements: First play through unlock all that is possible in normal mode. The next two playthroughs, you can literally speed run through the stages ignoring all enemies and items as the remaining achievements have nothing to do with them. xD.			",108,29,0,23,8,0,5

												Sets an absurdly high bar for indie games (and really, games in general across all generations/platforms) with its brilliant storytelling conceit, Jen Zee's lush visuals, Darren Korb's incredible trip-hop meets folktronica soundtrack (with special mention for Ashley Barrett's arresting vocals) and most importantly, tight and satisfying mechanics. Bastion trims just about every poorly defined or unnecessary design and narrative baggage and leaves you with a lean yet memorable experience.			",228,71,5,28,14,2,22

												Bastion is what I consider a really solid narrative with cool gameplay elements game. With it's timeless artstyle Bastion tells a story of a boy finding himself in a destroyed world surrounded by monsterlike creatures. As he fight his enemies with bows, hammers, shields and a bunch of other fun to use weapons, he meets some friends and hangs out at a base. From the base he travels around the destroyed world to find answers for what happens, collecting items to improve his weapons or make new ones.The game is around 6 hours long with various challagnes like an arena were you try to survive as long as you can and a new game mode. I defintly enjoyed my time with this game and I consider this a game worthy of being a classic, so go pick it up now!This game gets an 'G' for Good. (A>G>O)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is simply brilliant. Amazing. I have never played a game that is as good as this one. For only about 4 dollars you can get this game with the soundtrack. The gameplay is nice, an rpg style combat.The weapons are awesome, you can absolutely wreck enemies in this game with the right combinations of weapons and secret skills. You don't raise your stats by leveling up, instead you drink spirits in the Distillery which give you certain boosts and abilities. In the beginning you start with 1 slot but as you level up, the number increases. It's a good game mechanic imo to change what you usually do in rpgs. The story is really great. I won't say anything about it other than its great.The narrator does an awesome job of telling the story as the game goes on. Another one of the best things about this game is its soundtrack. Absolutely beautiful. I can't describe much on how good it is. If you're going to get this game please get the soundtrack too. You just need to. It's an obligation. In my opinion this games does a good job at what it does. It's one of my favorite games. If you're looking for a great time, pick this game up. I MUST recommend this to you.			",199,24,1,19,4,0,9

												The soundtrack! Just the soundtrack! It's possibly the best thing about this game. I have spent a good time just in the main menu listening to that guitar track.The world of Bastion is a wonderful world, there is nothing like it that I know of. All the little things like the skyway travel system in the hub or the fact you don't just have ""Special abilities"" you have black tonics. The Bastion itself and the characters are just wonderful and add to the world. The artistic design of the whole world is very different but also very good such as how the floor appears and builds itself underneath you as you walk. The game itself is not a massive graphically demanding shiney game like Crysis but it still looks lovely due to the art and aesthetic.The combat is kind of simple but is fine tuned and very skilful. You rely on your skill in fighting and dodging to win, just spamming the attack button won't work. The upgrades is very much the same, it's simple but effective. None of the weapons become over powered by any upgrades, they are merely just your personal play style. Do you want to use the great big two handed Cael Hammer or use the fast shooting and nimble Fanged Repeater?The story is a bit grim, taking place after what is just called ""The Calamity"" which you are slowly fed information about along with the rest of the background story but it is done so well. This is due to the narrator who is possibly the best voiced and best paced narrator I have ever heard besides maybe Thomas Was Alone. It is done so well i would recommend the game purely for that. But thankfully Bastion is great is every regard and so i can recommend it for everything. Which I do.			",219,25,2,22,43,4,64

												An unexpectedly nice indie game with a nice sense of platform-like gameplay. A story that travels you into a place and time out of the ordinary, with very well designed characters and interesting RPG elements and very friendly gameplay.The music some times is really nice and the whole story wins you. However it is very short, way too short to even complete most of the skills during one game play.Enjoyed it very much and totally recommend it. Most def worth buying during an offer since I can't say the price of  €13,99 is what you should give. I also didn't buy the soundtrack since there are like only 2 very nice actual pieces out of all OST (and you can enjoy them to the max on youtube anyway) - Better do it if you feel you wanna support the creators.Short but overwhelming experience.Thumbs up			",168,14,7,16,7,0,7

												Do you want a game with a narrator whose voice is deep, gravely, and utterly compelling? Do you want a game that explores the devastation of a post-apocalyptic world and a boy's attempt to piece everything back together again? Do you want a story about redemption? Do you want a story that grips you, immerses you, strokes you tenderly at night while the soft glow of your computer screen beckons you to play just a little more? You want this game. You want the multitude of weapons you can command, that you can switch when you realize your strategy isn't working. You want the voice that narrates your actions, the voice of an old man who's seen too much and still tries anyway because of the actions of a boy who woke up alone. You want the soft, haunting melody, humming ""I dig my hole you build a wall,"" and the foray into the characters' memories. You want the hope that people will continue on despite devastation. You want the hope that you can save other survivors.You want to be immersed, to taste the ash and dust of the wasteland around you. One step after the other, the hammer heavy in your hand, your heart even heavier in your chest.Buy this game. You will not be disappointed.			",17,11,0,11,5,0,0

												Bastion is a unique game in the sense that it focuses on narration. There is this dude telling you about the destruction of the old world caused by the Calamity, and you are set on a quest to obtain Shards, pieces of the old world so that you can rebuilt it.During this journey, you will discover:- A variety of weapons each with their unique special skill(s)- A variety of upgrades to each of these weapons- A unique challenge for each weapon to see how good you are with it, with the 1st prize usually requiring a number of tries- A few side quests where you fight waves of enemies to find out more about each character(May have a few more but these are the highlights for me.)The game play can be really easy or hard. This is because you can choose to invoke a number of Idols (up to 10) at the Shrine, each giving enemies a unique power-up. I played the last few levels with 6 Idols invoked, cos any more and I would fail and had to restart.At the very end, you have to make two choices that will directly affect the end screen. The second choice will also trigger two separate steam achievements, so achievement junkies like me will have to replay the game on new game +. While there isn't much replay value (enemies don't get tougher automatically), I guess you could invoke all 10 Idols for the maximum difficulty.Overall amazing art and great soundtrack with average game-play (gets old). I think the narrator did a great job, and he even has an announcer pack for Dota 2!8.5/10			",62,8,1,8,1,0,1

The first time I played it, I couldn't get off it. I was at least on it for an hour or two. The gameplay and the narration throughout the game is brilliant. It just makes you want to play more.

												Bastion is a lot of fun.  There are many different weaponsets to choose from and together with the distilery, a multitude of ways to customize your character.  The story is great, but if you are the type of person who likes to know everything about a story you won't get that.  The songs in this game are also great!			",46,4,3,3,2,0,2

I assure you, if they aren't at least half-engrossed watching it as you are playing it, you have an idiot buddy. This game is cheap, awesome, and original. If there were only one slot open for preserving a perfect example of what this medium can do, I'd pick this game. Then stash all my favorites in a cache for someone else to find.Get this game.

Although the story is not very long, it was still very enjoyable and I like the variety of weapons that we can use as well. I would definitely recommend this game to those who are interested in it.

												I just completed this game and other than that familiar sense of accomplishment I'm delighted with the experience.The game caught me since the first 2 minutes with a narrative that makes you look around wherever you are playing and ask ""are they talking to me?""The visuals are outstanding, fluent and vibrant. I fell a few times at the beginning (and accross the game I must confess) because I was distracted with all the details. Eventhou you can get used to the fight mechanics, the game puts a few surprises specially with the very last weapon.This is not a game to be creative regarding decisions and follow your own path but is flexible regarding how you walk that path now and then.After completing it I will give it a second try since lets you decide the way that you want to make the game more difficult (enemies with more endurance or speed, resources limitation, etc) and I can just imagine the pain that will be with all the challenges enabled.I give it a 9/10			",60,13,0,3,0,0,1

												Bastion is one of those indy titles that took the dedicated gaming community by storm, but it deserved to be so much more. Thinking back on the more than 30 hours I sunk into the campaign and challenges of this game, I can't come up with a single fault. The art style is beautiful, the combat is simple but robust and at the more difficult stages becomes shockingly deep. The story is very well written and concieved; but dear god the narration. The narration in this game is a thing of absolute beauty. And if for no other reason, everyone should play through this game just to see how powerful well designed narration can be.Buy this game and play it all the way through, you won't be disappointed.

												Truly a work of art. You can find lots of games with similar combat but few, if any, could rival Bastion's art direction or narrative.  Has multiple endings. I'll probably replay it on New Game + in order to experience it. I definitely reccomend picking this game up at some point if you are interested in a good narrative. If you only care about gameplay and you tend to skip cutscenes and dialogue then you may find this title lackluster. However, even if you are a cutscene-skipper, pick it up on sale some time and give it a chance. It's worth checking out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The gameplay is not exceptional; merely solid. Where the game shines is in the story, which is essentially the paramount attribute of a great game. And what a story it is, I won't go into details but it's one that legitimizes the idea of video games as an art form.			",374,136,3,30,32,2,33

												This is a very good game that deserves your time if you can pick it up on sale. I only say this because it is such a short game (I only clocked in about 5.5 hours) and has very little replay value. The art style is amazing and the story is great as well. What I found to be the main attraction, however, is the narration. The narrator was so good that he even did an announcer pack for Dota 2 (which I bought immediately after completing this game). It's very easy for me to recommend this game to everyone. The game didn't last very long, but I enjoyed every second of it. 9/10.			",152,13,4,27,13,3,9

												Bastion is one of those games that will really stick with you once you complete it. Though the gameplay can be frustrating at times, especially because of the isometric viewpoint, the story is absolutely incredible. You explore the crumbling remnants of a ravaged world, trying to restore the Bastion, the one safe haven still available. As the game progresses, the story becomes even more engrossing, making it harder and harder to stop playing. The last few minutes, from the final portion of the last level to the end of the credits, is undoubtedly one of the best moments in gaming. Bastion is a phenomenal game, and I am still thinking about it even now. Definitely worth buying!			",28,66,0,7,6,0,12

												Amazing. The 'Hack n Slash' tag doesnt suit a game with this much Depth. Most RPGs have different weapons, but more like an upgrade as you progress. But these weapons are purely on what your style is. Ive seen people ace with weapons i didnt even consider. And i feel it hard and unnatural to switch. Beauty in my opinion.Amazing music. Makes you want to buy the soundtrack. Art style was different, but Perfect.Narration is really cool. Never found it too distracting or corny, etc. Not something you see anywhere else.The story and the dynamics too were very complex and especially the ending makes you think. Alltogether, This was the best game i never expected anything from.I did feel this would be better with a controller just for the movement directions, doesnt come in the way of gameplay though.

He finds the Bastion(along with a few characters)and has to collect these items called cores and shards to rebuild the Bastion and save the world basically,and you can choose between an evacuation or restoration ending.The characters are pretty likable,my personal fav of course being The Kid and the narrator.The music is really good,especially the main menu and credits themes. :)The gameplay is really good too. The ground forms under your feet as you go through the level which looks pretty cool. Gameplay is like an indie RPG brawler sort of thing.Anyway I highly recommend it to those that have not played it before or played a game like it before,I can guarantee you you're gonna like it9.8/10 from me :) ",121,25,1,11,4,1,4

It is one of the greatest storylines in a game that I have played for quite a while.The ”reactive narrator” brings the storytelling much more to life as he comments almost your every move.As one of my friends also mentioned: You have a lot of different weapons, upgrades and skills to choose from, so you can (as he put it) ”wreck your enemies in just about any way you want to”.There is weapons for people who like melee and weapons for people who like range. And you can also compbine the two.And not only has this game got all of this ^It has also got some great artwork and a great feeling.I am a little sad that I had this game in my library for such a long time before actually playing it, because this is a great game and sadly I didn't notice that before now.

												Just know, I have out time into this offline, on my X-Box, and PS3! I have alot more experiance then the time it says I have put in.     Bastion is a game of story. The game is a almost 3D-isometric-ish hack and slash. There are alot of wepons, abilities, sidequests, options, and so much more. The controls are sweet too!   You wake up as a character called ""The Kid""( as most characters are only referred to as The ????). After making your way throught the first level you learn a little about the story through The Narrarator. The world is expanded upon much more the there are a even a few tear jerking moments in there You can find several relics to give to people you will start pooling to the hub to learn more about the lore of The KId and the mythical world of his.   There are many wepons and abilities, as I have said. All wepons are found throughout the story along with some abilites. No wepons are missable. Stores in the hub(we'll get to that) can sell permant equipments(Spirits) and upgrades for your kicking wepons(assuming you have obtained the ingredients).   The game is traversed through the hub, the Bastion. The skyways(teleporters) can shoot you to missions or extra stages. Most of the time the game gives you several levels to choose from, although you have to complete them all, just in any order.  In the earlier mentioned extra stages you can play challenges based on one wepon. You can win money, a upgrade ingredient and a specilzed ability for that wepon.  Completing the story will allow you to upgrade the hub with stores. These range from the shrine for sidequests, to the Lost and Found to buy missed ingrediants and relics(even though you can backtrack), along with some uniqe spirits and abilites.  The story (and action) is complimented by  the awesome soundtrack, it can pump you up, get you down,♥♥♥♥♥♥you off, anything!If you didn't get the message, buy this game!			",86,26,1,21,23,0,17

												Atmosphere is unbeatable.  Combat is outstanding.  The game has a particular style, which is pulled off excellently by use of locations, graphics, music, narraration, and characters.  Even weapons and combat seem built into the atmosphere.This game was amazingly fun.  The farther you go, the more exciting it gets.  Check out the video on its steam store page, and just imagine playing with that sexy old guy's voice commenting about everything that happens... it's like you're really a part of a story... a kind of legend.I highly recommend this one.

												Bastion is what I consider a really solid narrative with cool gameplay elements game. With it's timeless artstyle Bastion tells a story of a boy finding himself in a destroyed world surrounded by monsterlike creatures. As he fight his enemies with bows, hammers, shields and a bunch of other fun to use weapons, he meets some friends and hangs out at a base. From the base he travels around the destroyed world to find answers for what happens, collecting items to improve his weapons or make new ones.The game is around 6 hours long with various challagnes like an arena were you try to survive as long as you can and a new game mode. I defintly enjoyed my time with this game and I consider this a game worthy of being a classic, so go pick it up now!This game gets an 'G' for Good. (A>G>O)			",55,12,0,11,5,0,9

												The soundtrack! Just the soundtrack! It's possibly the best thing about this game. I have spent a good time just in the main menu listening to that guitar track.The world of Bastion is a wonderful world, there is nothing like it that I know of. All the little things like the skyway travel system in the hub or the fact you don't just have ""Special abilities"" you have black tonics. The Bastion itself and the characters are just wonderful and add to the world. The artistic design of the whole world is very different but also very good such as how the floor appears and builds itself underneath you as you walk. The game itself is not a massive graphically demanding shiney game like Crysis but it still looks lovely due to the art and aesthetic.The combat is kind of simple but is fine tuned and very skilful. You rely on your skill in fighting and dodging to win, just spamming the attack button won't work. The upgrades is very much the same, it's simple but effective. None of the weapons become over powered by any upgrades, they are merely just your personal play style. Do you want to use the great big two handed Cael Hammer or use the fast shooting and nimble Fanged Repeater?The story is a bit grim, taking place after what is just called ""The Calamity"" which you are slowly fed information about along with the rest of the background story but it is done so well. This is due to the narrator who is possibly the best voiced and best paced narrator I have ever heard besides maybe Thomas Was Alone. It is done so well i would recommend the game purely for that. But thankfully Bastion is great is every regard and so i can recommend it for everything. Which I do.			",219,25,2,22,43,4,64

												Great visuals, a worthwhile soundtrack, and an incredible narrative delivered in a unique way make this isometric action RPG a worthwhile addition to your library. Bastion seemed like a typical addition to the genre at first, but once the story picked up, I couldn't stop playing. The game's most unfortunate shortcoming is that it's a very short romp--less than 10 hours if you don't hunt down achievements. There's a decent amount of replayability here with New Game Plus and Score Attack modes, but even with those small additions and everything else the game has going for it, I'm a little reluctant to recommend it at its normal price. Definitely pick it up when it goes on sale, though.			",1354,349,42,84,95,8,80

												A tremendous, perhaps even startling achievement, ""Bastion"" is everything great in gaming.It starts with a tremendously accessible and altogether fluid control system that works beautifully on PC. It adds to that a number of ""micro-customizations"" that let you nudge the core mechanics towards your favored playstyle. These micro-customizations take the form of weapons, weapon upgrades, ""spirits"" that act as passive skills, and shrine idols that make things tougher.On top of that, the game places very nicely crafted art. ""Bastion's"" visual stylings are highly distinctive, fun to look at, and also completely functional as a gameplay element.The final layer is a wrenching, yet never overdone or melodramatic story. There are very rich, mysterious elements that get woven in to fire up your imagination, and those elements are given with the same sensitivity and subtlety as the character arcs. The story is told almost entirely through gameplay, which keeps the narrative entirely connected to what's going on....and that soundtrack. Goodness gracious, that soundtrack. A person could buy this game for the sole purpose of listening to it. The music is superb (especially the main theme and the blues/ Americana tinged tracks) and the narrator could read a phone book without becoming tiresome.As far as I can tell, ""Bastion"" is flawless.

												Wow. Isometric and *gorgeous* in every sense of the word. Bastion hits every note on an artistic standpoint, nevermind the flaws action combat. It's only flaw may be the slow momentum that it begins with, but it feels like a rolling start to an epic adventure as such adventures go.The deep voice of the narrator guides your entire adventure with trolling quips, anecdots, and hints all in a snippy but fatherly manner. I couldn't wait for all the different weapons to start showing up: the whole world to expanded. Plenty here for one of the best Indy titles I've played to date.			",259,45,2,29,19,1,47

There's a short pro/con list at the end of this review, if you don't feel like reading this whole bunch of text.ReviewBastion is one of those games you just have to fall in love with 'cause it's incredibly intriguing from the very beginning.The story takes place in the fictional city of Caelondia and its surroundings, now fractured because of a catastrophe called the Calamity. The Calamity broke the world apart and turned nearly all its inhabitants to ash. Now, the pieces of this world float in the sky, and the Kid (the protagonist of the game) awakens on one of these pieces. He sets out to reach the Bastion, a place said to be safe in times of trouble.One of the many things I love about Bastion is how you build the world around you by exploring it. Your path forms in front of you as you fight your way through enemies and investigate the area. This, as well as the use of vivid colors, make the world feel very lively, despite the destruction the Calamity has brought upon Caelondia.Also, the soundtrack is amazing. Seriously, buy it, it's gold.Bastion is labeled as an action role-playing game, but I would specify that and call it a hack-and-slay game because of its focus on combat and variety of weapons (you're welcome to disagree with that point, but I think genres to be quite squishy anyway; Bastion just feels more like a hack-and-slay game to me). There we have another thing I love about this game: you can choose from plenty of weapons and combine them any way you want.There are 11 unique items, either melee or ranged weapons, and you can carry two at once. By default, you equip one melee and one ranged weapon, but you can replace them anytime at the Armory. You want to carry two melee weapons, for example your trusty Cael Hammer AND the War Machete? No problem. Two ranged weapons, let's say, the Scrap Musket in combination with the Breaker's Bow? Why not?The third equipment slot is reserved for Secret Skills you find, win, or buy later in the game.There are many more possibilities to customize your character, for example Spirits providing passive bonuses; let's just say, you can choose equipment from a REALLY great range of thingies.My favorite thing about Bastion, though, is the narrative style. The Kid himself is silent throughout the whole game, but there is a narrator whose voice accompanies the protagonist, providing the player with background information and reacting to what he or she chooses to do.The voice is so incredibly great; really calm but rough at the same time. It feels like it belongs to an older, experienced man who grew a little tired of all the stuff happening around him after years of turmoil - and I think that is perfect. You get the feeling that you're hanging out in a pub, and you meet an aged man who tells you stories about his life as a young adventurer. This may be the greatest thing about Bastion - that you feel like you get to know the narrator, like he personally speaks to you and no one else.All in all, I think Bastion might be one of the most beautiful games set in a post-apocalyptic world I've ever played. The art style and soundtrack go so well with the atmosphere, and the narrative style is breathtaking. The gameplay is really fun and allows for a lot of customization. I already recommend it to anyone who's into video games, and I don't think you would regret playing it.Short list for everyone who's too lazy to read this:• multiple endings• playtime (first run, didn't finish 100 % of the game) approx. 11 hoursPros:+ beautiful graphics+ amazing soundtrack+ 11 unique weapons (melee as well as ranged weapons), all upgradeable+ high customizability (e.g. weapons, Spirits, etc.)+ extraordinary narrative style+ stunning voice acting+ collectibles and side quests/challenges (e.g. mementos, proving grounds for each weapon, vigils)+ great control over difficulty level (you can activate up to 10 Idols, each making enemies stronger in some way and rewarding you with more XP and fragments in return; great system in my opinion)Cons:- New Game+ Mode doesn't offer anything too special			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First off, this game is amazing, and a must buy.Let me tell you why this is so. This game has a very unique artstyle, and not in a bad way. It's probably one of the best looking games I've had the pleasure to play. The art really gives an atmosphere to the game, which is lacking in most games (In my oppinion). Another thing done to almost perfection, is the music. The music in this game blew me away, it's action-packed when needed and it's a bit.. ""toned down"" and emotional, when it's needed. This contributes alot to the atomphere of the game aswell.The main focus of the game, and the thing you'll be doing the most, is using various weapons to kill creatures, critters and other living things. The game ALSO does great in this part. The combat is responsive, and does not feel like a ""mash-to-win"" thing. It also requires an amount of skill to master. This is empathised by the game it self, as it has ""Training Grounds"" where you can unlock 3 tiers of rewards, depending on how good you do a task, where the third tier is perfecting the task (Which is very difficult). This combat system if what I'd call an ""easy to learn, hard to master"" kind of thing. The game has around 10 weapons, where around half of them are ranged and the other half melee. You also get a ""secret skill"" which is like a special move, but you can't use it all the time, it has a resource attached to it which you can hold 3 of. You can upgrade your weapons aswell, It's almost impossible to upgrade them all. That's all I'm going to say on that.Now I think it's time to talk about the story. It's great. I'm not a ""story guy"" as I apreciate good mechanics instead of a great story. But since this has great mechanics, I started to focus on the story aswell. I'm scared to say anything about it, I'd recomend you to go experience it for yourself. The levels them self don't get boring either. They are kind of being built, as you go along the path. That's the way this game does secrets aswell, which there are a few of. This makes the levels feel very dynamic, as they're kind of built on the spot. So now I'm going to repeat my self... Go buy this game. It's worth the price.			",172,29,4,20,25,2,19

I don´t think is a must buy for everybody (it is for me, i almost cried with the epicness of the OST meanwhile you do your choices at the end) i would like to see this game go on with its history sadly i don´t think there will be a Bastion 2.

												Fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. Don't let's it's simplistic graphics fool you, Bastion is an incredible gaming experience with so much to offer, being very unique in a world filled with games that follow the same generic algorithm. It's controls are simple, easy to pick up and use but at the same time taking time and practice to master. What really makes Bastion a must-play is it's incredible voice acting, narration and soundtrack. While the enemies and combat mechanics seem a bit ""Spiral Knight-ish"", it's easy to overlook that when facing the big picture, Bastion has everything that Spiral Knights didn't, breath-taking music, immersive narration by a very talented actor, fantastic art style and storyline to complement it all, wrapping it all with in a neat bow for what could easily be the greatest birds-eye beat 'em up action RPG on the market.Do not miss this game, it is next to perfect!

												Bastion is one of my favorite games in recent years. It also might be my #1 Indie game. Although there may not be anything completely original in this title, the way the game is presented feels different from the majority of games I've played. They keep a lot of tried and true mechanics (e.g. upgradable weapons and character, multiple levels categorized by zones, home base where you will upgrade and customize your character, and unlockable arena battles to test your skills) but they've added plenty of charm and character to this title that keep it fresh. The narrator is one of the most memorable parts of the game and you will learn most of the world's lore and story progression via his soothing voice. The controls are very tight and almost perfect. The way you can alter your difficulty with the idols you unlock is also a nice feature that forces you to adjust your fighting technique if you want to face these self-imposed challenges. I finished the game several months ago for the 5th time, but keep reminiscing about the music, weapon loadout and the final, tough-as-nails dream challenge.9.5/10			",435,146,11,46,26,5,52

												Bastion follows the life of a survivor of an apocalyptic event. It does this through a process of narrating the player as they make their way through the levels. I initially found the narration a bit jarring, but once I got into the game it became clear that this was a really good way of telling a story.The gameplay focuses on top-down two-dimensional movement, using a variety of weapons & abilities. Everything is well varied and leads you about in a linear manner, but with enough space for you to get a feel of it being open-world.Playing using a mouse & keyboard set up gave me no difficulties. The controls are easy to learn and use.The graphics in this game are very ""traditional"" in feel, everything having a sort of painted-over imaginary look rather than being really precise. Yet it is still very high quality.Given that there is a high emphasis on narration in this game I would reccomend you play about with the music/sound settings to get a good balance so you can clearly hear the narration. The music involved had a sort of ""desolate"" feel to it, and not quite to my tastes, but it is still very well composed.Once the game is completed, you can unlock a game+ mode, which fully unlocks levels & extra challenges. There is also a pre-unlocked ""no sweat mode"" for people who want an easier play-through.I found no bugs in this game at all, it is really well-polished.This game is really worth a play if you like story-driven games, and if you like a (apocalyptic) fantasy type of setting.

												This game is G-O-R-G-E-O-U-S like unbelievably so you can tell they put an empashis and made it a point of pride in this game. The story makes for a pretty decent metaphor. The Voice acting and music is truly top notch. The gameplay is decent for a game that was clearly made for many platforms, it can be a little wonky at times on the PC. The game is pretty short and I don't feel too much wanting to replay it for a while. It is inexpensive especially on sale. Pick it up is well worth it. Again the art is amazing.

												I originally played Bastion on Xbox, but it was good enough for me to buy again during a Steam sale!The thing that Bastion does right that so many other games seem to forget is that audio is a big part of a game. Sound aids in immersion and it is one reason why I watch anime over reading manga. That is really what makes Bastion great. The game-play by itself is just passable; the music and narration make it an amazing experience.			",194,44,0,53,18,0,40

												Bastion is what I consider the ultimate example of pacing in a videogame. The game hits you hard with major challenges early on, and steadily ramps up the difficulty while also providing a lot of new weapons and concepts to the player steadily. What's more, the game never keeps you pinned down in one spot for too long. There's always some new interesting weapon combo to try out, and new challenges to try them out on. The narrator and story presentation tie into this perfectly, keeping the storyline moving at a good stint along with the rest of the game. Bastion isn't a very long game, but it's a very dense experience - there's a lot to take in during that short time period, on all levels.			",300,66,3,37,11,1,45

												7/10 - Charming game, fun combat, rewarding upgrade system, an interesting story and setting, and of course the narration really makes it shine. Not much to say that hasn't already been said. Goes on maybe a bit longer than I'd have liked, and there were a few points here and there that felt either unfairly difficult (some of the challenge arenas basically requiring absolute perfect economy of movement/action) or far easier than the plot would have suggested (most of the major encounters towards the end of the game felt rather inconsequential despite the increasing significance). Still, a great game nonetheless.			",238,94,3,41,34,3,28

												Bastion is a visually spectacular work of art that is nothing like what you expected it to be, but in a good way. Game play wise, Bastion doesn’t bring many new cards to the table, but what it does, it does well. This is a mechanically strong hack and slash RPG with a few nice touches such as good selection or varied weapons, all of which are upgradeable, the ability to pick your own difficultly by “worshiping” certain gods, a home base which can be upgraded throughout the course of the game, and a spirit (the beverage) based system which lets you tailer the your character to your own tastes.The game itself is focused almost completely on fighting your through levels, upgrade your weapons and fight your way through more level, which this might come across and bland, to some, the constant stream of upgrades keeps it fresh as you unlock new weapons and abilities which often keeps you wondering what reward will you encounter next.All levels appear to be hand painted affairs, which rival the art in games such as Braid and Capsized, they consist of parts of a once prosperous, but now shattered floating city, the parts of which literally fall into place as you explore the landscape, an effect which doesn’t seem to get too old. As you explore the levels, the narrator, voiced by the seductively smooth Logan Cunningham explains what you are seeing and how the world used to be, occasionally commenting upon your own actions which bring you into the game, often purposely steering from the task at hand and even throwing yourself off a platform to see how he would respond.The music is brilliant in its own right, comprising of a generally “wild west” theme mixed with more contemporary beats and the occasional South Asian flavour, offering some stand-out tracks which are pleasant and also relevant to the characters and their stories.The story itself was diverse enough to make one invest in their character and the world, with enough subtle twists that one would find it genuinely interesting and caring about how the characters would be affected as the story unfolds.Although the 3D models of the characters were adequate, they do stand out against the beautiful 2D hand-painted backdrops of the broken world, a not to forget the ease at which one could fall off the platforms in some situations. Where this game shines is the presentation, everything from the outstanding narrative, to the story, art and music which are all of a high quality and to experience more of it is what really drive this game forward.

												The customer came to the Steam Reviews section.  Paged down, paged down. What the hell was this one? It seemed to be talking about them, instead of to them, about the game Bastion.  ""What the hell is this?"" the customer thought to themselves. They considered it. Isometric - the long flat angles of hand-drawn artwork. Was it like Diablo? The ranks of monsters, of course, but were they demon-maddened, suffused with the craving for additional credit card transactions? No, definitely not, surely someone would say that if that was happening. An ordinary tale, simple characters moving direct to what they desired, and a story you could feel unspool like a cat with a ball of yarn. But what dark thing lurked beneath the fluffy colored twine? What was the thing that would roll out before you at the end and make you look back at all the mess you made? The review didn't say. The customer clicked ""Add to Cart"".  The customer clicked ""Add all DLC to Cart"". It was that kind of night.			",550,252,5,110,35,2,113

												A very cool game, with one hell of a narrator, and some of the greatest 'game writing' ever. The difficulty curve is where it should be, and skill progression felt natural. There aren't any complaints that come to mind when thinking about this game, other than a 'split choice' ending - where I really wanted to know the outcome of each choice before making it, and would have rather had one ending held off as a 'real' ending until a second playthrough - but I suppose that would have been a♥♥♥♥♥♥move. So kudos to these guys. Next stop: Transistor.			",179,47,2,9,5,2,23

It is a gut jerking novel about life and the choices we make as people when the world comes to an end.

												A fantastic example of a GOOD style-driven game - the best I've played maybe since the first Viewtiful Joe. (Note: This is somber, not bombastic like VJ. Just so you don't get the wrong idea.) There's some balance issues which make the customization a little less than it could be, but there's enough viable options that you won't mind. Solid Zelda-Style combat and lots of atmosphere. It would be too short as a full-priced game, but it's all quality, and at this price it's a bargain. If you have a weekend to kill and like listening to vaguely philosophical drawls in westerns, then you can't go wrong with Bastion.			",205,29,0,47,34,1,40

												8/10 - Beautiful game (visually as well as gameplay), really enjoyed it.- Easy in overall difficulty with options to increase difficulty for bonus exp rewards (which can make it quite challenging)- Plenty of balanced weapons that fit vastly different play stylesOne complaint I do have about the game is the way that new weapons and skills are introduced: you receive new weapons in an un-upgraded form and are forced to play with a seemingly under-powered weapon.  After a hard time during the level due to the new weapon, you probably won't take it out for another spin.  This creates a bias for the starting weapons unless you really like to experiment.

												Bastion is a strange game best known for it's narrator which is more like a commentator but is done so well that you never get annoyed by him repeating itself.The art is amazing as the ground raises from the bottom of the screen so you can walk on which makes exploring and finding secrets very rewarding. The general appearance of the levels and characters is very well done and thought out. Though I diddnt like the isometric type of view I wasnt punished by falling off the edge with a loss of life, the isometric view gives you the gods eye view which obviously works well with the narrator.The combat got repetitive but it was challenging you are able to block and use melee and ranged weapons. There are multiple weapons and you are able to customize your character even to suit the style you want such as using an arrow and a blunderbuss or 2 different melee weapons, or the 1 melee weapon and 1 ranged weapon. But you will always have a shield in Bastion which does resemble an old shoot em up at times.Bastion has a lot of life with it's replayability, the god shrine is a great idea, letting the enemy get stronger and getting more experience is a great idea. I finished the game and was given the option to play through it again but with all the unlocks available so its a great game for the completionists out there.Though I do believe it is overrated just a bit it obviously gets a lot of attention because of the narrator. If you like a challenge and good game design play! ",191,16,2,11,20,1,10

												Bastion is one of those games that catches you on the first two minutes of playing. Features lots of perks which, even if we are used to it, the game itself just gives you a well-rounded complete experience, be it you want a challenging game or just a good hearing at the beautiful story of the tribulations your character has to complete. Providing of beautiful, aesthetic and well-done stages where the action takes place, accompanied by astounding and fitting soundtracks for each of them, you will feel an unbelievable harmony throughout all the game. The story, on the other side will captivate you; every finding, every bit of information that will come to fill you in of what happened (and what is happening) on every minute will expand the picture of what you are doing, and the motivation of your character. The variety of weapons and powerups (in form of pretty clever liquor names), as well as techniques and characters, along the freedom of chosing whatever two weapons you desire, will make your gameplay a blast as whatever you feel like sporting any given second; ber it you want to feel like the sharpest bowman, the fastest gunslinger or even a badass guy with a full-automatic repeater, choices are vast. The icing on the cake is the perfect noir-like voice and style narrator that goes with you during the whole experience (If you ever liked Sin City [movie] narration style, you will fall in love with this one), will eliminate every bit of anything you could find repetitive or boring. Bastion, in a few words, is a game to remember.			",73,6,3,8,5,3,8

												Bastion is a great game filled with a great story, an awesome soundtrack, a stunning narration, and beautiful art style that's marked a before and an after for indie games.The gameplay, action oriented hack and slash-type has you beating hordes after hordes of unique looking enemies, with a very wide set of weapons, abilities and items for any fight style you want, acompaning the fights with narration to further the story and previous events, and allowing to explore the beutifuly made levels for secret items.Even though the game is focused on the story campaing, the gameplay is so addictive it will have you replaying it over and over to find more secrets, unlock prizes, new dificulties and beating special and very challenging levels that will demand you to master the combat skills.This game is worth every single pennie, and I sugest getting the soundtrack just as much.

												Bastion is beautiful. not only does it have great combat and story, but also ( most importantly) Morgan Freeman narrates it. ( well, it sounds like it at least) All of the wepons seem fluid and fit well, so there's no laser swords or shark launchers, just good ol' hammers, macchetes, and the occasional pistol. You can upgrade your inventory, which is very useful. And aso, this game os very hard, which  i love! The only thing i regret is not playing it alot. PEACE!			",165,27,3,14,11,1,3

												Admittedly, I missed the Bastion hype train when it came chugging past in 2011 and had only ever heard of a brief description of it being 'good' from people around me. How I missed that goodness knows but after playing Bastion I can only say that it completely lives up to the hype around it.In an action RPG hack and slasher, you play as a character simply called The Kid. What unfolds is a story where there is no 'good' or 'bad' but instead a morally grey area for a majority of the characters which leads to some interesting perspectives. The story is told by the narrator who comments and narrates almost everything you do as The Kid. Perhaps people can see this as being a gimmick for the game but I personally found it delightfully charming and enjoyed listening to the commentary as I played. It helps to try the story forward and serves as encouragement if you should get stuck to keep going. The only gripe I have about the story is that I would've liked to have a bit more of it, plus one of the decisions that you're forced to choose at the end doesn't seem to have much of an effect on the end story.Graphically the game is stunning, even living up to the standards of 2014. Seeing the ground rise up around my character as I walked was stunning and helped to keep the pace of the game. Every area has been designed carefully so there's a lot to see and do in a story that is around 5 hours long. The foes you come up against have all had thought put into them and both move and look as I'd imagined.Gameplay-wise the game is clever as it has an almost 'choose your own difficulty' with the shrine settings. By activating more idols  you gain bigger rewards but this in turn makes the game much more difficult. The use of the distillery also allows the player themselves to choose what bonuses they gain from levelling up making it so The Kid is completely customised to the player. The same goes with weapons; a range of melee and ranged weapons drop throughout the game which once again allows the player to play at their preferred style. This isn't something I'm used to seeing in games and it added to my enjoyment.As for the soundtrack... it's honestly one of my favourite soundtracks and I'm someone who doesn't download soundtracks too much. It fits the mood of the game perfectly and  helps to immerse you straight into the world of Bastion. There's not much else I can say but I can guarantee that at the very least you should be able to fall in love with the soundtrack even if the game isn't for yourself.The replay factor varies. I'm not the sort of person who'd play a game more than once yet I found myself playing Bastion for the second time through with the new gamemode I'd unlocked. As it allows you to carry over your stats and weapons from your previous save it makes the game a lot easier which some people may dislike but I enjoyed immensely. The game isn't so long that replaying it feels tedious either!Ultimately I ended up being surprised that this game was made by an indie developer as it's so polished and such a beautiful, engaging game. There's not much I can fault other than one slight disgruntlement with the storyline to be honest. This comes highly recommended if there's anyone else who hasn't played it, even when it's not on sale. If it's on sale... well, there's no excuse to not buy Bastion.			",16,12,0,10,11,0,0

												A tremendous, perhaps even startling achievement, ""Bastion"" is everything great in gaming.It starts with a tremendously accessible and altogether fluid control system that works beautifully on PC. It adds to that a number of ""micro-customizations"" that let you nudge the core mechanics towards your favored playstyle. These micro-customizations take the form of weapons, weapon upgrades, ""spirits"" that act as passive skills, and shrine idols that make things tougher.On top of that, the game places very nicely crafted art. ""Bastion's"" visual stylings are highly distinctive, fun to look at, and also completely functional as a gameplay element.The final layer is a wrenching, yet never overdone or melodramatic story. There are very rich, mysterious elements that get woven in to fire up your imagination, and those elements are given with the same sensitivity and subtlety as the character arcs. The story is told almost entirely through gameplay, which keeps the narrative entirely connected to what's going on....and that soundtrack. Goodness gracious, that soundtrack. A person could buy this game for the sole purpose of listening to it. The music is superb (especially the main theme and the blues/ Americana tinged tracks) and the narrator could read a phone book without becoming tiresome.As far as I can tell, ""Bastion"" is flawless.

												*whistles a catchy tune from Bastion*It could be any one of the beautiful songs from the soundtrack. ONE of them will stick in your head when you play this. If you're unlucky, more than one song will stick AND YOU WILL LOVE EVERY MINUTE OF IT....and if you thought the music was catchy, the gameplay and graphics will leave you wanting more. And if you play for the stories... well, you're going to love it. The combat can be adjusted so anybody can play it happily.You want to play for the story? The No-Sweat mode will take the combat right down to the minimum. (My choice!)You feel the urge to go a-la- Dark Souls? Normal mode with all shrines invoked will cause your character to die every few minutes unless you're a pro. (Don't say I didn't warn you!)The graphics are cute, but never overly so. And no matter how cute the enemies, you WILL know they're enemies. No worries about bits of the background suddenly turning out to be a deadly boss without due warning. Only gripe in the whole game - one or two bits of scenery looked safe to walk on, even though they weren't.tl;dr - BUY THIS, YOU WILL PROBABLY LOVE THIS FOR SOME REASON. STORY, GRAPHICS, SOUNDTRACK, GAMEPLAY, OR THE WHOLE THING. YOU WILL LOVE IT FOR SOMETHING.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												     I really don't like games where the player or character that you play is tiny and right in the middle of the screen.. But this was - a masterpiece.      The story was breath-taking and really special in its own way. It had many twists and turns that made it even better. Its also pretty fun that you can invoke and idols to make the game more difficult instead of just choosing a mode to play in. All the characters have really unique personalities and histories - which ultimately makes the game even more exciting! Really loved how there are so many weapons and upgrades that you can get to make the Kid better at fighting! (Best weapons I've ever had to use in games)     Bastion's art was fanstastic. The style was very original and cute. The environment was carefully planned as each 'world' or location had character and history. Personally I loved Tazal Terminals and the Bastion :)     Its OST was one of the most unique OSTs I've ever (Soz, can't beat BioShock Infinite's OST - Elizabeth) heard. I really enjoyed how the voice actors got to sing a single song as a theme for each of their characters.Overall, it was one of the best games I played for 2014~! :D:D:D 10/10 because everything XDDPs.

There's a short pro/con list at the end of this review, if you don't feel like reading this whole bunch of text.ReviewBastion is one of those games you just have to fall in love with 'cause it's incredibly intriguing from the very beginning.The story takes place in the fictional city of Caelondia and its surroundings, now fractured because of a catastrophe called the Calamity. The Calamity broke the world apart and turned nearly all its inhabitants to ash. Now, the pieces of this world float in the sky, and the Kid (the protagonist of the game) awakens on one of these pieces. He sets out to reach the Bastion, a place said to be safe in times of trouble.One of the many things I love about Bastion is how you build the world around you by exploring it. Your path forms in front of you as you fight your way through enemies and investigate the area. This, as well as the use of vivid colors, make the world feel very lively, despite the destruction the Calamity has brought upon Caelondia.Also, the soundtrack is amazing. Seriously, buy it, it's gold.Bastion is labeled as an action role-playing game, but I would specify that and call it a hack-and-slay game because of its focus on combat and variety of weapons (you're welcome to disagree with that point, but I think genres to be quite squishy anyway; Bastion just feels more like a hack-and-slay game to me). There we have another thing I love about this game: you can choose from plenty of weapons and combine them any way you want.There are 11 unique items, either melee or ranged weapons, and you can carry two at once. By default, you equip one melee and one ranged weapon, but you can replace them anytime at the Armory. You want to carry two melee weapons, for example your trusty Cael Hammer AND the War Machete? No problem. Two ranged weapons, let's say, the Scrap Musket in combination with the Breaker's Bow? Why not?The third equipment slot is reserved for Secret Skills you find, win, or buy later in the game.There are many more possibilities to customize your character, for example Spirits providing passive bonuses; let's just say, you can choose equipment from a REALLY great range of thingies.My favorite thing about Bastion, though, is the narrative style. The Kid himself is silent throughout the whole game, but there is a narrator whose voice accompanies the protagonist, providing the player with background information and reacting to what he or she chooses to do.The voice is so incredibly great; really calm but rough at the same time. It feels like it belongs to an older, experienced man who grew a little tired of all the stuff happening around him after years of turmoil - and I think that is perfect. You get the feeling that you're hanging out in a pub, and you meet an aged man who tells you stories about his life as a young adventurer. This may be the greatest thing about Bastion - that you feel like you get to know the narrator, like he personally speaks to you and no one else.All in all, I think Bastion might be one of the most beautiful games set in a post-apocalyptic world I've ever played. The art style and soundtrack go so well with the atmosphere, and the narrative style is breathtaking. The gameplay is really fun and allows for a lot of customization. I already recommend it to anyone who's into video games, and I don't think you would regret playing it.Short list for everyone who's too lazy to read this:• multiple endings• playtime (first run, didn't finish 100 % of the game) approx. 11 hoursPros:+ beautiful graphics+ amazing soundtrack+ 11 unique weapons (melee as well as ranged weapons), all upgradeable+ high customizability (e.g. weapons, Spirits, etc.)+ extraordinary narrative style+ stunning voice acting+ collectibles and side quests/challenges (e.g. mementos, proving grounds for each weapon, vigils)+ great control over difficulty level (you can activate up to 10 Idols, each making enemies stronger in some way and rewarding you with more XP and fragments in return; great system in my opinion)Cons:- New Game+ Mode doesn't offer anything too special			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												8/10 - Beautiful game (visually as well as gameplay), really enjoyed it.- Easy in overall difficulty with options to increase difficulty for bonus exp rewards (which can make it quite challenging)- Plenty of balanced weapons that fit vastly different play stylesOne complaint I do have about the game is the way that new weapons and skills are introduced: you receive new weapons in an un-upgraded form and are forced to play with a seemingly under-powered weapon.  After a hard time during the level due to the new weapon, you probably won't take it out for another spin.  This creates a bias for the starting weapons unless you really like to experiment.

												Originally, I couldn't imagine what the hype about Bastion was or even could be. After the demo alone I became acutely aware of just how amazing a game Bastion is. Not the longest of games, Bastion is neverthless more than good enough to compensate for this- especially with it's new game plus.And while it's typically the narrator that brings in buyers, for me it'd have to be the large selection of weapons for the player. Few action RPGs pack as diverse and fun a set of weapons as Bastion does.			",260,76,4,47,18,0,48

												Bastion is a amazing game developed by Supergiants Games. The Story is quite short but there is plenty to do in this game such as the Proving Grounds to hone your skills with disverse weaponry. The music and artstyle is fanstastic, and there are many different ways to play as your character. I recommend			",150,28,0,27,22,0,18

I know I have a bit of a weakness for hand-drawn graphics, but the soundtrack is absolutely beautiful too and the story itself is better still. Add to that its various weapons, upgrades, environments, enemies, a separate challenge for each weapon... I'll stop before I go on for too long. But I definitely recommend this game.

												Bastion is a beautifully crafted game, from the soundtrack to the characters, the art style to the story. Post-apocalyptic has rarely been done with such a fresh, invigorating tone. The combat system is real-time, and rather engaging, with upgrades to a variety of weapons that allow any gamer to really find her or his style. With controller-compatibility, the gameplay becomes even more fluid and enjoyable. I have nothing but praise for this game. It is really worth the money!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Phenomenally atmospheric game with solid gameplay. The story is engaging from the start and progress is natural as there is never a pause in storytelling nor a time you have to grind to advance. I played this with a gamepad and I'm unsure if I would like it as much if I used my keyboard; the fluidity gamepad allows seems better suited to this game, especially on higher difficulties. From the ground up this game seems polished; the artstyle, the combat, the soundtrack, the gear and skill progression, the voice-acting, the story... It was a great ride and leaves me looking forward to Supergiant's future ventures. [10/10]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bastion, a game where visual wonder and narrating marvels come together. When I first saw this game I had never heard of the developer SuperGiant and honestly as a personal introduction into the Indie community I could not have asked for much more. As soon as I got to the end of the game, I soon found that this game stood apart from all others I had ever played before. And this game has even more to offer after one playthrough. For starters, the soundtrack is simply superb and is fantastic to listen to. Not to mention how fulfilling it is to get all of the achievements afterwards and finding the secret easter eggs. It is independently and wholly its own game a TRUE masterpiece of Indie games and all games alike. I highly recommend this game to anyone who feels that they need to play a good game.To be short Bastion is a stand alone masterpiece and after playing you cannot help but to fall in love with this title and the developers.

												Wake up on a floating rock to find the world has been struck with calamity. A fun little rpg style game has you finishing small levels to rebuild the bastion. With a very appeasing artstyle and an amazing soundtrack that sets a great mood and theme. The narrator brings some comedy to the experience explaining the story as you go along and speaks along to your actions in-game. While it is rather short it is very fun and if you wish to continue you can play new game+ with all your equipment and choose the other endings. 8/10			",243,24,7,26,22,4,40

												I really enjoyed this one: the artwork is really beautiful (though the graphics are isometric, which means you're gonna fall a few times off the gorgeous watercolored landscapes, just be warned), the soundtrack is impressive and the narrator that guides you and keeps you company through the game is a tough-but-charming dude you would want to meet in real life.The main plot could seem kinda thin because you spend most of the time fighting cute critters while the narrator makes nostalgic comments about the way the world used to be before the Calamity, but oddly enough they managed to build a emotional story with an amazing ending despite all the time you spend killing things with a machete and a cannon.Actually I was expecting to like this game just because of the artwork and the apocalyptic storyline, but I was quite happy to discover that there're a lot of fun weapons and special attacks you can combine to try different battle styles in the challenging arenas. So a wonderful game all around.Make yourself a favour and buy it :D			",34,29,0,11,2,1,3

I'd say the music was half of the enjoyment.Lots of abilities and customizations to unlock, so you can choose your play style - melee, guns, arrows, etc.The combat gets a little bit repetitive, and it's actually really easy. This is nice for people who don't like to rage, but I felt a little like I was just sort of walking through the story with how easy it was -- you can up the difficulty though, so that's fixable.The story didn't really captivate me. I'm not sure why, it just wasn't very deep, so I didn't really come to care for/about the characters at all. There was one moment I felt moved, and that was at the ending, so at least it ends on a poignant note.			",206,117,4,32,28,3,22

												The soundtrack! Just the soundtrack! It's possibly the best thing about this game. I have spent a good time just in the main menu listening to that guitar track.The world of Bastion is a wonderful world, there is nothing like it that I know of. All the little things like the skyway travel system in the hub or the fact you don't just have ""Special abilities"" you have black tonics. The Bastion itself and the characters are just wonderful and add to the world. The artistic design of the whole world is very different but also very good such as how the floor appears and builds itself underneath you as you walk. The game itself is not a massive graphically demanding shiney game like Crysis but it still looks lovely due to the art and aesthetic.The combat is kind of simple but is fine tuned and very skilful. You rely on your skill in fighting and dodging to win, just spamming the attack button won't work. The upgrades is very much the same, it's simple but effective. None of the weapons become over powered by any upgrades, they are merely just your personal play style. Do you want to use the great big two handed Cael Hammer or use the fast shooting and nimble Fanged Repeater?The story is a bit grim, taking place after what is just called ""The Calamity"" which you are slowly fed information about along with the rest of the background story but it is done so well. This is due to the narrator who is possibly the best voiced and best paced narrator I have ever heard besides maybe Thomas Was Alone. It is done so well i would recommend the game purely for that. But thankfully Bastion is great is every regard and so i can recommend it for everything. Which I do.			",219,25,2,22,43,4,64

												This game is simply brilliant. Amazing. I have never played a game that is as good as this one. For only about 4 dollars you can get this game with the soundtrack. The gameplay is nice, an rpg style combat.The weapons are awesome, you can absolutely wreck enemies in this game with the right combinations of weapons and secret skills. You don't raise your stats by leveling up, instead you drink spirits in the Distillery which give you certain boosts and abilities. In the beginning you start with 1 slot but as you level up, the number increases. It's a good game mechanic imo to change what you usually do in rpgs. The story is really great. I won't say anything about it other than its great.The narrator does an awesome job of telling the story as the game goes on. Another one of the best things about this game is its soundtrack. Absolutely beautiful. I can't describe much on how good it is. If you're going to get this game please get the soundtrack too. You just need to. It's an obligation. In my opinion this games does a good job at what it does. It's one of my favorite games. If you're looking for a great time, pick this game up. I MUST recommend this to you.			",199,24,1,19,4,0,9

												The game itself seems like it would have been done before, but the difference is in the pacing and visibly the art. The game feels amazing as every attack, hit, and evade your character does is important to the way you want to play. And speaking of playing, the different weapons in the game offer outstanding gameplay changes. You want to be able to run up to some one and slash as fast as you can? Sure, pick the machete. You want to smash stuff doing tuns of damage in as few hits as possible? Got your big♥♥♥♥♥hammer right here. I don't think I need to go into how good the narration and soundtrack is. A really good experience overall. Worth the 14.99 (at the current moment of this post). Pick it up whenever you feel like all your other games are stale.			",130,16,2,10,6,0,2

It may not be everyones cup of tea, but for £11 or so, it is worth getting, even if you find you don't like it.			",88,12,0,8,7,0,13

												Bastion is a great game with a story and action RPG elements. At first, my interest level in this game was quite low--even while playing, but once you start to unlock different ugprades/perks you really start to enjoy this game. If you're playing this game for achievements, prepare to play this game roughly 2-3 times from start to finish with one of those playthroughs being end-game grindy. I wouldn't say the achievements were necessarily fun, but at least the game made it so I wasn't tearing my hair out. A small tip for those wanting to get 100% achievements: First play through unlock all that is possible in normal mode. The next two playthroughs, you can literally speed run through the stages ignoring all enemies and items as the remaining achievements have nothing to do with them. xD.			",108,29,0,23,8,0,5

												9.5/10Brilliant game. While I had a hard time understanding enough of the story on the first go around to really appreciate it, a quick googling of characters and major themes helps you understand some of the very strong poetic and moral messages of the game, which, once all the pieces of the plot came together, really was powerful.It played like a good book or piece of art: everyone has their own meaning attached to the events of the game, and it makes you re-evaluate your place in the world and assumptions on how life should operate. When you finish, the game will have meaning for you.It's truly a spectacular game. Gameplay can get a little route (though difficulty is adjustable), but that's not really the point, it's all about the story.			",126,47,4,11,18,4,12

												Bastion is one of the last Xbox Live Arcade games I missed in my Steam library. While this is not the best, nor my favorite indie game, it is still a wonderful game that everyone should try out.The story is told by The Stranger who is telling the whole story through very well-written narration with a cool voice. That is in fact one of the major good things of this game.The graphics, while not the most beautiful of indie games, have a nice style and the idea of raising pieces of land makes for some quite nice visuals.As previously mentioned, the narration is wonderful and the music is really good too. The gameplay is quite simple but really fun and at times challenging. The whole game is played in a top-down isometric perspective and the main focus is one finding a certain object (for example, a core) while fighting your way through waves of enemies. It all works well and I haven't ecountered a single glitch. You'll get to use several different weapons, both melee and long-range.Aside from the main story, there's quite a lot to do on the side. Every weapon has trial/challenge area and later in the game you'll get to visit optional areas (a kind of a battle arena). After beating the game, you also unlock New Game Plus and Score Attack Mode so you might wanna complete the game a few times. With all that in mind: the game has quite a big longetivity and replay value.SCORE: 8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a short game, probably less than 10 hours, and you can finish the story in a night.  This is not a lot of time to sell the player on a character, much less a whole bespoke world. Fortunately, the game is engaging and unrelated enough to the story that you can enjoy it, while its obscure story flows around you. By its end, though, you will find yourself invested, and actually caring about this world you're living in.Because, here's the thing: This game is just so damn beautiful. Its music, its art, its story... creates a story-book atmosphere that -- I'm not kidding, here -- touches the soul. Yes, I think you should play this game.  The game, by the way, supports a mode that allows you to experience the world somewhat safely, which makes the game easy for anyone to experience and enjoy.			",157,20,3,19,15,0,27

The soundtrack is great; even though the entire game can be played in a solid day, there's a different track for each level. I'd rate it a good 8.5 out of 10, only because this game seemed like it ended so fast. Betrayal, hope, all that good stuff. I'd buy it even if it wasn't on sale.			",106,10,3,11,21,0,19

												Bastion is one of the most stunning games I have ever played. The art is utterly beautiful and the colors are so well used that you feel like you're going through a fairy tale pop-up book. The combat is really fun and it's incredibly hard when you have all Idols active. You have lots of combinations of weapons, so it'll be difficult to get bored from the same gameplay every time. The trials can be very tricky, but after you complete them it's very rewarding. The story is narrated in a way that you can't help but pay attention to it. Not that it is a problem, because it's a beautiful story and you'll have the choice of how you want to end it, which is a big difficult decision to make. The Soundtrack is also amazing, I'd recommend getting it as well if you love video games music.I can't recommend this game enough, if it's on sale don't even think twice before getting it!

The level design, while more robust tan Transitors consistant color scheme, I kept falling off the edges of the map because it was not always clear what was floor and what wasn't...That aside, Bastion is an amazing game with not only an amazing story, but characters that have a surprising level of depth, an amazing soundtrack, and art style that blew me away withi each new area.

												Just know, I have out time into this offline, on my X-Box, and PS3! I have alot more experiance then the time it says I have put in.     Bastion is a game of story. The game is a almost 3D-isometric-ish hack and slash. There are alot of wepons, abilities, sidequests, options, and so much more. The controls are sweet too!   You wake up as a character called ""The Kid""( as most characters are only referred to as The ????). After making your way throught the first level you learn a little about the story through The Narrarator. The world is expanded upon much more the there are a even a few tear jerking moments in there You can find several relics to give to people you will start pooling to the hub to learn more about the lore of The KId and the mythical world of his.   There are many wepons and abilities, as I have said. All wepons are found throughout the story along with some abilites. No wepons are missable. Stores in the hub(we'll get to that) can sell permant equipments(Spirits) and upgrades for your kicking wepons(assuming you have obtained the ingredients).   The game is traversed through the hub, the Bastion. The skyways(teleporters) can shoot you to missions or extra stages. Most of the time the game gives you several levels to choose from, although you have to complete them all, just in any order.  In the earlier mentioned extra stages you can play challenges based on one wepon. You can win money, a upgrade ingredient and a specilzed ability for that wepon.  Completing the story will allow you to upgrade the hub with stores. These range from the shrine for sidequests, to the Lost and Found to buy missed ingrediants and relics(even though you can backtrack), along with some uniqe spirits and abilites.  The story (and action) is complimented by  the awesome soundtrack, it can pump you up, get you down,♥♥♥♥♥♥you off, anything!If you didn't get the message, buy this game!			",86,26,1,21,23,0,17

												For Gamers who appreciate game design as Art. One of the few games I find myself coming back to again and again for the rich  environments and character development, as well as the music. The story and its characters all benefit from a very well crafted method of exposition, with equal parts pathos, humour, mystery and humanity. The gameplay is solid, with a very customizable play styles. Unique perks, upgrades, skills and buffs along with their drawbacks will ensure that whatever the player chooses to specialize in, he will never be short a challenge. The ""Who Knows Where"" sections of the game offer a way for the player to increase his skill and his reaction time with the controls by steadily pitting the player against progressively larger waves of enemies, all the while encouraging effort through the delivery of backstory for the characters in the game.

												Amazing. The 'Hack n Slash' tag doesnt suit a game with this much Depth. Most RPGs have different weapons, but more like an upgrade as you progress. But these weapons are purely on what your style is. Ive seen people ace with weapons i didnt even consider. And i feel it hard and unnatural to switch. Beauty in my opinion.Amazing music. Makes you want to buy the soundtrack. Art style was different, but Perfect.Narration is really cool. Never found it too distracting or corny, etc. Not something you see anywhere else.The story and the dynamics too were very complex and especially the ending makes you think. Alltogether, This was the best game i never expected anything from.I did feel this would be better with a controller just for the movement directions, doesnt come in the way of gameplay though.

												Bastion's art-style looks really great and adds a lot to the feel of the game. The story is mostly shown to the player through the gameplay and environment rather than told in dialogue or text. This makes the story seem more interesting than it perhaps actually is. My favourite feature of Bastion is that as you make your way through the world, the story and landscape are described by a man who has the voice of an old, western heavy smoker. This constant commentary, whilst mostly ineffectual, really adds a lot to the game and makes discovering each new area and enemy that much more enjoyable. The combat is fairly basic and very similar to other isometric hack & slashers and the game can be finished in just a few hours but I think that if it were longer it might out-stay it's welcome. Bastion is a great game and often appears in the steam sales so it is definitely worth picking up.			",278,80,4,20,19,1,23

												I picked this up long ago and through a humble Bundle package, I had played it with the classic mouse / keyboard combination for a while but found it cumbersome. Though the directional keys allow you to navigate the maps decently, some aim and movement features in the game are just best done with an analog stick.The game throws a plethora of weapon choices your way, from the usefull through the tactical up to the absurd; there's something for everybody here.This game is defined by the soundtrack, that alone kept me playing.The ending has impact, the replay mode gives you more freedom and the abillity to toughen up the enemies even more and the announcer is, semi-aware something fishy is going on. To go further into this would do the game a disservice.Great game, best played with a controller; sadly no native XInput support, though x360ce does the job well.			",56,3,1,6,3,0,5

The story was uterlly confusing and I didn't care about it at all, so choosing an ending was empty and pointless.  The combat felt ok...nothing to write home about.  I settled on a setup that felt the strongest and stuck with it the entire game.  I wasn't compelled do another playthrough. I'm glad I finally finished it and it left a memorable mark.

												Played the game before, never got around to actually finishing till now.  Because of this I must rewrite my review:Bastion is an RPG that stands out from many other RPGs out there.  The path lays themselves down as you walk on them and the game itself is an art.  Fighting system is also not too complex but still offers various options for loadout and passive skills.  If the game is too easy, you can add additional challenges by invoking one (or all) of the ten gods available.  The narrator is one of the game's unique feature as he narrates everything you do - including your dumb mistakes.  But the best part of the game is the story itself.  You start the game knowing nothing about yourself or the world or anyone.  But in time, the story will come together like a puzzle and the ending is definitely worth playing for.  In my opinion, it's one of the best endings I've seen.  It's not a long game - I finished it in 12 hours (and I took my sweet time).TL;DR: PLAY IT!Tip: if you have a controller, use it!  This game is so much better with a controller, in my opinion.			",72,36,0,12,15,2,14

												Deserving of the all the critical acclaim it recieves! The soundtrack, narration, story and hand drawn art are all beautiful. A uniquely atmospheric game that draws you into the game world of this Hack and Slash RPG similar to Diablo 2 and Torchlight.The gameplay can be somewhat frustrating at the start (falling off ledges) but hang in there until you have some upgrades to your favorite weapons + Leechaid and you'll have a blast. The  imagination that went into the weapons, creatures, enviroment - everything - is awe inspiring.Tips - 1. Make sure to upgrade the Tonic Distillery until LeechAid is available and equip it as soon as possible - it heals you when you hurt enemies.2. The Army Carbine rifle is weak to start, but upgrade it to Explosive Bullets with faster charging times and it destroys most enemies in 1 - 2 shots.3. Don't be frustrated with the Proving Grounds' first prizes - you need to upgrade your weapon a few times to win First Prize usually.			",818,250,10,84,59,4,115

												This game is absolutely beautiful.  The gameplay is fairly repetitive, so it may not be a game you can sit a play for hours on end, but it is still a ton of fun, and the soundtrack is great.  The slow-paced story telling may bother some people, but I found it just made me want to keep playing to hear the next part.  It is well worth the price, but if it happens to be on sale, pick it up for sure.			",25,1,0,8,1,0,2

												By the end of this game I have to admit, I was getting a little tired of the gameplay. It wasn't necessarily boring because the game steadily throws new weapons and enemies at you which you have to work your head around. But by the end, I was mostly looking forward to not having to see another one of those green eyed thorn balls. I've never been a big fan of dungeon crawlers, so maybe it's a point in Bastion's favour that it was able to keep me interested for so long despite my mixed feelings towards the gameplay.The artwork is definitely the highlight of the game. The landscapes are bring and colourful, and it's a plearsure to meaner your way throught them. The sound is great, with parts of the landscape giving a satisfying ""cruch"" when they're destroyed. And the voice acting... oh man. Rucks is the narrator/guide through your adventure. He is well written, and his rusty voice gives the game a lot of character. Buy the Bastion announcer pack in Dota 2 if you want more.Overall, it's a good game. I won't be playing it over, but it was overall an enjoyable game while it lasted. I'll be looking forward to playing Transistor next.			",74,6,4,5,7,0,12

												""Proper story 'sposed to start at the beginning. This one ain't so simple""Bastion's brilliance is in the way it's story is told; through dynamic narration. As you fight to rebuild the world following ""The Calamity"" your actions, choices, and even style of play are accompanied by only some of the thousands of lines of dialouge that tell the tale without ever taking you out of the moment. The gameplay is perfectly balanced for customization and is the closest thing I've seen to a good ol' fashioned Super Nintendo title since it's heyday. It also features one of the greatest soundtracks ever produced. Bastion would be an accomplishment for a large studio, but for the independant artists at Supergiant it is so much more - It is everything right about modern gaming.			",172,37,4,19,8,0,12

												The Kid did good. First he heard rumors about just how awesome Bastion was during its Xbox live run. Then it came to steam and he played the Demo. Wielding two weapons at once, he plowed his way though the first level of an entertaining hack-n-slash game where he heard me, the narrator, narrate his every action for sometimes humorous effect as the plot unfolds. Purchasing it during a Steam Sale, he continued onward past the demo level where he found the world map filled with challenge levels and missions as he collected the cores and shards to rebuild Bastion. He just couldn't get enough of it.The Kid was impressed, and so was I. Even after he completed the story, I was pleasantly surprised at how even NewGame+ was worked into the game even if I found the act of making choices near the end rather arbitrary. A shame that the Kid didn't know how to strongly recommend the game. On a part that he's that strong silent type. But that's okay. As I can do it for him.Strongly Recommended!

												Cool levels, and there's good variation in their artwork themes, but they are very linear. I liked the enemies a lot, there are a load of different enemies with unique and funny designs, and cool and varied attacks. A con about the combat is that you have no choice in how to engage an enemy by choosing different paths to different situations, but there is in the weapon choice. There's a big amount of weapons, and they are varied, but I feel like they just got stronger the further in the game, so that there's really not much reason to pick a bow over carbine. Lastly, the sound-effects were varied and the voice-acting and the soundtrack was absolutely stunning. The creative story-telling with an omniscient narrator and the sounds and voices truly elevate this game above mediocrity.8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fight to restore the bastion to its former self... or not.This is a great little game worth its price, which is best enjoyed in short bursts of gameplay, half hour here and there. 1 playthrough ( for me ) rounded out to be a bit over 4 hours, but due to some unlocks and decision making towards the end of the game, it easily offers more than one playthrough. ( which is more than what i can say for other, cash cow, $60 games... )The narration itself really made this game stand out to me, story-telling with a twist, and quite the.. attractive voice. which is pretty much icing on the cake. ( but hey if you dont like it, you can turn it off. dont let it deture you from the game, but it certainly is quite a big part of the game itself. )There are also the occasional catchy tune that pops up from time to time, which really helps set the mood for the levels as well. thinking of getting the album, truthfully. if you like a game to kick back too, deff give this a look			",85,20,4,9,11,0,6

												I didn't really enjoy this game, but I don't entirely fault it for that.I think it's a pretty unique isometric ARPG in terms of artstyle and theme. It's beautiful, colorful, and whimsical, and that makes it quite lovely. Once you learn the controls, they are fairly simple, and the game doesn't burden you with endless weapon choices - it only has a few that are each significantly different from one another.However, I felt like this game does tutorialization pretty poorly.So, if you're already familiar with similar isometric ARPGs, and if you enjoy them, I think this is likely to be a good pick.

												Where do I start with this game....?I will probably be just another person telling you to buy this game but seriously you should and I will tell you why.Lets start with the graphics....the aesthetic of Bastion is beautiful, colorful, and full of taste. Not only will Bastion's graphics hold up over time for years to come, not only should the gamer enjoy the aesthetic but the team at Supergiant Games should be proud of them. Some Gamers may disagree about the games graphics but what they can't do is ignore the amount of time, expression, and hard work that has gone into creating the world of Bastion.Gameplay remains to be the very core of all video games made. In this department Bastion shines with wonderful action and tones of a role playing game. Bastion will control a lot like a normal game using the WASD for movement and left/right clicking for attacks. Bastion also introduces other key strokes for abilities that make the gameplay not only fun but strategic on how to tackle your enemy. By introducing new weapons with different play styles Bastion remains fresh in changing it up not too often but just enough to give the player a taste of what a new weapon is and how to use it.Story....Where do I begin with this.....I have been playing games for a little over 20 years and can't recall off the top of my head a game that tells an amazing story in 3rd person in such a successful way as Bastion. I was not expecting this going into the game nor did I find it odd that the main character never has a voice out loud. The decisions you make will reflect the outcome of the game with a story powerful and demanding of me to finish my first playthrough within 2 days of starting! The game length is just long enough to enjoy and sink yourself into the world but not long enough to exclude the casual gamer or multiple playthroughs. Overall I had a great time with Bastion, if anyone asks me for a recommendation or directly asks me about Bastion I would not hesitate to offer my opinion. Supergiant Games you really outdid yourself on Bastion and have gained a loyal fan to the games you create. I hope to see more from this developer in the future of gaming.

												Everyone already knows how great this game is, so I'm obviously going over familiar ground here, but if for some godforsaken reason you don't already own Bastion, fix that immediately!As an action game, Bastion not breaking new ground by any stretch.  It's a pretty simple little overhead beatemup that has you completing story and challenge missions in order to build up your hub, which in turn provides increased weapon variety and various RPG lite upgrade paths.  The gameplay isn't groundbreaking but it is certainly adequate.  The controls are tight and the weapons feel right.  There is also certain amount of tactical variety in terms of how you can deal with a given encounter, which provides both an incentive to upgrade different paths and an incentive to replay the game down the road.Where Bastion shines of course, is the atmostphere.  The main character, The Kid, has his story narrated by an incredible voice actor, and as you play through it you development an attachment to The Kid as well as to the characters around him.  There isn't a ton of depth in the story, but it is presented well, giving glimpses of the world that has broken apart, and when you have to finally make some tough choices later in the game, the existing emotional investment actually gives weight to those choices.The music / sound and art are also wonderful.As I said though, none of this is new. You probably already own this.  If you haven't played it, do.  If you don't, buy it, and do.Controller required though.			",1417,618,38,197,139,16,219

												It's impossible not to like this game. Nice story told in a really cool way by the narrator, cool game mechanics, amazing music (worth purchasing the soundtrack separately) and absolutely gorgeous artwork. It does not feel like it's a first ever game by a studio. Highly recommended.			",63,20,3,6,2,0,7

												Why have I not recommended this yet?  Well, you get a crappy rec because it's NaNo month and I'm supposed to be writing about things that aren't Bastion.Okay, Bastion is amazing.  The art direction is beautiful, the music is exactly what it needs to be and more for every scenario and atmosphere in the game (I put it on a CD for driving, actually), the gameplay is simple and appealing, yet deep, and certainly not easy enough to disappoint.  Last, but most definitely not least, is the narrator.  The narrator narrates, tells the story, and commentates on everything you do.  This is a story about death, remorse, solitude, nostalgia, life, and hope that's told as you play it.  Get it.			",240,249,1,33,23,2,14

												Played the game before, never got around to actually finishing till now.  Because of this I must rewrite my review:Bastion is an RPG that stands out from many other RPGs out there.  The path lays themselves down as you walk on them and the game itself is an art.  Fighting system is also not too complex but still offers various options for loadout and passive skills.  If the game is too easy, you can add additional challenges by invoking one (or all) of the ten gods available.  The narrator is one of the game's unique feature as he narrates everything you do - including your dumb mistakes.  But the best part of the game is the story itself.  You start the game knowing nothing about yourself or the world or anyone.  But in time, the story will come together like a puzzle and the ending is definitely worth playing for.  In my opinion, it's one of the best endings I've seen.  It's not a long game - I finished it in 12 hours (and I took my sweet time).TL;DR: PLAY IT!Tip: if you have a controller, use it!  This game is so much better with a controller, in my opinion.			",72,36,0,12,15,2,14

												Talking about the gameplay of this game is probably the easiest part:You have two weapons that you can choose from a pool of up to 12 (or something). New weapons get introduced regularly up to and including the final level. With the left and right mouse buttons you shoot, slash, smash, stab and/or pistol-sling things until they are dead. There are many different things to kill, which keeps up the variety nicely, and being able to dodge-roll like crazy keeps a steady and exciting pace.There are minor gripes (such as the lock-on being a bit imprecise at some points), but nothing even remotely gamebreaking.I may sound dismissive, but this is only because the hack'n'slash gameplay is merely good - compared to a narrative which is absolutely excellent.Bastion puts you into the shoes of The Kid, a tough lone survivor of an almost world-ending catastrophe called The Calamity. He quickly finds his way to a safe haven called The Bastion, but is disappointed to find only one survivor - Rucks, who is also the narrator of this game. Now you might have heard how this game has a ""dynamic narrator"" and the way it's been marketed is slightly less than truthful - the vast majority of the narrator's lines are scripted and occur at fixed points in the narrative. This doesn't matter one bit though, because there are many, many such lines and Logan Cunningham as Rucks manages to get every single one of them to work. This narrator is sometimes funny as hell, sometimes tough and cool, sometimes sad and wistful, sometimes something else entirely... but it works. It sucks you right into the world and doesn't let you go until you have heard the last of his incredibly well-written comments.To me, the narrator alone is a unique and overwhelming selling point, but that is not to say that this is the only way the narrative and the art of this game will charm you. Caelondia, the main setting of this game, is (as the above screenshots will verify) a colorful and beautiful and interesting and varied place. The range of levels (and related moods and tones and gameplay changes) is huge, though the way new locations keep getting introduced and then forgotten after a short visit may remind you of an overambitious sightseer with an overstuffed travel schedule.The music is excellent, moody and serene and exciting as the situation demands. Special mention should be reserved for two absolutely beautiful guitar-and-voice pieces that I won't spoil. Let me just say that they fit into the plot and have a lot more going for them than you would understand on a superficial hearing.Finally, I have to give the gameplay some more credit. That is, the way it merges at times with the plot to create... art.Sorry, that sounded horribly pretentious, but it really is the only word I can find for it. Supergiant Games have somehow managed to make the simplistic and violent mechanics of hack'n'slash appear meaningful in a story about loss and recovery, desperation and hope.... god damn it, there comes the pretension again.Let me just finish this paragraph by saying that one possible endgame scenario is the capital B Best synergy of engaging gameplay and poignant storytelling that I have ever seen or could ever imagine.In closing, Bastion remains one of my favorite games of all times. This is very much an ""art"" game in the sense that you get the feeling the people working on it wanted to make something beautiful and something that really resonates with people. And they succeeded. As a little extra, I'd like to note that the narrator has an unique comment for every possible combination of weapons. Sometimes it adds a little extra texture to the world, sometimes commenting on the style of fighting it implies. Wow. (All possible combinations of two weapons from a pool of 10 = 45, if my calculations are correct. Anyway, you get my point.)			",137,44,0,19,9,0,9

I finally got around to playing it and absolutely loved it. The graphics and soundtrack are perfect. The way the story is told is really awesome and fairly unique. It's not a very long game (I think it took me about 4 hours to finish it). Towards the end of the game I started to feel like it was a bit repetitive, but never once did I want to stop playing. The game is an absolute must-play and is a truly wonderful experience.			",258,49,4,40,29,3,31

												By this point Bastion doesn't need another positive review to solidify its standing as a must have game. With only the most bitter and caustic contrarians providing negative feedback, Bastion has an approval rate of 98%. That should speak highly of the game's value but one should always strive to understand what makes something good rather than blindly following popular opinion like one more lemming in the heard and indeed one should highlight the strengths of a thing rather than simply using popular opinion to define something's value. Rest assured however, in this case, Bastion is one cliff you'll be happy to jump off of with the rest of us.Bastion begins with a young child waking up to find his world falling apart, literally. An ominous and mysterious disaster, referred to as the Calamity, has caused the fabric of the world to collapse. Finding that only he and one other person survived, the boy must recollect the essence of the world and rebuild it. Narrated by one of the best voices on planet Earth, the boy's journey takes him through the ruins of a deep and interesting setting. Indeed Bastion has one of the most unique settings in video games, its indie origins contributing to the bravery of doing something new and interesting. The game is fairly short admittedly and to discuss too much of the plot would be to give it away but trust me in that it doesn't disappoint.Mechanically the game is remarkably solid. The purpose of collecting the shards and mcguffins is to upgrade both your base and character. There are a wide variety of weapons and enough distinction between bonuses and weapons to fit a wide variety of play styles. Being of a short length, the difficulty ramps up quickly and you must choose which upgrades are most valuable to your play style. Committing is the crux of the matter as your investments need to pay off to complete later levels.With story and mechanics blended this well, I never stopped feeling engaged. My drive maintained from start to finish which is tougher that one might think. Bastion walks a very fine line with not having any lulls in the action while at the same time not being overwhelming about it. My final analysis: Buy this game. It is great.			",157,54,1,10,8,0,11

												This game has honestly impressed me with how much I enjoyed it. I bought this and Transistor back when they were on sale, no real expectations whatsoever but...wow I love this game.Pros- Great story/ lore- Art- Soundtrack- The Narrator- A bit of replayability with the different modes, the idols, and the survival/ dream sequencesCons- Personally coudln't find anything wrong with the game. I don't mean to be biased but, this was just too great of a game9/10Can't wait to see what Super Giant games comes out with next			",221,19,2,12,7,0,7

												There's nothing I can say about this game that hasn't already been said. Bought it last night, finished it last night, loved every second of it. Combat is fun, soundtrack is enthralling (especially Build a Wall), the story is captivating and evocative. it handles exposition with a finesse that's rare to see in games these days, with gameplay that makes it worth another playthrough at the least. The narrator, who I maintain is the lovechild of James Earl Jones and Keith David conceived in a vat of honey, has enough character in his voice to make all the characters in the game feel sympathetic and emotional, and the unique style of him commenting on your individual actions makes for a few entertaining moments and surprises.Like I said, if you've heard anything about this game then I'm not saying anything new. But if my added voice can help sway you, let this be testimony that I love this game.			",21,7,0,19,1,0,9

												+ Tons of atmosphere+ Great soundtrack+ Great voice work by the narrator+ Art and visual aesthetic- Not a lot of depth in combat or other gameplay features.I've played through Bastion twice now and it's still very enjoyable.  One can't really say enough about the great job Supergiant did with building an interesting and slightly mysterious world, and crammed it with atmosphere and character.  Everything from the music, the narration, the detailed and beautiful art, and interesting plot all add up to a world you like seeing and experiencing.  The music and voicework really deserve their own mention, winning many awards (not that those mean much nowadays) for both the composer and Logan Cunningham for his portrayal as the Narrator.  The best way I can describe the soundtrack is like...acoustic frontier western folk music mixed with electronica.  It's great and can easily be listened to on it's own.  The games combat mechanics are the one thing that doesn't shine quite as bright as the rest.  What is there is very solid and controls just fine, but it tends to be a bit dull and not very challenging, especially in the first half or so of the game.  It gets a bit button mashy.  Later on, more enemies and more varied weapons and projectiles pick up the pace and things feel much better.  I just wish I had the same level of enjoyment in combat throughout all of it.  There are some city building and weapon upgrade features, which are welcome, but don't have much substance.  With more time and money in the budget, I'd love to see what Supergiant can do with a more fleshed out sequel.It's the atmosphere and aesthetics that take this good game and elevate it to something special.

												After 16.116 reviews, there's nothing else to say about this game right? Wrong.Everybody feels this game differently, that's one of its assets, but some things just never change. There are some mechanics that are not explained in the game at all and I for one would have liked to know 'em before I started playing. Hence this little reviewlike walkthrough of mine came to be:First, I'd like to say you won't regret buying this game. But you already knew that, didn't you?After all, Bastion is a really fun game, Aciton RPG oriented, with a somewhat limited combat system that wil♥♥♥♥♥♥you off from time to time but don't worry. You'll get it eventually!Where was I? Oh, right...Instead of talking about the strong suits of the game, I'd like to talk about it's flaws. 'Cause yes. It's got them.Above all, I'd say there are two ways to play Bastion. Casual or Completionist.If you're heading for casual, congratulations! This game's made for you. Most levels don't last more than ten minutes and there's a specific game mode meant for you called ""painless mode"".However, if you intend to get everything in this game I must warn you. It won't be easy...Know this. You're gonna have to beat the game at least twice.Enjoy your fisrt playthrough, learn the paths, try out different weapons, smash Scumbags, feel the music and try to understad what the hell's going on. Don't worry yourself about challenges and leave the Idols for later. Just enjoy!Eventually, you'll reach the grand finale and will need to face a story changing decission. To get all the achievements you need to play both scenarios, so just pick whatever you feel like and enjoy the show. Both decissions will allow you to keep playing so don't worry yourself unnecesarily. Alas, the game feels like the best options are: 1st) Left - Left.2nd) Right - Right.One down, one to go. Once you complete the stoy for the first time, you'll unlock ""New Game +"" mode and ""Score Attack"" mode. You should know that the latter counts as a New Game + for the ""Calamity Kid"" achievement, so there's no real need to play the NG+ mode. The second playthrough's where you'll have to give your best. Start off with no less than five Idols to get the higuest amount of money and experience possible, finish the remaining challenges and enjoy your new traits. Another special move will be unlocked in the Armory (you don't need to own Portal to get it) and the History books in the Bastion will now lead you to a brand new ""Who Knows Where"" battle arena.Don't push it. Battle arenas can be ""easily"" beaten with your mortar and pike fully upgraded. But it will take some time to complete the arenas. Strategy is key, choose the right tonics to aid you and take advantage of your surroundings.In addition, since you should already be playing in ""Score Attack"" mode, you can get the ""Hard bargain"" achievement as well. It is not an easy achevement to get, but a valid method to obtain it has already been discovered. Advance in the story until you unlock the Pipe, then equip ""Black Rye"" and ""Whale Ale"" choose a long and short range weapon in the armory, equip the ""Gel Cannister"" as your special move and renounce ""Acobi"", ""Roathus"" and ""Olak"" at the Temple leaving the remaining Idols active. All you have to do now is enter the Kid's Dream and try to keep the chain with your turrets. Have fun!!After a while, you should get all the remaining achievements. Thus concluding the completionist path. Congratulations, you did it!!!Now, regardless of the path you've chosen to enjoy this game, the experience is definitely worth it, but for he completionist gamers it feels like it is a bit harder than it should be unlike what happens in Transistor for example, the next game you should be cheking on!

												Absurdly beautiful game with questions nice, unique story to boot. Multiple weapon combinations and abilities allow you to mix up how you play. Also there are shrines you can activate to make the gane harder and spirits you can equip to gain some passive abilities. By spirits I mean drinks, not ghost things.The story is a little on the short side if you just want to run through the game but if you listen to all of it and go after the challenge levels the game becomes pretty long for its price. There's hundreds of other more detailed reviews which all seem pretty good and there probably doesn't need to be another so this is all I have to say about this game. 9.5/10			",115,22,1,17,9,1,17

												Bastion is a good game ... but not a great one.  Lets get to the good stuff first.  The first thing most people will mention is the narrator and with good reason.  Everything you do in Bastion is narrated.  Whether you are fighting monsters, buying upgrades, or just standing around, the narrator always has something relavent to say.  The voice actor has a great voice for the part and he helps make something that could have been gimicy a stand out feature of the game.The art and look of the game are excellent.  Vivid colors, unique art design and locals, and a cartoony look make the game look and feel unique.  When you aren't being attacked just wondering through the different locations is a treat.  New enemies, new upgradable weapons, dreams (arenas), and boss fights keep the game feeling fresh.  Getting stuck at a certain spot, find the location to upgrade one of your weapons and go through the trial there to see if you unlock new items and upgrades.  The dreams are a good places to rack up money and face a good challenge as combinations of enemies attack you in different rounds.  The music is simple but effective.  It never gets overly complicated or stands out, it just accompanies game play and it does that well.  It may not be for everyone but I enjoyed it.The control scheme with a keyboard and mouse was a little cumbersome.  It felt hard to be precise with my movements using the WASD for my movement keys.  The mouse gave me good accuracy for targeting but given a choice I think the game would feel better being played on a controller.While it was fun upgrading my weapons, I would have liked to have ablities to unlock or upgrade on my character that would make combat even more fun and varied.  This could have lived up some of the boss fights which devolved into run far away as possible and use a missile weapon, rinse, repeat.The very end isn't a traditional boss fight.  I won't spoil it here and some may have been put off by it but I liked how it finished the story and did something other then kill the boss, roll credits.  I would recommend this game for most people to try out.  Watch the videos and if you are intrigued give it a try, I don't think you will be disappointed.			",127,33,0,16,7,0,17

												Before I actaully go into any sort of depth, for anyone that uses the Steam reviews of a game in the same way that I do, the game functions!  Some people have complained about the keyboard & mouse controls, but the controls were perfectly fine on a 360 controller.  Now, onto the review proper.Bastion is a game where a mysterious calamity (simply called ""The Calamity"" by survivors) has wiped out most of the world's population and shot most of the land into the air.  You play as a boy (simply called ""The Kid""), and must traverse various different locations to find Cores, magical crystals that will help to rebuild The Bastion.  One of the first things that people will notice about the game is the unique way that the narrative is framed.  Many of the different things that you do in the game are accompanied by a narration.  The voice actor perfectly fits the Steampunk/western style of the game, and is an absolute joy to listen to, even though he is the only voice actor in the game (aside from a few of the songs that contain lyrics and a small amount of dialogue with another character at the end).  The narration is meant to be one of the characters in the game retelling of past events, occasionally foreshadowing something or giving his personal thoughts.  The game allows you to find out about the lore of the game and the backstories of the characters as if you were actually the person listening to the story, allowing for you to decide what is true and what is made up.  Additionally, the beautiful handpainted graphics add to the atmosphere of the game in an incredible way.  You may end up feeling as if you don't want to kill any of the monsters, since they look so interesting, but avoiding them is generally not an option.  The game also explicitly mentions that many of the creatures used to be docile before The Calamity, leaving it up to the player why they suddenly want to kill The Kid (at one point, the narrator even says ""At first they left the barge alone, then they saw who was riding it."").Style can only account for a part of the experience of playing a game, though, so onto the gameplay.  The game has a sort of hack-and-slash style to it, and can feel very satisfying.  The weapons are all nicely varied, allowing for many different choices, and, in addition, each combination of two weapons elicits a unique line from the narrator.  The weapon upgrading system, featuring the ability to switch between 2 paths (usually representing effects versus damage), and its feature of allowing the player to mix and match upgrades at a will, adds even more depth.  Despite feeling satisfactory, the combat can feel a bit too easy once you get the hang of it, but learning each weapon as more are introduced throughout the game is great.  The ""Proving Grounds,"" of which there is one for each weapon, however, are a very nice challenge for the most part, and completing all of them is very rewarding, even if you as the player don't like to use the weapon that it's relating to.  The spirits that can upgrade your stats are a nice touch too, being a very unique way of upgrading and, again, eliciting a unique line of dialogue from the narrator whenever one is equipped, usually talking about its Pre-Calamity use or reputation.Of course, since the soundtrack of this game is so famous, I would be remiss to review it without mentioning the music.  The soundtrack in this game is possibly the best I've ever heard.  The area tracks fit perfectly with whatever kind of atmosphere that area wants to convey.  The musical cues are spot-on, and the few previously mentioned tracks (entitled ""Build That Wall""; ""Mother I'm Here""; and ""Setting Sail, Coming Home,"" respectively) are indescribably wonderful.  Even while typing out this review, I'm listening to the soundtrack in the background.  It's THAT good, and I'd say definitely worth a look, even if you don't plan on playing the game.On release, this game recieved major critical acclaim.  I have to say that, even though I only ever played it 3 years later, the game is wholly deserving of any and all praise.  It has, very occasionally, been accused of pretentiousness, and, to this, I have to say that a game being ""artsy"" and it being ""pretentious"" are two very different things.  The handpainted backgrounds and incredible score add a level of atmosphere rarely seen in games.  The gameplay is very satisfying and rewarding, and there was a moment in the story, close to the end, that genuinely made me, a person who tries to keep my emotions to myself, burst into tears.  I won't spoil it by saying what it is, but what I can say about it is that it's one of the most emotional and well set up moments I've ever seen in anything.  I don't really know what I can add to the discussion about this game, as I'm sure that all I've said has been said elsewhere by other people, but, if you've read this far, all I can say is that this is a game worth getting.  Anyone who can appreciate games as an artform owes it to themselves to play this game.  It's fun, it's emotional, it's amazing.			",73,21,0,15,7,0,2

												I may start by saying what I didn't like of this game, which was the character design of Kid and the Old Man, simply because everything else was more than good.The game is a gorgeous adventure in a colorful world which thanks to the art style seems to be painiting itself to completion right before your eyes; this world gets also blended with a perfectly fitting soundtack and a narrator who (constantly, probably a bit too much) describes your actions with a charming low tone.About the plot, lore or anything related to, you're not playing this game for that. The plot is cryptic (not as much as Transistor's one, but still you'll have a lot of imagination going through) and quite short but still interesting, both moving and melancholic with a somewhat good ending.This game is good, there's no reason not to buy and play this game. Supergiant Collection STRONGLY recommended, because of Transistor and the soundtracks.			",325,125,7,44,34,2,49

												I played Bastion for the first time a few years ago. Now that I've re-played it, I just have to write a positive review about it.This game is excellent in every possible aspect. The gameplay is fun and extremely adaptable to the player's skill level: if you want to play easy you can just go on with the story without using idols or face challenges, while if you are a completist and look for something more serious you can activate all or few idols (which give enemies various kinds of buffs) and try to beat every proving ground. There's really something for every taste here.The story is nice and captivating, the kind you appreciate even more when you replay the game a second time. Is incredible with how many details the writers managed to fill the plot considering that everything is narrated by Zulf's voice while you play. Undoubtedly one of the most successful experiments in alternative narration I've ever had the pleasure to play with.Artistic direction is also really beautiful, the art, the animations, the maps, everything is so polished and detailed that it's simply a pleasure to look at this game running. And the music...is great. Just great.Really, it's hard to find a flaw in this little masterpiece of indie gaming...Zulf's voice talking over and over can be annoying sometimes, maybe? Honestly it's all I can think of when I ask myself what Bastion's defects are.What else can I say... hell, just buy this game already. You won't regret it.			",302,91,1,26,12,1,25

												Cool levels, and there's good variation in their artwork themes, but they are very linear. I liked the enemies a lot, there are a load of different enemies with unique and funny designs, and cool and varied attacks. A con about the combat is that you have no choice in how to engage an enemy by choosing different paths to different situations, but there is in the weapon choice. There's a big amount of weapons, and they are varied, but I feel like they just got stronger the further in the game, so that there's really not much reason to pick a bow over carbine. Lastly, the sound-effects were varied and the voice-acting and the soundtrack was absolutely stunning. The creative story-telling with an omniscient narrator and the sounds and voices truly elevate this game above mediocrity.8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is such an anomaly.  Its a zelda-esque action-rpg with colorful, lovely graphics and an amazing soundtrack, but the gameplay is very average.  Not bad, just average.  Two weapons slots and a special move, block and dodge, and that's it.  But yet, its a fantastic game.  I think what really makes it is the narrator.  The game is only above average, and probably wouldn't have held my attention past the 3 or 4th level, but the narrator keeps this running dialogue going the entire time that fills you in on the main characters backstory, thoughts, and feelings.  And it actually interacts with your characters actions in real time.  Like when I was first starting, I just started bashing stuff with a hammer, and the narrator said, ""and then the kid decided to just rage for a while,"" and I lost it.  This is one of those games that is more than the sum of its parts.  I totally recommend it, and have totally enjoyed every minute of it.			",159,34,1,69,6,2,40

												Bastion is a game that i will forever treasure in my mind as one of the best games ive ever played.It has a handpainted visual, great gameplay, stunning soundtrack and over all a good general feel to the game.Its an action-adventure game with some rpg elements, looking from a bird perspective. With a variety of weapons and skills that you can costumize to your playstyle and liking. All from melee manmode to kiting longdistance sniper shooting.You play as a kid who woke up in a his world after a great calamity, in a quest to gather fragments to rebuild a sanctuary known as The Bastion. The games has heart, it has joy and it has a great narrator. I can easily recommend it to anyone!			",210,62,0,16,6,2,6

												I loved the music in this game and how I actually had a choice in what equipment to use instead of being forced to use certain weapons.  I also like the choices at the end which resulted in an interesting final obstacle.  The star of the game is the narration - makes me want to pick up the DOTA voiceover.  short and sweet game that I wouldn't mind playing through again when I'm done w/ my backlog.  I think this is how I was supposed to have felt after beating the old zelda games if it weren't for the dated gameplay / graphics...			",122,29,2,16,9,0,13

												Bastion features an awesome platform/Action experience with minor but satisfying RPG elements and great visuals, but the real meat is in the story. The whole game world is narrated as you play along, and features great voice acting and music. Actual combat is fluid and has a lot of variety, and the game has high replayability due to keeping your stats between plays. Highly recommended for people who like ARPG's, or who enjoy delving into story.			",391,102,9,40,37,5,67

												Bastion is a good game, make no mistake, but it's considerable style outweighs its substance. It's certainly a beautiful game, the hand-drawn art style graphics are very pretty and distinctive, fitting well with the general tone, although they can sometimes get a little busy. There were also times where the isometric viewpoint combined with some strange shapes made the safe pathway a little less than obvious. Visually, it's a treat from beginning to end.The soundtrack, in my opinion, is the Bastion's strongest asset. The score is wonderful, taking old-western guitar twang and mixing it beautifully with other velvety tones that make the soundtrack bundle worth the extra dough. The narration is also great, adding a new and interesting way of framing the story and directing the player with a voice that sounds like molten caramel. The story it frames is also fairly good, if a little bewildering to start with.On the downside, the actual gameplay is fairly homogenous. Most of the game consists of ""go to a place, hack and slash until everything is dead, grab a magical something-or-other and flee before the ground disappears from under you"" on a repeating cycle.  The variety of weapons and special attacks and the challenges offered by the Shrines (difficulty-boosting optional extras) and other challenges offer a little bit of variety, but I can't see myself making use of the New Game Plus feature. Despite there being two possible endings, I just didn't enjoy the 5 hours I spent with it enough to want to go back any time soon.Overall though, considering I paid quite a lot less than the list price for Bastion, I still got my money's worth and would recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind beauty being mostly skin deep.

Got myself a gamepad for another game, and decided to get some games I didnt play before that supposed to be cool to play with a gamepad. Got this and Mark of the Ninja. While second one is a really good and well done game, this one is amazing. It is good for any type of player, you can play for fun or invoke shrines and play rather hardcore - its all up to you. Also a proper learning curve - as soon as you get better with the game you start to enjoy it even more. 9.5/10,			",42,10,0,14,0,0,9

												I may start by saying what I didn't like of this game, which was the character design of Kid and the Old Man, simply because everything else was more than good.The game is a gorgeous adventure in a colorful world which thanks to the art style seems to be painiting itself to completion right before your eyes; this world gets also blended with a perfectly fitting soundtack and a narrator who (constantly, probably a bit too much) describes your actions with a charming low tone.About the plot, lore or anything related to, you're not playing this game for that. The plot is cryptic (not as much as Transistor's one, but still you'll have a lot of imagination going through) and quite short but still interesting, both moving and melancholic with a somewhat good ending.This game is good, there's no reason not to buy and play this game. Supergiant Collection STRONGLY recommended, because of Transistor and the soundtracks.			",325,125,7,44,34,2,49

												This is a nice little hack and slash rpg game thats not like many games you've played. You play as a kid trying to revive his home, The Bastion. He has to travel around to other areas looking for cores to bring back his home to life and build building to improve it. Each time you collect a core from an area you get to upgrade the Bastion. The game has a nice narative to the story and its easy to pick up and play. In some areas the ground appears as you walk and some it falls appart. This makes the game interesting and fun. As you progress in the story and open new lands to explore you will find items that allow you to upgrade your weapons and find new abilities. This a fun little game and I highly recommend it.8/10			",331,70,13,35,21,6,23

												There's nothing I can say about this game that hasn't already been said. Bought it last night, finished it last night, loved every second of it. Combat is fun, soundtrack is enthralling (especially Build a Wall), the story is captivating and evocative. it handles exposition with a finesse that's rare to see in games these days, with gameplay that makes it worth another playthrough at the least. The narrator, who I maintain is the lovechild of James Earl Jones and Keith David conceived in a vat of honey, has enough character in his voice to make all the characters in the game feel sympathetic and emotional, and the unique style of him commenting on your individual actions makes for a few entertaining moments and surprises.Like I said, if you've heard anything about this game then I'm not saying anything new. But if my added voice can help sway you, let this be testimony that I love this game.			",21,7,0,19,1,0,9

												Bastion is a good game ... but not a great one.  Lets get to the good stuff first.  The first thing most people will mention is the narrator and with good reason.  Everything you do in Bastion is narrated.  Whether you are fighting monsters, buying upgrades, or just standing around, the narrator always has something relavent to say.  The voice actor has a great voice for the part and he helps make something that could have been gimicy a stand out feature of the game.The art and look of the game are excellent.  Vivid colors, unique art design and locals, and a cartoony look make the game look and feel unique.  When you aren't being attacked just wondering through the different locations is a treat.  New enemies, new upgradable weapons, dreams (arenas), and boss fights keep the game feeling fresh.  Getting stuck at a certain spot, find the location to upgrade one of your weapons and go through the trial there to see if you unlock new items and upgrades.  The dreams are a good places to rack up money and face a good challenge as combinations of enemies attack you in different rounds.  The music is simple but effective.  It never gets overly complicated or stands out, it just accompanies game play and it does that well.  It may not be for everyone but I enjoyed it.The control scheme with a keyboard and mouse was a little cumbersome.  It felt hard to be precise with my movements using the WASD for my movement keys.  The mouse gave me good accuracy for targeting but given a choice I think the game would feel better being played on a controller.While it was fun upgrading my weapons, I would have liked to have ablities to unlock or upgrade on my character that would make combat even more fun and varied.  This could have lived up some of the boss fights which devolved into run far away as possible and use a missile weapon, rinse, repeat.The very end isn't a traditional boss fight.  I won't spoil it here and some may have been put off by it but I liked how it finished the story and did something other then kill the boss, roll credits.  I would recommend this game for most people to try out.  Watch the videos and if you are intrigued give it a try, I don't think you will be disappointed.			",127,33,0,16,7,0,17

												I love this game! I've heard many people say how it's a short game, but so far I'm finding it to be a decent amount of material to play through.The narration definitely sells this game just by itself. The developers created a game where they thought of almost everything that the player can do, and made it so that the voice telling the story also works alongside you to make snarky comments about your playstyle or your ingame actions. Absolutely brilliant, because I've never see this amount of depth nor details in any other game before!If you don't care about that, there's always the great visuals. I don't play a huge variety of games, so reads of this review may take this with a grain of salt, but the artwork on this game feels rather unique to me. At the very least, it certainly isn't like all the other shiny, 3D, HD mainstream graphics out there nowadays.If the reader is  looking for a specific part of the gameplay that I personally liked, it was the many goals and challenges that were made available ingame, milestones to reach that would give the player a sense of accomplishment. Along with these are the customization options for the weapons' effects. There are 5 pairs of choices for how you can improve your weapons, and there are about 10+? different weapons to choose from.Together, the weapon customization and milestone (Vigils, they call it ingame) make the game a nice casual challenge for me.A decent story doesn't hurt either, but I must admit it's not mind-blowingly interesting. Then again, I haven't finished this game yet (I think I'm 80% through the game), so I might come back to amend this review or write a new one. In anycase, I didn't buy this game for just the story and neither should other people reading this.Buy this game, and simply enjoy the fun/humor that Bastion provides!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of very few action RPGs with a compelling story and good characters. If compelling stories and good characters are what you're looking for, play it. It's good. It's really good.It's not a stereotypical action RPG either. You start with your character waking up in his bed with all the world except the 10-foot radius around him just gone. When you walk, the world floats up and pieces itself back together in front of you. It's not only a cool visual effect. It's also part of the story's worldbuilding and a metaphor for the main character trying to piece his life back together after a catastrophic event that evidently left the world wiped out.Gameplay-wise, the action is skillful and fast -- much more skillful and much faster than I could handle at higher difficulties (note: difficulty levels are built into the game's lore, so that's pretty cool too). It's also fun and responsive, though the isometric perspective combined with the colorful levels and masses of objects and enemies alike moving around the screen at once, it can get confusing. It's never so confusing that it becomes unplayable, though. It just starts to feel a little like a bullet-hell shooter at times, and it's not even a shooter.The music's not getting out of here without a mention. I got the soundtrack in one of the Humble Bundles, and I've listened to it far more than any other video game soundtrack (except perhaps Metal Gear). It has an electro-western feel to it that's a bit difficult to describe. The lead acoustic guitar is tuned down to something odd that I tried out on my own guitar (note: just a simple open strum sounds cool in the tuning Bastion's music uses). There are vocals in a few of the songs, and they all come in at exactly the right time for the meaning of the song and the context in which they're played to punch you right in the feels. Sometimes, the music fits so well (mostly the instrumental stuff) that I didn't even realize it was there. It's incredibly unique for a game in the fantasy genre, and the same could be said of all the game's design, from art to writing to music and even to gameplay to an extent.Each weapon feels different and serves a different playstyle, which is more than can be said for nearly any other game in Bastion's genre. The Cael hammer, the default weapon and the one I used throughout nearly the whole game, feels like it has weight and power packed in every swing. The sword is quick and slicey, the guns are suitably punchy, and the bow is precise enough to feel great.If you thought Diablo was the king of the action RPG genre (any of the three), I request you try Bastion. At least in my opinion, it completely demolishes all three Diablo games in every area on which it contends (Bastion has no loot system, so there's no contest there): story, characters, art style, music, worldbuilding, combat, and probably a few I missed.Play Bastion. You'll be doing yourself a favor.			",142,25,1,25,11,1,11

												A quick TL;DR, if you're buying the game on the spot; the interface is good, the story is interesting, the combat system is fun, just buy it if you're into the genre.The Interface is surprisingly user friendly. It's compatible with all sorts of things, from controllers to your plain mouse and keyboard. They're all pretty intuitive and easy to learn, so you'll get used to the controls quickly. It's also got your usual subtitles and your audio settings. You can have different profiles, which allows you to start over from scratch without destroying your perfect save. Tons of resolution options, too. Generally pretty solid.The story is pretty vague at first; you're a kid, well, you're The Kid, you wake up on a floating island miles away from sea level due to some apocalyptic event, and an omnipresent narrator voice is talking to you, describing your every move. I'd rather not go any further with the story (and you've heard this tons of times. Believe me, I also get tired of hearing this, but this is for real): you should experience it yourself. Supergiant prides itself on digging out lore out of seemingly nothing, it's practically a talent. This game has amazing replayability and you can easily get lost just slashing through everything. The game includes idols that will rise the stakes if you find it too easy. Oh, and the combat system? Love it. I'm biased, since I love hack and slash games, but this game features a diverse cast of weapons that you can mod for extra perks, letting you cherrypick your favorite perks. Will you go for extra damage, or settle for a higher critical chance? Besides weapons, you can drink spirits that will give you passive perks, from extra resistance to retaliating damage.There's not much that I can say about the artwork that hasn't been said. All of the art for the game is very impressive and, to top, very fitting. To close this, since we're talking about art, there's a reason the game is tagged with great soundtrack. The music is also very unique, the artist even giving it its own name (I seriously cannot remember what he called it, but it was a mouthful). Adds a lot of character to the game.Buy it. At best, you'll love it and play it again, and again, and again (or not, it's a 6-11 hour long game), at worst you'll play it once and be kind of okay about it. But if you're bent on getting all those achievements, you will clock out more hours than that. Just go play it. It's art.			",18,9,0,4,5,1,2

												For anyone who enjoys indie hack-and-slash, story-driven, and adventure games, I simply cannot recommend this game enough. I played through most of it on just one weekened, but it was a very refreshing and enjoyable game to just sit down and play.

												Bastion is one of the most captivating indie games i've played in a while. Everything is so sophisticated that it threw me off and captured my attention immediately. The gameplay, I thought, was going to be kind of boring but it suprised me and was very enjoyable with numerous weapons that kept me interested in trying new combos of weapons and abilities. As well the game isn't as easy as I thought it was going to be and was a very nice balance of boss battles and diffucult enemies. If you want fun gameplay this game you should just get alone. But it just doesn't stop there the music is amazing. It completely captures the tone of the game and intense fights that you will get in too. Lastly the story is very interesting filled with a rich world that will keep you interested. Bastion is a complete package that should be looked in too if you like great story narrative and gameplay.			",112,17,6,9,6,1,2

												Do I recomend this game? Yes, yes I do.Why?Well, this is a game that gives you great art, a fantasic story and one of the most epic soundtracks ever. The gameplay is fun and even if the characters you meet are rather limited (4) and you dont learn a lot about them from the ""main story quests"" you still get quite atached to them and you have the chance to hear their backstory throughout the gameplay.There are some stuff that might bug certain people, it's not the longest and most difficult game, I cleared the game after about 5 hours but doing the story mode plus and doing all the extra stuff can give you a few more hours of great fun and the game does give you tasks that you can try to achieve. The enemies can feel a bit repetative but this isn't something I really thought much about since I was focusing on the story being told in the background.So in the end, it has it's downsides but to me and most people (as far as I know) the + is worth more than the -			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The unique and detailed voice over narration helps to draw the player into the story further.It has a varied selection of weapons as well as a item upgrade system which never feels like it requires too much repetition to complete. In addition, the arena challenges, shrine handicaps, character buffs, and New Game+ mode aid completion of all items and overall replayability.The gameplay reminds me of 2D Legend of Zelda, although Bastion feels faster paced and can require faster reactions for dodging or blocking attacks.

It is a true indie gem that I cannot convey my appretiation for to a satisfactory degree. All I can say is, I wholeheartedly recommend this, and hope that you will enjoy the outstanding journey Supergiant Games created.			",324,90,9,38,27,6,28

												Absolutely get this game! Everyone should play Bastion at least once. It does offer newgame plus, but I honestly wouldn't bother unless you want to give yourself a challenge or you're one of those acheivement junkies. The artstyle and graphics are great! The audio is even better. The best thing about the game is the story. It's very rich and keeps you wanting to play to find out what is going to happen. Also the narrator's voice is just perfect and makes this game complete. The overall experience is fantastic; I was actually a little sad that it ended so soon. The biggest drawback though is the length of the game. It's short. Although it says I played around 11 hours, that was becauseI had initially played around 4 hours back when I got in 2012, but I just recently decided to start a new game. So, it really only took around 7-8 hours to complete. However, I didn't finish all the weapon challenges and I didn't unlock every upgrade, so there's at least another hour or two still there. If you can get it on sale, defintly consider it! Well worth your money and time. Short, but bloody good! 9/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A very cool game, with one hell of a narrator, and some of the greatest 'game writing' ever. The difficulty curve is where it should be, and skill progression felt natural. There aren't any complaints that come to mind when thinking about this game, other than a 'split choice' ending - where I really wanted to know the outcome of each choice before making it, and would have rather had one ending held off as a 'real' ending until a second playthrough - but I suppose that would have been a♥♥♥♥♥♥move. So kudos to these guys. Next stop: Transistor.			",179,47,2,9,5,2,23

												The game is hard.  It's damn hard.  I died a lot.  But god damn, this game is good.The story is fantastic and takes us on a journey with The Kid and the few people left alive in the world that he meets along the way.The music is top notch.  If you buy this game, you might as well buy the Bastion Soundtrack Edition.  Matching the music's tone with the game is a hard thing to do right, but the creators did that perfectly.The RPG elements in this game are not traditional.  You don't level up, but rather you find parts you can apply to your many weapons.  For each quest/mission/level, you choose approximately three weapons to take with you.  Each have their own properties, and some are better specialized against certain monsters.  Throughout the game, due to your play-style, you'll likely find a set of weapons that you enjoy using the most.There is much replayability.  Whether wanting to discover all alternate endings or just wanting to complete certain challenges, you'll get hours of enjoyment out of the game.			",899,330,20,114,83,8,164

												A perfect game. I didn't think much of this game before playing, but after I did I was amazed. Bastion is basically a top- down action RPG where you (as a boy) have to go around looking for shards to save the world.The music is great and suits the game perfectly. You also have a neat selection of weapons to choose from such as a sword,hammer, musket etc. with unique upgrades to suit your playstyle. There are about 12-13 levels in this game which are all feel different from each other. Voice acting is also good as well. There are different game modes available such as survival and score attack and new game plus which add to some replayability to the game. Finally,the story is remarkable and something you will remeber for a while.A problem I have with the game is the angles of some of the levels. I kept falling off because it was somewhat difficult to walk in a diagonal line in order to stay on some of the platforms. Another problem is that the direction your facing with the shield may not block all attacks as intended.Should you buy it? Well, after playing the game for 16 hours (normal, new game plus  and all survival modes). I still have an urge to go back and play this game all over again.			",420,113,10,57,34,2,84

Another (huge for me) plus is the replayability option.One word: Awesome.TIP: If you're having some wierd low FPS caps (locked at 30 FPS as suppose at 60 FPS and dropping even with top-end hardware) and the command fix -nofixedstep does not work. Just go to the menu and toggle Vsync off, get back to the game, and toggle Vsync on. Seemed to work for me :)			",15,1,0,7,2,0,1

												I'll Admit,  I haven't played the game nor Have I written any reviews up to this point.  Never the less if my typing can sway one single person -- I shall continue onward.The soundtrack is definately worth the sale price this game offers alone.  I hope the RPG elements the game offers are at least as sweet.  I know it's a fairly basic game graphics wise, but if it's at least as cool as the music is -- Not Going To Be A Problem With Me.Recommended.			",110,9,0,23,3,0,20

												Bastion is an isometric action RPG with a killer soundtrack.  You play as a kid living in a world torn apart by a mysterious, apocalyptic event called the Calamity whose best chance of survival lies with the Bastion.The gameplay is pretty standard but the real attraction here is the story, which really picks up the pace around second act.  Logan Cunningham does a fantastic job as the narrator, providing the only voice you'll hear throughout your journey.This game is a worthy buy at any price and you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you skip it.

												The game itself seems like it would have been done before, but the difference is in the pacing and visibly the art. The game feels amazing as every attack, hit, and evade your character does is important to the way you want to play. And speaking of playing, the different weapons in the game offer outstanding gameplay changes. You want to be able to run up to some one and slash as fast as you can? Sure, pick the machete. You want to smash stuff doing tuns of damage in as few hits as possible? Got your big♥♥♥♥♥hammer right here. I don't think I need to go into how good the narration and soundtrack is. A really good experience overall. Worth the 14.99 (at the current moment of this post). Pick it up whenever you feel like all your other games are stale.			",130,16,2,10,6,0,2

												9.4/10. If you're looking for a game with the most complex fighting system in gaming, this isn't your game. If you're looking for anything else, then this game goes above and beyond any other indie game I've played. The gameplay is smooth and leaves you wishing you had paused to smash that last box. The narration, which I expected to be annoying and immersion inhibiting, was one of the greatest aspects of the game, and in fact made me feel more like I was a part of the story than anything else. Speaking of the story, this is one of the greatest game plots I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. No spoilers, but I genuinely had to consider the choice at the end for a minute or so. And of course, I can't talk about Bastion without mentioning the music. The song placement is powerful, and I never once felt annoyed with the overuse of a particular melody. The soundtrack itself is phenomenal as well.tl;dr: Great game. Amazing story. Narrator one bar under Morgan Freeman. Awesome music. Buy it now.			",46,5,1,10,10,0,15

												Bastion, a really artsy action game. This game right here is one of the most artsy games i've played in a while. Bastion focuses mainly on story and gameplay with the awesome weapons powers and the narraratng from the well narrarator. He is one of the main parts of the game with the speach pattern being the most famous (I've seen many videos joking about it). The enemys in this game are nothing to right home about but they do offer a good challange at times. But where i love this game the most is the kind of villan in this game one of the survivor of the apocalypse who eventually goes insane and trashes your whole bastion island. Overall this game is artsy fun that just has to be played i give it my score of 5/5			",87,21,0,11,12,1,4

												Where to begin? This game is absolutley beautiful, from the soundtrack, to the different regions/""worlds"", the art style, the very vibe it gives off; it is amazing. There is something so mystical and vibrant about the environment that I just can't put my finger on. The Narrator's voice also adds a lot to the game; he is the one who walks you through vivid memories and reflections of the characters in the game, and without hardly any clips or unskippable sequences to accompany it. No other speaking voice besides the Narrator's is used, and I honestly wouldn't have it any other way; his descriptions and story-telling is really all you need, and adds to the feel of the game in a very positive way.The story of the game itself feels fresh, and is very interesting if you can keep up with listening to the Narrator while trying to fight your way through intense enemy sequences, which is my only real gripe. Then again, its best to save time and works more fluidly for him to explain while you are fighting in the area he is explaining. If you want to know the fine details of the story, you really can't afford to zone out for too long, because he describes things in simple sentences (that do the job and do it fantastically), but make it all the more harder to refocus and understand what just happened.The gameplay is very smooth and just works. No complaints there. As you travel through each region, the ground literally places itself piece by piece out in front of you, adding to the beauty and mystical vibe of the game. I love all the different weapons and skills you can equip and upgrade to use in battle; it makes everything more diverse and suitable to your playing style, which is kind of a standard for an RPG, but the game has its unique twist all the same. A drawback is that if you die, you have to start that region/level all over instead of having a checkpoint to teleport to. The enemies are varied, but they seem to have the same themes depending on which part of the game you are in and/or what region/level you are playing. They are not too difficult to defeat, but you can make it more challenging by using Divine Idols which can make enemies more resistant to attacks, hit harder, etc.Overall, this game is simply gorgeous and all-around fantastic, involving some of the best art styles, music, and usage of a Narrator I've ever seen. I would definitley reccomend to anyone who wants a great adventure with a good story.			",38,9,0,2,2,0,2

Very gripping narrative told campfire story-style by a narrator who pretty much narrates everything you do as if it was a part of the story. the soundtrack is AMAZING! and a mix of acoustic frontier music and techno. (Many people have compared the music to firefly). The controls take a bit getting used to when it comes to maneuvering around on platforms and not falling off, as well as being able to tell what is a platform and what is your death, but other than that this game is 11/10 in my book.

It is a true indie gem that I cannot convey my appretiation for to a satisfactory degree.

												Maybe a tad overrated as far as indie titles go, but it's definitely worth your time. The narration technique is the standout feature. The art and music will always keep your attention. The game does a fantastic job of pacing your advancement and keeping you hooked on achieving goals and unlocking gear. The only thing I didn't care for was the story. Maybe I just have a hard time caring for stories of such extreme, fantastical settings, but I had zero attachment to what was happening. That's fine though. Was easily worth the $5. I ended up stopping midway into New Game Plus and not unlocking all the gear upgrades.			",501,122,11,54,26,6,76

												Bastion is a great game with a personally my favorite story in video game history, it has alot of customization combined with great level design makes playing through the game feel fresh, and it has multiple endings and a new game plus, and it has about 4 hours per run through without doing any of the side missions so if you do all the endings without doing any sidequests thats a whole 16 hours, Bastion is an amazing game.

Bastion eradicates the need of that all through realtime dynamic narration which is altered by the way you play, and the choices you make!			",73,17,0,10,4,0,6

The visual style is pretty nice as well. I was expecting a bit more from the story, but nevertheless it was still interesting and especially considering what other games in the genre usually offer.I would definetely recommend it, though I'm not quite sure it lives up to the hype.

Just go to the menu and toggle Vsync off, get back to the game, and toggle Vsync on. Seemed to work for me :)			",15,1,0,7,2,0,1

												The soundtrack! Just the soundtrack! It's possibly the best thing about this game. I have spent a good time just in the main menu listening to that guitar track.The world of Bastion is a wonderful world, there is nothing like it that I know of. All the little things like the skyway travel system in the hub or the fact you don't just have ""Special abilities"" you have black tonics. The Bastion itself and the characters are just wonderful and add to the world. The artistic design of the whole world is very different but also very good such as how the floor appears and builds itself underneath you as you walk. The game itself is not a massive graphically demanding shiney game like Crysis but it still looks lovely due to the art and aesthetic.The combat is kind of simple but is fine tuned and very skilful. You rely on your skill in fighting and dodging to win, just spamming the attack button won't work. The upgrades is very much the same, it's simple but effective. None of the weapons become over powered by any upgrades, they are merely just your personal play style. Do you want to use the great big two handed Cael Hammer or use the fast shooting and nimble Fanged Repeater?The story is a bit grim, taking place after what is just called ""The Calamity"" which you are slowly fed information about along with the rest of the background story but it is done so well. This is due to the narrator who is possibly the best voiced and best paced narrator I have ever heard besides maybe Thomas Was Alone. It is done so well i would recommend the game purely for that. But thankfully Bastion is great is every regard and so i can recommend it for everything. Which I do.			",219,25,2,22,43,4,64

But maybe I'm just a bad gamer.The Western-style narration isn't my thing and got kind of annoying to me after a while, but I can see how some would enjoy it.These are my only complaints; otherwise, I found the game fun, interesting, and unique.

												It's a short game, probably less than 10 hours, and you can finish the story in a night.  This is not a lot of time to sell the player on a character, much less a whole bespoke world. Fortunately, the game is engaging and unrelated enough to the story that you can enjoy it, while its obscure story flows around you. By its end, though, you will find yourself invested, and actually caring about this world you're living in.Because, here's the thing: This game is just so damn beautiful. Its music, its art, its story... creates a story-book atmosphere that -- I'm not kidding, here -- touches the soul. Yes, I think you should play this game.  The game, by the way, supports a mode that allows you to experience the world somewhat safely, which makes the game easy for anyone to experience and enjoy.			",157,20,3,19,15,0,27

												The Facts~Game rating based on the ESRB: E (Everyone)Single-PlayerPlatforms: Microsoft Windows, Mac OS C, XBox 360, iOS, GoogleChrome, Linux, OnLive.Developer: Supergiant Games.Genre: Action Role-playing.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Plot-A great calamity has struck the world, and you, a lone kid has to find out why and how to fix it. You travel through the world searching for various items to restore the Bastion and to find what survivors that you can. Challenging foes and exploring what is left of the world until you finally find what you can to prevail.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Character Design-Playing through you will find that at the start, you didn't know anything about the characters, as few as there are. Through the gameplay you will find out more and more, who they were before the story began, and how it was changing them. It doesn't stop there either. Characters that have no place in the game yet were every bit as significant in the past come into play and you get to know a little about them and how they fit into the world that once was.Through the telling of the characters you will begin to feel a bit attached and even befriend the narrator through all the story.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Music & Artwork-This is where the game hits a home run in full, with music playing constantly in the background of gameplay it adds for a wonderful aura to the game, you are never left to feel alone and it is always a mellow tempo until a fight ensues, and then it picks up pace a tad. The sounds the emit from battle are flawless and the narration is one of my favorite details.The artwork is suburb, the coloration style and way the world literally builds itself before your very eyes is uncanny. It truly makes you feel more in tune with exploring. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gameplay-The controls are actually incredibly smooth for an indie game, I was very impressed. There is not much to be said other than that.Customization was a large feature in building the bastion and even in picking what weapons and special ability you wanted to have by your side in the heat of a battle.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Conclusion-All in all, after getting this game, I learned never to judge a game before I play it again. This was a fantastic game and I am proud to own it. With all this said I proudly give Bastion a 10/10 with a 8.5/10 replay value.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------			",92,6,1,12,8,0,1

												Why have I not recommended this yet?  Well, you get a crappy rec because it's NaNo month and I'm supposed to be writing about things that aren't Bastion.Okay, Bastion is amazing.  The art direction is beautiful, the music is exactly what it needs to be and more for every scenario and atmosphere in the game (I put it on a CD for driving, actually), the gameplay is simple and appealing, yet deep, and certainly not easy enough to disappoint.  Last, but most definitely not least, is the narrator.  The narrator narrates, tells the story, and commentates on everything you do.  This is a story about death, remorse, solitude, nostalgia, life, and hope that's told as you play it.  Get it.			",240,249,1,33,23,2,14

												*whistles a catchy tune from Bastion*It could be any one of the beautiful songs from the soundtrack. ONE of them will stick in your head when you play this. If you're unlucky, more than one song will stick AND YOU WILL LOVE EVERY MINUTE OF IT....and if you thought the music was catchy, the gameplay and graphics will leave you wanting more. And if you play for the stories... well, you're going to love it. The combat can be adjusted so anybody can play it happily.You want to play for the story? The No-Sweat mode will take the combat right down to the minimum. (My choice!)You feel the urge to go a-la- Dark Souls? Normal mode with all shrines invoked will cause your character to die every few minutes unless you're a pro. (Don't say I didn't warn you!)The graphics are cute, but never overly so. And no matter how cute the enemies, you WILL know they're enemies. No worries about bits of the background suddenly turning out to be a deadly boss without due warning. Only gripe in the whole game - one or two bits of scenery looked safe to walk on, even though they weren't.tl;dr - BUY THIS, YOU WILL PROBABLY LOVE THIS FOR SOME REASON. STORY, GRAPHICS, SOUNDTRACK, GAMEPLAY, OR THE WHOLE THING. YOU WILL LOVE IT FOR SOMETHING.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great little game, what is there more to sayI liked the soundtracks very muchI hope they'll get it on sale sometime (wasn't on sale at the same time as the game)The narration feels pretty unique to me and rather good, I loved how the narrator comments on almost every single action making me feel like it's really my own story (he will comment differently based on your results and the little choices you make (even if in the end there is not much game altering choices that I know of so far but I have not finished the game yet)I always feel compounded to get back to it and improve my bastion a little more.I love the fact that you can dynamically alter the difficulty for more rewards, while it shortens some of the grinding,  the increased challenge is not something to be laughed at. Some upgrade path are not always straight damage/resistance increases or instead requires specific conditions which in my humble opinion makes the game more interesting.My only regret would be that there is an optional built-in autoaim which is almost required for some challenges (at least it sure feels like it was balanced for players to use it and abuse it ",95,11,4,9,6,0,7

												I finally committed to beating this game.  As expected, I was impressed with the art and use of narration.  I appreciated the length of the game and the music was great too.  The story was uterlly confusing and I didn't care about it at all, so choosing an ending was empty and pointless.  The combat felt ok...nothing to write home about.  I settled on a setup that felt the strongest and stuck with it the entire game.  I wasn't compelled do another playthrough. I'm glad I finally finished it and it left a memorable mark.

												This game is an indie masterpiece!A very unique style of storytelling gives a very unique mood and feel to the game.And the gameplay is varied, rewarding & fun!Manuscript writers often say that tending to a narrator to tell the story is cheap and a bad excuse for a bad storytelling. But i believe that it depends on how you use the narrator ;) ",146,20,2,10,13,2,16

												Bastion is what I consider the ultimate example of pacing in a videogame. The game hits you hard with major challenges early on, and steadily ramps up the difficulty while also providing a lot of new weapons and concepts to the player steadily. What's more, the game never keeps you pinned down in one spot for too long. There's always some new interesting weapon combo to try out, and new challenges to try them out on. The narrator and story presentation tie into this perfectly, keeping the storyline moving at a good stint along with the rest of the game. Bastion isn't a very long game, but it's a very dense experience - there's a lot to take in during that short time period, on all levels.			",300,66,3,37,11,1,45

												7/10 - Charming game, fun combat, rewarding upgrade system, an interesting story and setting, and of course the narration really makes it shine. Not much to say that hasn't already been said. Goes on maybe a bit longer than I'd have liked, and there were a few points here and there that felt either unfairly difficult (some of the challenge arenas basically requiring absolute perfect economy of movement/action) or far easier than the plot would have suggested (most of the major encounters towards the end of the game felt rather inconsequential despite the increasing significance). Still, a great game nonetheless.			",238,94,3,41,34,3,28

												Atmosphere is unbeatable.  Combat is outstanding.  The game has a particular style, which is pulled off excellently by use of locations, graphics, music, narraration, and characters.  Even weapons and combat seem built into the atmosphere.This game was amazingly fun.  The farther you go, the more exciting it gets.  Check out the video on its steam store page, and just imagine playing with that sexy old guy's voice commenting about everything that happens... it's like you're really a part of a story... a kind of legend.I highly recommend this one.

												     I really don't like games where the player or character that you play is tiny and right in the middle of the screen.. But this was - a masterpiece.      The story was breath-taking and really special in its own way. It had many twists and turns that made it even better. Its also pretty fun that you can invoke and idols to make the game more difficult instead of just choosing a mode to play in. All the characters have really unique personalities and histories - which ultimately makes the game even more exciting! Really loved how there are so many weapons and upgrades that you can get to make the Kid better at fighting! (Best weapons I've ever had to use in games)     Bastion's art was fanstastic. The style was very original and cute. The environment was carefully planned as each 'world' or location had character and history. Personally I loved Tazal Terminals and the Bastion :)     Its OST was one of the most unique OSTs I've ever (Soz, can't beat BioShock Infinite's OST - Elizabeth) heard. I really enjoyed how the voice actors got to sing a single song as a theme for each of their characters.Overall, it was one of the best games I played for 2014~! :D:D:D 10/10 because everything XDDPs.

												8/10 - Beautiful game (visually as well as gameplay), really enjoyed it.- Easy in overall difficulty with options to increase difficulty for bonus exp rewards (which can make it quite challenging)- Plenty of balanced weapons that fit vastly different play stylesOne complaint I do have about the game is the way that new weapons and skills are introduced: you receive new weapons in an un-upgraded form and are forced to play with a seemingly under-powered weapon.  After a hard time during the level due to the new weapon, you probably won't take it out for another spin.  This creates a bias for the starting weapons unless you really like to experiment.

												Admittedly, I missed the Bastion hype train when it came chugging past in 2011 and had only ever heard of a brief description of it being 'good' from people around me. How I missed that goodness knows but after playing Bastion I can only say that it completely lives up to the hype around it.In an action RPG hack and slasher, you play as a character simply called The Kid. What unfolds is a story where there is no 'good' or 'bad' but instead a morally grey area for a majority of the characters which leads to some interesting perspectives. The story is told by the narrator who comments and narrates almost everything you do as The Kid. Perhaps people can see this as being a gimmick for the game but I personally found it delightfully charming and enjoyed listening to the commentary as I played. It helps to try the story forward and serves as encouragement if you should get stuck to keep going. The only gripe I have about the story is that I would've liked to have a bit more of it, plus one of the decisions that you're forced to choose at the end doesn't seem to have much of an effect on the end story.Graphically the game is stunning, even living up to the standards of 2014. Seeing the ground rise up around my character as I walked was stunning and helped to keep the pace of the game. Every area has been designed carefully so there's a lot to see and do in a story that is around 5 hours long. The foes you come up against have all had thought put into them and both move and look as I'd imagined.Gameplay-wise the game is clever as it has an almost 'choose your own difficulty' with the shrine settings. By activating more idols  you gain bigger rewards but this in turn makes the game much more difficult. The use of the distillery also allows the player themselves to choose what bonuses they gain from levelling up making it so The Kid is completely customised to the player. The same goes with weapons; a range of melee and ranged weapons drop throughout the game which once again allows the player to play at their preferred style. This isn't something I'm used to seeing in games and it added to my enjoyment.As for the soundtrack... it's honestly one of my favourite soundtracks and I'm someone who doesn't download soundtracks too much. It fits the mood of the game perfectly and  helps to immerse you straight into the world of Bastion. There's not much else I can say but I can guarantee that at the very least you should be able to fall in love with the soundtrack even if the game isn't for yourself.The replay factor varies. I'm not the sort of person who'd play a game more than once yet I found myself playing Bastion for the second time through with the new gamemode I'd unlocked. As it allows you to carry over your stats and weapons from your previous save it makes the game a lot easier which some people may dislike but I enjoyed immensely. The game isn't so long that replaying it feels tedious either!Ultimately I ended up being surprised that this game was made by an indie developer as it's so polished and such a beautiful, engaging game. There's not much I can fault other than one slight disgruntlement with the storyline to be honest. This comes highly recommended if there's anyone else who hasn't played it, even when it's not on sale. If it's on sale... well, there's no excuse to not buy Bastion.			",16,12,0,10,11,0,0

												I'm not going to spend too long talking about this game, now that it's several years old. Check out the gameplay, and if that appeals to you, get it. Opinions follow.Pros:+Good art+Good music+Good sound design+Good gameplay+Pretty good story+Lots of weapons to play with+Training ground for each weapon+Starts out pretty easy but allows you to make it a lot harder if you want a challengeCons:-Kind of short-You get a new weapon like every other stage. Unless you play New Game Plus, you won't have enough levels to play around with all the weapons-Sometimes hard to tell where you will and won't fall off of-Pretty linear with very minimal exploration10/10 it's pretty good.

												Wonderfully written, with an amazing voice actor, and a pretty good weapon system. Bastion is one of those games that just kept me on my toes while I played it. My only downside to the game is it's mini-games used for unlocking upgrades for them. Most of them weren't very fun, and the ones that were turned out to be too easy or short. Other than that, the story and combat for me were really fun, and the shrines made the game more difficult to suite any masochistic needs I had. 8/10			",263,23,3,36,7,2,28

Sound aids in immersion and it is one reason why I watch anime over reading manga. That is really what makes Bastion great.

Bastion is the debut game from independent developer Supergiant Games, and what a debut.  Bastion is an Action Role-Playing Game with beautiful art-style and music. It has an intriguing and different story narrated to you by a Stranger, which is one of the most recognizable features of the game. The gameplay and character's skills are solid, flexible and fun to mess around with. The game lends itself to at least 2 play-through’s with 2 different endings, but such is not mandatory to understand the story. One run should take you around 11 hours with the extra challenges. It has a Metacritic score of 86 (critics) and a 8.6 (users) . Overall, I really liked and had fun with the game, if you like action games and RPG’s I would recommend this game. I also think this could appeal to bullet hell shooter fans, because it has some elements of it although in a smaller scale.My Score: 9/10 ",10,1,0,1,0,0,0

												Quite unique game. The gameplay in itself is not extraordinary, but it's a solid old-school isometric ""run around and shoot/smash stuff""-game, which in itself is pretty rare these days.The special thing about the game is it's really colourfull and special graphics, it's cool music and it's even cooler narator that chronicles your journey from start to finnish. The mood of the game (of which the narator holds a big part in) is like nothing I've ever quite experienced before, and tbh the overall mood is probably it's biggest selling-point in my mind.Considering it's price it's a really great buy, and it's actually quite lenghty too considering it's an indie-game :)			",134,21,0,31,10,1,23

I was instantly enthralled by the beautiful hand-drawn environments and the stunning soundtrack. As the game progressed I fell in love with the characters, the story, and the gameplay.

Bastion is the debut game from independent developer Supergiant Games, and what a debut.  Bastion is an Action Role-Playing Game with beautiful art-style and music. It has an intriguing and different story narrated to you by a Stranger, which is one of the most recognizable features of the game. The gameplay and character's skills are solid, flexible and fun to mess around with. The game lends itself to at least 2 play-through’s with 2 different endings, but such is not mandatory to understand the story. One run should take you around 11 hours with the extra challenges. It has a Metacritic score of 86 (critics) and a 8.6 (users) . Overall, I really liked and had fun with the game, if you like action games and RPG’s I would recommend this game. I also think this could appeal to bullet hell shooter fans, because it has some elements of it although in a smaller scale.My Score: 9/10 ",10,1,0,1,0,0,0

												I was gifted Bastion about one year ago by a friend of mine. I forgot about it until sometime in the beginning of 2014, and I decided to give it a whirl. I was instantly enthralled by the beautiful hand-drawn environments and the stunning soundtrack. As the game progressed I fell in love with the characters, the story, and the gameplay. I have to admit I nearly cried when I realized I had finished the game. An instant classic in my library, I would recommend this amazing game to anybody that I talk to.			",118,12,0,23,9,0,24

												Bastion is beautiful. not only does it have great combat and story, but also ( most importantly) Morgan Freeman narrates it. ( well, it sounds like it at least) All of the wepons seem fluid and fit well, so there's no laser swords or shark launchers, just good ol' hammers, macchetes, and the occasional pistol. You can upgrade your inventory, which is very useful. And aso, this game os very hard, which  i love! The only thing i regret is not playing it alot. PEACE!			",165,27,3,14,11,1,3

Also, it includes the vocal performance of the highly underrated Logan Cunningham. Other suggestions for those who like this game would be the upcoming Hyperlight Drifter, Lunar Knigts on the DS, and the Boktai series on the GBA. Highly reccomended			",92,4,2,11,1,1,3

												Short version: It's a good game with an awesome atmosphere and audio. Honestly it's too good to be an indie game and for it's price I'd definitely recommend buying it especially if it's on sale.What is Bastion? Well for me it was not only a game, but also an experience like Journey, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons and other similar games. An experience that I will always remember.The gameplay is pretty simple: you move around the isometric maps and kill enemies and occasional bosses using a variety of melee and long range weapons. A more interesting twist is that later on you can set difficulty level you want by activating up to ten shrines that give various buffs to your enemies. Playing certain levels with all of the shrines active can be quite challenging. There is also a ""New Game+"" option when you finish the game and since it has multiple ending it can be worth having second playthrough.The visuals are very nice. Each level is beautifully drawn and the level builds up under your feet as you move which makes the overall look even more appealing. The sounds. There are two sides worth mentioning. The music and the Stranger. The music is really good and fits the game great. I'd probably think about buying it if I hadn't gotten it together with Bastion in the Humble Bundle. The Stranger is this games most known feature. He is the narrator that talks about you and your journey with a deep and very nice voice. He is so popular they even made a Bastion announcer for Dota 2.All in all this game will probably leave a lasting memory and is a great experience. I have really enjoyed playing it and it's definitely worth it's price. I would definitely recommend you to try Bastion. You will not regret it. ",191,74,5,23,18,1,12

												I have finished the game in normal mode, so it's time to write a review.If you expect a pure RPG like Runescape, this is not the type, but the graphics, audio, story, combat mechanics and effects are SO GOOD your money will not be wasted.This isn't a difficult game, you'll die once or twice, that's all.If you have time and money, just sit down and relax on some Bastion gameplay.+amazing story+awesome narration+mind-blowing graphics and fluidity+nice combat mechanics-not a ""real"" RPG, may be misleading-not too much freedom out of the story, however the story is very enjoyable-a bit too easy at times, and the save system may be frustrating (you need to finish the area before quitting)This game also has a touch of surrealism I enjoy.

												An absolutely fantastic game.Graphics/Art: Beautiful graphics and art design that really fit the story and help build the atmosphere of the game, overall. I love how the world constructs itself around you as you progress. It's obvious talented and caring hands went into the art and engine design. A right proper blend of steampunk, tribal, final fantasy inspired, and post-apocalyptic art that brings the world to life.Sound: The score, music, and sound effects are all wonderfully done, and really enhance the mood and create the ambience of the game.Gameplay: Simple, yet fun, fluid, and fast. Very rewarding, and no weapon, skill, or tonic feels useless. Allows for a variety of play styles.Story: The story is interesting and compelling, yet not overdone or overtold. They walk well the line between ""less is more"" and too little.Overall: Get this game and play it. It's fantastic, and definitely greater than the sum of its very excellent parts.

												Fight to restore the bastion to its former self... or not.This is a great little game worth its price, which is best enjoyed in short bursts of gameplay, half hour here and there. 1 playthrough ( for me ) rounded out to be a bit over 4 hours, but due to some unlocks and decision making towards the end of the game, it easily offers more than one playthrough. ( which is more than what i can say for other, cash cow, $60 games... )The narration itself really made this game stand out to me, story-telling with a twist, and quite the.. attractive voice. which is pretty much icing on the cake. ( but hey if you dont like it, you can turn it off. dont let it deture you from the game, but it certainly is quite a big part of the game itself. )There are also the occasional catchy tune that pops up from time to time, which really helps set the mood for the levels as well. thinking of getting the album, truthfully. if you like a game to kick back too, deff give this a look			",85,20,4,9,11,0,6

												The Kid and I introduce ourselves in kind. Both to him…and to each other, for the first time.Bastion is an Indie RPG with great artwork, heartbreaking story and amazing soundtrack. In the game you play as The Kid, young hero who tries to restore the bastion to its full potential. While you play, you discover different areas, different weapons and upgrade bonuses (spirits) and you customize your loadout the way you want it. For more hardcore gamers there are also challenges for each weapon and survival (Who Knows Where) mode which makes this relatively short game a little bit longer.I highly recommend this game for everybody.... I'll see you in the next one ...			",166,29,3,10,13,1,45

""You gotta hand it to the Calamity, it did the job quick"" ~ Narrator RucksWith out a doubt this is one of the most enjoyable games I have had the pleasure to play.The world of Bastion has a colourful, unique and mysterious look with a gorgeous graphic style.  You traverse this world as ""The Kid"" with the ground literally rising up to meet you as you explore each level.  While navigating your way through unknown paths you encounter a variety of enemies to fight with a variety of unlock-able weapons.  Each weapon can also be customised with multiple upgradeable with an assortment of affects.  To cap this off the combat system itself is smooth, responsive and a lot of fun to use.  One of the greatest strengths of this game however is the story.  Not only is the storyline engaging, with fragments of side information to fill out the world and give it depth, but the narration is brilliantly scripted and voiced.  Not only that but the narrator reacts to what you do in the game, my personal favourite occurring after smashing several in game breakables ""The Kid just rages for a while.""  Behind all of this throughout is an excellent soundtrack that really ties the whole game together.tl;dr (summary)pros great graphic style enjoyable combat multiple weapon options good soundtrack excellent narrationcons linear storyline ",68,27,0,17,8,0,17

												Bastion is beautiful. not only does it have great combat and story, but also ( most importantly) Morgan Freeman narrates it. ( well, it sounds like it at least) All of the wepons seem fluid and fit well, so there's no laser swords or shark launchers, just good ol' hammers, macchetes, and the occasional pistol. You can upgrade your inventory, which is very useful. And aso, this game os very hard, which  i love! The only thing i regret is not playing it alot. PEACE!			",165,27,3,14,11,1,3

												Bastion is a strange game best known for it's narrator which is more like a commentator but is done so well that you never get annoyed by him repeating itself.The art is amazing as the ground raises from the bottom of the screen so you can walk on which makes exploring and finding secrets very rewarding. The general appearance of the levels and characters is very well done and thought out. Though I diddnt like the isometric type of view I wasnt punished by falling off the edge with a loss of life, the isometric view gives you the gods eye view which obviously works well with the narrator.The combat got repetitive but it was challenging you are able to block and use melee and ranged weapons. There are multiple weapons and you are able to customize your character even to suit the style you want such as using an arrow and a blunderbuss or 2 different melee weapons, or the 1 melee weapon and 1 ranged weapon. But you will always have a shield in Bastion which does resemble an old shoot em up at times.Bastion has a lot of life with it's replayability, the god shrine is a great idea, letting the enemy get stronger and getting more experience is a great idea. I finished the game and was given the option to play through it again but with all the unlocks available so its a great game for the completionists out there.Though I do believe it is overrated just a bit it obviously gets a lot of attention because of the narrator. If you like a challenge and good game design play! ",191,16,2,11,20,1,10

												Really fun adventure game that follows a boy through a devastated land where he needs to explore and fight while trying to save what's left.+ Cool isometric perspective gameplay.+ Responsive and accurate controls (I personally would recommend using a gamepad).+ Wide variety of weapons, perks and upgrades that totally change the way you play and fight.+ Excellent voice acting that helps driving a pretty good storyline.+ Beautiful environments, characters and enemies.+ Really nice replay value, since you can keep your upgraded weapons and face the story and new challenges with them.+ Godlike soundtrack (like, seriously, buy it if you can).

												""Proper story 'sposed to start at the beginning. This one ain't so simple""Bastion's brilliance is in the way it's story is told; through dynamic narration. As you fight to rebuild the world following ""The Calamity"" your actions, choices, and even style of play are accompanied by only some of the thousands of lines of dialouge that tell the tale without ever taking you out of the moment. The gameplay is perfectly balanced for customization and is the closest thing I've seen to a good ol' fashioned Super Nintendo title since it's heyday. It also features one of the greatest soundtracks ever produced. Bastion would be an accomplishment for a large studio, but for the independant artists at Supergiant it is so much more - It is everything right about modern gaming.			",172,37,4,19,8,0,12

												9.4/10. If you're looking for a game with the most complex fighting system in gaming, this isn't your game. If you're looking for anything else, then this game goes above and beyond any other indie game I've played. The gameplay is smooth and leaves you wishing you had paused to smash that last box. The narration, which I expected to be annoying and immersion inhibiting, was one of the greatest aspects of the game, and in fact made me feel more like I was a part of the story than anything else. Speaking of the story, this is one of the greatest game plots I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. No spoilers, but I genuinely had to consider the choice at the end for a minute or so. And of course, I can't talk about Bastion without mentioning the music. The song placement is powerful, and I never once felt annoyed with the overuse of a particular melody. The soundtrack itself is phenomenal as well.tl;dr: Great game. Amazing story. Narrator one bar under Morgan Freeman. Awesome music. Buy it now.			",46,5,1,10,10,0,15

												By this point Bastion doesn't need another positive review to solidify its standing as a must have game. With only the most bitter and caustic contrarians providing negative feedback, Bastion has an approval rate of 98%. That should speak highly of the game's value but one should always strive to understand what makes something good rather than blindly following popular opinion like one more lemming in the heard and indeed one should highlight the strengths of a thing rather than simply using popular opinion to define something's value. Rest assured however, in this case, Bastion is one cliff you'll be happy to jump off of with the rest of us.Bastion begins with a young child waking up to find his world falling apart, literally. An ominous and mysterious disaster, referred to as the Calamity, has caused the fabric of the world to collapse. Finding that only he and one other person survived, the boy must recollect the essence of the world and rebuild it. Narrated by one of the best voices on planet Earth, the boy's journey takes him through the ruins of a deep and interesting setting. Indeed Bastion has one of the most unique settings in video games, its indie origins contributing to the bravery of doing something new and interesting. The game is fairly short admittedly and to discuss too much of the plot would be to give it away but trust me in that it doesn't disappoint.Mechanically the game is remarkably solid. The purpose of collecting the shards and mcguffins is to upgrade both your base and character. There are a wide variety of weapons and enough distinction between bonuses and weapons to fit a wide variety of play styles. Being of a short length, the difficulty ramps up quickly and you must choose which upgrades are most valuable to your play style. Committing is the crux of the matter as your investments need to pay off to complete later levels.With story and mechanics blended this well, I never stopped feeling engaged. My drive maintained from start to finish which is tougher that one might think. Bastion walks a very fine line with not having any lulls in the action while at the same time not being overwhelming about it. My final analysis: Buy this game. It is great.			",157,54,1,10,8,0,11

I finally got around to playing it and absolutely loved it. The graphics and soundtrack are perfect. The way the story is told is really awesome and fairly unique. It's not a very long game (I think it took me about 4 hours to finish it). Towards the end of the game I started to feel like it was a bit repetitive, but never once did I want to stop playing. The game is an absolute must-play and is a truly wonderful experience.			",258,49,4,40,29,3,31

												Bastion is a hack’n’slay-kind of game, with some rpg elements like upgrading weapons and very light leveling.It takes place in Caelondia, a city devastated and broken into pieces by a catastrophy called the Calamity. You play as the Kid, trying to fix your world, meeting other survivors and fighting the creatures now inhabiting the other floating parts of the city.  Why I like this game: The Story is great, as is the narration The graphics are marvelous The soundtrack by Darren Korb is just fantastic, emphasizing the atmosphere. You can upgrade your weapons with stuff you find in the city and its surroundings Try to master all weapons on the proving grounds Have I mentioned, that the music is great? Well, it is.I found the controls to be a bit tricky, but otherwise I really enjoyed playing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you like a good soundtrack, character customization, art style and narration then you’ll be loving every second Bastion has to offer. Bastion is an hack and slash action RPG that combines an amazing art style with an even more amazing soundtrack. The combat and movement feels smooth and unique. There is a variety of different weapons that allows you to fight enemies the way you want. One of the best things about Bastion is the freshness of the game, there aren't many games that are able to pull of an amazing art style, soundtrack, narration and combat all at the same time. The scenery never gets boring and is alway changing with lots of minor details. One of the ways they do this is by having the ground around you form as you walk near it. This can help keep people with low attention spans to keep engaged with the game.The constant improvements to your character and weapons gives a lot more replayability to the game. Leveling up allows you to quipt a buffing effect called a ‘spirit’ to your character. Weapons can be upgraded through finding materials when exploring the world. Idols make the game harder in certain aspects and are used to give the player more of a challenge, this helps give the game more replayability. The hack and slash gameplay is well made with lots of different ways to defeat your enemies. Upgrading weapons was very satisfying and fun to do. Bastion's soundtrack is very good and interesting and can be what keeps some people playing the game. The art style is also very unique and fitting with the soundtrack.One of the cons the game has (And it’s hard to come across cons in Bastion) is that the hack and slash gameplay at times can get a little repetitive. It’s also lacking in a filled in story, for example It doesn’t talk about what the world was like before the calamity, leaving the world feeling a bit empty at times. The story missions are basic and revolve around collecting one sort of object for almost every mission. But these don’t make Bastion a bad game, far from it. These are just little things I found when playing Bastion other people might and probably do disagree with.On average Bastion takes around six and a half hours to complete the story, while to complete the story and all extras takes around twenty hours. Bastion keeps the story nice and short for players looking for a short and sweet experience, while giving the game a good amount of completion hours for those wanting to spend a good extra fifteen or so hours on the game. With this and everything I’ve covered I’d recommend this game to anyone who loves good hack and slash mechanics, art and soundtrack in the games they play. I think It’s well worth the full price of fifteen dollars, but if you find it on sale it’s a must buy.			",175,40,3,31,12,0,10

												Bastion is mainly an action-RPG putting you in the role of a kid (The Kid) trying to survive in a land torn apart by a cataclysm and rebuilding what is left of his homeland.Bastion's gameplay is quite simple, and allows you to customize your weapons, passive abilities and even some debuff that award you with more experience at the exchange of higer risksThe main highlight of Bastion is a narrator that follows every step of yours, commenting on the most recent developments and your choices in weaponry and skills, among other things. It's far more limited than you could expect, but he's a charming addition nevertheless.The gameplay will get more and more challenging as you progress. The real difficulty however comes with various side-quests, like different kind of arenas of weapons' tests.All in all, Bastion is a charming indie title, handy to play and with a more than worthy story, artistic direction, soundtrack			",143,41,0,17,0,2,8

												I highly recommend Bastion because of its great gameplay and music. First of all the music never gets old and whenever you hear it you'll probably end up humming or singing along to it. Second, the game has a great storyline and can be played over and over again. This game is unique to all other games and you should buy it on sale or not!			",73,21,1,14,10,0,5

												I have only played a couple hours so far, but very enjoyable if you like hack and slash rpg games. The world is created from beautiful watercolor images, what beauty and artistry. With an array of weapons at your disposal as well as weapon leveling customization that you, the player chooses, sets a precedent in more ways than one. The different areas you travel to are all beautiful works of art, and the land builds as you walk. Very nice touch. Great job developers, but with your numerous awards, you are well aware of your success. A great game. Also love the narrator who comments on your every move and action.			",32,9,0,13,2,0,4

												A brilliant story to get lost in.The vaguely Zen-like and mysterious atmosphere will keep you spellbound until the end - I was transported back to the days of being a kid playing Super Mario 3 and The Legend of Zelda on the NES way back when - not from a gameplay perspective, but in the sense that my imagination was utterly captured from start to finish. Through the game's music, its gradual explanatory narrative and the colorful, dream-scape art direction used in creating the enviroments and everything in them - this pervading sense of sadness and loss creeps in on your psyche and leaves a lasting impression.Then it does one better:Many games have allowed me to exist in a post cataclysmic world - few, if any, have made me care about understanding why and how the world ended. Levels assemble themselves from nothingness as you walk through them, and the narrative stitches places, people and events of old together into a grand tapestry. It takes time to begin to make sense. Your actions, while pre-determined in most cases, feel as if they have real weight and truly affect the future of everyone involved with your character.You play as 'The Kid'- an apt bit of vaguness that, through the fact that the protagonist utters nary a word out loud throughout the entire ordeal and all of his decisions made in game are in the player's hands, make the game a very personal experience. At no point did I feel like I was simply along for the ride. Without trying to give too much away, in Bastion you will eventually have to make your mind up and act on a very philosophically 'grey' course of action. There is none of the clear cut 'Hero or Villain of the Wastelands' duality going on here - both outcomes are potentially horrifying when thought about.The game is beautiful in a classical sense. It's isometric, with detailed backdrops all having a 'hand-crafted' feel - every level looks like it would be right at home painted on a canvas and hung above someone's fireplace. The music deserves an honorable mention as well. While it ticks all the right boxes, being wonderfully produced and ranging from up-beat and inspiring to melancholy and nostalgic, it is, through and through, just wonderful to listen to and completely suited to what you see on-screen. From experience, many devs do not seem to have a terribly hard time tying a soundtrack and visual elements together into something that 'works'. Sometimes, though, a title comes along and you just know that without that specific soundtrack that seems to reflect the involved themes so intrinsically, the game itself would have only been half the experience. Off the top of my head, Soul Reaver and the first Unreal are good examples of this.At the most basic level, it controls similarly to an ARPG akin to Diablo and Torchlight, but it stands completely apart from titles like these in its style and execution. Nox would be a closer comparison - less focus on stats and combat and more on the experience of existing in another world (I miss you, Westwood). You gain access to a few, upgradeable weapons, but at no point does that seem to be the focus. They are each fun and unique- no endless slew of samey implements with rainbow themed tiers of quality. Sorry grinders. Story and experience are what is important here. Personally speaking, I feel the greatest value of Bastion is in what your mind takes away from it. If you have any capacity for empathy, I can almost guarantee that you will dwell on everything that happened well after the credits have rolled.Highly, HIGHLY recommended if you enjoy your gaming to be more than the endless rinse and repeat of 'clicky clicky, blood and different colored items'.

												This was the debut release from SuperGiant Games, and judging by the quality of this game alone they're certainly ones to watch in the future.Gameplay-wise, this is excellent. Lots of variance in weapons, upgrades don't feel simply tacked-on and there's a lot of skill involved, especially if you want to activate the optional idols to increase the difficulty (and the rewards). From what I have seen, having all idols on makes the game nearly impossible. A very exciting prospect indeed for the truly masochistic. Bastion is pretty short. But oh-so-worth it. I won't spoil the story, but towards the end, there are some rather dire choices to be made. And this game's ending is bloody heart-wrenching. I very nearly cried manly, manly tears. And it will make you want to replay this game. And I am confused as to why I haven't yet.			",56,11,6,8,0,1,7

												I really enjoyed this one: the artwork is really beautiful (though the graphics are isometric, which means you're gonna fall a few times off the gorgeous watercolored landscapes, just be warned), the soundtrack is impressive and the narrator that guides you and keeps you company through the game is a tough-but-charming dude you would want to meet in real life.The main plot could seem kinda thin because you spend most of the time fighting cute critters while the narrator makes nostalgic comments about the way the world used to be before the Calamity, but oddly enough they managed to build a emotional story with an amazing ending despite all the time you spend killing things with a machete and a cannon.Actually I was expecting to like this game just because of the artwork and the apocalyptic storyline, but I was quite happy to discover that there're a lot of fun weapons and special attacks you can combine to try different battle styles in the challenging arenas. So a wonderful game all around.Make yourself a favour and buy it :D			",34,29,0,11,2,1,3

												Very few games that I've played in my life come close to this level of storytelling. The characters and the plot are both interesting; and both of these elements get tied together with a fantastic atmosphere. Bastion presents you with a world that can easily suck you in. Combine that with gameplay that is solid and just plain fun; and I struggle to call it anything other than masterful. The game seems simple in terms of gamplay, but flexible enough to allow changes in colors and visual effects; which heavily influence the feel of the game.The content offered within the game is admirable to say the least. Bastion is smart enough to vary the gameplay a lot, so that no one thing is relied upon for the duration of the game. So, as you play, you get more things to keep you occupied. Special challenges help you with understanding different weapons. Upgrades and powerups create a very satisfying feeling of progression as the game goes on. There's just so much packed into this quaint looking game.I can hardly say a bad thing about Bastion. It's something that takes a degree of investment in, sure, but its easily worth the payoff. Just thinking about the amount of work that went into this game, to make it this immersive and intricate, makes me amazed; and I can't say that for all but the most well crafted video games.

												Bastion is a hack’n’slay-kind of game, with some rpg elements like upgrading weapons and very light leveling.It takes place in Caelondia, a city devastated and broken into pieces by a catastrophy called the Calamity. You play as the Kid, trying to fix your world, meeting other survivors and fighting the creatures now inhabiting the other floating parts of the city.  Why I like this game: The Story is great, as is the narration The graphics are marvelous The soundtrack by Darren Korb is just fantastic, emphasizing the atmosphere. You can upgrade your weapons with stuff you find in the city and its surroundings Try to master all weapons on the proving grounds Have I mentioned, that the music is great? Well, it is.I found the controls to be a bit tricky, but otherwise I really enjoyed playing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a game that people often praise. But completely for the wrong reasons. They might mention some sort of narration, maybe emotional climaxes and beautiful artwork. They would be right to do so. But what really makes this game recommendable for me is the fact that it does not let all of that vision stop them from producing excellent core mechanics. Every upgrade, every button press, every Weapon, God and Liquor all work in synchronicity and in a controlled way that allow you to grasp the game and master the world, the way you choose.Sure, you might not like the narrator, but you will love the challenge. And it doesn't hurt that it's pretty, compelling and emotionally driven.			",98,9,0,11,5,0,20

I finally got around to playing it and absolutely loved it. The graphics and soundtrack are perfect. The way the story is told is really awesome and fairly unique. It's not a very long game (I think it took me about 4 hours to finish it). Towards the end of the game I started to feel like it was a bit repetitive, but never once did I want to stop playing.

												The Kid and I introduce ourselves in kind. Both to him…and to each other, for the first time.Bastion is an Indie RPG with great artwork, heartbreaking story and amazing soundtrack. In the game you play as The Kid, young hero who tries to restore the bastion to its full potential. While you play, you discover different areas, different weapons and upgrade bonuses (spirits) and you customize your loadout the way you want it. For more hardcore gamers there are also challenges for each weapon and survival (Who Knows Where) mode which makes this relatively short game a little bit longer.I highly recommend this game for everybody.... I'll see you in the next one ...			",166,29,3,10,13,1,45

												Beautifull clever richly detailed and surprisingly immersive what with the initial bare bones impression. Lovingly crafted sound effects and music complete your journey to never wanting to finish the blessed thing. Which is not a problem. Play her through a second times (slight differences and difficulty settings) and your new favourite voice of the narrator can be heard saying ""Well that didnt happen last time...did it?"".Highly recommended. Combat is easily grasped and the difficulty slide can frustrate you to tears or have you merrilly strolling along just enjoying the crafty settings and unique creatures. The reality created for the storyline is reminiscant in its depth and subtle hints to ancient civilizations and beings never seen before of The Rings, but has an awesome uniqueness to it. Humour abounds in just the correct quantities to not cheapen the entire experience and quite frankly a sequel would surprise me as they've down EVERYTHING in here already....Buy it, borrow it, drool on it or dream for it but don't pirate this one because this Studio deserve every penny.

He looks at me, and I nod in approval to let him continue talking while he types what's intresting about the '""active narrating"" doo-hickey. He says how ""cool"" it is to hear  a person say what you're doing in a game and actively comments; and that it immerses the player into the world. I don't understand a word of it, but I continue nodding.He then starts recounting about the times he played the game, about the ""Calamity"". He talks about waking up, floating in the sky in the middle of nowhere. Then something about a hammer. He starts listing all the types of weapons you get as you play, a machete. Rifle, Mortar, Shotgun, Pistol, Revolver, a Bow and Arrow. Even a flamethrower. He then lists all the monsters. Gasbags, Slimes, Crows, something about a Queen. All pretty interesting, but to a different man.+Kid talks about the ""active narrating"" again, saying how good it is+Then he says the controls are easy to learn,+""People with different playstyles will love it"", he says+From what I've heard from the kid, the game's story is the best he's ever doneWatchin' his smile fade to a frown, he starts to complain-""Too easy"", says the kid.

												This game sets the standard for Indie games. Simple as that. Its a piece of art with an incredible narrative that distances itself from anything else youve probably ever played. You have to play it to understand; if you love games, you will love this. It does everything right. Will be buying Transistor as soon as I can.So glad to see this new review section as games like this can be ignored somewhat.			",178,14,3,5,5,2,7

You will plunge into the beautiful designed world of Bastion, trying to piece together what was once known as your home.  Intuitive and simple yet challenging to engage all forms of audiences.  If you're in it for the visuals, the music, the gameplay, or just something else.  This game has it all.			",170,30,4,26,10,3,18

												Bastion is yet another example of games where the gameplay itself is only a secondary part of the experience. Hacking and slashing through hordes of repetitive creatures in an isometric 3D environment would've been quite dull, weren't for the appealing art style, the always present and distinguishing voice-over narration, and the excellent soundtrack. The story, while supported by an interesting lore that can be seen reflected throughout the art of the game, doesn't get really interesting until it's final third, concluding in a very satisfatory ending. Although a console port, Bastion works well with a keyboard/mouse setup and didn't present any technical issues whatsoever. A great - and quite short - game, definitely worth experiencing.

												How do you turn a video game from being just entertainment, into an experience? Whatever the answer, Bastion nails it.Rather than being just a clever hack 'n' slash, run 'n' gun game, Bastion kicks it up a notch with an amazing soundtrack and a brilliantly written narrative. The story never stops the gameplay: it's delivered as you play, commenting on how well you're doing as you go. You'll lose yourself in the experience.If you like what you hear, watch the trailer. Now imagine that trailer for the rest of the game.			",35,2,1,0,1,1,1

												I just completed this game and other than that familiar sense of accomplishment I'm delighted with the experience.The game caught me since the first 2 minutes with a narrative that makes you look around wherever you are playing and ask ""are they talking to me?""The visuals are outstanding, fluent and vibrant. I fell a few times at the beginning (and accross the game I must confess) because I was distracted with all the details. Eventhou you can get used to the fight mechanics, the game puts a few surprises specially with the very last weapon.This is not a game to be creative regarding decisions and follow your own path but is flexible regarding how you walk that path now and then.After completing it I will give it a second try since lets you decide the way that you want to make the game more difficult (enemies with more endurance or speed, resources limitation, etc) and I can just imagine the pain that will be with all the challenges enabled.I give it a 9/10			",60,13,0,3,0,0,1

												Have you ever played a game where you just wanted to play it because you wanted to listen to the pretty? If you haven't then you should play Bastion. The narrator is like earsex. Morgan Freeman wishes he had this voice.Also, on the game's merits, I was surprised. No other game has had such varied one button gameplay. The weapons actually all play differently. Combine that with the fact that you can carry 2 weapons at a time and you've got incredible amounts of flexibility in how you want to play your game.Solid ARPG stacked with an interesting story, beautiful voice acting, and plenty of play style flexibility makes this game a must buy. Plus, it can even be played in the chrome browser now. What is this technology madness?Well worth the 15$, and if you're poor grab it on a sale. If you don't want to wait I'll even spot you a 5.

												Great little game, what is there more to sayI liked the soundtracks very muchI hope they'll get it on sale sometime (wasn't on sale at the same time as the game)The narration feels pretty unique to me and rather good, I loved how the narrator comments on almost every single action making me feel like it's really my own story (he will comment differently based on your results and the little choices you make (even if in the end there is not much game altering choices that I know of so far but I have not finished the game yet)I always feel compounded to get back to it and improve my bastion a little more.I love the fact that you can dynamically alter the difficulty for more rewards, while it shortens some of the grinding,  the increased challenge is not something to be laughed at. Some upgrade path are not always straight damage/resistance increases or instead requires specific conditions which in my humble opinion makes the game more interesting.My only regret would be that there is an optional built-in autoaim which is almost required for some challenges (at least it sure feels like it was balanced for players to use it and abuse it ",95,11,4,9,6,0,7

												Wow. Isometric and *gorgeous* in every sense of the word. Bastion hits every note on an artistic standpoint, nevermind the flaws action combat. It's only flaw may be the slow momentum that it begins with, but it feels like a rolling start to an epic adventure as such adventures go.The deep voice of the narrator guides your entire adventure with trolling quips, anecdots, and hints all in a snippy but fatherly manner. I couldn't wait for all the different weapons to start showing up: the whole world to expanded. Plenty here for one of the best Indy titles I've played to date.			",259,45,2,29,19,1,47

												Bastion is a hack’n’slay-kind of game, with some rpg elements like upgrading weapons and very light leveling.It takes place in Caelondia, a city devastated and broken into pieces by a catastrophy called the Calamity. You play as the Kid, trying to fix your world, meeting other survivors and fighting the creatures now inhabiting the other floating parts of the city.  Why I like this game: The Story is great, as is the narration The graphics are marvelous The soundtrack by Darren Korb is just fantastic, emphasizing the atmosphere. You can upgrade your weapons with stuff you find in the city and its surroundings Try to master all weapons on the proving grounds Have I mentioned, that the music is great? Well, it is.I found the controls to be a bit tricky, but otherwise I really enjoyed playing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I finally got around to playing it and absolutely loved it. The graphics and soundtrack are perfect. The way the story is told is really awesome and fairly unique. It's not a very long game (I think it took me about 4 hours to finish it). Towards the end of the game I started to feel like it was a bit repetitive, but never once did I want to stop playing. The game is an absolute must-play and is a truly wonderful experience.			",258,49,4,40,29,3,31

												This game was a game I bought on sale without expecting much. I tought the design looked pretty enough and randomly decided to give it a try. I did not regret it. I can safely say that this game is well worth its full price.It is, for one, absolutely beautiful. The details and colors are awfully pleasing to look at, the voice acting never gets old & does an amazing job of getting you into the story and, most of all, the soundtrack is breathtaking. It has been a long while since the last time I wanted to buy a soundtrack so badly. The story is well paced and makes the most of small cast of endearing characters. The twists, although mostly easy to predict, are paced in a way that keeps the story compelling and interesting. I could not help but get attached. There is also some replayability to the game as it has multiple endings. Finishing the game once means that you have the option to start over and keep all the weapons etc. that you got the first time around.The game in itself is not too hard and offers you a nice system to up the challenge should you desire it. As you play the first time around, you collect various idols, each bearing its own difficulty, that you can activate to pepper things up. The achievements are also quite fun to get. Anyway, this game is a gem. Getitgetitgetit. You won't regret it. ❤			",25,35,0,17,5,0,1

												Great game. The art is stunning. When playing this I was sucked into the story like it was my own. Loved the narration and how it was used. Loved the way the path fell down from the sky right before your eyes. And the best of all I liked the soundtrack, it was nice and calming when needed, but picked up the pace near for example boss fights. The story is very deep and the Kid's backstory is explained in the Stanger's dream I believe. There is some replayability and gets you hooked. The only downside is that the story is very short. I finished the game in 6 hours, and I wasn't all that fast.This game is certainly worth the full price, but on sale I can't recommend it enough. Be sure to pick this game up.			",290,61,8,49,52,4,53

												This is a nice little hack and slash rpg game thats not like many games you've played. You play as a kid trying to revive his home, The Bastion. He has to travel around to other areas looking for cores to bring back his home to life and build building to improve it. Each time you collect a core from an area you get to upgrade the Bastion. The game has a nice narative to the story and its easy to pick up and play. In some areas the ground appears as you walk and some it falls appart. This makes the game interesting and fun. As you progress in the story and open new lands to explore you will find items that allow you to upgrade your weapons and find new abilities. This a fun little game and I highly recommend it.8/10			",331,70,13,35,21,6,23

												Bastion is a game set in a post apocalyptic world. You take controll over ""the kid"", whos live is being narrated by a mysterious man. The thing that makes this game unique is the way the world forms around you, when walking tiles of the world drop down sometimes creating unexpected passages. The gameplay is smooth and simple, a basic top down shooter with a lot of variety in weapons. You can equip yourself with a melee weapon, a ranged weapon and a series of drinks that give certain boosts.On ""the Bastion"", the homebase, is a shrine located. In this shrine you can activate different god statues which will make the game more difficult in certain ways, making for a lot of replay value. The stroy of Bastion isn't very indepth, you do get to make your own decisions, but this only occures twice at the very end of the game and has barely any influence on the story.But this game wasn't designed for it's story but for it's gameplay and that is absolutely fenominal, so I highly recommend picking this game up.

												Bastion is a short game. It really only took me about 6 hours to go through every level and do moderately well at the challanges and achievements.While normally this is a problem for me because I like to get a lot of time out of my games as I'm pretty stingy when it comes to buying games, but it wasn't.Bastion took me for a ride I never expected. With an intriguing post-apocolyptic/ frontier theme, Bastion packs gameplay, story and asthetics all into one neat package that doesn't drag on spoiling the games like many other longer games might. All in all, Bastion is well worth the money and time it costs.I hesitate to call Bastion a masterpiece as that is not lightly given, but regardless, Bastion was masterfully done and I enjoyed every moment of it.

												One of my all time favourite games. I've played through it probably around 6 or so times (mostly on xbox 360 back in the day which explains my low play time here) and would recommend it to anybody and everybody. Seriously, you can't go wrong.Pros:-  Soundtrack.  One of the best, if not my favourite, soundtracks to any game I have played to date. I often come back to listen to it while playing other games, studying or just relaxing (I may or may not be listening to it as I type this).-  Story.  A very unique and amazing storytelling experience. Something you will remember for quite a time after playing.  Choosing to save Zulf and having ""Setting Sail, Coming Home"" playing in the background. The feels get me every time. -  Gameplay.  A variety of weapons, weapon uprgades, skills, tonics (perks) allowing you to play in many different ways.-  Graphics.  Pleasing artstyle that suits the game well.Neutral:-  Length.  Only a 5-6 hour story. Though it doesn't feel dragged out or too short. It's a good length for what it is, though it may leave some wanting more.-  Replayability.  There's pretty much only the main story and a few side challenges you can do. You can't go back to story areas after completing them. Though, there is a new game+ and score attack mode to keep things a little fresh after completing the game once and idols to modify the difficulty of the game if you want a challenge.Cons:- What is it bad for?  Absolutely nothing!  SAY IT AGAIN.			",189,48,7,29,34,4,58

												If I could give you a computer with Bastion installed, start the game up, and tell you to sit there and play it, I would have a much easier time explaining why this game is truly amazing.Gameplay: 9/10The gameplay is truly great, especially as far as an indie game goes. With fluid movement and skill based fights, the simple block, roll and hit gameplay is perfectly done.Level Design: 10/10Every single pixel of each level is truly a sight to behold, with the world around you forming as you walk along it, the colour and general feel of the levels sets the scene for the game flawlessly. Each part of the world has its own gimick, making each step you take an adventure in itself. I was simply entranced by this beautiful world.Music: 10/10If I could put a rating above 10/10 for this, I would in a heartbeat. Bastion uses it's music in a masterful way, where the placement and soundtrack itself if phenomenal. A simple song in the right place at the right time adds a powerful amount of emotion and feeling to parts of the baron world.Story: 10/10This is the part that makes Bastion truly magnificent. The story itself is not the real winner, but the way the story is unraveled. As the first words are spoken ""Proper story's supposed to start at the beginning, ain't so simple with this one."" The story is told by one man, the narrator. The main character's name is unknown, and you are playing as him as you follow the narrators story. The narrator slowly reveals everything that needs to be revealed, as if he is reading a book of a time that has already passed.Characters: 9/10The characters are never heard, but just talked about by the narrator. The characters personalities are not extremely apparent, but each one becomes special to you over time, as they are the only ones you have to share Bastion's shaken world with.Overview:Bastion is special. The soundtrack is phenomenal, the world is breathtaking, and the narration is a brilliant new idea for gaming. Finding a new enemy in a normal hack-and-slash is an uneventful affair – you kill it and move on. But in Bastion, the entire battle with Sir Lunky – a giant, colorful frog with a stone-covered head– is narrated and given soul. By the time he’s dead you know more about him than most game characters, connecting you to the world. Nearly every moment of the game is like this, continuously reinforcing your attachment to the game. You’ll be cheating yourself if you skip Bastion			",222,39,7,18,24,3,20

												Boy started up this game.  He knew it was good, but he didn't know what he was getting into.  Inside was a colorful world, a world that hid its sinister side.  Hid it so well the kid was sucked in.  Then the world beat that boy to a pulp.  And he loved every moment of it.  Eventually the kid found a shotgun, and the tables were turned.  He tore his path through the world, reached out and ripped the beating heart of fun from the world.  And I'll be darned if it wasn't the most fun that little boy did ever see.

												The thing I like the most about Bastion is how Supergiant Games managed to tell a story that allows room for interpretation while still being able to provide the player with a solid understanding of what happened, combining flowy gameplay, nice artwork and a soundtrack worth listening to even outside of the game. Another spot-on aspect of Bastion is that you can tweak a few things such as passive abilities and weapon sets to suit your playing style; plus, there are several different playing modes, so even if you're having a second go at it, depending on your approach, you can get a different vibe from the game. If you decide to play it, bear in mind that it's a short game, but it's rich in content nonetheless.			",43,5,1,3,1,0,0

												Cool little action RPG with a unique setting which is a little bit steampunk, a little bit Western, a little bit sci-fi fantasy, but which has a flavour all its own. The dynamic narration and the way the game world literally appears just before you as you move are also really cool storytelling ideas, given that the game's narrative conceit is that what is unfolding is the player avatar's story as retold to another person. Also cool gameplay, controls, equip/levelling system etc it's a little bit like a Diablo or Torchlight which requires actual skill. Also it has maybe the best score I've ever heard in a game, definitely a few of the best individual songs. You should probably get it.			",106,20,0,11,7,1,17

												In short: Bastion rekindled my love of games. Don't get me wrong: I've always loved games. But, Bastion was so well crafted, it played like an homage that combined the best aspects of platformer-type games, story-based games, and experimental games.The platformer aspect is solid:while it's not quite a run & jump, the level itself is still a mobile obstacle that must be considered during play. The story of the game is touching and interesting, and keeps a player that cares about said story on their toes, and possibly reaching for a box of tissues. It's hard to pull off a sympathetic villain and morally ambiguous hero in any story, but I find it's even harder to do in games, where the player (as the protagonist) is putting in tons of time and energy to work against the ""villain."" The experiemental bit was the Narrator. Cunningham's narration may be a fixture now, but when the game was released there were a TON of people who thought that it would never work. For most, though, those fears disappeared when his rich voice started, and you always wanted to hear more of what he had to say.Supergiant Games have released just two games so far, but each of them have been gems. Bastion set them on the stage in a big way, and as their fans look forward to Pyre and beyond, it's good to recognize the game that brought the studio to us in the first place.			",75,55,0,30,1,2,21

												It's all about the presentation, and it's amazing. The sound design is incredible (the soundtrack is spot on, and the narrator is legendary); the visuals are spot on: the world falls in place and collapses all around the main characters as he moves, mimicking the main theme of the game. I've been singing the main theme song for years after playing for the first time.Main game is 6-8 hours long, with a few extra stages focused on specific weapons. The game, however, can be replayed using different equipment combinations and, most of all, activating specific conditions to make the game harder (enemies don't drop potions, character is slowed after taking damage...).A must have, even if isometric brawlers are not your favorite genre.

												Bastion is a really compelling and very memorable top-down action/RPG with lots of heart. It has a unique tone, great music, and style to spare. It isn’t perfect by any means – the combat is slightly awkward at times and there are a few other mechanics and features that aren’t great - but the pros outweigh the cons, in my opinion. Long story short, I’d say that when it comes to art style, mood, music, and so on, the game is a strong A, while the actual mechanics are a B. Ultimately, I think that the game is stronger than its individual faults, and that the whole project as a sum package is captivating and really worth playing. If you like adventure games and retro stuff, I’d recommend Bastion in a heartbeat.+ The art style is fantastic. You know when you see great concept art for a game, and then the actual in-game graphics don’t even begin to capture that concept art? Bastion is the rare case where the in-game graphics actually achieve a large part of the wonder, scale, and mood shown in its concept art. The imagery will definitely make people stop and say, ""Whoa, what are you playing?"" The mission maps are filled with lots of lovingly-rendered clutter and little details, and the character designs run along this really interesting thin line between being cute and charming but also kind of rugged and tough. The visual tone does a great job of setting the mood...a little sad, a little lonely, a little dangerous. It's just an all-around striking and oftentimes stunning visual package.+ The story is actually quite solid. It seems simple at first, but it's got some unexpected depth to it. I found myself growing unexpectedly invested in the story of the Kid and his comrades. The narrator is awesome, and his voice gives the game such a unique flavor. There’s also quite a surprising amount of lore and little anecdotes that help to create the world and its backstory. By the end of the game, this feels like a truly fleshed-out and real universe with an actual history. I would love to play a full-fledged RPG set in this world, so that I could explore these environments and interact with these characters in a more thorough and in-depth way.+ As many others here have said, the music really is amazing. It’s got this electronic Western/folk vibe that is extremely evocative and works well with the visuals to produce a very cool effect…a bit lonely, a bit bittersweet, a bit exciting. The music is a huge part of why this game succeeds. The vocal songs are especially great and even beautiful. I definitely think that the original soundtrack is worth buying, some of these tracks will really stick with you for a long time.+ You've got tons of weapon variety here. I was really surprised by the number of options. You start out with a hammer and shield, but you’ll eventually get a machete, pistols, a flamethrower, a mortar cannon, a spear, trip mines, and several other weapons. You’ve also got a wide number of available super moves, some are which can be unlocked through completing special challenges with each weapon. I really loved having the ability to switch up my weapon loadout to try out different combinations; the weapons are so different that each loadout almost makes you feel like you’re playing a completely new game. If you go through most of the game using the hammer and bow, you’re going to have a very different experience from someone who swears by the calamity cannon and musket.= The combat is largely satisfying, but the ultimate effect is kind of a mixed bag.  There are some amazing, nail-biting moments of action, and there are some frustrating bits where your attacks clip through enemies or you just slog through a bunch of monsters without anything interesting happening. Some of the enemies are great, some are boring. There are some stunning highs that will make you sit up and play for another hour, and there are some lows that will make you shrug and stop playing. It can be thrilling at times and repetitive at others. The combat and mechanics ultimately average out to being simply good but not spectacular.I know that this sounds like a pretty big knock against the game - you might be saying to yourself, ""Wait, so the combat is just decent and not extraordinary? Why should I bother with this game?"" Despite what I'm telling you about the combat, and despite the flaws that I'll talk about in the next few points, I really believe that the overall experience of the game is very worthwhile. If you're willing to accept that this game will give you incredible atmosphere and mood alongside gameplay that is solid but occassionally flawed, I don't think that you'll be disappointed.- The platformating aspects aren’t very good…the ledges and walkways are extremely narrow and it can be way too easy to fall off the edge of a platform by mistake. This is by design and it's an obstacle that you're expected to overcome, but it’s annoying instead of dynamic or challenging. - The game is definitely rather short, and levels are all way too linear. You won’t be doing any real exploration or digging for lots of hidden treasures or alternate paths. There are a few collectible items that you can pick up, but they're not even remotely tucked away...they're all just laid out there right in front of you so that you can get them at your ease. I would have liked at least three or four additional missions, some light exploration elements, and a handful of boss battles. Really, why aren’t there any boss battles here? I think that a few bosses would have helped with the pacing and would have just given the missions a bit more focus and pay-off.- The ranged weapons have an auto-aim function that you can manually adjust, which sounds straight-forward enough, but the whole experience of aiming and adjusting was kind of clunky. Some weapons are better about this than others; the bow is pretty smooth, but others, like the mortar cannon or throwing weapons, are pretty stiff.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Excellent game.  Graphics: Absolutely gorgeous artwork.  You could clip some of these scenes out of the game and frame them.  Everything looks hand painted and the colors are amazing.  Everything in the game looks like it belongs there and nothing is out of place.Story: Good story with excellent narration.  Not too many choices though until the end.  There were certain points where I was having trouble following it especially when I was trying to both play and listen to the narrator at the same time.  I felt like I missed some details.  I wouldn't say the story blew my mind or anything, but it was very good and certainly interesting enough to keep you engaged for the full length of the game.  The game isn't super long, which I tend to like.  I don't like dragging things on for 20+ hours.  I got through this one in about 10 and I typically take my time through it, doing different challenges and stuff like that.Gameplay: Loved the way the map floated into place as you walked down paths.  You always knew where you had been and where you could go.  It gave me incentive to explore entire rooms to see if any additional pathways were revealed. Combat was good and responsive, but the variety was more in how unique each weapon was more than how deep the combat system was. Each weapon was fun to use and they are all very different from each other.  Made it fun to mix and match to find the best fit for either your style or that particular level in the game.  But there wasn't much in the way combinations or different ways to use the same weapon.  You kind of just get into a rythm with what you are using and do that every time.  You also get to carry two weapons at once so you can kind of pair them up to match your style.  I switched weapons a lot so I can't say I ever got tired of the combat.  Soundtrack: Loved it and am considering buying it.I almost didn't complete this game because I was using a keyboard at first.  I found it very uncomfortable and fatigued my hands. Then I got a controller and went back to this and it was night and day.  While you can play it with your keyboard, I can't recommend playing this with a controller enough.If you like a good story and enjoy the top down view, hack and slash type games you owe it to yourself to check out this one.  The weapons are fun and interesting.  The music is great and the art is pleasure to play through.  Its been out a while and I'm late to the party, but I can see why the reviews are so positive.

												Please...give me...more thumbs up buttons to click, for Bastion!!!This little game swept me off my feet and reeled me in at the first few seconds of starting it...First of all - Logan Cunningham is probably the best choice -ever- to be a narrator! His calm, deep and yet somehow so soft and pleasant voice follows the player throughout the whole game, and it could not have been a better 'companion'. The little parts of story that he tells you (well, or is telling Zia, in game, whilst The Kid goes and does the hard work) are a great little adition to your adventures. A more serious look at the past of that world, a bit of a comical insert (especially if you roll off an edge. *cough* Totally not me. *cough*), a touching, warmhearting little story...all of it is like a puzzle of vocal little pieces, that you have to put together to understand what has happened in the world of Bastion. And quite honestly - it's a brilliant way of making the player 'dive into the Bastion's Universe' and enjoy the game, his own actions during the game, whilst getting told facts or stories about the world (or the particular creatures that he's fighting currently. Second - the gameplay and looks. Amazing! As in...I could not have wished for better, from a little indie (and at the current moment - already OLD indie) game! It's rather beautiful and eerie, fluently swapping between various enviroments even on the same level. Yes, of course, the actions, combat itself will be simple and noone should expect some ultra-super-duper-gazillion-slashes-in-air-in-a-wave-like-motion-before-smacking-a-mob. But I still found it extremely enjoyable. Mostly due to the fact that you actually get such a weapon and playstyle variety, that even some of the new games pale in comparison! The mix and match of the combat possibilities is amazing. Third - the soundtrack! It's brilliant! Going from a heart-pumping rythm that makes you want to score the best...to an almost tear-jerker, as you listen to some more emotional parts of the story, told by the excellent narrator....If I knew it was so amazing, I would have bought it for the full price as well! An excellent little game that kept me entertained with every second I spent on it. And oh you bet - I will be going back into it, to get those achievements and explore the rest of the weapon combinations... :D			",34,5,0,7,5,0,2

												Years after its initial release, Bastion still stands strong as a fresh, entertaining approach to storytelling. Good games usually show off dazzling graphics, super fun gameplay, or memorable quests; truly great games sometimes even contain strong characters or engaging plots. Rarely does a video game story transcend its medium, however, and also carry emotional weight. Bastion is lush and beautiful, but it's also heart-breaking and soul-searching. This is the sort of prophetic adventure that everyone should experience. Strongly recommended.			",50,12,0,2,0,0,1

You will enjoy this beautiful story told by the narrator, while you play in a similar Hack and Slash mode. The game offer a lot of modes and extras to complete the game several times and more even if you want the achievements.I have to recognise that the dreams with the 10 idols are sometimes frustrating because they are hard, but even then you will be enjoying a good game with an epic soundtrack.Buy it, you will not regret it.

												Bastion is a fantastic game. The game atmosphere is very good, instilling the somewhat serious and sad nature of the story. The narrator narrates based on your actions, whether you're rushing through a map, or standing still often. The gameplay isn't the best, but it works fine for what it is, and is still quite enjoyable. This game really got me right in the feels, it is very well done. The only downside is the length of the game. I finished it in only a few hours. That being said, i feel the story and general quality of the game makes up for the length, and i highly recommend it.

												And again I have feels and tears and everything, because this thing is beautiful. I love the story, the graphics, the music (which brings such an atmosphere every time, especially, the vocal songs, which are placed perfectly. They create kind of a cinematic effect and bring this feeling of wistfullness and longing and homesickness, which is beautiful), and the character are amazing. Every character has their own story, which are always about overcoming all the obstacles and trying to find their place in life no matter what. And it’s just so detailed and beautifully done (I love how after you finished the game for the first time you have a “New Game Plus” option in which the narrator is always having a deja vu, which shows us how the story repeats itself and no matter how many times we rewinded the time and prevented “the Calamity”, it happens anyway)It’s definitely one of my favourite games of all times.

												He decides to write a review, nah I'm just kidding.Proper story supposed to start at the beginning, its not so simple with this one.The Bastion, the last stronghold after the Calamity (a world destroying event that wrecks everything and kills almost everyone) you have to get there, restore it to its former glory and from there set on off to save the world.Bastion is a crazy awesome game, the entire game is told by the perspective of a narrator and his amazing voice. You play as ""The Kid"" a nameless badass who is one of the only survivors. You'll travel to exotic locations and fight a huge variety of amazing enemies. Did I mention the fact the combat in this game is amazing? A series of rolls and dodges followed by the swing of your hammer, slash of your sword, or that slow charge up for the critical hit on the bow that is the most satisfying feeling when you get it just right. Bastions combat is boosted by two major contributions:1. Bastion gives you a series of passive powerups as you progress in level. You'll find abilities in here from doing more damage to gaining health on blocking. And everytime you level up it lets you have one more of these amazing passives that can totally change the way the game works.2. Bastion gives you plenty of weapons to clear the wilds in search of cores and shards to restore the bastion. From your trusty hammer to the powerful explosive mortar, to dual pistols and a trusty carbine, to a razer sharp sword and a pike. Oh? Did I mention you get to mix and match these any way you want to? Did I also mention that every weapon has 5 upgrades slots that can range from adding damage over time, halving reload time, to adding critical chance and blast radius. You want one of video gamings best soundtracks, sure, Bastion has that too. You want a challenge? Try turning all 10 idols on (little idol statues that add difficulty to the game through means such as making enemies regenerate health or attack faster or deal double damage or even reflect your own bullets back at you, or explode on death).So we have:Amazing SoundtrackGreat CharactersSuper Awesome GameplayOne of the Best Stories EverFinal Note: Just get this. Just buy it. Its worth it.			",310,54,5,32,26,3,47

												While there's little new or genuinely innovative here, that isn't to take anything away from the beautifully painted environments, solid story, excellent soundtrack and well executed game mechanism.Probably the defining characteristic is the wonderfully voiced storyteller - he's honeydipped gravel, and happy to break the fourth wall for the benefit of advancing the storyline - akin to Sam Elliott's Stranger from The Big Lebowski, and equally enjoyable.At the ridiculously discounted prices it seems to be available for on a regular basis, it would almost be a crime not to own and play it through at least once.

												Bastion is an action RPG with some serious customisation and a great story-telling mechanic. You'll be given the opportunity to play as ""the kid"" in this compelling tale of post-calamity ruin.This game needs praising for a couple of things that it did really well:* It kept things simple: You have two weapons, the ability to block and roll, and a special attack* It use a small number of characters, but detailed them well* It was the perfect length to not get bored with, I was happy to play it again after completion.If you have the chance to pick up Bastion, I would recommed it. It is well polished (even weapons I thought were terrible upgraded to some of my favorites), has an excellent narrator, and is entertaining to play.			",41,24,0,11,4,0,10

												Bastion is, without a doubt, one of the best narrative, atmospheric, story rich indie games I have ever played. However, let’s cut right to the chase; should you pay £11 (or equiv) for this game?The straight answer is no. Why? Well, because although this game has many great aspects, for a game this short with such little depth, you pay something along the lines of £2 per hour of enjoyment. The game can be completed in less than 5 hours, and once you understand the mechanics, a second play through is completely unnecessary and adds nothing to the experience at all. Unfortunately, because this game received so much attention, its price is naturally higher to make up for the marketing budget. This is unfortunate, because if its price point was the price of an average indie game, somewhere along the lines of £6 to £8, I would have absolutely recommended it without a second thought.But, if you are wondering about whether to purchase this regardless of its price point, read on, and find out why I'd recommend this game.Firstly, Bastion's narration is some of the best I've ever heard, full stop. Not just from indie games, from AAA games too. The game is narrated in second person view; meaning as you explore and roam around the world, the narration will describe your movements and actions and directly refer to you as the character. The narrator’s voice is deep and brooding and when I first started playing it was somewhat disconcerting, largely due to the fact that the voice is slightly unnerving, and creates an atmosphere of uneasiness. However, it fits in perfectly with the themes of the game. I also love the way in which the story is presented through pretty much only the use of the narrative. At one point, you spot a man who is still alive amongst a mass of dead people, frozen into stone. The narrator however knows more than the boy you play as, and says “Just think, if we didn’t have people like him, we wouldn’t be in this mess, would we.” The character you play knows nothing about who this man is or why he’s any different from anyone else, but the narrator does. If I hadn’t replayed this part of the game, I wouldn’t have remembered that such an event occurs. It adds a refreshing layer into a game which otherwise may have held very little replayabiliy.Another point is that this game does a magnificent job of engrossing you into the world. The soundtrack is fantastic, and, without a doubt, the greatest redeeming aspect of Bastion is its absolutely beautiful art style. It oozes with passion and you get the general sense that someone loved every second they drew the stunning watercolour masterpieces you see throughout the whole game. You control a character only known as 'The Kid', of which very little is known, or is ever known, apart from that he served in the military. Along the way, you gather increasing attachment to this silent hero who receives no thanks despite never stopping and never giving up. The world is reliant on him, and he pushes forward, absolutely emotionlessly, and this dark, brooding nature raises real questions about such a mysterious character. Honestly, I think the fact that we only learn tiny snippets about the character is one of the best things the developers did to this game. More often than not, character progression can go too far or not far enough, but in this case, it’s pretty much perfect for the type of game it is. I felt the slightest twinge of empathy when I learnt of The Kid’s situation, but not enough for me to feel like I was forced into feelings of depression or sadness, and was rather presented with facts and allowed to feel as I naturally would. There are a few downsides, none of which I’d really say demean Bastion’s brilliance to an extent that I’d consider it not worth playing, but I will mention them briefly regardless. A massive lack of replayability plagues this game. There is really no reason to want to replay this game. There aren’t any difficult choices which lead you upon a different path, there aren’t any new weapons or characters to find. It’s largely based on an immersive first playthrough. This leads to the question of value for money, as to which it isn’t great.I found slight trouble with keyboard controls, and I’d greatly recommend a controller, as it makes exploring much smoother and enjoyable. Once I started to use a controller, I felt like I understood some of the mechanics much better.It also suffers from a general lack of any sort of character progress in terms of stats. It’s not an RPG; in reality it’s more of a story-telling experience in which you play the protagonist. You have weapon upgrades, but even they fall somewhat through, since they’re largely passive and can be overlooked almost entirely.When it comes down to it, I would recommend this game. Why? Perhaps not for its merit as a video game, since the mechanics are somewhat forgettable and simple, but instead because of its merit as a work of art. After you play this game, if ever someone proclaims the infamous ‘video games cannot be art’ statement, you will be infuriated, thrust Bastion in their face and declare them a ♥♥♥♥ing idiotic moron.

												Bastion is properly one of the most original game experiences I have ever tryed in mt life.This game is a overwiev shotter, and it is very well crafted. The idea gameplay wise is, that you travel from land to land, and try to recover something from each land. Along the way you will find diffrent weapons, upgrades and powerups to help you on your quest.The weapons is one of my favorite aspects of the game, simply becouse non of the weapons felt alike, at least to me. You could chosse a fast gun with low damage, a charging gun with high damage, a quick sord you could throw, a hammer with a lot of damage and so on. Why I loved this aspect so much, is becouse it changed the way you played, and you could try diffrent things and upgrades out, in order to find the combination of weapons, that suited you the best. Let`s talk about the main world, so the idea is that you are trying to rebuild a thing called the Bastion, and when you rebuild a part of it, new things will be unlocked. I will talk more about the Bastion later when it comed to the story. The places you unlock is for eksample the weapon store I already talked about. Then there is a posion store, where you can give youself boosts. Then there is a challenge board, that will show you diffrent things you can do, in order to achive more curency. Thn there is the ideal store, where you can activate god ideals, in order to get a harder challengee, but get mroe XP and money. The overall gameplay is fluid and actionpackt, and when you fail or get hit, I never blamied the controles, I blamied myself. I knew I made a mistake, and I made sure,I did not do the same thing again. I simply loved the overall gamepaly aspekt becouse of this.Now I want to combine the story, the worlds, the challenges, the bosses and the music into one part simply becouse they work so fluid together. The story is told through a naorator, who is called the old man. You play as the kid, and every thing happening, is told through the old man. This means the game is like one big storytelling, and it really sets the tone, and makes humores things happening, becouse of the way the old man is. Every single world and challenge fells uniqe becouse of the old man , he tells lore to the palces and the overall landscape and worldbehavior is diffrent nearly every single time. The music to every single stage is beutifully crafted, and I highly recormend getting the soundtrack somewhere becouse it is beutyful. So the world you live in, has been blown up, by a bomb, and the old man, tells you, he maybe can fix it with the Bastion. Therfore you must rebuild parts of the Bastion one by one, and afterwards power the Bastion up. Along the way you incounder more survivers of the bomb, and that esculates into more story development. One of the survivers wants to attack you, becouse he finds out something about the bomb, but I will not spoil it. The bosses in this game are all amazing, and they all prove to be a great challenge to you. The ending of the game is amazing, and it really made me fell full of emeotion for the charecters in the game. The last choice you have to make was so hard for me, that I at least stood there for 5 minuts and thought it through, becouse of the big change it would to to the charecters I had experienced this great adventure with.Overall this game is amazing, it delevered such an impact on me, becouse of the overall presentation, and the amzing experience it delevred to me. I highly recormend this game, thumps up. 9 out of 10			",477,148,8,55,46,9,70

 Near perfect. Almost has everything a game needs. Let's start with what is possibly one of the best example of voice acting in video game to this date. The narrator, who gives a commentary on your adventure in past tense even though you are playing through this story in the future, is amazing. His voice is godly, emotionless at time but look (or listen) closer and you'll start to learn much more about him. He does a perfect job. Not to mention the wonderful combat system where with all the combinations of weapons and challenge modes will keep you interested and sweating if you want but if you don't, it's really fluent and frustration-free to just experience the story. Beautiful design with both the storytelling and arts fascinating. With no strings attached you get to have your choice and be deeply moved/reflect a lot. At least I personally had gained unimagined insights and edifications from it unaccessible elsewhere, seriously. (Don't want to be too specific lest it becomes a spoiler)I really enjoyed Bastion because it had a gripping story to tell me. I felt like I was playing a book. Emotionally invested is the right word choice. In all, games that touch our hearts are so rare these days, yet Bastion does it wonderfully, and genuinely, unlike some games which claim to do so but really don't; what's more is it also achieves amazing playability along with the story. Buy it, you won't regret it because it's that good.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really can't recommend enough that you play this game. I just finished it and it is one of the best I've ever played. It is an action RPG, though with emphasis on the action with and incredibly engaging story and amazing music.The real strength of this game is story and story telling. There is a Narrator who is telling this story and he has a lot to say. Most reviews I've seen say he narrates ""everything you do"". This is not correct, and thankfully so, because that would get dull. No, the strength of the Narrator is that he MIGHT comment on ANYTHING you do. You never know when you'll get a comment. It might be because you just beat up a big group of enemies without getting hit, or because you fell off the ledge a lot. He is also constantly giving you insight into the city before ""The Calamity"", a catastrophic even that happened right before the game starts. I found myself not really caring what the Calamity was, but wanting to know everything about the city before. He tells you how many of the monsters you fight aren't monsters, but creatures that actually had important roles in society before the Calamity changed them and the world. There is even one scene that tries to make you feel bad for them, though once I recognized that, I felt it somewhat contrived.The plot is also good, with information being given to you slowly, so you keep pushing forward so the Narrator will tell you more about what happened or what is going on. There are actually two choices at the end, which surprised me. The last choice had me thinking like no game ever has. I couldn't decide for awhile! I'm going to play New Game + to see the other side of both. There is also a scene where you base is attacked, and the game made me angry with just a few small words ""Our little [pet]... didn't make it"". It's something special to draw out emotion like that.The action is fun. The combat comes in spurts, with some running around and listening (more on that later) so you have a breather and don't really feel overwhelmed. On the one hand, this makes the game easy, but it also keeps it from being boring.  Don't look for really stong RPG elements, as leveling is slow and only allows you to carry one more ""tonic"" which give benefits. You gain the tonics themselves independently. Some are found and some are bought. But there are a lot of weapons and each has 5 upgrage tiers, with 2 options for each tier and you can switch them whenever you want. There is a 2 weapon system, so you will probably find a favorite combo.Finally, the music is also awesome. In most games, you might be too busy with the action to focus much on music, but the way this game plays, especially with the pauses between fights, you can really pay attention to the music. It is a fantastic soundtrack and fits the setting, which I'd describe a mix between fantasy and western, as odd as that might sound. A few tracks include excellent vocals.This is a fantastic game, well worth your $15, and I'm the guy that waits for everything to go on sale. Buy it, buy it now!			",111,43,0,29,5,0,12

												Let me tell you a story about Bastion.On one of my old computers, there was this little program which let you play demos of random games such as Diner Dash etc. Bastion was among them and the narrator immediately captured my interest. I can't imagine I was that great at the game (having never really played a game) but I remember really really wanting to buy it and finish it.Fast forward a few years, I see it on Steam and although half of me is estastic, the other half is a little wary. It was an old game and I was hesitant to whether my memory was tainted by rose-tinted glasses. Fortunately I was not disappointed. Although the game is a few years old, the graphics are absolutely gorgeous and, the best part, the narrator's voice was exactly how I imagined it. Humous, witty, and a touch of nostalgia, I feel like the narrator really tied the game together.Now, about the game. There is a touch of replayability in this if you want to see all sides of the story as well as complete all the challenges perfectly. However, the game is a largely somewhat linear style action game with loveable characters and an intriguing story.Highly recommend it. One of my favourite games on my list.			",60,22,1,12,4,0,4

												Bastion is, without a doubt in my mind, one of the best video games to come out of a low budget development teams ever. It is a game that can be considered a masterpiece, but let me delve into the why. For one on a presentation level the game looks amazing, handdrawn and extremely artistic backdrops help liven up the hack and slash fun within Bastion. The voice acting is done by amazing actor Logan Cunningham. Logan narrates almost every move and decision you make throughout the game. For example near the begining of the game if you fall off any of the map edges you will be presented with a well delevered witty comment saying ""And then the kid fell to his death [Short Pause]. I'm just kidding"" This goes through the whole game and all story is explaned through the narrators comments about the fall of the world (Also known as 'The Calamity') and also the backstory of the kid and all his fellows within the Bastion. And while there are many elements as to the background of the world and the characters within it there are many hints to events which make cause for tons of speculation. On top of all this Bastion has increadibly fun hack and slash gameplay. Bastion has you using various diffrent weapons at your disposle to get the job done. The game isnt too challangeing but lucky the game even has a feature where you can anger the gods making the game much harder. Finally it wouldn't be a Bastion review without stating how genius the soundtrack is. Every track evokes tons of emotions that either fill the heart with saddness or fill your spirit with power fantasy. If this review wasnt enough to convince you go watch a trailer and just see how increadible the art, voice acting, story and sound track are in this masterpiece of a game.-AUS ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)			",97,26,1,8,6,1,14

Kid didn't get along well with the narrator, got annoyed of him and grew tired of all the repetitive wham and bam he was doing.This kid got bored and frustrated, couldn't seem empathize with the other kid nor could he immerse himself in the story. The poor kid seems to have lost sight of things and let himself become corrupted by the Calamity. Gone. Just like that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just Stunning,One of the first games I owned on steam, I bought it on accident XD.Well I'm glad it miracousily happened like that because this game is a..FRICKEN WORK OF ART! Seriously I rarely see this game get talked about, which is sad because this game is very vibrant when it comes to content! It's music is OUTSTANDING, it's story is SOOOO enveloping and engaging, the narrator's voice is  compairable to morgan freeman's, and the combat is SO GOOD! Not to mention the weapons you can unlock, i personal like the dual revolvers and the hammer considering it's like, BOOM TWO HAND GUNS, then you're like, BUT WAIT HAMMER TIME! It's very in depth about itself and is a great first game that deserves a DIRECT SEQUAL! Yes i know about the other game, I haven't picked it up yet. Any way, This game is great and you should totally invest in it, it throws a lot of curve balls at you aswell with the difficulty and other things! Pick it up DARN IT!!!			",56,7,0,5,5,2,1

												And again I have feels and tears and everything, because this thing is beautiful. I love the story, the graphics, the music (which brings such an atmosphere every time, especially, the vocal songs, which are placed perfectly. They create kind of a cinematic effect and bring this feeling of wistfullness and longing and homesickness, which is beautiful), and the character are amazing. Every character has their own story, which are always about overcoming all the obstacles and trying to find their place in life no matter what. And it’s just so detailed and beautifully done (I love how after you finished the game for the first time you have a “New Game Plus” option in which the narrator is always having a deja vu, which shows us how the story repeats itself and no matter how many times we rewinded the time and prevented “the Calamity”, it happens anyway)It’s definitely one of my favourite games of all times.

												Bastion is one of my favourite games ever. First of all, everything about it is stunning. The voice acting, music, artwork, and design are all top notch; I immediately downloaded the soundtrack in the middle of my first playthrough. It's a pretty short game - it usually takes me about 8-10 hours to finish if I mess around in it, but I replay it over and over. There are different modes to unlock after you finish the first story mode that allow for different ways to enjoy it, although as far as I can tell only one new thing appears, besides some amusing (if subtle) commentary changes. -The play style is basically point-shoot and it's sort of like a 3D platformer, but I haven't played any games like it before, so it gets a +1 for being original. -The story isn't the most original but it is compelling and fun to listen to (it's narrated by one of the characters), and I always get a bit choked up at the end. -There are a ton of weapon possibilities, since there are maybe 15 different weapons to choose from and you can have two at a time, plus a 'special' skill of which there are a lot more (25 maybe? Not sure).-It's also not particularly difficult, but there are up to 10 'idols' available that can make it basically impossible (yay, 'chivos!).-The story is mainly linear, with some 'detour' areas until the very last little bit, where you have to make two decisions. Neither of them are ""good vs evil!"", which I like a lot because both times the decisions are hard to make and during my first playthrough I knew I'd be playing it over again so that I could choose the other. Each time it's heartwrenching, despite the fact that I've tried all four combinations. Even though the story stays the same (besides the outcome), I enjoy the replays, as I've already mentioned. Overall, probably 8/10 from me, but only because it's so short and there aren't enough tracks.			",24,7,0,6,5,0,2

												He decides to write a review, nah I'm just kidding.Proper story supposed to start at the beginning, its not so simple with this one.The Bastion, the last stronghold after the Calamity (a world destroying event that wrecks everything and kills almost everyone) you have to get there, restore it to its former glory and from there set on off to save the world.Bastion is a crazy awesome game, the entire game is told by the perspective of a narrator and his amazing voice. You play as ""The Kid"" a nameless badass who is one of the only survivors. You'll travel to exotic locations and fight a huge variety of amazing enemies. Did I mention the fact the combat in this game is amazing? A series of rolls and dodges followed by the swing of your hammer, slash of your sword, or that slow charge up for the critical hit on the bow that is the most satisfying feeling when you get it just right. Bastions combat is boosted by two major contributions:1. Bastion gives you a series of passive powerups as you progress in level. You'll find abilities in here from doing more damage to gaining health on blocking. And everytime you level up it lets you have one more of these amazing passives that can totally change the way the game works.2. Bastion gives you plenty of weapons to clear the wilds in search of cores and shards to restore the bastion. From your trusty hammer to the powerful explosive mortar, to dual pistols and a trusty carbine, to a razer sharp sword and a pike. Oh? Did I mention you get to mix and match these any way you want to? Did I also mention that every weapon has 5 upgrades slots that can range from adding damage over time, halving reload time, to adding critical chance and blast radius. You want one of video gamings best soundtracks, sure, Bastion has that too. You want a challenge? Try turning all 10 idols on (little idol statues that add difficulty to the game through means such as making enemies regenerate health or attack faster or deal double damage or even reflect your own bullets back at you, or explode on death).So we have:Amazing SoundtrackGreat CharactersSuper Awesome GameplayOne of the Best Stories EverFinal Note: Just get this. Just buy it. Its worth it.			",310,54,5,32,26,3,47

Posted: July 21, 2014
												I had a lot of fun playing through this game so I figured I would do a quick review:Story:The story for Bastion was incredibly unique. For a game that is the price of a meal at a fast food reasturant (at least at the time I purchased it), Bastion delivers a well thought out tale that strings the levels together, without burdening you to pay attention to every detail in the game in order to understand it. The intrigue of the storyline is largely due to the brilliance of the added narrarator. The narrator truly kept the game intersting and enjoyable. Somehow, even dying early on in the game wasnt a drag due to the narrarator spewing out one of his quick blurbs right after you die such as ""Just kidding, that's not what happened"". The story isn't going to wow you like the Bioshock series, but it still has a fair share of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat.Graphics:There seems to be a trend in indie games having unique graphics as part of the appeal. Either as retro 8 bit or more stylized. Bastion is no exeption. It has a very distinctive look with its fluorescent colours and lush hand painted environments. Bastion breaks away from the tedium of other platform games of its type. The reason I say that it breaks away is because of Bastion's unique style of varying environments. Unlike even some AAA games, Bastion is constantly changing the levels colour spectrum, enemies, and overall feel. From floating urban settings, to swamps and jungles, and finally to snow filled caverns. All the while, your presented to well made landscapes that are visually impressive due to their distinctiveness. As a side note, this game is not graphically intensive and runs on my basic Dell labtop perfectly.Gameplay:Bastion boasts a customizable expereince that categorizes it as an RPG. There is a wealth of close and far weapons that are really dependent on the player. Personally, I never really had a bread and butter loadout, but even if you look online, every setup is viable. Very few people have the same setup, as by the end of the game you are given so many options that your loadout is tailored to your personal play style and strategy. The charecter you play as, simply known as ""The Kid"", is very responsive and quick on his feet. The controls and movement are solid and tight. never will you worry about the gamer's dreaded ""Button Lag"". Bastion offers a solid layer of strategy due to your loadout  which includes your two weapons, a secret skill, and your selection of spirits. The weapons are all customizable allowing you to vary up even further how you want to play. A simple machete can be used as a fast, posion inducing blade, maybe a critical hit machine for taking down bigger foes, or even used as a sort of javelin. The options really alter the gameplay. Along with your weapons is your secret skill. The skills are extremely varied. Some are based on which weapon you have equiped, while others such as a hand grenade, or a skill that makes enemies fight for you, are independent from your weapons. Finally, is your spirits which you gain more slots for by leveling up. In other words, higher level=more passive bonuses. These drinks truely alter gameplay. Some boost basic things like health or your critical hit chance, while others can help you survive a blow that would have killed you.Sound:Unforunately, I am not a huge sound guy. I don't play games with headphones and therefore might miss the immersion that a shooter might bring with it's explosvie array of sounds. As for Bastion though, I was actually quite suprised with its sounds. Combat sounds were rich the feeling of a gun actually packing a punch. Blades had a slicing sound that made them seem as though they actually cut something instead of just air wooshing by. And the best part of Bastion's sounds, is its soundtrack. Very few times do i play games and find myself humming a tune from it hours later. Not the case with Bastion. The soundtrack is spectacular and suprised me with how catchy and infectious it was.Replayability/ length:In the case of Bastion, there is reason to go back and replay the story. After completing the game for the first time,  I was only around level 5 or so. There are 10 levels total that I know of, and with levels comes more spirits and more gameplay options. Plus, there is so much customization that can be had, that one playthrough means you neglected at least a weapon or two. Unfortunately for Bastion though, the replayability and it's length are the one true flaw for me. No spoilers, but towards the end of the game you make a few choices that seem like they would have a big impact. To great dismay, you never see the impact, there is hardly an epilogue showcasing what occured due to your final choice and so, that segment of the game seems almost unneccasary. This means that going back through the game to make a different choice is almost pointless. While I am already bashing Bastion, I have to bring up how it is very short. You can easily complete the game in a solid day or two. Combine that with a lack of story differential between playthroughs and this game could be a play, beat, and  collect dust depending on the person. In my humble opinion, I have yet to get bored, but I must mention, for the person wishing to spend hundreds of hours on a game, this probably isn't for you.In conclusion, Bastion offers a great amount of enjoyment for a small fee. Although a tad short, it will keep you entertained the ride through with its amazing soundtrack, broad amount of  customization options, and a distinct art style that warrant this little gem an 9/10 from me.

												Bastion is an action RPG with some serious customisation and a great story-telling mechanic. You'll be given the opportunity to play as ""the kid"" in this compelling tale of post-calamity ruin.This game needs praising for a couple of things that it did really well:* It kept things simple: You have two weapons, the ability to block and roll, and a special attack* It use a small number of characters, but detailed them well* It was the perfect length to not get bored with, I was happy to play it again after completion.If you have the chance to pick up Bastion, I would recommed it. It is well polished (even weapons I thought were terrible upgraded to some of my favorites), has an excellent narrator, and is entertaining to play.			",41,24,0,11,4,0,10

 Near perfect. Almost has everything a game needs. Let's start with what is possibly one of the best example of voice acting in video game to this date. The narrator, who gives a commentary on your adventure in past tense even though you are playing through this story in the future, is amazing. His voice is godly, emotionless at time but look (or listen) closer and you'll start to learn much more about him. He does a perfect job. Not to mention the wonderful combat system where with all the combinations of weapons and challenge modes will keep you interested and sweating if you want but if you don't, it's really fluent and frustration-free to just experience the story. Beautiful design with both the storytelling and arts fascinating. With no strings attached you get to have your choice and be deeply moved/reflect a lot. At least I personally had gained unimagined insights and edifications from it unaccessible elsewhere, seriously. (Don't want to be too specific lest it becomes a spoiler)I really enjoyed Bastion because it had a gripping story to tell me. I felt like I was playing a book. Emotionally invested is the right word choice. In all, games that touch our hearts are so rare these days, yet Bastion does it wonderfully, and genuinely, unlike some games which claim to do so but really don't; what's more is it also achieves amazing playability along with the story. Buy it, you won't regret it because it's that good.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Stunning graphics, tight gameplay, and quite a story to boot. The player is immediatly immersed in this world from the moment you start, I highly recommend this game to people who both enjoy a good story or like to run around and beat things with a hammer.			",60,0,0,1,3,0,1

												Let me tell you a story about Bastion.On one of my old computers, there was this little program which let you play demos of random games such as Diner Dash etc. Bastion was among them and the narrator immediately captured my interest. I can't imagine I was that great at the game (having never really played a game) but I remember really really wanting to buy it and finish it.Fast forward a few years, I see it on Steam and although half of me is estastic, the other half is a little wary. It was an old game and I was hesitant to whether my memory was tainted by rose-tinted glasses. Fortunately I was not disappointed. Although the game is a few years old, the graphics are absolutely gorgeous and, the best part, the narrator's voice was exactly how I imagined it. Humous, witty, and a touch of nostalgia, I feel like the narrator really tied the game together.Now, about the game. There is a touch of replayability in this if you want to see all sides of the story as well as complete all the challenges perfectly. However, the game is a largely somewhat linear style action game with loveable characters and an intriguing story.Highly recommend it. One of my favourite games on my list.			",60,22,1,12,4,0,4

												Just Stunning,One of the first games I owned on steam, I bought it on accident XD.Well I'm glad it miracousily happened like that because this game is a..FRICKEN WORK OF ART! Seriously I rarely see this game get talked about, which is sad because this game is very vibrant when it comes to content! It's music is OUTSTANDING, it's story is SOOOO enveloping and engaging, the narrator's voice is  compairable to morgan freeman's, and the combat is SO GOOD! Not to mention the weapons you can unlock, i personal like the dual revolvers and the hammer considering it's like, BOOM TWO HAND GUNS, then you're like, BUT WAIT HAMMER TIME! It's very in depth about itself and is a great first game that deserves a DIRECT SEQUAL! Yes i know about the other game, I haven't picked it up yet. Any way, This game is great and you should totally invest in it, it throws a lot of curve balls at you aswell with the difficulty and other things! Pick it up DARN IT!!!			",56,7,0,5,5,2,1

												Bastion is properly one of the most original game experiences I have ever tryed in mt life.This game is a overwiev shotter, and it is very well crafted. The idea gameplay wise is, that you travel from land to land, and try to recover something from each land. Along the way you will find diffrent weapons, upgrades and powerups to help you on your quest.The weapons is one of my favorite aspects of the game, simply becouse non of the weapons felt alike, at least to me. You could chosse a fast gun with low damage, a charging gun with high damage, a quick sord you could throw, a hammer with a lot of damage and so on. Why I loved this aspect so much, is becouse it changed the way you played, and you could try diffrent things and upgrades out, in order to find the combination of weapons, that suited you the best. Let`s talk about the main world, so the idea is that you are trying to rebuild a thing called the Bastion, and when you rebuild a part of it, new things will be unlocked. I will talk more about the Bastion later when it comed to the story. The places you unlock is for eksample the weapon store I already talked about. Then there is a posion store, where you can give youself boosts. Then there is a challenge board, that will show you diffrent things you can do, in order to achive more curency. Thn there is the ideal store, where you can activate god ideals, in order to get a harder challengee, but get mroe XP and money. The overall gameplay is fluid and actionpackt, and when you fail or get hit, I never blamied the controles, I blamied myself. I knew I made a mistake, and I made sure,I did not do the same thing again. I simply loved the overall gamepaly aspekt becouse of this.Now I want to combine the story, the worlds, the challenges, the bosses and the music into one part simply becouse they work so fluid together. The story is told through a naorator, who is called the old man. You play as the kid, and every thing happening, is told through the old man. This means the game is like one big storytelling, and it really sets the tone, and makes humores things happening, becouse of the way the old man is. Every single world and challenge fells uniqe becouse of the old man , he tells lore to the palces and the overall landscape and worldbehavior is diffrent nearly every single time. The music to every single stage is beutifully crafted, and I highly recormend getting the soundtrack somewhere becouse it is beutyful. So the world you live in, has been blown up, by a bomb, and the old man, tells you, he maybe can fix it with the Bastion. Therfore you must rebuild parts of the Bastion one by one, and afterwards power the Bastion up. Along the way you incounder more survivers of the bomb, and that esculates into more story development. One of the survivers wants to attack you, becouse he finds out something about the bomb, but I will not spoil it. The bosses in this game are all amazing, and they all prove to be a great challenge to you. The ending of the game is amazing, and it really made me fell full of emeotion for the charecters in the game. The last choice you have to make was so hard for me, that I at least stood there for 5 minuts and thought it through, becouse of the big change it would to to the charecters I had experienced this great adventure with.Overall this game is amazing, it delevered such an impact on me, becouse of the overall presentation, and the amzing experience it delevred to me. I highly recormend this game, thumps up. 9 out of 10			",477,148,8,55,46,9,70

												The Bastion is by far one of the best games I have ever played. I respect good stories and good sound track in a game. However, not only is that what this game included, but it took it the next step further by having insanly fun and smooth game play along with an amazing narator that brings the game together. Its not a long game but its worth every cent.			",37,2,0,1,1,0,2

												Kid finds the Bastion on Steam sale...It welcomes him with a familiar, yet fresh style. Its landscapes like an oil painting, its soundtrack envelopes the world beautifully and animations are elegantly sleek. Certainly a strong argument that games can themselves be a work of artHack n slash... kid's seen it before. But not like this. Elegant combat mechanics and a hearty arsenal that continues to grow throughout the game - each with their own distinct niche and style. Hard to comment on balance... kid seemed to believe that some were stronger than others, but friends found otherwise. Certainly reassuring to see each weapon come with its own learning curve of sorts. But kid can only pick two... that and the shield on his back. Game's not that cruel though... kid can change loadouts, and even change the upgrades themselves for free - allowing the full enjoyment of exploring different combinations to suit their style without punishing the decisions. Certainly more forgiving... than the calamity...About that... this story ain't anything new. It doesn't twist and turn, but is elegantly spun with nothing more than the guiding sound of a rustic narrator to weave the story together as the world itself continually weaves beneath the kid's feet. Every now and then the plot will be augmented with a single, simple, yet beautiful drawingBlack potions also help the kid to... swing things in his favour in a pinch. A single special ability. Balance is definitely more questionable here. Use the Calamity Cannon multi-shot ability and come tell me the other ones match it. Passive bonuses from the distillery (and my... special stash) futher enrich the level of customisability and allow the kid to really carve the game in his styleSure the kid's seen games like this before. But what it does, it does to near perfection. It burrowed into the kid's library and found a special place in its heartI guess you could say it found the Bastion			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bastion is a fantastic game. The game atmosphere is very good, instilling the somewhat serious and sad nature of the story. The narrator narrates based on your actions, whether you're rushing through a map, or standing still often. The gameplay isn't the best, but it works fine for what it is, and is still quite enjoyable. This game really got me right in the feels, it is very well done. The only downside is the length of the game. I finished it in only a few hours. That being said, i feel the story and general quality of the game makes up for the length, and i highly recommend it.
