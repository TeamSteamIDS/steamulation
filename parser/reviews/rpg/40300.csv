												The last old style hardcore rpg like Morrowind...Tha ""real"" successor of Gothic III made by their original creators.And with quite beautiful graphics in spite of its age.- Badass difficuty, learn to fight and learn to run away or get eaten by ostriches, or even worse, smashed by gnomes !- No arrow on the mini map, no map at all if you don't acquire one.- Factions and related quests... Be smart when or what to do.- Very fun & interesting dialogues made by good actors.- No auto level, find a teacher or stack your xp points (The teachers really teach you each skill with a tale or advices on each step of the skill leveling)Danger & Exploration...Immersive world and storyline...Castaway on an island of the pre-console era... The last real ""PC RPG"" in my point of view !A great adventure.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Risen is very nice RPG with a greatly immersive world where every bit of exploration is rewarded and wandering off the beaten path never feels useless and time wasted.Of course one has to admit that tech-wise the game feels dated with stiff animations and the odd feeling of deja-vu when almost every 2 NPCs you encounter looks the same - there seems to be exactly one base model for all females too XD. However, as soon as your character talks to those NPCs they feel like flashed out personalities and help create that feel of immersion that makes this game great imho.Furthermore, there is no pre-game class selection and only over time will one decide if he is to become a mage or a warrior. A sword/axe fighter can still use and depending on the skills one chooses to learn even may be able to create spell scrolls as well as a mage might be using a sword.Overall this one can be a very nice experience if one is able to look past its dated-look!

Basic InformationTitle:  RisenDeveloper:  Piranha BytesPublisher:  Deep SilverGenre:  Role Playing GameGeneral ImpressionRisen is the spiritual successor to the Gothic series and it proivdes an excellent RPG experience combined with plenty of exploration in a somewhat open fantasy world setting. Indeed Gothic players will find the combat and inventory system familiar while newer players will have to get used to it. It's not that hard and the game provides just the right amount of challenge. You have lots of quests to choose from and three classes to develop your character around. Strong Points+ Pleasant graphics.+ Great storyline within a large open-world+ Steam Trading Cards.Weak Points- No Achievements.- Finicky control scheme.Rating 9/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews and Cubbes.

												I did not know what I was getting myself into when I first started this game. Not at all actually, as I had no knowledge of what the game even was apart from being an RPG. I hadn't read any sort of reviews, seen movies, or anything of the sort.This is far less impressive than it might sound, as I had gotten the game through a bundle (humble bundle) with a bunch of other games, and if I'm being honest I only started playing for the trading cards I would get. The original plan I had was just to play for a few minutes to see what it was, and if it was anything worth spending time on. I fully expected just to tab out after a few minutes and let it run in background until I got the card drops, and then proceed to uninstall and never touch it again.What I found though, was something I could not put down. 37'ish hours later and I've completed the game in just a few short days. It was one helluva experience.The game started out quirky in that combat was not really that good, but since I was just playing for a few minutes anyway, I decided to roll with it, and slay a few monsters. I barely survived the first few encounters, and had to scour the beach where you start for supplies to munch on in order to regain some health.After 30 minutes of game time, I was hooked. Not since Gothic had I played such a game that was this punishing yet satisfying. I found I could go anywhere, but quickly learned what monsters to stay away from. In the beginning I could hardly kill the most simple monsters, and I couldn't understand why when I leveled up, nothing happened and I apparently couldn't put points in anywhere. Having played Gothic, I figured I'd stumble upon the solution before long with some sort of trainers, and as it turns out, that was exactly the case. You see, skills have a set number of levels, and you need to put a big amount of points into them to become truly good at something, be it using a bow, casting a spell, using a sword, or sneaking, pickpocketing and so on. The only problem is, there isn't enough points for everything because monsters don't respawn, so what you see is what you get (with a very few exceptions between chapters), so there's no grinding in this game, which is great, but also forces you to choose a few skills and stick with them, because being a jack of all trades in this game just isn't as good as a specialist.Fast forward 24 hours of gameplay time and I'm still in the first chapter, and had explored most of the island and killed most of the available mobs instead of going to the first town and progressing the story. It was tough, but I learned a lot about combat, and how to fight the various monsters.Speaking about combat, when you decide upon melee weapon style (staff, axe, sword), you can level it up to level 10, and with each new level you gain faster speed, or more manuerability, and learn to make consecutive swings. This allows you to string together a flurry of combos which makes short work of enemies you had previous thought were neigh impossible to deal with.I played 26 or so hours with no armor at all, as there was simply none available until a certain point in the story (chapter 2). This meant the game was a lot tougher than it needed to be, but also a lot more rewarding, as I had to master the not so easy to learn intricacies of combat in Risen. However, even with armor, I found the monsters a challenge throughout the game, and at no point did I find I could just rush through any opponent. Some block, some rush, some dodge your attacks and leap towards you, and some sidestep you in the middle of your attack and come at you from the side. Some still parry your blows and counter them. And of course some just use brute force. The game also likes to throw packs at you, almost never allowing you to fight a single monster at a time, but often up to 6 or even 8. It forces you to plan ahead, and know your terrain and so on, which makes for a great and memorable experience.The game lasted me around 37 hours, and I am blown away over how great it was. There were hardly any bugs. In fact the only bugs I came across were me getting stuck on terrain after having jumped where I shouldn't jump, or just getting unlucky with landing a couple of times. I could count the number of times it happened on 1 hand though, and with the amount of quicksaving this game forces you to do, it was never a problem. I'm amazed how well polished the game was. You could argue that it's an older game, but that doesn't mean anything in terms of bugs. Most games never fix even the most horrendous bugs if they don't catch it in the first few patches, so this was both surprising, and gratifying.I could write volumes about the story and the locations you visit, but as I don't want to spoil things, I'll just say that it's one of those stories that starts you off with a blank slate, where you don't know anything about anything to begin with, and you soon have to rescue the world type of scenarios. Don't get me wrong, the story was actually ok, and the game forces you to choose sides rather early in the game. I did not regret my decision, but I do kinda wish I could see the other part. I have read it makes very little difference, and it's just a few quests which all end in chapter 1, but I'm not about to replay the game just to experience an hours worth of quests, so no matter.All in all it was a really enjoyable experience, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone. Just be warned, it is not one of those mainstream games where you can breeze through. The combat is tough as nails, and nobody is going to hold your hand. If you played Gothic and liked it, chances are you will love this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Will update as I progressWhat I Like?- RPG: Inventory, Trading, Dialogue, Enemies, NPC, Collecting herbs, Cooking food, Lock-picking, etc- Pirate-Themed: Ship-werecked, pirates, ships, etc- Combat: Enemies have unique fighting styles; some melee fights can require endurance and patience (defend, watch, attack), where one false move may finish you off, but you may need many more hits- Graphics: The landscapes and environment look beautifully designed- Audio: The sound and dialogue is fun and interesting; plenty of options to choose from- The characters seem well integrated into the environment and adds to the atmosphere; You really feel that it's an organic community with power struggles, issues and people living their daily lives.Neutral- High Inventory: This may be a con for some users, but sometimes I prefer a game where I don't need to agressively manage inventory; I am not entirely sure whether its ""unlimited""- Steamworks Integration: Steam Trading Cards, etcWhat I Wish it Had:- Shorter Loading Times: It takes relaively long to load up saved games- It's a pretty refreshing RPG - it wasn't exactly what I was expecting, I was pleasantly surprised by a number of elements and the way the characters were developed, they feel and sound like ""real"" people - thus at times you can really relate to the NPC (Non-Player Characters), and you feel part of the community.

Instead of just picking the best you find you can just target the best weapon and go and get it. This can be addictive but it gets tiring using the same armour for a longer periodConclusionRisen is a great game, it is, but it is also not for everyone. Risen is made by Piranha Bytes which is based in Germany. It is a small studio which is why you cannot expect a big franchise here. Piranha Bytes became famous with Gothic and Risen is Gothic through and through. If you're already a Gothic fan then you probably do not need to get told to buy this game. Unfortunately after Gothic 3 Piranha Bytes got into an argument with their old publisher, Jowood, and the rights of Gothic went to them. Piranha Bytes is a small studio and very passionate about their game which is why this was quite tragic. Gothic 4: Arcania was produced by another studio and became a mess. After Gothic 4 the rights went back to Piranha Bytes but it was too late since the storyline was already ruined with Gothic 4. Risen is an attempt at recreating Gothic from scratch and the game plays exactly like Gothic did.This game is very old-fashioned and inconvenieent. Do you remember old games where just opening the map was annoying but you played it anyway because you get used to it? This is the type of game Risen is. The combat system is annoying when you compare it to other titles where you press a few buttons and you've  gotten a few thousand kills while checking what's on the TV. As a new player you are going to die against any beast until you learn to double-tap S to dodge attacks. If you are someone who enjoys RPGs in general then get this game, you won't regret it. If you are someone who likes RPGs 'as long they're great' then just save yourself the trouble as you'll probably stop playing due to it being too annoying and you're not willing to adapt. If love RPGs then prepare to become part of the franchise as there are already Risen 2 and 3 that will advance in the story. I would rate this game 7/10 for reasons explained above. This is not a bad rating, it just simply is not for everyone. Personally I have greatly enjoyed Risen and am very motivated to begin my adventure in Risen 2: Dark Waters.This game was played at maximum settings on this system:Monitor: BenQ XL2420T[www.amazon.co.uk]GPU: Sapphire Tri-X R9 290[www.scan.co.uk]CPU: Intel Core i5-4670[www.amazon.co.uk]RAM: Kingston HyperX Blu 4x4[www.amazon.co.uk]Motherboard: MSI Z87-G45SSD: Samsung SSD 830[www.amazon.co.uk]If you have any further questions or are still unsure if you should buy it feel free to ask.

												This game took me completly by surprise. I got it with the Deep Silver Humble Bundle a while ago, and it just gathered dust in my Steam library at first, with 0 hours of play time, not thinking it could be anything amazing or out of the ordinary. I was very wrong.Risen is a third-person RPG with a strong story with multiple pathways towards the end and a lot of ways to get rid of your enemies. The combat system got me intrigued after the first Hungry Sea Vulture I had to kill. It's tough, I won't lie, almost every battle is going to be a challenge and will deserve a quicksave, but it's fair and very rewarding. Also, it helps that you can approach combat in a lot of ways, depending on your specialisation, ranging from swords and staffs to magic bullets and bows.The story is quite strong and well thaught, but not necessarily the best. What I appreciated though, is the fact that your actions have a strong impact in the game world, and you actually feel like something has changed. This is helped by the fact that some quest lines have different outcomes, depending on who you choose to help. (The Steelbeard/Romanov/Patty ordeal). You have 2 main story branches that meet somewhere in the middle, after around 10-15 hours. Yes, the game is pretty long, around 25-30 hours. but it never gets boring or repetitive. The replay value is also big. You can play it twice, for both sides of the story, or 4 times for the full combat experience.I whole-heartedly recommend this game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In all my 7 years of steam service I have never write a review. Untill now. But because I never write reviews, I will keep this very short and not go deep into the details.I have very high standards for combat difficulity, so I played Risen on hard mode and finished it today. The combat is the best and most enjoyable combat I have ever seen (together with Dark Souls) and the difficulity and learning curves for talents and fighting styles was just perfect. The way of getting new armor, new weapons, quests and crafting everything was just absolutely amazing and immersive at its best. For me personally, Risen is by far the best rpg single player I have ever played and to be honest I enjoyed Risen more then The Witcher, Dragon Age and other popular rpg games and the graphics of Risen are so enchanting and immersive to me I find it is much better then the most rpg game released even to this date!A quote from a reviewer two days ago:"" But worst of all, and this is unforgivable, it fails to get you to care ""I personally disagree. One of the reason why Risen is my number one rpg is that it compelled me to care so much about every item in my inventory and keeping it organized, keep track of everything I find, every descision I had to make when distributing my skill points, every progress of every quest, every location, I cared for it all like I never had done in any other rpg game. This immersive feeling grabbed me and never left me from the minute I started this game.Risen10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Risen is tailored for a niche audience, the hardcore RPG crowd. If you've never played a Gothic game before, then Risen might be a great place to start--if you know what to expect. Without some explaination, you might find the game a deeply flawed, boring experience or you may grow fond of the game despite its faults. The worst flaw that would otherwise make this a classic is its replayabilty, specifically past Chapter 1.A Beginner's GuideI'm going to save you hours of trouble with some useful tips. One, turn the difficulty down to Easy--trust me, you'll thank me for Chapter 3. (See Padding.)Two, there is always another option. Magic can be just as practical to non-mages to beat the game. Here are some helpful reminders on how to win:Be flexible. (Weapons, magic, talents.)Stay focused. (Find your specialization fast and treat every encounter as a threat.)Explore. (There are many paths--some rewarding, some punishing.)Three, exploit the game's looting mechanic. Whenever you knock down a human NPC, you can steal their stuff and they'll come right back with little to no punishment. (See a good weapon/shield? Take it.)Four, abuse the brewer for gold. In the Swamp, there is someone who will buy weed from you (10 for 70 pieces of gold). You can then beat him down, steal it back and sell  him the same stuff. This is a great way to earn gold if you are lacking funds, and because the game is difficult already I don't feel bad using the exploit. Five, get trained ASAP. The game won't let you max your character out with gold alone. You have to gain XP to earn Learning Points--I don't think there's a max level--which you can then use to earn talents (swords, sneak, etc.) as well as stat increases. Six, focus on talents and stats. Talents are to improve your character itself via better combat skills/animations; stats are to get you better gear. The game expects you to manage both as you'll need counter-parry for Chapter 3 enemies (+7 for Swords) as well as decent gear to deal out enough damage.If you know this information before starting, then you'll have a much better time than most players. The game is intentionally brutal at the start, but it is the good kind of challenge where it relies as much on skill as awareness on your character. Get past that hurdle and you'll find a worthwhile experience in the first chapter of the game.(You're still going to die a lot.)Simple One Button Combat? No.Risen's combat is... complex. That's as nice and as nuanced as I can describe it, and in some ways I think the combat makes Dark Souls feel streamlined in comparison. You can read the attacks of enemies--but the animations are somewhat sporadic and poor. You can use a wide array of attacks--when you unlock them. The game requires you to use your positioning, sometimes, but also mastering the parry system, other times.But that's not what makes this game brutal to something like Dark Souls.Your character's animations are hampered at the start. You will notice a change in combat gameplay from the beginning of the game towards the end, so leveling up your talents and stats is mandatory to win. (Or you can be a bigger masochist.)For example, in the early part of the game, you'll rely on dodging/faking-out enemy attacks than the late-game parrying system. Your animations improve and the enemies require different tactics.This never felt aggrivating because the game felt designed that way.Enemies are not scaled to the player, discouraging players from areas they shouldn't be exploring, and the ones in my way were were reasonable compared to the hordes later on. And compared to the initial enemies, they do become more complicated towards the end--except for the Titan boss fight--that I was required to master my specilizations to win. However, what I don't understand is why the game locks your camera. It works for 1-1 engagements, but clunky when you have to fight multiple enemies at once. If they had enabled it as a lock-on button, then I wouldn't compliain. The other main issue with combat is the lacking variety of enemies. You'll quickly notice color-palatte/text swaps and grow tedious of engagements. (Thankfully, enemies will taunt you before actually attacking you.)These two problems don't detract from the thrill of every engagement, but they are areas of improvement and the monotony of the game is something that becomes a problem once the game falls short of its introduction.It Begins...Whenever people praise Risen for its open-ended routes to play and the wonderful sense of world building, they are usually referring to the first chapter of the game. And there's a good reason why that is the case.In the game's first hours, you find yourself in the conflict between the ""freedom fighters"" of the Don as well as the Inquisition's hold on the island with the mages' Monastary of the Order. Simple enough, right? You may be surprised to know that you actually have three initial paths to choose--all of which have multiple ways of accessing them. And in order to advance to Chapter 2, you have to visit three main areas of the game. Some are based on your choice; others on your failures.For example, you could start by going to Harbour Town (a neutral area). To enter the town, you can bribe the guards to let you in or you can do some farmwork to sneak in. (Or you can be taken away by the guards to the Monastary for being outside the walls.) Once inside, you can do quests for either faction--be sure to choose one side for the best rewards--that will have multiple ways of success.From there, you can either enlist with the Inquisition to get some training (especially for magic) or you can meet with the thieves' leader to find the hidden exit that the Don's men use to  carry out ther operations. You'll either find yourself in the Swamp (the Don's headquarters) or the Monastary. Or you can start out in the Swamp to train your skills and rise up within the ranks doing laborous tasks that can be challenging early in the game. Then you'll recieve orders to find out the situation in Harbour Town and then set up a peace agreement at the Monastary. (This is the route I took for my playthrough.)Or you can be caught by the Order--at any point in the chapter--and forced to enlist.As you can probably tell, there are many alternatives to choose. That's not even talking about the island itself. The island is actually a very contained, expansive environment that has multiple entrances and paths from one side of the island to the other. From Chapter 2 onwards you recieve teleportation stones to save time.While most games would portray one as the noble underdog and the other as the tyrrant, Risen doesn't portray either side as the good side. In fact, no one is the ""good guy"" other than how you portray your character. Unfortunately, the end of the first chapter is where the game begins to fall short of itself.More Padding Than NecessaryChapter 2 -4 suffer from serious padding. I wouldn't have a problem had the game not spammed enemies or deviated me to put me on fetch quests. It doesn't ruin the game, but I have little desire to replay past Chapter 1.I enjoyed the temple quests, but I wished the two factions were relevant. And because the three areas and the factions become forgotten, the game feels more linear than it is.If the game simply condenced these chapters into one, I think it would be a masterpiece.""Rising Up, Back On the Street...""Funny enough, the Eye of the Tiger is an apt way to describe the ""thrill"" of Risen. For every failure, you learn something new--and that's the essential thing Risen does right.I wonder how many people will be forgiving of this game in a post-Steam refund world. It's a slow-burner RPG that warms the heart with enough time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Another old-school RPG from Piranhas. I always loved Gothic and this is his spiritual successor. You have whole island to discover, you can do quests for every fraction you want, smithing, hunting, magic, fighting, nobody tells you what you must do for progress in story. In current time, there's not so understanding for RPGs like this, but for old Gothic players (like me) it's a great reminder of legendary Piranha Bytes games. 76/100			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game gets a lot of hate and I don't know why. It's kind of like Morrowind, but with voice acting and different combat. You're just thrown on to this island without any handholding. You have to earn respect and start as a lowlife commoner. The game will often trick you with unfortunate scenarios. Overall, I'd say it's worth buying on sale. 7.5/10 for me			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ah yes, the good old days of ""hardcore"" RPGs. This is a great game, if you loved Gothic 1 & 2, you will enjoy this immensely. The world is very well crafted and exploration is a huge part of this. Most importantly, it is what makes this game so good (hidden passages or secrets, loot which you will want to explore. I roamed the world for hours instead of doing the story related quests).I played this on Hard difficulty and often found myself getting owned, especially when I was getting sloppy in combat - 1 or 2 mistakes and you are eating dirt. That is a very refreshing thing in the age of ""easy mode everything"". The combat is decent and challenging almost till the end. However, it has some issues (targeting and monsters strangey dodging attacks even though you attack from the side or back etc.). That would be one of my only complaints. The game also doesn't take your hand and show you everything, you have to find out yourself (or read internet guides a lot).The quests are also really good. One could complain that they only involve kicking butt and / or bribing someone, but there are multiple solutions to almost every quest and a lot of interesting choices. I also really like the gathering / crafting system, which is almost identical to the Gothic games - you will gather herbs and other materials in the world, but they are not a big, shining object which you will immediately notice. You will have to work hard to gather good stuff, but it is fun and well worth it.This is a must-play for any fan of RPGs of old.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Risen is a third-person action RPG that places you on a gorgeous and mysterious desert island named Faranga that's plagued by earthquakes and thunderstorms.Like in every Piranha Bytes game, you start out as a nameless protagonist. He survived a shipwreck and he's essentially a clean canvas that you have to build on. This allows you to think up a name and background for him (if you're one of those people who loves to make up stories and use your imagination), and your ideas will never be disproved during the game because neither the character's name nor his past is ever brought up.Almost right off the bat you're told that sooner or later you'll need to join a faction, either the bandits in the Swamp Camp, who are outlaws and rebels in a sense, or the warriors or the mages of the Order of the Holy Flame that is now in control of the whole island. The bandits use swords, maces, axes and bows; the Order's warriors fight with staves and use a bit of magic; and the Order's mages mainly use magic but can do a fair bit of staff fighting as well. This basically gives you different approaches to playing through the game and offers some replay value because picking a side gives you a different perspective on things. But everything still leads up to the same conclusion.Pros:- A gorgeous island with lots of places to explore, treasures to find and monsters to fight. Most of the things that you find on the island are useful to you in some way, so exploration really pays off.- Killing a monster who you were too weak to take out before is quite satisfying.- In addition to doing more damage, you also acquire some new moves whenever you improve your fighting skills, and mages' spells become more powerful with each spell level.- Beautiful and memorable soundtrack.- The game takes about 30+ hours to complete which is a pretty decent amount of time for a rather linear type of RPG. There are 4 chapters overall.- A lot of the NPCs are quite interesting and seem to have distinct personalities, even if your interactions with some of them are rather brief.- All of the enemies (and even the animals!) dodge attacks, try to flank you or gang up on you etc, which makes the combat challenging and encourages you to stay alert.Cons:- A few of the side quests might require you to do some research beforehand to get them done right because it's easy to f*ck things up by saying or doing the wrong thing.- Some bugs here and there that haven't been fixed to this day but, as far as I know, there aren't any game breaking ones. The latest unofficial patch has fixed some of them as well.- The island might be a bit too small for players who prefer an RPG with a huge open world.- Some might view the protagonist being a clean canvas as there being no real depth to him as a character.- Choices don't have any real consequences.- Learned skills can not be reset.- During the course of the game you find out about the real threat to the island and the people living on it but you never really *see* it. Some could argue that this adds an air of mystery and foreboding to the game but I just started to take the threat less seriously as time went on.- Lots of quicksaving and reloading that may become tedious.I enjoyed Risen despite all of the abovementioned cons. I think that this game has a lot to offer to any RPG fan and it definitely deserves a lot more attention than it got.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gothic 1 & 2 were great! Even Gothic 3 with all its bugs. A shame what happened with the actual Gothic 4 aka. Arcania.For me Risen is the real Gothic 4 with a temporary ending of the Gothic series and a new start into the new world of Risen.Story: 8/10.Characters: 9/10.The voice acting, typical for Piranha Bytes, is more than awesome! (I played it in german). 5000/10.Battlesystem is pretty good: 9/10.Quests & Dialogues: 10/10.The difficulty could be harder but meh.. The World is big, there is so much to collect and I would hate it if I always meet stronger enemys than me.You can choose between several fractions to play through the story. The Main story won't change with the choice of your fraction, but the most of the quests you have to do will. It's a pretty dynamic atmosphere.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												9/10+ fantastic atmosphere, great music, one of my favorite soundtracks+ open world, many side quests, path to choose (meaning class actually), lots to do generally+ great main story, although a bit too much at the end+ fighting feels satisfactory once you master it- bad voice acting, bad animations (they have to change that jump, it's ridiculous as in gothic games)- fighting feels tedious in the beginning, but becomes better after you level upthis, like gothic games, is all about the atmosphere, you either love it or hate it, i think risen is as good as gothic 1+2 and those who loved those games will certainly love risen as well			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I honestly didn't think I would enjoy a time consuming aged RPG after all this time.  This game definitely has a very unforgiving level of difficulty (especially for melee fighters) that is unusual for games today and plenty of interesting characters.  I did have a good time playing the game and ""working"" through it but some of the downsides include: repetitive backtracking, abusable ranged combat, predictable storyline, and far too simple puzzle mechanics.  On the other hand being a power warrior wielding a two-handed sword in one hand (a trained perk) alongside a shield, a crossbow strapped to my back with a slew of magical scrolls ready (for those not trained as mages) was an enjoyable sight.  Would recommend the game to anyone looking for a semi-difficult RPG action-adventure game, who doesn't mind not having everything handed to them on a silver platter.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Risen (1) was a very interesting adventure for me. Growing up playing RPGs like Oblivion or Skyrim, I was never introduced into the more hardcore-ish subgenre. So naturally, it came as a surprise when the 1st creature I met was able to kill me in 4-5 hits, while I was still figuring out how attacking works. After finishing the game, with every quest except a few teleport stones left to acquire done, I was overrun by a sense of joy for finally getting rid of those Lizardmen (read: angry lizard DEVILS that don't care how much health you have and will still kill you in 1 combo because God doesn't love you), but at the same time a sense of regret for not exploring that road that I saw by chance, that I didn't take because i had something else to do, etc. This is pretty much the entire pace of the game: You arrive on an island (read: crash in a very violent way) and wake up on a beach, with nothing but a stick and a useless female by your side, who you will ditch in the first 10 minutes of the game, never to see her again. From there, anything you do is guided only by your sense of curiosity and the choices you make. Some choices may be better, some may net you more gold, and some may help a poor woman survive through her illness, but what it matters is that its YOUR choice. By spending hours and hours travelling that island, killing those ANNOYING wolves that just DONT QUIT, you start to somehow love it, and want to see its people be safe and happy. As seen in Skyrim, although this game is older, there is a moral choice that you must make between two factions at war, the Imperia.....uhm...Inquisition and the Don. Just like in Skyirm, one is looking out for the greater good on the long run of the whole population, while the other is looking out to its individuals just in the present. As always, there's fanatics, there's people who only care about money, and people who just want to be annoying (I'm looking at you, Romanov. Even  I had more gold on me than what was in that damned chest that everyone was fussing about.)There's a lot of ups and downs in this game, the ups in the likes of finding a new awesome looking weapon/armor, and the downs being finding out that you STILL get 2-shotted by lizardmen because why not.The quests are by no means boring from making you explore dungeons to having you fight Undead Lords for their rings to gathering that all-important Weed.As a conclusion to my non-coherent review that says, in a lot of words, absolutely nothing, I would recommend this game to anyone with some spare time and a LOT of patience/skill. Its a great game, with a decent storyline and somewhat vast somewhat interesting world filled with somewhat annoying monsters that are somewhat repetitive.And remember, dodging is your friend. Your ONLY friend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Risen, like most of Piranha Bite's previous efforts, is kind of a misinterpreted RPG. First of all, the game doesn't just throw you into the world knowing certain basic skills (like sneaking, pickpocketing, lock-picking, etc). Anyone expecting ""Skyrim with pirates"" is going to be terribly disappointed, not because Risen is a bad game in itself, but because it's made to appeal a hardcore RPG crowd that enjoys games with more depth on characters, quest completion, exploration and looting. Risen excels in adding depth to all these elements, but that's not without its obvious flaws. Combat, while rewarding, feels excessively clunky. The camera usually tends to go a bit crazy when tackling with more than one enemy and animations look unnatural. It isn't until you begin to train on fighting skills and learn decisive combat moves like parrying when it starts to get fun and challenging. During the first couple of hours you're going to feel really lost. Without the help of quest markers you're going to have to find out how to continue with the quest on your own, which encourages you to rely on yourself instead of following a guided path with the help of a medieval GPS tracking system. There are no exclamation or interrogation marks on top of people's heads, so talking to them and finding out is the only way to begin quests. Memorizing where each character lives/works is recommended because you'll go back to them again and again on different missions, though Risen doesn't make that process easy either since almost all of the characters look exactly alike with some exceptions like hair color or clothes. Instead, you'll remember them because they each serve a different purpose in the community they belong to and feel like an important part of the world. Certainly, what I'm enjoying most about the game is the decision making. The island is mainly divided into three factions: The Inquisition who believe the artefacts from the temples that have just risen should be kept away because of the unknown power that lies within them; the Don's Men, who don't believe that the artefacts have any hidden power and instead want to loot these temples to sell them for gold; and the novices and mages who were trained by the Inquisition but do not want to become part of the Order; they sort of go by their own principles. The conflicts between both opposing factions are shown throughout the whole game and you will constantly be asking yourself which is actually the one you feel at ease with. The Inquisition, while imposing very restrictive laws and obliging every foreigner to enlist as a Warrior of the Order, certainly has a point when it comes to keeping the artefacts safe in case they have some hidden power. The Don, while being much less restrictive and welcoming, are all petty thieves who abuse shop owners for ""protection"" money. Each of them tries to lure you into joining their forces and give very good arguments (for example, the Don's men constantly tell you how the Inquisition doesn't really care about the island or the poor, while these same people are extorting money and commiting terrible crimes; on the other hand, the Inquisition still preaches about saving the people but are still very restrictive in certain aspects). When it comes to the looting system in this game, it isn't bad nor impressive either, it just serves its purpose: you collect things and then if you're experienced enough you can craft something with them. Graphically, the game is a hit and miss. The environments are lush and vibrant with life. The jungles look impressive because of the amount of vegetation everywhere, and shader/shadow effects look great too. Still, pop-up textures are fairly common here and there and characters look somewhat ugly. With all this said, Risen makes up for a believable and immersive experience due mainly to its story, its characters, and its rewarding quest-making, but can only be enjoyed if you can overlook its flaws.

												TL:DR? You decide.The short: I found it fun and was often immersed and highly entertained. Since playing, I find that I look for similar games more often than others. I believe most will find this to be a fun game despite any flaws or annoyances they may stumble upon.So, this is my first Steam review and I've chosen a slightly older one. However, it is the Steam game that I've invested the most hours thus far. As a disclaimer, I'll add that while I do pay attention to and even, at times, hope for the myriad of things you'll see listed in some of the best Steam game reviews such as depth of story/immersion, mechanics, controls, etc., I am often quite easily entertained. Let's just say that many of my favorite movies are far from Oscar material. I focus mostly on distraction and fun.You really only need peek at the number of hours played to know that I thoroughly enjoyed Risen and recommend it. The graphics are good enough to keep me from cringing and closing it. I actually enjoyed the music and voice acting, especially Lena Headey, many of the quests and NPC interactions and even exploring and collecting.The few things I found a bit disheartening were the finite number of foragables, the tapering off of NPC interaction as the game progresses and quests are completed, Andy Serkis did not have a flemmy-cat with a furball-cough at all and last but most definitely not least, the amount of rain in the swamps!

												This game was a surprise for me. I never played a similar RPG game.+ beautiful graphics, especially sky and lighting+ very immersive. it feels like you are in a real world, not playing a game+ your actions and decisions really matter. I played Fallout 3 and Oblivion, they cannot compare at all+ if you want to see all the content, you will need to play the game twice+ very good, often humorous dialogs and voice acting+ game is difficult, I like that game does not tell you everything you need to do. Unlike other games, this game requires you to think and learn by trying- downside is, that the game is quite time consumingI think the game is a must have for any RPG fan.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Risen is the spiritual child of the Gothic series; if you know that series you'll find them similar.  Playing Risen reminds me most of Gothic 2; the similarities are enough that I almost wanted to drop this and just play Gothic 2 instead.Fortunately I didn't because Risen definitely has it's own thing going on, and I can heartily recommend trying it.  The story is good and fits well with the world the developers created.  Additionally, Risen has the difficulty properly balanced through the entire game; combat still provides a challenge even in the last 5 hours of the adventure.What I love most about Risen is the exploration, finding lost little corners with hidden treasures and goodies.  I am also a sucker for games with alchemy.  When it goes on sale why not give it a try?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Risen is like Gothic 1 with good graphics. Outstanding soundtrack (thank you Kai Rosenkranz), good combat, scenery and exploration. But it also includes some problems of the predecessor, like your faction not making any impact on the story since the game takes a single narrow path after Chapter 2. Some quests like ""Collect 5 pieces to continue"" (Which was actually good in Gothic 1) make you want to drop the game. But it's still a lot of fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: August 7, 2016
												My my, friend; you're in an odd part of steam now aren't you? Welcome to Risen, a truly mystifying game by our friends Piranha Bytes.See, I have a weird stiffy for ♥♥♥♥♥♥ adventure RPGs like Risen. I've played some of Gothic 3, I've watched lets plays of Two Worlds, I've experienced babby's first OHS(first Witcher), and I've a past time of exploiting physics glitches in the elder scrolls series.So I'll be rating by five categories: Graphics, Leveling, Ambience, Gameplay, and Story:First up, Greficks:Visually, Risen is appealing and fully cranked has nice material effects on the items you wear. Everything has texturing and react well to ambient light. For example when you finally get an iron helmet it shines like it was really worked over with a hammer at a forge. Whoah, it's like we're playing a moden game! Some of the models look samey but there are enough human models and reskins of those models to make most characters you meet seem like they're different people. Monsters sometimes literally are green versions of other models with maybe a horn plastered on. meh:Second, Leveling:Leveling is done unexpectedly well in this game. When I say leveling I mean the developers putting monsters along paths that subtly coralle you to the way you're supposed to go. It's terrific because this negates the need for different difficulty levels. At the beginning gnomes gave me trouble and Sea Vultures fatigued me greatly and Ghouls hand delivered dread to my soul with their op shield breaking frost attacks. This isn't a game where you just run into weapons and armor like it's growing on trees, every weapon you replace your old one with is well earned, or bought for an exorbitant sum. I played a melee sword n board character for my first time through and when I beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of Brogar and took his spiked mace I felt like a badass to end all badasses then I got my butt opened fighting 10 grave moths in the same area.But that's the thing, it's a game of raising the level of good that you are with whatever you're using to kill stuff. Later, monsters will use advanced tecniques like strafing and counterblocking. Not just 4 chain hits like the spiked rats do when you're barely level 2. The map opens up in piecemeal because of this and imo gives a very satisfying rate of progression because you can go anywhere(mostly) at any time but good luck killing that ogre with a stick you found on the ground m80. B)Also, you learn new tecniques as well, but you actually have to go learn them. When you level up you get Learning Points that you can use -along with gold- to get a trainer to teach you new stuff. Like reloading c'bows faster or more chains for your sword combo. It's freakin cool and prevents all-rounders but allows for some cool multiclass builds. Like my character besides being buffman mcswordswing could brew potions. So I brewed 50 str pots and killed thick jaw sausage fingers in 3 hits it was a very big letdown honestly.Save often.:Third, Ambience:This is a weird category but I feel like I need to say something about it. The reason I didn't lump with with graphics is because you can have ambience without good graphics I mean just look at morrowind. The lighting in this game is done gorgeously, the colors are perfect for their respective areas that lends a real feeling of being in a swamp, or a muggy little town, or on a fortress laden road build into a huge cliffside at dusk. It's very pretty. Roads are winding in places where you'd expect and wide like u're mum in others. Foliage is used well to hide things and there are some cozy little areas that with a keen eye and a levitation spell you can get to(I'm looking at you, Doyle!):Fourth, Gameplay:Risen is an odd beast; it's not floopy and doofy like Gothic, it's strangely stoic and awkward. The animations are stilted and make Bethesda's look decent. I thought I was playing a game from 2009 not Runescape 2. Like Runescape though they have a certain charm about them. For example, you can break down certain walled off doorways later in the game with a pickaxe. The swings you make look like they couldn't tickle yer mum let alone break down a huge stone door, but it makes me smile when the pieces of door explode from their berth like you used a depthcharge and not a sternly worded pickaxe tap. Idle dialogue animations are hilarious and make it look like you're watching a school play animated by todd howard.:Fifth, Story:Here's the kicker for me, honestly. Though before I go into the story proper I'd like to mention the character you play. He's the biggest bumbler I've ever had as a main character. His dialogue, his stature, animations, dying noises, it all contributes to the image of a man that has no idea what he's doing. Even when I had my strength at 166 and could wield a two hander with a shield I never felt like I was some cooked up hero. I felt like I was learning along with this guy, that beating the impossible just took a few hours of learning the counter-counterblock.The story though, left me deflated. Honestly most of this game seems like the devs stumbled into cool mechanics and ideas but they got no breaks with the main story points. The ending was abysmal and left me wanting when it dumped me back at the main screen with no aftergame to ♥♥♥♥ about in with my op quest armor. The villains that were hyped up were pushovers and honestly the grunts gave me the most trouble. Honestly I think I died most to wild animals out of everything that killed me. The good thing is, that there's replayability. I barely touched anything relating to magic except near the endgame where you're forced to use levitation and telekinesis spells but you have scrolls for that and if you're a fighter you have a bunch of mana pots you're not using anyway.Overall, I recommend Risen for the journey and goofiness along the way to the major plot points because the peaks in the story are very uninspired and full of mcguffins. The ending is♥♥♥♥♥♥ just like the conclusion of this review. I'll probably play it again though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Piranha's finest and maybe their best title. Despite a rather small size of the island, every location brims with love and effort spent into creating it. The world feels complete, no unnecessary detail, no location out of place. The combat is engaging and the progression keeps this going well into the endgame, where you might get tired a bit from the final enemy types, particularly if you want all experience.Why a thumbs down, then?The game is abandoned and unoptimized for newer versions of OS. This becomes particularly evident on the second playthrough, when you can run out of memory. The only way to fix it is to patch the executable with a program, which will bring it's virtual memory use potential up to 4 GB, in line with 64-bit systems. And guess what, you can't do that with a Steam Risen executable. People on the forums tried to contact the devs/publishers about the issue without success. There are still some very annoying issues in the game, that could be easily addressed by the devs, but never were. I highly suggest you get the unofficial patch from the World of Risen website. A lot of users on the forums report being unable to start the game due to gfx-related problem. I had it too, I think you manually have to change the resolution in the ini file to match your monitor's to make it work, but I'm not completely sure. No support, no Steam cloud, existing in-game achievements never mirrored. You get the picture.So, would I recommend you play Risen, especially if you're Gothic fan - oh God, yes, absolutely.There is no need to get Steam version for that, though.			",278,133,5,50,28,3,54

												Risen is definitly an old school RPG, in that nothing, I repeat NOTHING is spoon fed to you. At best, you get a couple of generic markers for the general location of where you may need to go for some quests, but for the most part it is entirely up to you to keep track of who is who, where people and places are at, and what you need to do next. Unlike games such as Skyrim, in Risen you are forced to figure almost everything out for yourself. Quests take awhile to finish, and are arched out rather than radiant so that you don't feel as if you are repeatedly doing the same stuff over and over. Hours will fly by as you wander about the island and learn how to progress.Combat is on the wonky side, and can take a bit to get to learn. Many creatures have attacks that are, IMO, a bit too fast and overpowered, and require a little more than just skill to get through. However, there are many things you can take advantage of in order to make it though the combat system. Graphics wise, i would say that the game has aged considerably well. While most textures arent remarkable or even close to realistic, they are far from being immersion breaking or ugly. In fact. some areas are quite beautiful, and the soundtrack is one of the best from the time. If you have a short attention span, or don't have much experience with RPGs in general, this game may not be the best place for you to get your feet wet. However,  with how often these games go on sale I would highly suggest that you put at least a couple of hours into the game.As a side note: there is a special place in hell for gnomes. Screw you, you short ugly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I haven't played Gothic, but I've heard Risen is more or less a reboot/rehash of Gothic I and II.This being said, if you've never played Gothic, here's what to expect from Risen :The game starts just as I like them : Thrown in an unknown island after the ship you sailed with got wrecked in what appeared to be a storm, you're given a weapon, a couple of items and here you roll.The game's an action-rpg, so the combat is both important and reflex-based.There are three factions you can side with in order to get their exclusive stuff (usually, the armor) and each faction puts the emphazis on some specific skills (The rebels are about hunting and thievery since they're cast out of the city and living in the swamp, The inquisitor's followers put the emphazis on staff-wielding, the mages are ♥♥♥♥ing mages) while most skills are available everywhere (weapons, crafting etc).Most npcs from the three hubs (The rebel camp, the Monastery and the city) will react to events regarding the island or yourself (been promoted captain of the Don ? Here go the salutes from the troops) which is great.The combat system gets good as you unlock skill levels in a type of fighting.Now for the problems :Risen tends to copy/paste encounters in the last part of the game. To the point of being absolutely awfully boring. You'll fight reptilian undead again and again and again.Itemization is pretty straight-forward. Better weapons usually mean more damage and require more stats. Don't expect anything fancy. Even the massive legendary end-game weapon is actually a regular axe with a regular moveset.In addition to copy/pasted encounters, have some copy/pasted quests ! Not only will you have to reckon the island to recover the necessary artifacts for the main quest to keep on at chapter II, you'll have to do it again at chapter IV !Overall though, it's mostly good. The end-game is very tedious though as I said but the experience you'll have is very satisfactory, mostly due to the different possiblities of progression (working for the don, being captured by the inquisitor's men, asking the mages to take you in) and the different quests you'll have in the different factions.Concerning the story, which I haven't really talked about, it got two axises : the first one is the struggle for the control of the island. This one is cool. The other one is the actual main story and, let's just say it's both cliché and boring.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Risen is a third-person action RPG game from the creators of the gothic-series (Piranha Bytes) in which we are a pirate. The combat system is boring but realistic. Each monster has a different way of defeating him other than just mashing the attack button. Lots of interesting things to do but they don't hold your hand in figuring it out, most of the time you are on your own. If you played Gothic and liked it, chances are that you will love this game.

												This is how Gothic 3 game should be made. Risen feels more like Gothic game than Gothic 3 will ever do.I love Pyranha Bytes games. The third Gothic game maybe disappointed me a little but what they did with Risen game... wow. It feels so much like first Gothic game. I felt once again like a kid playing first Gothic game when it was out. It's simply amazing. Great atmosphere, great soundtrack, great graphics and open world which you want to explore. The story is fits fine for RPG game, characters and their stories are interesting and once again, you will need to decide whose fraction you will join. While fighting you feel respect towards monsters - you might know that from Gothic games but if you don't: one wrong move and you can lose your life. It starts rather easy, with a chance to encounter a ""run for your life"" monster and ends at ""I want to run away from these dangerous beasts but I have no choice and I must fight it"". If I can complaing about something...... yes, there are things in this almost perfect RPG game I didn't like much. Most annoying thing which made me start game again and again was jumping on platforms and climbing - I'M NOT SURE WHAT I'M DOING WRONG, BUT WHY IS MY HERO FLYING TOWARDS SKY AND NOT COMING BACK, BUGGING WHOLE MENU. THE ONLY WAY TO FIX IT WAS TO EXIT GAME, START IT AGAIN AND LOAD LAST SAVE. Much later at game I bought over9000 levitation scrolls to avoid this annoying bug. While bugs are bugs, Risen have one thing which I'm really disappointed at. Like I said earlier, characters and their stories are interesting but they don't really feel anything towards main character. I didn't feel any friendships at all, nobody I could count on, nobody I could remember this much like some of first Gothic characters - and it's not only limited to friends, but enemies too. Maybe it's only me, maybe it's because I played this way not another.... dunno.Spending almost 50 hours in Risen and finishing it for the first time, I feel like there are still many things I left not finished and not discovered. Risen's world is big one, and playing a fine RPG game like this only once is really waste. There are also in game achievements, which can also count as reason to play Risen after beating game. I know I will be back one day to Risen and enjoy it like for the first time. Or maybe even more.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After the technical disaster of Gothic 3, Piranha Bytes left their estranged publisher, JoWood, with the Gothic franchise. JoWood proceeded to prove that the failure was their own fault, by releasing the unspeakable horror that was Gothic 3: Forsaken Gods, and the complete snoozer that was Arcania: Gothic IV.Meanwhile, Piranha Bytes started from the ground up with a new world, new story, and new publisher, and gave us Risen, an RPG which restored faith in their ability to provide an essential open-world fantasy RPG. It's not perfect, but compared to Gothic 3, it is a masterstroke. The combat is skillful, though the auto lock-on can be a bit irritating. The variety of spells adds more interesting options to combat and exploration. The NPC's are all well-written and acted, including characters voiced by film veterans Andy Serkis, John Rhys-Davies, and Lena Headey. The world is not to Elder Scrolls scale, but is full of hidden loot, challenging enemies, and sprawling yet expertly designed dungeons. Altogether, the game stands as a supreme tribute to the first two Gothic games that made Piranha Bytes a revolutionary figure in the RPG genre back in the years around 2000.Pretty much the only thing I really disliked about this game was how much it got me to love it. Unfortunately, due to questionable decisions and a hope to really try something new, Piranha Bytes sunk the franchise into relative mediocrity with Risen 2: Dark Waters, only to be slightly redeemed in Risen 3: Titan Lords.

												For Piranha Bytes, Risen was a clean slate. After Gothic 3 was a total debacle at launch due to their publisher, JoWooD, meddling with the development and basically ripping the game from their hands before it was finished to meet a launch date, PB cut all ties with the series that put them on the map. Signing up with Deep Silver, Risen was constructed, from the ground up, to be an evolution of the formulas and gameplay loops found in Gothic, while also targeting console players with a multi-platform release. Risen succeeds in a lot of what it sets out to do.  However, there are still some missteps, especially in the latter parts of the game.The story takes place on Faranga, a mediterranean island, where after humanity cast out the ruling gods (a reference to one of the endings of Gothic 3), massive ruins begin to rise out of the ground all over the world and deadly creatures begin to pour out, forcing humanity into conflict once again. To make matters worse, massive storms are wreaking havoc on any kind of settlement or ship out in the oceans, which is where the nameless player character comes in. After stowing away on a boat commanded by a militant theocratic order known as the Inquisition, the player shipwrecks onto the island along with one other survivor and has to figure out what is going on. The player is given a choice between siding with three different factions in three different massive areas full of side quests and characters, and this is something Risen does really well, almost to the degree of Gothic 2. The settlements all ooze atmosphere, whether it be the bandit camp in the swamps or the Inquisition monastery high up in the peaks of an active volcano, they all have distinct character and feel like real places and much of the early game is spent in these areas. After picking a faction, the game begins to settle into a rhythm of exploring ruins, doing some light puzzle solving and finding the plot device of the day. While this can get rote after a while, the game is still very much enjoyable and the story is intriguing enough where I was playing just to see what happens next. There are some great characters in Risen too, especially the Inquisitor himself (voiced by Andy Serkis), Don Estaban (voiced by John Rhys-Davies), the crime lord leader who was exiled out of Harbor Town by the Inquisition and Patty (voiced by Lena Heady), a tavern owner who is looking for her lost father. However, where the game lets itself down, is in the combat. Now, YMMV but I never quite got the hang of how combat works in Risen and would often resort to cheesy tactics in the later game when the difficulty curve begins to rapidly spike up. Even with endgame gear, enemies were still able to stun lock me with ease and decimate me without breaking a sweat. It's possible I didn't build my character right, but it was often frustrating dealing with the combat. However, it didn't make me want to stop playing. Speaking of character building, the learning points system from Gothic makes a comeback and it's relatively unchanged from how it was used in previous games. When you level up, you get ten learning points and use them to learn skills from trainers (along with a little bit of gold for good measure). A really enjoyable part of this system is that each trainer has different lines for how they teach you something like how to swing a sword, with each having their own take and personality on it, though this ultimately makes no difference in terms of gameplay.Risen is also quite a looker, with a very strong mediterranean themed art style throughout and well-done lighting. Characters don't look super hot in 2016, but it's still far better then, say, ArcaniA, which came out two years later. The game also runs very well on modest PC's, and more higher end specs can utilize tools like nVidia Inspector to add in anti-aliasing. At 2x SSAA, this is quite a great looking game.I highly recommend checking this out if you are a fan of the Gothic games or of European CRPG's in general!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An oldie but a real goodie. And I've had this game for a long time. I always started it, got distracted, and didn't go back to it. Then I started it, got distracted, .... Well, you know the drill. I finally decided that this time when I started it, unless I got to the point where I really thought it stunk, I was going to finish it, regardless. Well, I finally did finish it and I truly enjoyed my experience. Once I got going, I found the game pulling me back and really looking forward to my free time to play it. It's a fun, charming game, in it's own way, but it's also fairly challenging and serious. (I also own Risen II and III, neither of which I've touched. So now, I'm looking forward to them both very much.)The game does a good job leading you along to the point of having freedom of choice, but not feeling lost. And it really does offer you a lot choice... Who you ally with, who you tick off, what type of character build you want, where you are going to go next... There are a few minor details that can pass you by, but the game is so mature (old) now, there are tons of references for guidance on the Internet.Anyway, in the spirit of keeping this short, I highly recommend this game. Like I said, it's older, but certainly well worth the $10 price tag. Buy it, start it, and uh ... stick with it!  :)  It'll offer you a LOT of entertainment for the money!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Spiritual successor to between RPG lovers very famous Gothic series. This little RPG from Piranha Bytes embodies pretty much everything you could ever want as a hardcore player and presents it in quite modern and very likeable fashion. Slow and tactical combat is still there, monsters are insanely brutal and quests very long. Only bigger con of this game is fairly weak ending, which forces you to run around the whole island(probably already totally explored) chasing bits of gear for the last boss fight that is more of a jumping and platforming puzzle than actual fight. Other than that, it’s very well made action RPG, 8/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I strongly recommend this game to anyone that likes RPGs but I warn you, THIS GAME TAKES SKILL! You actually fight. Timing while dodging, blocking and parrying are a big part of the game so expect to die, a lot cause it's not easy.Also, there are several different playthroughs depending on the choices you make.

												Risen 1 is a great RPG game. Overall, I think it's the third best out of 6 games from the devs of Gothic. (Gothic and Gothic 2 are the better ones).I played this game for the first time when it was released back in 2009. Haven't played it since then, even barely remembered what the story was, what were the good or bad things. I just finished this game on the hardest difficulty (as a mage this time) and I enjoyed this playthrough sooo much! But the very end (the last few chapters) was a bit tedious and grindy.I know that many players who are unfamiliar with the Gothic gameplay mechanics and how unforgivable these games are - can get a bit frustrated about the way the combat works or how it's hard to know where to go or what to do (especially when you start the game). But I never had a problem with those things, I think that's what makes these games (Gothic/Risen) unique to all the others. I really enjoy the beginning of these games where even a single herb or arrow can make the difference. The character building is enjoyable and challenging.+Still good graphics for a 7y old game.+Amazing voice acting.+Amazing music! +Ambient sounds and sound effects are perfect. You really feel like you are there, in that world. It makes it very believable.+Controls are pretty good too.+Long game. ~50h if you like to complete every quest, kill every enemy and so on.+Tombs and caves are well done and creepy.+Rewards players who like to explore the world.+Many different NPCs with different personalities.+Multi-layered quests.-Attack spells (utility spells are good) are a bit lackluster. There should have been more variety. They are fun to use, but you want to have more than 4.-Bugs. There are a big variety of those. Sometimes you get stuck near the ledges just because. Especially late game.-Lack of variety of enemies at the last 1/3 of the game.-That freakin' sea monster.-Nights are too dark and tombs and caves sometimes can be nearly pitch black. So prepare your torches or use the light spell, you'll definitely need it, many times.-Too few NPCs that you can find outside of cities or camps. And a tip for everyone: SAVE OFTEN AND A LOT. Save before/after talking to an npc, after killing creatures or turning in quests. And after many other things. This will save your nerves and you will not need to waste more time doing the same stuff if you f*cked up or misclicked something.Oh and another tip. Don't be ashamed to use some guides if you get stuck or want to know more about some stuffs. Will save your time and/or will quicken your decision making.+It's very cheap on sales. So grab it, it's well worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Risen is a third person open world action roleplaying game made by the team that gave us the Gothic games, and it shows. It is very much like Gothic 1 & 2. Characteristic features of these games are:- Exciting melee combat: just spam-clicking the mouse will get you nowhere, you need to actually think and time your moves (blocking, parrying, hitting). This is a challenging game, maybe even difficult for some.- Learning curve for your character: there isn't just a learning curve for the player but for the character, too. He needs to learn to fight better. As the game progresses and you level up, you actually feel your character get better. At first, his fighting style is pretty clumsy and you can barely kill a wolf. But later on, you'll fight with more style and finesse, and you can start killing stronger monsters that you had to avoid before.  - Factions: there are three factions you can join. Each faction has their own set of preferred skills, weapons and armor. This adds to replayability. Playing a mage type character will be a completely different experience from playing a sword-and-shield type character.- Trainers: when you level up somewhere in the middle of the forest, you don't just 'learn' new skills or get stronger or more dexterous right there out of the blue. Instead, you'll need to visit a trainer who can teach you to get better or who can teach you new skills.- Great atmosphere: the settings, the NPCs, the music, the different 'hubs' for the factions, ... everything adds to a distinct atmosphere that only Piranha Bytes can create. Although I must admit I think Gothic 1 & 2 had even more 'heart' than Risen, it's there at its core. Risen has what Gothic 3 lacked and what made Gothic 1 & 2 the timeless classics they are today.Note about achievements: this game has achievements but they aren't visible in Steam, only in the game itself. From the game menu, click 'Game' and then 'Achievements' for an overview of the achievements. Risen does have classic Steam Trading Cards.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I want to describe this game with one word ''exploration''.   You cant find the feeling of exploration in recent rpgs.In Risen, you want  to find secret doors,loots etc.You want to explore the whole world, instead of just  following the quest markers.Lots of side quests with great writing and they are all fun to complete.The most poor side of the game is combat system but once you get used to it, you will see its not that bad, actually its fun.If you love RPGs with great story and atmosphere,this game is definetly for you.It deserves the full price but you can get the Risen series as bundle when its on sale.Try this underrated amazing game you wont regret it.

												Coming from a guy that never played the Gothic series, this game is awesome, once you get over the steep difficulty curve. This is really what RPGs are all about, making choices and customizing your character. What really sucked me in was the way one could play both sides, up to a point. Your choices matter, some paths open and other close depending on your choices, which i think is really cool. Many RPGs nowadays either allow you to get everything and be everything or just pingeonhole you in one role/class. Not Risen. You can walk your own path, a grey area, play both sides or stick to a single one, it's your choice, and that choice matters. I recommend it wholeheartily.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Steam Risen.exe is not compatible with 4GB patch as it trips Steams Large Address Aware flag. If you plan to mod and want to use more than 1.2GB of RAM on this game then do not buy the Steam version. If you still want to use the Steam version as it is on Sale, be aware you will not be using texture mods with high settings and ini increased draw distances without crashing due to lack of RAM due to how the game is coded regardless if you have a 64 bit Windows.Steam's Risen is already patched to 1.10, instead of fan patch get Radical Rebalancing Mod which has a modified version of the 1.3 fan patch already in it. Then get Risen - ModStarter 1.3.4.0 (Online DB version), this modding tool has all of the patches other than Radical Rebalancing. Avoid adding any general rebalancing mods except the A.R.B.M. mods that is designed to work with Radical Rebalance, as the rest will cause the game to crash due to conflict. Add in only 1 of the 2 music mods. If you using Steam you probably want to use Vurts DarkRisen texture Pack or possibly (not sure on the texture size) Autumn in Risen and not the high resolution option and this means you do not need the Grass Mod. Pick any other mods you want that will not cause conflict and have fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gothic 1 reboot1) Instead being inprisoned in a giant forcefield, you are inprisoned in a cursed island.2) Old camp is a Harbour town, new camp is a Bandit camp, sect camp is a monastery.3) Sadly characters like Diego, Xardas, Lester... do not exist but some new cool characters take they place.New CombatThe new combat looks intersting but it is imperfect, for example parry is way to slow to be useful, dodging sidesteps do not give you any invincibility frame so i end up using only backstep, sword swing not always hit that it touch, lock target is non existant, and many other elements make the combat kinda messy but i still prefer it from the old combat system.Complains1)  most characters have the same face2) repetitive go to each dungeon get item quests.3) cheap death traps.4) gothic 1-2 had better armor designStuff i loved1) detailed openworld, every single corner hides a tresure, no barren areas2) no loading to enter a house3) every npc has voice acting4) some Platforming5) cooking, smithing, alchemy, magic scroll making, lockpicking, pickpocket6) spells like telekinesis,  levitation, morph.

												Expect the same type of gameplay that you would experience in the 'Gothic' series.  Very old-school quick saving and loading due to cheap deaths style if that's your jam.  True to the aforementioned series with cooking elements, weaponsmithing, different storyline paths, etc.  Humourous dialogue at times with pipe smoking and booze drinking as well.  Stay away if you don't like a 90's-era action RPG feel but if you do, you'll find an enjoyable experience here.  I shouldn't neglect to mention that the soundtrack is pretty solid as well.

												Risen...!Everyone is talking about many big rpg's like Skyrim, Witcher, dark souls etc, but i haven't played those games(nor do gothic games) coz i don't have a good gaming pc. So I looked for some low spec requiring open world rpg games and i came across Risen(which is also very cheap btw). Within a few minutes into the game I realized that it's something else. waking  on the Faranga Island's shore as a washed away survivor at night with dead people around you set the adventure. It was accompanied by great music. gritty atmosphere. good gameplay. likeable characters. well written dialogues  and above all, wih an intresting story.the way they created the island was astonishing. how beautiful it was. variying terrain from swampy bandit's camp to harbor town to old hill temple, caves, waterfalls, ruins... it's unforgettable. And those animals and creatures... fighting each spices is a different experience. you have to apply different tactics for each one. overall Exploring the Island is the best part of the game for me next to story. Everyone is complaining about the combat but it's not a big deal according to me(btw i choose the bandit path which is full of meele combat) once you learn the combat and timed properly its just like dance. you will do it unconsciously. it will flow freely (but it's slightly hard to master at first )choosing different sides and the story unfolds according to that is clever. there are many more things that are good about this game that i can't write all in this review. But, there are certain things that i feel slightly uncomfortable toothe main thing i disliked is the graphics. don took it wrong. the ""graphics"" is beautiful for its time. but the graphics i'm talking about is that it looks gritty something like a gritty filter is applied over the screen and it puts a lot of strain on the eyes, especally during night(and half of the game you play in night). i  don't know how else to describe it. i have to strain very hard especially in caves and grass areas to find items. i don't know anyothers feel that way but its the major complain i havethe next thing is the final boss battle is slightly dissappointing. i expected more. and one more thing if i have to say is the island feels empty apart from the bandit camp and harbour town, and even those places also feel small. VeridictI'll surely recommed this game to anyone whose likes some openworld fantasy rpg games ✌			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I only got this game because the series was on sale, and I have been adicted to it. It's a fun, adventerous, and indeering game! Risen is an open world, where you can do whatever you want, whenever. Of course, you can get stuck in some places, as if you do quests in a wrong order, you cannot do any quests afterwards that branch off of it. This can be aggrivating when you go to the Don's camp and you end up breaking up the fighting ring before you can intimidate the brute, which allows you to see the Don. Personally, this is a game I absolutely love, and the kind of game I play often. The world, upon first playing, is very difficult. In all actuality, playing the game itself demands immideate skill and attention, and singling out enemies, which makes the game hard to begin with. But, once you get a sword and a shield (As your sword block can only defend enemies your height), you're ready to take on the world. While different areas have different monsters, they are always the same difficulty. While a young stingrat is weaker than a normal stingrat, the difficulty of the monsters is always the same. So, that is always boring. Another thing that makes the game a bit dull is the lack of emotion in the voice acting. While other characters have maybe some emotion at given times, and each character has a unique, different voice, all are lacking emotion. Your character, who is nameless the entire game, is the worse. He is compeltley monotone and normally the only emotion he sometimes shows is in the words, not the way they are said. The graphics are fantastic, given the time the game came out, and the story is very much up to you. From the beginning, you do a quick tutorial (That you can die on and not respan from) and your first option is to compeltley ditch the ♥♥♥♥♥ that comes with you or cook up meat for her needy♥♥♥♥♥ Hell, she is someone I think you could kill, but I never tried. The game can suggest some paths to you through characters, but it all depends on you. If you want to go play in the swamp, play in the swamp. If you want to kill everyone, kill everyone. The game might suggest some paths and ideas, but honestly, it's freedom in a game.This game, if I had to compare it to anything, is much like being born and then thrown into a thunderstorm over the ocean. You're likely gonna drown from everything thrown at you, but you can swim wherever while you struggle to learn the doggy paddle. Of course, once you figure out the basic type of swimming, you develop skill and tequnique to swimming and you make it farther and farther until swimming is second nature.At least, that's my stance.

												Firstly I am going to say this is a decent game as I bought it cheap and ended up playing it for 80+ hours - to completion.Apparently Risen was created by these guys who also made Gothic 1 and 2 - some sort of great RPG games of history.The game is a third person adventure where you play the role of sarcastic stowaway who is shipwrecked on an exotic island in a world where the gods have left and now suffers from the Titans that were subsequently unleashed, creating havoc and destruction.The graphics and sound are quite good and the island feel is spot on. We have beaches, waterfalls, night and day, thunder and lightning etc. The way you interact with the environment is pretty easy and well thought out, left click to engage, right click to block and middle click to engage combat.Your inventory is infinite and therefore unrealistic. However, this means you don't have to worry about petty management but immerse yourself in the gameplay. Although many times I found myself carrying 50 swords and 4 shields! In your travels you can pick herbs as you would have in Oblivion and Skyrim. You can also harvest bits of dead animals that you kill. The system that allows you to create potions and spells from these activities is pretty basic but invaluable later on in the game.I played the game in normal difficulty all the way through and I have to talk about the combat. It is brutal. Basically you are ship wrecked nobody and the island is home to dangerous wild animals like wolves, boars and undead creatures who will EAT YOU FOR BREAKFAST in no time. BE WARNED. This is the first game, ever, that I had to save after every combat, and even in mid combat. The combat is challenging and requires you to block a lot and look for openings. It requires you to carefully watch what your enemy does to see if there is a pattern in their behaviour and find an optimum time to advance and strike. Often I had to back track or run to a single pathway or ledge so that my opponents could not gang up on me. Many opponents will circle you and attack from behind or the side. You will appreciate how it feels to be hunted. As your character grows and becomes more powerful, this does not change!The game looks and feels a bit like my beloved Oblivion, however it suffers in comparison. The game world is smaller and with only two factions, there is less interaction with people. The limited XP available forces you to choose fighter or mage, although you can choose to go 'Paladin' and make and use your own magic scrolls. The end game story involving a volcano and titan battle seems trivial compared to the mighty end game battle in Oblivion. Saying all that, I really did enjoy exploring the island and progressing through the story. The combat really made me mad on many occasions and my failure in that partly explains my need to complete the game. I really did enjoy those occasions where to progress the storyline I had to transform into a little snail or use levitation or telekinesis. However, these opportunities were quite rare and the game would have benefited with more of that stuff.Unlike another game I tried to play recently (cough - The Witcher), the designers of this game really did a great job matching the potential game quests with open play. Many times I travelled around and did stuff in my own personal random order and the game mostly was able to make sense of all that and update the game world in accordance. That was quite impressive. For example, I did not speak to this creepy looking guy in the Bandit Camp but explored the whole area quite extensively. When I finally spoke to Mr Creeps my conversation options were amended to reflect quests I had already completed.Good little game, recommended to those who would like to visit a pacific island like Hawaii and have patience for the combat. Remember to save often though!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Here's my two centsThis game brought back some memories of old-school RPG in the sense that it is not straightforward. You have to learn its peculiarities, such as the combat and skill system. You are given options, choices, and sometimes when you realize the full consequences of such decisions, its too late to go back. Some of the quests are simple enough, while others require you to think on what your next move should be.If you are someone looking for a simple, easy, standard RPG like the hundreds of them popping up all the time, this probably isn't a game for you. If you want to try out an RPG with a flavour of its own (granted you will always find similarities to other games, if you are an old fan of RPG), then maybe you should consider trying this game out.Now, I bought this game for 1.00€. For a similar price, its really a great deal. But if you plan on spending the full 10€ (current steam price), then beware the game has some glitches and bugs, probably because of the port to Steam.

												Absolutely worth recommendation! Great game exactly what i was looking for! Wanted to play good RPG with interesting story and world that's living their own live. I got bored by doing the same quest in Gothic 2 all the time. So looked for another game to play and noticed I have a Risen in my library, so downloaded it. And the first moments totaly got me in! Storm, beach and danger wow! Really love the mood! Story wasn't really clear to me until i have spend some time in one of the camps. Played almost 10hrs in 3 days and can't stop! Graphic improved so much since Gothic 2, the forests feel really full of bushes and trees, easy to get lost. The world feels really real! Great job Piranha!If you have ever loved Gothic, you need to play this!Great game for me 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Risen is the best game from this developer up to date. Long story short, it's Gothic 2 rules set of gameplay shoveled down new texture pack without the game breaking bugs and shortcomings Gothic 2 suffered at some places. I remember being quite disappointed in this game first time it came out (2009) because of it. I was sure that the studio that made this game was far more better and ambitious and it would try to deliver a completely new experience, but what was I thinking back then? They've tried do that in Risen 2 and failed miserably in everything they've done. I guess some people have to stick the only thing they can do properly - in this case keep doing Gothic game over and over again, because any attempt of doing anything else results in a spectacular failure only buyer's regret and mind zombies are willing do defend.The whole concept is a parody of Gothic's lore. Once again we're some nameless hero who lands in the hostile, isolated from the rest of the world area (we even have a magical barrier), who tries to sort his place in the new environment and eventually is involved into saving the world. In order to achieve that he has to ally himself with one of three guilds: a revolted group of greedy clique (Don), a devoted military order (Inquisition) or mages (duh) - the exact equivalent of Gothic 2 guilds: Onar, Paladins and mages (duh). During our journey we will encounter a set of characters who're renamed Gothic serie's people. Like, Mendoza is Cor Kalom, Eldric reminds Saturas, etc. Even a plot reminds Gothic 1's plot. Mid-game it comes out that something everyone praised and considered the only hope of survival is actually the biggest threat around (Titan being Sleeper). Of course there are some new themes, the biggest being the lizardmen race, which was very promising - but it was dumped later on. The whole lore and plot of Risen was dumped for the sake of making some kind of comedy Risen 2 (and 3) came out to be, based loosely (very, very loosely) on sub-plot of Patty's quest, since nothing adds up between this and later titles. They even forgot that in Risen 1 it's said that a mage banished the gods, not that they abandoned the human race (like it's said in Risen 3). And that's the second theme that could make an awesome sequel, the actual banishment of the gods.And all Risen recycled worked out well, since the world and art design is coherent and falls in memory. The graphics (although not top notch and characters' looks are dreadful at first), lighting music, ambient sounds are very good and have some kind of charm (now, compare it tho the pirates of the caribbean bs).The gameplay, combat system and character development are top notch and everything Gothic 2 aimed for. It's balanced, the feeling of progressing is there. In the beginning you will fastly learn to stay away from some monsters and areas, just to struggle with them mid-game when necessary to maul them down in the end-game. After beating an ashbeast with few hits of magic missiles you feel the progress you've made, which is absolutely absent in Risen 2 and 3 (where you maul everything the game has to offer in the first few hours of the game and nothing new is delivered later on, making the presence of character development system abysmal and pointless at all).The quests are mostly fetch'n'kill alike, but there are some exceptions. The investigation quest at the volcano keep is actually the best quest PB ever made (and which is clearly based on an investigation quest in Gothic 2). It's nothing special or sophisticated of course, it's still the game about slashing things and making the numbers in a window to go higher and higher, but the overall experience is very, very good. Too bad it was ruined,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and abused with sequels.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First I must state that I played Risen 2 before this game because, well, pirates. But since I enjoyed the second so much, I had to play the first one to see the history of Nameless Hero.I'll keep this as short as I can and to the point.Great and challenging game. I thoroughly enjoyed it, even though there were times I was ungodly frustrated with the situation I found myself in. Saving and saving often is, once again, your best friend in the Risen games. If I had not have saved before every major event or even during fights (defeat one enemy, save, defeat the next, etc) I might have given up (at least for a period of time) about halfway through. Some of the mobs that arrive later in the game are extremely challenging at first, which doesn't make it easier to stomach. But you just gotta chug on through.I'd also suggest using a guide for this game, even if just for quick reference and to not play by strictly. Risen 2 was fairly in depth, but this one has quite a few more puzzles and mazes to figure out. With the addition of magic it is much more creative. Once you get into temple exploring I found guides to be a God send in a certain few.Though my experience with RPGs is limited, I would say that this one is definitely up there in the ""Great Game"" category. It was challenging, fun, interesting and had a good plot. The character development was pretty good as well. Depending on which path you take, you can become a rune caster. But no matter what you will have spells (if you so choose and I highly suggest it) thanks to scrolls. You can brew potions that help increase stats later in the game as well.One thing I appreciated about this game was that they provided a decent amount of mobs to help you level up as you got closer to the Chapter's ends and end of game. This made you have a little more faith in yourself when it came to boss fights.There are many more weapons in this game to be had, though nothing that makes you have a dilemma on which one to choose of the -same style-. You have a few weapon groups to choose from, I went with axe and sword, preferring them to staffs and the ability to use a shield makes a huge difference when exploring. Armor is one set - there are no individual pieces. There is the whole outfit and then the helmet (amulets and rings seperate as well). The armor is pretty static as your upgrades progress with the storyline. Since I went with Inquisition Warrior of the Order, I am not sure how it turns out with Bandit or Mage but I doubt it is much different by way of stats.Risen 2 is still my favorite because it seemed to suit my more ""casual"" play style, but this first one was great in its own right and I don't regret my 52.9 hours devoted to it. I would definitely recommend it to those looking for a challenging game that actually takes thought and time to beat instead of a 10 hour quickie.Now on to Risen 3!P.S. My poor friends were flooded with screenshots from this game as well (sorry, not sorry!). Love the world appearance and atmosphere the teams of Risen created.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm about 30 hours into the game and have really enjoyed it.  It gives good freedom and you really have to pick your battles early in the game.  Combat takes practice but it's rewarding when you win.  Save a lot as it says because a few bad steps and your dead.  It's pretty easy to die. All and all I come back over and over to this game.  It's good and I highly recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Risen is one of the best games with awful combat I've ever played. I found a lot of interest in the moral ambiguity of most major characters. It seems as though whichever side I joined, I would grow to respect and resent the faction leaders and their choices for various reasons. Minor characters were also intersting, with a lot of the side quests tying into each other, I got a real sense of community. The whole world that the game takes place in is very well fleshed out and immersive. Exploring was always fun and rewarding (until you actually had to fight) with treasures and side quests hidden all about. I'd definitely recommend this game if you have the patience to deal with bad (although not game breakingly ♥♥♥♥♥♥) combat. The characters, the world, and the story are well worth it!

												I enjoyed this game a lot. The background lore is just ok but the game world itself is very alive. It is a small to medium open world but it is dense and all of the npcs feel like real characters in a story. There is no filler or wasted space.Combat in Risen is relatively challenging, but IMO some people hype the difficulty too much... don't let that turn you off if you're not a super hardcore gamer or whatever. On the normal setting it really isn't that hard; it is just tough enough to require some strategy and timing, and to make it feel well-earned when you eventually become very powerful later on.The game has an immersive atmosphere. It's not always super polished but the graphics are definitely nice (very different than the xbox 360 version) and the way it handles the world's lush vegetation is especially impressive. I have an older laptop and this game ran well- it seems to have the best graphics/performance ratio of any I've played on here.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Risen is an open-world RPG set in a land filled with turmoil. You play as a nameless castaway, stranded on an island with not a coin to your name. So, you make a name for yourself - getting swept up in the struggles of the people while you do so.StoryThe story in Risen is interesting, sure. But I cannot say it was anything too phenomenal. The overarching plot (and main goal) failed to keep me interested, and I found myself more focused on the smaller quests and the lives of the individual characters.GraphicsThe graphics in this game have held up surprisingly well over time. While they are not as impressive as a new game, they were certainly not jarring. There were some beautiful scenes, and never a moment where I noticed just how old the game was.CombatCombat... it feels like it had so much potential. I love being able to parry attacks, having to predict my opponent’s patters. Not so much when I am fighting three at once, though. I feel like the combat could have been much more entertaining if you only had one foe to face at a time.Why I hated itThe final boss fight. ARGH! How frustrating it was, that even with a quicksave, I lost all my progress on the boss due to a misstep and fall. Final RecommendationThis is really not a bad game. Nothing phenomenal, and certainly not something I would pick up again just to revisit the game world. But it was fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Risen. Ahhh how I missed this game. The funky characters, terrible graphics and stereotypical old RPG art for the menus and sounds. This game really is my♥♥♥♥♥♥ and I don't regret rebuying for the PC. I had it once on the consoles but....it had a terrible console port.The console version was fun, don't get me wrong! However the game is way more fitting on PC than if you were to get this for Xbox and/or PlayStation. The company generally likes to make their games difficult at start, climbing into easy as you learn the ropes and understand how your foes move, how to be aware, along with some really fun puzzles here and there with old-styled RPG elements, cooky characters that are memorable and will stroke your nostalgia bone, all while still being high quality to those who appreciate it. The game is now only 10$, which I'd say it's worth at least 15$-20$ at the most. It's practically a steal now. The game is long, has many paths, many decisions to overtake, many ways to move about with your tactics, many ways to build your nameless hero--- The game is a blast. Now here's the cons so you know what you're in for, because it's obviously not 100% peachy. The tutorial could be vague to some, requiring some to search the web or ask in forums about tactics and a better understanding of the somewhat clunky combat system in place within the game's world. Sometimes if you do certain unscripted acts such as reading a stone tablet or talking to an NPC too fast after skipping through something not relating to a quest you can cause the game to overload and crash. Though these are rare, I still advise being careful when spamming items that are unscripted/based on a weird RNG such as the tablets (sometimes they give +3 wisdom and sometimes they give +4.) and my final complaint is the final boss was way too easy and honestly lacked much of a climax.    To be vague and not spoil, it's a simple dodge and deflect shots back at the enemy. Some dancing around so you don't fall down a hole. Other than that, the story was very intruiging, characters were unique and some quirky, and I really enjoyed the combat and the ways you could go about it.                                       I'd give a safe 8.5/10.                       It was a fun experience and I felt my money was well spent. EDIT: I completed the story in about 20 hours, and I didn't even do everything yet. The game has some awesome replayability, so when I play again I plan to go straight up warrior class instead of mage like I did on my first playthrough. The game, if you focus purely on the campaign and nothing else, can be completed within 10 hours. The game isn't even that big and it is cheap, though it gives you plenty to do. If you were to do everything, I'd say it's as much as 30+ hours.It's 10$. Doesn't take that much space. It has a long and interesting campaign with a kind of floppy however interesting story. An even longer playthrough if you try to do even 2/4ths of what the game has to offer. Fun, challenging and in certain ways rivaling other rogue-likes for lip biting difficulty, however still being fair to the player. I don't see a problem, and if you're masochistic, you'll like going on the more harder difficulties.You could go through the entire game with pure stats and no skill investments....and you'd still have a chance to beat it. It doesn't force you to do ANYTHING.P.S. I haven't once ran into that climbing bug everyone says is frequent. Not on console and not on PC. I guess they patched it before I got the game.

												The year is 2014, and the game was released in 2009, this is my first game from the team that made Gothica. Here goes my review.At first I thought this game was bad it was overly difficult, anything could kill me, anyone i talked to wanted to ♥♥♥♥ me over and/or kill/rob/swindle/convert/enslave me. After some constructive help on forums, I am so freaking glad I followed through on this game, despite the fact I need break mainly because I havent slept in 2 days because of it.First Graphics, 8.5/10 modern   10/10 back in the day for realism .well you MUST play these graphics maxed out, it's gorgeous. During the day the world is stunning, better then vanilla oir vanilla HD pack skyrim easily. grass physics, water movement,stormy weather physics all wonderful. it really sucks you in, and at night, the fog off the swamps and fields, shadows in dark caves, enemies moving just outside of of a realistic torch range. Shadow casting has saved my butt twice from ambushes, and i ean they were real shadows, like you would expect in real life.Sounds, 7/10 world feels alive, you have to play for hours and hours to realize some of the noises are recycled, but noise becomes as important in combat as is seeing the enemy, you know when they may pounce or are falsely playing dead to bait you into a pack ambush.Combat difficulty 9/10  it's not darksouls hard but it's rough. Don't think you are teh dragon born and can suddenly pick up an axe and drop 4 bandits at level 1, see that porcupine, while at the very start of the game you are ♥♥♥♥ed in the♥♥♥♥♥ get to lvl 8 grab some armor, training and PRACTICE PARRY/BLOCK and he won't be such a♥♥♥♥♥♥ Think a lizard man is easy to drop? Well if you let him get close you'll drop you in a hit, 2 if you're lucky, and while you are watching him you neve saw his buddy SNEAK around you and smash your♥♥♥♥♥♥up. you have to LEARN to fight, learn to engage, do damage at range and switch fighting stances/weapons and styles as they close in. Think you're an all poweful mage dropping an Ash Beast?

												When the main serie had gone wild and we've got Arcania and other♥♥♥♥♥♥ Risen looks and feels like a true sequel. It's not perfect, but pretty good. The first half of the game is awesome, the best. Like in Gothic we have huge open world. There are no limitations on what to do and when. It's fully player's choice. Such an freedom is attractive and you miss many of game's flaws like bad difficulty balance, too simple trading and RPG part. Even the fighting system isn't that good. It's very nominal. These very flaws frustrate you near the end. The last chapter and final boss are awfully bad. And the story is very linear. Overall, good graphics and optimization, cool sound and minor number of bugs. 8/10--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Неофициальное продолжение хорошо всем известной серии. Получилось не то, чтобы идеально, но хорошо. Первая половина игры - лучшее, что вообще в ней есть. Как и в Готике у нас огромный мир, делай, что душе угодно, никаких ограничений. Убил сюжетного персонажа - твои проблемы. Такая свобода подкупает. Не замечаешь даже завышенную сложность в первые 10 часов игры. В мир Ризен погружаешься настолько, что не замечаешь главных проблем. В отлични от последней тру-готики, тут многое упрощено: боевка, торговля, возможности взаимодействия и прокачка. Все это, как ни печально, всплывает к концу игры. 4-я глава и конец - худшее, что есть в Ризен. Если без спойлеров, то игра становится слишком линейной и это е губит.В остальном, приятная графика и звук, неплохая оптимизация и малое кол-во глюков. 8/10 ",242,30,1,17,7,0,14

												After finishing Skyrim I did not want to play through it again and waste another a hundred hours of my time in this complex sandbox game. However, I was still addicted to its sandbox formula and the kind of freedom it offered. So I began my quest to seek something that could cure my itch. I came across the Gothic and Risen series and read up on its development history so I purchased both to see if they would satisfy my itch. Being a huge Skyrim fan, I will be making many comparisons between the two games within this review. You have been warned.Plot: 3/5Personally, I enjoy playing games that have a deep, well woven plot. I understand open ended gameplay is a big thing right now (e.g. Dayz, Minecraft), but for me I find that after playing these games for a period of time, they begin to feel mechanical and repetitive. The plot in Risen can't be considered superb, but it does its job to keep me engegd the whole time. The player character possesses a very bland personality and his voice acting is also very stiff. In my opinion, I would rather prefer to not have the player character be given an identity or voice at all. A good RPG should be immersive. So much so that the player should feel like they are exploring a whole new world and their actions are going to have an impact on this world. Without this immersion, the game becomes a grind just like those free to play mmorpgs. Elements like drugs and prostitution are also sort of lame. They aren't outrageously over the top like the way The Witcher does it and they aren't exactly sensual and emotional like Mass Effect or Dragon Age. However, I really liked the way factions were implemented in this game. It was very hard for me to decide which factions to join at the start of the game because I couldn't tell who were the good guys or bad guys.Gameplay mechanics: 2.5/5This is the part of the game that really didn't sit well with me. First of all, I hated Risen's map system. I understand that for authenticity sake the player must first seek out an expert to draw a map before it becomes available for use, but even then, the map was confusing to use and I probably spent half of my time in this game running around and unable to find my way. The quest prompts were also too vague and I find the inclusion of the conversations with the quest giver to be utterly pointless. The varieties of creatures to fight in this game were also abysmal. Once the Lizardmen made their appearance encounters with other enemies became greatly reduced. To be fair the gameplay mechanics isn't all bad. I really liked some of the skills in this game. For example, I had a blast floating around with the levitation spell, and the in game traps were also well designed too.Music: 2.5/5I may not be an music expert, but Skyrim's Dragonborn theme song and the female vocals that play during Dragonage's menu screen still resonates in my head from time to time. Risen lacks the sort of musical score which can make a memorable impact on its players but they are still nice to listen to. I do like some of the music that plays during battles or in the background as I explored the wilderness. For example, as I was exploring a dark ruin, the creepy ambient sound and loud shrieks really put a chill down my spine.Graphics: 4/5Depending on your systems, this game can be very pretty. The lighting and reflections were gorgeous and I took a lot of screenshots of the beautiful scenery. Final Score: 3/5 A good game, but only if you got it as part of a deal.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Skyrim通关以后不愿意再打开算是一种精神洁癖，认为游戏玩通关了就应该放下了， 繁复去玩让人头疼。但是对于sandbox游戏的热爱让我又开始寻找上古的替代品， 于是知道了gothic和risen系列， 只购买了piranha – bytes工作室制作的那几部。既然玩了，难免要和上古做个比较。 故事情节：3/5 之所以把故事放在最前面讲，是因为我是比较看重这个部分的。有一些游戏貌似很自由很开放，你在这个世界什么都可以做，例如最近热门的那些僵尸类游戏，但是玩久了你就会觉得有种机械工的感觉， 不停重复去做一件事情，乏味的很。而risen在故事设计上只能算是刚刚好，首先主角的性格就不那么明晰，配音也很僵硬，不如没有配音。 其余的配角的性格反超主角，这也是为什么大家都很喜欢patty而嫌弃男主，就是这样的原因。 一个好的rpg，要让玩家真正完全带入到角色中去，让自己感觉这个屏幕里奔跑的小人就是我自己，而不是一个杀怪的苦力。游戏中的抽大麻和妓女的设定觉得很无聊， 根本就是打擦边球，还不如直接干到巫师的级别，很黄很暴力， 要么就学学质量效应和龙纪元，玩玩暧昧。但是值得肯定， 游戏里游戏的阵营设定确实不错，这也是加分的一点，一开始确实让人不知所措，我该相信谁的话总是萦绕在脑中。最后犯贱的看了攻略才算石头落地。游戏设定：2.5/5为什么给了这么低的分数， 也许这样的系统设定真的不太适合我。。。首先习惯了上古那种地图以后这个游戏完全是生命在吐槽的感觉。。。我倒不反对地图为了逼真要真的去请人画地图，或者从一些探险者身上去扒取，我无法忍受的是地图给了就和没给一样，有些时候时间根本没有浪费在剧情上， 完全是浪费在迷路上了， 任务写的不明不白也就算了，你把一些有的没的对话写在上面是闹哪样啊！ 强烈不建议没玩过此类rpg的同学玩这个游戏，会十分不适应。。。要时刻记住，做好一个rpg游戏应尽的本分，不要弄弄就变成生存游戏了哦，玩家会闹情绪的说。而且怪物的种类真的少到要大姨妈都不想来了， 后面蜥蜴人一出来其他怪物数量大减啊，蜥蜴人是在刷存在么， 根本就是偷懒好么！ 但是一些技能真的很好玩，那个悬浮技能啊，飘来飘去的， 还有各种机关陷阱。。。音乐： 2.5/5好的音乐是什么。。。就是skyrim一打开那两句：dovakin dovakin，或者龙纪元一开始那个哼哼唧唧老娘们的吟唱， 一辈子都忘不掉。。。你问我risen是什么开头音乐。。。昨晚刚玩呢都不记得了我打开再听听。。。。 一些环境和战斗的音乐还是比较好的，特别是进第一个ruin的时候那个鬼叫给我吓毁了。。。画面：4/5在那个年代应该算不错的了吧。。。还是截了一些比较美丽的图片。。。总体3/5， 百分制就60分。。。艾玛。。。尊低。。。			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""The Real Gothic 4"", because why not? This game can be talked for hours, yet I will keep it precise. I have spent more hours than recorded on steam, as I played the game on its release date and bought it on physical copy. This game is worth every cent and even more. I recommend it highly to anyone looking for a free world adventure with quest lines and with amazing combat engine. I am in love with this game and you will be too. The best thing is that if you played Gothic before, and specifically Gothic 3 Forsaken Gods, you will find a totally different story here, but same health and mana bars, similar items, gathering and fighting, because it's identical engine and this is the true Gothic 4.Buy it! It's worth it - you won't regret!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Risen is a game that just simply grows on you. It starts out as a simple something and infects you like some kind of benign, beautiful infection.It's the story.It's combat is simple, yet effective. It's skillset is just the right balance of simplicity and growth. It's not linear, and yet, it uses the difficulty of the environment to keep you from moving beyond where the story wants you to go. It's open world and yet your skillset and loadout will keep you where the story wants you.The mobs you encounter don't level up with you, giving you the satisfaction of whipping the siht out of a mob today that you had trouble with a while back. Each time you get smacked you can confidently nurse your wounds and walk away muttering, ""I'll be back you bsatrad!"" And you will be back... and you'll be back ready to utterly destroy them. Sweet satisfaction. You can ONLY get this kind of revenge in a video game. That said, save often! Get very familiar with the ""Quick Save"" button.And the story moves on. It took me well into the 3rd chapter before I had to search online to understand how to do something.The acting is great for a video game... and unexexpected for it's age.I have, at the time of this writing, just 54 hours in the game... and just as I was thinking it's about to wrap up the story, it continues. Fantastic! The quality has caused me to search out a whole series of games I didn't know existed.As for ""cons"" I would mention the graphics... but that wouldn't be fair as I'm sure they were revolutionary for the time it was created. And they're actually beautiful with the way it does its blurring affect on things that aren't supposed to be in focus and other scenery. It's simply outstanding. It's the edges and corners that give its age away. Other than the occasional glitches that occur when you get jammed up against a wall and can see the scenery behind it suddenly, I haven't found any bugs.In short, it's well thought out, a story that is well written, a program thoroughly baked and bug free, combat and experience growth well balanced and satisfaction in just the right places.If you're into dungeons and RPG and over the shoulder combat, you'll enjoy it.

												Do I like the game? Yes!Do I RECOMMEND this game? YES!Sometimes when buying old games you take into factor, how well made is the game? can I still appreciate the graphics?Is this gonna entertain me for a good amount of time? how's the gameplay?Well based on my opinion, I can answer all those questions with yes. 1 this is an open world game with good amount of choices for you to go through and live in the game (how you  get or choose a class is an example of how your choice greatly affects your character). Graphics may be a bit outdated (especially on female NPC's) but isn't that far to what we have today. Things to do and dungeons are all in a good amount to keep you entertained.I've clocked about 70 hours into playing this game, and gameplay is sweet. fighting is awesome and the use of blocking is really needed (I find this ""rare"", and a good experience). CONS:Funniest thing is the awkward jumping. (walking, running and fighting are good)Fast travel is fairly late in the game.The whole map is kinda small but just enough? (especially your gonna walk a lot)Occasionaly NPC can be out of place. (I've only experienced this like 3x at most, the most memorable is when i found phil near the volcano ruins and had to save him from dying.)No character creation (you're basically stuck with the nameless hero guy from the get go.)But hey! Lore is good, there's a dash of politics, moral choices, getting into trouble for accidentaly hitting someone, accidentaly killing an npc (that might be a quest holder), betrayal. etc. ^_^			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game, especially if you are a fan of Gothic series. Combat system in this game is good, it's fun to fight, but it takes a bit of practice to learn fight well. Enviroment and monsters look pretty good for 6 year old game and it's really fun to explore the map. Story is pretty good too. Personally one of my favorite RPGs (after Gothic 1 and 2).

												This is a game I'd recommend if you're into classic Gothic series(yes, I meant first 2). Because personally I'm having a hard time finding a fantasy-RPG in similiar quality. I once finished this(not in steam) and going for the second nowadays. The world has multiple factions with their own lores and small worlds to interact with so it makes it a lot more replayable. So  only beginning&ending are the same.It's not a game where it hands you everything you need, It delivers that good old feeling of starting from the bottom and earning everyone's respect, choosing sides etc. I really dig the combat system in this game, it feels rewarding to kill someone because you have to use your reflexes rather than smashing buttons. Enjoyable quests and dialogs, really good world design and balance.A masterpiece.9/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Risen is a good role-playing experience, it is just fun to investigate every corner of the mysterious island. The story and quests are quite varied and the game world gives you an credible feeling of being a part of it.  The controls are simple and graphics are quite nice. Some of the combat mechanics can become tiresome and the game still has bugs, remember to save often. The unoffical patch fixes many bugs but still, it's still possible to get stuck where you have no choice but to reload a save game. Overall, the game is not a bad experience. A fun RPG that will give you hours of fun with only some minor bumps.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Risen is a lot like Piranha Bytes' previous games: the Gothic series (1-3 anyway, ArcaniA and Forsaken Gods weren't their doing). It's a hardcore action-RPG with a pretty unforgiving level of difficulty, a good amount of risk vs reward scenarios, and a pretty large, open world to explore. It also has one of the better combat systems that I've seen within its genre. Well worth taking a look at, especially if you're a fan o the Gothic series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												 An old RPG, but stands the test of time. The main issue is that all enemies have the same reaction time, so killing a rat requires the same skill as killing an undead lord; the differenc is that you can take a lot of hits from the rat and kill it in one blow and the undead lord will destroy you if it touches you and killing it takes a long time. DIfferent enemies have different attacks, though. The story is decent, it works, though not incredibly original. Overall, the game is fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In my opinion most should ONLY play this game if they've already finished multiple playthroughs of TES 3, 4 & 5. If the fantasy setting and roleplaying are what you're looking for, add Witcher 1&2 and Dragon Age Origins to that list, and if open-world gameplay is what you're after, add Fallout 3 and NV.This game is one of the most solidly ""slightly below average"" games I've ever played. No aspect of this game is better than the equivalent mechanic/quality in Elder Scrolls Oblivion, and many aspects are worse than even Morrowind, a considerably older game. On top of that, there is plenty of plain old BAD DESIGN in the story, quests and levelling that shouldn't be excusable, but are unfortunatly trademarks of Piranha Bytes.STORY is sparse, forgettable and poorly told. While the setting is an interesting one, the story just isn't really there, the end villain seems added on at the last minute, and none of the characters are memorable, except maybe the player chacter.GRAPHICS are ok, around Oblivion quality but with much better lighting for the most part. A big issue, though is that there is no Gamma slider. The Devs, apparently wanted nighttime/caves to be REALLY REALLY DARK as some form of ""realism"", but this makes sections of the game unplayable if your computer isn't located in a very very dark room, unless you make use of torches/light spells, which in turn make gameplay even more clunky. BAD DESIGN CHOICE!SOUND - some better-than-average voice acting mixed with some really amateurish voice acting. Totally forgettable sound effects and music, compounded by a bug (fixable by fanpatches) that breaks music in-game due to some sloppy sound file editing by the devs. GAMEPLAY:COMBAT is quit punishing/unforgiving early on due to the BAD DESIGN CHOICE of making armor only upgradeable at the end of each chapter. Enemies don't respawn, and the game is ""Open World"", but if you try to explore in the first couple chapters when decent armor isn't available, you'll be killed in 1-4 hits from most enemies. The combat system seems ""deep"" when you first start playing, but in reality each enemy type follows a set pattern and once you figure that out and have some ok armor, they are universally easy and actually don't really possess any sort of AI.OPEN WORLD really is open and you can basically go everywhere on the island from the get go. I like the fact that enemies don't respawn, which helps in the exploration process. I pretty much explored the entire island in ""Chapter 2"" out of 4, which made Chapters 3&4 only a couple of hours long each. The world is relatively SMALL, and there are only 3 real ""types"" of environment besides dungeon/caves, so there isn't so much variety.CHOICE is poorly handled. The story is almost completely linear, and dialogue options aren't really options, as no branching conversations are possible, and you end up getting 100% of dialogue no matter what order you ask your questions. All conversations could in reality have been non-interactive cutscenes. WITHOUT A WALKTHROUGH IT'S ALMOST PURE CHANCE WHICH CLASS YOU'LL END UP AS, which is frustrating, and the only real choice in the game only affects a small part of the early plot. THIS CHOICE IS EASILY BROKEN if you do a few quests for both factions. In my playthrough, I did some of each factions' quests, and ended up members of ""both"" which broke certain aspects of the game and made parts of the game not make sense. Only after this started getting weird, when reading a walkthrough for the first time to try and figure out what went wrong did I find out that PIRANHA BYTES simply DID A HORRIBLE JOB PLANNING AND EXECUTING THE STORY STRUCTURE AND DESIGN. Judging from most internet forums on the matter, most people who didn't use a walkthrough got ♥♥♥♥ed in some way while playing the game.OTHER BAD DESIGN DECISIONS BY PIRANHA BYTES about in Risen. Stats can be boosted up to 100 by trainers, but well over 100 by potions. The game doesn't tell you this, though, so if you find and use the potions before training up to 100, you basically waste them. And if you have stat-affecting items on while training, you actually break the training process and LOWER how high you can train your stats. HORRIBLE DESIGN THAT WAS LEFT UNPATCHED BY A BAD DEVELOPER.THE ENDGAME IS A LAZY BOSS FIGHT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE REST OF THE GAME IN TERMS OF GAMEPLAY. It is followed by the games only pre-rendered cutscene followed by a black screen with a short voiceover, the credits and BANG - back to the main menu with no option to further explore the world.Anyways, I should mention that I inadvertantly left the game running for a little over a day in the background, so while my record says over 50 hours played, I actually finished the game in about 25 hours and did pretty much everything possible in a single playthrough.I enjoyed the first 10 hours or so in which I was exploring the island and not really advancing the main story, but after that, the horrible, sloppy design and gameplay elements began to manifest, and the last 10-15 hours were quite a grind. I honestly wish I'd just given up and had a 3rd playthrough of an Elder Scrolls game or the Witcher instead.Piranha Bytes should be ashamed that most of their games are broken/buggy and that they rely on fan patches and walkthroughs for players to be able to finish their games. I know they don't have Bethesda's kind of budget, but that isn't an excuse for releasing broken, mediocre games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After the somewhat abrupt and premature ending in Gothic 3 and the separation of Piranha Bytes from the publisher and the Gothic Franchise, fans welcomed the new game by Piranha Bytes, Risen. I was more than interested to see if the game was going to be a continuation of the Gothic series and whether it could capture the atmosphere of the world of Gothic. I would classify this under two headings. With respect to the continuation of the story, there was not much and there wasn't much they could do about it probably, what with the copyright issues and all. They did however use the same theme of what was left of the world after the events in Gothic 3 (won't mention them here to avoid spoilers).As for gameplay, I was not disappointed though I did feel that there were several areas they could have improved. Firstly, the world is not open; it is quite small and limited, even compared to RPGs at around the same time. Secondly, the gameplay is similar to that of Gothic 3, which brings the advantage of commonality for Gothic players but has a Learning Curve for new players (people who bought Risen and never played the Gothic titles). Thirdly, the magic combat/use is lacking; you can only have one active spell effect at a time. For example, (you cannot have boost armor and boost strength at the same time). So far as the story goes, I can say that Piranha did a good job and the Gothic fans should not be disappointed; at least I wasn't but of course that's just my opinion.I just felt the ending was a little too quick...

												A great game for old school RPG fans, even on easy this game will curbstomp you. Risen also doesn't hold your hand throughout the game, when solving a quest you do it based upon the details given to you rather than following a marker until you finished the task. So I recommend this game for people who want a challenge, the battles are fun and tense, each problem you face can be tackled in various ways, also the choices you make can have an effect on the world around you.

												It definitely has the Gothic DNA and a lot of the elements that made Gothic great are still here: a merc camp, a bustling town, and little pockets of ruins peppered throughout the wilderness. Exploring is still the main highlight of the game, here, however, the combat lacks the charm of the original series and follows a boring rhythm based combat system. Enemies will almost always block some of your attacks, which adds to the tedium since if you're beefing up a combat skill in particular it doesn't feel like your're a master swordsman at all. The game follows tradition and has a pretty grindy final act where you face TONS of enemies in armor, thankfully here it's easy to run past most enemies. All in all a solid title that doesn't retain all of what made Gothic great but has enough to warrant a playthrough, though I won't blame you for jumping ship before the final boss.Positive note: I do like how they add traversal tools, e.g. telekinesis, transformation, it enhances the exploration and is something I want to see in Elex! Hopefully they nail the feel of the skill AND item progression.Something that bothered me was that no matter how badass your armor is, every enemy will make you stagger if they connect w a hit, even a ♥♥♥♥ing pig, dog or squirrel. I remember getting good armor in Gothic and smiling as I saw the wolves and scavengers graze me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It would be hard to hard to argue with someone saying this game is kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥. It can be buggy, dated, and hackneyed at times. But if you're like me, and loved every second of the Gothic games, this game is a great update on the model. In fact, it's basically a remake of Gothic. This game/series has an open world exploration model unlike any other. For one thing, there is a finite amount of XP in the game. So grinding is impossible. That's ♥♥♥♥ing cool. Plus, you can wander virtually anywhere. The game doesn't really mind too much (i.e. it doesn't break) if you glitch your way into certain areas too early or whatever. What mostly keeps you out of places that you're not supposed to get to is that you'll get your♥♥♥♥♥beat. Monsters don't scale with level, and pretty much all of them are tougher than you at the outset. The actual role-playing isn't that deep (this game is the anti-bioware), but that doesn't mean that it's not fun to explore and immerse yourself in a new world. If you can put up with some flaws and imperfections, then this is a fun and unique (outside of Gothic) romp.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Finally, the RPG  I have been talking about: A place for everything, and everything in its place. Beautifully conceived and executed, where every last little plant you pick up has a clear benefit. Leveling up is tough, but you see the benefits and progression clearly. Tired of games where you pick up endless junk, stuffing your inventory, which only produces vague  overly detailed stats? How are you supposed to sift out 4 party members, each with 30-40 total item/magic stats? Leveling up becomes meaningless, you become a spectator. Developers who just stuff their games with endless junk and items with 10 stats each and say ""The player can develop their character any way they want"" need to play Risen. Combat is perfect, very tough, but fair. Again, when you level up your sword, you get a definite skill, you see the difference clearly.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you enjoy a classic RPG with exploring, crafting and slaying monsters while have a good story; this is your game.There's a big world to explore, a lot to learn, challenging monsters and a superb skill system. It has great voice acting, varied side quest and the atmosphere at some locations is absolutely stunning.Sure, there are minor problems and bugs (like in any other game too), as the climbing bug for example, but it's nothing game breaking, nothing that makes you wanna rage quit.For me it was solid ~40hours of gameplay and i won't miss a second.An amazing start to an amazing game series. Risen surely won't dissapoint you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have been playing PC games since the early 80s. This is what i would call a HARD CORE cRPG. You have to play the game, by that i mean your hand is not held to lead you to the next quest. It can be tough but once you get going it is awesome. If you want a challenge and dont want to be spoon feed then this is a great way to spend your time. On the final chapter after playing 52 hours. This game is worth any computer rpg fans time. Its not a easy game. You have to use the items you find to move forward. This game should not be missed.EDIT. I finished the game. Played for 67 hours, well worth the time and effort. Once done I purchased both Risen 2 ans Risen 3. Risen 1 was so good I am going to play the whole trilogy. If you are a PC RPG gamer do not miss Risen 1.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What can I say about Risen? If you enjoy games like Morrowind, Gothic, or anything similar to them then you'll enjoy this game. Even though it came out 6 years ago at the time of this review, it is still a fantastic game. You get to explore an island as a castaway and level up from fighting some rather difficult, but awesome creatures. You have to talk to teachers in order to level up, it's a nice change from what we're so used to nowadays. The graphics are alright but where this game nails it, is in the dialogue. The voice acting is fantastic and I wish more games were voiced like this one. I'd definitely recommend it. Wait for a sale though just because it's a little bit of an older game.

												Risen is a game based the Gothic franchise. Open World Action RPG. Unfortunately it does not do it nearly as well. The world is much smaller and not nearly as interested. Also far more linear exploration than in the Gothic games.The graphics are not the greatest and especially the character models hurt your experience. The sound is generally poor with the German to English translation really hurting your immersion.The leveling system and skill options are pretty good but very badly balanced leading to a huge difference in difficulty.The story is fairly standard, as is the world.Risen isn't a terrible game, it just doesn't measure up to the games it tries to emulate. The Might & Magic series, the Gothic series, even Morrowind provides a better exploration RPG experience and that just leaves you with a very underwhelming feeling after playing Risen.

												This is 5th time i've been trying to finish Risen 1 (not on this acc. though), always either i changed windows or something would happen, and today i've finally finished it.Combat is hard, you have to learn how it works, it's not just spamming left click till everyone dies - 'cause you'll end up dying A LOT. However Risen 1 is one of my favorite games because it's really atmospheric, nice looking (for 2009.), and music is beyond everything, it just fits with setting perfectly, music was actually reason why i love this game so much (<3 Kai Rosenkranz). I suggest everyone to set options like these: Music - 100%, Ambient 90%, Voice 70%, and other stuff at 50%, it just makes everything better. Most people don't like this game because it's ""hard"" it's not really when you learn how it works, it's not even comparable with Elder Scrolls, so if anyone love old school rpgs - Risen 1 will be perfect for you			",91,8,4,12,5,1,4

So save often. Bugs... Just two really. The wheel button stop working at some early point to draw your weapon. Just change the key. No prob. Second, the screen tremble for a few seconds now and then. No big deal. No crashes.Now, about the combat, it takes a while to get it right but you will. Then you'll see that is not that hard o bad, challenging as the rest of the game.

												This review was long overdue. Risen was the first RPG i've actually bought and played through and thorough. Ah..nostalgia...Now for the review-Overall - 8.5/10 (Must buy if you are a fan of fantasy-RPG..even in 2016, while i am writing this review..Its a gem)Story - 9/10 (Main quest line & side quests, the back story for the world are quite interestingly woven.)Atmosphere - 10/10 (Lush, vibrant, eerie at the right places)Combat Mechanics - 7.5/10 (Could improve a bit, but still very playable. I loved sword and shield. )Leveling Mechanics - 6/10 (Fairly simple. Needed to grind at places. Overall, could bear it)Factions & NPCs - 10/10 (The BEST part. The NPCs are really nicely scripted and are quite engrossing) Fanboy stuff -From the start, the world feels really fleshed put and snug and you'll be sucked right in. The atmosphere is really good and vibrant with little trinkets and gold coins hidden in nooks and on ledges and finding them is a joy. The factions are relateable and you can empathize with them. The NPCs are memorable and the towns are very richly populated. Questing is quite interesting. My only complaint was the rush towards the Main Quest ending.If you've read through all this, buy it and immerse yourself in the journey of the nameless hero of Faranga. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An intense revival of the free Gothic spirit.After all the storms that followed the breakup of Piranha Bytes and its former publisher JoWood. After all the tragedy and drama about third Gothic game that was to be the greatest game of all series...Piranha Bytes survived and made the game with the soul that we love, and a new and exciting new world, opened for an adventures and needed to be saved from the great evil!To lay down all the pathos, I say, game is not a perfect one. And it is dated, it runs well, but already looking like old-school, for it was made with scarce resources. Nonetheless, it's a fine adventure, an interesting open world with many characters, conflicts, and so on. What is more, it is a first game in the series, and Risen 2 & 3 games proved that world is full of life and deserves some dedication from players.Should you buy it now? Generally, yes. It's a fine open-world RPG, which connecting more sophisticated and modern newer Piranha Bytes projects with its roots, with the Gothic series. Hence it's a waystone, which is good in every RPG player collection. And it's a good game with the soul, a passionate one, so if you're not a full-time novelties hunter, give it a shot!8/10 epic efforts to save the world succeeded			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The real ""Gothic 4."" I prefer the story, setting, and factions in the Gothic games (Gothic's fantasy prison setting is way more interesting than Risen's rather generic tropical island), but ""Risen"" improves on the series in terms of gameplay. Combat is much easier to manage and while the open world does have some incredibly difficult enemies blocking off certain areas, they seem much less like arbitrary barriers as it's possible for the patient player to outwit and even destroy them early on (when I played, for example, I went exploring early on and accidentally found the best weapon in the game by running from/sniping the high level cave monsters guarding it. It isn't often that RPGs will let you just stumble onto and use high level main quest items before you even figure out what the main quest is). Like ""Gothic"" things degenerate into a linear monster grind in the very last hours of the game, but that's a minor quibble (someday PB will nail an ending...someday). Still, a great ARPG.

												★★★✯☆I really enjoyed Risen, the whole setup was quite a surprise, landing on the island as the victim of a shipwreck and then the story leading to where it does is quite unexpected. The gameplay works really nice, and all the little animations whenever you do something is really cool, especially for the time the game was made in. Your progression as a character (leveling) is limited to what trainers you can find, and from a realistic standpoint that makes a lot of sense, from a gameplay standpoint it's alright, keeps things interesting though. The spells are quite cool, and so is the diversity of the monsters in this game, hmmmm, don't really know what else to say about this game. It is a fun little game even though it is quite old by now it still holds up, and it gave me 31 hours of fun ... apart from the ending, the ending iiiiiiiiis satisfying but the fact that is the boss being killed in a cutscene and not in gameplay it is quite disappointing, and it isn't really even you that beats it ... other than that good game, 3.5/5!!! (That's with today’s standards, if it was compared to other games in its generation it would definitely have a higher score :) )			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A Gothic ""lite"" and a very good one:Out of all ""newer"" RPGs, I like this one the most. The combat system is the best out of all Piranha Bytes games, and the world is rich to explore. The story is ok (but I don´t care) and the gameplay is excellent. No waypoint markers (only on the world map, and they are deactivated at default), no auto movement bs, an no hand holding either. You are free to roam the island, and die if you´re not cautious - as it should be in every game! This game is very immersive...the spirit of Gothic is in there. So if you liked the brilliant Gothic games, you surely will like this one too....but what am I even talking to you...I bet you already played it ;)The only criticism I have is that it gets a bit to easy at the end - but than...almost every newer game is too easy from the beginning.Also keep in mind that the developers are making another very interesting game called ""Elex"", which will hopefully get back to the roots.

												With over 30+ hours into this game I can say this is one of the best role playing games I've ever played.Risen is a great hybrid of modern gaming sensability mixed with a heavy dose of classic old school game play. It's certainly not a game for everyone, and those looking for refined combat mechanics or hack and slash gameplay will be disappointed. At it's core, Risen is about exploration, communication, steady character improvement, and mystery solving. The story starts off pretty simple with a shipwrecked character that lacks any significant backstory. While modern gamers may see this as a negative, it's actually one of the game's greatest strengths. The whole idea of the classic RPG was to let your character forge a story as they interacted and played through the campaign. Risen grants players the freedom to choose a faction, choose their skills and talents, and ultimately decide to be a nice guy or a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You'll talk to people to solve quests that grant experience and rewards, play people against one another, and unlock the secrets of the island and the catastrophe plaguing the world.The other great stregnth of this game is exploration. The Island is a beautifully handcrafted and seamless world. It's large enough to allow you to take your time and explore every nook and cranny for enemy encounters, crafting materials and treasure, but not so big and generic that it ever feels tedious running around on your quests. Later in the game, it becomes much easier to move about and track down things you might have missed.So to wrap things up, here's a list of positives and negatives:Positives:- well crafted seamless world full of secrets and hours upon hours of exploration- camps and towns feel alive with NPCs who have various quests and belong to various factions with their own motivations- lots of skills to learn and items to find and craft- choose your path, and become a mage, fighter, rogue or a combination of any of those skillsetsNegatives:- combat feels a little stiff and clunky - can be frustrating to figure everything out at the start for newcomers to RPGsMy rating:☺☺☺☺☺Five happy faces!

												I'm a huge fan of RPGs, it's my favorite genre by far, and generally I'm hard to please. There's this certain kind of undefinable sublime quality of the Risen franchise, and with the first game in particular. It's in a fantasy setting, but with a gritty, hard-edged feeling that I immediately took a liking to. The game franchise shares a pedigree with the Gothic games (both developed by Piranha Bytes, but the Risen games having a seperate publisher) and I've read several times that in truth, the Risen franchise is really the spiritual successor of the Gothic games.You can spot the similarities between the two series easily. In both series you play a ""nameless hero"". You have no character customization in Risen, you start as a stowaway on an Inquisition ship that capsizes and sinks. You find yourself washed up on the shore of Faranga, a large volcanic, mediterranean-like island. The game is open world, limited of course by the fact that the game does, of course, take place on an island. No worries here, the island is quite large, with various climates and distinctive areas.As someone who loves to role-play, I really enjoyed playing a character that has virtually no back-story, not even a name. The game presents you oppourtunities to shape what kind of character you're going to be. Similar to the Witcher games, choices are often morally ambiguous. Neutrality is sometimes what the situations is called for, and often towing the line between being a hero or a heartless thug was really enjoyable.That, of course, can't last forever. Eventually you'll have to align yourself with one of the two factions struggling for control of Faranga. The quests are numerous, and surprisingly contain few ""fetch"" quests. The writing is excellent, in my opinion, and the voice-over work really quite well done. The developers don't exactly hold your hand when it comes to the often multilayerd and multistaged quests. A certain amount of cleverness is required of the player, and I've found wrapping up quests very rewarding.I chose to go the route of the Fighter, and I've found the combat very enjoyable. It requires mastering the use of block and parry, counter-parry and attack. Leveling your character is also an interesting experience. At each level you're given 10 learning points. Depending on what you're going for, you'll need to seek out the assistance of trainers who can help you increase your statistics and skills. Right away I invested in swordsmanship, and strength, but also in sneaking and lockpicking. I found that gathering a lot of ""thief"" skills was a fantastic (and fun) way to finance my adventures. You can also dedicate yourself to the Ranger-type character, or a magic-user. Or mix it up, which I definitely recommend.The game's visuals can sometimes leave a little bit to be desired, but truthfully I found I really enjoyed the style and the art in the game. It grew on me quickly, and I found myself snapping screenshots of areas and events I particularly liked.To be clear, I've not yet finished all of the game. I'm nearing Chapter 3, which I believe is the final chapter. During nearly all my playtime, I had to play in Steam's Offline mode so my tracked game time on Steam is lower than the actual number.To wrap up, I highly recommend this game to fans of the hand-crafted RPG. That kind of RPG that you can tell a team put their blood, sweat and tears into. It has huge depth, it's very rewarding. 4 out of 5 stars. Go get it.			",149,17,0,71,22,0,60

												I've read several comments about the combat which i found myself hooked in with like no other game had and loved how the story slightly changed by how you progressed though it while playing and making choices. 9/10 even played it twice, very few games i have played more than once.And for some reason i don't have my playtime.. sad.

												I picked this up in a bundle somewhere a while back and didn't really think much about it, I picked the bundle up for something else and this just happened to be in it. I spotted it in my library earlier today and headed off to the store page to see what it was and read a review that was basically saying ""Go play the game now!""So I did, and I'm so glad I did too! I've barely scratched the surface of this game and already have quests coming out my ears, I've died more times than I care to admit and still can't remember what buttons I need to be pressing a lot of the time, but I love it!It does seem to have some bugs, there have been times I can't draw my weapon in the usual way (thankfully there is another way around that, which I worked out in the end) and at one point I couldn't get my character to run, again I worked round it. These are only small annoyances though, and really only tiny once you realise there is a way around these problems.The graphics are great, considering this is a 2009 game, just make sure you have the graphics settings to high. The graphics and audio combined make quite the immersive world that really sucks you in, which is just what you want for an RPG.The game is far from easy, heck I died countless times before I'd really moved from my starting point! Things will kill you and they can and will kill you fast. Saving regularly is a must here unless you like replaying all that progress you just made. So far I'm really enjoying this and really glad that I just happened to pick it up, along with Risen 2, it is truly a hidden gem in my library that I'm glad I dusted off.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Risen starts out by giving the player a choice which side to join instead of just throwing them at a single storyline, this adding replay-value. Risen has easy, yet effective gameplay. You control your character easily which allows for dodging and blocking. Many games can learn from Risen's fun and immersive gameplay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Please ignore my playtime, i just bought it and i played it 5 or 6 times without steam.Risen is really nice, i bought it together with risen 2, and I like the first risen waaaaay better. It's from 2009, yes, but it is still really good and better than a lots of other modern RPGs. The Graphics are still good, sure there are better grphics now, but remember; its 5 years old and the graphics are really detailed, every corner of Faranga(thats how the island is called)was handmade, no generated s h i t. The enemys are not leveling up, which I really like cause its totally unrealistic when a wolf grows stronger and stronger and had at the end 10 times more damage. In Risen, there come new enemys when you enter a new chapter, and at these places where you shouldn't go at the beginning are harder enemys, real blockades are only at places for quests where it's simply nessesary. The Quest are realistic, too, I don't know why some people dont like them, I like these Quests more than  Kill-this-this-and-this-Quest, and there a lot of killing in Risen too.The combatsystem is reallly good too, dont know why some slimshady guys here find it annoying, its really diversified, there are five types of weapons; Axes, Swords(one and two-handed), Crossbows, Bows and Staffs. There are many different weapons of these categorys, mostly swords and axes.And there are magical weapons, fire, ice and something which does average damge and fires fast.I recommend to take an crossbow, better an ice crystal and a 2-handed sword or an axe.You can level your skills in these weapon category from 1 to 10, and at every skill u get a new attack or defense or somthing like that, because of that the combat never gets old like some guys wrote here. It's difficult, yes, but a game which is not challenging is really boring, isn't it?The Story is very free(didnt know who to wrote that), and because of that the story is not very good, but good. You can choose a lot of things in this game.In the End, I really recommend Risen, for players who start with RPGs and they who already played some.Oh, and for the guys, who are too dump to beat the game, if you tap really fast minsky in game and then tap ^, u can cheat  what u need. I didnt.And P.S.: You sure can find bugs, u can do this in every game, but if you dont do really really stupid things, there are less bugs, and even if one appear, you can solve the problem with the console.

												Dont think ive enjoyed a game like this since Fable 2. This game was hard to get into but as I had no internet I decided to give the game another go and it had me playing for awhile my save file had over 23 hours on it shame it didnt count towards my over all hours as I was offline. This game I would recommened if you played any of the fable series or any  adventure type game like the Elder scrolls series.  The worst problem I had with the game was how hard it was to find gold and earn gold but when you have the gold its much easier. But the good things about the game Combat was actually really enjoyable I wasnt to keen about the magic combat tho but never have been into magic in game always been a all guns blazing person.Story was also enjoyable and was intriuged to play more and more untill I was finished the game. its pretty long game I would say about 30-40 hours of gameplay from side quest and main quest but 100% completetion I would say longer.Oh and Lockpicking is a must have try getting as soon as possible TipKnow time to play the second game of the Franchise If I can get it working on my toaster :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was the secound RPG i`ve played , after the Fable.I don`t even know how i got this game but it was in the library and oh well ...At first this game is kinda hard.Pros:The storyline is good .A lot of sidequests.You can make a action in multiple ways ( ex: you have to take a item from an npc: 1.steal it 2.Buy it 3.Intimidate the npc so it gives the item by itself)Cons:You have to pay attention to the dialogues , if you miss the glu , you are kinda damnedThe combat is hard to deal with in first 2 hours , you will chosee to run from the enemiesCan`t do some actions because oh well , you can`t.I had to use the RisenWikia for some missions , but maybe i`m dumb.Overall : A good game i would buy it for maybe 3.74-4.99 ei`ve enjoyed it for about 40 hours.

												A truely amazing RPG, i always considered this to be crap because i never really heard anything about it and when i picked it up a few months back on a humble bundle sale its just sat in my library with the sequel. what a mistake this was. the game has such a good storyline and the combat is suitible in difficulty (not as hard as dark souls, but has more than a few moments where it looks liek your going to die, and probably do). the only downside to the game is that it isnt optimised very well and i encountered multiple bugs that hindered or downright stopped progression, it was easily fixed however via use of command line 'cheats', some would say ""ohh why did you cheat you noob"" etc but i regard it as being able to finish the game, for example a major bug i had was that every time i tried to climb my avatar would fall through the floor and get stuck resulting in myself having to use F9 to quick load, the way i got around this was to give myself a 100 levitation scrolls to combat all the times of the game where you need to climb (and there are quite a few). Overall id give the game a 8/10 and a recommendation to all fans of RPGs to get this game. Now im off to play the sequal, heres hoping its even better...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Important info: If you're having problems with climbing ledges (Character fly away into the air) and isnt falling the way he should, It's because the game is running at too high FPS. Limit the FPS by forcing V-Sync on in your graphic cards controls (Nvidia control panel for GeForce and Catalyst control center for Radeon), If that doesnt work you can turn down your GPU clock speed in MSI Afterburner, As long as you're below 200 FPS it should be fine.Great game btw!

Man, do I love making a sweetass sword.I found the storyline interesting, but can move a little slowly if you don't know when to run away.My only negative is that mana does not regenerate.. it is all replenished with sleeping or potions.I enjoyed the game immensely.

												Awesome RPG game, created by legendary Piranha Bytes.Main story is one of the big pros, 4 chapters where we know story of the island, people, inquisition and few plot twist.Side quests isn't that bad in playthrough, I have impression I already do this.AI in this game is funny, everything fight this same way, like attack, block or series of attack then block or counter attack player. Skill tree is really diffrence, we can do warrior with shield, mage using crystals and scrool or archer, smithing get us possibility to do weapons and jewelry with magic bonus, also we can level up you're character really fast, much creatures and NPC we can beat on low level.Open word is big pros in this game, we can discover everythink in first chapter.Graphic in this game is not bad and not awesome in some place and time of day looks really good.Final fight can be better, it's just looking on the floor and using shield, nothing hard.Pros:- Main story- Open word- Exploring- Skill tree- Side quests- GraphicCons:- AI like I say everything fight same way- Some bugs like character block on jump- Final fight8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Risen is one of the best games I've played as of late. The combat system, while simplistic as a whole, is very much unique in it's execution. The story is more complex than I imagined and the freedom of any action in the game having a consequence was horrifying and hilarious. The world is beatuiful, except for the ash beasts, they were not beautiful until I got a legendary weapon and made them a smear on the ground. It is a very linear story at the heart of it, but the different factions are interesting and diverse enough that I would honestly play the game just to experience each one. It was a gamble buying this game that I 100% do not regret. I highly reccomend it to anyone who favors anything I listed above.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The combat takes some time to learn to but once you get the hang of it you'll be cutting your way through the end.I don't know why but this game has that 'not so finished' atmosphere throughout the game.

												I awake washed up on a beach after a shipwreck.  I am one of two survivors.  The other survivor is a hot chick.  This is looking good.  She tells me to find a weapon to protect us so I bravely comb the beach for a club of some sort.  I don't find one but I do run into two rather large and vicious sea vultures.  They leave me alone until I loot the body they were feasting on.  Then they give chase!  I run away desperately looking for a weapon.  I run back to the hot chick for help but she just tells me to find the weapon!   Then I see it!  Right there next to the hot chick this entire time.  I pick up the wooden club but the sea vultures peck me to death before I figure out how to arm it and use it.  I lay dying on the beach watching the sea vultures attack the hot chick knowing she will soon join me.  Maybe it is for the best. Probably the best first five minutes of a video game I've ever played and will definitely be coming back for more!First Five Minutes of Game: 10 out of 10Hot Chick: 7 out of 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I want to give a short review of this game. I found the difficulty frustrating at certain points but nothing that some patience couldn't solve. This is NOT the game where you can just run into room and expect to live without careful planning. The plot was decent but nothing surprising. The game does make you feel like rising up the ranks as you can grow from a cast-away on a beach into the most important person in the game. One aspect of the story that I really enjoyed was that early on I was captured by the ""enemy"" due to my own incompetence and instead of ending the game there I was taken to the monastery and trained to be a warrior of the inquisition. My very path being changed completely due to a mistake I did early on was an extremely refreshing change from normal RPGs and I applaud the devs for that decision.Overall I did enjoy the game even though some design decisions and bugs had me frustrated. I give it a solid 7/10 and a must-play for hardcore RPG fans and I recommendation for purchase in a sale for the others.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a pretty good game. It gives you a looot of choices as to what you want to do quest-wise, like you can either accept a quest or cancel it by killing the guy asking for it, and you're pretty free to do what you want. There are times where it gets kinda slow but I like the game overall.			",24,7,0,6,0,0,1

												This is kind of game I was looking for after playing Morrowind - it is a hardcore RPG where everything is there to make you really feel you are a survivor on an unknown mysterious island and your choices are up to you. You know nothing at the beginning and every training is real - you need a proper group to learn from and you need money for that. And it is not annoying. I really like even the fighting system, where if you don't follow instruction, you will end up beaten, but if you do, you can win even against a stronger opponent. So I would advice you to download their demo and find out for yourself - because it may not fit everyone's playing style, but definitely it has high quality			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Risen is a throwback to the days when Gothic 1 and Gothic 2 were considered kings of RPGs. After Piranha Bytes failed with Gothic 3, and the franchise went to other developers, they cut back on ambition and delivered an experience much like Gothic 1. This experience consists of being a funny bigmouth, that starts as a complete newcomer and nobody in a fairly isolated, but lively territory, full of political intrigues, other bigmouths and hordes of monsters that will help you advance in your career as the local tough guy. The game is very combat-centric, and quite tough, but also very rewarding - every new piece of gear or move is a big thing in Risen, and might spell doom for the monster that you weren't able to take on previously, and, thus, allow you to explore some more of the fairly beautiful world. Other attractions include dealing with pirates, smoking (swamp)weed and searching unsuccessfully for a guy you're supposed to meet in a brothel. And lots more!the biggest downside this game has (and the previous gothic games, too, really) is the radical difference between early-to-mid game and late-game. just be prepared that this game becomes more and more combat-centric the deeper you get.totally recommended, though.

												Risen is.... a good game. But very hard. At least, to me it is. It actually took me more than an hour to start enjoying Risen but once I got into it I couldn't stop playing. The Dialogue is hilarious at times and the main character often insults others in very amusing ways. The game is realistic in it's day and night and weather cycles and also how NPCs treat you based on how you treat them. There are many different abilities to teach your character and the game allows you to chose your own play-stlye. There are also usually multiple ways to complete quests which is a plus. Obtaining new/better armor can often take quite a while but feels quite rewarding when you do so. There are only a few things I dislike about Risen. First, you can't customize your character at all. I know some people don't care about this but in all honesty the main character isn't that great looking and it would have been nice if I could have changed his looks. Second, the combat is very difficult. Unless you are already a hardcore action gamer when you start playing Risen you will most likely have trouble with the combat at first. You can't just mash the attack button and whack things to death like in Diablo. Every fight, even with the weakest enemies requires patience and strategy. Granted once you start getting better at the combat it becomes a little more fun, it often feels repetitive or tedious. Aside from this though, the game in itself is a very fun play and I would reccomend it to anyone who is looking for a good challenge or even simply something to take up a good dozen hours of their time.

												Basically Gothic not called Gothic, but Risen. Game mechanics are really similar, the gameplay, characters and even some monsters resemble Gothic a lot, which can be taken as positive since especially Gothic 2 was one of the best RPGs I have ever played. But back to Risen, it has nicely crafted story and the world, quests tend to be very repetitive and simple with some exceptions, but overall, progressing through story, getting better equipment and skills is satisfactory.

												When I saw the standard steam question ""would you recommend this game"", I was a bit torn appart, because I really dont know. A yes and no would be the most precise answer.As a Gothic fan, I can see in Risen as its true follow up . It has all the playable elements that made Gothic a great game, such as the full open world , the way you develop the character and a well structured set of quests that gets you familiarized with the map, in case you arent a completionist player. The combat, is very frustrating indeed - but what people fail to realize is that it is also quite realistic in principle. Do people really expect to fight a pack of wolves with a stick without facing a serious risk of dying? The good part of Risen is also the amazing auto-save in key places. Again the comparison with Gothic is unavoidable... I am pretty sure that any former player would progress a lot without saving only to get killed by a crappy enemy, just because the fight went slightly south. With Risen and the constant auto-save, those frustrating moments when you realize that you just lost 2 hous of progress are over.That being said, now the downside of Risen. For an open world game, it doesnt seem to offer much enthusiasm to go and try to find something new. Wherever you go in the island, everything seems the copy from one or another place. There arent enough hidden places, new creatures or rewards that would make the exploring part worthwhile. It is the sort of game that if you stick to the main story, you won't feel that you have lost much, when it should be exactly the opposite. When it is a full open world, the whole point is to explore and try to get something more out of it that the main plot doesnt seem to offer.The story is bland and not at all interesting. I assume that at this point I am 3/4ths of completing it, and I am yet to find something that wouldnt be the same old, same old. I guess that the most original thing that I have seen is that if you get caught too early from certain NPCs, they will knock you on the head and force you to stick with a pre-set class type.Other minor thing is the lack of colour contrast , which makes it difficult to distinguish one place to another or even carry on playing without getting a blurry vision. Colour transitions are just too smooth.So, I would recommend the game if you played gothic and liked it... but prepare to be slightly disapointed. If not, perhaps it would best for you to start with something else first. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Game features one of the most beautiful worlds (for its time) and one of the least well drawn women.In my opinion this is second best Piranha Bytes game after “Gothic II” (though original “Gothic” is really great, too). What we have here is an open world (but if some places are closed in the beginning for story reasons, and others’ dwellers beat the crap out of you if you go there too early), fairly interesting story, three ways to develop your character by joining one of two factions, fencing system that gets more complicated and effective when you upgrade your skills. Levelling up here just like original “Gothic” games require a mentor, which is good, and not all the skills are available for all the factions. Besides combat skills there are crafting, magical and thievery skills. Story is divided into few chapters, and finishing one changes a world a bit, adding some secondary quests and new enemies.Overall this role-playing game definitely worth a play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was shamefully over shadowed by Oblivion (and similar big name games). You can check out other reviews, they will agree. This game is flat out amazing. Scenery, voice acting ( Andy  Serkis(Gollum LOTR) the Inquisitor and John Rhys-Davies (Gimli LOTR), as well as other HUGE actors that made you WANT to talk to NPC's instead of because you had to because you might miss something. This in itself made the game more immersive and drew you in as each of the NPC's felt they had their own personalities - something I felt OBLIVION lacked sorely.For a game from 2009, the scenery was breathtaking. Even on standard settings, the folilage and buildings all felt natural and the colors blended in very nice.Combat, training and other ""highlights"" of the game were awkward at first. If your coming from a hack/slash game, be prepared to put the brakes on. Pulling that tactic in this game will get you killed on the first swing. It is completely different than most games. It really does require training (which takes lots of gold - which in itself is hard to come by). This made it feel more challenging, and required you to pay attention to your fighting, vs, just spaming hot keys. Blocking plays an important rule - fail, and you'll find yourself on the end of a booger-picking-gnome-sword.  Bosses can be tricky, but there is usually a ""back-door"" method to taking them out, if you are not skilled enough to fight them head on.While the game is a touch of linear - it is not forced. It does a good job keeping you on the storyline, but at the same time, you can go off and do other tasks for other NPC's or just explore and get more experienced.  Risen does a fantastic job making you feel you are on your own. and doing thing when you want to vs letting the game feel like its controlling you. This is very apparent when you come to a cliff, and you can actually fall off - so far, I have not seen any ""invisible walls"" that prevent you from going anywhere.speaking of going places, the mapping system seemed much more real. Must like real life. There were no cheat arrrows pointing the way. It was just that, a map of the area you were in. It would show where you were at, but didnt hold your hand. Which was bad for me, since my memory sux (happens when you get old like me).  This alone, made questing quite a challenge, as while some POI was on the map, it was more of a reference point than a ""go this way and that way"". So you had to really pay attention to the NPC's that were giving out the tasks. Fortuneatly there is a script in your logs so you can re-read what you were told. There was only one tiny downer. I did not care much for the models or their behavior. Their hands seemed disjointed, and most the women you talk to always had one hand on their hip in a pose fashion.  While this is no SquareEnix game, I felt some of the action of the models could have been better. But after awhile, you kinda got aclimated to it, and didnt think twice.In my opinion, at 2014, this game still rivals most RPG/OPEN WORLD games on the market today - and any RPG fan would really enjoy it. The learning curve is high - espceially the combat. But if you can get over that hump, you'll find a very rich and enjoyable game that will last over 40-60hrs (I am a leisure completionist   http://www.howlongtobeat.com/game.php?id=7843 ). I feel that the outstanding voice acting is what makes players get deeper involved with the cast, and thus explore more.So pick it up. The only advise i can give, be patient in fights, keep your guard up.			",192,104,3,101,49,1,31

												This game had so much potential.  It's almost like a Skyrim/Morrowind light.  Far smaller, simpler quests, but a decent world.  The BIGGEST drawback is the combat system.  It is not for the casual player.  If you want to just relax and crush some mob faces, this is not for you.  This game is big on player timed dodges, parries, and blocks.  Nothing is automatic.  The enemy can also parry, dodge, and block depending on their gear loadout.  This means you have to know how each and every mob likes to attack and tailor a different strategy for each and every mob type in the game.  You also have to know what attacks mobs can use based on the gear and type.  You can't just charge in and swing, you have to block, parry, dodge, counter-parry, and charge attack.  The margin for error is very small, especially on the hardest difficulty.  On one skeleton lord, It took about 35 strikes for me to kill it, while he would kill me in 3 hits.  This was pretty early on in the game but still, VERY little margin for error.  Wolves you have to lure into a tight pass where they can't dodge attack you, which is instant and practically unblockable.  Pro tip- Every mob in this game likes to circle to their left, which is to your right.  Strafe to the right as well to cut them off (footwork and positioning actually matters in this game)and stay away from their weapon hand.  If they lateral strike (yes there are also different swings and angles of attack based on your movement) and you dodge left you will still get clipped. All that said, difficult/strategic combat and all, the BIGGEST flaw is the stupid console based forced focus system.  Holy %$#@ is that annoying for a PC user.  I get 3 boars charging me, I pull my sword and it sticky focuses the middle one, I strafe and it goes around the target and into the swings of another boar because your actions are based around your target, not just on your personal character control.  Developers just don't get how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ forced focus sticky targeting is compared to what PC users are used to (since xbox has no mouseplay).All in all I did enjoy playing this game but it can be fantastically furiously frustrating at times because of the combat.  Oh and the clipping in this game is terrible.  Save often, you WILL fall through the world a LOT.  If I had a swear jar next to my PC I could have bought a new PC.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When I bought the game, after my first 7 hours in, wandering aimlessly, being annoyed by the combat system and not really feeling engaged by the story, I uninstalled the game.About a year later, I decided to give it another chance and started anew. I don't know why, but all the things I loved about the Gothic series, I now started to like about Risen. Perhaps my expectations were too high, initially. Is Risen better than Gothic? No. By far not. Gothic is a classic. Risen is a good game that will likely grow on you. I gave Gothic a 8.7 out of 10, Risen is a 7.6 for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't know what it is about these Pirhana Bytes games that keeps me so entertained. The Gothic series culminated in two games reknowned for their broken-ness but I still have played them for hundreds of hours and managed to enjoy myself. Risen is basically what Gothic 3 should have been (albeit with a different setting and plot but there are many similarities). The combat system is monumentally better and you can actually cast a spell without dying. The voice acting is still pretty terrible but you can get the picture and it doesn't detract too much from the game. People have likened the games to a low quality Elder Scrolls but the only real similarities are the open world and ... swords. Obviously the Elder Scrolls is better on an order of magnitude that can't be described but if you're into open world medieval settings and a pretty unique universe I'd say give it a go. It's worth the price.			",346,88,5,77,58,2,89

												Got chased by some scary ogres so I drove them to an immortal NPC to kill them for me, then sold some weed to some guy, stole it from him then sold it to him again. Brugle/10Don't get fooled my my 6hr game time, I have 60+ hours after finishing the game in offline mode (Steam needs to fix this)The combat is challenging and fun even if it's too simple, the game has a simple RPG format, it drives you to finish it once you start playing, much like other RPGs.The game has a decent soundtrack, the graphics are fine even though the character models aren't really pretty and are too repetitiveThe leveling up system is a bit mixed up and not easy to understand at first, you need to play to level up your skills , you can't do that without money which you'll only get later in game.Voice acting can be really shallow at times.But what I like most about this game is the replay value, the quests aren't repetitive, and each playthrough can have different outcomes.Yes, I would recommend this game and I'm going to play the sequel soon.

												Worth the money thats for sure, its a good RPG that doesn't hold your hand, the combat can take a while of getting used to but it's rewarding when you figure it out because it requires thought instead of button mashing which will get you your♥♥♥♥♥handed to if you do, you actually start off as a complete joke with nothing but a stick and you'll probably be like 10 hours into the game until you start getting good weapons/armour.The main story is pretty meh but i find the side quest's to be the most interesting, they're nothing amazing but they're fun and quite varied.The graphics are gorgeous, the same during a sunset is one of the best sunsets you'll ever see in a video game and when you're strolling through the forest it looks amazing and the atmosphere is even better.Its a very relaxing and atmospheric RPG, alot of the quest's dont involve any combat at all so you can just sit back and play it with a beer in one hand too.Its not the most amazing game and its no classic but if you want a cheap RPG to satisfy your RPG thirst then this should be an instabuy, if you don't like RPG's you'll hate this, if you love RPG's you'll love this.

												I bought this game because it was on sale and it had good reviews, so i thought ""why not"".I started this game with no expectations or any knowledge on how anything in this game worked. I was quit disappointed in how it turned out to be. Please also note that i played as a bandit. (sword & shield) I chose the bandit lifestyle, because instead of going to the city, i went exploring and ended up at the bandit camp, while doing their quests, i felt like i bonded with them, so after i was sent to the city, i decided to follow their way.Things i liked:Grapohics. Seeing as this game is from 2009, i was surprised it looked so good.Leveling system. When you gain a level, you get 10 learning points, which you can spent on upgrading you skills.Storyline. I enjoyed the story and how things developed.Saving.You're able to save and quicksave, even during battle.Potions.There are health/mana potions next to the food and herbs you collect.Things i did not like.Weapons/gear.To do damage, you need a decent weapon and appropriate skill(s). You start doing decent damage when you upgrade your sword skill to level 7. I upgraded this very late in the game, because i was upgradig my (cross)bow skills and my secondary skills, like sneaking & pickpocketing too. My damage output was weak.My gear in the beginning was weak too, i could not handle the damage from the enemy, so i died often. There are barely any options to really upgrade your gear, so you're stuck for a long time with what you have.It seems this game favours the staff for the mages and the sword for the bandit. There were so many options to buy swords, but i barely saw any axes being sold, making it quite useless to spent talent points in axes. Even if you like swinging with axes and decide to upgrade the skill, in chapter 4, you will be collecting a special kind of armour. 1 of the items is a weapon with +6 axe skill. This is a mandatory weapon. So if you already spend more then 4 points in it, you wasted gold and learning points here.Imo, it is a shame that when there are 3 options, only 2 can reach their full potential.Combat.In the beginning you can do a chain attack consisting of 3 strikes, if your attack is disrupted, the enemy is able to attack you. If you are being hit, you stragger, making you move backwards and unable to atack. Often i was killed by the enemies chainattacks, because i could simply not move. This was really frustrating.While you're hitting enemy, they're able to parry/block all your moves. You can move around and try to hit them from their side, but they can turn instantly, making it very hard to hit them from the back or sides. Every enemy you face, had full skills unlocked. This means, they can parry/block, counterparry and break your block. Because of this and the weak gear, i died often. Often you're also facing 2-3 enemies at the same time. When you're being hit from behind, you get 1.5x / 2x the damage you would normally get, making your life even more difficult.While i was attempting to hit, my moves were blocked with ease, but at the same time, when they were hitting me, they had not problem reducing my health eventhough i was blocking. My only tactic was to block their strike, then attack, block again, then strike. Sometimes a battle could take 15 min, because of multiple enemies i had to defeat.Of course there is the option to dodge by double tapping the wasd buttons, but this has to be timed perfectly and the enemy attacks seem to be too random.Money.During your quests and sometimes when lotting enemies, you gain gold. Only problem is that everything is so expensive Weapons and armour are expensive, upgradraing all your skills gradually gets expensive and sometimes you need to buy stuff for quests. Since i chose the bandit life, i was able to buy gear over the course of the game. First piece was 500 gold, 2nd, 1000 gold, 3rd 2k gold, 4th 5k gold. So you do earn some gold along the way, but it is spent 10x as fastYou barely earn any money to upgrade your skills in the beginning.Primary stats.The primary stats are strength, dexterity and wisdom.Again, i played bandit, so strength & dexterity were the stats i had to upgrade. Strength makes you do more damage, but  the higher the stat, the better weapons you can wield. This goes for swords, staves and the crossbow. Same goes for dexterity, but this is exclusively for the bow. The higher the stat, the more damage you do and the better the weapon you can wield.  Upgrading your skills or stats will cost you learning points. 5 for stats, 10 for skills. Eacht time you upgrade either, it costs more money. I spent a lot of skill points and money on upgrading those stats. Later in the game you can find recipes to make potions that upgrade your stats, so i recommend you save all the herbs you find that has extra text other than stating ""recover x-amount of health/mana"".While it costs a lot of resources for me to upgrade my mainstats, the mage has it super easy. They need strength, to wield staves and wisdom, for magic. As far as i know, wisdow can only be gained by reading books on stands you find all over the would. At one time, i had more wisdom than strength, which♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥my off, because while i am spending that much on my mainstat, my wisdom gets upgraded for free and i cannot even use that stat.Things i found weird.JumpingWhile you're jumping, you take quit a leap, it looks like you're flying.Often while jumping, you get stuck and are not able to move. Or when you're leaping from object to object and you do not really make it, you are floating in the air, instead of falling to your doom. You're still able to make the jump, which has saved my life many times.When jumping direcly off from the edge, bridge or any other high place, you died. This is normal. But when you closely stick to the edge and just lightly tap either wasd button, you could savely reach the ground from a very high place. This saved my a lot of traveling time, but it is weird nonetheless.The last boss.Unfortunaltey, you're not able to see its health, so you do not know when you fight is going to be over.The fight is surprisingly easy. Fighting a lizard is at least 10x harder as a bandit.3 classes.There is the bandit, mage and a hybrid between them, a warrior that uses spells in combat. ( cannot tell much on that subject. )It seems this game favours the mage. As a bandit i had trouble killing enemies. Fights taking 5 min. Getting 2-3 shotted all the time, or getting chainraped. Seeing combat done mages really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. All they have to do is use ""magic bullet"" and their enemies drop at a distance. All they have to worry about is enough strength to wield their staves and upgrading their mana pool, which only costs 5 learning points each time. And again, free wisdom points.No special attacks.As a bandit i could just do melee attack, swinging my sword and blocking. When upgrading your skill, you could make power attacks, but that was allAs a mage you could at learn 2 elemental attacks.My conclusion.It seems i choose a really hard life as a bandit. I spent more time dying than actually enjoying playing this game. Enemies were too overpowerd, especially the lizards later on. They were able to parry my attack and counter parry with a huge damage blow, either isntanly killing me or barely killing me, forcing me to flee from battle.I kept on playing, because i liked the story and wanted to see what would happen. If i had to do everything over again, i would have chosen the easy life, playing the mage. Because there is such a huge, unfair power gap betweens those classes, i cannot really recommend the game, eventhough i did enjoy it from time to time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A positive surprise. I've had this game forever and got it from some bundle. I decided to give it a try and I've never felt so bad for not trying a game earlier. The game has loads of your basic RPG elements, but there's some very unique ones too. Interaction.First thing that I noticed was how the interaction and fighting is implemented. You use middle mouse button to either draw or sheathe your weapon. While your weapon is drawn, you're in battle mode where you can't interact with anything other than hit stuff with your weapon. While your weapon is away, you can loot, talk and interact with items. It's a great way to prevent you from accidentally hitting people while still making it possible to easily start slaughtering everyone, if you so wish. Combat. It's hard. Closest comparison in my mind would be Dark Souls. The enemies dodge, parry and use multiple different combinations to attact you, they deal loads of damage and are a serious pain in the♥♥♥♥♥if there are more than 1. You'll soon learn to quick save after every succesful battle / anything actually, since even after learning to fight against a single enemy they might just destroy you anyway with a long combo and powerful attacks.Leveling up. Instead of just gaining levels and being able to choose attributes to increase on a stat screen, you gain points that can be used to have a trainer teach you skills. I don't know if I skipped some hints, but I definitely didn't know this for a while. I ended up playing 3-4 hours without improving my skills. I don't need to tell you that it was pretty hard. Trainers can teach you to increase your strenght and weapons skills, as well as learn how to prospect or gut animals.Quests.Standard RPG quests. You talk to people, run to someone else, kill stuff, help people, etc. Nothing too new, but some freedom to do things. For example you can kill a lot of creatures early and start the quest later and finish it right away with the creatures being dead.BugsThe most noticeable bugs I had was the one related to Vsync. I basically couldn't jump up on ledges as I would get stuck, and I couldn't die from falling. The next one I noticed was that you're allowed to enter chapter 3 area before actually taking the quest for it. This caused me to not be able to progress and having to lose 2 hours of gameplay. The game looks slightly old, but not bad. It's loads of fun to play and I'd recommend it to anyone.My favourite thing? There doesn't seem to be any kind of inventory limit.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of those game that deserve a neutral rating if Steam has one. Risen is an open world RPG, you are stranded on a island and has to join force with local factions and help them with their agendas to survive. I've only played a few hours at this point but the story is bland and uninteresting, VO can be all over the place. Most of the time it's not good.Graphically RIsen can be a mixed bag. Flora looks good, environment is ok for a 2009 game but NPC looks bad. Design is bland and the town is pretty ugly.As for the game play, Risen is play in third person view and structurally similar to other open world RPG, you wander around, explore and getting tons of quests. If you've played an open world RPG before like fallout, elder scroll  or the gothic series; you already know the general flow of the game.The combat in this game is quite clunky, you can equip 2 weapon, one melee/staff, one range weapon. You don't have a lot of option for melee combat, just an attack and block button, range weapon is very slow but enemies are very easy to kite.The leveling system is obtuse, you gained learning points after a level but can't spend them unless you go see a trainer and pay them gold to get stats increase. This lead to hilarious situation where you're in a school supposedly learning things but can't get any stats increase because there's no easy way to make money. This make the early game quite difficult since quest payout is 20/30 gold while you need increasingly more money to gain stats. 1 stat point cost 10-20 gold and you earned 10 stat points per level. Basically you will have to try and scavenge everything.Depends on how you play the game though. the problem above can be completely trivial. You can get 1 point in sneaking and pickpocketing and proceed to steal everything from everyone. I became filthy rich just 30 mins after getting the skills and this broke the economy. Stealing is really easy in this game and require no trick, just engage in a conversation option and steal. I stole a soldier's shield as I was talking to him once, it's pretty funny.Quest design is my biggest complain about this game, in open world rpg a good developer would give you multiple options to finish a quest. Not really the case in risen. people in this game are very easily agro if you are in a room and open a chest you're not supposed to. I accidentally agro an NPC and proceed to woop his♥♥♥♥♥and he refused to talk to me afterward thus making it impossible for me to finish a quest that involving him (you can get a spell to make them forget but in the early game I have I've only found 1 scroll so far). In another instant, I was supposed to get training from some dude, he made me fight him as a test, I won but click 1 time too much and he's dead, another impossible to finish quest. Worst of all these quest chains are necessary for you to get out of the monastery and I was stuck with no option to go out. Luckily I found a place to hop the fence and book it.Despite all the ♥♥♥♥♥ing I've done, Risen still compelled me enough to play for more than 2 hour at a time and write a review for it. This is more than I can say for the CODs and♥♥♥♥♥creed out there. As clunky as it is, wandering around and ♥♥♥♥ing with the local NPCs is fun. However, when you look at it objectively, RIsen is not a good game, there are good ideas in it but it's too clunkly and in some cases poorly implement. There are much better open world RPG out there, the Gothic series, its predecessor is one example. I can only recommend this game if you are a big fan of open world RPG and has exhausted all of your other options. Overall a 6/10 for me and recommendation with serious reservations.

												This game is not a straight up hack/slash and level RPG. You need to dodge, block, and move to get the right hits in. After you get enough experiance to get to the next level you gain 10 LP (lurning points). The LP can be spent at trainers in addition to gold to improve your skills. I recomened getting sneak and lock picking so you always have money. Find beds to sleep in and water barrels to drink from. In my playthrough I ended the game with 200 strength. My last playthrough was 36 hours. Its not for every one but it is fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												RisenWhat should i say, its a beatiful game, the quests are well thought out and all your questions will be answered  everytime you just have to search and discover, you have so many ways to solve the quests. The Humor of that main character is just sometimes really funny and sometimes really dry, but all-in-one it can also be entertaining. While i playing the game, i've had some bugs with the jumping system, but it was alright.If you are at the beginning of the game, you would not think at all that the game would end like this. There are 4 chapters where you think what might just come because you've already done so many quests and do not expect it to get better and more exciting.10/10 One of my Top 3 Games of all time!

												Great game for fans of Gothic series.If you are not Gothic fan then I don't suggest you to play this game.Why ? Cause many people nowdays search for games like Dragon Age and Skyrim, this game doesnt delivery in that ""epicness i am chosen hero stuff"". Because this game is telling a mediocre story. Story puts you in a situation were you have to build yourself to become someone. You are not chosen one. You have to try to become one. It doesnt hold your hand in a way were you swing your sword and kill everthing. No! This game wants you to build and to train. Even a bird at the start of game can kill you!It gives you three choices: Mage (Magic) ,Inquisitor (Warrior/small magic) , Fighter/Bandit (Warrior)When you pick one of these three you have to work your♥♥♥♥♥to learn something. You have to have experience points to progress futher, to be able to kill a f*cking bird or a simple wolf.Thats what i like about the game. It reminds me alot of Gothic series wich are my favorite games of all times.If you are Gothic fan then buy this game you will not be disappointed.If you are one of those who seek a game where needs hand holding,God chosen heroes. Then look somewhere else weakling. This game puts hair on your chest and makes you feel like a man when you kill wild boar!!!			",49,0,4,4,2,0,9

												An open world 3D RPG. The world isn't enormous, but isn't small either. The story isn't long, but isn't short either. The typical RPG stuff is here: quests, crafting, leveling up.Some of the best stuff is finding out how to beat hard situations by using some of the game's design against itself, like when I lured hard to kill monsters to an invincible NPC and made sure to get the last hit in so my character still received experience and loot. It adds another level of play that the developers probably hadn't intended.			",2496,1033,91,242,342,29,388

												Perhaps one of the more underrated RPGs I've ever run across, Risen continues Pirahna Bytes' legacy of telling a familiar story in an exceptional way. Much like its Gothic predecessors, Risen puts the player in the shoes of an unnamed hero in an open world where resources and monsters do not periodically respawn and where the smallest mistake can punish you gravely.The gameplay is simple but hard to master. It rewards those who grasp the need for timing and prediction as  Risen's enemies rarely signal their attacks and fighting large mobs of enemies is usually suicidal in part due the game's frustratingly flawed lock on system.  However, progression in combat skills offers flexibility in getting under an opponent's defenses rather than mere brute force, making combat somewhat easier, but requiring some level of brains to use it.Risen isn't a typical hack and slash RPG, it is nothing like the Elder Scrolls series either. It is fairly punishing from the early and middle game but offers a sense of accomplishment through its finite resources and respawns and unique items only available in some of the most treacherous dungeons. Graphically Risen isn't the most polished looking game in existence. Character models tend to look a little bland at times with tons of noticeable reuse popping up everywhere, but the tropical setting coupled with some of the mediterranean inspired architecture presents for a fairly interesting looking world once you get over the myriad of familiar faces. And unlike most open RPGS, Risen barely has any loading times outside of the initial start up--the world and all its dungeons are in one single zone rather than being divided into seperate ones--making for one of the most immersive RPGS I've ever played. If you're a fan of old school RPGs, try out Risen as you might just like it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's quite a bit similar to the first Gothic (I've played only this one) in terms of gameplay, factions, monsters, the way you learn new skills or even how the plot develops (don't worry, it's not the same). Combat system it's pretty simple on the one hand, but will cause some frustration sooner or later. Also it wouldn't be Gothic's successor without few awkward animations.Our protagonist is chilled, cynical guy, he doesn't stand out - some may like him, others not.

The thing I also liked about killing and gathering quests was that you could make progress in them even without ""starting"" them.

												This game starts out hard. The unforgiving, really freaking hardness that makes you quit, cheat, or reload save games a LOT (death is permanent there FPS junkies!). For graphics, the human models are definitely dated but the flora, fauna and non-human entities are still quite good today (2014). The scenery might not be Witcher 2 quality, but it comes decently close. The night and day cycle with changing weather also makes running around the island an enjoyable experiance (bring a torch, it's scary out there in the dark!).That said, this game drew me right in after I got past the constant whooping that I received by boars (yeah, pigs kicked my tush and I couldn't do anything about it for a while). I believe it was the muscial score that really slapped me in the face and made me stick it out.There are two factions - the outlaws in the swamp and the mages in the town. Interestingly enough, your choice of which faction to join *can* heavily influence your weapon choices and whether or not you use offensive magic. Scrolls, which don't use up mana, can be used even by full on melee characters and are a requirement later in the game.If you are caught stealing, the people near you attack! They won't like you much afterward, but you can cast a Joke scroll on them to make them laugh which makes them tolerate you again. Now that is an interesting mechanic, as I had knocked out several NPCs after being caught stealing only to be able to do business with them later with a Joke scroll.Melee and bow/crossbow combat is simple but elegant, with the only downside being able to effectively attack AND block. Some enemies can score 3 hits in quick succesion on you if you try to attack at the wrong time. Zooming in (manual aim) with a crossbow resets your FOV distance for your character, which is a bit annoying but not game breaking.The storytelling is pretty darned good in this game - I was drawn in and actually cared not just for my character, but for several other NPCs throughout my questing.You may be on a fairly small island, but there is a LOT to do and even more nooks and crannies to explore. All the while the musical score wowed me - yes it repeats, but it really clinches the deal and makes this an amazing game. I honestly didn't mind stopping to pick the plants that are everywere all while I listened to the haunting (almost goosebump giving) music.I am very, very happy to have come across this game years after its release. To be drawn in by the beautiful tropical island landscape, to lose myself in the music and story, and to jump right out of my skin when a skeleton bursts out of a just raided tomb makes this an almost perfect game - 95/100. If you appreciate a little more structure than the Elder Scrolls series with a smaller world, you will love this game. Well, provided the boars don't make you quit ;-D			",256,21,7,37,18,0,42

												It's quite a bit similar to the first Gothic (I've played only this one) in terms of gameplay, factions, monsters, the way you learn new skills or even how the plot develops (don't worry, it's not the same). Combat system it's pretty simple on the one hand, but will cause some frustration sooner or later. Also it wouldn't be Gothic's successor without few awkward animations.Our protagonist is chilled, cynical guy, he doesn't stand out - some may like him, others not. Same goes for the other ingame characters, they are pretty average. Not many memorable personas in my opinion, but game on it's own... hell yeah.

												A very good RPG. Not very long and pretty varied in its gameplay. The story isn't particulary bright, but at least it exists. What shines is the wonderful island where the game takes place. It's not huge, but it's packed with things to do and mostly interesting characters.The combat system may be frustrating at first, but becomes far more interesting as the game progresses. It's a bit repetitive, but you need to stay focused which helps break the feeling of doing always the same thing.At the beginning of the game (first chapter on four), you mostly avoid enemies, rather focusing on dialogs and quests. I absolutely love this part though many players will be longing for some action.During the second chapter, you really go around exploring every nook and cranny of the island. This may be the part I like the least because of the large number of savage animals you need to wipe out. It's a bit tedious sometimes. Then again, you're not required to completely clean the island. But I'm a bit of a completionist.Chapters 3 and 4 are shorter and will let you explore bigger caves and dungeons. I also really liked this part though it feels like a completely different game than the first chapter. Ennemies are tough but less numerous. There are lots of traps and exploration and light puzzles to keep you occupied. I was afraid it would be more Diablo-like, but no. It's still a RPG.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is hard, no doubt about that. The combat actually demands of you to think for yourself before attacking. The length and difficulty of this game maek it challenging. But the entire world breathes life and you really want to explore the entire island and find all the secrets it has tucked away in all the nooks and crannies.Despite the 38 hours I put into it, I get the feeling I have only seen about 80% of it.

												The game offers an atmospheric island with a beautifully designed city and some different landscapes (I really liked the swamp). I have to admit that some of the inhabitants look incestuously similar, but this little deficiency gets perfectly compensated by the fact that all of them have the gift of gap, resulting in humorous and interesting conversations. Although many quests are to get/deliver something to someone, they are well linked into gameplay. The ruins are kind of similar to each other, but (in my opinion) still more diverse than e.g. in Skyrim (although I also liked that game a lot).The final phase of the game unfortunately loses a bit of its charm in comparison to the beginning but, altogether, it was a great game for me.8/10 ",124,41,4,9,14,2,11

												a real RPG experience. you start the game by being washed up on the shore after a shipwreck and have to survive on an island full of wild beasts, monsters, bandits, and a not-so-nice religious order. there are plenty of ways to build your characters skills and abilities, the only part this game lacks is the ability to customize how your character looks. however, the weapons and armor are unique enough to prevent you from getting bored with your appearance.the combat is excellent, hard enough to provide a challenge, but still fluid enough so that you dont get stuck.the story is interesting enough to keep you going with a sense of purpose and keeps a steady pace with your progress in the game.the dialogue provides you with plenty of opportunities to establish your characters moral alignment and faction loyalties.

												Risen is one of the better RPG I ever played, good narative, plenty of interesting and fun quests, nice voice over's, stuning graphics, in short I love it.About the gamplay:In the begining everything is hard, and I mean extremly hard, even the simplest enemies ar tough to kill, a simple stingrat can kill you in 2-4 blows. Fighting in the begining is long and demanding due to you'r low hp and low damage you can do. You have to scavange everything just so you can buy some potins or pay for a bed to rest. HP and mana dosn't regenerate by it self but you can eat meet, plants, cook your meals, drink potions or go to sleep to replenish it. AND if you think to stop in a midle of a battle to drink potions and heal, oh no sir you can't, enemy dosn't wait for you to drink and eat, he attacks, so it adds to the overal dificulty.But later in game when you build up your levels and skils, max your stats, get some badass equipment then you ar the one who kills in 2-4 blows even the tough of the toughest.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I dont want to reveal much so I dont spoil the experience of discovery, so I didnt mention a lot of stuf in interest of keeping this short and spoiler free.Definitely this is one of those RPG you have to try, just so you can say: Yea, I played that, and it was hard as ****.(even on normal dificulty)TIP 1: save often, quicksave befor any area, or every 5-10 min, and every now and then make a new save just in case you ruin your quicksaveTIP 2: scavange everything, and i mean everything, if you dont need it, you can sell it later for a few coins and buy somthing you need, like potions or food. Since ther is no limit to inventory you dont have to wory about being over packed.To shorten the story:AUDIO/GRAPHICS: 9/10BUGS: 7/10 - it is a litle bugy but nothing you can't live with, some bugs I found in the AI can be exploited to you'r advantage NARATIVE: 9/10DIFFICULTY: it's over 9000FINAL: 9/10			",29,3,1,10,9,0,5

												Man this game was a blast. I had no idea what to expect going into it and after the initial lukewarm first impressions of the intro section I was hooked. The game strikes a very good spot in terms of difficulty where you need to put at least some thought into what stats you're upgrading and the equipment you use, but it never gets too hard or unfair. Even when you've gotten some baller new armour and weapons you never really feel safe against any enemy and fights stay fresh even if they technically are quite repetitive. The combat system itself is slightly clumsy but pretty fun overall, putting big emphasis on dodging or blocking correctly. The world is very friendly towards exploring (being able to climb is awesome) and it rarely feels empty. Just when you get tired of walking long distances the game conveniently introduces its fast travel system. The game never throws that much info at you leaving you to find out what needs to be done yourself which is great. NPCs very often have new things to say and especially in the first half of the game you have a lot of freedom in how you want to complete your objectives. Discovering the game's intricacies never felt like a chore.On the technical side I was a little annoyed by not being able to customise my mouse sensitivity or turn of acceleration. I also had physics bugs when climbing due to high fps, fixable of course but still annoying.Graphically the game is dated and I very highly recommending increasing draw distance. Sadly NPCs and enemies have a very noticable hardcoded distance at which they will pop in, but most everything else you can tweak. Google it. I also installed sweetfx with a custom profile which made a big difference in terms of a sharper and more colourful look.The story? Mostly forgettable, but does its job.Highly recommend it, both for those that like RPGs and those that generally don't.As I liked this game so much, I'm nominating it for the ""I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award"" category in the Steam Awards. autumn of 2016.

												A surprising and potentially buggy hidden gem. You'll either love it or you'll hate it. It's very RPG focused and I personally find the combat fun and just the right difficulty for a 'casual' (I like it easy but not too easy) player like me.			",13,5,0,22,1,0,3

												I recommend this game if it's on a sale.Risen is a very basic RPG game. I mean really basic, you know, if you're hurt, you drink a potion or eat something, your health doesn't regenerate by itself, or your mana. Anything in your inventory doesn't weighs, you can carry 70 two-handed swords, 50 golden platters, 80 golden candlesticks, 92 shields and more but you won't slow down not even a bit. This game has a very basic levelling up and skill system. You know, very basic stats like, strength, dexterity, wisdom, Sword, pickpocket, sneak, bow/crossbow, staff, alchemy etc. If you are new to the RPGs I suggest you to start with this game. If you are into RPGs this game will bore you to death. It has good graphics compared to the time it relased. A good story too. But the game doesn't give you a hint about how to do a quest, in that case you're yourown. You have to find your way till the end. But its a nice game whatsoever, and as I said, buy this game on a sale or if you're new to the RPGs.			",43,3,1,12,7,0,8

												The game offers an atmospheric island with a beautifully designed city and some different landscapes (I really liked the swamp). I have to admit that some of the inhabitants look incestuously similar, but this little deficiency gets perfectly compensated by the fact that all of them have the gift of gap, resulting in humorous and interesting conversations. Although many quests are to get/deliver something to someone, they are well linked into gameplay. The ruins are kind of similar to each other, but (in my opinion) still more diverse than e.g. in Skyrim (although I also liked that game a lot).The final phase of the game unfortunately loses a bit of its charm in comparison to the beginning but, altogether, it was a great game for me.8/10 ",124,41,4,9,14,2,11

												Fun game; but if you buy it, don't get it from steam. The game crashes if you play it on high graphics, and the only fix is a 4gb patch which steam doesn't allow.There are also some bugs worth mentioning, like getting stuck in the air when jumping over some things, and getting stuck in the edge of cliffs when jumping around.bugs can basically be fixed by not jumping in general- but where is the fun in that?

												A very simple Rpg but don't judge it too fast. It has great graphics for a 2009 game with some of the best lighting effects i ever seen in a video game. The exploration is probably the most strong aspect of the game, where you have an island to discover full of intricate paths, atmospheric dungeons, and fascinating creatures. In this aspect and others it may lack the presentation and ambition of the Elder Scrolls games but i felt more immersed in this one than in Skyrim. The way your character develops it's interesting as well, you start off very weak with some ragged clothes as armor and a stick as weapon and because of that you have to think if you want to engage someone in combat, but as you progress through the game and your hero becomes more stronger with better items (and believe me they are hard to get) you feel the sense of development, that your character has changed. The story is nothing of extraordinary as well the characters but it gets the job done.What can i say more about this game? Well a lot more really because it's one of those that there is more than meets the eye.Pick it up, you can get it very cheap nowadays because Risen has been in several bundles.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you play a Piranha Bytes game for the sake of combat then ignore this. But if you want to be a part of an intriguing journey in a land where you are needed the most i belive you will like this! There is alot going on, lots of mystery and things to do to solve this mystery, There is no good or evil path in this game so you can play however you want without having to be forced into the role as a saint or an a-hole. This gives the game great replay value!BUT!...The first half of the game is great, unfortunately the second half is where the developers stopped giving a crap and all you have is one long linear main objective until its finished. I recommend you playing Gothic 3 instead because Risen is basically Gothic 3 light.And beware that the combat in this game is extremely unbalanced, in the beginning you are litteraly worthless and by the end you are unstoppable. I recommend you to to learn the combat before even starting the game if you dont want to rage quit!The combat is god awful, every monster dodge your attacks quicker than a boxing champion and all the humans block and dodge your every attack. Every fight feels like a boxing match where the combat requires patience and timing. I dont have patience, i just want them to die! And there is TOO MUCH COMBAT so that requires ALOT of patience! And when you face multiple enemies you are literally getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			",289,87,6,51,22,2,44

												So this game wasnt exactly what I expected it was somewhat different to the old Gothic matrix that I had assumed it would be. But in the whole it wasnt too bad. It wasnt quite as long as I expected but still quite fun.Pros: - Decent amount of side quests- Decent story- Really nice enviroment (Think this was the bit I enjoyed most about it)- Storyline that matters (I.e your choices matter)Cons:- Multi fight combat is a nightmare at low level and at high level can still be quite challenging.- The learning curve for combat at the beginning is way to high. I found some fights (In particular the Scordo fight) was a total nightmare at the beginning because you had no clue what you were doing still and the enemy can 2 shot you easy.- There is no NPCs (Well besides Patty) which I felt like I could bond with, most of the NPCs felt like part actors rather then actual full actors unlike say Gothic (Xardas, Diego, Gorn, Lee etc etc)- Doesnt feel like putting points in Crossbow/Bow actually does anything (I had 7 in crossbow and it still felt like I was firing at the same speed)So overall i'd give it about a 65% good fun but still nothing compared to Gothic 2.

												First Risen isn't bad, it's even better than Gothic 3 & Arcania, but I was a big fan of Gothic 1 & 2 and for me this game is boring. I liked the atmosphere of the Swamp, but after that I can't force myself to play it.It's a shame that first two Gothic games are very old now, and it's a problem to properly mod it's graphics with an ENB for example. But if you want to play something like that - an atmospheric german openworld RPG, often warm and comfortable like a piece of a fried on a bonfire meat in a small camp in the middle of a hostile, wet swamp - you should give Risen a try.

												I thought the reason I found this game so dull was because it was dated, but then I looked up the release date of TES: Oblivion and found out it was made 3 years before Risen. The combat and animations are terrible and the map is boring to explore, which may be because the world feels like a few linear branching paths and the movement is clunky. The worst animation though is the jumping. The space bar basically makes your caracter bend his legs and glide for 2 seconds. Loading takes 30 seconds off my ssd, ehich for a game this old makes no sense. I want to say something good about the game butI can't, though maybe that's because I have not gotten that far into it. I have leveled up three times but can't seem to distribute any points. In fact I have no idea what leveling up does. Maybe I need to be far enough into the game to get a class. All I have been able to do is find trainers which will improve stats and skills for gold. Keep in mind I have played a good bit of morrowind so I know how to extract value from a game despite the combat controls. I have found this game to be nothing beyond functional.

												Let's start with the fact, that this game reminds me a lot of the third Gothic. Probably because of the game mechanics and engine, but the feeling was nice. I really can't find any good games similar to the Gothic series. Fable was really cool, but the TES series in general is just not my cup of coffee.I've tried Risen three times. Twice it bored me and I stopped after an hour or so, thinking I'll never get back to it. When I finally gave it a chance the third time, I finally got into it. So if you're not convinced at first, I suggest you just keep playing.The game turned out to be really great. The plot is simple but epic, and the mere fact that you have to discover it first as a castaway who knows nothing and is nothing, was something that got me sticked to the screen for hours. So what does this game have that other don't? The unique feeling of progress (just like Gothic). You get to see how powerful your character gets over time, slowly, but once you reach a certain point you know there's hardly anything that may stand in your way. A living world that will feel like home after a while of playing. Freedom to become a warrior, a hunter or a mage. Two ways to follow the plot (as a warrior/hunter or a mage), both leading to the same ending but each with a different line of quests and each with a different backstory/reasons. Before you choose your path you hear from the people what they all think of one and the other. Then you get to choose and, similar to Gothic, you can base your decisions on which you think is good or evil. Lizardmen! Temples!  Amazing music.Bad sides? No hunter game (I've spent hours hunting deer in G3) No sprint (just walking is actually pretty fast but exploring may get a bit boring if you want to see every corner of the island) I invested a lot in crossbows but even with the best crossbow in the game they were pretty useless. Great potential, but feels a bit like it could be used a bit better. It's still a very good game, well made and seems to be a good opening game for a series. I am disappointed with the second game though but I guess I should just give it another chance, like with this one.The second Risen game is generally different. I don't like it (yet?) because I prefer the first, but if you don't like the first you might like the other one. Either way both games are worth checking out, especially if you're a fan of the Gothic series.			",162,59,10,15,12,1,14

												Risen is a single-player fantasy-themed action role-playing game developed by Piranha Bytes. For those familiar, the same developers also created Gothic series. Risen shares quite some similarities with gothic series namely the simplistic yet poignant story, the dialogue which can be humorous at times as well as the prologueThe beauty of Risen which is one of its biggest strengths along with a weakness for some is the difficulty of the game. The protagonist starts extremely weak, no equipment and paper damage making the beginning quite hard. The player will learn quickly the important of quick save and quick load buttons and use them quite often. Using a shield early in the game along with blocking are crucial skills in order to surviveRisen’s story revolves around an Island facing imminent danger and the power struggle between new forces and old ones. The new ones are known as the Inquisition lead by the Inquisitor and the old ones from the island are the bandits led by the Don. The beauty of the game resides in the huge amount of choices you have in the quests. This design gives players choices which would affect them positively or negatively later and it’s an amazing way to immerse them in the world of Risen.In Risen, the player has the traditional level up from gaining experience and completing quests but the beauty comes in the ability to choose what to spend your points on. Unlike most games, you cannot beat some bosses and get rich quick which means that your choice is either to be an impoverished hero or use some of the points you gained to learn skills such as lock picking, skinning and prospecting (mining ores). The player can also use points to train their magic, strength and agility in order to do more damage and gain access to better weapons. This creates an amazing dynamic of choices where you have to decide how important money is versus surviving in-game.Risen also excels when it comes to the graphic part of the game along with the sound effects. The game features a day and night effect too which can be advanced by sleeping and plays a big part in the game. For instance, being outside the city gates at night can be detrimental due to the limited visibility and the need to use a torch in order to see where you are going.The combat in Risen is significantly hard, however it somehow becomes easier in-game after a while in some cases while in other cases it can still be painful. Many enemies have specific patterns when it comes to fighting such as jumping back, animals trying to flank you and humans using their blocking ability to negate damage.  The amazing part is that no matter how strong you get, you can still be killed. Unlike most games the enemies in Risen do not have levels. They are pre-determined from the beginning which makes it hard to start, averagely difficult after a while yet still challenging.Risen is also a long game. After 19 hours, I barely reached Act 2 in the game, and the game has 4 acts.  Keep in mind, I did a lot of side-quests but unlike many other games, Risen requires you to do them in order to get strong else you risk dying even more often. Overall Risen was an excellent experience and a game I would recommend to anyone that enjoys action adventure games. In terms of score it deserves a 9/10 For our popular daily giveaways and similar reviews head over to http://www.steamified.com/To begin your journey through our myriad of social media join our Steam Group			",252,117,9,84,45,2,64

												Probably isn't worth your time and currency. Since the previous games (Gothic 1 and 2) I don't see much improvement(combat, quest\npc mechanics, everything), considering those were made at least in 2002(!) and this one was released in late 2009. In my opinion the design and soundtrack got even worse. There was something a bit canonical in Gothic.But! If you are simply a fan of Gothic and just want to see what Piranha Bytes has been doing(you probably are, just like me), then it's fine. Just don't repeat my mistakes of taking too long, making sure I don't steal too much from NPCs(gotta roleplay as oh-so-ethical hero), playing on hard after I finally got the main magic abilities... And you should especially try to finish the last chapter ASAP, because the lands become empty from your mob farming, the characters lose all the charm, the immersion breaks... and - in my experience - I feel a bit lonely in those moments. With PB games you might as well always drop the last chapter, because at that point usually there's barely any content left.Frost magic was funny. Ice to c u, ecksdee.			",312,55,10,20,28,7,30

												I really tried to like this game. There's a bunch about it to like. The world in which you play was obviously crafted with love. The exploration aspect kept me coming back to play. The variety of enemies and the characters in town were also full of life. Even the story was pretty cool. The world is getting devastated by Titans and the island your on serves as the beginning of humanity's last stand. Cool sign me up.Then comes the combat...As usual, Pirahna Bytes always seems to never be able to try a better system. From Gothic to Risen you'd figure they'd try something new. But, no. It's just a janky mess. The enemies can spam you to death even after leveling your character to godlike levels. Your character can't do more than 1 thing at a time, and it just feels crude and non-responsive. I swear the combat system in these games always makes me wanna tear my hair out. Then the glitches happened. Suddenly getting tossed into the air for no reason (which honestly was more funny than anything)Random crashes. Character suddenly disappears.But probably the one thing that killed me, (Not sure if this was a glitch or not) was the ending. You beat the last boss and you get a 2 minute black screen with some talking. No video, no nice little wrap up. Just a ""ok you did it, bye."" Thanks...no really, thanks for that. I wasn't at all curious as to how my actions influenced the island or nothing. By the way, the intro music sounds suspiciously like the fallout 3 music. Just sayin'All in all, in my opinion, a game has to do a couple of things to get a recommendation. It's gotta look good, play good, and keep my interest. It looks good. It kept my interest. It definitely did not feel good. 2/3 ain't bad though right? You decide if you can deal with that. For me, the love/hate relationship I had with this game makes me say no. For my health I cannot recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Personal rating: 8/10Replayability: MediumBudget: Worth it. Lenght: A few days to a week. I'm not sure what to think of Risen. The company behind Risen made Gothic, a series that I loved. Gothic has a tragic story, funding was cut from the expansion pack to the third installment, resulting in a buggy game that felt unfinished, and had the wrong voice-actors. The dreaded fourth installment that the orginal company wasn't even part of, killed the series, and I hear this is why they started Risen on the side. While I was initially excited about Risen, I feel like Risen is some sort of attempt from the company's side to ""win back"" their original ideas for gothic. It feels like they're trying to make the same game, but different. Still, Risen has a decent story, but Risen is a series, and the third installment just game out. I'll try not to judge Risen 1 on the sequels, but it's hard, because frankly Risen 2 feels like they retconned a lot of Risen 1 in an attempt to reboot their franchise as a sort of ""pirate age"" age game, even though it clearly felt like a high-fantasy gothic medieval game in the first installment. Separately though, the games are quite good, it's just a bit of a snag to get over how poorly they connect, despite several characters making appearances in both games. In many ways, Risen perfectly embodies the spirit of Gothic and does provide some not-seen-before elements. Where in Gothic, you felt like you were the nameless master-mind behind a gang of anti-heroes who follow you out of some misguided sense of loyalty (honor among thieves, I guess) rather than true friendship, always facing challenges in a hostile world as you go about, in Risen you feel like people actually have a more ""human"" relationship towards you. Sure, you're still a nameless guy but apart from a select few individuals, you're truly alone this time, but your friendships in the game are based on actual frienship, meaning the character actually has some relationships with people. Risen in no way beats or threatens the legacy of the 3 real gothic games, but if you liked gothic, you NEED to play Risen too. Fun fact: Many fans believe that unofficially, Risen is set several years in the future of the original gothic trilogy. Read more on this theory on the internet.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good game when playing but, a serious flaw is that on Windows 10 it crashes to a black screen after it runs the first time. Despite trying all the suggestions online the only way round this appears to be to uninstall and the reinstall the whole game every time you want to play; given this takes upwards of 10 minutes it's frustrating. There is no support from the original game makers or Steam. Oh and as I played for 4 hours on my first attempt so no chance of a refund. In summary don't buy it if you have a Windows 10 machine unless you are very patient.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game, better than Oblivion/Skyrim. You start out very weak and even the local wildlife is a very big threat. Combat is enjoyable after you get your first shield and you have to accurately time your attacks in between enemy attacks. The world is big enough to explore but not so large that you get bored wandering around. Only bad thing about the game is there are two major times where they trap you in a town and you can't leave until you've completed certain quests. Would have preferred being able to leave when I wanted to.			",331,75,12,40,25,11,49

												Risen is one of the best RPG games of all time. It has everything you'd want in such type of game. It has great attention to detail, good story, large selection of items. What it lacks is armor choices and weapon choices.. but the game plays in a way that you're not realy bothered about it. This is a must play for people who trully enjoy RPG's and arent too picky about graphics.. Afterall, this was named as the successor of the first Gothic series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a more realistic version of Skyrim.  Combat is less hack-and-slash, requiring actual strategy instead.  Pickpocketing makes more sense, as does sneaking and lockpicking.  The stat system is slightly more similar to D&D, without being too complicated.  I would recommend it very highly.			",203,32,0,38,17,2,18

												I like this game, the game play style seperates it from something like Skyrim. It has a refreshing style of realistic envrionment where creatures don't respawn only new creatures get added per chapter. The items/xp is limited in the game so it makes you think about character progression. Overall I enjoy this game, with the exception of the jumping bug where I have to force v-sync to be enabled.

												First things first Risen is a great game, you can literaly spend countless hours on playthrough, this game is very similar to Gothic. You are starting at the bottom, slowly climbing to the top with one of the fractions. Meanwhile in main story you can take a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of side quests and explore the world. I've never played game where the exploring world was so rewarding. Dialogs are good, english dub is good aswell, gameplay is bit glitchy (Enemies can hit you even if there is their ally in front of them, they just cut him trough and hit you..) I got stuck in textures countless times so I recommend you to SAVE A LOT. First two chapters are amazing, the rest is just Ok. I personally had fun while playing Risen so If you love Gothic give it a shot.6.5/10 ",156,76,1,46,15,1,11

												It's good.This is a third-person RPG scavenger game. The reason I only have 2hrs listed is because this game was in a package deal and I got a refund because the others weren't working right. I got this game on disc when it first came out.There's only a limit to the stuff you can fight and find in game. So if you run around like a hardhead you'll find yourself hard pressed late game. Getting your hunting skill up before kill animals so you get more stuff to sell, not using certain herbs til you can make the best potions from them and other thing must be taken into account. I needed to start over because of this.You have two main choices in the game. This will efect somethings you'll get or lose. Access to the other camp which making them enimies. You  have other choices you can make as well like what will your guy be? Fighter, wizard or theif. You'll be able to  get what you need with some running around and planning.From the little bit I've play the game seems to be the same. Some games are dumbed down and/or made easy. Which if true which means I can recommand it to those gamers who don't like easy games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have to say I was one of those people that started up the game and quit after 10 minutes. I did the same with Risen 2. But eventually curiosity got the better of me and I returned to play Risen out of the blue a year later and I was instantly hooked. I usually hop between games when I play as I get bored easily but Risen was different. I blazed through the game and enjoyed it very much so. It does have its bugs and some difficult combat but its old school hardcore rpg gameplay is great. *******SPOILER!!!!******** that ending though *****SPOILER******			",128,23,4,16,5,2,17

Storywise, I'm not gonna spoil but I'm just going to say that the ending felt kind of dull for me, the boss fight was amazing though, I give this game 8 out of 10, I really recommend it.

												After the technical disasters of Gothic 3, Piranha Bytes have returned to form with Risen. Risen feels a lot similar to their original Gothic 1 masterpiece, but a bit more modern in many regards. The world itself is much smaller [than Gothic 3], but much more interesting - especially in terms of questing & with what's going on in the world. Typical of PB's RPG's, the world is breathing & living - it is very immersive; NPC's run on a schedule; & the world has a high level of interactivity. Also like most PB RPG's, the combat is still somewhat clunky & pales in comparison to other RPG's. Your decisions do matter in the actual story itself & will shape your Nameless Character and his skills. Some of the best stuff in the game is some of the side-quests, focusing on the theme of pirates. While Gothic 1 is PB's true masterpiece, Risen is a close second or third for them & a major step in the right direction in many ways. If you like RPG's, you do owe it to yourself to play Risen.Grade = B.			",894,314,36,138,76,13,111

												Risen is what I call a spiritual successor to the Gothic Series, more specifically Gothic 1 which the developers had previously lost the rights to before regaining them shortly after the release of Risen 2. Risen is by all rights an HD version of everything that was good about Gothic. The small map that seems daunting but becomes akin to the back of your hand after a few hours of exploration, tons of dense forestry with ruins to explore, and a relatively interesting story concept of humans banishing the gods and titans rising to take their place for dominance and destroy the humans.Overall there is nothing that can be said is explicitly bad about Risen, there are some changes/complaints which I'll list but otherwise was nothing worth dismissing this game from being playable. I know there are plenty of people who complained about the 'old-fashionedness' which I can see nothing of in my playthrough. If you liked any of Gothic, you'll simply fall in love with Risen, the atmosphere is great with everything that I had liked about Gothic. Sadly I felt that the humor was a tad off from the Gothic days were I found every quip to bring a half-smile to my face no matter how corny. In Risen many of the jokes/quips are short one liners that simply don't hit the same mark for some reason, and it's hard to pinpoint why that is.Unlike Gothic 1, Risen decided to narrow the choices for the player with only including two different camps for the player to choose from with the Volcano Keep vs the Bandit Camp while Gothic had the Old Camp, New Camp, and the Swamp. It oftentimes feels as though Risen was originally going to have three divisions like Gothic but was changed to only have two instead, possibly because of compact the island was and how strange it would be to have three factions vying for control over the island. This was something I felt that Gothic had an issue with as the Old Camp was virtually non-existent until nearly the end of the game, which I think would have been the case if Harbortown was a seperate entity in Risen. My point is that in Gothic 1 both the Swamp and New Camp were interesting and everyone involved seemed to be pleasant which inticed you into a conflict of which faction to join. In Risen you have the Bandit Camp full of absolute dirtbags with the exception of the Smith and one or two other characters or the Volcano Keep where you get walloped until you join their faction unwillingly. Quite frankly I found myself hating both sides and often swindling whoever I could whenever possible.Portal Stones were an addition to the game not unusual from the Gothic Franchise and while the original Gothic had only three stones; each for a differing capitol, Risen rose above to a grand total of 14 teleport stones. The only issue I have with the stones is that it spawns lizards that hold the stones in a wide variety of places that the player has quite likely already been, resulting in missing stones with no quest map to avail their needs. Furthermore these stones are often too close together and not far enough apart, some regions of the map have no teleport stone to have easy access to the area without running around or inside a mountain. This brings me into the map issue where while the map is densly packed with things to do there are certain regions that are used marginally once, and never set upon again. This is also addressed in my various complaints log where I state that the search is often left undone as the best stuff in the game is generally handed out to the player in plain sight with very few hidden goodies to treasure. The Berserker Sword for example is in one of the five endgame dungeons but can be accessed before even that chapter, as early as chapter 1 and is easily one of THE BEST WEAPONS in the game. Now various complaints-Traits or skill trees were worthless for the most part, sword/axe trees were only useful to equip 2h weapons with 1h, which means that attributes give far more weight-Dexterity items were extremely lacking and it's disappointing that they put only ranged weapons in the grouping which were almost worthlessTo me the sword skill should have grown off dexterity with dex having bows and swords - str having axes and crossbows - intel having staves and magic.-Blacksmithing level 3 was absolutely worthless with many weapons easily outdoing any craftable weapon, only level 2 was worthwhile with Goldsmithing-Acrobatics, Sneaking, Alchemy, Prospecting, and Gutting Animals were all absolutely mandatory and it seems weird that these were optional choices.In that note Prospecting became worthless quickly after gaining the amount of gold you need and finding the jewelry you want. I collected well over 99 iron ore and obsidian ore with nothing of worth to create.Alchemy allows you to create 'additional' permanent stat points but the game fails to explain that you can't level stats with learning points past 100 of any attribute which tricks players into using potions or stat increases before they hit the 100 mark when they could go up to 200 of any attribute. Additional stats in my opinion should have been a seperate variable that adds onto the characters base stats.-When training skills if a ring is equipped that upgrades the skill you actually pay for the level ABOVE what skill you actually have.-Odd game mechanics coming into play at the very end of the game forcing the player to press the same switch to open different doors which was never implemented earlier (literally in the last dungeon-More about the final dungeon; there is an area that doesn't allow the player to use magics because the player could levitate over the gap and get stuck behind an immovable stone door. This was likely done to prevent players from getting stuck since it probably happened A LOT during the beta test of the game. It's extremely silly you can't use magic in only this location and made me fall to my death in areas located AROUND this location making me fall out of levitate for no reason until I got lower in the dungeon and found out why it was happening. Overall it was cheaply done to route the problem they were having instead of quickly designing a quick side path to let players escape, even a small hole could have supplemented with the transform snail spell.-Often warped up to the top of different buildings when walking INTO the building-Enemies would warp to a position around the player for some reason, especially annoying if you would get your enemy into a position to combo him easily to only have him warp around your character and combo you instead.-Combat was rough, and the lockon system often felt off. Sadly this game doesn't do multiple enemy combat very well which there is A LOT of.-Combat being Rough: Due to the jerkiness of the jump/dodge key which would terrorize combat with you being unalbe to jump back if a pebble or small incline was in your path.-Sometimes attacks would just phase through enemies can't even explain this one-Enemies jump back WAY TOO preemptively it gets really annoying and oftentimes you just have to force an enemy into a corner to stop them from jumping back-No merchant talent which I thought would be insanely useful to increase sale prices, since you will only get 1/20 of the worth of any item you sell.-Last boss was silly but I think most of the final bosses have always been silly for Piranha Bytes-Quest Map was a seperate map instead of overlaying the Map UI when clicking on a quest, I have no idea why these two were made independently.-Lack of 'dungeons' to explore, with final quest throwing 5 dungeons all at once that makes you hate everything about them. Think Oblivion and closing the 8 gates in a row, it just sucks doing it all at once.-Tons of secret areas but are rarely worth finding them, oftentimes used a spell like levitate to find 40 coins which isn't even worth the cost of the spell.etc...

												If you're a fan of European RPGs that don't take you by the hand and drag you along a narrow path, but still isn't as riddled with bugs as the greatest or termite mounds... then look no further!Risen presents a lush, atmospheric and highly vivid world, that is full of charm.Piranha Bytes, the developer behind the three first three Gothic-games, successfully captures the spirit of their former works, while improving it in almost every way. Risen is definitely the spiritual successor to Gothic 1-3. Forget Arcania: ""Gothic 4"", RISEN is where it's at.... and if Risen 2 turns out to be what Gothic 2 was for Gothic 1.... then lo and behold, the RPG of the ages will have arrived.

												A hidden gem of the Steam Store. A very nice, semi-traditional RPG with real-time combat. The setting isn't anything fancy or new, and the characters are mostly forgetable, but it's fun to explore the big world and grow your character. It can be game-breakingly glitchy at times, though, and it doesn't bring much innovation to the table as a game. I would say 6.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great underrated rpg.The gameplay is different from other RPGs such as The Elder Scrolls, Not everyone may like it.The game can be really confusing sometimes, the quests, the map, pretty much everything but the game itself is really awesome, It's different from the other RPGs which is a plus.Just 2 things I do not like which are the freeroam and the ending.Do not except  The Elder Scrolls or even a Fallout game, it's open world but at the same time it's linear.You cannot continue after the ending, not even a new game plus.Those are 2 big flaws that are common in the games made by Piranha – Bytes.For some, it could be positive but for a gamer like me, they are both flaws.It's pretty much the same for every Gothic and Risen games, just that some have a better story, gameplay, items etc than the others.If it was truly open world with unlimited freeroam and we would be able to continue playing after the end, I would probably give it a 9/10 but since it is not the case I'm giving it a 7.5/10My personal favorite list (from the best to the worse and worse doesn't means bad, just not the greatest of those two series):1. Gothic II2. Gothic3. Risen4. Gothic III5. Risen 2: Dark Water6. Arcania: Gothic 47. Risen IIIThey are all good In my opinion, but some are more worth than the others, of course, they all have their good points and their flaws.All they need is more freedom, infinite random encounters and to be able to play after the end of the game.Random encounters would be great for the replay ability since once you're done with the game, you're done, either you start a new game and start from scratch or play another game which is kind of sad because I love to play with my end game character.Enemies respawn would be a great addition to the Gothic and Risen series in my opinion, if done right, it would bring a lot of replay ability.7.5/10			",972,203,71,193,128,3,223

												Played this game, loved it after playing for an hour, got hooked up and couldn't let go of it until I finished.This game's playability is truly amazing despite being small in size, and kind of long indeed, never felt so attached to a game after I played Fable: TLC, the paths given in this game are something that I really loved, early game the game is hard as f*ck, the difficulty reduces as you play through the game. Storywise, I'm not gonna spoil but I'm just going to say that the ending felt kind of dull for me, the boss fight was amazing though, I give this game 8 out of 10, I really recommend it.

												Fun rpg, combat is sometimes annoying and the voice acting occasionally feels subpar, but the island is interesting and open to exploration, there are a number of great quests and the puzzles have just the right degree of difficulty. Risen is fairly long, took me ~50 hours for a full playthrough, even if you skipped some sidequests it will probably still take at least 30 hours. If you like rpgs and have played through the great ones already I recommend Risen for a good time.			",963,469,25,146,64,6,142

												I don't say do not play it! Acually quite the opposite - give it a try, I did not enjoy the sorroundings, climate and entire concept. It's way to similar to Night of the Raven add on to Gothic 2. I know NotR was a success; shiit - a big succes for JooWood and Pirania Bytes but what they did is they just simply coppied the entire concept. Of the NotR to Risen and then started to create a game, NOT from the draft. As I did not enjoy Night of the Raven I didn't enjoy Risen very much. Even though all I did was come from the beach to the City and did a few quests I can already tell I'm really not into it. I might give it a try when I'm super bored but for now I have to try Risen 2 and Risen 3. GRAPHICS - 6/10 - let's say it's well enough for 2009, and enough in terms of graphics/open world-ness.MUSIC - 7/10 - I guess it kinda stays in the climateCONTENT - -/10 - no ideaGAMEPLAY - for ME [only] 2/10 - worst two hours of my life, but give it a try. It gets '2' and not '1' only for one good joke. LET ME KNOW if I should force myself to play, does it get any better?			",34,7,1,16,6,0,14

												Risen is what I call a spiritual successor to the Gothic Series, more specifically Gothic 1 which the developers had previously lost the rights to before regaining them shortly after the release of Risen 2. Risen is by all rights an HD version of everything that was good about Gothic. The small map that seems daunting but becomes akin to the back of your hand after a few hours of exploration, tons of dense forestry with ruins to explore, and a relatively interesting story concept of humans banishing the gods and titans rising to take their place for dominance and destroy the humans.Overall there is nothing that can be said is explicitly bad about Risen, there are some changes/complaints which I'll list but otherwise was nothing worth dismissing this game from being playable. I know there are plenty of people who complained about the 'old-fashionedness' which I can see nothing of in my playthrough. If you liked any of Gothic, you'll simply fall in love with Risen, the atmosphere is great with everything that I had liked about Gothic. Sadly I felt that the humor was a tad off from the Gothic days were I found every quip to bring a half-smile to my face no matter how corny. In Risen many of the jokes/quips are short one liners that simply don't hit the same mark for some reason, and it's hard to pinpoint why that is.Unlike Gothic 1, Risen decided to narrow the choices for the player with only including two different camps for the player to choose from with the Volcano Keep vs the Bandit Camp while Gothic had the Old Camp, New Camp, and the Swamp. It oftentimes feels as though Risen was originally going to have three divisions like Gothic but was changed to only have two instead, possibly because of compact the island was and how strange it would be to have three factions vying for control over the island. This was something I felt that Gothic had an issue with as the Old Camp was virtually non-existent until nearly the end of the game, which I think would have been the case if Harbortown was a seperate entity in Risen. My point is that in Gothic 1 both the Swamp and New Camp were interesting and everyone involved seemed to be pleasant which inticed you into a conflict of which faction to join. In Risen you have the Bandit Camp full of absolute dirtbags with the exception of the Smith and one or two other characters or the Volcano Keep where you get walloped until you join their faction unwillingly. Quite frankly I found myself hating both sides and often swindling whoever I could whenever possible.Portal Stones were an addition to the game not unusual from the Gothic Franchise and while the original Gothic had only three stones; each for a differing capitol, Risen rose above to a grand total of 14 teleport stones. The only issue I have with the stones is that it spawns lizards that hold the stones in a wide variety of places that the player has quite likely already been, resulting in missing stones with no quest map to avail their needs. Furthermore these stones are often too close together and not far enough apart, some regions of the map have no teleport stone to have easy access to the area without running around or inside a mountain. This brings me into the map issue where while the map is densly packed with things to do there are certain regions that are used marginally once, and never set upon again. This is also addressed in my various complaints log where I state that the search is often left undone as the best stuff in the game is generally handed out to the player in plain sight with very few hidden goodies to treasure. The Berserker Sword for example is in one of the five endgame dungeons but can be accessed before even that chapter, as early as chapter 1 and is easily one of THE BEST WEAPONS in the game. Now various complaints-Traits or skill trees were worthless for the most part, sword/axe trees were only useful to equip 2h weapons with 1h, which means that attributes give far more weight-Dexterity items were extremely lacking and it's disappointing that they put only ranged weapons in the grouping which were almost worthlessTo me the sword skill should have grown off dexterity with dex having bows and swords - str having axes and crossbows - intel having staves and magic.-Blacksmithing level 3 was absolutely worthless with many weapons easily outdoing any craftable weapon, only level 2 was worthwhile with Goldsmithing-Acrobatics, Sneaking, Alchemy, Prospecting, and Gutting Animals were all absolutely mandatory and it seems weird that these were optional choices.In that note Prospecting became worthless quickly after gaining the amount of gold you need and finding the jewelry you want. I collected well over 99 iron ore and obsidian ore with nothing of worth to create.Alchemy allows you to create 'additional' permanent stat points but the game fails to explain that you can't level stats with learning points past 100 of any attribute which tricks players into using potions or stat increases before they hit the 100 mark when they could go up to 200 of any attribute. Additional stats in my opinion should have been a seperate variable that adds onto the characters base stats.-When training skills if a ring is equipped that upgrades the skill you actually pay for the level ABOVE what skill you actually have.-Odd game mechanics coming into play at the very end of the game forcing the player to press the same switch to open different doors which was never implemented earlier (literally in the last dungeon-More about the final dungeon; there is an area that doesn't allow the player to use magics because the player could levitate over the gap and get stuck behind an immovable stone door. This was likely done to prevent players from getting stuck since it probably happened A LOT during the beta test of the game. It's extremely silly you can't use magic in only this location and made me fall to my death in areas located AROUND this location making me fall out of levitate for no reason until I got lower in the dungeon and found out why it was happening. Overall it was cheaply done to route the problem they were having instead of quickly designing a quick side path to let players escape, even a small hole could have supplemented with the transform snail spell.-Often warped up to the top of different buildings when walking INTO the building-Enemies would warp to a position around the player for some reason, especially annoying if you would get your enemy into a position to combo him easily to only have him warp around your character and combo you instead.-Combat was rough, and the lockon system often felt off. Sadly this game doesn't do multiple enemy combat very well which there is A LOT of.-Combat being Rough: Due to the jerkiness of the jump/dodge key which would terrorize combat with you being unalbe to jump back if a pebble or small incline was in your path.-Sometimes attacks would just phase through enemies can't even explain this one-Enemies jump back WAY TOO preemptively it gets really annoying and oftentimes you just have to force an enemy into a corner to stop them from jumping back-No merchant talent which I thought would be insanely useful to increase sale prices, since you will only get 1/20 of the worth of any item you sell.-Last boss was silly but I think most of the final bosses have always been silly for Piranha Bytes-Quest Map was a seperate map instead of overlaying the Map UI when clicking on a quest, I have no idea why these two were made independently.-Lack of 'dungeons' to explore, with final quest throwing 5 dungeons all at once that makes you hate everything about them. Think Oblivion and closing the 8 gates in a row, it just sucks doing it all at once.-Tons of secret areas but are rarely worth finding them, oftentimes used a spell like levitate to find 40 coins which isn't even worth the cost of the spell.etc...

												Recommended for lovers of the old Gothic games who want to see the series' story continue!It's the old ""Gothic"" in a new cloth - or rather a barely hidden sequel in the old cloth. It looks like the old games, it plays like the old games and there's so many ingame references to what happended in the old games, even if it's never said explicitly (mostly for legal reasons): Again you have two factions (one in the swamp, one in the city - sounds familar?), and you can do missions for both sides before reaching a descision point. Neither side is really good, and both focus on different abilities. And again - in the end your decision doesn't matter too much, apart from defining the abilities your character can learn. You stilll only get new armor by advancing within the factions, and you still have to pay trainers to convert your skill points into actual skills...Still, after the fiasco of Gothic 3, it is also a return to the good (if you liked the formula) old Gothic atmosphere and story telling. If you enjoyed Gothic and Gothic 2 (which were absolutely great for their time), then this might be the game for you - just ignore the third Gothic and imagine that the unnamed hero and the wizzard (iirc Thardas?) from the first games together killed of the gods and thereby freed the titans that now threaten to kill of all of humanity. The storyline of Risen  and its sequels starts there - with a new unnamed hero beached on a mysterious island that is somehow still safe from the titans. And of course you will discover the reason behind that and unwillingly aid in compromising the safety of the island. Which you will then have to rectify. Not a very inventive story, but well told, with the roughness and shades of gray that is typical for the Gothic series. No one is really good (not even you) and no one is absolutely evil either.Technologically it's quite dated and really just the old Gothic 3 engine with a new setting. Not too bad for it's time, but every third character has the same face, and just wears a different name and uniform. It's fun to play, though only for people who really loved the old games. By now it's also stable to play, something Piranha Bytes never manage on release.As said at the beginning: if you liked Gothic and Gothic II you will probably enjoy this very much, if not, the rather have a look at Risen 2 and 3 which continue the story with a more pirat-like setting. These are more modern games that keep much of what defined the Gothic series, but with much improved technology, a more varied setting (several islands to explore) and a better story. Just don't expect a pirates in the Caribean swashbuckling adventure -  the Risen series stays true to the Gothic RPGs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Loved it. Was very fun and challenging. Whole story took around 24-30 hours, searching everything. Was fun, too bad Risen 2 turned it into a pirate game... still don't know how I feel about that due to this one feeling more like a traditional RPG.			",24,2,0,15,8,0,10

												I've only played about an hour of the beginning of this game, but it's pretty fun. I will definitely be playing more. If you'd like to see the first bit of the game you can check out my video here:

												I try to love this game. Yet I just can't.I had already played it some, the leave it right after exiting the game. But, after noticing the sequels for Risen, inevitably I told myself,  Maybe the story is good, since it spawned up two sequels.  So I gave the game another try, searching for  any  redeemable quality.I have to say I really like the alchemy system, smithing, and how the game make use of magic. Creating scrolls yourself and whatnot. It is a hassle, but a rewarding one. I like it how you can use a 'Joke' spell to make up with a character you previously angered. That's about it, I guess.Moving on. Halfway inside the main quest, I sighed in despair. Realizing that I don't even  care for the Main Character  for me to start caring for any its secondary characters. And that's a huge flaw, considering I play RPGs for its main content: the storyline and a good vast of characters to help strengthen it. Though some RPGs are lacking in story, they backed it up with an amazing combat system, for instance. Or its huge amounts of loots. Risen lacks both.So, unless you're a die hard of fan of RPGs, with sole purpose in life to play every RPGs out there is in the face of the earth, give it a try. But I can't recommend it in full price.But I'm only a voice, telling my own experience with the game.And then is heard no more; it is a taleTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,Signifying nothing.

												It's a decent RPG in my opinion that follows the steps of it's predecessor, Gothic. And it does it pretty well. If you didn't get it on Humble Bundle, wait for a sale and play it right away. You won't be dissapointed!Things that I like: -good voice acting, a few cool and funny characters, as well as dialogues;-the monsters and creatures respawn; (triggered by certain things like new chapter etc. )-armor is very rare; it's expensive and you can only get it from joining factions. That makes you feel somewhat powerful and it's more rewarding this way;-pickpocketing is fun; (you can even steal items in use :D)-unlimited inventory, no carrying weight-leveling up and spending learning points is highly rewarding and satisfying-simplistic and cool UIThings I don't like: -the combat and it's animations are pretty clunky and it's kinda hard to excell at it-lockpicking involves luck, not real 'skill'. Locks are not random and you can abuse this pretty easy with a quicksave. I'm not really complaining about this, but it could've been better.-occasional bugs-lacks of minimap. I used to have a compass on my screen but that dissapeared somehow.Others: -You can fast travel only when you get to chapter 2. There are 14 teleporting stones and you need to find them so you can be able to use them.-you are going to spend most of your time walking, quicksaving, dying and quickloading			",234,55,7,25,25,4,31

 Failed expectations I really love Gothic series, so my expectations concerning Risen were very high. And for about 15 hours of the game everything was 'about' right. But the rest - boring, tedious at times, especially after chapter 2. I will try to explain why:- Story. Of course Gothic wasn't perfect by any means in this regard, but Risen is way worse. I don't want to give spoilers here, but i felt as if I were doing one big Fedex quest, which was lame and uninteresting. Maybe studio ran out of ideas and had to make something generic...- There's nothing much to do after ch 2. Befeore starting ch3 you can easily complete nearly every side quest in this game, leaving you almost nothing after then (apart from main plot). In both GI and GII it was completely opposite, world was changing and giving you new challenges.- City is totally dull. After you complete quests in ch1, there is rarely a reason to go back there. And city itself is minimal version of Khorinis.- NPC are uninteresting. There are mainly just a quest givers, without a flavour to them. Compare this to wide range o Gothic characters...- Chapter 4, with all this tomb raiding and boring (like designed for mobile devices) boss battle is a fatal end to end this game.Really, in the beginning I was (positively) shocked - ""Hey, it's good pold game again' feeling. But as I mentioned, the rest was getting worse the more passed. I played for nearly 40 h, but it took me about 6 weeks to end this. Normally it would be two.There are pros of course:- Graphics is very good- Interface is better thought than in previous PB games- Combat system seems to be better- It made me want to play original Gothic againIt is by no means a bad game, far from it, but for series lovers it can be a let down - for me it was, so I can't really recommend it.

												To say I regret the time I spent playing Risen would be like saying the holocaust was a little unfortunate. If ever a game was created to frustrate and punish (not by way of skill cap) an rpg lover, it would be this game. Risen has all the appeal of dating a toothless Little Debbie taste tester without the great bjs or free snacks.  It boasts so many cool concepts and executes on NONE of them.  Easily one of the ugliest least enjoyable Rpgs I have ever played.	Making a list of pros for this game is next to impossible;  maybe the interesting creatures in the world could be appealing to some, but definitely not when weighed with all the filth this game manages to churn out.  The combat is complete trash, you button mash for melee and god forbid you try to use ranged.  No reticle unless you zoom and the zoom takes 2 seconds to focus. Now try to get a shot off while groups of melee  enemies rush your face.  Basically the only ranged strats consist of shooting before in combat and switching to melee (O don't switch weapons while zoomed cause it will stay there and u will have to manually zoom back out...derp) or breaking the stupid AI by diagonally strafing into enemies and shooting them when their character models begin turning.	The AI is laughable and insanely easy to take advantage of,  Running a group of enemies over tree roots and getting them stuck allows them to be easily picked off.  And again since most enemies are melee it makes it that much easier.  Enemies have one attack pattern that never changes, charge into you and do 1 of their often times 2 possible combos.  The game tries to mask this huge failure by making the difficulty extremely high.  If you're playing on hard enemies will kill you in a couple attacks.  Im perfectly fine with a game having a high difficulty curve...If it's fun (Dark souls).  This game is not fun at all.	While the game says it has character customization and varying skill paths it basically boils down to being a bandit or a mage both of which have as much depth as a mud puddle in July.  Much like the skills, the quests have different ways of completion that would appear to have morale consequences tied to them but in the end its essentially more gold for making the ""correct"" decision and even if you completely screw over the npcs related to the quest  and they say they hate you, they will still interact with you the same way. The quests reminded me of an MMO, a whole lot of fetch and kill quests with almost no substance; given by countless npcs you will never care about.  Every npc has the same melancholy tone and you will remember none of them, much like your own character.  You can literally go into a town, find someone in their house, beat them till their health is gone, loot all their items, wait for them to get up and beat you to death (you dont die) and get up and keep everything.  Rinse and repeat. Such a well coded game.    	The world is open for each map and you're free to explore as you like, likewise with quests you can pick the order of completion for many outside of crucial story quests.  This is a wonderful model for an rpg to have, unfortunately for this game the maps are bland and almost always dark.  There was no place I visited during my playtime that was memorable and quite frankly the game is ugly, like early original xbox ugly.  It's only fair to note that I never actually beat the game even though that was my primary goal.  So it is possible that the quests might have started to pick up and became somewhat interesting, but this in no way excuses the snore-fest that was the first part of the game.	So we have an ugly role playing game with terrible AI, boring combat, forgettable quests and a depressing cast of characters that only reflect how you will feel inside after you start playing.  The only way I would ever recommend this game is if it was at least 85% off and you have played almost every other rpg on steam. Piranha Bytes really dropped the ball on this one.  3/10 for this walking steamer.			",114,11,0,39,0,0,5

												There's not much to be said about this game that hasn't been said before. It's a true sequel to the Gothic series in all but name.The story is ridiculous nonsense but serviceable, the graphics are little more than decent and it's got a few bugs here and there.On the other hand there are TONS of things to do, factions to choose from, items to forge, herbs to gather, potions to mix, animals to skin. It's rough but it's endearing and definitely worth playing.			",290,103,24,48,26,3,35

												This game is everything Gothic would have been if it were released fifteen years later. I recommed it to whoever enjoys the adventure/fps-combination and want a bit more challenge to the fights than pumping attack key. The game tells you to save often, and in truth you should do it after every battle; if you get caught with your pants down, it's all over in seconds.Graphics and audio is very good, even if my machine gets overheated quick on 2880x1620. Thankfully the game looks very good at lower resolutions, and I haven't had any game crashes so far in about 20 hours played.I'm using an ASUS laptop, i7 @2,20 GHz, 8 Gb RAM, SSD disk, Windows 8.1			",21,20,0,10,3,0,2

												I didn˙t heard much of  this game before I played it, however I have to say that it`s really worth the time. It has a very long storyline, with wide side-mission list. The combat sometimes can be buggy, and annoying, but once you get into it, it's not a big deal.     The ability to choose between factions is great, however I only played it through once, so I don't know how much difference does it have between the playthroughs. The skills are mostly done right, you can't be in all role in the game, however I think that playing as a swordsmen is much more difficult like as an archer, or mage.I'd give the game a total of 8/10, so I think it's really worth a shot. You can get dozens of hours into it, and if you're a fan of RPG-s, you possibly won't be disappointed, if you don't take a faults of game too seriously.			",166,22,4,16,13,1,37

												I can't seem to get this game to run properly.  I notice most people do not have this problem and seem to love the game, so perhaps I have THE ONE THING on my machine that it isn't compatible with, or something.I spent hours attempting to solve a flicker problem occurring every time lightning struck (which is about every half-second when the game starts), and an associated striping problem, and managed to get it reduced, but not eliminated.  I won't go into what all I did, because there appears to be a 99% chance, or better, that you won't have that issue.  I figured, at this point, that I would just play through and try to get to a non-lightning scene.  Then my first conversation froze up, and I just gave up.With the monstrous number of games I have on Steam, it will already take me about 10 years to play them all, so I'm just not going to spend this much time trying to fix this one.  I was considering buying the other two Risen games (they're on sale this week for reeeeeallly good prices), but I'm going to assume the same team made all three and just NOT.  For all you people who do get to play, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.  :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You are a castaway. You wake up on an island loaded with evil temples and mutant animals, where everyone is addicted to drugs and alcohol, AIDS is rampant, and the vast majority of people speak in an English accent accompanied by expletives.Pros:- Great combat system- Good map structure- Intriguing questsCons:- Animations are sub-par- Immersion-ruining and rather excessive adult content (cursing, drugs and alcohol)- Mega-load of sexual content- No tutorial- Savescumming should be expected every step along the way     I admit that cursing can add to the intensity of a situation provided it's done at the right time, but there is excessive swearing in this game to the point of being irritating. See that pirate guy in the jail? Be prepared for him to say the F-word three times within two sentences.      As with cursing, drugs and alcohol are displayed in excess. Practically everyone either smokes or drinks. Finally, was it really necessary to put a brothel in the game, let alone right in the middle of the starter town?This really could have been a great game for me, but it was ruined by the buildup of these small annoyances.

												Warning: this game is very buggy. The worst bug is the fact that when you try to jump onto something, there's a 50% chance that you'll jump right into purgatory instead of the platform, so it's imperative that you save before every jump. However, the gameplay and the fact that quick saves are...quick redeems it. Another warning: this game is very difficult at the lower levels. You'll find yourself quick saving multiple times in a single combat because you have to hit that wolf 20 times while it only has to hit you 3 times to kill you. Anyway, those are my major complaints and the rest of the game is brilliant.			",74,23,0,6,1,0,1

												I can't seem to get this game to run properly.  I notice most people do not have this problem and seem to love the game, so perhaps I have THE ONE THING on my machine that it isn't compatible with, or something.I spent hours attempting to solve a flicker problem occurring every time lightning struck (which is about every half-second when the game starts), and an associated striping problem, and managed to get it reduced, but not eliminated.  I won't go into what all I did, because there appears to be a 99% chance, or better, that you won't have that issue.  I figured, at this point, that I would just play through and try to get to a non-lightning scene.  Then my first conversation froze up, and I just gave up.With the monstrous number of games I have on Steam, it will already take me about 10 years to play them all, so I'm just not going to spend this much time trying to fix this one.  I was considering buying the other two Risen games (they're on sale this week for reeeeeallly good prices), but I'm going to assume the same team made all three and just NOT.  For all you people who do get to play, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.  :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game on sale and am glad I did. I then played through it out of obligation. The game has no balance. On the standard normal mode combat is next to impossible and you will find yourself saving after every battle just so you don't have to redo it WHEN you die. Difficult combat would not be a bad thing, except its the driving force behind the game, almost everyquest has some sort of combat in it. I could continue to rant on the broken combat system talking about how counters require inhuman timing or how every enemy is able to attack faster then you, or how controls don't respond and you find yourself stuck in a six attack combo when you wanted to block, but I feel like you get the point. Other aspects of the game such as the map and quest log are there but simple don't work 100% of the time (I've gotten them to work maybe twice).Fear not there are some positives. First the game doesn't not look like complete garbage, no character customization, but the overall look of the game is moderatley appealing. Remember how I mentioned saving after every battle, well you can save anywhere, anytime (Even in the middle of a really annoying boss fight). The story is fairly intersting and about the only thing that has kept my interest in the game. For those who want a mental challenge many quests have a puzzle aspect to them.Overall the game would be fine if it didn't rely so heavily on a broken combat system.Side note: There is an entire main quest dedicated to becoming a pot dealer (best drug dealing simulator NA)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: April 23, 2014
												Risen is an action role playing game in which you the player are pitted against the horrifying enemy of the game's controls and interface. The majority of the game's problems stem from the poorly handled camera. Locked in third person perspective, the camera is drawn as an evironment object. This results in the camera catching on terrain geometry and causing all sorts of havoc with movement and combat. One minute you may be facing an opponent and the next a wall, as you back through a doorway or past a column. The combat system is exceptionally poor. When facing an enemy, the camera snaps to target (a ""feature"" with no way to disable it). This doesn't work even with a single target, as mobs will frequently run around you, the snap breaks as you turn to follow, or the mobs dodge through your character due to some sort of bug or allowance for model collision strictly for mobs to do so. This turns fighting multiple opponents into a nightmare of camera jerks, lost targets, easy flanks and hits by the enemy against you. Apart from the camera, the combat itself is frustrating and poorly implemented. In Risen, combat is handled through Attack, Parry, and Block functions via the left and right button only. Yes, parry and block are tied into the same mouse button and vary only by press vs click. This, with the slow interface, results in an awkward jumbled dance of trying to time your parry against enemy attacks (when they can be parried) and trying to maintain blocking (against enemy attacks which can't be parried). This combined with the variance in mob attack speeds (from slow as hell to instant) results in you either missing your parry (while knowing the enemy is going to attack) and getting hit because your character is too slow to (this is due to canned animations) or parrying wildly against nothing because you misjudged when a mob was actually going to swing.Fortunately this combat can almost entirely be disregarded as ranged combat weapons and kiting are the most effective form of combat, provided you have the space to manuever and weapons powerful enough to harm your opponents. Unfortunately, ammunation is scarce and will result in you running between vendors hoping to find more ammo. Fortunately mobs on the island only respawn when certain plot progression triggers are met, meaning you can clear the entirety of the game out in due course. This is of course a poor attempt and lengthining the game artificially, as you will be required to clear out areas once again as new quests become available, making it far longer than it should be.This brings up another issue, the canned animations. Risen gleefully provides an animation for every single action you can do in the game world. Want to see what's in that cupboard? Your character will walk over to it and open each door (one at a time if you happen to be holding a torch, which is actually kind of impressive that they thought to do that), after which he will close the cupboard, one door at a time. No containers are allowed to be left open in this game, with the exception of actual building doors for some reason (I guess the islanders aren't big on privacy). This applies to every usable object and action in the game world. Your character will be locked into the animation until it is completed. This creates numerous frustrating moments when your character is caught looting in combat as he takes hit after hit while slowly closing the top of the chest he happens to be sifting through. It also provides moments of absurdity should you shoot your crossbow and hit jump while in the reloading animation. After reloading the weapon your character will immediately jump, after the 5 second reloading animation has run its course, preventing you from firing your now reloaded crossbow. You can also be stun locked off of ledges, resulting in you falling to your death if you are unfortunate, or to take heavy damage if you are not.In the same vein, the game possesses numerous geometry issues with terrain and player model interaction. On more than one occasion, I found myself stuck in a falling animation as my character bumped into a slight incline in the terrain geometry, enough that it was considered a ""step"" while also being tall enough to be considered a ""fall"". Fortunately you will know when this happens as your speakers will issue forth a cacaphony of juddering impact sounds (akin to the classic Half-Life crate/barrel collision noise).It should be noted that there were numerous problems between nagivating traps and the use of the various ""magic spells"" the game offers. Frequently, the use of a spell which turns your character into a tiny critter, would result in your untimely demise when reaching the otherside of a spike trap, though you are perfectly safe standing still between the spikes. As if the designers deliberatly set up a killzone on the otherside if you did not navigate it the way they desired you to. Strange considering you can just jump across some of them without being hurt.I almost forgot to mention that the spells themselves are all consumables requiring you to find more copies of that spell to use or to craft, which also requires consumables and specific recipies and their component materials. Some of these materials were not even available until half way through the game (nor was the ability to craft them either). Crafting (apart from making consumables) was an utter waste of time. There was no craftable armor, and the half dozen rings and swords you could make, were instantly outmoded when progressing the plot. It seems exceptionally odd to include prospecting, 3 prospectible materials, when all you can make is the same 4-5 swords. Accessory crafting relied heavily on what gems you've found, and generally only rarely provided an upgrade in equipment.On a positive note, all of the game's voiceover dialogue is entirely spoken and you won't find yourself reading walls of text (unlike this review). The voice acting is well done though character animations are sloppy and the dialogue itself is the basic cliche grim-dark fantasy stereotype.Character animations are fairly decent though tend to take on a comical exaggeration for certain actions.The astetic fits the narrative with some exceptions and is in keeping with the setting.The graphics are godawful for a game that was released in 2009. This was the year we had games like Grand Theft Auto 4, LA Noire, Fear 2, and Modern Warfare 2. These graphics looked like something out of 2003. The textures and meshes were passable, but some of the models were distinctly lacking in polygons.The plot is the most standard generic dark fantasy tripe that anyone ever shoveled out of a Penguin Book's publication, invovling the destruction of the Gods, the return of the Old Ones, and the awakening of the Titans. Boring, generic, hero's quest garbage where you the lone hero must overcome incalcuable odds and save the world from the most bad who is trying to gain the great power, despite spending half the game working with him to get access to it. Your intrique and ""choices"" are limited to, join the bandits, or join the inquisition (why there is an inquisition I have no frigging clue as they killed all their gods anyway and I didn't see anyone worshiping them). In the end nothing really important happens, the status quo is maintained, and the rest of humanity is apparently left to fend for themselves in the wake of on going giant monster attacks.Don't even bother with this game. If it comes in some kind of bundle I reccomend giving it away, particularly to someone you hate as it is more akin to torture than it is any semblance of fun. You should know what to expect from a studio like Piranha Bytes if you've played a game of Gothic 1-3.

												Recommended for a CERTAIN CROWD ONLY of which I am not a member.Pros:- Engaging drop-you-right-in-it story- Branching questlines- Gray moral choices (you have to pick a side in a conflict that's far from black-and-white good/evil)- Fantastic voicework- Unique and interesting magic system- Big open world feelThings some people will see as Pro and others as Con:- You will die lots- You will mess up and have to super backtrack multiple times or even game restart because you stat'ed wrong or sold a thing or killed an NPC, etc.- No way of knowing the level/strengths/abilities of an enemy aside from fighting itCons:- Graphics are a bit outdated- I've been pushed ""through"" solid walls by enemy attacks, sometimes ending up ""ouside"" cave areas stuck in glitch world- ""Classes"" are unbalanced- Some noticable dialogue glitches that are very annoying- Lockpicking sucks, many chests are locked, either learn the skill and play a luck-based minigame and stock up on the limited supply of lockpicks or wait for FREAKING EVER to get the unlock spellTHE COMBAT SYSTEM gets it own section because this is what made me have to stop playing. You will have to spend a decent amount of time in melee no matter what you build. Archer build would be super tricky because many quest-related combats are in arenas and some fights don't give you space to snipe, plus ammo is limited. Mage builds follow a questline that requires winning multiple melee combats first, and even when you do learn magic, it's expensive, mana doesn't regen except from food/potions that doesn't work mid-combat and sleep, and there's no casting without mana.That said, melee is done in a way that I personally find annoying as hell.I'm sure there are plenty of people who prefer combat to be more about technique than power. If you're good at it, you might enjoy having to actually pay attention to blocking, chaining combos, breaking blocks, sidestepping, dodging, chasing enemies around, baiting them toward you, setting up idk wtf. But this is the ONLY viable strategy.BECAUSE THE ENEMY KNOWS HOW TO BLOCK. AND DODGE. EVEN BIRDS AND INSECTS AND PORCUPINES. They can either block or they move faster than you and can easily dodge backwards out of the reach of chain combos. And the ones that can block can literally hold down block for ages while you wail on them for no damage. Breaking a block requires paying to learn (and being high enough level to learn) advanced techniques, and then executing them properly.You can't tank. There's no armor, only clothing sets that are extremely difficult to acquire (you get new clothes for joining factions, getting promoted, etc.) and rare helmets. Magic jewlery can provide some protection but you'll want those slots for boosting stats. You can't consume potions or food mid-combat to heal, and attempting to use healing magic just gives the enemy a chance to wail on you while you navigate you inventory, put away your weapon, use the scroll/spell, and pull out your weapon again. And no, health doesn't regen over time. IF you use a one-handed weapon like a sword, you can carry a shield, but it doesn't help all that much, and that's only a viable build for a non-magic-user.There also aren't ""rogue"" skills that would help negate blocking. There's no poison to chip away enemy health or technique to negate enemy armor with a smaller weapon.So you HAVE to learn the techniques. You HAVE to be fast enough to chain your attacks just right. Even first-level birds can destroy your health bar if you slip up, wasting precious time or resources. And getting dropped into mobs of fast moving enemies that circle around you is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥even if they're all low-level. You will take damage. It will suck.I really wanted to like this game. I wanted to play it for the story. But I can't deal with this damn combat system.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is old and it shows! This game while i did enjoy the lore, the character models and voice acting is sub par. Admittedly the environment does look great. Stepping away from lore and graphics lets talk about quests and combat. Quests are good and simple yet often times lack direction or are simply misleading. Now combat... Oh, God, the combat. Combat is old and feels old. It is choppy and has very poor controls that at some points make absolutely no sense and you'll find yourself pulling your hair out over fighting basic enemies. I've heard this game's combat is compared to that of dark souls but, they simply don't even compare and on top of that they came out in the same year. Honestly, if combat wasn't so necessary in this game, it would have been far more enjoyable. The world is immersive, the characters (while sometimes poorly voice acted) are interesting and multi layered, the leveling system is unique and rewarding however, the necessary and almost constant combat scenarios are damn near impossible due to the poor controls and choppy movement. I bought this game and was really hoping it would live up the the reviews that the majority of people seem to have of it. I was willing to sink hours upon hours into it and even kept coming back several times when I would get frustrated at it but, it just doesn't live up to the hype or reviews. If someone you know has this than, give it a try, it might be for you but, DO NOT spend money on it no matter how inexpensive it may become.

												This game look good from the screen shots and most of the intro game play was pretty nice. However, now that I'm actually into the game I'm finding that I'm seriously regretting this decision. It would be nice if the quests weren't vague as hell and if the map actually showed you the region where you need to go so I'm not wandering in the swamp getting killed every time I turn around by a creature that can one-shot me. That's another thing. It would be nice if I you found armor or were given armor, or could buy armor. This way I wouldn't get killed by everything. This is important since every starting quest you get involved having to beat up armored bandits to get them to do their jobs and/or wandering into the monster infested swamp. Glad I only spent a couple of dollars on this.			",36,28,0,20,5,1,3

												2016 Review:Graphics: 7Music: 7Fun: 7Value: 7Risen is a 3rd person POV RPG/adventure game. Focus is on combat and exploration. You are given choices in the story to choose what type of character you will develop, depending on the faction you choose. You can be a warrior type, mage or a hybrid of the two.  I found the story to be decent. Exploration was rewarding. Combat is pretty difficult, especially at the start. Getting 1 or 2 shotted by enemies is pretty common. You'll have to study your enemies to figure out their movements and time your attacks and blocks exactly right. As the game goes on, combat gets easier as you gain better armor, range weapons/magic and your attacks grow stronger.  There are some puzzles, but none that are too obtuse. All-in-all I found this to be a good game and worth your money, especially with some of the discounts going on where you might be able to pick up a pack Risen 1-3 games for a big discount.

												It was kind of pretty good game, but not really. The fighting system was fun while learning, but it's really mastered pretty quickly. Exploration was fun for a while, but it got repetitive pretty fast and following the quests pretty much tours you through the whole island so it's pointless to just wander around for fun. The final boss and ending were both very anticlimactic.I'd say buy if you'd like to just kill time with something totally average, otherwise don't bother.			",271,69,2,22,28,2,26

												Very clunky interfaces and main menu, extremely hard when just barely starting the game (practically anything can one shot you and while you try to heal you have to unequip your weapon while the enemy bashes in your skull), and the guy you play as is nowhere near as majestic looking as the one on the cover--I'm talkin' uuuuUUUUglyyyyyy. 4/10 Is somewhat enetertaining when you're bored and have no idea what to play but are feeling masochistic and want to play an RPG.

												This game is everything Gothic would have been if it were released fifteen years later. I recommed it to whoever enjoys the adventure/fps-combination and want a bit more challenge to the fights than pumping attack key. The game tells you to save often, and in truth you should do it after every battle; if you get caught with your pants down, it's all over in seconds.Graphics and audio is very good, even if my machine gets overheated quick on 2880x1620. Thankfully the game looks very good at lower resolutions, and I haven't had any game crashes so far in about 20 hours played.I'm using an ASUS laptop, i7 @2,20 GHz, 8 Gb RAM, SSD disk, Windows 8.1			",21,20,0,10,3,0,2

												You are a castaway. You wake up on an island loaded with evil temples and mutant animals, where everyone is addicted to drugs and alcohol, AIDS is rampant, and the vast majority of people speak in an English accent accompanied by expletives.Pros:- Great combat system- Good map structure- Intriguing questsCons:- Animations are sub-par- Immersion-ruining and rather excessive adult content (cursing, drugs and alcohol)- Mega-load of sexual content- No tutorial- Savescumming should be expected every step along the way     I admit that cursing can add to the intensity of a situation provided it's done at the right time, but there is excessive swearing in this game to the point of being irritating. See that pirate guy in the jail? Be prepared for him to say the F-word three times within two sentences.      As with cursing, drugs and alcohol are displayed in excess. Practically everyone either smokes or drinks. Finally, was it really necessary to put a brothel in the game, let alone right in the middle of the starter town?This really could have been a great game for me, but it was ruined by the buildup of these small annoyances.

												I didn˙t heard much of  this game before I played it, however I have to say that it`s really worth the time. It has a very long storyline, with wide side-mission list. The combat sometimes can be buggy, and annoying, but once you get into it, it's not a big deal.     The ability to choose between factions is great, however I only played it through once, so I don't know how much difference does it have between the playthroughs. The skills are mostly done right, you can't be in all role in the game, however I think that playing as a swordsmen is much more difficult like as an archer, or mage.I'd give the game a total of 8/10, so I think it's really worth a shot. You can get dozens of hours into it, and if you're a fan of RPG-s, you possibly won't be disappointed, if you don't take a faults of game too seriously.			",166,22,4,16,13,1,37

												This is a very good game, but very underrated. It's challenging, have a decent graphics, good story line. Sometimes it's a little frustrating, but probably 'cos I tried to beat enemies I shouldn't fight yet. You'll able to make different decisions, but they just effect your cast, abilities and some missions, not the end of the game. Some people complain about the controls, but with some practice you'll be fine. If you were into the Gothic series you'll love this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I loved the crap out of this game, but it isn't for everyone.The first five hours is spent dying. Your are totally outclassed on the simplest creatures. The next 15 hours involves you limping back to town every 5 minutes, dealing with insta-kill dungeon traps, and looting every container you can to avoid eating rats. You want to level up? Better pony up the cash because trainers aren't cheap. Every chest and skinned animal is a treasure to be savored.20 hours in and I got my first armor - Cloth robes.♥♥♥♥♥♥yeah!By the end of the game I was busting lizardking♥♥♥♥♥by the truckload and not even breaking a sweat.While not designed with the budget of a Bethesda title, Risen has a heart that permeates everything from level design, to voice acting, to the little tooltips on junk you pick up.

												Giving this 6.5/10.I'ts playable to end with patience. While it justifiabley deserves more, I was hit with a bug that prevented me upgrading my swordfighting.The game itself is quite brilliant. Controls are easy, the scenery's good, and the story is easily interesting enough. However I was hit by two things that slowed the game down badly. Early on, my recommendation letter was not accompanied with directions where to take it. I wandered for at least eight hours. Eventually I searched online and found where to go. Second my close combat was hindered by my inability to advance my sword fighting stats.Another of my grumbles, is that about a fifth of Risen, is spent in the dark. Medieval torches did little to help, and you have to drop them to battle, if your're using two hands. In there I was locked in battles with lizard warrior foes that took me hours and hours and hours to defeat. Shame. [Plus the disgusting noise the lizards make - urghh. It's like the sound of regurgitation and growling mixed.]Many seem to complain that Risen is slow, but if you're patient you have masses of fun. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not a terrible game, but not quite good enough to get a recommendation. Game takes place on a small island, with only 1 real town in it. You spend the entirety of the game going between 3-4 little outposts areas and going in dungeons, so it doesn't feel very epic or varied. In classic pirhanna bytes fashion, the game is buggy with clunky mechanics. Theres a bug where you can't climb ledges without disappearing and having to restart, and this happens every time you try and climb, making it a gamebreaking bug. You have to go specifically to your video card settings in your control panel to change it. The combat is awful. There's dodging and attacking and blocking, but it is pretty terrible. You never know when enemies are going to attack. The worst is, while youre hitting them and damaging, they can suddenly shake off being hit and start blocking, parry you, or even worse....somehow attack betweem your combo and start hitting you. But if they do that, you're never able to attack during their combo. Sometimes you can block during, but many times they can keep hitting you. This terrible unpredictable system that benefits enemies causes you to only hit once or twice because you can't trust combos. The parry system doesn't work, and trying to do it just gets you hurt, causing you choose to just block instead. The dodging only works sometimes, others even when you dodge you still somehow get hurt. The quest system is terrible. There's no markers, no clean indication of where to find qhich questions, and when you go to the quest in your log, there is no objective listed or even the most recent directions given by the person. There is a lot of quests to do, and multiple choices and different options, different factions, and some questions cancelling out others, which is nice. The leveling system is terrible. Gaining a level gives you 0 stats or abilities. You then need to find the specific trainer to not only train stats, but also abilities. It also costs money. And some trainers you need to do quests before they train you, meaning you can lose out on abilities if you didn't make the right choices. I never got a chance to use many magic spells because i never found the exact trainer for them, which is stupid, or I didn't have enough GOLD to get stat points. The armor systems stinks too. I never found helmet armor until the like 10-15 hours in, only found  3 chest pieces in 20 hours, and a few different rings. That was the boring system. The game is long though, and has a lot to do.In the end, the bugs, the terrible combat, the bad inventory, the small world, and the awful quest system all cause this game to be below par, which is normal for these developers. Not a terrible game though. 6/10.			",452,80,11,25,16,6,21

												Risen is a half-good game. every aspect of the game has it's good side and bad side.the combat system is sometimes enjoyable, but it feels very limited and sometimes is also broken, there's an automatic targeting system that don't work well even with two enemies in front of you. the quests are interesting but the quest management system is really badly designed and the quest theirself are poorly written, and often you'll not understand what you have to do. same goes for the story, the subject could have been good but is really poorly written which leads to a very boring experience, even the final boss and the ending are totally flat and summon no emotion at all. do youreself a favour and don't buyu it			",180,31,41,17,35,2,37

												Absolutely rediculous combat mechanics. Frustrating to the point where I couldn't progress. Whenever you strike or dodge, you cannot move until that animation is complete, making strategic manouvering useless. When dodging an attack to strike back, they perform an animation to step back, meaning you miss and they leave you open for attack while you helplessly complete the animation. Enemies can stagger you at the slightest hit, yet you cannot stagger them; this makes the combat feel very unbalanced. I'm an experienced RPG player yet I think this combat system completely ruins the exploration of this game.			",118,5,0,13,9,0,3

												The Risen series are great games but you can't mod the steam versions at all. Steam don't want you playing around within the game's files and so mods don't take effect. One of the most essential Risen mods {the 4GB patch} to get the game to run properly and without crashes, can't be used with the Steam version, essentialy breaking Risen and rendering it unplayable. It was only $2 in the winter sales and I still regret my purchase. Fix your♥♥♥♥♥♥ steam.			",53,27,0,10,5,0,0

												Risen is like drinking beer, it reall sucks at first and tastes like crap, but eventually you develop a taste and cannot get enough. This inevitably leads to spending all your time on the game, losing your job, your wife, your dog, and then ending up on some horrible MTV version of intervention.Still a good game.

												First of all - I am a huge Gothic fan. I like the first two installments of the series (along with the Night of the Raven). I couldn't get over Gothic 3, Forsaken Gods and Arcania - they simply broke my heart.Now, please, turn on this track before you start reading this review. I insist:

Turned on? Okay, you're good to go.Risen isn't a perfect game, but it's good enough for me. I'm enchanted with Gothic, of course, but that's a legitimate reason for me to like Risen. The game has many references to Gothic (familiar character names, bandit camp in the swamps, Harbor City, civil war, an isolated island with tense residents - it just makes you feel like in the two original Gothic games).What can I say about graphics... I'm not someone who is familiar with the newest graphics. I played Metal Gear Solid 5: Ground Zeroes and I can admit that the graphics there are astonishingly beautiful. What about Risen? They're... different than that. That's all I can say. I just lost track and can't really tell a difference. I guess it might be safe to say that this game's graphics have aged somehow, but they aren't bad even for today's standards.The audio is lacking in something - particularly Kai Rosenkranz's music (EDIT: actually, I just found out that Kai *did* compose Risen's OST - but it is different for some reason, so different that I couldn't even tell this was Kai's music indeed). This is the thing I miss the most. Kai really had a talent to create great, varying moods throughout the entire games with mere music. Once you feel at ease, at another time you feel tense, and at totally another time you feel grave. I would dare to call him one of the best composers, I would even dare to say he's better than Soule. Risen lacks this atmospheric music, unfortunately. It changes your mood subtly, but it simply isn't as powerful as it was in Gothic. Still, it has some catchy tracks, but you just can't really remember where they play after you turn the game off. Gothic didn't have that problem at all. If you did as I asked you to do - turned the Monastery track from Gothic II, it should have ended at this point. If it didn't, you probably have heard a large portion of it, or at least it started to loop. You can finish listening to the track, or simply stop it. Your choice. However you decide to do, please, turn this track on right now. I insist:

The difference is obvious.The gameplay is the most important aspect to criticize here. And here's the trouble. I cannot be unbiased. Like I said, I treasure Gothic dearly, and this game *is* like Gothic. You have many references to it (or just self-repeating patterns because of the developers' laziness - but it doesn't bother me, I like it). If you played Gothic, you'd have no trouble figuring Risen out, no walkthroughs needed at all. But if you're new to PB's games, then I suspect this game will be a challenge to you.The island is small (about the same size as Khorinis). But it is extremely detailed. I couldn't find any broken places with floating trees, rocks or other, similar stuff (hi, Todd*). The world is semi-open - just like in Gothic. It doesn't feel like you're crawling through dungeons and linear pathways. Of course, that means the world isn't randomly generated on the spot by the game, and everything is pre-defined, which can be either a pro or a con, depending on the perspective (this makes this game's replay value lower, I guess).The fighting system reminds me of Gothic - you can't just click mindlessly, but time your clicks and have a tactical approach to fights. If you are stupid, you can be level 15 and get beaten by a pack of wolves. But if you're smart, you can defeat a tough, armored guy equipped with a decent sword when you are a fresh castaway. Your combat ability depends mostly on your skill as a player, not on your characters' stats. Of course, even the best players will probably lose against some opponents if the odds are impossible enough.It is a specific game. Not for everyone. But still, is any game suited for everyone?All in all, if you are a fan of first two Gothic games - do get it. I'm sure you won't regret it. If not - get a demo and try it. Or simply ignore it. Maybe it'll appeal to you, maybe not. You will have to try it out yourself.My personal rating: 8/10.(*Todd Howard, CEO of Bethesda Softworks, famous mostly because of The Elder Scrolls series and Fallout 3 and New Vegas)

												Keep in mind I didn't get to play this much before it glitched so hard I was just too frustrated to continue.  The gameplay is reasonable, but combat is tedius and clunky.  It's possible once you learn magic and get further that cleans up.  Problem is I hit a point where I kind of half fell into a floor and vanished, and all game controls other than looking up and down stopped working.  ESC didn't even bring up the main menu any more, I had to kill the game.  There is no save function, so if you die or quit or something like this happens you roll back to some seemingly random point and have to play through the other stuff all over again.  Even if the gameplay improves, these issues are just killer to me.			",94,11,0,16,6,0,32

												I gave this game an honest shot, I mean I really tried, but after 5 hours it had not gotten to a place where I was having fun.  The combat quickly gets boring and repetitive, and the questing and map systems are horrid.   Reading on the internet I'm told it gets better but I decided to put this one down.  If I ever get the will to try to continue it I I'll finish this review. I may try Risen 2 and if it holds up then I may go back.For a game from 2009 it does not seem to hold up to where the industry was at that time.			",272,84,13,40,25,5,58

												Good game but the combat drags it down quite a bit. Maybe it's because I am missing something here, but the combat is not engaging and deep as the developers seem to have intended. Instead it's annoying and repetitive. The rest of the game is quite well done.The world itself is very well crafted and cool. With many different environments and creatures to fight, it's fun to explore. Along with that which I very much appreciate is that there are areas where you will be very much under powered and will be squished like an ant if you venture there. Instead of the hand holding and area leveling that most other games in the open world rgp genre employ.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not surprising when you search for Risen on google the biggest amount of threads revolve around combat in this game and there appears to be two schools of thought about this: Some consider it rewarding once you learn it. others consider it just plain bad. After playing this title for some time it really is the second opinion that wins. 'But it's good that it's hardcore, i like it that way' some say. No it's not. Play Inquisitor or Dark Souls if you want it tough. Plain bad does not equal hardcore. Not with the amount of good alternatives Steam provides today. To put it bluntly: If you are considering to buy this then ask yourself - are you ready to spend lots of time playing out a luke-warm story that is constantly hampered by bad combat and aging graphics? I say don't bother.  I spent almost 5 hours on this and did not get anything out of it. Nothing. no memorable places or events or anything. Could not possibly be more grayer game start. And i really don't give a damn if 'it gets good later'. I seriously doubt it after seeing how the dialog and quest systems work in addition to just plain bad combat.			",776,311,45,87,97,7,148

 OVERALL: 4/10 ===Pros & Cons + Pros + + Good level of interaction with NPCs+ Choices you make in the Storyline will drastically change where you end up and what quests you do+ Good stealth mechanics - Cons - - Combat system is completely broken (there will be a special section down in the review where i will explain this in detail)- Miserable variety of equipment and loot- Character leveling system and development are aswell completely broken (details later)- The class you develop is bond to certain questlines you may or may not follow (details down aswell)- Miserable graphics even for the year it came out- Interaction with the game world is non-existent- Characters are anonymous, uninteresting and inexpressive. It looks like talking to (badly) animated tree stumps.=== Special Section - About Gameplay, Combat System and Character Progression This is an extraordinaire section i made just for THIS review, in which i will explain to you, esteemed reader, the abyssal flaws i have described up above.1. Combat System: Risen's combat system, regarding melee mostly, is such a mess i have rarely witnessed in my whole gaming career. First of all, attack patterns, movement animations, speed, parry system are wholly flawed beyond repair. Enemies can dodge your attacks which is fine, but they can aswell attack just after they dodged, in the span of a tenth of a second, which you cannot do at all, and then repeat their attack animation a random number of times consecutively, this can very certainly end up with your character being 1-shotted by an unstoppable series of attacks you cannot parry, for there is a little delay between when you are wounded and when you can again parry; this delay is larger than the delay between the enemy attacks, so you cannot do any action while under a barrage of attacks.Secondly, facing multiple enemies is totally unfeasible: you can focus your attention on just one direction while attacking, your attacks are bond to follow that direction as long as the animation goes on. This means, you cannot, say, hit one enemy with a slash then hit another one near him and then a third one. Attacking one enemy leaves you totally exposed from all other directions, from which enemy can attack you like i described before. Player cannot even lure single enemies, as triggering combat with one will very likely trigger the whole enemy field and drag you to a multiple combat you have zero chances to win, unless said enemies are very far below your level.Third, animations are clunky, unresponsive and generally really messy. Players will have trouble timing attacks and also to spot when an enemy is going to attack, since there is no pre-attack animations, nothing, enemies just stand there then attack instantly without any little notice, and then return to their idle animation.2. Character Development: Oh boy here we go. first of all your class is bond to the storyline you might want to follow: for example if you choose to be a bandit, you will not be able to be a mage. This because when you level up, this game has no normal RPG style level up system, but instead gives you Learning Points, and nothing else. These points can be used at specific trainers around the world to improve your Statistics or Abilities. Fact is, certain branches of the Main Quest will allow you only to learn certain classes' skills as i said before. This limits the experience a player may want to pursue heavily. Also, trainers cost Gold, each ability you learn costs gold, and also Statistics cost gold, other than Learning Points.This system is totally failed and limits the developmetn of your character by a lot.=== Final Thoughts Risen could be a nice game with its setting and storyline, but many gameplay-breaking issues and bad art direction flaw this game beyond salvation.I do not recommend this game at all, unless you just want a world of pain and suffering.

The combat is incredibly clunky, glitches are everywhere, the island you're on is not the least bit interesting, enemy variety is very poor, and the main character has to be the least interesting and most annoying peasant/errand boy in the universe.

												A spiritual successor to Gothic with similar character building, similar quests, similar combat for similar players.Looks pretty dated, but worse: it feels pretty dated, too. The combat is clunky as heck, the quests are simple, the story is even more so. It seems difficult but that comes mostly from how awkward fighting is, especially against multiple mobs.It might offer hours worth of roaming and killing, but I wouldn't recommend it unless it is on sale and you liked Gothic.

												The melee combat system is incredibly bad and possibly the worst I have ever had the displeasure of suffering through, but that's only the tip of the iceburg.Enemies will block any time you're attacking and wait for a split second where they can attack, dealing 1/4 to 1/2 of your health in a single attack because you have no access to armor until you go through a long series of quests that involve fighting said enemies, said enemies can also chain attacks.And even if I had somehow managed to get armor I have my suspicions that it wouldn't have done much for protection until I got really really good armor.You're given the option to either continuously attacking and hope you catch them in that split second they decide to stop blocking, or you get behind them, which of course barely works.Enemies turn on a dime to track you, the only conceivable way to get behind them is by dodging, which of course also barely works as you will go straight in whatever direction you dodged, and enemies recover quickly so if you don't do it perfectly you'll never get behind them.Enemy and player blocking can be lowered by having two characters attack at once, but from my frustrating experience you're always alone, and enemies are often in numbers, so if you're not fighting them in a hall with no room for them to move about, you're going to get hit with a chain of attacks because your blocking is meaningless.Another frustrating experience is that though you're not guaranteed to be killed, even the so-called friendly NPCs who you train with will rob you blind if you lose a fight.I have heard many good things about Risen which is why I bought this game, but from my experience it seems very little thought and testing was put into the combat, and I'll said it again, this is possibly the worst melee combat system I have ever had the displeasure of suffering through.

												I wanted to like Risen. The developers have tried their best to create a meaninful world and to some extent, they've actually succeeded. However, this game simply has enough negative points for me to not enjoy it very much. The combat is extremely clunky and spammy yet slow, to a point where it feels like a chore to actually win some of the fights. Fights by itself aren't too hard unless you're trying to take on someone who is way beyond your level.Glitches are also a big problem with this game. I encountered multiple glitches along the way, some requiring me to use the console in order to progress in the game. Eventually I was faced with a quest I could not complete at all and I was forced to replay a good part of the game (I had kept older saves around, thankfully).Having said all this, I don't feel like I can recommend Risen. It had potential but sadly it's simply too aged to be a good game. I have some hope for the newer installments of the series, even though I usually prefer to play games that are a few years old. That's one of the reasons why I wanted to like this game.			",346,47,25,55,22,2,48

												Here is a list of reasons why I do not recommend this game1. Without adjustment it doesnt seem to work on windows 72. The autosave suddenly saves over your tactically placed manual save. 3. Your character is super sluggish when reacting to button prompts.4. In addition to #3 the actions taken by yourself and NPC's once engaged are almost comical in speed. Making it impossible to respond to anything. Best part is that when you hit someone, they dont get stunned, they just hit you back.5. On top of being sluggish it is nearly impossible to gauge distancing in this game, you can suddenly just get hit from enemies.6. If you accidentally steal an item, that person and all his buddies want you dead. period. for what seems to be the rest of the game, this makes for a game- over like result when it autosaves right after it happens.. Great idea developers.I can handle harder gameplay, but bad gameplay is another story..I will probably give this game 1 more try, only because I hate wasting money on things. I really want to like it, but I am finding myself trying hard to try too, which isnt a good sign. Spend your money elsewhere.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm a fan of RPGs of any age but Risen, unfortuantely, has to go on my 'no fun to play' list. I had hopes going in it'd be fun, given it has a different style to classic action-RPG mechanics but most of these differences were very frustrating because the game itself does an EXTREMELY poor job of, at least, making you aware of the changes. Did not make for a good start for a Let's Play series on YouTube.The graphics and audio have aged well, though the characters are pretty bland and uninteresting for the most part... but I admit I haven't gotten far in the game. The lack of presence of the story also does not encourage me to keep playing. Without a solid anchor to the narrative, I can't really immerse myself into the game. For games like Skyrim, it works well because they hook you into the story within the first couple of hours but Risen just doesn't get the hooks and alludes to no concept of the story you're suppose to be experience in the first part. You're just some dude who got ship-wrecked and, for some reason, has to pick a side without knowing what the hell is really going on. (Which I am aware you find out later)Most of the controls I had to learn through trial and error, since the tutorial parts are either bugged or just stop after teaching you how to open your inventory, looking at the character screen, and how to swing your weapon. Things like blocking and parrying are fairly easy to figure out but dodging took some effort as well as how to upgrade my stats, since leveling up doesn't seem to affect them at all, which would have been nice to be made aware of at the start and I still don't think I understand the whole system revolving stats aside from blowing gold on trainers... who seemed rather expensive in the early stages.Then there's armor... probably my biggest issue with the game. The fact I didn't find a piece of armor at all but I was practically tripping over weapons was quite confusing. I honestly thought I had broken the game or was just being an idiot (I like to think I'm semi-good at video games, especially RPGs) but when I researched several walkthroughs on the game, it became very clear you can only recieve armor under particular circumstances or paying a lot of gold if you manage to find a vendor that's got a set so... that was a huge 'NO' in my book. Not asking to have everything I kill drop items like a pinata but there should have been as many options on armor availability as there were weapons. Gathering the gold was an unneccessary and annoying side track that ate into time I could have spent progressing the story... but then some of the enemies towards finishing up joining The Don were barely survivable unless you have impeccable block/parrying skills (which I did not).Though I, personally, would not recommend this game to anyone and have much more confidence in other RPGs from the same time that would be enjoyable... I'd say give it a shot if you're interested and draw your own conclusion. I just found this title to be no fun and that does not give me hopes for its two sequels.			",135,21,1,31,23,2,25

If I were mentally deficient I would probably have no problem with the sheer random jank in the game, but since I'm not I can't like it. Fighting isn't ""complex"" or ""elaborate"" or ""hard"": it's boring. Hold shield, wait until they atack, attack afterwards. Watch as only 20% of your attacks actually hit. Oh look, you want to play a mage? Well there's absolutely no ♥♥♥♥ing lead up to knowing how to (Thanks Google) and since the entire ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ story seems to be ""Become a bandit, because you don't know that that makes you an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ until you've already commited to it"".Honestly this game is terrible, if you're not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and actually like games to be well designed. If not, then play this one since it seems pretty good. You click buttons and stuff.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought the Risen Pack while it was on sale. I've heard good things about Risen and Gothic and thought I should give it a try. So this review is relatively neutral and only my personal opinion.- I can't get into it. Even after 9 hours of playtime I still don't get the feeling that I'm playing an evolving character. - NPC's react based on certain events so they seem to be a bit schizophrenic- Some people might say that the fight system is hard to master, but I think it's simply not responsive. - And I must admit that I'm not a fan of the level system. (No need to feelhappy when you earned a ""Level up!"" ...you first need to find a teacher and a lot of money to get something out of it)It's not a bad RPG and but for me it's far from beeing a good one.

												So I really liked this game.  Surprisingly decent writing, and reminds me of old-school games where you can just kill people instead of doing quests for them.However, thumbs down.  It's pretty unbalanced, playing as a melee character is much more difficult than magic or ranged.  And then there are the bugs.  I can't jump onto any ledges without the game ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ out and having to reload.  The second half of the game has a lot of jumping, and I eventually had to cheat and get Levetation spells just to finish the game because otherwise I would get stuck and reload over and over and over again.And get used to reloading, because the game bugs out a lot and you will lose progress if you don't save every 5 seconds.To put a cap on it, after all those hours... the ending was atrocious.

												Ugh, I don't know how this game got so many positive reviews. There's just one word I can use to describe it: boring. You start out on a beach, wander around for a while, sleep in an abandoned shack, and eventually find a bunch of people who ask you to do their menial tasks. I played almost 7 hours, hoping something interesting would happen. After completing a quest whose objective was to hide out in a barn, I lost all interest. The combat is frustrating, the loot is boring and rare, the story is dull, the monsters are unremarkable, and the game just overall put me to sleep.2/10 would not find beer for town drunk again			",370,114,4,79,36,1,78

												For the first 24 hours or so of playing this game, I was sure that I'd be giving it a positive review if for no other reason than because I had spent nearly all of my free time playing it since I started. By the end of it the best thing I can say about it is that I'm still interested in trying Risen 2.The tone of the first half and the second half of the game is alarmingly different. From when you first wash up on the beach with a fellow castaway who proves entirely irrelevant to the point where the main plot is actually explained to you, the game spends its time impressing upon you how much of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ the island you arrived at is and how the population is the exact mix of workshy, cynical and desperate to put you in a position of solving all their problems for them out of sheer exasperation. It's a fairly interesting setup that manages to keep the usual RPG fetch quest formula while also completely justifying it and making sure it never feels like irrelevant busywork.The second half of the game is killing lizardmen in a dungeon crawl.I'm barely exaggerating. Chapters 3 and 4 of the game are spent almost entirely in one dungeon or another, fighting wave after wave of lizardmen. While the early half of the game was fairly restrained in its call to violence, to the point where I don't think I killed more than a dozen humans over the entire course of the game, limiting combat mostly to fending off ill-tempered wildlife, the latter half has you cut down hundreds of lizard men.And to be clear, there's a good reason the combat was so restrained in the first half - Risen's combat is AWFUL. Take Dark Souls, remove the stamina bar, but also take away dodge-rolling, slow block speed to a crawl, and only give the player five armor upgrades over the entire game. I admit with zero shame that I eventually got sick of this and activated godmode at around 2/3rds of the way through Chapter 3. The combat is tolerable in controlled doses, but the second half of the game is almost nothing BUT combat, which the system clearly wasn't designed with in mind.A few more warnings to keep in mind should you try it for yourself:- Don't sell your scrolls, at least not the Telekinesis, Levitation, or Nautilus ones. Despite the ostensible freedom of the RPG mechanics, most of the 'puzzle' mechanics blatantly only have one solution, that being magic. Maybe one in five will give you a problem that can be solved with a bit of athleticism or archery.- Speaking of, don't bother with archery. It doesn't do much damage and the entire group will immediately bumrush you after the first arrow. Additionally, the ranged weapon skills only upgrade draw and reload speed in 10% increments, with no further abilities.- The jump mechanics are quite possibly the absolute worst I've ever seen in a game. In addition to being just really floaty, Risen's edge physics are absolutely terrible. There were roughly a dozen instances where I'd climb up or dump down from a ledge only for the game to be unable to decide whether I'd landed on the ledge or was supposed to slide down, and instead of pushing me down like most games do, it simply left me hovering in the air forever, forcing me to either load a save or restart the program entirely. Unfortunately the game requires you to climb or jump more than a few times to progress, so all I can recommend here is to save often.While the overstuffed combat and the tedium of the second half thoroughly alienated me, I enjoyed the game's opening hours well enough that I'm still going to give Risen 2 a try, but personally I'd say this is one to skip.

												Well guys, as far as an RPG goes this one's a bit messed up. First, lets get the things they've done okay to well noted down: The pace of this game very good but the story is about average, Cliche, but better than some. This is NOT a short 10 hour romp of patheticness that RPGs made now are and the leveling/advancement of your character are at about where you would expect. In addition the world looks amazing especially for when it was made and it doesn't hold your hand as much. NO LOAD SCREENS! Well, Almost none, you WILL be hitting quick load a lot, but I'll get into that later. For the world, story, and looks I'd give this game a 7/10. But, like nearly all seemingly good things this is completely ruined by the following:It commits close to, if not ALL of the unforgivable combat gaming sins:     -all enemies physical attacks are normally twice as fast as yours.     -The game randomly slows your attack to 1/10th your normal speed, giving all enemies      around you free hits as you can't get out of the animation, thus killing you by default through      no fault of your own.     -Your enemies, including wild animals, can parry your parries, but you as a player can't even      with max skills.     -All enemies can attack and hit you instantly, you cannot. Your sword can literally be      connecting with them in your attack and the enemy will often instantly get a super powerfull      atack in that is so fast you can bearly see them move,      doing massive damage to you. You as a player are not capable of this.     -Dodging is of no use as your enemies can track you through it perfectly and hit you anyway. You as a player can't       track or hit, even by chance, a dodging enemy.     -Enemies have unlimited numbers of attacks they can string together while the player, even with the skill that       supposadly allows such, cannot.     -All enemies recover from recoil 3 times faster than you do.     -Enemies sometimes become invulnerable and cannot be harmed, this is also not fixable by reloading a save and       requires the game to be restarted.     -Your character is sometimes spun around by enemy attacks and of course, you are not able to do this to them.     -If you save after you have an enemy's attention any reload of that save will load that enemy within stricking range of      you and attacking, no matter where they were when the original save was created. This renders such save unusable     as you end up dieing the moment the game loads every time, no matter what the cercumstances before the save.     -All enemy melee weapons have greater range than yours no matter what. Enemy has a dagger and you have a two      hand sword? Their dagger out-ranges your sword. Even animals out range your weapons with their horns and teeth.     -Enemy gaurding has a good wide range of defense from the front, But you only have defense for a tiny sliver of angle      that leaves you pulling your hair out as you watch blades swing THROUGH your shield to hit you.So, all in all I'd give non-combat parts of the game a good 7/10. It is a good story and environment but it isn't anything we havent seen before and the story is cliche. But for combat I give it a definate 0/10, that's right, an actual ZERO out of ten. Combat is so buggy and un refined it renders the game completely unplayable a lot of the time and melee combat is based purely on you getting lucky. So unfortunately, I have to give an overall score of 3/10 and can't at all recomend this game to anyone who doesn't want massive levels of frustration.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After their harrowing escape from JoWood and the abysmal pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥that turned out to be Gothic 3, Pirhana Bytes got their groove back in this decent action RPG much more in line with Gothic 1 and 2.

												DOn't buy it for full price. It got a bad story, bad fighting system, many many frustrating moments, badly designed overpowered enemies liek the ghuls or some enemies which appear later in game.DOn't learn fighting with staff. It's frustrating ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Learn axe. it's effective and fast. Being fast is the most important point in fights in this game. Slow weapons will kick your own♥♥♥♥♥Learn Alchemy. It's really overpowered and strong. You can make powerful potions to gain strong effects. Don't learn acrobatics. you will find milions of rings who give it for free.So my few advices and warnings. It's beautiful to wander through this world and exploring it. Finding hidden stuff and hidden ways to new areas is great.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After playing Risen for less then 5 hours I encountered no less than 3 bugs that just ruined the experience for me. I'm talking about the kind of bug that you can only fix by entering console mode and typing strange commands to undo events or retrigger scripted ones. Bugs like ""I talked with X before talking to Y and then I don't have the dialogue options needed to complete a mission anymore"". Or I slept before talking to X and he disappears, so my only option is to respawn him using the console.But equally impressive was how easy it was to find out the console commands needed to redress each situation. Apparently these bugs are so common that there are thousands of forums and threads about them. And I read about so many other bugs while looking for my solutions that I just lost all desire to go ahead with the game.My conclusion is that this game's scripting system is completely broken, and for me that makes it unplayable. I really recommend skipping this one. I got this game bundled with Risen II, and my real interest was on the second one. I haven't tried it yet, but now I'm hoping it's not broken as the first is.Update: I'm glad to say that Risen II is very solid. Finished it without a single issue. Recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Went back to playing this game after nearly 4 years. Its still good. And its still hardcore. I dont know, I couldn't explain it - but aside from its quirky, clunkiness, I still find the game so much more fulfilling in levelling up. Maybe because its hard? Maybe because its old school? You just get more and more attached to your character because you know you worked hard.  I dunno, for some reason I'm having a wee bit more fun playing this right now than...Skyrim maybe?

												Awful combat system (frustrating even), and an awful combat system really makes the whole game unplayable. I think AI is cheating or something because almost everytime whenever you lower your shield, you'll get attacked by mobs. Don't buy this game unless you're a huge fan of hardcore RPG games, have lots of time to spend replaying, reloading last save etc.			",108,31,2,19,16,1,23

												Risen is a game of 'let's pretend' for both its developers and devoted fans - let's pretend that it's a hardcore RPG; let's pretend that it's acceptable for a game to be bad until the second act; let's pretend that the combat isn't a chore to sit through. Risen wants to be seen as a no-nonsense ""classic"" RPG, but all it really does is make the game little more than a chore to sit through. The game starts out with promise, where humanity has forced the Gods from its island, only to face a new and much deadlier threat: the Titans. With the Titans coming to power, powerful storms destroy anything outside of the islands, and mysterious temples rise from the ground to spread fear and, to the adventerous, the urge to explore. Your character is a shipwreck survivor, and a wreck in every other way possible, and is stranded on an island he's never been to before. You're completely neutral from the start, with no intentions of saving the world or conquering it, making it very much like some of my favourite RPGs where you start with no goal. This however doesn't take long to change.From the very start of the game, the combat begins badly and is only worsened over time. At first, sluggish one-two punches and weak waist high kicks are tolerable, but as one acquires weapons, they feel weighty without being visceral. Fighting in this game is nothing like a hardcore RPG, in which you have to know each enemy inside out and strategise before every encounter because, quite frankly, it's impossible. There's absolutely no flow or grace to the combat, instead having clunky dodge mechanics and weird AI, not to mention the animations which make it look bad as well as feel that way. Despite all the moves you can learn with new skills, there's just no variety of moves - it's simple 3-clicks of the left mouse button, and perhaps a bit of moving involved. The worst part about this is that some minor tweaks to the fight engine could've made this significantly better. Instead, I'd sooner avoid fights than risk my sanity for some wolf pelts and raw chicken.Speaking of which, the loot is pathetic. With armour only being available from a few vendors (and so far I've counted 4 pieces of armour in total, two of which are just ordinary clothes), expect to find crummy weapons like sharpened branches, clubs and rusty blades. Don't be disappointed either when you find little gold from the mobs you kill, most of which will be animals anyway, so unless you can find quests where meat and hides are the requirements, you won't get rich quickly, or really at all.But you need to be wealthy in order to make use of your skill points, as with each level up you get 10 skill points to spend on combat and non-combat skills. Seeing as only your health increases when you level up, it's best to spend these points as soon as possible with a clear idea of what you want from them. Oh, and you have to pay the trainer too. Essentially you can learn about 2-3 skills per level, increasing either your stats, combat abilities with certain weapons or learn professions and thievery skills. However by level 10 you'll have learnt the most interesting stuff like pickpocketing (which in fairness is the most useful thing in the game), lockpicking and Alchemy to make potions, so you'll be stuck with saving up to learn how to fight competently.Not that you need to worry about fighting well too much, considering the best time I had in the game (and perhaps this will apply to you; it definitely will when you get into a scrap) was doing fetch quests and talking to people. I'm not one to tolerate MMO-style questing especially in a single player RPG where I want to get away from it all, but when you experience the worst Risen has to offer early on, anything looks better later on. Getting involved in both factions' stories, especially when they escalate in Harbour Town, was far more interesting than whatever's going on with the gods, titans and whatever main story I'm supposed to actually care about.The biggest issue that plagues this game is not its combat, its painfully average writing, its lame voice acting, poor visuals or forgettable - but excellent - sound design; it's the pace. In a nutshell, it takes far too long to get to the decent part of the game, and even then it can be hit or miss. The game requires about five to ten hours, possibly more if it's your first time playing to get to Harbour Town where the two factions can be seen at their best. It's there where you'll find better gear and supplies, plus you'll probably be powerful enough to take on basic to average-level monsters. I don't know about you, but I firmly believe a game should be good the moment I boot it up, not have some potential, and then have to slog through 10+ hours of the most tiring quests I've ever seen to get to what may or may not be better quests.However, the game may appeal to those who can live without quest help and fast travel, for a time. Having to listen to quest dialogue and take notes about important locations or items is as ""classic"" as this RPG gets, because there's little in the way of map markers or quest pointers; instead you have to rely on the maps you've obtained and find the route to the red dot on it yourself. However if you're a TESIV: Oblivion generation player like myself, this may take some getting used to.I'm not mad because of the lack of modern features which could make the game significantly better; I'm mad because this game wastes too much of the players' time before they so much as feel competent. It's more depressing than disempowering, and for that I cannot recommend Risen. If you need a second opinion, check out my video review below.WARNING: CONTAINS SWEARIES.

												In general, the game works. There are some good gameplay elements that can happen. There was a lot of potential...It just wasn't fun. The story wasn't interesting. Everything was just so ""cookie cutter"" and, in general, not memorable. I had to force myself to finish this game just so I had the right to talk about the game in the way I'm talking about now.I ended up getting both this game and the second one for a dollar in some bundle. I kind of wish I used that money to feed kids in Africa and donated my time spent playing in a soup kitchen.The second one will not get a play from me nor will the third unless the devs found me, tied me up, and forced me to play - gun at the heads of my family members... and even then I might hesitate.  3/10			",80,17,0,16,13,2,7

												First of all: I clicked ""no"" at the question if I reccomend this game. This is because I'm disappointed. If you loved the Gothic games and want to play the exact same thing again I might reccomend this game to you.Here's why I didn't like it: It feels exact the same way like Gothic 1 & 2 (I personally didn`t pla Gothic 3 so I can't tell much about that one) The same kind of factions the same kind of classes the same kind of skills. Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed G1 and 2 very much. But this is a new IP and yet theres nothing new to it. Except the graphics engine and the caribbean theme. But in the end I didn't feel much of that because the game itself was soooo close to gothic. Sadly there are no gameplay mechanics wich adress the pirate or caribbean theme.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game along with Risen 2 as a package on 7/9/2014.  Both games will load a splash screen then crash.  I have tried to delete the games then reinstall them and get the same results.  Over the years I have purchased 33 games and have had no trouble until now.  What makes things worse I can not contact Steam for a solution.  I tried to resolve the issue on thier support page and I was directed to the company that developed the products and they in turn said contact the place of purchase.  How can I do that.  Steam does not post any phone numbers.  It looks like I am stuck with these two games.  Buyer be aware.			",11,4,0,9,5,0,21

												A little hard to get the hang of initially but once you've learnt the controls it seems like it will be a great game. Combat is hard, which I don't mind as it was a challenge, but not just hard difficulty wise, hard to control also. All the speech and character interaction was good.I only got 2 hours into the game. The game crashed 2 times for me so I had to redo large portions again from when I last saved. Then as I was finally getting into it again and progressed far, the game crashed again. I gave up.Bring on Risen 2!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Easily the worst free-roaming action RPG in all of creation.This game fails at good gameplay, fails at good storytelling, and fails at a balanced experience.But worst of all, and this is unforgivable, it fails to get you to care.  Not even fun as a lark or a challenge.  You cannot wander twelve steps without finding an enemy who has the exact color pallette as the enemy you were just facing, but deals one-thousand times more damage for some reason.  And that's not an exaggeration.  There are enemies almost immediately adjacent to areas you are properly leveled to be in who can one-hit you.  You have no way of knowing this or how to tell them apart.			",112,16,0,22,3,0,14

												I know it's not good to transfer one's initial frustration into a review, but I'm at a complete loss about this game. Either I've grown too old and casual for such games, or there's something wrong about it.Its technically openworldish nature goes in stark contrast with limits and shackles pushed onto you in such a strict manner that it simply feels shocking. Yes, there are no corridors and no narrow passageways between sky-high rocks, but instead you are still separated from your whereabouts by invisible walls of creatures way beyond your level, prices way beyond your possible earnings, and quests way beyond your capabilities - even if you are exactly where you are supposed to be gameplay-wise and story-wise. In RPGs of the kind, I usually act alone in the wilderness, learning stuff, training myself, exploring locations and occasionally going to towns for some quests and business. That gives me the feeling of freedom I need and keeps me comfortably independent from my surroundings. To keep things simple, I'll just say that nothing of this is possible in Risen, and I feel very frustrated about it. One of the most painful limitations for me is the inability to develop the character by means of practice. To learn skills and advance your stats, you must get training from other people. To get training from people, you need money. To get money, you need to fulfill quests. To fulfill quests, you need... to learn skills and advance your stats. I must say, I became tired of running in such circles.Maybe it's all personal, and maybe I'm overestimating some stuff, because I'm going unusually emotional about writing this review, but at the moment I don't feel like I want to continue this game.

												I should've listened to my skepticism, considering this game was made by the same developers that made Gothic series. This game is exactly like the Gothic games, except in slightly better graphics. Tedious menial tasks such as harvesting, collecting, and finding n number of some item are back again. No story hook whatsoever. It's just a random island your character finds himself in after being washed ashore. To add to this, the character's walking speed is very slow and the map isn't detailed enough and shows no landmarks, making exploration a real chore.There are a lot of items to find and the combat is semi-decent, but nothing in this game really stands out. Everything has been done before by other RPGs and done better.Some of the dialogue is not bad and can be kind of witty, but some of the voice acting isn't all that great, especially the main character, who hardly puts any emotion in anything he says, and this is coming from someone who is rarely ever picky about voice acting in games.Some NPC and enemy A.I. is a bit strange too. I got into the arrogant guard captain's house and stole stuff from his treasure chest right in front of him and he did not bust an eyelid. I then took a mug of beer from his table and he got all pissy at me all of a sudden. Another enemy was doing a decent job stopping a few feet away from me, letting me shoot them with a bow, then to chase me for a few steps, and to repeat the same procedure till he was dead.If you liked Gothic games, you'll probably like this one too, but it's way too slow paced for me personally. The most fun I got from this was when I decided to stop doing any quests and to simply mess around. Piranha Bytes just keep rehashing the same old boring formula in every single game, and until they make something new and different, I don't think I'll be buying any more of their games.

												Bought this game on sale and I still regretted it. Battles are very frustrating and are more like fencing than actual combat. That said, when being ganged up on, big surprise, you find yourself dying very quickly. The story is pretty blah and the things often get confusing so guides are a must. Creatures spawn in predictable areas and patterns, annoyingly so. Some redeeming qualities are some unique magical effects and a protagonist that talks, but that's really about it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game on sale for $2.50 and have actually played through it once as a ""Mage"" It was an entertaining game for a bit and had some funny moments. The protaganist is wafer thin with no back story and the fact that you wake up on a beach with zero skill and no past or abilty to ""build"" a character from the start is pretty frustrating.Be prepared to be frustrated and literally die dozens of time over and over again because your character sucks. I felt like I was always behind the curve on skills even by end game. The fact that there is no passive regen of health or mana is a P.I.T.A. mostly because you will wasting time eating 15 fried meat inbetween fights. The magic system is pretty shallow but it does offer some convenience in later chapters, i.e. ""Levitate"" and ""Nautilus"" (which allows you to ""scout"" enemies with out being attacked) I acctually started a second play through focused on bow and using the console ""made"" a character from the get go to see what it felt like to actually have some defination in the gameplay from the start though I won't be finishing that playthrough...ever.There are several bugs in this game such as getting stuck on ledges, jumping through the roofs of caves and quests not being able to be completed. Some skills do not function properly such as bow draw speed and the combat animations are clunky. Lastly an unbelievably anticlimactic final boss fight makes you say to yourself...thank the Gods that's over.This game was some amount fun and chuckles for $2.50; not to mention some wasted time but other than that I wouldn't recommend it. Unless you are the particular sort that likes this kind of thing.			",32,5,0,10,0,0,2

												Tried recently and quite the... boredom. Could not get past the atrociously uninteresting combat. And I survived other aspects of the early game, with some difficulty, such as the tutorial/onboarding, asking me to pick up a makeshift club or stick among the many wooden debris of a capsized ship which had washed ashore... only to find out none of the objects lying around were  available for pickup but ONE branch out of a dead trunk quite the trouble to find. Or that female companion who survived alongside my character, half dressed, on a jungle-covered island full of wild animals, who could not be bothered to find herself a stick and would rely on me taking her to ""safety"", only to ask to be left alone while I should just continue my journey, barely a few steps from the crash site. The game is a bit old, but... really? Just how ancient is that trope?Anyways, disregarding that with your best effort, you are then left with click-click-click based combat with frustratingly unresponsive robotic attack animations.It's certainly amazingly hard to make a game, even more so a good one from beginning to end, but the design decisions behind that experience seriously lacked situational common sense and gameplay fun.

												A plodding RPG that'd be quite good if it wasn't for it's shocking back-and-forth slow pace and a phobia to 'lewt'. The open-world nature of the island you're ship-wrecked on does lend itself to bouts of exploration and it's easy to disappear off the beaten track when something sparks your curiosity. A mountain of side-quests and above average combat will take your mind off the shallow crafting system and keep you busy but careful who you align with - annoyingly, your class/skills can be affected by the path you choose.

												Do you think Skyrim is too good for you? Do you think The Witcher has too many positive attributes for you tastes? Think Dragon Age may be too much on the ""enjoyable"" side of the spectrum for you liking? Do you prefer poorly designed, unenjoyable games?Oh, you know what the punchline is. But no, actually, this is not a set up to recommend Risen to masochistic people who don't like enjoyability; that would be too generous. This game is one of the most baffling, unexplainably anti-gaming experiences I've ever had. This is the kind of game you use as an indoctrination tool to convince people that gaming is unhealthy. Risen can convince you that games are evil.Now, I haven't spent 18 hours in this game for nothing. I really, really hoped this game would be interesting. Open world RPG gameplay based on exploration, with a sufficiently intriguing main plot but enough diversity to allow you to carve your own paths, is totally up my alley. The plot of this game looked sinister and oblique enough to pique my interesting, the scenery looked pleasant and the musical score sounded beautiful. The positive attributes end there.Right off the bad, you realise this game is every bit as ""open world"" as Elvis Presley was an octopus. You're presented with plenty of interesting opportunities, but they're all locked off behind unbeatable enemies. The game forces you into the trodden path in the most disappointing way possible: by killing you off instantaneously if you dare to go out of bounds.Before you even get to experience some of the gameplay, you're trampled by the uncaring hooves of the Plot. And therein lies about 90% of the game: walking around and talking to people. You are literally LOCKED inside a town and forced to do lots of talking and lots of walking before you can get to see anything else. You learn here that every action has a consequence: in other words, you're forced to either join one faction or the other. You're led to make some very tough moral decisions; in other words, you do horrible things to horrible people, or you do horrible things to OTHER horrible people. And that's how you're going to spend precious hours of your life and precious dollars (or whatever you local currency is) off your pocket.After that gruelling process, though, you finally get to go outside, and test the skills and the inventory you amassed with great difficulty. What awaits you outside is a battle system that... well, I don't mean to say that it is botched, but... It is botched. Frankly, the combat in this game is one of the most absurd things I've EVER seen in gaming. There's no tactics involved. There's no skills being tested. Nothing. Yes, you have your basic commands (move, attack, defend, etc.) and some extra commands you learn through training (parrying, disarming your enemies, etc.), but the combat ignores that entirely. For starters, EVERY enemy in this game attacks faster than you. And I mean EVERY enemy, including the very first creatures you see. Every time you try to attack, your enemy can attack and hit you instead. This is not something you can just upgrade, no: every single attack in this game boils down to a matter of luck. Also, after being hit, your enemies can INSTANTLY attack you back. There is zero recovery time for your enemies, and stunning them is beyond the game's vocabulary. Also, they can defend themselves indefinitely against any attack. Mostly you can also defend indefinitely, but some stronger enemies can stun you and kill you regardless of defense (this is what makes some of the enemies unbeatable). You think, maybe, that you can defend from your enemy's attack, and use their down time to strike back, but no. They have zero recovery time, remember? You think maybe you can dodge them instead, but no. That doesn't work either. Fighting in this game boils down to a single process: first, you defend. Then, you let go of your defense, and HOPE the enemy doesn't attack you. Then, you attack, and HOPE the attack lands. Then, you immediately defend. If you're feeling adventurous, you can try a second, stronger attack, but again, you have to hope. Finally, you defend again. Repeat. THIS is the combat. We're not talking about difficulty here. We're not talking about combat that is designed to be hard, after all, to insinuate this system was ""designed"" is an insult to the art of game design to begin with. We're talking about a combat system made by people who never played a decent game in their life. To be successful in a one-to-one battle consists of saving and loading the game over and over. It's a matter of patience, but at least it's doable, you know, it's playable. For that reason, most of the time, the game pits you against three or four enemies simultaneously.Now here is where the whole thing utterly falls apart. Fighting more than one enemy multiplies all of the problems. ALL the enemies are entirely transparent to each other's attacks; you can get hit by an enemy striking THROUGH another enemy standing between you and it. As long as you're holding the defense button, the character will ""lock"" onto the enemy in front of you, but an enemy standing slightly to the side can strike and hit you; but to lock onto a different enemy, you have to move your mouse SO far that you'll need three or four additional desks around you. Often, the character will be defending an enemy that is standing yards away from you, while one that's right next to you will successfully hit you, only because you were too slow dragging your mouse all the way to the Moon so you could lock onto him. Again, not only the enemy you're locked to can successfully hit you even if they attack you AFTER you started your own attacks, the other enemies around you can hit you as well, so the luck factor is multiplied. EVERY fight in this game is decided entirely by the random number generator and by saving/loading.You think that you can tilt the odds in your favour by gaining levels and improving your inventory. Theoretically yes, but then we bump into another problem: the game is EXTRAORDINARILY STINGY. Deafeating even the hardest enemies will give you negligible experience boosts. Most of the levelling up you'll get from this game will be completing quests, which as has been said, boils down mostly to walking and talking. You'll get more experience talking than fighting. The same is true for money: the enemy drops are entirely worthless, as well as most items you find. And don't think that you can haggle for prices or look for better merchants: everyone pays exactly the same prices for everything. And trust me, you'll need money. The levels you get give you learning points, which must be invested in the skills you want by training with people. To train, you need to spend money, and it ain't cheap. But don't think you can just spend your hard earned money in the skills you so desperately need, no: in this game, many of the obligatory quests can ONLY be completed by spending money. But even if you do improve your skills, this does not mitigate the luck factor from the battles; it will just make them last a little shorter.All of that just to reach some new area and advance the plot. Eventually the fights started to become entirely unavoidable, endless, repetitive, and of course, entirely luck based. I was playing just to justify the money I spent on it, but even that was becoming too gruesome. I was needlessly torturing myself for a game that wasn't worth it. Why should I play this instead of, say, The Witcher? Or Dragon Age? Or just Skyrim again? There's no point. There are many, many more things that are awfully botched in this game, but this review would go on forever. No wonder this game is so cheap and always on sale, but don't be fooled by it. Save your money and your time for a good game.18 hours...			",78,6,4,12,14,0,10

												Where do I start with a game like this?I guess the first thing to do is denounce any notion that this is an open-world game. After you break out of the linear tutorial, you can't exactly go out and do your own thing. High-level monsters litter all but a select few paths, and the only way to figure out whether or not you can pass is to fight these monsters (and surely get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked).So, of the few paths you can take, you'll end up in one town or another, with different factions, altough really, they're all the same: masculine-looking people who hate you. Almost EVERY person you meet is a total ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥ I understand wanting to have a game where you're not instantly likeable, but this is way beyond that. I guess I understand it, though, since a thumbtack has more personality than whoever the hell you play as. He's boring, he's constantly finding ways to♥♥♥♥♥♥people off, and his voice acting is poorly-delivered.Shaping and growing your one-dimensional protagist is no fun either. EVERYTHING in this game can kick your♥♥♥♥♥ No matter how decent the combat is, if you end up fighting a group of more than two enemies, even if they're weaker, you're screwed. And for how good the combat is, you can't easily heal during battle, so if you don't land your blows right away, you're dead. If you wander off into the woods and into a pack of wolves, they'll chase you and kill you.So, that limits your area of fun to the towns. Not only do people hate you and constantly crap on you, but the few quests you can actually figure out how to get are your simple MMO ""get me 50 of something"" or ""go here and kill this thing"" quests. Not to mention there are no landmarks, waypoints, or any other mechanics to help you find the places these people want you to go. Why should I bother finding these quest locations if I'm just gonna get wrecked by a camp of gnomes or a wolf that happened to be guarding the tracks?So, you can't do quests. Maybe you can go out adventuring on your own somewhere? Hah! Your character is about as devoid of adventuring skills as you are. You know nothing when you begin, and it's not readily apparent *how* you learn skills. When I tell my character to use a chest, he looks at it and goes, ""Wish I knew how to pick locks."" When I try to use a cauldron, he goes ""I don't know how to use that."" When I try to use an anvil or a grindstone he goes ""I'm not a smith.""So, you can't do anything in this game. Quests are boring, and even when you try to take them on you're greeted with either failure and defeat or the opportunity to get chewed out by complete♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥delivering very bad dialogue. I've put about 5 hours into this game and I don't know how to improve my skills. So I'm stuck in an endless cycle of disappointment. This game isn't even fun in the ""it kicks your♥♥♥♥♥quot; kind of way. It's not fun in any way. Sure, the graphics are pretty and the music is excellent, but really, that does nothing to save this game. Risen is terrible. Don't waste your money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In fact, it seriously flirts around the idea of being 'Gothic' worthy, but then it collapses under a pile of badly written fetch quests that exist throughout most of the campaign, and an even more tasteless plot. If that wasn't enough already, the devastated remains of said tortured game get utterly crushed by a gigantic anvil: The horrible final boss fight --basically it's a subpar Crash Bandicoot-esque boss arena--, and thus, leading to an abrupt ending that does not make up for the time you've dedicated in the whole process.Tl;dr.: +1 Strength +1 Strength +1 Strength +1 Dexterity +4 Wisdom +4 Wisdom +4 Wisdom +4 Wisdom +4 Wisdom +3 Wisdom +3 Wisdom +4 Wisdom +5 Strength +10 Experience + 1 Dexterity4/8			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pretty darned awful TBH. Couldn't stomach it for more than about 5 minutes. Combat is about as unintuitive as possible: You get your weapon, you then have to go into your bag to equip it, then click middle mouse to draw it. Any time anyone speaks to you, it's back on your back or sheathed or whatever. Your top speed is a leisurely stroll & you cannot dodge, at least not without doing some research to find out where they've hidden it. I waited over 2 hours for this? Oh dear god no. Back to Kingdoms of Amalur I fear. This is just full of fetid, pasty fail.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game had an MMO feel to it as far as the quests and such, but it really left a lot to be desired. There was no real direction when it came to doing quests, leaving you stumbling around wondering what to do next. I never made it out of the first main questing area because of this. Overall, it seems like it has potential if you can get past the frustration of not knowing what to do. I don't think I'll be trying it again though.			",77,15,0,5,11,0,2

												I like this game, but it frustrated me more than any other game. The story is entertaining enough, but I cannot stand the combat. Because early game weapons and armour are all but useless, everything kills you in a couple of hits, and it takes a lot of hits to kill opponents. This would not be a problem, but the hit boxes and dodging system are crap. Even though I have not even completed chapter 1, I would not recommend this game due to the faulty combat system.

												The game is pretty good at the beginning.  I enjoyed the scenery, game development and how the game progressed.  Then I started nearing the end.  You have to jump on different ledges in various caverns to progress.  The game fell apart.  I was saving before every jump because I wasn't sure if the game would glitch or not.  Then the levels became convoluted and confusing with having to go back and forth to find something that may or may not have been there.  The fun aspect of the game became frustrating.  If the glitches were fixed and maybe a map that would be created as you explore (instead of not-exsisting for some areas) it would be nice.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not for me, its like how some people play Bethesda RPGs. Constantly saving in fear of doing something wrong and constantly reloading is not how I want to play games... Graphics are fine, Audio is nice. Combat is clunky (as f*ck)... I believe it's a port from console. Combat Is also very hard even on easy*(They say it gets better... but guess what I can't get there) and because of me not saving and reloading based on results the story can't go any further cause I attacked some one (quest character) who pulled there weapon on me for walking into there ""house""... Not for me. Maybe you like to play inside a video games menu.Based on measly 3 hr game play. And it has not grabbed me enough to try harder or any longer.Also no wiki pages that really help with anything like game mechanics, So that I can even learn what I've done wrong or right.

												The game has decent potential, but as you progress through the game you learn that its one big tedious mess.  There is no reward system in the sense that you are actually growing as a character in the spiritual sense and also the physical sense that you have to play about 15 hours before you can get your hands on or afford any new armor.  Even that its not even worth it.  The combat is clunky also.			",111,19,10,21,6,1,7

												From what I could play, the game is fine. Except for the mission bugs making the game impossible to complete.I heard of an unofficial patch 1.3 but too late, as my current playthrough is still blocked after applying it, I might restart my game one day.In short, I went with the Don route, until I thought it was a better idea to ""backstab"" him and keep loot, then go to the monastery. More loot, more XP, more skills, why the hell not?Then you game become unplayable since I can't go and talk to a specific person because guards don't let me through.End of playthrough, so don't do that, either choose the monastery or the Don.

												This game felt weird, the combat is wonky, to the point that at end game I lost ~75% hit points against a mob that I could one hit. EVERY mob in this game has the dexterity, dodgy-ness, and deflection skills of a ballerina and ninja love-child who was trained from birth in the art fencing.The beginning of the game was entirely too hard, and grindy, I was without even simple armor for the first 25% of the game, then once you get through that, the loot seems to just fall on you at a rediculous rate.The voice actors all sounded like they were experiencing the worst hangover of their lives whilst reading their lines. This really broke the immersion and crippled what could have been an incredibly well done story.The graphics were okay and the scenery was pretty, but there was this super annoying ""grainy"" overlay that covered everything, that got old fast.Overall, playing this game felt like a chore. 3/10 Buyer beware, even on sale.

												What can I say? It's basically Gothic 1, just with some better Graphics. The main problem I have with this game is, that it's a little bit bugged which ain't much of a problem. Personally this game didn't caught my attention, but rather left me frustrated about the fact that if I get knocked out by a NPC, my Hero throws away his weapons and I have to search them again (IF you find them...). Also the combat system is kinda weird, because it locks onto enemies, but yet you can accidently aim at another enemy, which is in a battle of at least 3 people or so, a bit annoying. Also it seemed to me, that every enemy was way stronger than I was and killed me with 3 hits or so. Blocking didn't do the trick sometimes as well. The map isn't really helpful either or the journal for that matter. It shows you where some people are, but sometimes it didn't said where I would have to go, meaning I have to find my way by simple guessing, to complete a quest. I do not recommend this game, because it didn't entertained me or caught my attention long enough to oversee the flaws this game has.			",331,78,4,32,22,3,31

Posted: December 3, 2016
												Foremost a caveat: This review is highly subjective and doesn't analyze flaws in the combat rules or the character levelling system as some other very detailed reviews do it. I may have given up too early and haven't seen much of the game. Maybe I will revisit it eventually, but my own experience hasn't been good. It could be due to a non-matching personal taste.Compared to my first impressions with the awesome games ""Gothic II: Gold Edition"" and ""Gothic"", during the first few hours I've tried out ""Risen"", I've felt turned off due to various factors.The graphics are more complex than in the Gothic games. Okay. For example, there is deep underwood you can move through in some places, but which blocks your view completely. It complicates exploration, and often you bump into impassable vegetation or rocks directly behind a section where you could move through. And no way to climb up or explore more freely.Everything is too colorful and cartoonish. Giant moths? Urgh! Worst of all, the player and NPC animations during conversation and movement are very clunky. Hard to imagine that I would want to move around (and fight!) with such clunky animations for a long time. I cannot enjoy the silly gestures during conversation. It's like watching a movie with bad actors.The open world feeling has been severely restricted already near the starting location,  forcing you to follow one narrow and almost safe path leading to NPCs that don't manage to raise your interest. Not with what they do and not with what they tell you. Shrug. The linear story forces you to talk to them about some bits only and staying vague. Just a few steps into the swamp, powerful enemies lurk. So near to those NPCs. It doesn't matter to me that some highly experienced players of Risen may be able to kill them early in half an hour or a longer battle. You are not expected to do that at that point. Just as in the Gothic games, you don't know how strong an enemy is and what it takes to defeat it. Or you try to explore more of the limited paths and stumble into a cave or another dungeon that is not for you yet. Yeah, understood, avoid those places and return to errand boy duties.So, another game where you build up meta-gaming knowledge by trial and error, save and reload, again and again. The next time you know where to go, when to do it, how long to save skills points and when to spend them on which skills. Early on I could kill a couple of early wolves, sting rats, giant moths and huge birds with the help of a shield I found, and with considerable effort trying to do damage to them while blocking their attacks, but combat already seemed very repetitive and tedious. I guess I'm supposed to ignore combat for an unknown time and gain experience points with non-combat tasks, and yet one early task involves fighting some nasty worm.To me it seems it might be possible to have some fun with Risen, if one can live with the clunky animations and combat mechanics and build up enough meta-gaming knowledge to know where to go first. If only the story managed to pull you in. It hasn't done that for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

RISENA fairly shallow and flawed third-person action RPG.Rating 4/10Risen came out in 2009 around the same time as Dragon Age and in comparison it looks and plays like a game that should have been released in 2003. For an RPG it gets a lot of the basics wrong, there is very little in the way of character creation or character choice. You play an uninteresting potato head looking protagonist with no back-story or motivations other than you've been ship wrecked on an island in an unknown world. There are three different ways of playing your character, as a mage, warrior or hunter. You are able to level up various skills such as strength or sword fighting through training that can be purchased from various NPCs around the island. It's incredibly simplistic and offers no real choice.The NPCs littered around the island in small limited number of locations are lifeless and bland. The voice actors sound as though they have no interest and everything is delivered monotone which is strange considering the vast talent they've arranged for the voice actors such as Andy Serkis and Lena Headey. It also doesn't help that the character models look awful like they've come from a game made in the early 2000s. I struggle to think of a single interesting character in the game and even the characters with some promise like Patty have woeful looking models which undermine the character. Combat is a clunky and frustrating experience, based on timing and luck. Enemies enter into attack cycles, you have to block until they've finished their cycle and it turns into a repetitive and boring game of waiting. When there are three or more enemies it becomes quite hard as every hit you take breaks your current attack and being hit from all sides gives you very little option other than running away. Whilst combat becomes easier as the game progresses it still remains an incredibly frustrating experience.The menu and item system seem to have been an after thought. There is no limit on how much you can carry, at all, meaning I was running around carrying 500 heavy weapons. With no inventory limits it means you give little thought to what you loot as you can take everything. More often than not I just spammed the loot button on enemy bodies without bothering to check what they had. Added to this the serious lack of weapons and armour, I came across 4 sets of armour during the game and you don't get the first set of armour until at least 7 or 8 hours into the game. There is also no reason for half the items you pick up, food and frying pans are all meaningless after the first few hours. All you need are potions are spells and the small number of items needed to make them.There are some positives, the environment looks pretty good with a great Island setting and the story moves along a fairly quick pace with a couple of great side quests. However it's not enough to make up for all the games flaws which outweigh what little good there is.			",251,59,8,29,21,2,31

												Please don't let the 77 Metascore fool you. This game is very underwhelming. You will dredge through the game, not knowing at any time what is really going on, while being swarmed by knee-high monsters that any RPG would rate as cannon fodder. but not in Risen. In Risen, you will fight for countless hours against pathetic, poorly-designed enemies while using a mind numbing combat system. If the later installments of this game have improved, I wouldn't know. I invested enough time into this game to actually write a review and downvote it, and I almost never go out of my way to not recommend a game. Please, save yourself the wasted time. Play any Elder Scrolls game, or Dragon Age, or even go old school and play Baldur's Gate or something.			",28,2,0,19,1,0,11

												Don't buy this expecting an easy or fair game.  The combat is pretty bad and and you will get killed in 2-3 hits while it takes you 15+ to kill anything.  Movement speed is slow and it's pretty much impossible to level up. Enemies are pretty easy to kill 1v1 and almost impossible to kill in groups unless you find some way to exploit the terrain.  Pretty much all the enemies are in groups.  The graphics are good and the environments are good.  I'm going to keep playing and hope it begins to blow less♥♥♥♥♥but I'm not counting on it.

												Risen is an open world third person rpg which has you running around a small island with some caves and some enemies and one major town. You will be doing several fetch quests and you will be fighting a very limited variety of enemies for most of the game. I did not find the fighting system to be fun.You can't leave the island or go in the water.After spending 70 + hours in this game, I've decided that this experience ends up feeling like a low budget, boring, extremely limited, buggy, and repetitive third class waste of time.Lots of weed use though, that's a unique plus.The entire Elder Scrolls series does this game style on a MUCH more interesting and larger scale; there is no point in wasting time here in this basic world of Risen when you can spend your time in a much better and far more impressive world such as any of the Elder Scrolls series. It just makes sense to spend your free time playing the games that have done this gameplay concept better.There are many bugs too that I ran into often.Here are some of the bugs I have come across:

I found the story and the dialogue and the quests and the music all boring.  I also don't like the fact that fighting is so difficult, I understand that this could also be a very positive thing challenge-wise, but I just got frustrated, because I'm a bit OCD when it comes to wolves on my path, I want them out of my way no matter what.  I understand I am to leave stronger enemies alone, to save them for later. I can't do that. There's really nothing abut the game that makes me want to try and just finish it.No. Just...no.

												Risen is an RPG that continues to follows the same theme as the Gothic series. The story is generic high fantasy with forgettable characters with even more forgettable quest and storyline. Like most of Piranha Byte's work in this genre, the combat is abysmally bad. Risen would've been at the very least acceptable if it wasn't such an unnecessarily long winded and bug ridden game. Risen is chock full of bugs, many of which will break quest line. I personally couldn't finish this game without the use of console commands to fix certain quests. The game becomes an absolute cluster poop once you hit the volcano mid game as important quest npc's get stuck or the lever that was suppose to open gates stopped working. Console commands can fix some of these issues, but the customer shouldn't have to resort to cheats to proceed in a video game.I can only think of one other RPG with combat that is even worse than Risen and that is Gothic 1. Coincidentally that was also made by Piranha Bytes. The combat in Risen is reliant on a very bad target locking system; it locks on the closest target, and you cannot change targets manually. This means that if a enemies groups up on you, you are going to be swinging at the air as the bull poop lock-on system wildly changes targets automatically. You will then proceed to die as enemies stun-lock you in to oblivion.The game store page indicates that this game is 60 hours of game play, which is mostly correct if you consider that 40 of those hours are spent wandering aimlessly to find the next place to turn in your quest. The directions in the dialogue are outright terrible and the lack luster quest marker made the questing even more tedious and boring. Now compound that with the fact that Risen is comprised of mostly fetch quests and you have a recipe for one of the most boring RPG experience ever. Risen is basically Dark Souls with none of the awesome or the refinement in game-play.			",2378,1002,91,291,305,24,411

												If you enjoyed the Elder Scrolls series, this is a game for you.  I'd say the combat is mediocre and only half the enemies are challenging (then again I played it on Normal difficulty because I'm soft haha).  I'd recommend Hard difficulty if this isn't your first open world RPG. The protagonist has next to no background or personality, except when he's being sarcastic.  His sarcasm is quite funny, but hopefully whenever I get around to playing Risen 2 they will consider adding more depth to the main character. A few things I would have changed is adding bosses in some of the ruins/dungeons you explore.  The only actual boss was the final one (which was slightly disappointing in terms of mechanics, but visually it was badass).  The ability to forge not just weapons, but chest and head equipment would have been nice to have.  If there was a way to go about that, I didn't discover it.  My final problem was the auto-targetting feature which would often get you killed when fighting off a mob of enemies at once.  You do get used to it, but it was frustrating every so often.Overall i thoroughly enjoyed my first playthrough. Story is the most important aspect of an RPG for me, and Risen delivered.  The first half of the game was a little slow, but it was building up the backstory of the island and it's inhabitants.  The second half of the game is when the plot thickens.  I enjoyed the lore and look forward to what the devs accomplished with Risen 2.			",234,75,3,30,11,2,13

												Another open world, Gothic/Two Worlds lookalike. As you get stranded on an island filled with emerging old crypts and temples, you work your way through the different hierachies and choose the path you wish. Although they all give about the same outcome, the characters/skills variety are worth messing around with. Loyalty or thievery, that is the question that most struggle with in this game. A well made world filled with people and animals of all shapes/sizes. Enjoy a walk through the depths of the swaps, the grassy hills of the monastery or join the militia/Thieves. 10/10 for ingenuety and open world. Choices affect you the right way in here.

												This is a good 3rd-person RPG. It's quite immersive and you can really get sucked into the events going on and interactions in town. It's a fully open world and you're free to explore at your leisure. I'm in about 50 hours and I'm about halfway through. My only gripe is the combat system, which can be a bit cumbersome to fight.

												I don't know how I missed this one! Despite being one of THE BEST RPGs I've played in recent years, it still has that same old Deep Silver trademark bugginess. You'll have to restart often as the graphics engine will randomly crash, while everything else keeps going (conversations, HUD, music etc). But you know what?? It's worth it, I'm not saying that this is forgiveable by any means, beacause it isn't, but give it a chance at least. Who knows, maybe five years on, they'll patch it. Yeah, right.

What I got instead was a surprising robust combat system, snappy dialogue, and a passable if not incredible story that has multiple paths and factions to choose from. Do I recommend this game?

I definitely recommend Risen as a game to play. Personally, the 25 hours I've spent playing this game have been perfect,no real speedbumps to my enjoyment.There are a few bugs, which are easily fixed: If you cant see quests, change your resolution to a different one(aspect ratio) and change it back.

												A decent game that caters to the likes of any RPG fan. You literally began the game in rags and work your way up to becoming a formidible warrior. It's a challenge at first as everything can either one-hit you or two-hit you. On the small chance that you're near a group of potential allies, you can lead anything attacking you towards them and they'll join in the battle, presuming you have your weapons sheathed, lest they try to kill you as well. With its extraordinary scenery, gripping storyline (which, though a mystery at first, is revealed in time), and engaging combat, Risen is well worth the purchase.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fairly decent adventure game with open world. The difficulty curve is fairly tough at the beginning as the world doesn't scale much. So you struggle at the beginning but it gets easier as your character gets stronger (be prepared to save and load a LOT).  It is fun though, and has interesting plot. Although you can build your character however you like ""to a degree,"" plot directly prevents you from doing some skill combinations. (For example, some skills can only be taught by some people who are enemies of other people who teach other skills). As a result, sides you choose will significantly impact your play style. (Some things you can work around a bit, others not so much). As such, the world, although fairly open, feels like a world with it's own limitations... not arbitrary limitations, but the world feels solid. I suggest playing it.			",291,88,1,54,63,4,66

Purchased for under £5 and definitly got my moneys worth.if you have spare time and there is no other RPG/action games out there calling for your attention, you will not be dissapointed.

												Do you enjoy RPGs? Do you like becoming one with your character? Did you love Gothic I and II, but you were dissapointed by Gothic III? Then this game is meant for you. Risen has all the elements we loved from Gothic 1 (lockpicking minigame, combat evolution as you level up your sword-fighting skill, etc.) with upgraded graphics and sick optimization. You can run this game on a 7 year old machine no problem. Too bad the story is always the same, regardless what your choices were. So far, I've played this for 27 hours and I must say, I've enjoyed all of them. I reccomend it to anyone who likes Gothic series. It will bring back some old memories and nostalgia, as it did to me.			",53,2,0,7,1,0,1

												Almost at 40 hours at the time I've written this review and I know that I could easily get another 10+ hours out of it. I find this game refreshing. Although it's a bit older, it has some qualities that new games could take a lesson from. There's a lot of optional ways to play the game: Optional quests, the way your character develops both in skills and via the story, and the way you interact with different people all shape the game you're playing.If you're into games of the Elder Scrolls series then you'll most likely enjoy this. Be warned though, it's a little tougher than those games! Once you become used to the combat and grow with experience you will begin to enjoy the difficulty of the game and at the same time you'll curse it once you're killed in one hit...Thank you auto-save!

												Amazing game, combat is engaging and challenging, make a wrong move and you're going to die. I'm liking the story and love the main character, he's just some guy who snuck on the wrong boat and is now casted into this mess. Along with that the island is very pretty and lovely to explore. Has become one of my favorite RPGs and I certainly recommend it.			",660,246,25,84,80,6,78

												Many consider Risen to be the true Gothic 3, and it's easy to see why. The game looks beautiful, plays well, and integrates many concepts from the Gothic games (multiple factions, all with good and evil sides, a focus on realism, tricky combat, and strong characters) all without the bugs that plagued the later entries in the series.Worth a play if you've finished Gothic 2 and want more of the same, only shinier.

												I played the game because I was a Gothic fan, my review will be based on that assumption. You are still a nameless hero and there are some key areas that shine in this game in relation to Gothic, while others fail to compare to what I found to be the best RPG of its time.PROSThe world is vastly open and completely explorable, there are a number of things to collect for alchelmy, smithing, and food preparation; the puzzles are a good balance of challenging yet not impossible; you're character is yours: meaning just because you like bows doesn't mean you are limitied to them you can dabble where you like. Some additonal pros are the ability to use two handed weapons as one handers with enough skill and CONSMoney is easily found and little needed. Skill points quickly becaome irrelevant, you don't need to level most things and frankly theres not a lot to level up anyway. Choices for guild are very limited: Don or Inquisition with little difference between the two.  THe game is significantly shorter then Gothic. Little to no replay value.In conclusion, Risen is a decent game, and I did enjoy playing it; however it is no where near as good as the Gothic series. I would recommend that you play this first and then work your way up the Gothic series, so your games get better as you go.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												From what appears to be a simple RPG at the outset to a game with hidden depth and maturity as you progress. Combat seems like many other hack and slash games but overlies interactions with characters, puzzle quests and a storyline which keeps the pace of the game up and brings ouy up to side quests etc. An easy going RPG with a great deal more depth and reward than is initially apparent.

												If you like RPGs and Gothic 1/2, then you must play this. It's Gothic 1's story combined with gameplay of Gothic 2. Memorable characters on a huge detailed island with no loading (I'm looking at you Skyrim). The only negative about this game is the combat that takes some time to get used to. It's like Dark Souls minus the rolling around.			",124,17,2,12,14,1,7

												The game actually feels like a weird new-gen low-budget remake of Gothic II. It has similar premise, same plot hooks, same locations, same sound samples, same background music, same monsters, same animations, same mechanics, same atmosphere, same NPCs, same quests and dozens, dozens of references!This, though, is not entirely a bad point. If you haven't ever touched Gothic series before, the game is pure fun for hardcore wilderness exploration and NPC trolling. If you have - rejoice in nostalgia and long-asked-for innovations, like crafting, aiming, self-shielding and more. (What? Gothic 3? There is no such game. Shut up.)All in all, it has its flaws (weird dialog trees, sadly linear plot, overall shoddiness, some bugs, etc.) and gets quite dull closer to the ending, but is still worth it for the most part. But come prepared: there is an amazing guide out there that points out most of gameplay quirks that make people frustrated, sad and puzzled; you should probably read that before buying and certainly - before playing.

												reminds me a little bit of Drakkhen: Order of the Flame. the world building and quests are good, and the environment is exciting to explore, but quest objectives aren't always all that clear. i might just be dumb, but i spent a lot of time going in circles. combat isn't anything new, and it's pretty difficult -- i tried making a spellsword and it worked out pretty well.one feature i really like is the way you obtain skills. instead of automatically being alloted skill points to distribute, you have to do quests/interact with NPCs in order to train from them. if you want to learn how to lockpick, you can talk to a blacksmith and he'll eventually share his mechanical skills. if you want to be a better archer, you need to find someone who knows that kind of combat (a hunter in the wilderness?). along the same lines, you don't start out with a map -- you have to find one. and you can even hire a cartographer to draw you a more detailed one. features like this (that newer RPGs usually lack) add a nice layer of immersion, but also add a lot of difficulty and process to simple things. fun if you like challenging exploration, but i'd be prepared to be frustrated at least sometimes.

												The best of the Risen series, sticking closely to the old-fashioned conventions of RPG -- the later games fell apart where gameplay is concerned, despite improved graphics, which just shows that graphics alone don't make a game.  This one may look a little low-res to modern players but the story pulls you in and the combat is very nearly ""good"", and best of all there is no mention of ""voodoo pirates"".  Has its faults, perhaps more than average, but compared to the later editions seems very nearly perfect.  Some minor choices are offered but these do not alter the overal game outcome in any way whatsoever.  Best played before the later versions, as often it's hard to come back to an earlier stage where the graphics aren't so good.  Dialogue is all over the place, as you'd expect when it isn't recorded sequentially, but in character sessions.  Has good replay value, which is always the mark of a better-than-average game.One gripe: there are no ""achievements"" to be had, despite this being stipulated in some of the hype blurb.  Not that these are any real loss -- in the other two games, these are simply things you'd achieve while playing the game anyway, so they're valueless.  Perhaps these will come later?  Oh, and it doesn't cloud save either, so if you need to switch between pcs, or a hi-spec laptop, to play, you'll have to pop the savegame folder onto a flashdrive and transfer manually.  I remember when that was considered a smart move, and not a tedious chore...!!			",28,7,0,16,22,1,13

												If you liked the Gothic Series, this Game will serve your RPG needs. It's simply another Gothic Game, just with a newer look, a new hero and a new Story. But the feeling is the same. It has a big Island to discover, two factions to side with and lots and lots of Quests. The thing I really like about Risen (and I liked about the Gothic Games) is the fact, that you have to start as a weak guy, that can't handle too many or too strong enemies, and that you have to earn a lot of experience to get stronger and better. Risen is a game for those who like an open and vibrant world to discover, and the challenges of many different quests.			",130,60,1,26,15,0,12

												Picked this gem up on a Steam sale for $10; worth every penny. It's a Medieval RPG, where in the first five minutes you're a shipwrecked castaway on an island, and all it shows you is how to pick up a stick with your mouse. You have to self-teach yourself everything else from there, and by the end of the game you've gone from a stick-wielding twerp wearing a potato sack to a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-sword toting, fireball throwing badass. And some serious♥♥♥♥♥♥goes down. It's really great.			",271,47,4,50,32,3,46

												Fun game, reminds me a lot of Gothic. your combat ability depends heavily on your armor, gear, and stats, which is tied mainly to the quest chains. combat has some skill to it as well. there is no inventory limit, so grab everything you can find. some bits can be confusing as to what to do next, and some fights can be crazy-difficult. generally if its too hard, then train more skills and equip better gear. with swords, you can use a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sword one-handed once you skill up swords enough, and eventually even 2-handed swords one-handed. the best 'axe' is a hammer witha  +6 to axe skill, but you dont get it till the very end of the main quest. if you see this on sale, then definetly get it. its a fun RPG with at least two 'paths' through the game.

												Fun game and I greatly recommend it.StoryThe story is fun and it's worth checking out on sale. I would advise that you side with the Inqisition over the Don, as the story makes more sense that way and you do the same quests no matter whose side you pick.CombatHard. I died twice to the first Hungry Vulture you fight before I barely managed to kill it, but once you get a hang of the combat it becomes a lot of fun to play. Some enemies like the Saurians have twice your range and can be cheap to fight, but at least once you killed it you know you earned the kill. Even though the combat is skill based, your stats play a large role in how hard fights are and as you level some enemies like the Ghouls with become really easy.OpinionI would say buy this when it goes on sale, if you've looked up Angry Joe's review of the game it's rather biased, and I would say this game is a lot better than he makes it out to be. I would however agree with his opinion on the Risen 2, the game is total crap. Risen is a lot of fun, avoid Risen 2, the combat in that game is compeletly different and is totally stat based and not skill based. Overall though Risen is buy on sale, great game and worth the money. 7/10 if you're into scores			",60,11,0,32,7,3,10

												Games like this makes me wish Steam had a middle option between recommend and not recommending. I liked the exploration part of the game, to a point. But there really isnt much to explore. My game time shows 42.9 hrs. But when I sat down to actually play the game and complete all the quests, it only took me 25 hrs. Which is less then half of the time advertised on the ""About the game"" description below, which boasts over 60 hours. I highly doubt it would take that long to walk every inch of the island.The combat is probably one of, if not the most, unwieldly, buggy, dissapointing systems I've ever encountered. It's hard to get used to. Timing seems everything, tossing the skill of the player aside. Stats seem to speed up the characters actions and damage and not chance to hit which I am thankful for. It wasnt difficult, it was just, annoying.The best part for me was the storyline, and the side stories/quests. That's not to say they were all well written, it was just the best part of the game for me. Theres a side quest ****SPOILERS**** where to have to save a man from nightmares from a certain ring he found. The back story for the rings is awefully close to Lord of the Rings. Just felt generic and out of place for a game that has alot of lore. Just a few items above that irked me one way or another. Now time for the ratings.Graphics : 6/10 - Not great, but not bad. I would go 7 but some of the textures look like they just moved Gothic 3 to an island and said this is Risen.Gameplay : 3/10 - Again, some of the worse controlls for combat ive ever seen. Plus, no way to increase your characters running speed except by scroll. And teleportation only comes about mid way through the game, so travel is slow and tedious. I also dont like using the left mouse button to do everyhting.Story : 7/10 - Not bad here. I enjoyed following the history of the island and some of it's inhabitants. The tie in to the Gothic seiries was a nice touch.Content : 5/10 - Im about even here. What there is to see is great, but the lack of content is disturbing. Also I should note, the only crafting in game thats worth having is Alchemy and Scroll Making. Nothing else is useful to warrent spending points in. Also, I had a hard time leveling. Even with completeing all the quests and the monsters I killed, I only reached level 24. Why? Cause monsters dont respawn. And after all the quests are done, what else can you do to raise your level?Replayability : 0/10 - Once youve beaten it, no reason to replay. the story does have a few alternate choices you can make, but the last few chapters are always the same. Overall Score : 3.5/10 - It's one of those games that probably deserve to be played, but players deserve to be given a better game to play. Again, it's not bad...it just isnt good. Im not sorry I bought it, but Im certianly not happy about it either. Reccomend to buy if on sale.  ",97,17,1,40,16,0,27

 RISEN Review	I have to admit that ive been wrong about Risen in the past and i can say now that Risen is quite an underrated RPG. Its one of those games that growns on you the more you play it, sure can be frustrating at start and quite demanding but you need to have alot of patience and be smart. Risen its an RPG that doesnt hold your hand meaning theres no arrows above your head pointing the goals of the quests, the quest map points you in a general direction and you have to explore for yourself, yes it will take time but its rewarding when you actually find something. As you play this for the first time my advice its to go Inquisition and arm yourself with a Shield and 1h Sword at all times, i know the appeal for a 2h Broadsword or a staff is huge but you will die alot more and learn fire magic asap. Learn the combat tricks like driving your oponent against a wall or use an nearby NPC.GraphicsNot last gen but arent near as bad that you have to gouge out your eyes out with spoons in fact at times they can be quite pleasant.Sound and MusicMusic is great and adds to your imersition into the game while the sound is an hit&miss kind of deal where some NPCs dialoges are quite well writen and performed, others drop your IQ everytime they open their mouths but overall is good.If you endured starpoint gemini 1 dialogues you can endure anything.GameplayNow heres the big elephant in the room and its the reason for most of the hate this game gets. The combat style in this game is NOT for everyone and requires a ton of practise, it's imperative that you have to learn and master your combat moves, spaming atacks will get you nothing but deaths and frustration. Block, roll will be your best friends aside from your shield and armor and get friends with your save&load buttons, you will use them alot. Use your head and tactics, fire an arrow or spell before meele atacks, use an NPC nearby for an extra sword, if the oponent kills you fast comeback later when youre stronger. Master all this and this game is quite rewarding.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												OK, 1st things 1stTHIS IS NOT A GAME FOR A CASUAL GAMER!! Casual gamers will likely die every 30 minutes. Also note it is quite very possible, particulary against certain creatures, that a low level creature will kill a high level player. This game requires a degree of strategy. This is not the kind of rpg where you can just order your attacks to happen 3 moves away from now. Combat is brutal! But, despite all I have said, for those who are willing, this game delivers a rewarding experience. Also, very important to note, at least through out my playthrough, the ""jump to ledge"" worked very little. I would be forced to press ctrl+alt+delete and bring up task manager and start up the game again. As frustrating as this is there is away around it (however, depending which of the 3 career paths you go down it can get quite expensive). Despite the very difficult combat and the jumping up to ledge issue, I did enjoy the gameBtw, the 60 hours was just for 1 play through			",146,6,0,34,6,0,43

												Bugged as hell, I've lost count of how many times I got stuck on some rock or cliff in the scenery. Best advice I can give is SAVE A LOT. Also, jumping is a nightmare in this game.But damn, it's addicting! The combat system is very challenging and actually requires some skill, it's not just ""click till it dies"". The leveling system is pretty original too. You only raise your skills if you find some trainer after leveling up. Having played as a bandit, I'm not sure how well magic works in the game. The in-game world isn't so terribly big (compared to beasts like Skyrim), but it's still a vast open world with a decent number of side-quests to keep you busy. It aged very well for a 5-year-old RPG. Way better than the polished up sequel too.			",837,405,21,117,74,13,124

												Playing Risen is kind of like ""Elder Scrolls light"" I Really liked this title. Risen is unforgiving, there's very little hand holding so you'll actually have to play the game. To me that was the hook. I played for over 20 hours before I got any kind of armor. Money comes slow at first, speeds up as you go, but everything costs money. Combat is pretty damn good. You swing your weapon and get the feeling that it's heavy. If you block you may get knocked backwards if you parry you may get your wepon knocked aside leaving you vulnerable. The good news is with training you can  also perform these skills. Eventually you'll be pretty strong and able to handle just about anything, but enemies are dangerous always. It's entirely possible to be killed by the same enemy that killed you when you first started a new game.Save a lot, Risen isn't full of checkpoints every time you take a step. There are autosaves, but they're few and far between. Leveling up isn't particularly difficult, but you can't place skill points without going to a trainer and paying for them. I liked that too, you've even got to work a little to raise a skill. And choose wisely because even tho the crafting options can help you make up diferences, it's difficult to master skills while keeping a good balance. Crafting is cool, but pretty flawed. You can make weapons, but only swords, no axes, staves, hammers, or bows of any kind; these have to be found or purchased. You can make rings and amulets, but until you have all materials together you dont get to see what you can make. There are no crafting ""plans"" you just get options when you use a crating station, I.E. Forge, or goldsmith table. There are alchemy recipies and cooking recipies however.Travel is pretty basic, but be prepared to walk everywhere you want to go because there are no fast travel options. Later in the game you can get teleport stones to bring you closer to destinations, but until then you're hoofing it. I personally liked that, i like to explore in games like this. Questing can feel fairly slow, but you get experience quickly and the rewards are usually worth it. Not to mention that the game is pretty linnear so you've got to do them anyway : )As far as world environments go I liked the idea of a fantasy RPG being played on a tropical island. It was a pretty refreshing change from the typical forest and castle environment most of us are use to. Graphics are dated but in my opinion have held up really well. There's still volumetric lighting and shadows, the textures are great, and design itself looks good. If the polygon count were higher it would be on par with anything newer. Sounds are good, music is good, voice acting isn't amazing but it could be a lot worse. The dialogue seemed sort of jumbled from time to time, seemingly due to the dialogue choices the game gives you. Conversaions just seemed to occasionally be off subject. Play value? Yep! I got almost 60 hours out of my single playthrough... Awseome. This is a big, big deal to me and one fact I love a whole lot. In a time when a ""slow burn"" is considered something like 10 hours it's excellent to get my money's worth out of a good title.The biggest complaint I have is the very underwhelming boss fight at the end. And I mean really damn underwhelming. This however should not dissuade you from playing the game because pretty much everything else is solid and pretty fun.Buy it, play it, wonder why you waited so long. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you liked the Gothic series, you will like this game as well. Its literally the same concept. There are a ton of good stuff to say about this game, I liked that they werent affraid to use vulgar words, it always knocks me off a bit when people talk sophisticated in sewers and places full of rats and dirt and everything. The battle system is like the afore mentioned series, you never feel like you are a god, there are plenty of creatures that will kick your rear end for a long while until you get better skills, equipment. I quite liked the fact that every monster has a weakness, a pattern of how they fight which you can exploit if you pay attention, however in some cases it's still hard to figure out what's your opponent going to do. The only thing I didn't like was the lack of models for NPCs, it's kind of disappointing when you see the same faces in every town. Story is kind of meh, its not bad, but its nothing extraordinary either, average at best. Overall I'd highly recommend this game, great spells, great system, lots of choices to go with, classic Gothic/Piranha Bytes game. 9/10			",78,5,11,28,3,0,3

												This actually isn't a recommendation.In fact it's a suggestion to stay the hell away from the game. It's DRM attempts to install drivers into your system.  If anyone values their system they wouldn't intentionally do this.I'm glad I only wasted the $5 on it during the steam sale rather than actually paying full price.  I'd suggest if you did get it, consider cracking it to bypass the stupid DRM.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A challenging Skyrim lite adventure, with combat system requiring more competence than in Witcher 3 and voice acting bordering on uncanny enough to enjoy the experience rather than going through motions.Upon crashing on island you find yourself fixing everyone's problems, from orcs being too overly rowdy with bashing the skulls in on the roads, to decade long daddy issues of newly met characters. From rags to riches, you start hitting overfed mosquitos with a stick, advance yourself through ranks as a trustee of 2 different factions( one in two denominations ) to find yourself hitting more fantasy lore revered monsters with a stick that has a pointy metal edge on top. You get to traverse the maze of unmarked investigations, one thing already dead within the real of video game convenience as well speech checks, that if taken too far can land you with floor sweeping job, or without your head. Ah the possibilities.The cons :The game however, can be a bit too formulaic in gatekeeping certain content, directly tied in your equipment upgrades through main mission. The crafting is pretty basic and the advantages of advancing certain skill paths pretty unclear, especially that you will find yourself short on training points and gold most of game. Even if alot of quests leave you to your own devices in figuring out the solution, often they aren't as intuitive as they could. Resorting to a guide, if not often, isn't anything unusual when it comes to Risen. I mean, there are a lot of games to play.Overall if you know and enjoy games like Gothic 1 and 2, this game will click with you. If you like map markers and a combat where your character sommersaults from opponent to opponent with minimal effort on your side, it won't be a worthy purchase. If you like Witcher games, this might be a 50/50 roll.			",138,16,5,19,9,3,12

												To anyone who has played the first 2 Gothic games and liked them: This is the closest we will get to a successor for that specific type of game we crave.To anyone else: This is a action-RPG with a few differences that IMO make it worth the price to play it:1. Both Enemies and resources/consumables are finite meaning that there is no ''absurd grinding just to take one big baddie'', but at the same time the difficulty of the quests and monster placements have a nice curve to them so that you will most likely clear them in roughly the same order anyway. It's just that knowing that there's a natural end in sight aka: ''there's nothing left to kill'' makes the experience feel like your presence matters more in the world.2. While the first point isn't all that unique having that in a Open-World does give it more of a niche that other bigger titles like the TES's don't have.3. Item placements ( such as in chests or just laying around ) are static so after finishing it once ( or looking it up ) you can get a rough idea of where this and that weapon/consumables are, but while other may see this as ''lacking in replay value'' I see it as ''Nice gonna try to beat that tougher opponent to get a head-start next time'' since this again plays with the good difficulty they have. Also a lot of the good weapons have a pretty high stat requirement so you can't just go straight to one of the top weapons in game and use it immediately.And now some cons:1. The story tries to follow from the ending of Gothic 3 ( the neutral ending btw ) but at the same time try to be a new ''Original IP'' since they didn't have the license anymore after the 3rd game which might make fans of the Gothic games feel a uncanny valley effect throughout this game.2. The story itself is also IMO kinda lackluster, which is a shame but then again the preceding games mentioned above while having IMO a few better characters were sorta the same in overall quality so if you're searching for deep and engaging characters/story then you might want to look elsewhere. ( Although while not deep this and it's predecessors do have probably the most down-to-earth or normalish feeling cast ever IMHO)			",178,53,2,32,16,8,24

												My first ever A-RPG was Fable: The Lost Chapters. It is one of my favorite games to this day. This game is better than that. I'll do good/bad lists as I prefer to read them myself as well because they are easier to read:Good:+ Voiced protagonist unlike many other RPGs+ Lots of dialogue options+ Quality voice acting+ Choices matter increasing replayability+ Idyllic setting, relaxing soundtrack+ Atmospheric environments, good lighting effects unless you tinker with brightness settings+ Burried treasures+ Challenging combat, limited and expensive gear+ Tomb raiding, dungeon puzzles, traps+ Immersive character building. Your hero doesn't learn stuff out of nowhere after levelling up, i.e. distributing skill points. Instead you gain LP (learning points) which you can spend at trainers (NPCs who teach you stuff).+ Class system doesn't restrict your play style too much. You can be a dumb bandit but still can use magic via scrolls if you want for example.+ Reminds me of other A-RPGs I enjoyed such as Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, Witcher 1, Fable: The Lost Chapters and Dark Souls.+ Fast travel system.+  I love some of the animations in the game. Particularly lizardman idles where they snap a fly in the air while standing around or look around like a paranoid or shaking their head. They are strangely cute and realistic <3 Bad:- No respec system in the game (can be done via console commands, cheating)- Sometimes you might wonder why you couldn't complete a quest. There is no handholding to the point you start wondering if the game is bugged but most of the time it is not. You probably need to talk to somebody but you haven't.- Some may find the combat too difficult at the start.- No sprinting. You can get Speed magic which is basically sprint which should have been in the game from the start instead of a spell which you can get quite later in the game.Of course recommended. 9/10. A must play.			",259,64,7,60,25,1,33

												so, i have mixed feelings about this game, when i bought it i bought as part of a bundle with risen 2 and 3 for something like £6, so £2 a game is a pretty good deal. first things first i did not expect the game to contain as much as it does, Alchmey, mining, smithing, gold smith, Magic, runes, Scrolls and a pretty big world to explore. there is litrally loads you can do with your character.Combat is where the game lacks :( which is unfortunate to be honest, depending on your wepon of choice depends on how you defeat enemies, early game you wont worry about damage as most monsters will be under your level and will fall realitivly easily but later on around lvl15 when you start getting lizardmen turning up and direwolves it gets very hard because they can smash you into pulp in 1 or 2 hits.Another thing to bear in mind is the Leveling up system, to begin with you will level up fairly quickly and when you lvl up you get 10 action points which can be used to advance a skill whether it be Sword fighting, Axe Fighting, Staff Fighting, this is very important as if you waste points in areas of your character your not going to use, then late game is going to be near impossible for you.All in all, i'm impressed how good the game is for the age of the game and the amount of things you can do, Ohh and one last thing, The Voice acting is pretty bad... But it works very well with the feel of the game.DanBsc Games Design ",214,23,2,24,19,4,47

I finished it, and now i dont know what to do with my life anymore, so im thinking very seriously to play it a again.I got really inmersed the first time in this game, that i was so scared of almost everything.As another good point at this game, i'd say many things weren't predictible and i really enjoyed that, worked to fuel up my fears.In my opinion, this is a trial and error kind of game, so get ready to rage sometimes.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Learn to save early, and often... Random spike booby trap came out of the ground with no warning for an insta-kill. Second time round I noticed the snail transformation just lying on the ground fortunately. Game is a 6/7 out of 10, not the best RPG i've played, The main charachters voice acting is poor, and annoying, The exploration of the map isn't overly rewarding as you'll late have to trek back there for a quest, so may as well save the time. And the story line is filled with monotanous fetch quests... Not sure why I like this game at all, probably for the sheer mention of magic, Titans, and Gods, which i've yet to see any of by the way...			",193,32,4,38,9,4,18

												Perfect for those that wanted a new Gothic game but didn't care if it was set in the Gothic universe or not. There are lot of similarities, which is all well and good, especially since it is from the Piranha Bytes, the developers of the first three Gothic titles.Essentially this is an open world exploration RPG in which you don't know what you're doing unless you really focus. The map is quite large without and fast travel and you don't always know where you are. You can walk into an area where you are too low a level for, it's easy to not have the correct skills for a quest and be completely boned. In a nutshell, this is a game that is out to get you like a Dungeon Master that holds grudges.PROS:+ Good graphics for the time+ Physics are fun to play with+ Easy to get your butt kicked+ Big map+ Tons of things to do+ Many skills to learn+ Great for Gothic fans+ Fun to talk your way out of situationsCONS:- Steep learning curve for people who have never played a Gothic game before- Sometimes feels more RPG than action, which does not feel right for the series- Some humans refuse to die- Perhaps too easy to die- Too easy to wander into high level areas when under leveled- You always seem to need a higher skill level than what you've learned, no matter where you go- Combat controls too clunky- Leveling up and learning skills is a chore, an EXPENSIVE CHORE			",422,26,5,57,7,2,20

												When I was a little kid, my friend borrowed me Gothic. When I started playing it, I was astonished by the beautiful graphics and that undescribable atmosphere... Risen as well as Gothic was created by Piranha Bytes. Even though how ancient are these games, you stick to the story so much you have to play it until the bare end. Sure some can't stand the graphics. But if you're used to these oldies, you'll love risen.			",379,101,7,93,40,3,55

												Nice RPG in the 3rd person. Rewards exploration, so do not be in a rush, look around your surroundings before moving on to the next area, it will help. Kinda old school, so if you are looking for the latest and greatest, you might not enjoy, but if you like the classics and taking your time planning your character, this might just be for you. the price sure won't break the bank either ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I get steam to check the files and it keeps saying 1 needs to be replaced each time i run it. I even did a complete new installation and it still does the same thing....When i press the windows key during the black screen and try to reopen the window i get a debug error message saying i have a memory dump issue....now i have no problems with any other game at all nor does my computer have any issues either.

												INTRORisen is one of those games that will♥♥♥♥♥♥you off many times, i have rage quit many times due to being killed by lizardmen and tons of other creatures. If you think you're going to be a baddass from the first 5-10 hours you are wrong, you start off as a worthless piece of s**t with no armor and no good weapons. At the begginning you are given a choice to follow the Order (The ""Law"" enforcers) or the Dons men (Thieves, rogues and some warriors). A mage would gladly follow the order and a thieve, archer or sword fighter would follow the dons men.MAGICIn about 10-15 hours into the game (If you followed the Order) you will obtain magical abilities. Now, don't get too excited, (TES fans, i am one myself) magic in risen is not over the top or Really Awesome! like in TES (The Elder Scrolls), you have your three crystals, Fireball, Ice, and Magic bullet/missile, these are self explanatory but magic bullet is basically a machingun spell :).You also can create scrolls with the ingredients and a quil and of course empty scroll paper and the rune. Anyone can use Scrolls but you need training to make them and use crystal magic.Combat - MeleeMelee weapon vary, you have your basics like; Sword, Two Handed, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sword and axes, and many more like; Machete, Demon Blade, Titan Wing and many more. You can block with a shield or you two handed weapon like a staff or sowrd. Axes are slow but more powerful. You can dodge by double tapping W, A, S or D, and you dodge in that direction. People say combat is boring i think it is great. You can upgrade you Staff, axe, sword and your ranged weapons of course and gain new abilities like; Interupt an attack and more combos and more.Combat - RangedYou got your bows and crossbows (Most should be self explanatory). Bows use arrows and Crossbows use Bolts. What else to say?AlchemyI cannot stress enough about how much i LOVE alchemy in this game, its not the best but its great for what it is. You can buy recipes or find them, they tell you the ingredients you need for potions and food (Thats for the cooking segment), you also need Vials for the potions and sometimes water. You need to go into nature and collect plants and herbs to use for the potions for example a Health potion needs 3 healing herbs and some other stuff. You also need to have the alchemy skill to perform ANY of this.CookingCooking important, fried meat could be the difference between life and death. You will need a frying pan and raw meat to use a fire, you can also use a cauldron to make soups and stews, you may find apples, onions, meat, carrots and many other ingredients threw out your experience, these may be used to create meals to eat. Some food restores healt and others restores mana but the best restore both.The WorldYou will die MANY times if you are not prepared or just a plain dumbass, be prepared, always have 10+ health potions & mana potions for your safety, remember to block and use all skill applicable in combat. HAVE FUNFinal VerdictRisen is not the best RPG but it certainly is something new in an old genre. If you enjoy hard but rewarding games than risen is for you, if you liked gothic Risen is for you.

												I started PC gaming with no money in my pocket for games and old franken-pc. Luckily for my though I have an awesome brother that shared his game library with me so I would have games. Looking through his huge library I wanted to play a RPG, but lacking the graphics and processing power to play Skyrim I chose Risen over many better rated and more popular games. I went into Risen with a open mind and a mindset locked on the idea of going on an adventure as I go through a whole new world filled with foriegn beasties and skilled warriors. This game delivered many great hours of entertainment through an intresting and well designed world to explore, and intriguing plot characters. I felt immersed in this world with all it's beautiful landscape and lore, and I found myself playing it over and over wantig to get further. I haven't played Risen in a few months, but I am looking forward to picking it back up one day and continuing my escapade on this island of wonder and amazement. I highly recommend picking it up if you haven't played many RPGs and want to get into them. This game got my ball rolling to want to play more RPGs and I'm glad I was able to play it. Just as a post script I did buy the game even though I could play it for free from my brother's account because it had given me solid hours of play and was worth supporting the developers.

												From the moment my character washed up on the beach(es) theres several beaches in this game. Thats the cool thing(and Beautiful) about it that there's many Visuals packed into the game: The days act differntly every time you play(of course it rains and I think the sound is one interesting use of details. Even you fans of those rpg are in to detail oriented(realism) will know what I mean. Also theres some sex,drugs,rock( a hooker playing a flute, and the drugs part is selling weed to someone). If you get stalked by very large Packs of animals""Im not talking just a few here. Im saying the entire island"" (IF♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥enough)will stalk youre sore ♥♥♥♥♥loser for washing up on the wrong isle. Also the weapons take some time to acquire: Lots of Double edged, bows, some magical runes and things. Those take time to learn. Which makes it a longer game than most of this genre. But it is worth it because the creatures need to be given a 'Decent Funeral' when necessary firepower to back you up...			",146,16,2,17,13,0,19

												An unusual game, that feels a little dated today (5 years down the line). It is by no means a spectacular game, but it has a gripping charm, and urges you forward every step of the way. Its combat is off putting at times and the voice acting is pretty rough but the small things make up for its faults. It give you the choice to do almost exactly as you please and doen't hold back with the number of things to do. The HUD is minimal and it all feels organic in the way you're given and can access information and it's a nice change. This review feels a little like the game it self, confusing. You don't know if it's brilliant or rubbish.			",318,48,8,56,27,5,66

Second time round I noticed the snail transformation just lying on the ground fortunately. Game is a 6/7 out of 10, not the best RPG i've played, The main charachters voice acting is poor, and annoying, The exploration of the map isn't overly rewarding as you'll late have to trek back there for a quest, so may as well save the time. And the story line is filled with monotanous fetch quests... Not sure why I like this game at all, probably for the sheer mention of magic, Titans, and Gods, which i've yet to see any of by the way...			",193,32,4,38,9,4,18

												Playing Risen is kind of like ""Elder Scrolls light"" I Really liked this title. Risen is unforgiving, there's very little hand holding so you'll actually have to play the game. To me that was the hook. I played for over 20 hours before I got any kind of armor. Money comes slow at first, speeds up as you go, but everything costs money. Combat is pretty damn good. You swing your weapon and get the feeling that it's heavy. If you block you may get knocked backwards if you parry you may get your wepon knocked aside leaving you vulnerable. The good news is with training you can  also perform these skills. Eventually you'll be pretty strong and able to handle just about anything, but enemies are dangerous always. It's entirely possible to be killed by the same enemy that killed you when you first started a new game.Save a lot, Risen isn't full of checkpoints every time you take a step. There are autosaves, but they're few and far between. Leveling up isn't particularly difficult, but you can't place skill points without going to a trainer and paying for them. I liked that too, you've even got to work a little to raise a skill. And choose wisely because even tho the crafting options can help you make up diferences, it's difficult to master skills while keeping a good balance. Crafting is cool, but pretty flawed. You can make weapons, but only swords, no axes, staves, hammers, or bows of any kind; these have to be found or purchased. You can make rings and amulets, but until you have all materials together you dont get to see what you can make. There are no crafting ""plans"" you just get options when you use a crating station, I.E. Forge, or goldsmith table. There are alchemy recipies and cooking recipies however.Travel is pretty basic, but be prepared to walk everywhere you want to go because there are no fast travel options. Later in the game you can get teleport stones to bring you closer to destinations, but until then you're hoofing it. I personally liked that, i like to explore in games like this. Questing can feel fairly slow, but you get experience quickly and the rewards are usually worth it. Not to mention that the game is pretty linnear so you've got to do them anyway : )As far as world environments go I liked the idea of a fantasy RPG being played on a tropical island. It was a pretty refreshing change from the typical forest and castle environment most of us are use to. Graphics are dated but in my opinion have held up really well. There's still volumetric lighting and shadows, the textures are great, and design itself looks good. If the polygon count were higher it would be on par with anything newer. Sounds are good, music is good, voice acting isn't amazing but it could be a lot worse. The dialogue seemed sort of jumbled from time to time, seemingly due to the dialogue choices the game gives you. Conversaions just seemed to occasionally be off subject. Play value? Yep! I got almost 60 hours out of my single playthrough... Awseome. This is a big, big deal to me and one fact I love a whole lot. In a time when a ""slow burn"" is considered something like 10 hours it's excellent to get my money's worth out of a good title.The biggest complaint I have is the very underwhelming boss fight at the end. And I mean really damn underwhelming. This however should not dissuade you from playing the game because pretty much everything else is solid and pretty fun.Buy it, play it, wonder why you waited so long. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have spent a decent amount of time in Risen but have not yet finished the main story. However I will give an overview of what like and dislike so far.Pros:- Interesting story- Differing factions - Interesting side questsSo so:- Combat can seem quite clunky and awkward when facing multiple enemies - Fairly steep learning curve Cons:- Deceptively small world - Not much to do outside of the quests I do recommend this game but ideally would pick it up on a sale as £8 feels a bit steep			",134,41,0,19,14,4,26

												If you played Gothic series you will find a lot familiar stuff (not strange though cause it has same developer) and gameplay looks like in Gothic 3. The story is pretty good but NPC faces are really bad (like 3-5 models fro both male/female. I mean Gothic 1-2 has the same amount but... Gothic is 2001-2002 game and Risen was released in 2009...All in all I give this game 6/10 and recommend to give it a try even price is not so high (8$) but better to wait until some sale to get it for 3$ or something. Can't wait to give Risen 2 and Risen 3 a try.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Huge open world and plenty of stuff to do. I like how it's R rated. Random NPCs will literally tell you to f**k off, you can get laid at brothels, you can learn to become a range of things from a pickpocketing mage to a warrior badass .Not quite as big as Elder Scrolls 3, 4,5  but is still really condensed and you can still get lost roaming through the forests and disovering cities and caves 'n stuff.

												What I hate most in RPGs is that story in games of this genre are usually generic. And this game is not an exception - again you are the hero and must save the world. BORING! Then, as regards RPG genre, comes the world of the game. And here this game is quite good. Decent amount of NPCs and every one is doing something. During the day he can be a trader, in the evening he goes to the tavern or play a flute sitting near campfire etc., etc. This part of games Piranha Bytes always does well. Then comes the combat. And here the most controversal point of this game is burrowed. Theoretically the combat system is good. Attack chains, parries, blocks, dodge rolls - all is here. And at first glance the combat is skill based. But only at first glance, because implementation of the combat system is very poor. Parries are useless because activation time is same as for attacks, thus to land it properly you must just randomly press right mouse button. Dodges are also not great at all, because after performing one you will stay in place without ability to move yourself or even move camera for approximately 1 second. But this is not the worst moment of dodge rolls. The worst thing about it is that camera is locked on your opponent, so you can't dodge just left or right, you will always dodge around your opponent. And if you fight against few opponents at once, you will dodge right into the monsters that stay from the left or right hand from one, that you fight at this particular moment. So combat here is really ""pain in one place"", but it could be really good with proper implementation. OK, let's move further. Voice acting and sound effects are decent. Visuals are not bad, but all places of the game world look almost the same. With more divercity in flora types it will be much better. So, lets conclude - this game is not the best one in the genre, but not the worst one either. And if you want some adventures, then forward - the world of Risen awaits for its savior, and don't forget about princess!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's not often you get a MC with a witty/sarcastic tongue but Risen has provided. The Voice acting can be a bit dodgy at times but i reckon that the writing more than makes up for that.Gameplay is standard fare if you've played any of the Gothic games, but there's lots of things to do and lots of well written characters and quests... if not particularly well acted ones (some are good, most are alright and a few are bad, i don't think any are dire tho).I'd recommend it.

												A good spiritual successor to the Gothic games, which I don't play nearly as often as I'd like. Combat is excellent, and like Gothic, your actual skill at it means more than anything they give you to improve it in the game. You also get 3 combat paths in the main story, so you can play through its rather quick campaign multiple times without getting bored. The only downsides to this game are the sparse character models, and that it's a little short, with no DLC. An underrated gem. ",88,34,0,36,40,0,27

												Just played through this game in a couple days... It's addictive... The game starts out, ok, very nice graphics, nice dialogue, nice animations very polished game. The voice acting was very good IMO, especially the smith oscar in the bandit camp... Loved the interaction he offered. I didn't care for the story, it felt cheesy and kind of stupid, the main character was likable and simple. The world itself is very frustrating because simply there is way too much♥♥♥♥♥♥ What I mean is there is a very large amount of confusing forrest and little nooks/crannies. They jammed a lot of stuff in a small island. It's hard to navigate through parts of the world and until you get a map from Nelson the cartographer, you are completely oblivious to where you are. You can find multiple teleport stones which there are 14.... That's outrageous... Wayyyyy too many teleport stones. It makes the play impatient and rushed. Overall, I enjoyed the game but I felt myself very annoyed with how simple the main story was. It was very much, go get these items and come back to me. Oh ok you got them all??? Now we need you to go get these items and come back. That's literally all the game is. The crystal disc gathering, the titan armour gathering and then the boss fight. All the inbetween stuff is great but the main quest was lacking creative depth... go fetch quest are boring and feel like chores rather than gaming experiences... Overall I'd say 7.5/10 I wouldn't replay the game and honestly, at the end of my bandit camp playthrough, I just used console cheats to experience magic because I didn't want to play through again all of the go fetch quests. The magic is good in the game I would rather have done magic, the bandit character isn't developed at all and the crossbow is AWFUL. Even headshots do almost no damage to strong enemies, the titan crossbow does less than 1/10th health damage to a lizard elite.			",7,0,0,6,1,0,2

												Let me begin by saying that this game will not start you off with any experience or skills. You need to be aware of that before you ever start playing. You start out shipwrecked on an island wearing only the ragged clothes on your back . This game comes about as close to a real life scenario as you can get.If you got shipwrecked in real life with little to no combat experience or training it would be just like Risen. You have to find weapons, potions, food, and all the other stuff by exploring, learning to fight and getting experience killing various beasts and monsters.I love the fact that as I get more skills, training, better weapons and experience, that the game gets better. I was getting frustrated with getting killed all the time, but I slowed down and took my time to build up my skills. Pigs and wolves used to eat me for dinner all the time. Now I can pretty much just smack them down and get on with my travels.The game is really hard for the first ten hours or so, but it gets a lot better and easier if you stick with it. I have seen a lot of reviews talking about the horrible combat, but most people judged it on the early game play. You have to train and level up to get more attacks and better combat. If you stick it out and train enough, you will get some very effective and proper attack and parry sequences to use. You also have to have enough strength or agilty to make the combat more effective and deadly. Like in real life, you don't just know how to sword fight and use weapons. You have to train and practice non-stop to get the skills and experience. There is a reason people have to practice martial arts for years before the can call them selves a master or to even be above the novice levels of skill.When I first tried Risen right after it was released I hated it. I finally came back and tried it again and now I love it. It's not a perfect game, but it is a solid 8 out of 10 for me. There are some flaws, and some things annoy me, but so does real life. The length of time the game gives you: and the feeling of growing and getting better and progressing make it all the more enjoyable.One of the only things I did not like was the lack of armor and clothes. You get a pretty fair amount of weapons, but the armor is pretty limited.  I can overlook that in light of the fact that in real life you would not have an endless array of new outfits to find. You get a lot of chances to get better weapons, both from enemy drops and vendors. Weapons are pretty satisfying, they fit with the game progression and leveling up.After finally finishing my first play through, I can see why this game has such a dedicated following. It's called a ""cult"" game on some forums, and I would have to agree. It's got a pretty good length, but not one where you get so bored with all the meaningless fedex fetch quests where you never finish it. I loved the Gothic games back in the day, and now Risen is on my list of extremely satisfying games. I am now going to do another play doing the whole bandit quest line. The game is that good that I want to fully experience every twist and turn from all the different progression/character lines. The fact that you have multiple ways to approach all the quests, and very diverging paths and consequences make it something rare to find in today's modern RPGs.  The graphics are still pretty good, even though this game is five years old. The game world is amazing, lots of gorgeous scenic views and natural locations. Ruins and cities are very nicely done, if a bit repetitive.If you have patience and love to play a game where you learn and grow as you progress through it then I highly recommend it for true RPG fans.

												While I would like to play this game and experience it to its fullest, I just can't. The combat system in this game is utterly atrocious and it makes progressing through the game extremely painful and time consuming, even on ""easy"". Most enemies can kill your character in just a few hits, while it takes you dozens of hits to kill them, it's just a very flawed design. So while I would like to finish a game I bought, I simply feel it isn't worth it due to all its flaws.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When you get right down to it, this is the game that Morrowind wanted to be--an island adventure in which every corner of the map is packed with content, rewarding players who take the time to explore. The combat system's a bit counterintuitive at first, but it's ultimately quite fun once you figure it out (and it's nice to play an RPG where you can actually beat monsters much higher-level than you if you can figure out a proper strategy.) My only complaint is that there's only one playable avatar available--the option to play as a woman would have gone a long way towards compensating for the male-dominated cast.(Protip: join the mages. Ice magic is awesome.)			",91,51,0,16,1,0,3

												If you are looking for a great RPG in a more classic way, with no ""flashy kill cam moves"", as seen in todays' most games, look no further. The world is breathing, colorful and with great variety. And so is the quest system. Few of them follow the standard gather and kill pattern. Most are connected with each other and do a good part in taking you along your adventure, exploring the whole island of Risen. With no doubt the best part of Risen is the epic sound track. It's on par with background tunes from the elder scrolls, perhaps even surpassing it, as it drags you in, the moment you are starting your adventure. Voice acting (german) is top notch, with great dialogues which will be good for a laugh more than once. Promised ;) Playtime is around 15h-30h (normal) depending on your playstyle. Don't get turnoff by your first footsteps in the begnning. This is yet one of these few games which don't take your hand. It's not easy, but go on. You won't regret it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I enjoyed this game all the way through. From the developers of the Gothic series... which you can tell because it's pretty much like those games but modernized. The combat is improved, and the graphics are very much improved. For 2009 this game looks amazing (with the graphics turned all the way up). The game isn't perfect... there are some glitches, but they're mostly minor and don't affect gameplay much. A big chunk of this game is about exploring. Most of the game you're exploring a huge island, and later parts of the game you'll be in ruins and underground caves. Most of the enemies you kill stay dead, but at the beginning of a chapter some enemies do respawn. The combat is challenging, but satisfying. The story starts alittle dull, but by the end it's very interesting. If you're up for a challenging Action-RPG, and your computer can handle it, then I highly recommend Risen.

I even did a complete new installation and it still does the same thing....When i press the windows key during the black screen and try to reopen the window i get a debug error message saying i have a memory dump issue....now i have no problems with any other game at all nor does my computer have any issues either. I just want to play the game as it looks sweet as!			",546,143,30,93,47,10,62

												An unusual game, that feels a little dated today (5 years down the line). It is by no means a spectacular game, but it has a gripping charm, and urges you forward every step of the way. Its combat is off putting at times and the voice acting is pretty rough but the small things make up for its faults. It give you the choice to do almost exactly as you please and doen't hold back with the number of things to do. The HUD is minimal and it all feels organic in the way you're given and can access information and it's a nice change. This review feels a little like the game it self, confusing. You don't know if it's brilliant or rubbish.			",318,48,8,56,27,5,66

												This is one of the more challenging games I've been subjected to.  Not your typical Hack 'N Slash, you have to get to know your enemies, learn when to block and when to strike.  You can easily be overwhelmed with too many combatants at once so you're forced to find creative ways of thinning the packs.  My first few hours were frustrating, I wasn't used to taking on an actual role of having to defend rather than guzzle potions, in the end I plowed through over 50 hours of gameplay to complete the game and explore all it had to offer.  It's a beautiful world and there's plenty to explore.  I would definately recommend this to any friends that enjoy using their wits rather than just blindly clicking their mouse.

												This is a lot better than some people have suggested. It felt much more cramped than Gothic 3, which was pretty good with the community patch, but there was a decent amount of freedom. I would have appreciated better maps and perhaps some relief from the punishing difficulty in early levels. I liked the challenge of rising from the muck in earlier Gothic games, but once you've done a few of them, it gets pretty tiresome starting from the bottom again! Also, as many have pointed out, the final boss fight was abominable. Finally, I should mention that I originally bought this game from Amazon and simply could not get it to work, even with direct help from Deep Silver. I bought it on Steam just because I had never had a problem with Steam. Sure enough, it fired up without a hitch. At any rate, Risen is worth getting on sale.			",234,32,1,31,6,1,30

												A great RPG with a great and atmospheric start: The first half of the game is the best, but the end of the main quest is also alright. You start out washed ashore on an island, knowing nothing. You fight your way through the wilderness to civilisation where you will eventually be given a choice: Join the native bandits or join the foreign orderliness of the Inquisition. Great game for everyone who likes story RPGs.			",46,10,0,20,10,0,16

On the way you are able to join one of the factions and save Faranga from total destruction.Be a hunter for the Don, Warrior of the Order or become one of the mages in your quest to save the island.The atmosphere is great and music gives you the feeling of belonging in that world.

												Being first and foremost an RPG fan myself, I can't possibly praise this game enough. This is widely considered among the most loyal of Pirahna Bytes (Pirahna Bytes is the name of the development team) fans to be the 'unofficial Gothic 4.' This game easily inspires the imagination creating a wonderous and fantastic RPG experience. It may not be continuation of the Gothic storyline, but to any Gothic fan, the general feeling of euphoria born from this gaming exerperience is almost indistinguishible from that which was felt in Gothics 1, 2 and 3. Don't let the 77/100 rating be misleading. I would easily give this game a 90/100. As this is merely a matter of opinion, though, I would recommend trying the demo first. Just note that the demo can't begin to capture the depth and variety of the full game.			",164,23,2,24,13,2,32

												This game is quite the hidden gem of modern RPGs. The only way to describe it is if Morrowind, Two Worlds, and Lost had a Devil's threesome, and Morrowind got pregnant, this would be the miracle spawn.The graphics and gameplay are almost on par with Skyrim (and while I'd still consider Skyrim the better of the two, this is a close second). The story isn't nearly as strong as what you'd expect from an Elder Scrolls game... probably because it's not (which the good combat mechanics will immediately give away)... but it's certainly not bad, and the voice-acting, the dialog script, and pretty much all of the character interaction in this game will keep your immersed.Playing this game is like rediscovering Morrowind. Not in the sense of it being Morrowind, because it's not, but in the sense of figuring out the unique game mechanics as you play and being surprised and elated with every new bit you come across.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

												I was initially put off by the pile of negative reviews this game had received & after playing it I can certainly understand most of them. Now I'm writing a recommendation here so I don't hate it, in fact I like it enough that I'm getting Risen 2. There is a good game here hidden under many many flaws. The first three will hit you right away, considering that this is the ""superior PC version"" as opposed to the awful console version one would expect key bindings, there is no character creator resulting in everyone playing as Mr generic & the combat is awful until you get used to it at witch point it becomes boring with every enemy being a pattern boss. The map is also pretty useless & annoying since you can only view some maps via the inventory at witch point you can't move properly. Magic & archery suck with mages needing a consent supply of mana potions & archery feeling floaty & weak like firing feathers from a piece of string & many of the skills such as blacksmithing are a complete waste of time. So what did I like? Honestly I can't say, but I enjoyed it enough to get through it. Not the strongest of recommendations but if you love RPGs & see it on sale give it a try.			",201,42,0,65,15,3,17

												The this I like best about this game is the calm and relaxed atmosphere. This makes it a real enjoyment to play. I have played through it around 3-5 times, and I still feel that I could play more without getting bored. The combat system might be a bit difficult to master. In order to be real good you'll need precise timing of your attacks. The weapon classes are very different. I must say that it's much harder to go with staff fighting than using an axe.I can't remember encountering any gamebreaking bugs. Only one I can think of, but I would look at it as more of a glitch than a bug.			",238,66,10,38,54,0,72

												If you've played and liked games from the GOTHIC series, you will definitely like this game.An epic role-playing game with a nice story and plenty of colourful characters - except for the main protagonist, who' s a bit bland (probably to make it easier for the players to add their own interpretations). Apart from the epic main quest, there are also interesting side-quests.The game makes you choose between two factions, but in light of the main story, these choices are mostly fluff, though they do somewhat change the weapons and skills you will find yourself using.As in all good rpgs, there is a crafting system including cooking, smithing, alchemy, and inscription - and gathering components will keep you busy as well, without being tedious.All in all, a nice round, and entertaining RPG package.

												I started PC gaming with no money in my pocket for games and old franken-pc. Luckily for my though I have an awesome brother that shared his game library with me so I would have games. Looking through his huge library I wanted to play a RPG, but lacking the graphics and processing power to play Skyrim I chose Risen over many better rated and more popular games. I went into Risen with a open mind and a mindset locked on the idea of going on an adventure as I go through a whole new world filled with foriegn beasties and skilled warriors. This game delivered many great hours of entertainment through an intresting and well designed world to explore, and intriguing plot characters. I felt immersed in this world with all it's beautiful landscape and lore, and I found myself playing it over and over wantig to get further. I haven't played Risen in a few months, but I am looking forward to picking it back up one day and continuing my escapade on this island of wonder and amazement. I highly recommend picking it up if you haven't played many RPGs and want to get into them. This game got my ball rolling to want to play more RPGs and I'm glad I was able to play it. Just as a post script I did buy the game even though I could play it for free from my brother's account because it had given me solid hours of play and was worth supporting the developers.

												Risen is a very intersting game. It feels strange at first and combatis very cumbersome, however if you stick with it for a littel while it realy grows on you and you realise how deep the game actually goes. This is a game where plowing through the first hour or so is essential to really appreciate the rest the game has to offer. The graphics are nothing to shout about and the games doesn't have any stand-out original features. But fans of the Gothic series will feel right at home with this brilliantly complex and rewarding RPG. Give it a chance, at first it seems horrible and heavy, but after the first hour or so it really shines as a deep and fun experience.Pros:- Lush, densely packed environments to explore- Tactical combat with strategy- Very addictive gameplayCons:- Controls feel heavy- No controller support- Takes a while to really get into anything interesting ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It a good RPG game, its rather interesting, but you have to play for quite a bit to get into the story. At first this RPG seems quite dull, but as it evolves it reminds me of Gothic quite alot and that's a game I enjoy.I give this game 7.5/10.0As one general positive point, it is an interesting RPG with good quest designs and combat mechanizm, and as a general weakness of this game is that the character is not customizable (as in charasteristics), combat is challenging (which can be a problem for beginners and people who refer to take it easy, but others, like me, find it somehow enjoying and frustrating at the same time), and finally after playing a game like Skyrim or Fallout 3/ New Vegas, I got used to the fast travelling after you visit a place, this game offerss teleporting stones in/after chapter two but they can only take you to specific places (this is a bit weird and means quite a bit of walking is involved).In conclusion, its worth a shot for the story and another unique adventure to experience.

So far I have only played it for an hour but it still is as good as ever.  Now the graphics are way better.  It is the type of game you would play if you like Oblivion.  Also the story is great.  There is so much to it.  There is a mystery that needs to be solved.  Where do the treasures come from?  Where did all the antagonists come from?  It feels like a living breathing world you have just stumbled upon.  Recommended.			",116,11,3,6,7,0,3

												I love this game, it's got so many aspects of a great rpg packed into it. This is the game Arcania should have been and, in my opinion, is the real Gothic 4.   The island's relatively small compared to some games but it has enough going on to make it feel large enough and changes with different chapters. There are plenty of things to collect like plants and meat from dead animals ( use the frying pan to cook hitpoint restoring food or get a recipe for stew and use a cooking cauldron). You can craft spells, potions and weapons, prospect to find ore if you have the talent and a pickaxe, smithing skills as well as the usual lockpicking and pickpocketing. Carry a shovel and you can dig up hidden loot if you can spot the right locations ( the slightly cracked patches of different coloured ground). Loot isn't of the uber-powered magic variety and you're first chests won't contain the 'Balzing Fire Axe of +2 Flaming Fiery Death'. There are a good variety of enemies from the wolf and boar wildlife to skeletons, gnomes, ghouls and in the later chapters lizardmen. Hidden doors are always a favourite of mine on dungeon crawls and you find these using metal rings on the walls or hidden switches on some pictures (these don't show item tags until you find the ones which work so need some exploring). It's got a sense of humour, some more mature themes and language, and all adds up to create a good rpg. Being taken apart by Stingrats and Sea Vultures at the start can make it feel more difficult than it is until you get used to the combat and it's worth choosing either the Outlaw's fighter path or the mage's path with The Order of the Flame and getting your skills up before exploring the island. These paths aren't exclusive and whichever one you take you can combine the skills to suit your style when you find the different trainers (these use your learning points which you get from leveling up etc and either give you new skills or improve strength, dexterity or talents). The parry move (tapping the blocking button) can be difficult to time correctly but you can do without it if you rely on blocking, this just makes the fights a little longer. I find patience is the key with combat and going in swinging constantly just gets you killed.   After a while, as more things open up for your character, you'll realise what a great game this is.

												Pretty fun action RPG.  Very open feeling.  The fight mechanics are fun!  You start off super  weak, which makes it very satisfying when you become tough and dominate the beasts and bandits that crushed you at the beginning.  Also very nice to be able to deal with the three different factions and eventually choose one.  Dozens of quests and a huge stage give you interesting stuff to be doing all the time.  Then you get to about the end of Chapter 3, the broad storyline narrows down to a point, and the rails become visible under your feet.  Getting to the end from here is a little tedious, but still fun if you're a completionist like me.  Sadly the final boss fight is crap.  Straight off a 1990 Nintendo game, and uses absolutely none of the skills you've spent 50 hours developing.Summary: worth your time and money for the fun of the first 2/3 of the game.  Once it starts to drag, it's not too bad to get to the end, but be ready for a very badly designed final boss.			",179,67,0,47,14,4,22

												If you've played and liked games from the GOTHIC series, you will definitely like this game.An epic role-playing game with a nice story and plenty of colourful characters - except for the main protagonist, who' s a bit bland (probably to make it easier for the players to add their own interpretations). Apart from the epic main quest, there are also interesting side-quests.The game makes you choose between two factions, but in light of the main story, these choices are mostly fluff, though they do somewhat change the weapons and skills you will find yourself using.As in all good rpgs, there is a crafting system including cooking, smithing, alchemy, and inscription - and gathering components will keep you busy as well, without being tedious.All in all, a nice round, and entertaining RPG package.

												A great RPG with 2 different parties a player can side with by their own choice : The Don's Bandits or the Inquisition.This game allows the user to perform many side quests along the main quests, has a large but not too large world map which one can explore and a variety of items such as plants and foods (almost anything one can think of: apples, bread, eggs and even potatoes!) one can use to create potions and cook to produce foods. The graphics may be of a slightly lower quality than most games we have now, but it's nothing shocking or unusual since it is one of the older games (although it is still quite good).I definitely recommend this game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just played through this game in a couple days... It's addictive... The game starts out, ok, very nice graphics, nice dialogue, nice animations very polished game. The voice acting was very good IMO, especially the smith oscar in the bandit camp... Loved the interaction he offered. I didn't care for the story, it felt cheesy and kind of stupid, the main character was likable and simple. The world itself is very frustrating because simply there is way too much♥♥♥♥♥♥ What I mean is there is a very large amount of confusing forrest and little nooks/crannies. They jammed a lot of stuff in a small island. It's hard to navigate through parts of the world and until you get a map from Nelson the cartographer, you are completely oblivious to where you are. You can find multiple teleport stones which there are 14.... That's outrageous... Wayyyyy too many teleport stones. It makes the play impatient and rushed. Overall, I enjoyed the game but I felt myself very annoyed with how simple the main story was. It was very much, go get these items and come back to me. Oh ok you got them all??? Now we need you to go get these items and come back. That's literally all the game is. The crystal disc gathering, the titan armour gathering and then the boss fight. All the inbetween stuff is great but the main quest was lacking creative depth... go fetch quest are boring and feel like chores rather than gaming experiences... Overall I'd say 7.5/10 I wouldn't replay the game and honestly, at the end of my bandit camp playthrough, I just used console cheats to experience magic because I didn't want to play through again all of the go fetch quests. The magic is good in the game I would rather have done magic, the bandit character isn't developed at all and the crossbow is AWFUL. Even headshots do almost no damage to strong enemies, the titan crossbow does less than 1/10th health damage to a lizard elite.			",7,0,0,6,1,0,2

												A challenging Skyrim lite adventure, with combat system requiring more competence than in Witcher 3 and voice acting bordering on uncanny enough to enjoy the experience rather than going through motions.Upon crashing on island you find yourself fixing everyone's problems, from orcs being too overly rowdy with bashing the skulls in on the roads, to decade long daddy issues of newly met characters. From rags to riches, you start hitting overfed mosquitos with a stick, advance yourself through ranks as a trustee of 2 different factions( one in two denominations ) to find yourself hitting more fantasy lore revered monsters with a stick that has a pointy metal edge on top. You get to traverse the maze of unmarked investigations, one thing already dead within the real of video game convenience as well speech checks, that if taken too far can land you with floor sweeping job, or without your head. Ah the possibilities.The cons :The game however, can be a bit too formulaic in gatekeeping certain content, directly tied in your equipment upgrades through main mission. The crafting is pretty basic and the advantages of advancing certain skill paths pretty unclear, especially that you will find yourself short on training points and gold most of game. Even if alot of quests leave you to your own devices in figuring out the solution, often they aren't as intuitive as they could. Resorting to a guide, if not often, isn't anything unusual when it comes to Risen. I mean, there are a lot of games to play.Overall if you know and enjoy games like Gothic 1 and 2, this game will click with you. If you like map markers and a combat where your character sommersaults from opponent to opponent with minimal effort on your side, it won't be a worthy purchase. If you like Witcher games, this might be a 50/50 roll.			",138,16,5,19,9,3,12

												To anyone who has played the first 2 Gothic games and liked them: This is the closest we will get to a successor for that specific type of game we crave.To anyone else: This is a action-RPG with a few differences that IMO make it worth the price to play it:1. Both Enemies and resources/consumables are finite meaning that there is no ''absurd grinding just to take one big baddie'', but at the same time the difficulty of the quests and monster placements have a nice curve to them so that you will most likely clear them in roughly the same order anyway. It's just that knowing that there's a natural end in sight aka: ''there's nothing left to kill'' makes the experience feel like your presence matters more in the world.2. While the first point isn't all that unique having that in a Open-World does give it more of a niche that other bigger titles like the TES's don't have.3. Item placements ( such as in chests or just laying around ) are static so after finishing it once ( or looking it up ) you can get a rough idea of where this and that weapon/consumables are, but while other may see this as ''lacking in replay value'' I see it as ''Nice gonna try to beat that tougher opponent to get a head-start next time'' since this again plays with the good difficulty they have. Also a lot of the good weapons have a pretty high stat requirement so you can't just go straight to one of the top weapons in game and use it immediately.And now some cons:1. The story tries to follow from the ending of Gothic 3 ( the neutral ending btw ) but at the same time try to be a new ''Original IP'' since they didn't have the license anymore after the 3rd game which might make fans of the Gothic games feel a uncanny valley effect throughout this game.2. The story itself is also IMO kinda lackluster, which is a shame but then again the preceding games mentioned above while having IMO a few better characters were sorta the same in overall quality so if you're searching for deep and engaging characters/story then you might want to look elsewhere. ( Although while not deep this and it's predecessors do have probably the most down-to-earth or normalish feeling cast ever IMHO)			",178,53,2,32,16,8,24

												In short: Good RPG with a bad first impressionCons: The game has a bad first impression because it does not explain itself all that well, so if you are new to Piranha Bytes games you might end up googling a little, wich is always anoying. The other thing is that, in the beginning you are weak as a kitten and the world is very harsh place,but in time however you will become more powerfull and exploring the world will get easier. That for some people is a gamebreaker, or atleast a turn off. Games usually are easy at beginning and get harder by the end, but here the game is hard at beginning and gets ""somewhat"" easier towards the end. Atleast if you use your experience points right.You see, you can not be good at everything, you have to choose a path and stick to it.Pros: In my opinion the fact that you are really weak at the beginning makes levelling up and getting stronger much more rewarding. The world is beautifully crafted and intresting, making it fun explore. Every quest feels meaningful and gives you a reason to go on, no quest feels filler. The storyline is kinda dull but the politics bethween factions still kept me interested. Menu system, abilities and the fighting mecanics are really good, but those are hard to get into because the game does not explain itself. There is crafting to be had too, which i really like, and it can be really profitable on this game where everything is expensive.I love this game and give it 8/10 but it is not for everyone.

												I have spent a decent amount of time in Risen but have not yet finished the main story. However I will give an overview of what like and dislike so far.Pros:- Interesting story- Differing factions - Interesting side questsSo so:- Combat can seem quite clunky and awkward when facing multiple enemies - Fairly steep learning curve Cons:- Deceptively small world - Not much to do outside of the quests I do recommend this game but ideally would pick it up on a sale as £8 feels a bit steep			",134,41,0,19,14,4,26

												Learn to save early, and often... Random spike booby trap came out of the ground with no warning for an insta-kill. Second time round I noticed the snail transformation just lying on the ground fortunately. Game is a 6/7 out of 10, not the best RPG i've played, The main charachters voice acting is poor, and annoying, The exploration of the map isn't overly rewarding as you'll late have to trek back there for a quest, so may as well save the time. And the story line is filled with monotanous fetch quests... Not sure why I like this game at all, probably for the sheer mention of magic, Titans, and Gods, which i've yet to see any of by the way...			",193,32,4,38,9,4,18

												Just finished it.Positives:- Good quality vs price: Well worth the money- Mostly had fun playing through it. - At one point the sword upgrade was broken (I had an item which boosted the sword by one and apparently there's a known bug for this) but there is an easy to access in game cheat system... which also greatly helps once you're bored with the game and just want to get through it (for me that was after about 32 hours)Negatives:- A little too long. It feels like they intentionally make you run around the world a lot to lengthen the game and at some point there are so many strong enemies that give you so much XP that you start wondering why you did all the small silly quests for 100 XP, when killing a single lizard gives you 320 xp.- Quests malfunction sometimes and then become unclear.- Not as polished as say SkyRim, sometimes quests aren't really clear. Little side quests do not show up all the time. Then again the level of polish it has is to be expected of an older game.			",112,8,8,12,20,0,24

												Well, where to start? I will begin by saying I enjoyed this game very much. RATE: 8.5/10 (easily)The TL;DR is that Risen is an unforgiving 3rd person RPG. (By unforgiving i mean you will die a lot. Saving is your best friend).I won't do a pro vs con in a list fasion but I will state a couple things that I did like about the game and a couple things I didn't like.What I LIKED about Risen is how your character develops. Trainers are required to upgrade skills and you can choose any path/style you desire. Having said that, your choices do get limited by which path you choose to progress the story in. Another aspect I liked is the ""unforgivingness"" of the game that I previously mentioned. It makes the game feel very ""true"" or ""real"", like death is around the corner at any moment. And this goes on throughout the entire game, there is no point at which you can amass gear or items to become a god in the Risen universe. Your character will always be on par with the strongest enemy along the story quests. The story was enjoyable and is a good premise for future plots. The characters you meet are enjoyable and create a desire to quest.What I DISLIKED about Risen mostly is the ""unforgivingness"" of the game I previously mentioned. Its like a love/hate relationship. I can admit to cursing at the monitor at certain situations. Thankfully the game has a built in auto-save at points in which they know you are probably going to die. There was only 1 bug that upset me, I was leveling my skill while wearing a ring that gave me +1 in that skill and the trainer stopped training me 1 point too early (so I only had 6/10 towards the skill instead of 7/10 because i changed the ring i was wearing). It was only a minor inconvenience.Having said all this I RECOMMEND this game as a pick up. Enjoy. :)			",19,4,0,10,0,0,1

												If you are looking for a great RPG in a more classic way, with no ""flashy kill cam moves"", as seen in todays' most games, look no further. The world is breathing, colorful and with great variety. And so is the quest system. Few of them follow the standard gather and kill pattern. Most are connected with each other and do a good part in taking you along your adventure, exploring the whole island of Risen. With no doubt the best part of Risen is the epic sound track. It's on par with background tunes from the elder scrolls, perhaps even surpassing it, as it drags you in, the moment you are starting your adventure. Voice acting (german) is top notch, with great dialogues which will be good for a laugh more than once. Promised ;) Playtime is around 15h-30h (normal) depending on your playstyle. Don't get turnoff by your first footsteps in the begnning. This is yet one of these few games which don't take your hand. It's not easy, but go on. You won't regret it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're thinking about playing Risen 2, definitely play this one first. Exploring the giant island while fighting all sorts of monsters and learning about the game's story is really fun and rewarding. :)			",166,43,3,26,11,2,17

												Very gritty well rounded RPG! Kind of reminds me of The Witcher and Dragon Age in parts, although it's just short of being as good as either of those titles. Still a solid game which I strongly recommend to all fans of RPGs!			",84,14,1,6,1,0,6

												Short Summary of my opinion on this game:Found this game surprisingly enjoyable, it has recieved somewhat mixed reviews, but overall, for its price the game is entertaining, did not become stale, was challenging enough and kept my interest through to the end.does not neccesarily do anything exceptionally well, but it does not fail at anything either. Purchased for under £5 and definitly got my moneys worth.if you have spare time and there is no other RPG/action games out there calling for your attention, you will not be dissapointed.

												Do you enjoy RPGs? Do you like becoming one with your character? Did you love Gothic I and II, but you were dissapointed by Gothic III? Then this game is meant for you. Risen has all the elements we loved from Gothic 1 (lockpicking minigame, combat evolution as you level up your sword-fighting skill, etc.) with upgraded graphics and sick optimization. You can run this game on a 7 year old machine no problem. Too bad the story is always the same, regardless what your choices were. So far, I've played this for 27 hours and I must say, I've enjoyed all of them. I reccomend it to anyone who likes Gothic series. It will bring back some old memories and nostalgia, as it did to me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For a game that's just a bit more than 2 GB in size, Risen has a lot to offer. It surely isn't as good or big as other games of similiar kind, like Gothic, but it is a fun game to play. You can join one of two different fractions and become an expert in quite a few different styles. Either be a warrior, a thief, a mage or a monk. Since levels and skill points are limited, you can not get everything, making it interesting to try again with a different gameplay style.The game has its flaws, the story is weak, the gameplay is sometimes choppy and difficulty seems unbalanced at points, but overall this is a game one should try and see if its suits you.

												Risen is a very intersting game. It feels strange at first and combatis very cumbersome, however if you stick with it for a littel while it realy grows on you and you realise how deep the game actually goes. This is a game where plowing through the first hour or so is essential to really appreciate the rest the game has to offer. The graphics are nothing to shout about and the games doesn't have any stand-out original features. But fans of the Gothic series will feel right at home with this brilliantly complex and rewarding RPG. Give it a chance, at first it seems horrible and heavy, but after the first hour or so it really shines as a deep and fun experience.Pros:- Lush, densely packed environments to explore- Tactical combat with strategy- Very addictive gameplayCons:- Controls feel heavy- No controller support- Takes a while to really get into anything interesting ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm going to admit this straight off - this is one of the most memorable games I've played, but I didn't finish it. In fact, I really have no idea what the ultimate aim of the game is.See, you're shipwrecked and washed up on the shores of a brutal location. The weather's beating down on you, wreckage strewn along the beach, and everything – everything - seems hostile. Hell, you don't even have any shoes.No shoes bothered me.I mean, Really bothered me.Look, I have no idea how or why this happened, but after an hour I slowly came to realise my game had metamorphosed into the epic tale of one man's quest to find appropriate footware. But this game is biblically hard. Absolutely every bit of equipment you win is a tooth and nail struggle. Yet because of that, every item is also a personal triumph. But the game as intended - the exploration, the factions, the intrigue - they'd all become a means to an end in my desperate need to find a pair of shoes. I was a man with nothing. And all I wanted was some shoes.Any shoes.In the end I was given some. It took bloody hours and I did lots of interesting things, but all that ""saving the world"" stuff became a secondary consideration. And once I found some shoes, I basically stopped. But it was a very personal quest for me, definitely the most bizarre and unexplable thing I've ever done in a game, but also one of the most absurdly fulfilling too.This is a game and I have no idea what the real point is. But it's a game that let me ignore all its careful design, and instead make it about one man who becomes unhinged by personal disaster and relentlessly pursues a mad obsession to own a pair of shoes.Now, That's an Open World game.

												How can a game be so fun when I'm constantly quicksaving and quickloading?! Great story, challenging combat. The loading screen doesn't lie when it says to save often. I die all the time but I'm still having a blast. You start as a washed up stowaway and soon work your way up the rank of a band of bandits or get yourself into a mystical order. Magic, swords, shields, bows, crossbows, a plethora of skills for you to customize your playstyle. I think this is one game I'm totally going to finish!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I enjoyed this game all the way through. From the developers of the Gothic series... which you can tell because it's pretty much like those games but modernized. The combat is improved, and the graphics are very much improved. For 2009 this game looks amazing (with the graphics turned all the way up). The game isn't perfect... there are some glitches, but they're mostly minor and don't affect gameplay much. A big chunk of this game is about exploring. Most of the game you're exploring a huge island, and later parts of the game you'll be in ruins and underground caves. Most of the enemies you kill stay dead, but at the beginning of a chapter some enemies do respawn. The combat is challenging, but satisfying. The story starts alittle dull, but by the end it's very interesting. If you're up for a challenging Action-RPG, and your computer can handle it, then I highly recommend Risen.

												This is an epic begining of a thrilling series of Risen. It may looks like an old ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game, but ITS NOT. I really recommend this game for those who like to play a good story for a long time and its complete different from new games. And its little challenging.This, and Gothic series, are the games of my childhood and i still love them.10/10			",55,8,0,15,13,2,10

												A decent open-world RPG with an okay plot. The combat despite being clunky at times is fun and enjoyable.The dungeons are a treat, you actually get to use a bunch of your spells to pass them. They should've added more of it, they were one of the most enjoyable parts of the game.Also welcome to the pothead island.			",236,33,4,52,31,3,49

												While it might have slipped off the radar for most, Risen is well-worth the look. It's one of those games that is more a self-contained experience than a sprawling life-sucking all-encompassing phenomenon: you're a castaway on a tropical island; survive! If you're coming here from Oblivion or Morrowind or other ""open world"" RPGs, the main thing to note is that Risen is handcrafted. Every little dungeon, treasure trove, and enemy was placed in the world by a designer - and as such, it's full of little secrets. It's a treasure hunt wrapped up in a gorgeous and atmospheric island adventure - just be prepared for the letdown ending, which doesn't live up to the rest of the game.			",449,114,15,108,81,0,136

												A game that has been given a lot of critisism along the years since its first release on Xbox 360, for a lot of different reasons ._The graphics were below avrege at the time;_Its bad combat design;_The story itself was bad for a lot of people...I dont really agree with these points at all, i acctualy enjoyed the game a lot, this is the type of game that in my opinion its completelly underated as a lot of people hate the game itself. I suggest to try this game, its really cheap during sales so if u are a fan of RPGs u should deffnetly give it a try.			",214,42,8,25,12,3,9

												This is one game I do NOT recommend. The way the game is laid out as far as leveling up and distributing skills is horrible. You do not have any flexibility in it what so ever. When you set game on easy it is not easy but stays the same as normal. Same hit points on easy and normal. The game is WAY to dark even if you adjust brightness all the way, the plants all blend together making it extremely hard to see anything coming up on you. If you have any eye sight problems, DO NOT get this game. You will NOT be able to see everything correctly.Note: This game was even tried on a hd 40inch t.v. screen to make the picture bigger and NO help.			",13,3,0,22,0,0,0
