												My wife has played through every race/ class combination possible, hence the 1300+ hours on record.  She has replayed the dwarf and human noble origins repeatedely just to know all possible outcomes (her favorite seems to be a dwarf rogue).  She is so good at playing the game she can run through it up to the final battle over a weekend (friday night, saturday, done sunday noon)  i was only able to write this review because she is at work.  ...I miss my wife, can i have her back yet? I guess i should recommend it because she plays it so voraciously?EDIT: 4/8/15: HOLY FRAK PEOPLE! :D  for those of you thave have commented: Yes the wife thinks i am like Alistair sometimesYes i have a beardYes she slays the dragons in the family...so far... but I am slowly catching up. (well she doesn't slay them directly per se, but she sets up the dragon to be slain by some warrior/fighter, typically Aveline, Fenris, or Iron Bull) DA 2 was just as time consuming as DA: O (but with only 700-ish hours gameplay over 2014; less choices with char-gen means less replayability for her, only 6-8 characters made this time instead of 30-40) DA: I ( which i just got for her in Feb. as a late X-mas gift) has totally consumed her time (AGAIN!) but with her new job she has only managed 300 hours (i estimate about 25 of it are my two characters) She is frustrated she cannot romance Varricshe loves Iron Bull  (who the hell doesn't he's got the best lines, along with Sera) i told her no DLC until the main storyline is finished,  she gave me puppy dog eyes, i haven't cracked...yet... I may be a bit biased but yes i do believe she is very awesome and I can geek out with her without her eyes glazing over, alternatively i dont Glaze-out either when she geeks out at me.  ...so, hooray?  for totally life consuming video games...?

												Disclaimer: This is my favorite game of all time, so I apologize for any obsessive fan-girling that may occur within this review.tl;dr Pro's and Con's list at the bottom.Theres so many things I could say about this game, I love it so much.  A majority of my time playing is on console, where I easily have 500+ hours, as well as every achievement in the game as well as additional content.  I'm not much of a reviewer (this being my first lengthy one), so to keep it simple I'll seperate it into sections.Character Creation/Leveling-     There is a fair bit of customization when you create your character.  There are 3 races to choose from (Human, Dwarf, and Elf) which all give different bonus stats.  From there, you will pick your characters class (Warrior, Rogue, or Mage).  All of those classes expand at later levels, with your choice of sub-classes for each (unlocked at levels 7 and 14), which are unlocked by doing different things in the game, or learning them from certain characters.  So no, you aren't born with the ability to magically understand how to be a Bard, or a Templar, you need to actually be taught by someone, or learn the knowledge elsewhere.  Visual choices are alright, standard RPG things like different hair, different eyes, all of which will be covered by a helmet/cowl anyway no doubt.  Either way, you could always grab a mod or two for more character visuals, but I'll try to keep this review on the base game alone.  When you level up there are hefty decisions to be made.  Not only are there abilities for you to use in combat, there are also different abilties for out of combat purposes.  Are you going to put that point into your combat knowledge, unlocking the next tier of weapon abilites?  Or are you going to put it in lockpicking?  The next dungeon might have a door you can't quite pick yet.  Choose carefully...Story-     The best thing about this game is the enthralling story!  From character creation, based on your race, and class even changes how your story begins.  Are you a human noble, living cozy in your castle?  Perhaps a dwarf whose fallen on hard times, and has gone down a life of crime.  Maybe even a mage, stripped from your family and sent off to the Circle of Magi to be watched by the Templars.  In most cases, different events from your ""Origin"" story come back to either aid/hinder you based on how you handled them.  This game is full of heart-wrenching decisions, where you need to decide between being the good guy, or getting something that would be extremely helpful on your quest/not put you in danger.  There's a fair bit of situations where there is no clear-cut decision to be a good guy, someone is getting hurt and it will be your fault, and you can be sure it will change how certain people treat you/your story in general.Characters-     I might have lied about the story being the best part, because the different characters in the game are amazing.  I could go hours talking about the different personalities characters have, but I'll stick just to your party in this, because that's who you'll spend most of the time with obviously.  Your party as it starts getting full, is a ragtag group of different people, with various different outlooks on things. Literally, you might have an apostate witch, a templar, a chantry zealot, and a drunken dwarf all at once.   Each party member has a relationship bar, which goes up or down depending on your decisions and how you talk to them, which in turn effects how they treat you/open up to you.  You could make someone spit in your face and leave the party for good, or even turn and attack you, or they could open up to you about their past giving you a special quest to help them with something personal.  On top of balancing decisons on how it will effect you, and the world around you, you also have to think of how your party members will react to it.  Each character in you party has a lot of diologue opportunities, and if you pay close attention you might be able to find them a gift relevant to something they have said, or perform an action they mentioned.  You can even have relationships with some of the characters, and watch a blooming love grow, as well as listen to the rest of your party snicker and banter about you and soandso last night in a tent together.  If one party member is growing affectionate of you, you can see them get jealous when they discover your relationship with another.You know characters are a big part, when some of the ADD ON CONTENT IS FOR THE CHARACTERS.  Some of the additional content in the game focuses on a certain characters past, and another on his/her events after the story.  Of course based on what you did in the story, it effects it as well.Gameplay-     If you played Dragon Age 2, don't expect this game to be as hack and slash as that one was.  This is by far much more tactical.  One of the coolest features is allowing you to set up your party members tactics in certain situations.  You can set a condition where if 4 enemies are clumped together, your mage shoots a fireball in the center of them, or if your tank gets below 20% health, your Warrior activates an ability to take aggro off of him.  On harder difficulties, you might find yourself hitting the spacebar key pretty quick to pause the game, so you can asses the situation, and assign party members specific orders.Difficulty-     If your new to the game, start on the easiest mode for sure.  This game is brutal on harder difficulties, and while the ability to set your AI party's tactics is beneficial, you will need to be able to know what abilities do what, the different sub-classes to branch down..etc.  Even on easy, you'll find yourself in some situations pausing, and getting some much needed healing done, or think on how to take down a challenging foe.  (Seriously, f*** Revenants).  And remember to be careful when setting your Mage's tactics, there IS FRIENDLY FIRE with mage abilities.  That fireball you just set to go off when the enemies clumped?  You killed them, but your rogue with them.Glitches/Bugs-     There are of course some glitches in the game, scaling from minor textures on occasion, to something that could ruin a combat situation and make you die.  Some of the notable ones include:-Enemies not spawning in missions if you leave a set area/charge their spawn-Your attack speed going back to default if it gets insanely high-Your character not being able to get good placement in combat, making him run in place-A certain party members arm getting stuck in place like she's waiting for a bird to perch on it-Gifts not giving the appropriate amount of points on the relationship barAnd you might find a couple others.  Fortunately, the major ones are fixable by mods that are readily avalible on sites such as Nexus mods.  However as I said before, I'm reviewing this based on the base game.Pros and Cons-Pros:-Amazing story!-Heart-wrenching decisions, some with no clear-cut good or bad answer.-Characters and how they react to what you do!-Your party cast, and the relationship bar!-Manageable AI tactics for your party!-Harder difficulties are brutally challenging.-You can wrangle nugs!Cons:-A few glitches/bugs.  Nothing that ruins your gaming experience for more than a few moments.-The lack of sun you'll be getting isn't good for your complexion.-After playing this Dragon Age 2 is a big let-down. :(My rating of course, is a 10/10!  While there are a few bugs and glitches, they aren't so notable that it ruins your gaming experience more than just a few minute, if that.  The story is just phenominal!  The game is challenging, on the harder difficulties each battle you win feels like an achievement, and you find yourself stocking up and using everything you have on boss battles, most of the time narrowly making it through.  This game is a must play if you haven't already!			",83,9,0,26,12,3,29

												Words cannot describe how much I love this game, so allow me to describe it in words. Crafted by the same studio that has made some of my favorite RPGs of all time, Dragon Age answers the question of whether or not Bioware can create a compelling medieval fantasy RPG that isn't D&D based. The answer is a resounding yes. While containing many of the trappings of past RPGs like Neverwinter Nights and Baldur's Gate, Dragon Age works its own magic by offering three classes that can be customized by an almost infinite amount, six different origin stories for the player character, and doing away with the traditional good/evil morality mechanic in favor of one based on individual party approval or disapproval of your actions.Each character in your party is believable and compelling, likeable for different reasons, and some can be romanced or change their outlook depending on how the story progresses. Every major questline can have different outcomes depending on player choices and it's this feeling of agency in the world that keeps the replay value in this game. Dragon Age has often been called a dark RPG and rightly so, as the story is much less straight forward than a typical RPG. Often you will find yourself having to deal with choices where there is no clear cut ""good"" or ""evil"" outcome which is part of why player choice feels so meaningful.And on top of all that, the game is a lot of fun. I remember the first time playing this game and saying ""this is the game that Neverwinter Nights 2 should have been!"" It still holds up, probably even more so against its sequel which in some ways is unfortunate. If you love western RPGs and loved the past work of Bioware, you will love this game. I give it two severed darkspawn thumbs way up!			",511,204,20,89,71,8,100

												Dragon Age: Origins, debatably the last good game of Bioware's making, is a very intricate and detailed, although at sometimes cliche, foray into an action-adventure medieval setting.Gameplay - Personally, this was my favorite part of the game. I loved the real time with pause system, and always have with other games such as KOTOR. My only complaint is that melee and ranged did not seem to shine as well as the magic system, especially with mana versus stamina. Often, I played as Morrigan instead of the Warden just because it was much more fun. The tactics system is well-done but the AI could use some more work, especially with rogues - even though they were supposed to go behind enemies for backstabs, more often than not, I had to do it myself. I feel as though the wide amount of abilities would easily allow for a just-as-fun second or third playthrough.Story - The overarching storyline of the Blight was predictable, but I feel as though the game shines in the whole adventure there (as you don't ""directly"" deal with the blight until the ending) was much better. The characters involved in the story were well-written and the many dialogue options involved with most major NPCs was refreshing, although expected of Bioware's team. One of my favorite parts of the game related to story was the lore behind the whole games. As a TES fan, especially Morrowind, I really enjoyed the codex and each of its entries. The Fade was a unique concept which, although tedious in-game, was a great concept and a take on the supernatural that I hadn't seen in any game.Characters - I should preface this by saying that my main party consisted of myself, a human noble, Morrigan, Sten, and Shale. I opted for Shale instead of a vanilla character simply because I wanted a tank in my party. I tried to talk to each character a lot individually though, besides the secret companion, who I opted to not join my party. I romanced Zevran and Alistair (in order to take the throne) and felt that the amount of dialogue options and their own quests were really well-done. My advice for the game, if you want to be much more into the story and characters, is to set it to easy/normal and play with whom you like.That about wraps it up. You can easily spend 50 hours in a single play-through if you do more of the quests than I did, such as the rogue mage group, chantry quests, and each of the unique quests that your party members give you (Sten's sword, Flemeth, etc). It's very worth your time.			",140,26,4,36,13,1,18

												Dragons Age is well a put together RPG that will immerse you in the story and you will invest time in developing the characters that accompany you on your quest.  The biggest downside to the game is the story is tried, tired and done a thousand times over.  You the hero are on quest to destroy the dark spawn that is wreaking havoc on the land.  This being its biggest downfall does not make this a bad game at all.  I had over 70hours in one play through and with all the decision making you encounter this game will surely keep you amused for multiple plays.  One of the best combat systems I've seen  you can not only setup the AI to have your companions on the quest do what you like but you can fully take control of them which in my opinion is a huge advantage.  The combat system is a little bit of learning curve but once you get the hang of it you will love it and enjoy the simpleness of how your characters act and follow your directions in the heat of some best battles you will see in an RPG.  Bioware did an excellent job in creating a game you can fully plunge yourself into and get behind.			",57,2,8,14,5,0,19

Reviews for the Deaf and Hard of HearingOverall Rating: 9/10Gameplay Rating: 9/10Accessibility Rating: 8/10Overall rating is a combination of the gameplay (mechanics and story) and accessibility (how the game includes deaf/hoh gamers).Overall GameplayDA:O's game format is very much in line with similar games by Bioware, ranging from Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic I/II, Mass Effect, etc.  If you're familiar with those games, you will understand the controls of this game.  If you haven't experienced those games, I would suggest each of them in addition to the Dragon Age line.These tend to be very story-rich games, and DA:O is no exception.  Starting out, you create a character in a very scaled-back Dungeons and Dragons format.  You decide between male/female, elf/human/dwarf, and warrior/mage/rogue.  As you progress, there are further specializations you can pick up, such as a rogue bard or a mage healer.At almost 30 hours of play, I am around 15-20% complete with the main storyline, so there's significant play time for the cost of the game.  Further, replay value comes from different character types, gender, and race, as well as modified slightly by the abilities of your character, such as intimidation or persuasion abilities.I am enjoying this game and will continue to play it beyond one playthrough.General AccessibilityDA:O primarily uses QWES to strafe/move and A/D to turn the camera.  I tend to hold right click to manipulate the camera and just use W to run forward.  The complexity of games like this require more keyboard use than an FPS, so different windows, HUDs, and menus can be accessed by various keys.  All keys can be rebound, making it a little more convenient for mobility-related issues.In line with all games of this type from Bioware, the combat in the game can be paused so that you can issue orders to your party members.  In combat, you can pause as often as you need to, which helps balance the game experience out for all gamers, regardless of needs.Subtitles & CaptionsSpeech is captioned in this game.  Important text is captioned so that you can read it readily and up-front and ambient speech (such as NPCs or banter between supporting characters in your party) shows up over their heads and can be read as you do other things.  Captions do not use color-coding, but conversations happen sequentially rather than simultaneously, and display the character on screen so you know who is talking.One complaint is that these background conversations, captions may be missed entirely, depending on the camera angles.  These are usually interesting or funny conversations that help develop the characters and their relationships, but, more than once, I have only caught the end of them.  Part of the draw of games like this is getting immersed in the environment, but this is hard to do when the mechanics of the game do not permit it.There is nothing in the game that requires being able to hear or hear well that I am aware of.Chatting/CommunicatingDA:O is single-player.No rating.

 “Dragon Age: Origins is simply one of those games you have to play no matter if you like that genre or not.""  TL;DR:  Buy it. Please. Note: This review doesn’t contain any spoiler. I did in fact play the DLC, but this Review only focuses on the main game.  Feel free to add me on Steam, if you have questions about DA:O!    Graphic 7/10 I guess that’s the weakest aspect of DA:O, and it still is better than many games of that genre. Animations are quite okay, nothing fancy here, but the atmosphere of the game is unbelievable. You’ve ever dreamt of a battlefield that actually looks like one? Here you have it. Even though you’ll come along some weird animations, bad textures and some bugs (typically for such huge games), you won’t be disappointed. It’s still beautiful. Sound 10/10 You may can say that it’s not the best looking game, but you can’t argue with me that it doesn’t sound awesome. First things first: Yes, every character is voiced and every actor did a pretty good job. I couldn’t remember any bad one. The background music is excellent. You’ll immediately fall in love with it. I could list 100 things about the sound part, but I guess a 10/10 stands for itself.  Story: 9/10 Story is always a hard one to judge. It’s often personal preference if you like it or not. If you see the deeper meanings or if you actually care about the background of everyone around you. The story is damn well presented and is overall superb. If you break it down it in fact would come down of being just another “We got invaded by some f*cking weird boss monster and you have to save the world bla bla” and even if it may look like it is just that, it really is more. Just explore it on your own and you’ll see how good it actually is, if you just spend enough time.  Gameplay: 10/10 Let me give you a little bit of a backstory here for all of you undecided ones: I NEVER played a round-based game before DA:O and I had my reasons for it. I always thought it’s boring, repetitive and focuses too much on that strategy part instead of action. Oh boy was I proved wrong. It was so easy to get into that game but you had so many features to find your style of playing. I don’t even know what I should tell you first about. You can create your own little party by choosing which companions will accompany you throughout the game. You’ll meet most of them during the game and you can interact with them to the fullest. And I mean to the fullest. (You can date almost all of them.) In conversations you can choose which answer is the most suitable. But be careful: You can even loose the chance to recruit a companion if you chose to just not let him / her come with you, kill him / her or you just forgot to complete that one quest. If you ever wanted to try out a Game like this, do it. It’s the best by far. Difficulty: 4 up to 9 As I said before: It introduces you quite well and I as a beginner never felt overwhelmed. There are many difficulty levels to choose and the hardest one is just pure pain. And that’s the way it should be. For my first playthrough I chose “Easy” and there were still some hard fights that require you to pause (By pressing spacebar) and think through your strategy. It’s for everyone.  I really recommend reading some class guides (There are a lot on youtube if you’re too lazy to read like me)!!  Only the DLC gives you the option to reskill. Or you have to download the mod. Notable: - I won’t say that there aren’t some bugs. You can’t expect a game this big without some minor bugs. But there wasn’t a single game braking one.- Good for newcomers to the genre- Runs smoothly - Complete Edition costs less than 10 bucks on Sale.- I completed it in around 70 hours. (And another 20 spent on the DLCs). You WILL spent a lot of time in this-  One of THE best games I’ve ever played so far  Conclusion: I BEG you to at least try it out. I didn’t like those games too, but DA:O changed my mind and became my favorite game. You won’t regret it! Thanks for reading, if there are any questions leave a comment below. Feel free to add me if you want to chat about the game, my other reviews or just for fun. Have a great Day!  ",169,36,4,24,8,0,9

												Great story, great graphics, and a great game. Dragon Age is a phenomenal RPG that offers an extensive and vast story that really sinks you into it. The expansion packs only add to this. Non-linear and full of side quest to keep you busy when you decided to take a break from the main quest. It's a beautiful game with lush environments as well as great voice acting. The combat is smooth and the ability to pause and coordinate your attacks is brilliant. I had a wonderful time with this game and I have gotten a lot of replay ability with it. One of the best RPG games I've played.			",371,58,4,49,2,1,15

												Excellent game with high replayability. One of my all time favorites. Still, I'll be honest and list the flaws. First, the level editor is nowhere near as intuitive as Neverwinter Nights, but given that these days a prepackaged editor is rare enough as is, I suppose I shouldn't complain. Awakenings is buggy as hell and Witch Hunt is far too short, although I rather liked Ariane and Finn as companions. The ""hard choice"" at the end of Origins feels contrived to me, although I can't really get into why without spoilers. For what it's worth, I highly recommend the Dragon Age Redesigned and Improved Atmosphere mods. Also, there is a mod avaliable to skip the Fade. You'll probably want to install that after the first playthrough. Still an excellent game, and you should buy it before Dragon Age Inquisition comes out. From what I've heard, you'll also probably want to skip DA2.			",58,11,1,23,6,1,24

												The Dragon Age-franchise and The Elder Scrolls-franchise are the main reasons I love gaming. They are works of art.1st playthrough (incl. DLC's): 100 hours!To me this Dragon Age game is one of the best RPG's of all time, because: - of the wonderful story- of the excellent music- of the loot- of the great choices you are able to make in conversations- of the tactical combat choices you have to make- you can have relationships with your companions... ;) Not at the same time tho, because they get jealous ;)- I'm a completionist- I love a well-thought-out game and the choices you make really matter- I love a game that is thorough-going- of the magnificent voice-actingRecognize yourself in this list? BUY AND PLAY THIS GAME :)			",53,20,0,12,3,0,1

 “Join us, brothers and sisters. Join us in the shadows, where we stand vigilant!”Dragon Age: Origins is an excellent role-playing game with a truly epic campaign and great tactical gameplay. It offers a rich and vivid world, loads of mature themes and memorable characters. The storytelling and dialogues are witty and engaging, the music is inspiring and you will be deeply involved in the compelling gameplay. The different decisions and conversation options in combination with your individual character background allow you to proceed through the game in several ways resulting in a high replayability. Amusing quotes:  “We now have a dog and Alistair is still the dumbest one in the party.”  “Let's show them our hearts, and then show them theirs.” Trivia:Dragon Age: Origins is often considered the spiritual successor to the Baldur's Gate series of games, which took place in the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting of the Dungeons & Dragons franchise.Achievements:The game has no Steam achievements.

												After owning this and playing the hell out of it on the PS3 I decided it was finally time to see how well the PC version was made and get a couple DLCs I hadn't played. Right off the bat I noticed a massive difference from my console version in the load times. The PC version is a blink of an eye compared to my PS3 sounding like it was ready to take flight playing this with load times becoming increasingly annoying as you play through it. The graphics and performance overall are far superior as well and the mouse/keyboard controls are nice. It does take a little bit of getting used to rotating the look with either the keyboard, or the mouse (you have to hold down the right button to look around), but you get used to it fast enough. Not to mention the ability to quicksave and not wait 5 seconds like on consoles.As for the game itself, this is one of my all-time favorite RPGs. Mostly because I love the adult and mature content that it provides with the characters. No I'm not talkinng about sex, although you can hook up with other characters in your party and even have some grand old same sex encounters. The dialogue and writing in this game feels very realistic and not childish like most RPGs you will play. A lot of good dark humor as well as some smart interactions with the characters. This is what I love most about this series and what I loave about Bioware games in general like Mass Effect.It is fun to mix and match your party as you walk around exploring as they all talk to each other while you walk and have different things to say based on who is in the group. I would highly recommend this game to ALL RPG fans and would suggest buying the Ultimate Edition so that you can get all the DLC on Steam without the hassle of having to go through the Bioware website and getting shafted. The DLC is worth the few extra bucks for a completely new character (got this as a pre-order on PS3 I believe) that adds a lot of humor and their own character quests to the game. The story is farily well done and has a lot of character quests like most Bioware games that addsdepth to your party. The DLCs expand on some of them and add even more story. Plus you get new items, skills, and characters that can be used in the main campaign. The PC version also offers a decent modding community which can add a lot to the game, or take away some of the tedious things you dislike. This game for me is an easy 9.5/10.

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Dragon Age: Origins Original Release: 2010 Genre Tags: RPG; Strategy; Fantasy; Story-Rich; Epic My Overall Grade: A+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 60-150 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Strong narrative advocates; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Epic RPG enthusiasts REVIEWDragon Age: Origins is an immersive action/strategy RPG with a deep, intricate story and the potential for hundreds of gameplay hours.  If you like plunging yourself into truly epic RPGs which can keep you glued to your computer for days on end, this is one of the best games to play. Right from the start, the massiveness of the game assaults you. Making your standard start-of-an-RPG choices of character race and class will determine which of six origin stories you will play through to open the game.  Each of these stories can take several hours to beat.  And if you are like me, you will need to play them all before deciding which character you will anoint the chosen one which you will play as for the entirety of the campaign.  Who you choose will also affect certain conversations and quests in the main part of the game.Continuing with the theme of massiveness, the narrative and lore elements are truly epic and expansive. The main narrative is well written with great pacing, telling an interesting tale rooted in classic fantasy themes. The characters are diverse and interesting, and each one is given an actual presence in the world. And if you enjoy immersing yourself in the nuances of fantasy gameworlds, you will be pleased to know there is a plethora of lore and backstory. There is so much to learn about.As for the gameworld: it is atmospheric and mystical. There is no gigantic overworld to freely traverse, however. But the locations that do exist are very well designed and are expressive of the setting. And the graphics succeed in painting the picture that is intended, even if they may fall behind the curve as this game begins to age.The gameplay mechanics and the battle system are intricate and elaborate. On the higher difficulties, deep knowledge of interactive effects is necessary for tough battles. Luckily on the lower difficulties, you can get away with only a rudimentary understanding. But as you unlock new abilities and new characters who offer new playable classes, experimenting with different party combinations can help spice up the combat. For any game that lasts over 100 hours, that can be a welcome feature.One of the headlining concepts at the heart of Dragon Age: Origins is the decision system. I alluded to this earlier when I mentioned the diverse origin stories. There are a multitude of decisions to be made throughout the game, most of which have some sort of impact on the gameworld— be it large or small. And to make it better, most of the decisions have no clear “right or wrong,” so you’ll really have to make choices (and not just choose what you know the game wants you to).It is beginning to age, but true quality cannot easily be eroded by the sands of time. If you are a fan of truly epic RPGs, this one is a must-play for you. My only warning is that it is quite verbose and grand in scale, so if you are someone who easily loses interest then you may struggle with the sheer magnitude of the game.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												Dragon Age origins was No 1 and the best .... an absolutely brilliant game! Six character backgrounds to choose to start with and all could be played through for the whole game. Several vastly different endings depending on choices made through the game. Fantastic and witty dialogue with all your companions that you were able to take with you on your adventure. Interactions between the companions that you had with you at random event places. Love scenes with characters that you had started to have a relationship with .... which needed to be be done slowly and well over a long time being aware of three way jealousies and confrontations with other companions.... Brilliantly worked out! Massive Boss battles ... an AI system where you could set up how your companions would automatically react when certain conditions are met. Tough battles that you needed to be strategic about to survive... with a combination of four possible followers fighting with you and needing all the skills of magic, rogue and fighter to make it past all areas.DA Origins had an expansion called Awakening to which you could take a save file from Origins to take you into it ... and you needed to as the enemies in Awakening were at that level and a new game started at awakening started with the same gear you would have had in Origins. So anyone wanting to battle level 30 enemies with a rusty dagger and a robe.... good luck. The Awakening was a good addition a couple of your companions made the trip and could join you if you did all the right things. Certainly it is a smaller game than origins and a different one. But a worthy addition using the same game structure and similar dialogue ... although not as good as origins.The Dragon Age 2 game actually doesn't really have anything to do with the first. Some of the lore is the same ... and from some of the decisions you made in DA O will be represented in some vague background stories. The dialogue was tweaked further but is became convoluted  ... but none of the characters really felt like someone I could relate to. DA 2 had three chapters I completed the first and after 5 -6 tries eventually defeated the massive boss battle in the deep roads against the ARW (Ancient Rock Wraith) This battle was immense! For that the resulting Treasure was a major Disappointment!!!! I had played as a mage up to that point and the robe in the treasure wasn't much different than anything previously. The only character who had decent armor was the dwarf (narrator of the game when cut scenes happened)  who's Armor leveled as he did ... so you would think this dwarf was the protagonist. Then you supposedly won a massive income from your trip into the deep roads such that you bought a house for your self and your companions ... (that I didn't care about) but had no money left, to even buy potions. The only part of DA 2  that I did like was the combat! How they had you fight numerous enemies and the way spells and melee attacks worked was great. But hopeless story and characters that I couldn't care about .... and nothing to do with DA Origins at all very disappointing.			",55,41,0,9,7,0,2

												This is it, right here. This is the RPG to define all other RPGs. Dragon Age: Origins, is personally my favorite RPG of all time. Between the huge amount of hours that I have logged on Steam and the countless hours played on PS3, I have experienced pretty much all you can experience within the game. I guess you could say I'm kind of a big deal. Dragon Age: Origins is one of the best written RPGs ever made, showcasing BioWare at its finest. With a deep and intricate story, varied and memorable characters, and deep gameplay using the d20 system. If you like fantasy at all, then you will enjoy what this game has to offer.

												I heard about this game a lot, having seen it on several ""Top RPG's of All Time"" lists and knowing it to be a personal favourite of many people. Suffice it to say, I was pretty excited to give it a run. I went from being  sorely dissapointed  to  becoming a big fan , so I thought it would be helpful to share my experience.  Note: I haven't finished the game or all of the DLC's yet, so this is a tentative review.  Early impressions Graphics sucked (even with beautification mods), combat was okay but certainly not ""tactical"", what the hell is this?I kept coming back to the game because, a) I heard so much about it, and b)  every quest has a really well developed narrative to it . Even in what would typically be fetch quests I was invested in participating because I knew the back-story (i.e. You meet a kid who's mother died, and find a quest on the notice board to locate her remains and bring back her amulet, presumably for the kid). It could have been ""kill three sewer rats and report to the tavern"", but it wasn't and that was amazing.Also, right off the start, you're thrown into a pretty epic story. Mid-game impressions After 20 hours in-game, your combat abilities are more fleshed out. Combat begins to feel  a lot  more tactical, because you have several variations in taking on enemies, and you need to use several abilities to win against increasingly difficult foes.Several quests really stand out relative to other RPG's, for instance when I -  begin spoiler -sacrificed an heir-to-the-throne kid's mother so that I could travel to a soul-realm, to battle a demon that was possessing him - making the kid murder people and summon monsters to kill townsfolk - using an outlawed form of magic through a guy I just busted out of a dungeon (because he MAY or MAY NOT have attempted to kill the kids dad/lord), - end spoiler - I was like, damn that was amazing.Little things in this world really come to the fore when you invest the time into it. Certain weapons have entire histories associated with them; codex entries come together to paint a really worth-while narrative picture. Also, you meet a pretty sizable list of interesting characters along your journey. Late-game impressions Not there yet, but I'm sure I will be. TL;DR This is an excellent RPG. Pros+ Awesome writing, even for simple quests+ Interesting history to discover+ Epic story+ Interesting characters throughout+ Decent mod support (but they do not help the dated graphics issue that much)Cons- Graphics are poor, but are sometimes really well done (inconsistent graphic quality?)- Takes a long time before combat is tactically engaging			",120,45,6,19,22,3,35

												This game right here is a prime example of what Bioware does right. The story is rich and even is presented to you differently throughout the game depending on your ""Origin Story"" and choices you've made in the game. The character's all have interesting back-stories and will behave in meaningful ways, depending on your relationship with the character. Even the most boring character for me, Sten, was still interesting enough that talking to him about his past and race's history didn't feel like a chore. Combat is simple enough, and while it doesn't have the same level of involvement or 'Flare' as some other games, it's strategic and satisfying. Graphics are pretty good, and with mods and a decent computer, you can really improve the atmosphere of the game.The amount of content is impressive, even by RPG standards. I got roughly 60-some hours on one play-through, and I didn't even bother to complete all the quests. While on that topic, side-quests in this game are well-done as well. Each side-quest usually has some kind of back story, and more often than not, rewards you with some kind of armor or weapon that you couldn't find in the vendor stores. One of my favorite side-quests (and I'll try not to spoil it) is when you battle several different Revents, or Corrupted Warrior Spirits, toretrieve this bass♥♥♥♥♥armor set called the Juggernuat. The rewards and backstory of the quests made it feel like it somehow tied into the actual story, making it much less painful for those 100% completionists.Dragon Age Origins is one of Bioware's best works (my personal favorite), and makes me wish Mass Effect took more from Dragon Age in terms of storytelling and interesting quests. If you're a Bioware fan, RPG fan, or even just looking for a good game to get immersed in, look no further... Dragon Age is worth wasting hours of your life away.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dragon Age: Origins is old-school. Before achievements and trophies, a role-player's greatest achievement was working the system to build the most broken, overpowered character possible within the constraints of whatever edition of Dungeons & Dragons the game was based on. Origins is a solitary experience; you'll isolate yourself from the outside world, staying up nights and well into the morning because when this game grabs you, it simply won't let go.This is a game that's been in development for what seems like forever, and it shows. BioWare's own Mass Effect was far more visually impressive, particularly in the dialogue sequences, where Dragon Age's facial animations and character models can seem stiff and wooden. Then there's the odd decision to go so over-the-top with the blood. Blood plays an important role in the world's unique fiction, but watching your characters relay meaningful lines of speech while splashed with more blood than the prom scene in ""Carrie"" borders on the ridiculous, robbing such scenes of any potential sense of gravitas.That isn't to say that this is an ugly game, by any means. Dragon Age: Origins' landscapes and dungeon interiors are rife with detail and a joy to explore. Combat animations in particular are impressive, as your characters will set themselves before enemies and go through complex motions, with rogues jockeying for position to backstab and warriors forcefully slamming their shields into faces. Colorful kill animations result in dismemberments and decapitations, rewarding you for critical strikes in a far more memorable manner than just a bigger damage number. Then there's the sheer scale of this undertaking. You can easily log a hundred hours exploring every inch of this world, with plenty of incentive to come back again to approach the tale of the Grey Warden from a new perspective and origin story.Your character's origin story, the first steps in your adventure, plays a significant role in how this tale plays out. The tropes of fantasy fiction lie intact, with Dwarves dwelling underground and elves living in the world's forests on the outskirts of human civilization, but these societies are still fleshed-out and made unique. Dwarves have a complex caste system, with the nobility focusing on political advancement while the casteless underclass live in ghettos, struggling to eke out a living as part of the criminal underbelly. Elves who live in human cities reside in closed-off alienages, destined for a life of servitude to the human nobility. Magi live secluded lives of research and study in their towers under the constant watch of the order of Templars, a religious sect tasked with ensuring that magic does not lead to demonic infestation.While your own story is important, the companions that join you play an equally important role. The Grey Warden Alistair, the witch of the wilds Morrigan, and the mysterious minstrel Leliana are your primary romantic options and the game's main supporting characters, though other characters like Sten, the taciturn warrior, are nearly as interesting. Even the dog companion is a full-fledged ally worthy of bringing along, complete with his own inventory and unique abilities. The quality of the voice work ensures that you'll rarely skip through the frequent conversations and inter-party banter. You'll spend lots of time wading through interminably long conversations while getting to know the members of your party, in an effort to improve their approval ratings. Fans of Dungeons & Dragons-styled role-playing adventures may be annoyed that there are only three core character classes and three race options, but there's remarkable depth to the character development system. Each class has a variety of talent options, and four specializations to choose from: Warriors can go weapon and shield or two-handed, Rogues can become archers or dual-wield, and Mages can master a wide variety of spell options. Dragon Age: Origins also provides countless opportunities for challenging, riveting combat sequences where strategy and tactics win out. Again, it's the decisions that make Dragon Age: Origins such a thought-provoking experience. I've played through the game twice now and I still have trouble choosing which companions to take with me on any given adventure. The story has a way of dropping situations in your lap where any of a handful of different options seem viable, with no clear-cut option standing out as the right one. This is due in part to Dragon Age: Origins' lack of a clearly defined moral alignment structure. Characters are generally complex, defying the unrealistically simplistic labels of ""good"" and ""evil,"" and the game is the better for it.There is so much more to Dragon Age: Origins I just don't have room to explain here. Simply know that there are tons of weapons and loot to find, craft, and coat with poison, thousands of quests to take on, storekeepers to intimidate, and NPCs to persuade. If you're a Western-style, fantasy RPG nut, or if you love a great tactical challenge, you simply can't go wrong with Dragon Age: Origins. BioWare has outdone itself once again.

												From the brains of the guys and gals behind Baldur's Gate, Jade Empire, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and Mass Effect emerges this game - Dragon Age: Origins. BioWare certainly knows how to pull off a good RPG, they are clearly not afraid to implement whatever they please to make it a superb experience. Dragon Age: Origins is no different. The game is set in the fantasy world known as Ferelden. A land that for long has been safe from war and suffering and looks like your typical fantasy land with elves, dwarves, wizards, maidens and of course - Dragons.The peace is not to last though, peace is a pretty bad setting to make a game in to be honest. A dark force gathers in the outskirts of the Kingdom and soon the faith of humanity (or what species have you) solely rests on your shoulders. In other words - like every single damn fantasy RPG out there. But hold your unicorns, that does not mean the game is bad does it? No! Making a game in the stereotypical RPG/Fantasy is never a bad thing. As long as it's up to standard with implemented unique features that successfully intertwine with a very good story.BioWare themselves described the game as the spritual successor to Baldur's Gate, at least in the sense of the atmosphere and game setting. I have not played Baldur's Gate, so I can not answer to this. I can however say that the game reminds A lot of Mass Effect and Star Wars: KoTOR, combine that with the general fantasy setting (like Skyrim), some intriguing story and this game is set to blow your brains out. My experience with this game has sadly been... shattered, though. I have throughout the years seriously tried to set my mind on RPG-mode, and just sink myself into this adventure. But I have only finished the game once, and have probably played the start 10 times. I am attracted by the setting and gameplay, but I always seem to end up forcing myself through the game, because I feel that the game MUST be good. Unlike with Mass Effect or any of the Elder Scrolls games for example, I pretty much ended up disliking the game because of my issue. I had the same problem with Bioshock, but this is just me, so it does not make the game any less good. You just have to crave for some RPG goodness, and not rush through it.Just like most BioWare games, you are but one character in a squad/company, and most of the gameplay are dependent on this as a strategic mechanic. It is possible to just ignore the other characters in your company, but this would require your main character to completely carry every fight, which is not optimal. Again, as with all Fantasy RPGs, you get to pick a class; Warrior, Mage or Rogue and build your character from scratch. In Dragon Age you also get to pick race and background, giving even more options as well as unlocking different storylines. This is to make every playthrough a unique experience compared to the previous. Overall BioWare are known as masters at extensive and complex dialogues for their games, often to make you choose a dark or bright path and reflect your options into the upcoming events.What I however Did enjoy about the game was the enormous background history to build the series on, the grim setting, the interactions between the main character and NPC characters, some adult scenery and romance interactions, the depiction of cracks in a fictional society that may or may not be referring to real life scenarios. As the majority of this game attract me I feel that it deserves a positive rating, even though I will probably not play it again due to lack of patience and time.If you love BioWare's games, Fantasy RPG's and are ready to sacrifice dozens of hours for a grand adventure, then this game is likely to entertain.

												This game is like crack minus the tooth rot and risk of imprisonment!  The combat difficulty will leave some hardcore RPG'ers wanting, but this game does allow you to pause during battles so that you can think and strategize and I really enjoy having this ability.  The story behind this game is what really sells it.  The loot, so far, is kind of blah, but I am sure that will improve the further I get into it.  Game runs great on Win 7 64 Bit and I am very pleased with the interface.  I believe I picked this game up during a sale for about $5.00.  Ever tried to get some crack with $5?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There are about a dozen gender/race/class/background choices and a great many combinations in forming your party. The armor and the weapons are exceptionally made and everything shows on your characters. And the graphics are truly beautiful! You have to see the rendering of flames to believe them.Nevertheless, what really stands out is the gameplay.

Sten (a game companion) steals cookies from children ""for their own good""Hailed by many as the best Dragon Age title ever made, this bad boy is the spiritual successor of none other than Baldur's Gate, therefore fans of the aforementioned series will enjoy this game a little bit more than usual.DA's plot is extremely rich with details that unfold slowly after hours and hours of exploration and gameplay. Wishing to keep this review spoiler-free, I will not reveal too much about it, except the general concept which you can still avoid it, if you want. The general backstory is about a race of tainted creatures, the Darkspawn, that occasionally awaken one of the dragon gods and corrupt him to their benefit. Then they proceed to invade the land, Ferelden, in an event known as the Blight. You have to stop them. The country of Ferelden has huge amounts of backstory elements about religion, wars, kings, races and more. You will not be bored finding out every bit and piece of information you come across. Despite its vastness however, plot tends to become repetitive at times. Even though every region and city has unique events and quests for you to fulfill, they tend to circle around the same principles: murder, assassination, betrayal. The results of your actions may indeed vary and have different consequences in the world, not every city should need a hero to rally everyone behind him and settle their differences like cities full of children.Your character's race and class will also allow you to choose one of the several starting stories you have. You can start as a noble, a common citizen, a member of the mage's circle or a member of a nomadic tribe. This creates a link between the player and your character, giving you a motive to drive the story forward. You might return to the lands you hailed from and everyone will remember you, or, depending on your standings, people you meet will react to you differently, either by addressing you ""my lord"" or with total racism. Your party members can be recruited from around the world (Le Daft Punk reference) and they can be kicked out anytime you want. They will also present you with side quests that involve them, like finding Sten's lost sword or helping the difficult relationship between Morrigan and her mother. Their skills can be customised and you can even select a second class for them if you want. Choosing the right members and getting to know them is key, since they have different personalities, backstories and opinions. That means your actions, like destroying a demon or making a pact with him, has corresponding results to the way your companions view you. If you do many things they consider them preposterous, they might even turn on you and try to murder you. This gameplay element is simply exquisite and so well made, I don't recall encountering anything similar, ever.Combat has several approaches you can take: you can fight in real time, by pausing and issuing orders or assign tactics that will determine the battle style of your companions. A combination of those means your party will be able to crush with ease the small groups of enemies you will encounter, forcing RPG veterans to buff the difficulty to Hard or Nightmare level. Micromanagement is key during battles, which adds to the tactical feel of the game. It tends to become repetitive quickly, however, especially since there's a limited number of tactics slots. Not only that, but sometimes, your companions tend to ignore their tactics or the commands you give them, resorting instead to use basic attacks instead of abilities and skills. Plus, their somewhat slow-minded AI makes them step on traps they could clearly see and disarm or avoid. Sooner or later, you will want direct control of everyone, after realising your mates can't do anything properly on their own.In the end, you can't help but enjoy this game, regardless of its flaws. You will have a good laugh as your companions jest and annoy each other, revealing this game's deep and complex character development and relationships, all set in a fractured world where civil war and mass extinction are threatening everyone.And remember to keep Sten away from cookies, and Morrigan with Alistair apart. Or not. Your choice.RATING:Gameplay: 8/10Presentation: 9/10Story: 9/10Unique Factor: Character Development: 9.5/10OVERALL: 8.8/10 ",121,15,0,28,18,0,21

												WARNING VERY LONGI suppose I should write a review, since Inquisition's story has finally ended, now begins my watch, for the next Dragon Age game.INTRODUCTIONDragon Age Origins was first released by in 2009 and was met with great acclaim, for its fantastic world design, setting, story, basically it was one the best RPG games of the decade, i say ""one of"" and not ""the"" mind you. Being released between both fallout 3 and new vegas, Dragon age had some considerable competition. Luckily it hold its own and more, with great storytelling, characters and some great gameplay.It definitely was not the prettiest game at the time, I mean the character looks can be anywhere from pretty and handsome in rare cases almost exclusive to companions, to plain old ugly appearances. There isn't much variety in customization, armours are simple recolours for the most part, weapons and bows too. Honestly the looks are definitely one of the worst parts of the game, just too little uniqueness in armour and weapons to make you and you party stand out from any other ordinary grunt, unless of course you enjoy that sort of thing.STORYI’ll try not to spoil too much, as many choices affect not situations and the ending in this game but also in the sequels too.You will have an origin story, by choosing your race and birthplace, either being, human, elf or dwarf, and being birthed in the slums, nobility or mage. Oh and the singled out dalish elf. Each of these will affect some dialogue options and give racial traits, it can also make some things easier or harder depending on the quest at hand. With these picked you will take part in a battle as a soldier in the Grey Wardens, an ancient order of protectors whose sole purpose is to defend life against the darkspawn and blights.After the being defeated at the battle you find out you're one of the last surviving members of the order, and is up to you to gather allies for a new army for one last battle, or the spawn will overtake all of thedas. Thus begins the main quest, along the way you will help out random strangers, groups of mages and mercs, decide the fate of magical order and dalish clan, find a lost piece of ancient dwarven history and find the remains of the bride to the Maker, the creator of life in the known world.So this is a huge story with many quests and side jobs, they can be incredibly drawn out each main segments easily takes out a hour or more depending on difficulty. But you use this time to stockpile potions and arrows, find the best weapons and armour for each of your 9 companions, all find additional support for your army. All of it eventually paying off in the epic finale at the end of the game were it all comes into play. This is one of the main reasons why this game is so great still stands today, as a great piece of storytelling.GAMEPLAYThe game play likes a old fashioned RPG, where you will control a party of characters assign specialties and classed, equip them as well. So it mostly strategy based combat, assigning orders, positioning, setting priorities and tactics and more. Alongside this combat is alose magic and consumables which also affect your allies if they are caught in in it area of effect making for carefully planned attacks. Through your character's skills, you can buff and debuff units, effectively controlling the battlefield. It is very difficulty explaining it completely, but such examples can very easily be found online, or if you have played it's much like Baldur's Gate.DIFFICULTYThis is another main great point of the game, it is naturally hard, even on the easiest difficulty. The game will often throw a number of enemies at you either being a small horde of easily dispatchable grunts, to a mini boss or two, as well as mix of troops. Magic is also your worst enemy as if left unchecked a mage will destroy your team single handley.As for the difficulty settings, it changes it artificially, increasing unit health, damage and defence, as well affecting certain other stats.  But despite all of this, even on easy there is plenty of leeway in how you can build your characters, but as you go up you will have to plan your builds accordingly or suffer a painful, live die and repeat scenarios.COMPANIONSI feel like I should bring these in as if you get into the game, you become invested in their story, to the point like many other people, you consider them Friends/Family for you Warden. Here's two examples of my favourite ones. Leliana, she's an assassin  Bard turned religious sister. She's confident but sweet, very calm and has an interesting backstory and quest to boot as well has her own origin DLC story, where you can gain a an amazing set of armour for you or her.My second is a dwarf warrior exilce called ohgren, hes allways drunk and allways randy, constantly trying to get it on with your female compainons or you, and trys and excuse to talk about the dirty stuff.There 8 of them in total, 3 Warriors, 2 rogues and 2 mages and a dog, there is also a unique dlc companion who is a stone golem, and is very interesting one at that. Also depending on your game choices you can get another warrior to join your party at the expense of another.  These characters are lovable and hateable in their own ways, each can be customized and leveled individually, each have their own speciality for combat. Through combat they can sustain injuries and if not treated or treated, will lead to their eventual death. Doing they don't like too much, or do something that goes completely against them, will make either leave or attack you.They all have extensive dialogue and backstory each will have their own personal quests that will give them bonuses or special weapons and/or armour. If you take an interest in them and start improving their approval of you, they will get bonus their base skills like constitution furthering a specialty.CONCLUSION Okay the graphics aren't great, the environments are vast and empty ,customization is limited, overall game is difficult and has many unpatched bug that can break quests. But this is a tiny proportion to what you’re getting, a huge world of fantasy, filled with a few hours worth history reading, rememberable characters, epic story and potentially almost a hundred hours worth of fun. There are many little thing I haven't mentioned yet, like how there is a modding community, DLC’s offer post game content, that will give rewards for your next playthrough, how actions caused here will affect many details of the next game, and the actions of the sequel will affect the sequel-sequel.This is definitely worth a look at the very least, or even just a read of the timeline or sotries embedded within the game.

												Compelling, epic story. Great graphics (starting to look dated in '14 but still beautiful). Rich characters. Masterfully crafted ending. Solid gameplay. This game's got it all, and I insist that you give it a chance if you haven't already. I've beaten this game more times than I care to admit on Origin and bought it here on steam just so I could uninstall Origin.The only downside to this game, and yes there is one - is that once you finish it, you'll be left excited and drooling for its sequel... but we all know how that turned out. You'll be left with a craving which you will never be able to fill.			",324,46,10,47,44,0,55

												After nearly 600 hours of this game, I can say that Dragon Age: Origins is one of the best games I've ever played. It may not be as flashy or next-gen as the third installment of the series, but it doesn't matter! Great, simple story, well-witten characters and quests, and everything feels to be in its own place. Also this is one of the most difficult games I've played.Oh so many times the game has made me rage-quit. In the character creation.Thank you, Bioware.			",26,12,0,13,2,0,1

												Dragon Age: Origins is a fantasy R.P.G. developed by Bioware and published by Electronic Arts. You are a Grey Warden, one of the last of this legendary order of guardians. With the return of mankind's ancient foe and the kingdom engulfed in civil war, you have been chosen by fate to unite the shattered lands and slay the archdemon once and for all. Explore a stunning world, make complex moral choices and engage in bone-crushing combat against massive and terrifying creatures. This title is yet another masterpiece from the fine people at Bioware. If you love roleplaying, fantasy or story-driven plot thick games then you will simply adore this title. From the beginning of Dragon Age: Origins to the very end, the adventure that your Grey Warden embarks upon will keep you enthralled as you follow the path of destiny in this wonderfully crafted land of R.P.G. goodness. The story, characters and lore all come together here in perfect increments to create a truly fantastic gaming experience that no fan of this genre should pass up.Besides the epic story, Origins gameplay/combat is the next big feather in this titles award winning hat. You have the option to engage in combat in either a third person view or the more popular and fun overhead tactical view which, in my opinion, is the best way to truly enjoy the game. One can choose to set parameters for battling and let the A.I. handle combat as you watch from the sidelines or you can opt to have complete control over the action and dictate every move that your party makes as well as what weapon, spell or potion that they use. The game implements a combat pause system that allows you to immediately stop the action and examine the battlefield to determine what commands to issue to your party members. Dragon Age: Origins definitely has some of the best tactical combat that you can find and it is just such a joy to play. I can still remember having my warrior unleash ""Warcry"" at the beginning of a battle quickly sending out a wave of force and knocking every enemy around me onto their collective bottoms pardon my french....ah good times. The best roleplaying games always give you many ways to customize your characters and Origins does a fantastic job of handling this requisite as well. Besides having the option to choose your race, gender and other physical features, there are also a variety of character classes to pick from and each of those can branch off into different subclasses or specializations futher improving the character customization. Also as in any typical R.P.G., as one gains experience points and level up you will be able to spend them on a number of abilities to enhance your parties combat prowess as well as their interactions with N.P.C.'s during dialogue as the story progresses.Graphically, I really like the look of Dragon Age: Origins. In my opinion, it does an absolutely wonderful job of truly capturing the ""Sword and Sorcery"" theme. Elves, dragons, magic, a love story, epic battles...this title manages to hit every bulletpoint that a great fantasy game requires. As the story unfolds, your party will trudge through murky swamps, dense forests, immense dungeons, towering cityscapes and beyond during your questing. The many locations that you visit are also quite diversified and have a unique look of their own from the dwarven thaig of Orzammar to the majestic towers of Denerim. The character models used in the cutscenes, be they human or non-human still look great to this day although some of the animations can seem a bit stiff at times. The sound quality is also exceptional and the game features a very memorable soundtrack as well.This title and it's expansion packs are well worth the money spent as it definitely is not a game that you are going to pick up and finish in just 10 hours...be prepared to spend many days or weeks in Ferelden depending on your particular style of play. The excellent main storyline will keep you intrigued from start to finish as you also find time to take on a number of nicely written sidequests and other various objectives. There is also an abundance of lore in Dragon Age: Origins in the form of books, scrolls and stories that you will hear from N.P.C.'s so if you're the type of gamer who enjoys this then be ready to spend plenty of time just reading as you game. Also, once you've finally finished the title for the first time I recommend that you start your second playthrough with some excellent modifications from the Nexus. Once again the wonderful modding community continues to prolong the replayability of yet another classic title...hooray! To summarize, I can honestly say without hesitation that Dragon Age: Origins is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for roleplaying gamers and players who just love a strong narrative in their titles. Your R.P.G. library is vastly incomplete without this spectacular addition from Bioware.			",200,61,3,37,12,0,13

												It's a good RPG with a very rich story and some interesting locations, but there's also a good amount of things that aren't that great.The presentation is flawless. The locations have a nice amount of detail and all feel unique. The music is great and the voice acting ranges from solid to excellent.The story will drag you in and give you many choices. There is a lot of flavour text to read and you can easily spend a couple of hours just wading through optional dialogue. There are also weaker quests and predictable subplots, but overall the story is good.Now to the not so good things: The combat system isn't bad, but you'll struggle with it quite often due to it being kind of delayed. Which in harder fights were every second counts can be very annoying. The game isn't overly hard, but there are fights that will really drain your patience because they aren't exactly well balanced.Next problem is the design of especially the later dungeons in the game. They are just stretched out way too much and filled with pointless time and resource consuming fights. In combination with the subpar combat system it's tedious to push through them.Lastly I have to say that the setting couldn't be more generic. There's nothing in this game that you haven't seen before (maybe except for some demons), but overall it feels like the team had a lot of ideas about the story, but none about the background. This is just a minor complaint though.I recommend the game, but mainly if you enjoy the story in a game more than actual gameplay.Edit: I just finished the expansion (The Awakening) and found it important to add a few lines about it as well. One complain about the main game was that it wasn't original enough in terms of setting and I have to say that this expansion really does a good job at correcting that mistake. It's nowhere as obvious what's going on as in the main game and there are unique non-human villains this time. Also due to the shorter nature of the expansion the dungeons don't drag as much as in the main game. I really enjoyed the expansion and would even go as far as saying that it's slightly better than the main game. This is more about the overall gameplay and not about the story. If you want to play the game you should really get the ultimate edition to get the full experience.			",3271,1346,120,379,425,37,487

												It happens that after a few hours of navigation between a beautiful forest and a dark dungeon, dozens of meetings and a number of stories related to these places enormous evocative power ultimately, to arrive by the group of werewolves that so much has been done to kill them, to know the personification of the forest that takes care of them in some way, educates them to check their bestial instincts. It happens that suddenly all consciousnesses disappear and can no longer tell whether those who had sent him to accomplish that mission is good or bad, because the cause and the solution of the problem and line up more than you all right, all fall in some wrong. The dragons of the good times andatiDragon Age: Origins is so, what has been billed as the spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate is an enormous adventure, a prism that allows you to enter one of the many facets that make it up out of it every time in a thousand different facets, wearing the clothes of characters called to a heroic end but imprisoned in a world that has lost the moral alignment usually BioWare titles in favor of a complex of interpersonal relationships is amazing how vivid, able to tell at best the many dramas and the few joys offered by a world on the brink of destruction, but still dominated by self-interest, greed and then by the tragedies of each individual. Long, fulfilling, deep and playable in at least two completely different ways, Dragon Age: Origins is the pinnacle of a certain way of playing role, very classic and maybe not perfect, but certainly wonderful and fulfilling.

												This game is just so amazing. It's perhaps my favourite game of all time! I love all of the Dragon Age games, but Origins has a special place in my heart! If you don't play this, you're seriously missing out! It's so replayable too, I've completed the main story 3 times! I first played it on my Xbox 360 so all of the hours I've spent aren't tracked on my steam account, but each playthrough lasts a good 60 hours, and there are so many choices in the game and the lore is so amazing and the characters are so round and beautiful and perfect...

												Dragon Age: Origins is the best game I've ever played in terms of role-playing. The Origin story system allows you to create characters that feel unique every time, and make every playthrough completely different. The interactions between your character and your companions are incredibly complex and engaging, and allow you to really develop your character's personality. The storyline is very long yet entertaining, and gives you many options as to how to proceed through and eventually complete the game. Often times, there is no right decision, and your actions will have far reaching consequences, and will also affect your companions' opinion of you.As for the gameplay, it is different to many RPGs in that it is very strategy based, and when playing on Normal or harder, you will have to actively manage all four members of your party in order to succeed. The combat can be very punishing and is perhaps too difficult, especially early in the game. Warriors, the front line of your party, will die very quickly without high stats and equipment. However, if you use your party's abilities well, and make good decisions as to which abilities you unlock, you should be alright. The game is open world, though to travel between areas, you must watch your progress on a map. The textures of the NPCs are good enough that they don't affect immersion, yet many of the textures of the environment are rather low-res. However, the game is pretty old now so that is only to be expected. I did not find that it took away from my role-playing experience. The voice-acting is superb, and while like most games you get used to the same voice actors, each NPC does seem slightly different.Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone, and putting in the hours to beat the storyline is extremely rewarding. The various expansions provide a significant late game, or you could just make a totally new character! Even after two playthroughs, the game says I have only completed 54% of the content. Buy this game!			",32,5,0,16,9,0,11

												Literally the best game series i've ever played. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for:1. A great story - This game offers one of the greatest storylines I've ever played. It will make you feel emotions you never thought existed. I laughed, cried, gotten frustrated, been happy, been sad, and everything else in between and I have no regrets.2. Replayability - One of the best things about this game, in my opinion, is the replayability effect. This is one of the only games i've ever played where you can play it over and over and over again and still be able to find new things in each and every playthrough. You can't just play this game once and expect to learn all of its secrets. It never gets boring.3. Crossover Choices - What I mean is, when you make choices, these choices will ultimately effect the next game you play. Your choices effect and shape the way your story will turn out and the way characters act and react in the next game. Choose to be moral and have integrety and you will be remembered that way. Choose to be that guy who screws everything up and your followers will have something to say about that. Awesome, right?There is so much more about this game that I haven't even metioned here because I want you to go and figure out all the awesome-ness this game has to offer. So what are you waiting for? Stop reading this and go play this game! This game is still worth $60 in my opinion so you are getting an amazing deal here! Have fun!			",88,16,0,12,7,0,4

												I cannot believe I allowed myself to overlook Dragon Age: Origins for so long! I love a game that places a lot of the power in the player’s hands. From creating a character that looks the way you want, to dialogue and action choices that shape the way the world in the game perceives you and evolves; the choices are yours. This makes the game a lot more engaging and the characters more intimate.Dragon Age: Origins is a sensational role-playing video game developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts.Read the full review![geekatheartily.tumblr.com] ",97,37,0,14,6,2,7

												Let me say that I avoided this game for years, Inquisition is better I thought, look at Origins, it's ugly and the animations are dull. What a stupid mistake on my account! Dragon Age: Origins is a masterpiece of a game, a fantastic world, amazing characters and dialogue and a story in which I felt involved personally. In Origins you're not exploring the world as a character, this character is an extension of you, it's you. This game has a soul and I guarantee that if you have played the sequels without playing this one and you think they're better, trust me you'll rearrange their places quickly. I recommend this game as it's one of the best RPGs I've played.			",43,6,0,10,2,0,1

												I LOVE this game. It is easily the best $30 I have ever spent. The characters are memorable, the story line is engaging and the atmosephere is spot on. I have played the game through on multiple occasions on multiple difficulty settings and I can honestly say that I hated going through the Deep Roads every time. I will admit, some of the DLC's are overpowered. Some of the gear you can get make the game laughable but still rewarding. Most of the gear cannot be obtained without compelting different achivements in Lilliana's Song, Darkspawn Chronicles and Golems Amgarrak. All of these give you different rewards for being a completionist. The majority of the dlc released (those listed above) including Witch Hunt are different campagines that do not effect the main story. I'm going to stop here, because if I don't i'm going to end up spoiling the game and you would be reading an eight page article and not a review. Here's my advice, buy the Ultimate Edition if you can, it's $10 more than the base game and you will get EVERYTHING. Each DLC adds 5-20 hours of addition game play to an already 100+ hour game. Currently I have logged 313 hours onto this game and I find myself coninueing to enjoy it.			",93,3,0,11,9,0,21

												I've played a lot of D&D Roleplaying style games over the years, beginning with Pools of Radiance in 1988, and Dragon Age is the first game I've completed in its' entirety. I enjoyed the storyline, and also enjoyed the DLC. I completely nearly every side quest, and while exploring every nook-and-cranny I found that I did not experience a single system or software crash during 152 hours of gameplay. I highly recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I purchased this game being a big Bioware fan and to get ready for dragon age inquisition and all I have to say is that I never wanted it to end. It is a great game with fantastic characters (well the party members and maybe a few others), great choices, and a great world to explore. After compleating the main quest as a Dwarf and then going through all the dlc as the same character I really did not want it to end. It was very sad to finish the final dlc and end his journey. Hmm maybe I should be evil... and an elf... evil elf... yeah that sounds good.			",180,87,1,43,17,3,27

												I originally owned this on a console, so really my time with this game is close to 1000 hours I would think. After all that time, I have 3 conclusions:1. Mages are OP, whether as NPCs, teammates, or your own character (probably most so as your own character)...but isn't that what magic is supposed to be?2. Swooping is bad.3. This is one of the best RPGs of all time. The writing, characters, gameplay, pacing, customization...everything, is just top notch. This is BioWare at its finest. Plus, after all this time and so many playthroughs, I still get surprised by funny banter between party members I had previously never really paired up before, such as this gem from my last playthru:     Shale: So here is a question for the painted elf...    Zevran: Painted elf? Oh, that's me! I do like that.    Shale: Am I to understand correctly that the painted elf is a ""crow""?    Zevran: Not literally, but... yes. I am a Crow.    Shale: As in a bird.    Zevran: Is there another sort?    Shale: So the painted elf assaults helpless statuary with its feces?    Zevran: If given sufficient cause, why not?    Shale: That is outrageous! The painted elf will stay away from me. Or else.    Zevran: (Sighs) I get a lot of that. +Epic story with rich lore.+Awesome characters all around.+Multiple origins and endings keep things interesting with a new playthrough.+So much replayability+Requires actual strategy to your team building to not get massacred at key points.+Unlike so many other RPGs today, you actually do start to feel stronger and more heroic as the game progresses, but it still stays challenging. +Awakening expansion is nearly as good as the main game-General BioWare RPG gripe: it's always pretty lame how you so easily get wrapped up into awkward, immersion breaking conversations because of how the romance system works. Namely, unless you're mean to--or outright ignore--a romanceable party member, they're going to fall in love with you.-Minor gripe: wish there was a sell junk button in the PC version (but I'm sure there is a mod for that).-No griffons.Even if the combat style is not quite your thing, you would be remiss to skip such an expertly-crafted game.

												This is without a doubt one of the best RPGs ever made. in a sense it's the perfect RPG. tons of choices, deep character creation, different playstyles, an amazing plot, great characters, and more. i have put about 300 or more hours into this game, since I got it on console way before PC and poured tons of hours into my console version. This game has a unique and great plot that will immerse you in a fantasy world unlike any other, with a combat system that is tactical and fun, and characters that you will become emotionally attached to. it has a great soundtrack, the main menu song is incredible and there are some scenes where characters will sing to you and the voices are beautiful. the graphics aren't anything special but there are mods that can make the graphics better. However this game is not about graphics, even with all the cool new games coming out with their high definition graphics i still come back and play this game, and still believe it to be one of the best. it has plenty of exploration and side quests, lots of loot, and nice armors and weapons. the classes are all varied and offer unique combat styles and are all very fun. this is just my personal opinion but this is the best out of the 3 Dragon Age games, none of the others quite capture the true nature of an RPG like this one does. The main story is great as well, with multiple endings and romance options that are all very fulfilling. Overall this game is very well rounded and there aren't many ways it could be improved. there are very few bugs and the game runs great. all in all if you want an amazing RPG to pour hundreds of hours into then this is definitely the game for you, i cannot reccomend this game more highly. I have hundreds of hours of playtime and i still discover somthing new every time i play it which is incredible. The DLC are all pretty good as well, some are better than others but none of them are bad. Bioware has a long history of amazing RPGs and this is one of them.

Posted: December 11, 2014
												It’s not easy always being at the cutting edge, and that’s why I’ve decided to review this Dragon Age game, and not the new one which people are currently interested in.DA:O is a few years old now, but it has taken a few attempts for me to actually stick with it, and it with me. Hence, tardy review. But, let me be clear, right off the bat. It’s as good as everybody said it was, all those years ago! Sure, it has a somewhat off-putting generic fantasy shell, and the designers needn’t have limited themselves to just four colours (brown, grey, green, and reddish-brown) when they were painting this grand adventure. You might say it’s more realistic but sod realism, this is a fantasy game, and it’s all a bit too “trad”, at least at first blush.However, I can only speak personally. There are many people who adore trad fantasy and all its trappings, and who don’t like change. More power to them, but for me, at first glance, there doesn’t seem to a lot of originality here, in setting or theme. I persisted, peeled back those crusty brownish-grey outer layers, and found something truly engrossing. This game has a lot of humour, and a lot of heart.When it was first released, there was a lot of buzz about DA:O being a spiritual successor to the Baldur’s Gate games, which meant there would be swords, dragons, magic, derring-do and loads of fighting. This is all true of DA:O. There was also a lot of hype for the “Origins” system, proudly displayed in the title, which meant that instead of having one single starting sequence (location, npcs, events) you’d have a different one based on your race and class. You might find yourself a poor elf in an alienage, forced to get by on your wits and the point of a knife, or a stalwart dwarven noble in a monumental underground palace, and all the intrigue that entails. Where you come from also affects how you’ll be perceived by party members and other important characters in the game. It was supposed to make you feel more of a connection to your character, and I think it really works and actually helps give the game a decent amount of replayability. From my own experience the balance of the game is probably weighted about 60/40 in favour of combat over conversation, which is okay. It’s not great: there have been times when I’ve been exploring a temple or an underground cavern and become completely fatigued with having to fight the same enemies again and again, with the only difference being that this time it’s archers instead of mages standing at the back. It hasn’t happened often, though, and because the game is relatively free-form, you can always go and do something else. If you’re the type of player that prefers diplomacy over fistcuffery, beware: more often than not, quests end in big fights.Combat takes place in real-time, but you can pause the game to issue commands, and watch them play out when you unpause. There are tons of spells and skills, so you’ll want to make sure to use the right ones at the right times. I’d say that on any difficulty above Easy, you will need to pause quite regularly and be prepared to micro-manage to some degree. The other option is setting up tactics for each party member, which are like little scripts for them to follow. You might set up your tank to immediately engage the strongest enemy, or tell your mage to cast an AoE if enemies are standing near to each other. This takes time to organise, and tactics which work for one fight may not do so well in another, but generally this feature will reduce busywork and it can be satisfying to spectate as your team dismantles the enemy without you lifting a finger.Fights can get quite busy. You will almost always be assaulted by many foes, some up close and some at range, and there will be bursts of fire and magic bolts flying. It can be hard to keep track, so it’s a good thing the devs included a tactical camera. You can flick the mousewheel to pull the camera back into the ceiling, just far enough that you can see who is who and where people are positioned. It’s pretty useful, and entirely missing from the console versions. Pat yourself on the back for owning a PC.I mentioned before that I’ve bounced off this game, and this has been because of difficulty spikes. Depending on in which order you choose to approach the three (or four, I forget) “main” quests in the game, you may find yourself running up against enemies which are too tough for you, or battles which seem to go on forever, where enemy waves continuously spawn. Case in point, Redcliffe, which Alistair, a party member, specifically advises you to tackle first of all. This questline is good fun, but very combat heavy and has a one particular fight where waves of enemies just keep on spawning, so you need to keep party members safe all the way through the fight. From a storytelling point of view it makes sense: Alistair cares for the Arl of Redcliffe, and can’t have known about the danger before telling you to go there. But as a player, it’s a harsh lesson to learn at an early point in the game. As I said, don’t be afraid to go and do something else if you keep getting hammered. Will wrap up with the most positive points. The writing is frequently excellent, particularly with regards to the banter between party members. The lore is deep, and the in-game codex completely overflows with interesting entries to read about the history of the land, the people and the places. It looks good! Faces are a bit “uncanny valley” at times, but mostly well animated and  believable. If you’re in the market for a deep and fairly complex RPG to sink your teeth into, then get Dragon Age: Inquisition. But, if you’re poor like me, get this one.			",264,77,3,30,17,2,22

												So in 2009, Bioware decided to return to its roots of making RPGs in the vein of Baldur's Gate with Dragon Age: Origins. What resulted is a very engaging and thrilling tale of a band of misfits that come together to defeat the evil Darkspawn and their leader, the Archdemon. I wholeheartedly can recommend it.The story of Dragon Age is a pretty good one, with a good mix of political intrigue and dark fantasy themes. There is some really expansive lore in this game available for you to read in the codex, which would take you hours to read. I assure you, however, that reading all of it is worth it.The party members are all unique characters, and well-written. Some would say a few are weaker than others as far as being interesting (looking at you, Sten), but they all have decent backstories and are really fun to hear banter between each other. That's another thing; the party banter is hilarious and worth stopping to listen to.The combat in this game is beyond thrilling. You can pause combat at any time to issue orders to your four-member party, and after unpausing they will act out the order. You can play the game either in third-person or an isometric view. I prefer the isometric for tactical reasons and for that classic Baldur's Gate/Planescape feel. You can also set up tactics for your party members so that they will use certain items/abilities when a condition is met. This can get as in-depth as you like, and its one of the coolest features of the game in my humble opinion.Graphically, the game doesn't look too bad for how old it is already, but there are texture mods to spice it up, if you're interested. Be aware, however, that this could cause stuterring due to the game engine not really liking textures being TOO large. Otherwise, the graphics are servicable, but nothing to write home about. I don't really care about them, but its up to you to decide whether or not they bother you.tl;dr Dragon Age: Origins is a return to form for Bioware RPGs and a great 100-or-so-hour romp for RPG nerds like myself. Buy it if you want to experience one of the better games to come out in recent years. Its worth it. Good story, good characters, great game.			",164,20,2,32,8,0,20

												An absolute gem. Masterpiece of the Dragon Age series (haven't played Inquisition yet), tons of replayability, memorable characters and amazing storyline, infinite routes to go in terms of character development. For me this game easily qualifies to be one of the best RPGs of all time, a fantastic example of what Bioware can pull off with enough time and resources.The combat is satisfying and challenging at the same time, it will appeal to the tacticians as well as the people who aren't well versed in that sort of combat system. You can make amazing combinations with your character's attacks and the game rewards you for being intelligent. One example is if you freeze an enemy then use a crushing attack, the enemy will instantly die by being shattered, giving you an effective combo when you come upon a tough segment. There's a lot of combinations like this, and I encourage you to find them all for yourself.If you want to experience Bioware at their greatest, pick this up, with all the downloadable content. You'll sink so many hours into this game that's it not funny (ignore the time I have on Steam, used to have this on Origin and now I Family Share it with my brother-in-law, I have easily over 100+ hours on this game).

												   Dragon Age: Origins is an oldie but goodie. It has quite the replay value - the game changes somewhat depending on the particular character origins; the character choices throughout the game impact its progression as well. The story itself is interesting - its dark tone doesn't get overwhelming thanks to occasional comic relief (sometimes unintentionally in the form of the enemies).     The game's strongest draw, however, are the well-written and expertly voiced companions - their attitude towards the player depends on the particular interactions resulting in either animosity, friendship or romance. The background banter between companions can be quite hilarious.   On the downside, the combat can get repetitive for those who are not quite the strategic thinkers (like me), although I grew to love it. The character creation is rather lacking, however the problem can be easily (and with great success) solved with the use of mods. Tl;dr: Whether you want to fall in love with one of the charming companions or get mentally scarred for life by the hideous boob monster, you're in for a treat.			",151,58,6,23,12,0,10

												Such an amazing experience. Probably my favourite RPG of all time alongside Star Wars: KOTOR and The Sith Lords.+ Good main quest.+ The game is pretty hard on hard/nightmare settings and it will give you a challenge unlike many newer noob friendly RPG's with their ''press X to win/do something amazing"" gameplay.+ Amazing soundtrack.+ Likable companions with interesting side stories.+ The origin stories! A lot of replay value here for just seeing how the diffrent origin stories start out. Also every origin story offers some unique dialogue options later in the game.+ Some great DLC like The Awakening (20+ hours of gameplay).+ Very funny party banter ( Allistair vs Morrigan is my favourite... or when Wyne and Oghren talk about beer in the Deep Roads )Really can't think of one thing i dislike about this game. Played all three Dragon Age games and this is by far my favourite. DA2 i hated with a passion while DAI i found pretty good, but not Origins level good. Sad we don't see more games of this type, and that the few RPG series we even have are going for more of an action/open world type gameplay, and less focuss on interesting story and actual RPG elements.

												Pros:- Combat is not just hack 'n slash. It relies heavily on strategy and tactics.- Character development like no other game (of its time). Not just your own story, but your party members too. The level to which you can interact with them - and even them with each other - adds a whole 'nother dimension of entertainment to the game.- It's easy to switch your party members around. If you don't want to use someone, they don't 'go home' or leave forever. They just wait for you at camp.- Main plot line and side quests suck you right in.- Depending on the race you wish to play, there are different beginnings to the game. And depending on your choices throughout the game, you will have different outcomes, even a different ending. So there is plenty of replayability enjoyment!Cons:- I think I thought of one the other day, but it escapes me...All in all, one of the best RPGs I've played.			",6,14,2,5,6,0,3

												Dragon Age: Origins is a spectacular edition to the fantasy genre. It has a lovely story of good vs. evil, and graces you with a lovely story with each waking. The companions, while not plentiful, are memorable. Each  one of them has a distinct personality, and react to different situations differently. Bioware has their trademark beautiful talking cutscenes, and depending on your group, and standing with them, they will jump into conversations on various occasions. The six varying ways to start the game adds a lot of diversity, and replayability for that matter. It's gameplay can be compared to WoW if you are familiar with it. A skill bar at the bottom for abilities and items, though a twist comes in. You have a party of four to control, you and three companions, and you have the ability to control each and every one. You gain even more control with the ability to pause the combat, and issues orders to be done when you unpause it. If you don't like strategizing, and have a console, you could pick it up on the Xbox or playstation for a more combat oriented gameplay.TL;DR, Overall, this game is a must-buy for anyone who enjoys the fantasy, spell-casting, and shield-bashing genre that this game falls under. In my honest opinion, this game is a 10/10. Great characters, good gameplay, and good story.			",141,24,0,30,6,2,10

												Don't get me wrong this game is great. There's nothing else in the genre that can mess with it, no matter what anybody else tells about it.What is making me feel really, really angry and soooo sad about this Steam Release is, that it deleted my previous Dragon Age Origins save games,  and btw. also my Dragon Age 2 save games while it overwrote the MyDocuments\Bioware folder without any prompting. And of course ... I've got no backup.In memory of the deleted Grey Wardens: Rosi, Heidi, Chaos, Arnold, Hulda, Reimundt, Violence, LemmyThe remaiming Hawk Family: Carolus, Jason, Marina, RosePS: Anyway - I'm not shure if it was my fault - that's why I would recommend it.

												A very good game, with a storyline that is INCREDIBLY versatile and can go a MILLION ways. Each choice you makes impacts the entire world, for a seriously immersive experience. The gameplay is a little tacky and can be frustrating at times, and a few sequences are a little more prolonged than really need be. But otherwise, an incredible game with MANY different directions, and a vast story to dive headfirst into, and many little pocket stories to explore, this game is an excellent purchase. I look forward to playing the next 2 in the Trilogy.			",4,1,0,2,0,0,4

												I bought this game quite awhile ago, but I never got into it (didn't really get far into it at all either), even as a HUGE fan of the Mass Effect series (Mass Effect 2 being my favorite game of all time). I have absolutely no clue as to why i didn't get into it so much earlier on. As my Semester just ended, I was extremely bored and i didn't really have anything else to play but this. And now,I finished Dragon Age Origins in less than 3 days completing as many quests as possible and I had one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. This game is truly a masterpiece, with extremely well-done story telling, awesome characters, good character development and a very RPG-feel combat system to go along with it. Ever since I finished this game a 2 weeks ago, I've since then finished Dragon Age 2, and I'm even almost done with Dragon Age Inquisiton. Although both these 2 games were also great, they don't compare to Dragon Age Origins when it comes to story telling. I'm glad I was able to play this game, as it has become one of my favorites ever. A True MUST-play for any RPG fans out there			",224,20,0,25,5,2,22

												Dragon Age was my first real experience with a computer game. I saw someone else playing it and wanted to give it a go. I ended up buying a PS3 and the game on console and played it through from start to finish twice (that's over 200 hours of playtime right there). Starting an Origins game is a bit of commitment, often I lose track of what I was planning for a character if I stop playing them for a while, so I start over. Rinse and repeat.At the time I can genuinely say that this game changed my life. How it holds up now is a bit harder to say for sure. I find the combat slow (which was great when I had never played a combat game before) and in fact the whole game is a bit on the slow side by today's standards, but if you can get past older graphics and a slow pace, I recommend giving it a go. Especially, when you can buy the whole lot on sale for so little.It has romance, humour, friendship, betrayal and so much more. The lore of the Dragon Age universe is deep and there is plenty to read if you're interested in a world with a lot of depth. The main story arc remains the same no matter what you do - for the most part - but you can surely mess with a lot of people's lives along the way, including your own followers. Will they find happiness? Love? A horrible death? Sometimes they will even break your heart.Also, there are 6 totally different starts to the game depending largely on race and class. If you find starting the game as a human noble a bit boring, try being a circle mage or a dwarven commoner or dwarven royalty or a city elf or a dalish elf. Each start is different. You will find yourself in a different location with a different tragedy establishing who you are. A few hours in all the stories converge to the main story arc, but you will never forget where you came from and where it placed you in the world. No amount of ""this is your backstory"" can have the impact of experiencing it. Even better is that you can import your save game into DA2 or use the Dragon Age Keep to recreate (or rewrite) your story for Inquisition and the choices you made will change both of those games in many small ways! You can have a continuous history over all three games. It's a beautiful thing.As for the content packs, some have more in them than others. One of my favourites is The Darkspawn Chronicles. Have you ever wondered how the final battle of a game would go if you were playing as the enemy? It was awful, having to defeat my own beloved companions in the final battle, but also really interesting. There were cutscenes and all. I may have even cried a little.Awakenings starts to move more into the style of Dragon Age 2 and introduces a very important character or two. It's a fairly substantial bit of extra content, maybe 20 hours from memory?All the way back then, I would have given the game 9.9 out of 10, now... it's still a great game if you can get into it, a classic even, but it's dated. Of course it is.If you have never tried a combat game before, but want to start playing combat games? You couldn't get a much easier introduction as you can pause combat (in all the DA games) and apply tactics - or just catch your breath. Difficulty can be ramped up if you want a challenge or right down if you want a cakewalk.Made me think, made me laugh, broke my heart, changed my life.On PC there are also plenty of modding options, Nexus mods has over 2000 files. I never really modded Origins due to playing it primarily on console, but I like the idea.			",46,20,0,13,9,0,1

 RATING: 9.5/10 - Legendary Masterpiece of Gaming ===Alright, i felt i needed to get this review done after finishing this game again, this time on Steam, and all the DLCs. Like you probably guessed by the score i given to it, this game is near absolute perfection as far as role playing games are concerned.So, let's start the usual way...=== Pros & Cons  + Pros + + Absolutely great story, with tons of dialogue options, romance possibilities, all fully voice-acted and very well-written.+ A huge world full of quests, discoveries to make, enemies to defeat and secrets to reveal+ Great companions with in-depth backgrounds, personalities and alignments+ Deep character and class building system, with loads of skills to suit any playstyle+ Programmable party members behaivior in combat to suit your own commands+ Real-time pause combat system with fully controllable companions and even summons, you can take control of any ally at any time+ Tons upon tons of different enemies, weapon types, armors and general loot to find+ Maximum level difficulty is hard as hell but gives great satisfaction+ Still good graphics for a game this old+ Balanced combat which always gives the right amount of challenge but is never frustrating+ Your choices in the story will impact heavily on what happens - Cons - Game doesn't work well on Win 8/8.1/10 systems. Use XP SP3 compatibility mode and run as admin to fix.- Above average amount of crashes. This is due to a memory leak issue that BioWare never addressed, but can be fixed by setting graphics to medium/low (doesn't matter if you have a high-end pc or not, it's just bugged)- Some spells are a bit overpowered if used right- Melee rogue class is underpowered and can't really compete with other builds even in late game, making it pretty useless=== Final thoughts even if it has some problems mostly related to it being old and bugged in the core programming (see memory leak), this game is still an absolute jewel and in my opinion one of the greatest RPGs ever created in the history of gaming. I have played all the major titles you can possibly imagine, and even edgy ones, but compared to this they all are blown away, only other true masterpieces can hold against a game of this greatness.Just get it.

												Oh my god, how have I not yet written a review for this amazing Game?!Dragon Age manages to combine an Epic Story, a great tactical combat system and superb presentation almost perfectly in a single Game.I'll try to keep this somewhat short:Why is it good?  Player Freedom: You get to choose Gender, Race and Class for your Hero, each with a Unique Starting chapter and during the game, your choices MATTER. It will affect how people react to you, how a Quest ends etc. etc. The Combat System: It is a Party based Combat system that can be paused at any point, to give Commands to your party members. While that doesn't sound special - the way it is set up makes it Special. Not only are the different abilities interesting and add a lot of tactical depth, but these abilites can also interact with each other in 2 ways.1. Indirectly - for example your Mage freezes several opponents in Place, so another Party member can easily hit an AoE ability2. Directly in the form of Combos - For example combining different elemental spells to form the Thunder-Blizzard of the Century Engaging Story and Presentation: If there is one thing Bioware really knows how to do, it's how to create an interesting World/Lore and present it. The World really feels alive and coherent. There is so much material for the player to read into the Lore if he is interested and the presentation is just amazing. The cutscenes are well animated (as is pretty much anything considering when it came out), the voice acting is stellar across the board and the sound assets as well as the music itself is nothing to  sneeze at. Characters & Romances: A huge part of Bioware games such as Mass Effect, Dragon Age etc. is the ability for a Player to start a romantic relationship with a party member. To me personally, this is even better in Dragon Age: Origins, than it was in Mass Effect. The Characters in both games are of course very unique and likeable, but when it comes down to it, i'd choose Morrigan or Leliana over Tali or Liara any day of the week.Also characters that you cannot woo are amazingly well done overall. There will be some that you love, there will be some that you just wont ever really understand, and there are some that you will HATE. As it should be - and yet, if you put in the time you might figure out that a villain that you hated, actually had really good intentions.So overall they feel really well fleshed out, they feel like actual Persons with real emotions. Replayability: Due to the many different choices, origins and endings that you will experience throughout the game, it is very likely that you will have a second and third playthrough. (Hell I probably have like 20 different chararcters at this point). In addition to that, the game can be really challenging on higher difficulties - so maybe you want to try and beat it on the Legendary difficulty later on. Mods: While the modding community isn't very active anymore, it has been in the past and all their work is still available. Additional armors, better textures, new quests, Locations, characters, the ability to skip parts of the game (♥♥♥♥ the fade!),  nude- and ahem ""love""-mods. You name it!They add to the already huge amount of time that this game will take out of your life. But it was worth every minute if you ask me :) What's bad about it: Slow Combat: This is pretty much the only thing i can think of. The Animations in Combat might feel slow to some people. They kinda did to me at first and were made faster in Dragon Age II and Inquisition. It's probably best to quickly check it in a Youtube Video - see if it bothers you. It's by no means unplayably slow, but everything kinda feels like it should just be a tick faster. Achievements: Now i dont really know if this can be counted as a negative thing for most people, but i feel bad only mentioning the combat System. So the game does have achievements - however they are not supported by steam. If you decide to play it on Origin, they will show up and you can brag to your friends there, as i am sure we all have a huge amount of friends on Origin....This seems like i am really biased, but that is the games fault because it is just THAT good. There really aren't many bad aspects that stood out to me.Overall this is a game that I believe everybody should have experienced at least once. It is certainly better than it's sequels, and to me, it even blows the Mass Effect series out of the water.Sale or not - this game is definitely worth it's price			",193,42,7,42,23,2,15

												If you're willing to get past some of the antiquated designs (mainly combat and inventory), DA:O is one of the best RPGs you could ever play. You could spend hours just talking to your companions, who are written fantastically and really draw you into the game. The intense struggle of uniting Fereldan and its conflicted peoples against the Darkspawn is a one of a kind adventure. There can be some lulls in its pacing, which generally come after completing a major quest (I'm looking at you, Deep Roads), but if you can power through and continue with the game, you won't regret it one bit.

												Take a fantasy novel, double it's length, throw in BioWare, and add a little EA meddling to make yet another Bioware classic.There isn't a secret recipe for a good solid game. It's just a shame the pure ingredient called Bioware can't be found anymore. You always find it now tainted with EA.While you will find this title to be well crafted, it's not for everyone. I had to get over my hate for the  fantasy genre, which wasn't easy. I'm glad that I did, as I would have missed out on yet another  Bioware classic. If you prefer running n' gunning, don't dream of playing this unless you can change your attitude. Sadly, many of the newer generation of PC gamers fall into the “action packed” trap, where they miss out on what makes a game – it's story. Characters take revenge, scheme behind your back, among other things.Speaking of story, one of my teachers once told me that a good plot mixes together the right amounts of gore, sex, and humor. While you will find all three in Dragon Age: Origins, there isn't enough humor to lighten the load so to speak. You will find that the story simply drags on. I recommend playing in 1-3 hour sessions, otherwise you might just end up leaving such a great title in the dust. The “behind your back” conversations are a nice break as the maps can take a long time to explore.It took me about 65 hours to play though once, not even completing every single minor side quest. Mass Effect 3 took 24, and the others in the series about 12-24. The store page lists 80 hours of gameplay, which seems about right. Many won't be able to withstand that long on one game since it feels like it just drags on. At the end of the day, if you can bear with it, you won't be disappointed.The “Ultimate Edition” includes quite a few DLCs that I didn't end up using/playing. The original seems plenty long enough, but I don't think I will end up going back soon for “The Awakening” DLC. The game ends with a cliff hanger, which was obviously setup for the 2nd.The joke with Mass Effect is that you should get an achievement for not getting laid. While some of you understand that joke and it being true for Mass Effect, it's not the same here. Dragon Age uses a scale from -100 to 100 (or what seems to be -100). If a party member's gauge is to low, they will leave you! Mass Effect uses a simple 1-5 scale, where “loyalty” is at 4, romance is declared at a 5, and save porting uses a special 6. All of that is of course hidden, but in Dragon Age it isn't. This newer and what some would call better “romance mechanic” makes it hard to understand. This isn't a real life simulator, but does a much better job then the “getting laid simulator” in the Mass Effect series. You can follow and please one individual, but then end up displeasing others severely – even if they aren't in your current party. Throw in the invisible “hardening” mechanic as well.. You will have to read the wiki to understand how complex the whole game is.It's judgment time now. I think 91/100 is fair for the metascore, as long as you can overcome your hate for the fantasy genre (nudge nudge me), not enough “pew pew” (many young gamers) and understand or appreciate the mature subjects within the title.So all in all, even with bugs in character's movement, old 2009 graphics, and a story that just seems to drag on, I can't stamp a great or terrible score. Playing quite a few other titles, and understanding who you need to be to enjoy this, I give this super long review a number for the game.8.5/10			",160,24,1,13,24,0,25

												Instead of reviewing one game, it would be more useful to discuss the trilogy. I would recommend you get them from Origin—unfortunately, there is no franchise bundle—though you can transfer saves between clients. Dragon Age shows BioWare's creativity by redefining the CRPG experience of storytelling as well as role-playing design. Each game provides subversions in fantasy, and even in BioWare games, that shows their best quality. Unlike Mass Effect, this trilogy has little direct relations, choosing instead to expand upon the lore. In many ways, DA uses aspects of past series (ex. Baldur's Gate, even SoD) to focus on the strengths of each game. The result, as often seen by fans, is a series divided by various camps thinking one game defines the franchise.  The truth is what defines DA is more a collection of shared interests: A title granted to a hero, and a story of world-building and of companions. Each game should be evaluated as its own take, which means if one game doesn't interest you the others may be more favorable.  Dragon Age: Origins	DA:O is often considered the best DA game. Looking back on Origins, it's hard to imagine that DA would be BioWare's most innovative series. DA:O is mainly derivative of their previous games of BG and Neverwinter Nights. You just have to look far beneath the surface for their differences.Though the lore is free from the D&D influence, choosing a Judeo-Christian-like fantasy religion, the mechanical complexity of DA:O is reminiscent of CRPGs. It's more streamlined and story/companion driven than their older games, but if you raise the difficulty it provides just as much challenge. It helps keeps a steady pace.As someone who was put off by BG's beginning, I relished returning to DA:O where companions only die in plot-related moments. The AI in BioWare's games have always been finicky, so the lack of punishment for random behavior is easier to tolerate. However, the difficulty can sometimes feel cheapened—especially in DLCs—if you don't maximize every tactical element, even on Normal.Gameplay, however, isn't DA:O's strongest aspect. The combat scaling can feel random, coupled by the slow pace of attacks and the limited variety of enemies. Like other CRPGs there is a lot of pausing to micromanage required to win. However, the combat is not what people come to replay but its narrative design.DA:O uses a modular design where there are multiple paths for each required section of the plot, but how you choose to resolve them and how they affect the future events is what is important. Some chapters have higher skill requirements, but your paths stay as player-driven as the city in BG2. The influence of past events, your character's identity and origin, and companion responses offer replayability. It all almost works.The origins of DA:O is where it struggles. The weakest introduction is probably the Dalish elves, which is odd because they have the most lore. The Human noble, City Elves and Dwarf stories are simple revenge/justice hooks. Only the Mage stands out as the most unique. Whatever your choice, it becomes irrelevant after the intro as the world takes the stage. Personal affiliation with the protagonist, as a result, becomes the weakest part of DA:O.  Dragon Age 2This flaw feels like the main source of refinement for DA2, and it's why I enjoy this game the most out of the series. The story of the Champion and of the personal narratives of Hawke's family and companions feels the most tightly written, unique story I've seen from BioWare. (Especially with Varric's liberties in the plot.) Even though Hawke is about as bland as Shepherd, the agency for how s/he reacts makes the player feel like this is his/her Hawke.Unfortunately, what was achieved for a greater personal narrative came at the cost of what many enjoy, replayability. Hawke can only be a human, and the only important choice is whether or not s/he is a mage or not. The storyline offers the illusion of agency similar to BeamDog's SoD where the ""role-playing"" is choosing how to respond to a predetermined fate with some greater consequences to decide. It's an experience I think story-driven/lore players would relish more than DA:O die-hards, and the way the issues raised (the Quanari's Qun influence, the Templar vs. Mage conflict and the Kirkwall refugees) are more grey than DA:O's binary options helped me immerse myself into DA. Especially the Templar vs. Mage conflict, which the game heavily reminds you of in almost every other quest and as it's a focal point for the setting of Inquisition.That repetition can also be seen in the gameplay. The best that can be said is how more visceral and fluid the gameplay has been enhanced over DA:O, and the unique setting of Kirkwall is far more memorable over the blandness of Fereldon. Most complaints are levied at the reused locations, which could be fixed if Kirkwall was one massive city like in DA:I. The other issue is the overused Templar vs. Mage conflict.This latter issue I find intentional as the reoccurrence of the possibility of blood magic and other mage-issues may change your mind whether or not you believe mages should be given total freedom. It may instill a prejudice and show character growth towards even hating mages, and I've yet to see another game be as effective as DA2. However, I will admit that DA2 suffers from its quest design and reused assets, which wasn't as much of a problem in DA:O. It is from this misstep that BioWare would learn to address in the next game, DA:I. Dragon Age (3): Inquisition If DA:I asks one question from you, then it is this: What is content to you, and what is it worth? DA:I is by far the most massive of all BioWare games, but it's also the most padded if you're a completionist. If you accept not doing everything, however, then you can find just as an enriching personal experience as DA2 and as a experience driven by player agency. Though of all three, this game lacks consequences.It's strange to complain about lacking consequences in a game that gives you total freedom, but this game does its best to think there are risks. DA2 also suffered from this issue but the guise feels more transparent here. You may lose a character or decide the fate of some NPC in places. The problem is how much of your time is spent doing one-solution tasks vs. player-driven choices. You will never see the same extent of options as much as the amount of choices from past games influences this world.This isn't to say I'm against the base-building mechanics. They are resources that offer many diversions to gain them, including when you're not playing the game, and the grind towards progression helps make the plot feel grander. However, you can easily get caught up in 20+ hours of fetch-quests only to enjoy the story-bits that offer something different. This design does succeed by making the Inquisition feel like our Inquisition (with companions).Companions have never been an issue for BioWare. While I didn't enjoy every single character in DA:O (Sten and Dwarf-Dude) and DA2 (Fenris and Carter), I do like how BioWare has innovated companions for non-squad members. The War Room members, reoccurring helpers (Scout Harding) and other familiar faces lends a lot of close ties in all parts of the organization. The amount of effort to write that much content, let alone program it, speaks volumes for how much BioWare cares for their story-content.Unfortunately, DA:I sacrificed the one thing that made DA so wondrous for me, the excellent pacing, that makes replaying it more daunting than other games.Conclusion & Other Issues with the SeriesIf it isn't clear, I love all these games, but not for the same reasons. However, the biggest issue is its DLC practices (see below).			",327,84,2,55,9,2,27

												Absolutely love this game!  There's a comraderie that you don't feel in other games.  The camping experience to bond with your party and obtain extra quests is wonderful!  I wish they could have put that close, bonded relationship into Dragon's Age II.  Hopefully, we'll have that kind of opportunity in III?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is honestly one of the best games i've ever played. I've played the crap out of this game on the xbox 360 but the pc version is so much better. The graphics on the pc version are gorgeous there is so much detail in everything and the gameplay itself is amazing. It has a good story line and it can be played through many different time. Depending on your race and background story the world reacts differently to you. (im not sure if gender effects it any) This game is definitely worth the price. And if you dont want to play $30 for it then wait until the summer sale and get it then! This game should be played by everybody at least once.			",90,39,2,21,8,2,5

												Dragon Age: Origins has ridiculous replay value. There are lots of different choices to make like who your main character is, which members you want to use in your party, skill trees, story/moral/dialogue choices, etc...My first playthrough took over 100 hours and I plan to start a new playthrough in the future!

												The following review will be my first impression of the game.I bought the Ultimate Edition while it was on sale, and I definitely think I got more than my money's worth. In retrospect, I'd probably buy it for the normal price. Let me tell you why:PROS-In RPG's like Skyrim, ESO, and even Dragon Age Inquisition, I have a bad habit of skipping through dialouge. With this game, however, I found myself listening closely to every single cutscene. I started as a human rogue, so I'm not sure what the other origin stories are like.-The combat is certainly interesting. It's not like the games ahead of this one. In fact, it reminded me very much of Runescape combat. You click on an enemy, and your player auto-attacks it. Of course, you can use your abilities. I have yet to explore the tactical combat system. I just don't like pausing the game to give orders, and it's working out fine for me.-The character customization is decent. One benefit of playing on PC is the availability of mods. While I found the base hairstyles and facial features more than enough, there are some mods to add more choices if you're really invested in your character's appearance.-The followers are full of personality, and you can romance some of them too. -The dialouge options are great for roleplaying. Instead of the standard 2 choices of evil and good responses, there's four or so responses you can choose from to create a more in-depth personality for your character.CONS:-Don't be expecting amazing graphics. It's pretty standard, even on the highest setting. -The movement system is clunky and weird to get used to at first. A and D keys turn the camera instead of the traditional strafing movements offered by newer games. If you hold down the right mouse button you can swivel the camera, which I found to be easier.As someone who played Dragon Age 2 and Inquisition before visiting this game, I can say it's a completely different experience- in a good way. You cannot go wrong buying this game while it's on sale.			",78,11,0,16,15,0,6

Dragon Age: Origins is my favorite game of all times, and I am absolutely loving every bit of it. I must have finished it 5 times by now, and I still find myself drawn to it every year or so. It takes me about 120 hours to fully complete the Ultimate Edition. The Ultimate Edition of Dragon Age: Origins is the complete bundle consisting of Dragon Age: Origins, its expansions and its DLCs in a single release.   Which means that there is a huge world to explore: vast cities, villages, abandoned dwarven thaigs, large forests, underground caverns, ancient ruins, swamps, mountains, towers and citadels, palaces and estates, stores and taverns, caves and highways. Oh, I could go on for hours about all the places you could visit throughout your playthroughs. It's up to you, my dear reader, to take heart and embark on a journey like none you have ever had. And thanks to the insane amount content, detail, customization, and features - every playthrough will grant you a new experience.   There are six origins - background stories for player characters — that are playable in Dragon Age: Origins and a seventh in Dragon Age: Origins - Awakening. These playable backstories will allow the Warden to put themselves in a specific role within the social structure of Ferelden and will help explain motivations for the Warden joining the Grey Wardens. There are three main Races you can choose from: Human, Dwarf and Elf. After choosing your Origins and Race, you will get to choose your Class and Specialization. There are three classes – warrior, rogue and mage – in Dragon Age: Origins, each with four specializations. Six additional specializations were added in the expansion Dragon Age: Origins - Awakening. To be honest, all my 5 complete playthroughs were as a Human Mage. Gifted with a power considered dangerous by most, mages were always my favorite.""Tread carefully, friend.If you intend to cross the path of one whose soul is so tightly woven into the realm of the arcane, I would not suggest you do it lightly.""   Dragon Age lets you create you character from scratch. You get to shape his appearance and choose a set of starting skills and powers. The game quickly envelops you in it's story. Which is a legendary adventure of a Grey Warden and his companions traveling together through the fantastic lands of Thedas, seeking to end the Blight and save the world from being utterly destroyed and enslaved by the Darkspawn. This is a long journey is full of fantasy and drama. Tragedy and Comedy. Romance and Betrayal. War and Peace. Good and Evil.   My Grey Warden was an almighty Archmage. Who wielded the power to crush and dismember the enemy with a snap of his fingers. A true leader, merciful and forgiving, capable of turning foes into friends. A most persuasive character, who tries to resolve every conflict peacefully. A man would help and save everyone, even with the cost of his own life.    The darkspawn are a race of humanoid tainted creatures that mostly dwell in the underground of Thedas. When the darkspawn uncover one of the Old Gods, they expose it to the taint, changing it into an Archdemon, which then leads them in an attack against the surface world called a Blight. The darkspawn are perhaps the greatest single threat to all of Thedas; they are bloodthirsty, exceptionally numerous and willing to indiscriminately kill or corrupt all in their path.   But my favorite part of the game - was the companionship and all that comes with it. On your travels you will meet all sorts of people, because you live in a world full of magic and wonders, abounding with energy ready to be gathered. You will travel thousand of miles, meeting: Humans, Elves, Dwarves and Qunari which could be your friends or enemies, depending on your approach. Some of them will join your cause, becoming your most trusted friends who would shield you from the killing blow. Or perhaps your relationships would develop into something even more wonderful, and they would become your loved ones. Romance and Friendship is always nice, especially when the characters feel this natural and real. Each with their own thoughts and impressions on your current situation. Some of them may approve and appreciate the fact that you're helping innocent people, saving entire villages from being destroyed or just doing charity, while others may think it's a total waste of time, and recommend you to carry on. Their personalities are so full-fledged and so deep, that even the most brief connection can make the strongest and most indelible impression.   Just like in real life, everyone is a stranger at first, and every companion is a puzzle. But with each passing day, you start do discover who they truly are thus, slowly solving the once mysterious puzzle. Depending on your words and actions, your companions will either: become your friends or your enemies, fall in love with you or desert you completely. You can always head to the camp, where you can find all your party members:- Morrigan - a charming shapeshifting sorceress. With a personality as cold as the tips of her pretty little fingers. But beneath all that sarcasm and cynicism, lies a frigid little girl. That wishes to be protected, truly loved and appreciated by people she cares for. [1]Morrigan: Have a care where your eyes linger, Alistair.Alistair: Yes, well don't worry. It's not what you think.Morrigan: I see.Alistair: I was looking at your nose.Morrigan: And what is it about my nose that captivates you so?Alistair: I was just thinking that it looks exactly like your mother's.Morrigan: I hate you so much.Alistair: What?Morrigan: Never mind.- Alistair - a former templar initiate who was recruited into the Grey Wardens not long before the protagonist. A valiant warrior and a loyal friend. He has a good and caring heart, and often will ask the Warden about his or her welfare. While serious and sincere most of the time, he likes to joke around and isn't afraid to appear somewhat childish. Which I think, is a wonderful trait to have. [2]Join us, brothers and sisters. Join us in the shadows where we stand vigilant. Join us as we carry the duty that cannot be forsworn. And should you perish, know that your sacrifice will not be forgotten... and that one day, we shall join you. - Leliana - a bard and cloistered sister from Orlais who sought refuge in Ferelden. She firmly believes in the existence of the Maker, and thus dedicated her life to the chantry. She is a very skilled rogue and a cunning ally. A very passionate and eloquent young lady. [3]Leliana: Maybe we could get you in a nice dress one day. Silk. No, maybe velvet.Morrigan: Stop looking at my breasts like that. 'Tis most disturbing!   The voice acting is extremely well done. All the people you meet feel alive and unique. The music is memorable and epic, Inon Zur quickly became one of my favorite composers.    This game is a true masterpiece. I still get goosebumps every time the battle at Ostagar is about to start. I still shed a tear or two when Duncan dies. And I still get a goofy smile every time Alistair cracks one of his classic jokes. Priceless.   Every creature you kill, every flower you crush, and every choice you make, will undoubtedly affect the world and it's people. And depending on how will you Push the World - the World will Push back.    I would like to talk about every character and every aspect of this stunning game, but it seems that I've hit the limit. And it is time to end this review. I will leave you with this last quote:[/i]""Either you have an enviable memory, or a pitiable life, to know nothing of regret."" [/i]10/10 ",310,62,8,27,25,2,21

												Dragon Age: Origins is a fantastic and nicely well done dark fantasy RPG. It's is very fun to play with endless replayability. You can create all sorts of characters with differnt oirgins such as an Elf archer or an Human warrior. It also has fantastic artwork, storyline, character design, and music. Also with the steam version of Dragon Age Origins you can also activate the game on your Origin account and you will be able to have both the Steam version and the Origin version of Dragon Age Origins. This is also one of the most best best role-playing video games that i've ever played along with other RPG games that I played like Diablo (all of the series), Neverwinter Nights Diamond, The Witcher ( well actually I have the GOG.com versions of The Witcher 1 and 2), and many other RPG games. This a very awesome and highly enjoyable dark fantasy role-playing game with endless enjoyment.10/10 A fantastic and extremly fan dark fantasy role-playing game with endless replayability.

												This is my favorite western RPG ever.If you like bioware RPGs I think this is the best one they've made, good story, good gameplay. It has the traditional RPG classes but with very interesting sub-classes (Who doesn't want to be a blood mage at least once?) The higher difficulties are quite rewarding, requiring a lot of strategy and use of the tactical options, you can set custom rules for individual characters like ""if health is below x% use x ability or x potion"" of course you can read much more on the tactics menu at the game's unofficial wiki page on tactics.[dragonage.wikia.com]If you're still  unsure please give it a chance on sale, but I think this is one of the best RPGs ever made.

												Short verdict: an epic story-driven RPG with all the usual BioWare stuff: moral choices, romance options, a s-h-1tl0ad of dialogues, alternative endings, unlockable character specialisations and mediocre tactical combat system.If you’ve played and liked games like Mass Effect and Jade Empire, you might also like this game. Although combat in Mass Effect was much more better.(If it’s too long to read, just skip to the summary.)The strongest aspect of DAO is the story. It’s very long, very detailed, interesting, but also overwhelming. After 100+ hours into the game, you get tired of it, and just wish for it to end, but it doesn’t. Don’t get me wrong, the game is interesting till the very end, but, at times, it seems that there’s just too much lore thrown at you. When I play games, I play them like this: 1. exploration -> 2. side quests -> 3. main quests, because I don’t want to miss anything. In DAO, after entering a new region, you can easily spend 2 hours just talking with NPCs, before you accomplish anything.The chaotic pacing, in which the game throws quests, puzzles or unlockable secrets at you doesn’t help either. At times, there could be more than 20 or even 30 active quests in different regions of the game’s world.Also, some of the main quest lines are incredibly long, particularly the Fade mission and Deep Roads mission. The Fade mission is so annoyingly long, because of all the mazes and backtracking, that there’s even mod[www.nexusmods.com] to skip it.  And it took me 3 evenings to finish everything in Orzammar and Deep Roads.On the bright side, all side quests are interesting, enjoyable, unique and well thought through. Even the few fetch quests that there are in this game, are nice and cool.However, it should be noted, that although the story is fantastic and engaging, there’s not much new DAO brings to the table. What you have is basically your typical Tolkien universe: elves with bows and arrows that have lost the glory of the civilization they once had and now are living in forests or city ghettos, Viking-like dwarfs who live underground with their runes and golems and crafting, greedy and power-hungry humans and menacing and brainless orcs, which are named “darkspawn” in this game. The class choices are also very typical: warrior, rogue and mage.And, it should be noted, that the game is favouring the warrior class over the other two classes, because majority of your companions are warriors and, also, most of the cool armour sets and weapons are intended for warriors. Mages, on the other hand, have more variable skill sets. I played as a rogue. It was still fun, but I wish I had more unique armour sets and weapons. This flaw is corrected in DAO: Awakening, though.As to the combat system, I think it’s the biggest DAO drawback. The combat is tactical and, although not static, it very much feels like the old RPGs of the 80’s (which I absolutely hate), where you need to take into account the stats, damage type and use either correct form of attack or skill. Another feature that reminds me of those old RPGs, are sudden ambushes, when enemies appear out of nowhere. I’d rather have had just a simple hack ’n’ slash experience, where the outcome is based on my reaction instead of strategy. I wouldn’t mind the planning part; at first, I even liked that I am able to pause the game, switch between the weapon sets, plan which item or skill to use, where to place my squad mates; but later on it turned out that, in narrow dungeon areas, this actually doesn’t play out well, and, even if it did, it still is tiresome to micromanage the s-h-1tl0ad of skills and items you have, after you have levelled up above level 20. Theoretically, you don’t need to micromanage everything, because there are automatic action slots available, but in reality, the automatic actions don’t cover every possible situation, and you still need to switch between the characters and adjust their actions. Fortunately, when you’re maxed out, you can just go and kill everyone, but the strongest enemies, without using any skills or strategy. Believe me, after 100+ hours into the game, that pausing and clicking gets annoying. For me it was so annoying, that I just started using console command runscript killallhostiles towards the end of DAO: Awakening. I was tired of the combat, I just wanted to find out, how the story ends.As to other gameplay aspects, insufficient inventory space (and even insufficient storage space) and lack of money are typical RPG problems that are present in DAO, as well. Also, very often, certain outcomes are dependent on just a few tiny dialogue choices. So save often!The level design is nice and the different areas are detailed and quite beautiful (as far as the dated graphics go). The characters are designed well and thoroughly, each having their unique background (and companion quests for the squad mates). You can engage in dialogues with your squad mates. Your dialogue choices determine their rate of approval of you. And it’s fun to listen to their funny cat fights, while you’re on a mission.As to the graphics, well, the game is quite old, so don’t expect Witcher 3 quality in it, especially when it comes to the textures. But there are a few mods that can improve your experience. I particularly recommend the Redesigned mod[www.nexusmods.com] for better character look. There are also some SweetFX mods available, but, imo, they just make things worse. Vibrant colours mod[www.nexusmods.com] is ok, too.A few words about the DLCs:Stone Prisoner: a fun additional quest that adds an extra warrior to your squad.Warden Keep: a fun additional quest that provides you with a base, where you can buy good items and equipment and also store your inventory. You also get a unique armour set and two new skills.Return to Ostagar: a chance to avenge Duncan, your mentor who dies in the second main quest.Feastday gifts and pranks: special items that can increase or decrease your companion rate of approval.The Witch Hunt: this DLC reveal the events around Morrigan and her child, who is crucial in the next DA games. This story line is especially rewarding, if you romanced and was faithful to Morrigan in the main game.Leliana’s Song: a nice little campaign, in which you play as Lelian - one of your companions in the main game. It tells the events before Lelian became a sister of the Chantry.The Darkspawn Chronicles: a what-if scenario, where you play as a darkspawn warrior and try to destroy the grey wardens of Ferelden. It’s short, boring and feels like a fan made content.The Golems of Amgarrak: just as boring as the Darkspawn Chronicles, with annoying backtracking and particularly difficult combat.Awakening: the best expansion of all. Just as interesting as the main game. The events take place after the main game. This DLC raises your level cap from 25 to 35, it expands your skill set, specialisation options and has better equipment and unique items. Unfortunately, there are quite a few bugs in Awakening, which prevent you from completing certain quests. I had to use third party patches on more than one occasion.So, to sum up, DAO + Awakening is an epic RPG with great and engaging story. If you are a fan of RPGs, this game is definitely for you. Unfortunately, DAO has all the typical RPG flaws, as well. Because of the overwhelming amount of the content, it is better to take breaks from this game, before you finish it. The Ultimate Edition is highly recommended.My overall rating: 8/10. P.S. I played the game on Origin (130 hours), therefore, the short gameplay time on Steam. You can use your Steam key to activate DAO on Origin.			",139,38,1,27,5,2,24

												One of the best RPGs ever made. This is how an RPG should be , with a good story, branching paths, dialogue choices, music, interesting cast of characters, various character builds, cool looking locations & enemies. The final boss fight was awesome. Only downside was the occasional crashing/freezing & the slowdown which is a bit annoying.9/10 Would fight evil & save the world again.			",21,2,0,10,1,0,1

												I'm a grandmother and often simply cannot keep up with many of the fast paced action games out there. However, with the pause capability and the ability to move every character to where I want them is perfect for me. Also the fact it let's me make my own danged decisions counts as well (well most of them...there are some it steers me into without mercy). I admit that I usually play at normal with a few drops into casual which enables me to enjoy the game even more. The fact that I can do that is  a plus, instead of doing a battle over and over until I win  (not that I haven't done that) or worse, be forced to give up. This game is like immersing oneself into a rich story that one mostly controls. Not that fate won't have it's say now and again. A thing that is all to the good. Like the building games I adore, you place one brick after another, each time hoping it's the right brick, and watch your creation expand and grow. Don't get complacent though, as any of your bricks/comments can cause a totally unexpected reaction. I say go for it and enjoy!			",5,4,0,16,15,0,3

												One of the most fun games I've ever played. It came out in 2009 or so and I played it in 2017. The best way I can explain it is this: it hasn't the greatest story ever, nor the greatest RPG system ever, nor the prettiest graphics by today's standards, not the best design or a sprawling open world (which all the cool RPGs must have these days).But it succeds by combining good elements from other great RPG's into a fantastic streamlined experience. I had a great time without ever feeling like I was ""grinding"", there was never a dull moment even though the settings were somewhat familiar from other great and original RPG's or movies. Also, Awakening is a brilliant expansion. I can see why people have hundreds of hours played on this game. Highly recommend it.			",152,18,1,26,15,0,40

												This game... is hard for me to put into words. There is a apocraphyal rumor out there that this game had been developed to completion by BioWare before its sale to EA. And that EA freaked after the sale when they discovered this. But when you play this game, you can see the detail and attention that BioWare put into it. Some would say it is the finest game BioWare ever made (I still say Knights of the Old Republic was better, but this is a darn close second).The quests are epic. The gameplay is fantastic. The characters are well-developed and have rich backstories. There are six origin stories for your PC, and two of them have differences depending on factors (the Magi differs slightly if you are human or elf, and the City Elf Origin differs in a rather signifact way depending on gender). You have some of the greatest companions in BioWare games (Leliana, Morrigan, Sten, even Alistair). The romances make sense... depending on who you pursue.And the background... The Fifth Blight, the Grey Wardens, Ferelden... all of it is wonderful. And then there is the soundtrack... some of it is heart-wrenching.And of course... you have to save the world. And in this game, a lot of that saving is from itself.And since the Ultimate Edition brings along with it all the expansions... it gets even more epic.Cannot recommend this game enough.

												I love this game.There's not enough words describing how amazing this game actually is. Game is basically old, but it doesn't even look like it's old, doesn't even play like it's old, doesn't even feel like it's old.Basically the game is practically awesome and definitely worth buying the Ultimate Edition, because it comes with an amazing Extension pack which is called Dragon Age: Awakening, and it comes with around 10 DLC's which, believe me, bring A LOT more experience to the gameplay.I bought the game recently for the PC version, but already finished the game on the ps3 version.Gameplay is very unique, which brings a new aspect to the game. Storyline is amazing, all the special effects and everything just make the game enjoyable as hell.What I like about the game:- The Gameplay (Controls and other technical things)- The Storyline (You can basically choose from being a Human, to being an Elf, to being a Dwarf and each race comes with it's own story)(I personally like Human race, because of all the armors you can get in the DLC's, which are only wearable by Humans)- The Graphical Aspects of the game (The graphics aren't ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AT ALL!)- The Customization system (Character style choosing, including: Voice of a character, facial expression, etc.)- The Enchantments and Shop system (Self explanatory)What I dislike about the game:- Glitches (The only problem I did notice occuring sometimes..But very Rare, trust me, this WILL NOT ruin your gameplay!)                                     I would definitely purchase the game because its OVERALL amazing.~Quiirex			",27,2,0,7,2,0,2

												Electronic Arts Dragon Age: Origins RPG is for its time a breakthrough for a RPG game.  The Good1)  Play one of three different races, each having a different story line. This is presented at the start of your story.2)  Play one of three classes, Warrior, Rouge, or Mage.  At a higher level the class you choose can be improved to have skills like for example (Holy Smite) for the Warrior class.3)  What you choose to say for your Gray Warden will effect your RPC group and the story outcome.4)  Many quests during the Main story and side quests. To gain coin, favor from RPC's and loot.5)  Have a relationship either male, female, or both! Naughty Naughty!6)  Mixing your group. You can mix and match as much as you want between RPC in your party.The not so Good1) Plot never changes so if you complete the Story at Normal level and play again at Hard level (Ho Hum) you already know what to do.  Of course it may take a long period of time to defeat the Archdeamon's army.2)  What? my (Gray Warden) is a mute? Kinda,  It would have been better to have him/her speak the sentence you have choosen.  When you choose a action for the (Gray Warden) it is acted out during the game.3) Weapons and Armor stay fresh and new, it would have been interesting to have items get worn or become damaged.The game is addictive if you a first time player or return to it after a while.  What is nice with the Ultimate edition is that after you play the main story you can transfer your (Gray Warden) to one of the other stories to start another adventure. ",2,1,0,3,3,0,2

Honestly of all the Dragon Age games out this was and still is the best in my book and overall a very good RPG (back when Bioware was NOT a part of EA). Granted the gameplay mechanics and graphics are a bit dated but the story more than makes up for it (choices that actually matter). I have it for the PC (which is probably the best esp mods imo). For the price it is worth it though on sale it is a must. Story: 9.5/10Gameplay: 5/10Graphics: 7/10Replayability: 8/10 ",14,2,0,12,3,2,6

												This game has immense replay value with all the character origins and Player choices.  The Companions are interesting, in-depth and well-written, and voice acting is top notch.  I found the level design a bit bland, however, and it's quite a lengthy first portion before you get to the ""open world"" part.  Very rich lore, and I'd recommend to any fantasy fan.

												I love this game! It runs fine on my laptop with an Intel graphics card. It has great replayability because of how your choices can change the outcome of sidequests (even a few of the major events) and your character is so customizable, I felt so immersed in the story. I would reccomend this game to anyone. I bought it for the full price, and it went on sale about a week later. I wasn't even dissapointed because I enjoyed it so much I was glad to play it right away, and had I known a sale was in the near future, I still probably wouldn't have waited!			",6,3,0,6,1,0,1

												This game is defintly one of the best games i've ever played and one of my favourites (if not my favourite). The gameplay is great, second to none, the storyline coundn't be anybetter BioWare really knows how to pull it off as shown in also in their Mass Effect Series. The storyline does well to get you attached to the game by making the descions that you make effect how the story pans out for you for the rest of the game and its expansions (classic BioWare tho i must note). The chat dialouges and cutscenes are always dramatic and never cease to bore you and always seem to add to the drama and hype of the already superb Storyline, the quests are never boring and their are endless side quests to do besides the storyline, this game will last you weeks on end.The characters in this game are represented very well, with so many different personallities in the game you are never left short from any chat dialogue. As for things to do other than questes you can't fall short, Poison Making, Trap Making, Tactics, Enchanting, Gathering and much more, I'm sure you wouldn't run out of things to do. As far as i am concerned i have not come across any glitchs or problems though bearing in mind it is a game and i am sure i will encounter one soon enough. I would recomend this game to anyone that really likes RPG games that have a great storyline and good feel overall to the gameplay, this game is like all the good things from The Elder Scrolls Series and The Diablo Series put together it is just great and i cannot stop playing it, best $7.50 i've ever spent and I would be willing to pay the actual price of around $20-$30 for this game because it is worth every cent you pay for. Had this game not gone on sale i would've never bought it, hats off to Valve for putting this game on sale and getting this gem out of the rough. Everyone NEEDS to get this game, you'll regret not getting it.			",117,12,5,17,25,0,4

												Great fun! Dragon Age has you taking on the role of the newest Grey Warden, travelling the lands of Ferelden recruiting allies to fight against a new blight of Darkspawn - a blight not taken seriously by others in the kingdom. This game is definitely the spiritual successor of the Baldur's Gate series, with a deep, complex storyline that twists and shapes according to your choices as the Warden. The excellent writing and voice acting keep the game feeling fresh; I thought the humourous exchanges between different party members were particularly fantastic. I've enjoyed Dragon Age immensely so far and would strongly recommend it to fans of roleplaying games, fantasy settings and those who love a compelling story.			",19,12,0,8,13,0,5

												The first videogame I ever played that made me cry. One of the absolute first PC games I ever owned too. It sat in my library for months upon months until I thought one day ""Why not?"" and I can honestly say without a doubt that after that first time playing it changed the way I saw videogames forever. They weren't hack and slash games for fun, something to pass the time and win achievements in. Oh, no. They were stories, worlds waiting to unfurl at your fingertips of heroes, lost histories, forbidden myths, and characters that stay in your heart forever. Little did I know that by giving this game a chance despite the older graphics that I would come to fall in love with the characters and come to follow the series for years to come. If you ever ger into the series, I 100% reccomend the books which are prequels and sequels to the games and really help bring this amazing world to life. Also if you want insight on Duncan and Loghain, the first two books make you see those characters in an entirely new light.Overall, this will forever be one of my favorite game series, something I can keep coming back to--to meet the characters and explore the world once more... and fall in love with them all over again.

												Depressing as it is to know that this (and Mass Effect 2) were the last good Bioware games, Dragon Age Origins stands as one of my favorite games, considering that it is one of the few games that I can enjoy from start to finish. Pros:-The game contains a great amount of content. You can easily sink 60 hours into the base game-The cast of characters following the protagonist are memorable and well written. In fact, they are about on par with the cast in Knights of the Old Republic-The gameplay is well balanced and may often require you to use your brain, especially in higher difficulty settings-The dialogue is well written, and your character's attributes may determine what you want him or her to say-Each of the 6 different origin stories are very entertaining, and even offer a degree of replay value-Your choices in the game actually have an affect on the outcome of the story and are far from black/white, as a cunning player may find a compromise if all the availible options are assessed-The soundtrack fits the mood quite well, though (aside from a few tracks) there's none that really stand out to the point where I'd go out of my way to listen to itCons:-There are difficulty spikes in certain areas of the game-The tedious fade section-The extremely akward romance scenes-Magic can be quite over powered to the point where it takes only one mage to influence the outcome of the fight-Although the Player Character can do some very horrible things, there isn't exactly an ""evil"" endingVerdict:Dragon Age Origins is an extremely entertaining role playing game that offers a vast amount of content. If you are a fan of Bioware games, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by not playing this. If I had to rate the game, I'd give it a 9/10.			",23,4,0,15,0,0,2

If you enjoy rpg games you should definitely not miss out playing this great game. It's highly replayable with many character classes, story changing choices and interesting companions with their own personalities, and a single playthrough can go up to a hundred hours or more.

												Dragon Age Origins is a game of fierce strategy, engaging characters and amazing narrative.You start the game off in one of the various origin stories. Almost all of these are well done, and serve to really lend an identity to your player character. After that you are thrust onto a tale of revenge which prompts you to gather all of the various powers in the land toward survival, or risk extinction.What Dragon Age Origins does well is moral ambiguity and effective characterization. All of your party members have unique and interesting backstories, many of whom are entirely optional to recruit and you could just as easily murder them if you please. This also extends to the villains, who are all very complex and have some of the best dialogue in the game.This is the Ultimate Edition which includes all of the paid DLC Bioware released, including the expansion pack Dragon Age Awakening. All of the little DLC like the preorder packs have already been released for free. Making this the definitive edition of the game, and a must play for anyone who likes RPGs. Bioware also released an SDK for the game, and hundreds of modifications have been released for it. Take in Dragon Age Origins, few games like it are still made today.			",338,42,5,36,12,5,30

												I finished this game last night live on stream. It took me about 3 weeks of playing for about 3/4 hours per night. It is a fantastic game with an incredibly amazing storyline and well thought out characters. The game is left open for replayability because of the way you can a) pick different characters/background b) the way you can delivery yourself to the AI in the game and c) the difficulties. I played the game on Normal throughout, however I could easily go back and play it on Easy for a more RPG style type of game or on a higher difficulty for a more stategic style type of game, which I will most likely do. The music as well in the game is fantastic. I would highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys diving into a vast world with lots of story and characters where you can pick how you play! 10/10 from me!			",606,178,8,74,59,2,52

It doe's however have slightly clunky gameplay for those that are not used it its isemetric view, party combat style but is fun to play if you know what you are doing.In short its a regular Bioware game.10/10 would be willing to sacrifce my life for anyone of my party members and feel truly guilty for any bad choice's I make or those that die because of me, again			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is fantastic! It is worth to complete it many ways. Every crew companion is a self-standing story. Maybe the whole game system is not exactly Baldur's Gate succession, as it suppose to be, but it is great after all. I truly recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't let the few hours played fool you - I have a full playthrough and then some on a non-steam version.This is truly a great game - it offers several different stories and events, and what you do can really effect the later ongoings.A good and long story makes this one of the best RPGs the last 10 years. The story clocks in between 40 and 70 hours, depending on how many of the branching stories you wish to explore (and how long you take doing that). Add in epic monsters, multiple followers (all with their own personality), and mountains of loot, and you have a winning combination.			",220,53,3,23,22,2,42

												Recommend? Yes indeed. If you like old school rpg games. For those that dont like to read, plz stop now lol.Will say that other users who commented on the single version DAO are right when they say there is less content in comparison to other old school rpg's. Weapons, clothing, armors are limited but can be compensated through a mod that allows you to craft ur own items. Storyline is great, I have played the game before it came on steam and will say like so many others have played at least over 15 times. The race origins gives a lot of replay value, since certain storyline characters and items can only unlocked through that specific origin. Every origin also contributes a different game ending and influence on the post game world. Many mods available to influence this. Lot of lore to read for those that realy want to get everything out of the story, not as much as in TES4 Oblivion (good god) but still more than enough.One may argue the classes available for choice are limited to only 3 classic classes being: warrior, rogue and mage. Then again this is compensated with specialisations or if you want to translate into d&d language: multiclassing and yes with no pentalty. These classes are sometimes unlocked through relations with companions (regular no romance) and sometimes by purchasing manuals of that class or making certain decissions during the storyline that allow you to obtain said class. U can also choose what type of class u will get through levelling, meaning to say for example: a warrior u can choose to invest in two handed skills,  sword and shield skills and supportive skills, allowing u to build the type of character u want. Also the same with companions so u can shape ur party just the way u like it.Once again, lot of replay value.Storyline is pretty much rpg classic, first starting out not knowing what is happening, struggling through the story halfway, getting better, and in the end be the hero and save everything. Great storyline with almost every classic element you could wish for. This being a game that unlike many others, combines graphics and a good story line. Battlesystem in the early going can be a lil confusing but if you have played these type of games before, no sweat. For everyone something, storyquest about mages, elves, dwarves, the holy grail (has other name in game), and the corruptive nature of men, could have been LOTR if that hadnt come out sooner.Character companions are also very varied, going from those with noble origins to common crooks and murders, drunk warriors and a stoic giant who just likes to be sarcastic and put everyone down. Good thing is that they have written these characters in a way that any player can certainly recognise one self with fragments of those characters' story. Every companion also has a personal quest that allows the player to greatly enhance their relation with said companion. Other ways are to give them presents. With higher relations comes that companions get a specific bonus to their stats. (for example, +strentgh for warrior, +willpower for mage, and so on.)Few bugs that remain unsolved with certain side quests but those can easily be undone, plenty of reading material on the net on those right now.Awakening: good storyline once again allthough I will say that it is somewhat short in comparison to the original campaign. To say when it launched: they stated that origins would give the player over 70 - 80 hours in game to complete, in comparison Awakening was announced as having a even larger amount of space to explore then the original but with only between 20 - 30 hours of game time to complete, they may have run a lil short on that one, but in the end is it worth it? Oh yes. Is launched in game as a separate campaingn so doesnt go along with the main campaign, but like the main campaign also has an epilogue showing the result of the player choices made during his/her progress. New things, few new materials, few new companions, and guess what you become senechal (local lord) of your own keep and can judge people (comes back in DA Inquistion, spoiler).The rest of the dlc in short:Return to ostagar: adds background story and closure for the Alistair companion of the main campaign.Leliana's song: gives u a backgroundstory on the Leliana companion of the main campaign.Witchhunt: give prequel story to what Morrigan has possibly planned for the events in DA Inquisition(spoiler)Stone Prisoner: Gives u an additional companion through a short storyline (comparable to Zaeed in ME2 or Jarvik in ME3)Golems of Amgarrak: Dwarven history (lotr compare, in the end balrog like battle) and for me the hardest to play, lot of puzzles and difficult battles.Warden's Keep: Discover the sinister origins of a merchant family and in the process claim a castle for urself to enjoy. Darkspawn Chronicles: Play as the enemy, invade, pillage, burn...leave none alive.In short (ironic I know): Is it worth getting, no question, eventhough it has a few flaws here and there ramaining, everything else you get more then compensates for it. And for me one of the best rpg's I have ever played. Will certainly not dissapoint.			",20,1,0,6,5,0,17

												A special game. The story line is excellent, moving and exciting and the potential for character interaction and development is impressive. 3+ unique beginnings and freedom in how you play your role in the world; different classes, moralities, approaches. This is no 'open world' but the freedom of choices and strategies is better than this; A great title to rival its contemporary 'The Witcher'			",73,13,0,17,5,0,21

												Dragon Age: Origins is one of those rare games which profess to offer a deep, meaningful degree of choice and then truly deliver on that claim. Here you will create your protagonist and forge a clearer picture of just who they are with every decision they/you make.But they won't be going it alone. A handful of diverse companions will become available as you progress, each with their own agendas and intricacies. The campfire conversations had with this bunch are among the most memorable in the game.The gameplay is also worth noting. The selection of abilities available as characters level up means that two of the same class can be made to suit very different roles, allowing multiple playthroughs to feel genuinely unique. Combat against large numbers of powerful enemies can result in some very satisfying use of the tactical options to achieve victory, particularly in the higher difficulty settings.The story's central conceit -- a shattered kingdom under siege by a great and powerful darkness -- is incredibly well written, and sets up countless opportunities for the protagonist to make defining moral choices. It may not sound particularly imaginative, but BioWare have done a stellar job at making this trite fantasy framework their own.To summarise: Dragon Age: Origins is absolutely not one to miss.

												I just started playing this game again after I got a little bored with Skyrim and Eve Online.Dragon Age: Origins is an amazing game.  It's graphics have withstood the test of time, and the story has a way of still feeling fresh: even though I am playing as an elf rogue, again, the number of choices that affect the outcome make it feel like a completely new experience.  The only real complaint I have is that the camera controls are a little dodgy at times, but this is a minor gripe and it has not deterred me.Bottom line: if you're are currently on a budget and want to experience an amazing RPG with deep lore, strategic combat, and an amazing story, then you should buy this now.  If you are really on a budget, put it on your wishlist and buy it when it is on sale.			",59,17,0,20,4,0,5

   My Playthrough   Youtube Playlist    The Review Dragon Age: Origins as it stands is one of my all time favorite RPGs. This game succeeds at so many points. The game has a great story, setting, gameplay, characters, and mod support. I love the setting of thedas as it has so much potential for stories that can span multiple games. The great characters are what really help this game stands out from other similar RPGs. Every character is memorable, from the companions to the NPCs. Every companion is a 3 dimensional characters. And if you personally dislike a companion you will never find yourself outright hating them. The gameplay is very much like that of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic which is also a very good game. But the by far best aspect of this game is the story. You can choose from multiple origins, races, and classes. And these choices and the choices made during the main quest makes each playthrough different. This is one of the few games that I played through more then 20 times. The downloadable content add much more hours of gameplay plus with the mod support this game gets even more hours of replay value. This is by far one of the best RPGs I played and I can't recommend it enough.  ",2392,978,75,299,289,29,372

Only way i could get the others was going through Origin. Havent had a chance to test if my content from here will add to the ones over there.***			",13,20,0,25,20,0,4

												This is easily one of my favorite games of all time. The plot is completely fascinating, the characters feel like real people, and your choices will have far-reaching consequences. Sometimes doing the right thing is not the best option, which is why this game can be absolutely visceral. The graphics are a bit dated, but with some artful modding (and there are some fantastic mods out there) and a little imagination, this game is a true adventure.The sheer size of this game is startling. Not in maps (of which there are plenty), but in depth. The characters all have fascinating backstories, but the world itself is what truly shines. The codexes in this are nearly an art form. This is a living, breathing world, where religion, politics, and simple humanity are the most beautiful and poignant characters, rather than the companions that walk with you.			",16,1,0,12,1,0,1

												I honestly couldn't give this game a better review. The characters are brilliantly dynamic and interesting (ZEVVIEZEVVIEZEVVIE)-- they have personalities and lives; romance subplots actually feel like falling in love, and although gifts can make romance easier, it doesn't feel forced or rushed. The combat, although linear, is engaging.  That story tho. Seriously, the story is amazing. It's exciting and fascinating.Ugh. This game tho. Beautiful 11/10			",15,2,0,21,2,0,1

												Why is everything so pink????Not.. the prettiest game to say the least, but one of my all time favorite rpgs. Especially with Inquisition coming out in a couple of months I greatly recommend it.Plus you can mod the begeebers out of it.Extremely story rich with amazing characters, ridiculously uncomfortable looking uderwear and a protag that occasionally emotes! And dragons. The dragons are very important.9/10 would bang.			",37,7,0,6,3,0,0

												This is easily one of my favorite games of all time. The plot is completely fascinating, the characters feel like real people, and your choices will have far-reaching consequences. Sometimes doing the right thing is not the best option, which is why this game can be absolutely visceral. The graphics are a bit dated, but with some artful modding (and there are some fantastic mods out there) and a little imagination, this game is a true adventure.The sheer size of this game is startling. Not in maps (of which there are plenty), but in depth. The characters all have fascinating backstories, but the world itself is what truly shines. The codexes in this are nearly an art form. This is a living, breathing world, where religion, politics, and simple humanity are the most beautiful and poignant characters, rather than the companions that walk with you.			",16,1,0,12,1,0,1

												Threatening to kill anyone who doesn't co-operate with you seems to work for everything. So carry around a big battleaxe and threaten to cleave everyone who dares to even look at you.

												Amazing on so many levels. Every origin story is unique and immediately attaches you to the character choice you created. Battle situations are intense and well thought. Every time I failed a fight I was able to reevaluate my moves and restructure my teams tacticts to fit the encounter. AMAZING storytelling, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t quests just progression. If you dont mind stepping back half a generation and are looking for a genuine RPG experience pick this up for what you can. You will have 40 hours of beautiful gaming joy.			",78,6,0,9,5,0,10

Witches Don't Wear Bras - An Official Waffle King Review~Find more here.[lordwaffleking.com]Swords and junk are pretty cool. When I was little I liked to pretend that sticks were swords and swing them at the kids on the bus stop that I didn't like. They always said to watch out or I'd poke their eyes out. But I showed them. Oh, I showed them. Little did I know, that was little baby Waffle King's first little foray into the world of roleplaying games. I could be whatever I wanted, and I could wield powerful weapons beyond your imagination. Like those perfect sticks that make whistling noises when you swing them.As I grew older, of course RPG games would be a genre I got pulled back to time and time again. But in this day and age, true roleplaying games have become harder to come by. The big guys upstairs, the game publishers that control what we play, they don't want those. Because you know what, those games are hard. They're really hard. Making choices is hard. Consequences are hard. It's so much easier if you can just mash buttons and make things happen. And if you want to learn every skill? You can do that. It's okay.Hardcore RPG's aren't a genre that's explored often by big publishers. They're a niche type of game. One of the biggest developers of RPG's of that nature, Bioware, is still around. But sadly, there's a lot of corporate fingers in their♥♥♥♥♥They've made some of the greatest RPG classics. And some other games. Those were alright. Even after being acquired by EA, they still put out a number of quality games. Before, you know. It happened. RIP.Dragon Tales Origins was one of the first games to come out under the new EA and Bioware partnership, launching on Xbox 360, Playstation 3, and PC; it's a spiritual successor to Neverwinter Nights and the acclaimed Baldur's Gate games.Ever watch that one movie Lord of the Rings? Kinda like that, only you get to bang a witch.She doesn't really wear clothes or anything. She has some shower curtains or something over her shoulder.Dragon Tales is a pretty good game. A hardcore tactical strategy RPG, with an emphasis on the roleplaying aspect. You become the guy with the sword that does the things. You are him or her. You get to bang that witch and save the world. It's all you, buddy.A grand tale of zombies and witch ♥♥♥♥♥♥s, Dragon Tales Origins is extremely heavy with lore. They really went all out trying to build this fantasy world. They got the elves, the dwarves, and all that good stuff. Completely original lore, totally not just Lord of the Rings with some things switched around. In fact, they were so proud of their work they even went and named it Origins. They were planning ahead. They already knew it was gonna be big. They were gonna make a series out of it from the very beginning. And♥♥♥♥♥♥ they really wrote a ♥♥♥♥ing book. It's a book, a book with some RPG elements mixed in. I didn't pay attention in History class, the ♥♥♥♥ you think I'm gonna memorize the lore of Dragon Tales for?It's written well at least, and the characters are a joy to be around. They're colorful and multi-dimensional, and you can sex them all up. Not all at once, they get mad at you for trying to do that. Which is definitely holding me back from giving the game a perfect score. You can even do gay things in Origins, one of the defining features that made it so popular with the Tumblr crowd. You can gay things up, and that is clearly what gay people look for most in their games. They're mostly awkward teenage girls actually, they love gay sex more than actual gay people. But you know, this is exactly what they look for in a game and they're free to like what they like.Writing would be what I'd say is Dragon Tales' best trait. It's visually a little dated, with a pretty good soundtrack. But the writing, ooh wee, that's some good swords and magic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. An RPG like Origins thrives on writing, though. It's all about pulling you in, letting you live the role of a dude with a sword in a medieval setting.The only problem with this setup is that the game mechanics aren't quite welcoming to the whole swords thing. In fact, I really wouldn't recommend using swords at all. Just don't, for your own good.You get to build your own character and assign them one of several backstories, races, and classes. It encourages you to make many different characters, to see the story from different angles and to make different choices to see the outcome should you have made one choice instead of the other. But what the game fails to encourage is using any class other than mage. Really, the mage is the best thing to play and is the only thing I'd recommend.A knight or warrior's job is to walk into monsters and take up space while mages attack and heal. Rogues are fun also, allowing you free rein over the battlefield to just kinda walk around, stab guys in the back, and all that good stuff. But mages get the most cool things to use. Exploding lightning, blizzards, and summoning giant spiders and♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's the definitive way to play this game by a long shot. Not to mention how poorly balanced they are. If you're fighting enemies and there's an enemy mage, you gun for that guy first because he can crush your entire party in no time. And it's the exact same vice versa. So you're gonna want to take good care of your mage.You get to order your party members around as well, so if you do choose to make your main character something other than the best class in the game you can always just play as ♥♥♥♥♥ witch. Who is the best character in the game.Ordering around your allies isn't exactly optional however. They don't really have much in terms of AI. Their default tactics are to headbutt monsters while singing the U.S. National Anthem, The Star-Spangled Banner. Classic song, great song. But it helps out much more if you can command them to fight strategically. You have to pretty much program them through a bunch of clunky menus, which is my favorite thing in a game. You know me, I like my menus how I like that♥♥♥♥♥ Hard to handle and all over the place. If it takes me less than ten minutes to get from Point A to Point B, it just isn't clunky enough. I want to spend hours trying to work that♥♥♥♥♥ Menus and asses like that are a true work of perfection and are the clear indicator of brilliant game design. Swapping between characters on the fly works well if you're gonna fight that way also, but also can be very intensive during major fights.I'd still consider it one of my favorite RPG's, even if it has numerous little flaws and hasn't aged well in some regards. I've enjoyed multiple playthroughs, and it is still fun the second and third time. There's definitely a clear right way to play it, which is as a mage and on PC. Keyboard shortcuts, hotkeys, and the superior camera controls and options really make it the definitive way to play. But it's still decently enjoyable however you should tackle it. PC users have mods though also, so you can see uncensored ♥♥♥♥♥♥s and stuff. That's why people mod stuff in the first place.It's a wordy game, full of reading and numbers and nerd things. But it's immersive and fun, and a testament to Bioware's secret formula to making some of the best RPG's. Well it's not exactly a secret, you just need to be able to sex people, commit genocide, and unite the many tribes to vanquish a great evil that you told everyone was coming and no one listened.Dragon Tales always reminds me of raisins though. When I first played it, I was just kind of marathon-playing it and needed a snack. But there was nothing at all to eat in my house. Nothing but raisins. And it was a giant industrial-size can of raisins too. It had like 100 servings or something. So I just ate raisins while I played. That's all I had. I've learned from my mistakes, and I keep other things stocked up now. You just gotta live and learn, man. Just live and learn.			",156,15,0,29,5,0,7

												Fantastic game, one that has kept me stuck in my seat for a few weeks, as I loved the main campaign so much I purchased all the DLC. I love the combat, and the many options available make replaying also quite alot of fun. The best thing about Dragon Age is the voiceacting.OMFG.Such wonderful banter between teamates, and so well done. Do yourself a favor and add different teamates, switch it up when you can, because they all have so many lines and interactions it is well worth itAs a lifelong gamer, I have played hundreds of rpgs dating back to the original ultima series in the early 80's. this is one of my top 3.

												Dragon Age: Origins was the game that set the bar for me when it comes to fantasty RPGs. It is, without a doubt, one of my favorite games ever. The story is compelling, extremely dark and well-thought through. There wasn't a moment when I felt the game was bad, even if it has a few frustrating parts. It takes you on an incredible journey and let's you make very hard decisions along the way. Even though the combat can feel a little clunky at times, it doesn't hurt the rest of the game. You have intriguing companions and interesting ways to expand your friendships with them. It has great replay value if you are interested to see how the game's world will treat you as a different race, class and with different choices. I recommend this game 110%.

Gameplay wise is some of the best I have seen in a RPG and the combat is quite deep with tactical planning. To conclude, if you want a long RPG or just a good story look no further.

Posted: January 26, 2014
												I overall enjoyed this game and consider it Bioware's swan song. The origin story chosen by the player impacts not only your dialogue options, but also the level of classism and fantastical racism encountered. The female Dalish elf has few rights, lives in poverty(walled off segregated part of the city), and gets taken to be a mistress for the local noble. She has little social mobility and only gets out of her scenario from being enlisted by the Gray Wardens. There is no social justice, only results matter from her actions afterward. This provided for me a sense of agency in my actions versus being dropped into say roleplaying as Geralt of Rivia in the Witcher series. The Noble female noble’s story is also one of revenge. Yet she can still do more. She can by my count simultaneously be: Queen consort of Fereldan, Teyrna of Gwaren, the second in line heir to Highever, Commander of the Grey in Fereldan, and Arlessa of Amaranthine. That is like... Michelle Obama if she was also Governor of Florida, heir of California, and Mayor of New York City and Marshal General of all the armed forces. There are many origins but only one Duncan to help that origin character. The others origin characters are dead if they do not get enlisted. The player can encounter the Dwarf commoner’s corpse in a part of the plot. With no Duncan to enlist him, he refuses to eat and thus dies in prison. The format of the vanilla campaign follows the usual Bioware formula. The main character must travel to four locations, solve the local issues and convince that faction to help in the final battle. You are hunted by the darkspawn and will encounter a vision/dream sequence with the big bad. As you travel you will encounter the ruins of an ancient civilization (lost dwarven thaigs/Prothiens/Underdark) lost over time yet full of artifact tier items and lore. The gameplay is similar to Baldur’s gate but does not rely on the daily spell count limit of D&D gameplay. Mages are far stronger than many other classes for regular enemies. With some exceptions such as the Gaxkang lich battle. This game reminded me of Baldur’s Gate a lot. If the Warden badly handles decisions, party members will leave the party and even challenge you for leadership. The backgrounds of the characters should be considered in your political dealings. During the Landsmeet, if you arranged for Anora and Alistair to marry it can backfire if you let Loghain live and join the order to redeem himself. To conscript Loghain into the Wardens will make Alistair furious. To Alistair, joining the Grey Wardens is a sacred duty and honor, it is not a death sentence. By contrast, if you let Alistair execute Logain, Anora will break down the political alliance as she cannot marry the killer of her father. What I found charming in this game was the fact that character interactions and growth seems to happen naturally. Alistair’s reception to mages was something I felt was handled very well. His early training was that of a Templar, a role sworn to strike down mages if they are taken over by demons of the Fade. Yet Alistair is scared of Morrigan and neutral to Wynne. At first glance you may think he hates all mages. But the reason he distrusts Morrigan so much is not just because she is a mage. Rather the issue is that Morrigan is a maleficar, someone outside of the rules of the Chantry. She practices unknown magic (shapeshifting, is neutral to blood magic rituals, etc) that he has been taught all of his life is evil and wrong. He is actually terrified of her.

												This is one of the last BIoWare games that *felt* like a BioWare game after their acquisition by Electronic Arts. It is a RTwP RPG with a pretty average main plot, but what makes it shine is the excellent writing and personalities of the companions you pick up on your adventure to stop the big-bad. If you play this game the right way, you will grow attached to the characters after spending 20-40 hours killing monsters with them, learning about their past, goals and desires along the way. Each character is distinct from one another, and fleshed out to make you really care about their ultimate fate. That doesn't stop you from being a complete scum bag to them, which yeilds its own rewards in the form of comedy (At least for me)The combat system is accessible, but not simplistic enough that you can go into each battle and not use tactics, (Not on higher difficulty settings at least).  Some battles require a great deal of thinking in order to devise the perfect strategy to take down a large group of enemies, or a tough boss. There are a large number of skills and talents to learn as you level up, as well as 3 different classes to choose from (Rogue, Mage, Warrior) which each have a few of their own sub-classes called specializations which also hold different abilities to learn, which makes the game extremely replayable right off the bat, even if there weren't multiple ending (Which there are). But there are also different Origin stories, as the title suggests. Dwarven Noble, Dwarven Commoner, Dalish Elf, City Elf, Human Noble and Circle Mage, which adds even more replayability since each origin story and race choice changes certain dialogues, the opening act and even certain missions down the road.Those who can't get enough swag will be delighted to know that there are plenty of epic armor, weapons and other loots to be found here to slaughter things with, which makes it a pleasure to play if you can't get enough of the cosmetic side of RPGs. The only thing I have a problem with is that the mage class has a very limited selection of rather boring robes to sport, and that is disappointing. There are also plenty of sidequests to complete over the course of your adventure, which range from dull fetch quests to epic dragon slaying.So in conclusion, the game is quite good. The characters are memorable, the combat is fun and challenging, plenty of armor and weapons to choose from, multiple endings and hours of content to play. It is well worth the money, in my opinion.That is all. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Brilliant game. Excellent choice&consequence, extensive lore, solid RPG mechanics and combat, though held back a lot by over-reliance on the MMO healer-tank-DPS archetype, instead of sticking with the D&D mechanics that made Baldur's Gate great. But still, the combat is engaging and never too easy. A lot of content also - 54 hours in and I have only completed the main game; I still have to do all the DLCs as well as the expansion pack Awakening. Dragon Age: Origins was probably one of the best RPGs in the few years before and after its release. It's a shame about the sequels because Bioware could have turned this franchise into something truly great. Origins looks, feels, and plays like a cRPG, and was developed primarily for PC, but its sequels had a console audience in mind and it shows. The squandered potential of Dragon Age is just one more thing EA has run into the ground. ",114,22,11,29,34,1,25

												I LOVE BioWare RPGs, and I ♥♥♥♥ing -LOVE- Dragon Age: Origins!I first played it on Xbox 360, and then replayed it, and replayed it, seriously about fifteen times (plus every 'origin' story), not to mention all the time spent to unlock certain achievements.The game has a myriad of complex, flawed and ultimately loveable (or loathable) characters, with a consequence (or reward) for your every action. The world is vast, steeped in history and lore, and though the game is set only in the one country, Fereldan, you still get a sense of the larger scheme.The gameplay... It took me a little while to learn the controls on the 360, but I'm finding this time around playing on PC the controls are a little more intuitive. Everything else seems to be the same. Fully customisable tactics for your party members, interchangeable weapons, armour and skills, class specialisations, crafting, healing, set and skill bonuses, auto attack and quick slot skills, and the ability to pause the game in order to issue commands.When I saw the Ultimate Edition on Steam, all bundled together and so damn cheap I knew there was no question, I had to get it!Still the same epic game I fell in love with all those years ago <3			",7,2,0,6,0,0,1

												Buy it, especially if it is five bucks! DAO is heralded as the best Dragon Age game ever made, having been the only one I've ever played so far I can't compare it to the other Dragon Ages. But I can say from the moment I started this game I am thoroughly impressed with everything it has to offer. I keep thinking wow Skyrim came out two years after this?? The facial animations are amazing as are the million dialogue options to choose from. The dialogue has more depth than Mass Effect even! I used to own DAO on hardcopy back in the day and paid over 10x more than I did here LOL. So yup if you like strategy and rpg this would be a GREAT thing to add to your library! 10/10 for DAO			",97,13,0,19,10,0,9

												Dragon Age: Origins is one of the BEST games I've ever played.It has it's ""bugs"" and certain times the game would crash before I would save but it didn't matter because I HAD to finish the story. The best part about the game is that you can make choices so you don't just have to do exactly what the game thinks you should do. You unlock different achievements for taking certain paths, you end up having people turn against you, or you completely change the direction of the game; it's absolutely marvelous. You can make characters fall in love, you can make the decision to kill someone or save them. The battle scenes are amazing, the story was so heartfelt, dark, and powerful; I actually remember the game bringing me to tears at one point.I recommend this game for ANYONE who loves a great RPG with a fantasy storyline. It’s like a zombie apocalypse has come to destroy the land and you have to build a team to defeat the them before it’s too late!Brilliant game.			",25,8,0,7,4,0,6

												Graphically this game is starting to show it's age (this can be somewhat compensated for however with mods), but despite some awkward animation here and there it still looks beautiful and is a joy to play. Of all the Dragon Age games I'd say that Dragon Age: Origins and Awakening are still the best. DA:O offers the most diversity in character creation, roll playing, and character building than in any other Dragon Age game.Dragon Age: Origins - Ultimate Edition comes with the main game which will take approximately 60hours to complete if you do everything. It also comes with every piece of purchaseable DLC.-Warden's Keep; travel to Soldiers Peak to discover what happened to cause the Grey Warden's to be exiled from Fereldan 200 years prior to the events of the game (also adds 2 new abilites per class and a storage chest for items)-Stone Prisoner; aquire a Golem companion character named Shale-Lelianna's Song; you play the events that lead to one of your companion character's ending up in the Lothering Chantry (completion unlocks items for Origins/Awakening)-Darkspawn Chronicles; this DLC is a ""what if"" scenario for Fereldan if your character had died just after the prologue (completion unlocks items for Origins/Awakening)-Dragon Age: Awakening; this expansion sees you, or a new character, rebuild the Grey Warden order in Fereldan after the events of Dragon Age: Origins. This expansion alone adds an aditional 30hours playtime at least.-Witch Hunt; find out what happened to Morrigan, one of your key companion characters, after the events of DA:O (completion unlocks items for Origins/Awakening)You can also go to the Bioware website using your EA account to unlock all the promotional items (preorder bonuses and sh*t like that) for free.This game boasts an epic story, memorable characters, and creates the foundation that the other games have used to stand on. The other games have their own epic tales, but they all lack the same kind of urgency you get from playing DA:O and trying to thwart the 5th blight. This game is great value at it's RRP, but if you see it on sale I'd say it's a must buy.			",178,33,2,23,7,4,19

PROS:+ 6 different origin stories (tied to 3 races & 3 classes)+ epic main campaign+ party banter+ companions & their stories+ TONS of decisions that affect the story+ complex skill tree+ fantastic mod support+ special finishing moves+ superior combat tactics to other DA games+ UE has additional missions inside the main campaign - Warden's Keep, Stone Prisoner, Return to Ostagar+ UE has additional DLC campaigns to main story - Awakening, Golems of Amgarrak, Witch Hunt+ UE has alternate DLC campaigns - Leliana's Song, A Tale of Orzammar, Darkspawn ChroniclesCONS:- some skills can be buggy under certain circumstances- decisions can glitch out when exporting between main campaign and the additional DLC campaigns- couple of promotional DLC items are missing in Ultimate Edition on Steam- majority of the DLC items become useless very early in the campaignComment:I bought this game, again, here on Steam because it is such a good game. I would say one of my favourite games ever.  At first you choose between 3 races - humans, elfs, dwarves and then between 3 classes. Afterwards you get to pick an origin. The six various origins make you start the game at various places and this adds to the roleplay element. Eventually all origin stories continue into the main story at Ostagar, but even after that your origin affects how NPCs react to your character. The main campaign has that epic quest feeling to it and I cannot say much without spoiling. The main premise is a darkspawn invasion led by the archdemon and you are the last hope to stop it. On your way you will pick up companions and solve various side quests ... or you won't, it's your choice. Either way there is a huge amount of content here that will get you playing for many many many hours. That is even expanded upon by the expansion Awakening, DLC Golems of Amgarrak and DLC Witch Hunt ... all of these can share 1 character that you import from the main campaign. The mod support is really really good in this game. It is easy to get into and even I made a mod and helped on some others. This support is a bit worse in DA2 and basically non-existant in DA:Inquisition. And that is a shame because mod support is one of the things that keeps games alive very long and bolsters the fandom around the game itself. The graphics are not as pretty as newer DA games but it still has a certain old RPG charm. And mods can fix a lot of the character models in the game or adjust the look to your liking. EA involvement was already visible here with 2 DLC missions and a DLC companion on game release. Despite that, the DLC feel fun for the most part. I could go on about every campaign and mission available here but it is too much and all you REALLY need to know is that the majority of it is fun and worth playing if you are into RPG games. Enjoy!			",279,50,4,30,15,0,22

I literally feel like I want to buy the rest of the games in the series.It has better voice acting, better quests, and better combat/magic system.

												Dragon Age: Origins offers one of the best single-player rpg experiences on th PC. It has a rich and detailed lore surrounding the game world that sets up the stage for your adventures in the game. The main story is also very intriguing and is full of twists and turns that will keep you entertained for the whole ride. It also offers many side-quests that flesh out the world with many unique stories, and every conversation you have reveals more information about the world of Dragon Age. If you love a good fantasy world, than Dragon Age doesn’t fail to disappoint.The story is the traditional Bioware set-up, with a bit of a twist. When you create your character, you get to pick a race, an origin and a gender. Depending on your choices, the characters in the world will treat you differently. More importantly, you play a short 30-60 minute intro story that is unique to your origin. Then there is a 30-60 minute general intro sequence that you play, before the world opens up. You have to travel to multiple different locations, in any order you choose, in order to get different factions to pledge their loyalty to you for a battle against the game’s main enemy, the Darkspawn. Each area you go to have its own problems that you must sort out before they will pledge allegiance to you. Like everything you do in Dragon Age, solving these problems tells you more about the society and world of Dragon Age. The story continues on and ends in a grand finale. The main is very interesting.			",78,1,3,14,3,0,0

												I cannot say enough about this story game ... If ever there was a game that pulled one in with a sense of glory, desire, intensity, and reaching for meaning, this would be the game. At least of the many games I have played by this time in my gaming life. To be able to play the developing hero is like being the myth, actually BEING the Myth.			",69,18,1,19,8,0,10

												I'm having more fun in this game than I did in Skyrim. I literally feel like I want to buy the rest of the games in the series.It has better voice acting, better quests, and better combat/magic system. Overall it's a great game. 9/10The only downside is that you have to create an Origin/Bioware/EA account to access your dlc and get achievements.			",43,1,0,10,0,1,9

												Graphically this game is starting to show it's age (this can be somewhat compensated for however with mods), but despite some awkward animation here and there it still looks beautiful and is a joy to play. Of all the Dragon Age games I'd say that Dragon Age: Origins and Awakening are still the best. DA:O offers the most diversity in character creation, roll playing, and character building than in any other Dragon Age game.Dragon Age: Origins - Ultimate Edition comes with the main game which will take approximately 60hours to complete if you do everything. It also comes with every piece of purchaseable DLC.-Warden's Keep; travel to Soldiers Peak to discover what happened to cause the Grey Warden's to be exiled from Fereldan 200 years prior to the events of the game (also adds 2 new abilites per class and a storage chest for items)-Stone Prisoner; aquire a Golem companion character named Shale-Lelianna's Song; you play the events that lead to one of your companion character's ending up in the Lothering Chantry (completion unlocks items for Origins/Awakening)-Darkspawn Chronicles; this DLC is a ""what if"" scenario for Fereldan if your character had died just after the prologue (completion unlocks items for Origins/Awakening)-Dragon Age: Awakening; this expansion sees you, or a new character, rebuild the Grey Warden order in Fereldan after the events of Dragon Age: Origins. This expansion alone adds an aditional 30hours playtime at least.-Witch Hunt; find out what happened to Morrigan, one of your key companion characters, after the events of DA:O (completion unlocks items for Origins/Awakening)You can also go to the Bioware website using your EA account to unlock all the promotional items (preorder bonuses and sh*t like that) for free.This game boasts an epic story, memorable characters, and creates the foundation that the other games have used to stand on. The other games have their own epic tales, but they all lack the same kind of urgency you get from playing DA:O and trying to thwart the 5th blight. This game is great value at it's RRP, but if you see it on sale I'd say it's a must buy.			",178,33,2,23,7,4,19

												If you prefer your RPGs to be story- and character-heavy (at the cost of, say, wide-ranging open-endedness) and party-focused then this is a beautiful game.Some strengths and weaknesses:+ Story.  There's quite a bit of writing in here.  It's mostly serious but there's quite a bit of intentional comedy.  Don't forget the DLCs.   ""Golems of Amgarrak"" wasn't anything special, but ""Leilana's Song"" is a nice short prequel.+ Lots of side quests+ Characters; a number have a good bit of story and personality to them.  Voice acting helps a good deal.+ Decent game flow and control; pause+give orders, cooldowns, limited scripting ability+ Modest system requirements compared to today's hardware, but still pretty+ Mostly quite usable UI; plenty of room for skills on the quick-selection bar, for instance+ Old enough that it's a likely on-sale target, and will be an excellent bargain when that happens+ Range in difficulty settings; if you're playing for the story rather than as a hard-core gam3r l33t, set it to the lowest difficulty and you'll be fine, for instance~ Some flexibility; the story arc is mostly set out, but there's still a fair bit heavily influenced by your choices~ No main-mission timer; you can complete many, many side quests if you wish.  This gives flexibility and allows you to experience more, but some may find it bad for immersion when you're undertaking these and seemingly not treating the Big Bad with as much urgency as it might demand.- Instability; crash bugs, at least if making heavy use of magic- Occasional but sometimes very nasty scripting bugs- Sometimes awkward camera positioning.  There were definitely times I'd wished for having either a true first-person view (rather than over-the-shoulder third), a true straight-down view, and/or transparency controls for walls, arches, etc.- A few notable UI omissions like no estimates of value unless you're at a merchant- Yet another RPG where you can't scribble notes on the map, *sigh*			",49,30,0,12,10,0,16

												One of the best games I have played. Old and gold. Unique artstyle, amazing soundtracks, interesting storyline with legit lore. Characters and companions are not made out of cardboard and more good stuff!I enjoyed playing Origins more than Inquisition. Inquisition felt more like a console action RPG which is streamlined is many aspects.Took me a memorable 70+ hours to complete the game with Awakening DLC. Definetly worth playing this game if you're into RPGs or story rich games. I even bought a copy for a friend who was a Telltale games fan and he loved it.			",23,2,1,5,0,0,1

												The combat is a little clunky as it can't decide if it wants to be real-time or turn-based, but if you're already familiar with the KOTOR games it shouldn't bother you too much. It has all the standard Bioware flaws (occasionally flat acting, goofy romance hooks, a story centered around an ancient evil and a prophecy) but also all the charm and memorable characters you get with Bioware, too. It also has some unintended hilarity in the form of a huge, mutant dog (name ""Dog"") who will actually lick the copious blood effects off of your armor after every fight if you ask him. But you never should, because walking around town talking to nobles and merchants soaked in blood after killing a single rat is one of the funniest parts of the game. Well, that and Alistair, becasue he's such a pushover.If you like RPGs or just Bioware romance simulators, grab the Ultimate Edition, especially if it's on sale.			",242,34,1,28,13,3,27

												Tired of all those boring, unoriginal RPGs that all look and play the same?  Then this is the game for you!  At first glance it might look like your typical Warrior/Mage/Rogue trio, but it's the specs that really make it different.  Well, maybe not for Warriros and Rogues, but the Mages is where it's at for this game and that, for one reason.Arcane Warriors.  Now this is the♥♥♥♥♥♥  Hard to play but when played right, will turn your squishy mage into an invincible tank with enough auras and flashy effects to melt your graphics card... along with every enemy unlucky enough to cross your path.Add to that a huge game universe filled to the brim with juicy lore and you've got a game that will easily take you over 100 hours to clear a single playthrough... if you hurry up.

												Dragon Age is a fantastic RPG that lasted longer than I thought it would. I finished it in 40 hours, but it could easily take you 20 hours longer to complete everything.The characters have depth, the story is pretty good, the graphics also still look very good and the gameplay is tight for a 3D RPG. It can be a bit unbalanced at times though, so I had to change the difficulty from time to time in order to advance. It's disappointing but, it never really frustrates. The isometric view is actually very helpful and, in my opinion, works better than the default camera view. I do admit that the default view is the more cinematic one, but for the later battles isometric view is recommended, required even.Dragon Age is a title that I immensely enjoyed. It's one of the better RPGs of the last decade so if RPG is your thing you should definitely play this.(Play the second one as well. Despite the repetitiveness of the environments it's also well worth a playthrough and it's not as bad as people say it is).[Rating: 92/100]			",1661,635,69,221,194,16,225

												One of the best RPG out there, with hours upon hours of content, especially if you get the Ultimate Edition which brings all the game's DLC in the bundle, adding even more hours of gameplay and some interesting campaigns that differ from the main one, showing us more about certain characters, even allowing us to taste being part of the evil faction.I will add here some points that go for the game and some that go against it.Pros:+It is a long game with a lot of content, a rare thing to find these days.+It's side quests are where the game really shines, with a lot of ways to entertain the player in many different ways.+Your choices change things in the world around you.+It's background story is astoundingly well developed (As we have come to expect from bioware since games like KOTOR)+The PC version has a more in depth tactical mechanic than its console counterpart, you can pause the game at any time to    give orders to your followers or to plan how to tackle certain enemies.+Various origins to choose from that affect dialogues troughout the game. (Hence the game's title)+Many build options and various specs branching from three base classes: Warrior, Mage and Rogue.Cons:-If you are someone that values graphics over other things keep in mind that this game came out in 2009, so it is bound to be graphicaly outdated (The graphics aren't bad tough).-The main storyline is kind of typical and straightforward, and depending on your choices it might end in a way that leaves you with a bitter taste.-The relationship system with your followers is not that well done, you might find that the character you are trying to romance in their highes approval level and still don't show any interest in taking your friendship further.-It has mods, but the game's modding mechanics are kind of tough to get acustomed with, especially if you are new to modding games.All in all it is a very good game and while it isn't perfect, since it is a mess to activate the dlc for some people, for example, it is a game that I do sincerely recommend.10/10 -would play again-			",278,19,2,32,10,0,12

												In the veins of Baldur's Gate, with relatively modern yet deep control scheme - the game that can be played in many different ways.A big plus is the option to choose a difficulty setting (and change it during the game as you wish), and the game's ability to tune the monsters to your own level, thus always providing a reasonable challenge.The story of DAO is captivating and very well thought-through, there are no big head-scratchers or points where the game would take your freedom of choice away. Each major plotline has at least 2 very different ways to resolve it, and you can on several occasions try to ""play it for both sides"", which results in some cool plot twists.I'd also like to highlight the fantastic Fade - this game's ""Mental world"", which you will visit on several occasions and where you face demons and emotions in place of ordinary monsters. This is one of the best portrayals of spiritual world I have seen.It is easy to forgive this game the few issues it has (such as the inability to plan ambushes for those enemies who have a conversation prior to the fight), because the game, as a whole, is a masterpiece.

												An amazingly immersive RPG with a great story and greater characters. As with most Bioware RPGs the main focus of the game is the story and the moral choices you make; what really impressed me were the choices aren't always clear cut good and bad; those choices not only affect the game but also influence how the characters you travel with feel about you. The combat system is strategic and challenging and playing the PC version means you can easily control the flow of battle with the zoomed out view, allowing you to better plan out your attacks and makes for a more satisfying experience than it's console counterpart. The character customisation is extensive and choosing the origin story really feels as though your character is fleshed out but don't expect too much from the origin story later in game as it only affects minor aspects of the dialogue and unique encounter for each origin. Dragon Age is a very good all round RPG which you will easily sink hours into, plus it has an impressive catalogue of mods which can really add to the game so be sure to check those out too!

												This is one of my favorite RPG games and I consider it to be one of the best of it's genre. Dragon Age has some outstanding well-written characters. The combat system is a great, and once you get used to managing your party and using their unique abilities, combats becomes easy. Your freedom to choose makes this game really good. The story is avarage and will always be the same, but there are few choices you can make that will change the ending. In my opinion is this game even better than Skyrim because of the freedom you'll have. You will lose yourself in this adventure for many hours. This game is worth paying, even on sale, and if you are a true RPG lover this is a game you shouldn't skip.			",57,0,1,9,3,0,0

												This is a fantasy RPG. Any fan of Fantasy knows the tropes. skipping, forest dwelling elves; gruff, axe wielding dwarves, mages, klknights, kings, you get the idea. If you hate the tropes themselves with the flames of a thousand suns, then this is not for you. However, if you are say a fan of the Tolkien Tropes, but want to see them done with some originality? Buckle up. Dragon Age Origins is the last of the CRPG days of Bioware. it has an internal conflict. it has the Kotor side, the timed combat, the pause-strategic elements, and the Modern Bioware(ala Mass Effect) side, the large setpieces, the more action-based combat. this internal conflict, to most studios, would be a challenge. Bioware nails it.Dragon Age has one of the best video game narratives I have ever played. It has a large cast of characters, very few of which I have found to be uninteresting. There are tropes, yes. The witty swordsman, the wise mage, the dashing rogue, the drunken dwarf. these tropes are there, but not out of lack of originality. Remember when I said there was the two Biowares in the game? there are also the two fantasy styles. You have the Tolkien style, saving the world from a horde of hellspawn, saving the innocent and all that. You also have the George R.R. Martin style. you determine where you stand on that spectrum. for example, a certain artifact being revealed and used again could cause a large amount of death and destruction, but if you do use it, it could give the Darkspawn a real beating, and give the Dwarves a chance to take back their lost cities. Do you save lives, but lose the power of the artifact? or do you be the Pragmatic one, and take the artifact, using its power for a good cause?This is not a movie, it is a game, so you want to hear about gameplay. To be honest with you, it can be slow. mods can alleviate the slow combat speed, but the fact it is nthere is a problem. It is not bad. Simply dull.(actually, it can be better if you play a rogue, with faster combat speeds.) another issue is that an entire playstyle is ineffective. that would be the Archers. Archery for some odd reason is very underpowered. the bows are too slow and do too little damage. Other than these issues, it plays well, albeit in a dated RPG style(abilities with cooldowns, no jumping, timed animations for attack, etc.)I dislike numerical ratings. I prefer to tell you the games that I feel go with this.if you like Mass Effect, then play this, but expect a bit slower combat. If you liked bioware's storytelling better than their gameplay there, then you would love this. If you enjoyed the classical Bioware RPGs(Kotor, Baldur's, Neverwinter, etc.) then you will enjoy thisIfr you enjoy the storytelling of the Witcher franchise( hard choices with consequences, etc.) then you will enjoy this.If you enjoy Tolkien and A Song of Ice and Fire, then you will enjoy this.

												Just picked this up a few days ago and already logged 15+ hours. Dragon Age: Origins provides a rare combination of storytelling and gameplay that doesn't happen often enough. The story stories are genuinely interesting and even gripping at times. I played through the game when it first came out, and replaying it now feels just as pure as if I never played it before. Kudos to the writers for not only the fascinating world and compelling tale of The Warden and company, but also for fleshing out massive subplots spanning continents that do not feel rushed or forced or lacking. I go into games like this expecting a nice main story with a lot of extra ""other"" to round out the game and keep players busy, but not necessarly keep them interested. Boy does this game break that mold. Even the most trivial of subquests has detailed descriptions and actual writing behind it. Not just flavor text--actual writing that's just as good as the main story. This creates a world that swallows you up. Hours pass and they feel like seconds because your brain is vacationing in another land.Gameplay is likewise wonderful with several caveats. Much like other fantasy games, most notably the Elder Scrolls series, Dragon Age: Origins has trouble with combat feeling like combat. Floating damage text appears seemingly at random, disconnected from the strike that caused it. Hits do not feel like hits. With the exception of mage spells and occasionally arrow hits, it feels like your attacks are just cosmetic--superficial animations to represent math taking place within the code. I referred to this in Morrowind and Oblivion as pillow-fighting, and it holds true for this game for the most part, though not as extreme as those examples. The other caveat is character collision and movement. If you bump into a companion, your character's movement hesitates. If you click to attack an enemy and then press your action skill button, your character's movement hesitates. The result is a crowding problem in large masses of enemies that makes the game harder than it should be for reasons that shouldn't exist. I started my most recent playthrough on Nightmare difficulty and had to start over on Normal because highly intricate maneuvering is simply impossible in many situations, especially if you play a melee class with melee companions, all clumping up in a stuttering mess of movement hesitation. Enemies, as you can guess, do not have a problem bumping into each other or players. This is something unique to Dragon Age as far as I know, no other game I've played his this problem, and it's frustrating.However, the good aspect of the gameplay makes up for both caveats. You can customize your characters stat distributions, innate skills, ability trees, specializations, items, and choose from I think 8 different companions to aide you. There are four main classes and each class has four specializations. Playable characters have the same innate skills, such as combat training, herbalism, poison making, coercion, and more, and each class has a series of shared and custom abilities or talents that let you choose active attacks/spells/etc and passive boosts. It's a very deep system, keeps you interested, there's always something you want to unlock and build toward with your characters. Your chosen abilities are used via the traditional skill bar system, but you can pause gameplay at any time to issue orders. The gameplay can sometimes feel like a strategy game, especially if you play it on Nightmare difficulty, because you're constantly pausing to cycle through your characters and issue strategic commands, telling the mage to use crowd control while your melee take down the enemy leader, or shooting a heal to your tank when his potion is on cooldown. This gameplay is optional for normal difficulty though. Instead, you have what the game calls tactical slots, which are a kind of ""if/then"" subroutine AI for your character and his or her abilities. You can choose from presets or customize your own, and you can unlock more tactical slots as your character grows. I can't recommend this game enough. It doesn't feel dated or flawed at all, don't let its age, nuance, and the reputation of its sequel fool you into thinking it's not worth playing. It is. It so is. Dragon Age: Origins is great.

												A fun game with the best dialogue Bioware has ever done. I'm a HUGE Bioware fanboy and in series like KoToR or Mass Effect you choose either all Good or Bad choices because of an alignment tree, which doesn't allow you to make the character that reflects you. In Dragon age all the choices reflect how you are as a person, no alignment tree no incentives to do everyone good or bad it's how you want to play. It makes you really get lost in this wonderful world. With all that said the combat system is very  unique...and that's not such a good thing. Let's just say I struggled through the combat system and was rewarded with a great story. Although hey you might like it, so it's 100% worth picking up if you want an 80+ hour RPG adventure with lots of very fun DLC.			",88,20,0,15,4,1,7

												I'll be brief. The origins story was thoroughly enjoyable, I highly recommend it. I often complain about lack of depth in game stories, but this time I cannot. The only criticism I can come up with is that the depth of the Dragon Age universe, as it appears to me after one playthrough, is so overwhelming that I don't even want to keep exploring it anymore. You forget one thing a character has said and because of that you subsequently make a bad moral decision hours later. I'll leave it at that. ",57,20,1,6,6,0,8

												This is THE MOST amazing game. I don't much like strategy, but I can't imagine this game without the strategy side of it. The characters have depth and personality that makes them feel real; I am crazy attached to quite a few. The humor in it had me smirking and occasionally laughing out loud, and yes there are dramatic moments... but they're not overplayed or drawn out. They're what you would expect, but better. I was frustrated when I finished the game because I thought ""My God, they've done it so well that I CAN'T write fan fiction of this. The quality would be nowhere near.""Often the ultimate edition is on sale for like $8. HUGE steal. BUY IT!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Finally after many years I managed to complete this gameDragon Age is deffinitely my favourite RPG series. Despite the fact I played them in the wrong order I didn't get too many spoilers because they are only softly connected to each other with storyline.Graphic on full details looks good but its pretty buggy, especially when you get to the city, which forces you to play on combination of low and medium details.Storyline is pretty interesting and easy to follow to. Sidequests are good too, you can make your gameplay easier by doing them. Combat mechanics are simple and doesn't require you to spend few hours on learning what's what.And my favourite thing, character creation. The character creator gives you possibility to make your character look the way you want (or at least close to it because its still one of earlier versions of creators)Its a game I can fully recomment to all RPG lovers			",71,4,0,24,11,0,12

												A brilliant tactical RPG with a refreshing story(for once the main characters actually feel vulnerable) and a compellingly challenging gameplay, that will often force you to either rethink your approach on combat and tactically distribute your damage, or die at the hands of high level random encounters.The game really is what you make of it. Dedicate little time and just rush through, your story will be fairly mediocre too. Do sidequests and shape the world to your liking, the story will respond to it. This game has every thing.

												8/10I recommend this only if you have not played it by now and want some background for Inquisition.Origins was predictable and slow paced. I am not a big RPG guy but the difficulty seemed unbalanced, much pausing was involved. I was fighting mobs above my level because I skipped some sideQs in the big city. I mean an enemy is at the gates and yet you have plenty of time doing all the inconsequential stuff. Some stories just are not fit for an RPG. The finale was kinda easy. I had a harder time dealing with the game when I got swarmed by 20 zombies. Awakening expansion was more tense, locations and story were better than the base game. Difficulty was balanced.Further DLC that I enjoyed was Witch Hunt. Amgarrak was sometimes boring but second best, it was a bit challenging since I did not have a healer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you enjoy rpgs driven by story and the choices you make having an impact I recommend  this game for you! This game has a multiple companions that can either love or hate you based on your decisions. Also many of your decisions impact the world in some way or another. The overarching story is seen as generic by some and in someways it is, but it is still a very good story. On the combat side of things this game has party based combat in the style of Baldur's gate where you compose a party consisting of you and 3 companions of your choice.  I would recommend getting the ultimate edition over the regular edition because the awakening expansion is very enjoyable. The other dlcs also add to the game and are fun aswell.  You will get many hours of enjoyment out of this game, not only is one playthrough long but there is a lot of replayability due to how many class combinations and decisions you can make. So overall I think this game is well worth the 30 dollar price tag but it is a good decision to wait for a sale as it usually drops to around 7 dollars which is an amazing price for how great this game is. I would give it a 9/10.			",154,8,3,28,12,0,25

SummaryA captivating RPG experience that easily stands shoulder to shoulder with classics like Fallout and Planescape: Torment.ReviewDragon Age: Origins is, in a word, awesome. Think of everything you love (and some things you might hate) about role-playing games, and that's DA:O.I'll get the bad things out of the way first simply because there are so few of them. First of all, there is tons of combat in this game. That's both a good and a bad thing, though. The combat system is, in fact, extremely well designed, interesting, and most importantly loads of fun. The problem is that there's sometimes too much of it which can feel like a bit of a meaningless slog on occasion, especially during some of the lengthier travel segments. My second criticism is that sometimes dialog choices don't actually make any difference during conversations and lead to the same generic response from an NPC. Thankfully, this is largely the exception.And that's it, really. Everything else about the game is absolutely stellar. The hallmark of the RPG genre is meaningful choices and consequences, and DA:O excels in this area. Quests have multiple solutions, conversations often play out radically differently depending on player choice, and your decisions during quests and conversations have an impact on your companions' relationships with your character. Consequences can be minor, such as lowering a companion's disposition towards you, while others are more substantial, affecting and sometimes limiting your available options later in the game. It all feels very natural and dynamic, and you'll often find yourself wondering what would happen if you had made different choices which contributes to DA:O's excellent replay value. Quite often these choices are not black and white with obvious ""right"" and ""wrong"" paths laid out before you, and you'll often find yourself trying to untangle a moral quandary. For instance, when a young boy is possessed by a demon, do you defeat the demon by killing the boy, or by allowing his mother to sacrifice herself in a blood magic ritual? There's no easy answer to that sort of dilemma, and many of DA:O's quests hinge on such decisions.The lack of moral certainty is refreshing for this genre, because it allows you to play a nuanced evil character, offering role playing choices that are deeper and more interesting than the usual ""evil guy = jerk"" one-dimensional characterization that many RPG's tend towards. It also happens that the morally good choices do not always bring the best rewards, so the player isn't at an automatic disadvantage for not walking the straight and narrow.DA:O features an epic story that could possibly be criticized for riffing on Tolkien, but then, what fantasy story doesn't? However, BioWare added enough of their own unique twists to the setting and narrative that they can legitimately call it their own. One area where DA:O shines in particular is how well realized the game world is. It's clear that BioWare put a lot of time and thought into this aspect of the game and developed a detailed and plausible society. Everything from history, local politics, national politics, religion, cultural divisions, and the plight of the common man is fleshed out in considerable detail making Ferelden feel more like a real place than a fictional world. I personally found the dwarven culture with its rigid caste system to be particularly fascinating. To give you an idea of the kind of attention to detail we're talking about, BioWare doesn't just declare that it's based on a caste system and that's it but actually delves into ancient dwarven history to explain exactly how the system developed in the first place. Much of this information is conveyed through codex entries which unlock as you progress through the game, and there is, in fact, quite a lot of reading to be done in DA:O, but it's well worth your time and perhaps even necessary to get the most out of your experience.And what an experience it is. The main game will take you around 60-hours to complete, and if you get the Ultimate Edition (and you should) you can add another 20-hours for the Awakening expansion plus several more besides for some of the smaller campaigns like Witch Hunt and The Dark Spawn Chronicles, so there's around a hundred hours of gameplay for your first play-through, and with its branching storyline, interesting moral choices, and 6 unique origins stories based on your choice of character, there's plenty of incentive to play again and again.Trust me, this is one you do not want to miss.

												DA:O is one of the best RPGs I have ever played. The story is very well written. The characters are interesting. The companions are unique in their own ways. This is one of the few rpgs that manage to make me care about my companions. I actually spent more game time to make sure my companions have a happy ending in the epilogue; very few games succeeded in immersing me into their worlds like that.    ",92,11,0,19,13,0,5

												Dragon Age: Origins will withstand the test of time. I don't want to go into a long review, but I will say a few short things. First, the combat is generally fun. It has its downfall's, but the tactical camera, numerous amounts of perks, and ability to switch characters always breathes life into combat. The graphics actually aren't terrible considering how old the game is. If that sort of thing really matters, go to Nexus Mods and install whatever you see fit. DA:O's story is fantastic. At first, I had to push my self to keep playing, but once I got to the open world the hours just flew by. There is a considerable amount of lore that I recommend you learn (it makes the whole experience more enjoyable), but it is not required. The DLC is a blast, no problems there. If you're interested in Dragon Age: Inquisition, I STRONGLY recommend you play Dragon Age: Origins. Playing Dragon Age: II would be handy, but I wouldn't consider it essential. If anyone has any questions, please send me a message. I love this game, and I would love to answer your questions.			",172,29,5,23,14,0,21

												Wow, I haven't recommended this yet. Jesus Christ.Top-tier RPG at its finest. Incredible character interaction, compelling story, moral decisions, and all around awesomeness. It's the kind of game you wish you could play 'for the first time' again, and then play it through again anyway. With 6 origin stories, 3 classes (Not including specialization classes or sub-classes), this will keep you busy for quite a while... especially if you're a completionist.			",373,37,5,65,15,3,41

												If you enjoy rpgs driven by story and the choices you make having an impact I recommend  this game for you! This game has a multiple companions that can either love or hate you based on your decisions. Also many of your decisions impact the world in some way or another. The overarching story is seen as generic by some and in someways it is, but it is still a very good story. On the combat side of things this game has party based combat in the style of Baldur's gate where you compose a party consisting of you and 3 companions of your choice.  I would recommend getting the ultimate edition over the regular edition because the awakening expansion is very enjoyable. The other dlcs also add to the game and are fun aswell.  You will get many hours of enjoyment out of this game, not only is one playthrough long but there is a lot of replayability due to how many class combinations and decisions you can make. So overall I think this game is well worth the 30 dollar price tag but it is a good decision to wait for a sale as it usually drops to around 7 dollars which is an amazing price for how great this game is. I would give it a 9/10.			",154,8,3,28,12,0,25

												Dragon Age, when it arrived, was a game that I had been waiting on for a very long time. Having been criminally denied more KotOR (which is what I truly wanted), this was as close as I was going to get to that same feeling; Squad-based tactical RPG with a heavy emphasis on character interaction, development and choice... Just describing it makes me want to fire it up again.The setting and tone is similar to Game of Thrones, but before the show even existed; A dark fantasy that delves into intrigue, mystery, deception and tragedy. Not to mention a heavy dose of epic adventure. Of course the game doesn't always take itself so seriously, taking cues from its predecessor by implementing some charming, quirky characters and an overall sense of hope in the darkness. The consistenly excellent writing, VO and art design all come together in a way that helps you get lost in the universe they created.The story, and how it unfolds, is really quite good. As the name suggests, your origin is important, and what you choose to be at the beginning will have a noticeable impact on your path. However, everyone ultimately finds their way into the arms of the Grey Wardens, a jedi-esque order of warriors devoted to stopping a horde of darkspawn from spreading throughout the land. They recruit you, train you, and before you know it, throw you into the fire. What happens in the next 40-60 hours is for you to discover. That number will of course grow considerably if you get all of the DLC. Origins is unique for a modern Western game, in the sense that it is actually fairly challenging. The enemies, especially a few hours into the game, are tough and it only gets harder. Even on normal difficulty you will likely get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked a few times, soon to realize that a strategic approach is the best way to succeed. The combat is complex but it makes sense, taking the fundementals of KotOR and making it even deeper.Of course now having said all of that, it looks like I'm going to be playing it soon... You should do the same.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Easily the best RPG I've ever played. In fact, as of the writing of this review, I'd go as far as to call this the single greatest game I've played on any platform - and that's coming from someone who's been gaming since Atari.Dragon age is a powerful, engrossing experience. The world is massive, the back-story immense. If lore is your thing, you'll find scattered throughout Ferelden enough lore to fill 9 novels. The characters are EASILY the best developed I've ever encountered. Spend enough time playing and you really feel like you connect with them. They have so much personality; and their voice acting is flawless. It really makes you care about them. The combat is polished and perfect for PC (if you played on console and were frustrated, it's not even REMOTELY equivalent. Being able to lay out all your attacks and click the ones you want is much more natural) - lots of strategy and customization options. Perhaps best of all is the story. I've never played a game that's done a better job of presenting the player with choices that will truly alter the story on the fly. This gives it IMMENSE replay value. I've played through this game a dozen times, and it was wildly different every time.If you've grown disenchanted with the increasingly j-pop influenced Final Fantasy series, try Dragon Age			",679,203,26,81,61,11,129

												Ah yes, the good and uncomplicated dragon age.  Frankly this one is the best in the series.  Not because of controls or mechanics, but because the richness of the story and uncomplicated essence of the characters.  You hold an attachment to them and want to complete every aspect of the game to drive on their adventures.Essentially if you want to play a dragon age before the series became a politicly correct statement on minority rights and long narratives on how Casey Hudson thinks that anyone that disagrees with his agendas is clearly a moron and dosn't deserve the time of day, play this one.If you do however want to play more ""socially diverse"" games, please see Dragon Age II.  Less gameplay, more statements.  Or Dragon Age Inq, a little more gameplay this time, but we still wanna give you a liberal arts lesson as well.9/10 - Masterpiece			",20,1,0,18,0,0,13

												One of the most excellent WRPGs in recent memory. While things slow down around the Deep Roads, it never fails to add new, imaginative characters and encounters that spice up the game. Combat is a strategic dance, with traditional roles (tank, healer, etc.) and new specializations that fit the unique enemies you fight. Best of all is the interaction system. Each and every character in this game is like a living being, and interacting with them feels natural and realistic. The game always finds ways to test you, whether it be your combat process or your strength of character. 9/10.			",180,27,1,33,11,1,22

												I've played this game all the way through in every possible way on the xbox 360, at least 500 hours i reckon, i never put it down. this and mass effect 2 are my most favorite games of ALL time, oh and Timesplitters 3, but yeh this is an amazing Role playing Game. you make a character and feel so connected to every conversation, they have a responce for every kind of person. as an example there is some wounded guy near the start of the story who needs your help and you can just say your too busy, and when the people with you argue that point you can just say hes already dead... see... and slit his throat lol. may not seem like much but its little things like that that make this game what it is. my favorite character to play as was a Dalish Elf because there are so many occassions where people are racist to you being a elf and you can reply like a total badass and its just mint. I know I'm rambling but i could talk for hours about every single part of this game and it would be praise. it has passion that so few games have nowadays. and this is all xbox stuff, on PC its even better, iv installed like 3 mods and its like re-living the amazing fantasy i love all over again. and not only that but without the mods it seems like they're more changes in dialog. and its interface and mechanics are different to xbox that make it more tactical and fun. Just Understand that if you've played this game on a console in the past, get it again because it is a NEW and amazing experience . and if you've never played it, just trust that if you dont get it you will miss out on the best rpg EVER!

												Bioware's Dragon Age: Origins, vanilla or with all the released content for it, has been one of my all-time favorite games, of any genre, of any platform, that I've played since I started gaming back in the early 1980s.  If that isn't enough of a statement to help you decide if this game is good or not, or 'worth it' as so many ask, then I don't know what else I could say to make it so.I just love the storyline and characters so much, to the point that I actually got emotionally tied to some of them.  As the storyline develops, based on your decisions throughout your questing, you'll come to love certain characters, and come to actually hate and loath others.I can bet you, that once you've played through the game a certain way, you'll want to play through again, just to see the storyline from a different perspective, and then yet again.Like for myself, I've played through the vanilla game on Xbox360, then with the DLC packs, then got Awakening to play through it yet again.  But I also wanted to experience the game on my PC so I bought it for my PC as well.  And I'm not done yet...  I just saw the Ultimate Edition on Steam for a crazy low price of $7.49 so I said, ""Why not!  I want to have it on Steam as well!  It has EVERYTHING that came out for the game, in one edition.  Well duh, I guess that's why it's called Ultimate Edition I guess, right?""It's just that GOOD!Bottom line is, if you like RPGs and/or Action RPGs, then you have to get this.  You won't be taken seriously when you say you know action RPGs if you've never played it, and that's the truth.Huge thanks Bioware, as if Baldur's Gate wasn't enough of a classic, you give us another.Want to see one of the best game trailers ever made?http://store.steampowered.com/video/17450/5452Feel free to share your favorite characters and why below in the comments.

												An amazingly immersive RPG with a great story and greater characters. As with most Bioware RPGs the main focus of the game is the story and the moral choices you make; what really impressed me were the choices aren't always clear cut good and bad; those choices not only affect the game but also influence how the characters you travel with feel about you. The combat system is strategic and challenging and playing the PC version means you can easily control the flow of battle with the zoomed out view, allowing you to better plan out your attacks and makes for a more satisfying experience than it's console counterpart. The character customisation is extensive and choosing the origin story really feels as though your character is fleshed out but don't expect too much from the origin story later in game as it only affects minor aspects of the dialogue and unique encounter for each origin. Dragon Age is a very good all round RPG which you will easily sink hours into, plus it has an impressive catalogue of mods which can really add to the game so be sure to check those out too!

												This is a truly Brillaint RPG! The story is fantastic that gets you hooked into the lore and makes it hard to stop playing. The combat provides an engaging tactical element that while perhaps not the most advanced, is thoroughly enjoyable to play. It's rewarding if you get the detail right in fights (activate I'm awesome god mode) or swiftly makes you pay for making mistakes! Character development is interesting and highly adaptable so you can play your character to how you wish to play it and still be competetive. I would highly recommend this game as a thoroughly good investment for any RPG player out there.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It is not perfect, but it is very solid in its mechanics and gameplay, and on that basis I recommend the game.A shame its successor went and injected even more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ soap, goof along with a gibberish console-interface and stripped away all tactical elements of the game.

												One of the most excellent WRPGs in recent memory. While things slow down around the Deep Roads, it never fails to add new, imaginative characters and encounters that spice up the game. Combat is a strategic dance, with traditional roles (tank, healer, etc.) and new specializations that fit the unique enemies you fight. Best of all is the interaction system. Each and every character in this game is like a living being, and interacting with them feels natural and realistic. The game always finds ways to test you, whether it be your combat process or your strength of character. 9/10.			",180,27,1,33,11,1,22

												I've played this game all the way through in every possible way on the xbox 360, at least 500 hours i reckon, i never put it down. this and mass effect 2 are my most favorite games of ALL time, oh and Timesplitters 3, but yeh this is an amazing Role playing Game. you make a character and feel so connected to every conversation, they have a responce for every kind of person. as an example there is some wounded guy near the start of the story who needs your help and you can just say your too busy, and when the people with you argue that point you can just say hes already dead... see... and slit his throat lol. may not seem like much but its little things like that that make this game what it is. my favorite character to play as was a Dalish Elf because there are so many occassions where people are racist to you being a elf and you can reply like a total badass and its just mint. I know I'm rambling but i could talk for hours about every single part of this game and it would be praise. it has passion that so few games have nowadays. and this is all xbox stuff, on PC its even better, iv installed like 3 mods and its like re-living the amazing fantasy i love all over again. and not only that but without the mods it seems like they're more changes in dialog. and its interface and mechanics are different to xbox that make it more tactical and fun. Just Understand that if you've played this game on a console in the past, get it again because it is a NEW and amazing experience . and if you've never played it, just trust that if you dont get it you will miss out on the best rpg EVER!

												One of my favorite games of all time along side Mass Effect and Kotor, this game detailed, rich, and full of adventure. With multiple starting races and starting locations that effect your character's experience throughout the game, it's easy to find yourself playing over multiple playthroughs - even if you normally don't. The combat is a blast, just don't try to get through without pausing! I've arguably never had so much fun. EA buying Bioware is one of the sadder events in gaming history, and the differences show. I wouldn't bother playing the sequel.			",128,26,0,9,17,1,7

												DA:O has got to be one of the best RPG's I've played to date. It has an engrossing story, a fleshed out world with interesting and likeable characters. In terms of gameplay it relies on strategic thinking. You can pause in the middle of battle and zoom out into an almost isometric view to get a better look at the battlefield. This allows you to think of where to place your party members and what abilities will work best against a certain enemy. You can even do a cross-class combo, such as having a mage freeze an enemy and then have a warrior bash them with their shield, shattering them thus killing them instantly. But because of this style of play it may not be to everyone's taste. And its does have its fair share of flaws but overall, it is a good game. I really recommand getting it.  ",31,2,0,11,2,0,3

												As in most of the games I play I am very LTTP, but I enjoyed the story lines and world created in this game. While I normally don't play DLC (unless I really enjoyed the main game), I felt like the DLCs in this case built nicely upon what was created in the main game. Dragon Age Awakening was practically a sequel (a short one, but a lot of stand alone games are around the same length).I hate to compare it to Mass Effect, but I am going to anyway. One thing I noticed on my DA play through was I didn't love the characters the same way I loved the ME characters. I didn't make sure I did all the companion quests, etc and didn't even really feel compelled to romance any of the companions. So in a way for me, the story wasn't as character driven as Mass Effect, if that makes sense, but I still found myself enjoying the overall story arc, combat and world.The combat took some getting used to. At first I didn't like the pausing mechanic, but I found later as some of the fights got more complicated in terms of positioning ranged players or having a companion change tactics it made it way more fun. The tactics menu was also an awesome idea. Most of the time I went with the default tactics, but found myself slightly modifying them as I went further into the game. Basically the pausing mechanic and being able to change tactics really added to the game in a big way, setting it apart from other action RPGs.I plan on playing DA2 soon, but I don't own it on Steam unfortunately.

Just describing it makes me want to fire it up again.The setting and tone is similar to Game of Thrones, but before the show even existed; A dark fantasy that delves into intrigue, mystery, deception and tragedy. Not to mention a heavy dose of epic adventure. Of course the game doesn't always take itself so seriously, taking cues from its predecessor by implementing some charming, quirky characters and an overall sense of hope in the darkness. The consistenly excellent writing, VO and art design all come together in a way that helps you get lost in the universe they created.The story, and how it unfolds, is really quite good.

												Easily the best RPG I've ever played. In fact, as of the writing of this review, I'd go as far as to call this the single greatest game I've played on any platform - and that's coming from someone who's been gaming since Atari.Dragon age is a powerful, engrossing experience. The world is massive, the back-story immense. If lore is your thing, you'll find scattered throughout Ferelden enough lore to fill 9 novels. The characters are EASILY the best developed I've ever encountered. Spend enough time playing and you really feel like you connect with them. They have so much personality; and their voice acting is flawless. It really makes you care about them. The combat is polished and perfect for PC (if you played on console and were frustrated, it's not even REMOTELY equivalent. Being able to lay out all your attacks and click the ones you want is much more natural) - lots of strategy and customization options. Perhaps best of all is the story. I've never played a game that's done a better job of presenting the player with choices that will truly alter the story on the fly. This gives it IMMENSE replay value. I've played through this game a dozen times, and it was wildly different every time.If you've grown disenchanted with the increasingly j-pop influenced Final Fantasy series, try Dragon Age			",679,203,26,81,61,11,129

												Finally after many years I managed to complete this gameDragon Age is deffinitely my favourite RPG series. Despite the fact I played them in the wrong order I didn't get too many spoilers because they are only softly connected to each other with storyline.Graphic on full details looks good but its pretty buggy, especially when you get to the city, which forces you to play on combination of low and medium details.Storyline is pretty interesting and easy to follow to. Sidequests are good too, you can make your gameplay easier by doing them. Combat mechanics are simple and doesn't require you to spend few hours on learning what's what.And my favourite thing, character creation. The character creator gives you possibility to make your character look the way you want (or at least close to it because its still one of earlier versions of creators)Its a game I can fully recomment to all RPG lovers			",71,4,0,24,11,0,12

												This is THE MOST amazing game. I don't much like strategy, but I can't imagine this game without the strategy side of it. The characters have depth and personality that makes them feel real; I am crazy attached to quite a few. The humor in it had me smirking and occasionally laughing out loud, and yes there are dramatic moments... but they're not overplayed or drawn out. They're what you would expect, but better.

												Dragon Age: Origins sets itself apart from other games of it's genre.  The story is phenomenal to say the least, the characters are some of the deepest, well-thought figures in any game I've ever played, and the RPG element allows the player direct decisions on nearly every aspect of the game.  When 'epic, fantasy RPG' comes to mind, DA:O is truly the elite in it's class.  The Ultimate Edition is no exception, great price for value.I'm a long time console player with probably several hundred hours and atleast 5 playthroughs, but I have yet to complete my first playthrough of the game and all the DLC on the PC yet and already have 80+ hours logged.  You heard correctly; 80+ hours on one character and I've only completed the base game, Warden's Peak, Stone Prisoner, and Golem's of Amgarrak.  I have yet to complete Awakening, Witch Hunt, Leliana's Song, and Darkspawn Invasion.  I expect the total hours to be 120+ on one character by the time I have done everything the Ultimate Edition has to offer.  Easily one of the best values for dollar per hour spent.The combat may be the only draw-back to the game.  Strategy-wise, it's extremely in-depth and requires much preparation on higher difficulties.  Veteran MMO players will feel right at home.  However the visuals are lacking (keeping in mind the date of release) and the whole system isn't very 'exhilarating', though you'll feel the occasional rush during a boss fight.  The combat serves its purpose and doesn't really throw any curves; it doesn't add much noteworthy additions to the game, but it certainly does not detract from the piece.The vanilla game is stellar in itself, but the incorporation of the DA Updater allows easy organization of mods.  Mods I've found especially good include textures, re-skins, graphics, combat AI, and combat tactics.Overall, one of the best modern RPG's in existence.  Give it a shot if you haven't, you won't regret it.10/10			",27,2,0,6,5,0,22

												You don't have this? GO BUY IT! I loved playing this game, Bioware managed to do a pretty good job with Dragon Age, even more than Mass Effect in my honest opinion. The story explains very well what is happening in the game world without anything sounding ""awkward"". The story is one of the best I've experienced lately but it kinda feels they are doing the same they did with Mass Effect, a special organization (Specters/Grey Wardens) fighting to save the day from evil (Reapers/DarkSpawn). But in the end, I enjoyed it very much. The combat handles pretty well and it feels solid, at first I didn't really liked it but after a while I got used to it and now, I adore it. The skill tree and the ammount of options you have that will affect how the game unfolds are surprisingly very good. I wouldn't say the looting system is the best, it's certainly mediocre. With tons of crafting along with runecrafting that there's in the game and the small but good amount of content that Awakening brings into the base game I'd say that this were around 99 hours very well spent and I recommend this RPG to anyone that loves a good story, a good fantasy world and a good experience.

												This game is a masterpiece when it comes to videogames. It pairs challenging tactical battles with excellent plot and an interesting setting. The graphics are good for such a large open game during the time it was made and even if they aren't as amazing as current days, it does not subtract from it. What I found to be the best part about this game was that each battle I had to fight differently. Each one had the possibility of defeat, and their were rarely any easy battles that I didn't have to think while fighting. Also, story wise, the greatest part in my opinion were the characters. I did not dislike a single one of them, and they each one of them I related and cared about. Overall this game is one of the greatest RPG games I have ever played, and if you enjoy RPGs and haven't picked this up, do so now.			",79,16,0,36,6,0,13

												One of the greates RPG ever. I totally love this game. I played it like 4 times and its not enough. Awesome storyline where you interrupt by making your decision. Battling equal and sometimes hard. Like sometimes I had to low my difficulty to easy. However, that was beacuse I wasnt quite strategic person. So yea, if you like to make your strategies and trying something new, this is the game for you. And also.. I totally loved romance stories altought I always played woman so I tried only romance with Alistair, Zevran and Leilana. They were just sweet. Very well.. You have to give it a try! Also with all DLC.. I havent finished all of them yet but they are pretty cool. ;)			",20,22,1,6,6,0,2

												So I know that Steam says I've played only 91.3hrs, but I've played offline as well, and it's a total of about 125+ hours. I ADORE this game. It is absolutely worth it to buy the Ultimate Edition-however, I bought it on sale for $7.40 (midweek madness is GODSEND). The extra content is very useful (there's items, gifts and and even 2 map locations, as well as an additional party member) and the additional campaigns are very fun.The story is very well developed, as are the characters. They're very vivid. The graphics are also fabulous. What I love the most about the story is how OPTIONAL it is; you can skip cutscenes by pressing escape, as well as dialogue. Much of the story comes from talking to NPC's as well as your party members, so if you are not a fan of story and are just there for the gameplay, you can easily skip it and go about your business.The gameplay itself can be tricky for those not familiar with the tactics system. I played Final Fantasy 12 and there they called it ""gambit"" system, where basically you can set up a list of tasks for each character to go through during a battle, which makes more strategy possible. However, unlike Final Fantasy 12's gambit system, selecting a character will prevent them from going through their tactics; they will only perform those tasks automatically if you're NOT using them. But if you don't want to set up each individual task, or aren't sure what you'll need, you can select from the premade tactics.Also, an important note: leveling up can be difficult because monsters don't respawn. For this reason, I recommend exploring as much as you can and completing a few side quests. There's tons of side quests available in almost every town you visit.The exploration CAN be a little linear, though. For example, you are unable to jump over objects or vault from cliffs (that was fun in Fable 2). Plus, when traveling from town to town, you go to a loading screen, and observe the map as you travel. There are random encounters that can occur, but it's definitely not as free exploration like Skyrim or Oblivion.All in all, this game is a lot of fun, and it just draws you in. I am very glad I purchased it. I tell all of my friends to buy this game because it's so incredible :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Dragon Age series(yes, that includes DA2) is my favorite RPG game series of all time. I highly recommend this game if you enjoyed Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Night or the Mass effect series.Story is well-written and the characters are the reason that I keep replaying this game. The lore of this game is huge and always interesting to read.The music is beautiful and Aubrey Ashburn has a beautiful voice. The Voice acting is top-notch as well.The combat is tactic-based with some micromanaging but that depends on the difficulty you are playing. You don't have to use tactics, but it will make the gameplay a breeze to play. If you don't like the speed of the combat, there is mod to speed it up. There is also a website full of Dragon Age mods. I highly recommend playing the game vanilla mode, however.The graphics are okay. But don't let it color your choice of purchasing this amazing game.Anyways, I highly recommend buying this game and giving it a chance.			",19,8,0,9,2,0,0

												This game has everything you could possibly wish for in an RPG : tactical challenging and fun combat, classes and skills well designed, beautiful world and deep lore, great story, excellent companions, deep and meaningful choices and dialogue, funny stuff and in the same time things that will make you sad, good loot and crafting systems. I refuse to think there is someone who really loves good games and wouldnt want to play it. I might need to warn you though that you WILL need dozens of hours to finish a playthrough, so it is not really suited for casual gamers. But you WILL love almost every minute of it.

												What can I say, this game is one of my favorite games of all time. Story top notch, amazingly developed charecters, with tones of witty banter. Lore very fleshed out, if you bother to read the codex it does a really good job of explaining why things are the way they are. Also the enviroments are wonderfully degsigned, even if they arnt on top notch graphics they still invoke your imgination and look very interesting and pretty.            However the combat is alright not the best, think of it as playing WoW, click a hot key watch them do the move. However this does allow for some interesting tactical fights, as you pause chose where each of your four man team go and what moves they use then. The only other negative I can levy at this game, as I stated before, is its graphics. They are very ugly even for when it was realesed, low res textures everywhere. But in my book graphics dont make a game, its the story. This is a RPG after all where story comes first.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game. Is. Amazing. There's nothing more to be said about it. There's 0 reason to not own this game if you like RPGs of any kind. Especially since it's $7 right now for the main game and ALL of the DLC? GET IT! I still have this game on ps3. I bought it back in the day when it came out. I re bought it for DLC. I wont talk about or ruin the story for anyone, but it is by far one of the best stories in gaming. The fight at the end made me cry. I cant recall a single other game that was powerfull enough to bring a tear to my eyes. The bonds you make with the members of your party is absolutely amazing. They feel like genuine real life flesh and blood people as you listen to their stories about their life. There's no other word for it. ""Amazing "". On top of all that, there's remarkable replayability as you can choose several different origins that change the story up immensely. And each of the story lines has one of two factons you can side with, which will immediately make you want to replay through it and see what happens on the other side. As soon as you finish this game if you agreed to morigans deal ( which I wont spoil ) you will IMMEDIATELY want to play the witch hunt dlc. And all of this, this is just the MAIN game. Theres so much content here it almost makes up a second whole new game. I can not praise this game high enough, it's in my top 5 games of all time, i've clocked countless hours on this on PS3, pick this up. 10/10.			",25,2,0,8,0,0,6

												I've put hundreds of hours into this game previously on the Xbox 360. While I enjoyed relaxing back and playing with a controller, there's definitely a huge appeal to playing this game on PC. Mods do a great deal to enhance and already fantastic game. Origins is an RPG, having lore with depth, characters with layers that you peel off over time, and a slightly clunky, but fun, combat system. It can feel a little slow paced at times, but it's worth getting through the more tedious parts for the reward of seeing the relationships that unfold and how your actions alter the course of the events that take place. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for hours of entertainment and a new world to become engrossed in.			",59,12,0,10,7,0,5

And every time I hear Dragon Age Origins music I get emotional.Pros:-Great story-So many options, and they do affect the outcome-Beautifully written characters and lore-Wonderful landscapesCons:-Combat can get grindy-Your emotions will die-There are some bugsLove RPGs? You'll love this! Love games with heaps of story? You'll love this!My steam account is lying, I've played many more hours than this- but it worked better for me on Origin than Steam, as Steam didn't load the DLCs for some reason.I love this game so much, and yet I also hate the people that made it.. for putting me thorugh so much emotional termoil! Ah well, all in all I guess there're ok people.. since I did get to enjoy myself for many hours! :PI love this game and the characters so much. <3 (ok, ok, I do hate some of them, which is understandable!)10/10 Would play this game and cry through it again			",47,7,0,11,1,0,2

												Massive in scope, with a highly developed universe, great characters, humor, terror, mystery, and the opportunity to shape a character along the lines of your own preferences, this game is a must-play.And it's not a game you can ""sleep"" through. You will definitely be challenged in combat, and resources are finite. In fact, resources are so finite that I was caught off guard. I'm used to JRPGs and open-world games where you can always find a way to ""buy more supplies."" In this title, you'd better have some resource-management skills, or you will not be happy (especially when it's early in the game).My advice is to set the difficulty to where the game feels a touch easy (things will get plenty hard as the story progresses), and then settle in for a long, fun, rich ride.

												Here it is, the first game in the Dragon Age franchise. It's probably been said enough times by now that it doesn't require me to repeat this, but I strongly believe it bears repeating. Dragon Age Origins is one of the best role playing games of all time! If you have the faintest interest in playing this phenomenal medieval fantasy RPG you should do so without a moment's hesitation. There is so much content waiting for you here that it's actually impossible to cover all of it without turning this review into an essay. Quite frankly the most compelling aspect of DA:O and what makes it such a great game, where even after playing through the entire story for the 2nd or 5th time, you can still come back to it having just as much fun and be as engaged as the first time playing it.From my own experience this game should be played with as little knowledge as possible. That way you have the opportunity of getting as much out of DA:O as you can, and believe me when I say there is a lot of cool stuff that awaits you. There is such a rich open world for you to discover and be apart of, like the fascinating story involving The Great Wardens and impending Blight, not to mention your own story depending on the race and class you choose. All the memorable characters you encounter, who are all so well-written and might be the best aspect of the game, I mean the banter between the party members always get a chuckle out of me. They all have different personalities, which means they all react differently to your decisions and they all come equipped with their own talents and specializations.Combat is an important part of the gameplay, this is where people might have mixed feelings about DA:O since this is pretty much a tactical game and it requires the player to be very strategic with their enemy encounters. However, this is not something to worry about since I think this is one of better and more accessible challenging games you can ever play. It's easy to understand even if you aren't familiar with this style of gameplay, but it does require you to learn and adapt your party members tactics. It also helps that you assess the situation by pausing anytime during combat.Overall, this is an amazing gaming experience and I suggest giving Dragon Age Origins a chance, because this is truly an epic adventure you don't want to miss out on. A game I will personally keep coming back to for years to come!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hi, do you like the Baldur's Gate series? What about Planescape: Torment? Icewind Dale? Mass effect with swords and deeper character interaction? Dragon Age: Origins was made by BioWare, the makers of Baldur's Gate, to be the spiritual successor to that very same Baldur's Gate. Imagine that! Spoiler Alert: They succeeded with that.  While not without it's minor flaws, Dragon Age: Origins has the deepest dialogue and interaction with NPC party members since... well, Baldur's Gate. It's not *as* deep as Baldur's Gate or Torment, but it is certainly deeper than Mass Effect. Anyone who enjoyed any of those games should play this. Oh, and don't play Dragon Age 2. It's crap, and was really dumbed down to be a straight console game rather than a PC RPG ported to console. It's really dull, so unless that's your thing just pass on the sequel.

												This is less a review of Origins by itself, and more a review of the Dragon age Series as a whole.  Heavily opinionated and spoilers ahead, so be warned.If you like D&D style fights with an element of chance, and overcoming pitted battles with a tactical mindset, then Dragon Age: Origins is for you.  There are a few exploits here and there, but this game glitters like a ruby among RPGs released within the last few years.  I Just wish Inquisition was available through steam.  (And that it was more like DA:O.  It's got the hallmark sins of modern RPGs being too damn flashy.  This is supposed to be a Western RPG series, not a JRPG series.)And don't waste your energy on DA2.  It's a mess.  Watch a playthrough instead, you will get to experience a decent story without having to sit through gameplay that's trash comppared to DA:O.All top-down tactical RPGs should emulate Origins, I hope the next Dragon Age game takes cues from the Witcher and backs off from the cartoony flashy power activation nonsense that belongs in WoW and JRPGs. The series needs to get back in touch with its dark fantasy roots. I don't care if people think its gross or offensive.  Don't let trying to be politically correct limit you creatively  Perfectionism is the enemy of creativity, and trying to make a perfect game that pleases everyone will just land you with something dull and fangless.The Darkspawn in Inquisition were like boring zombies...While the Darkspawn in THIS game are like horrible scabby mutants with mouths full of corroded pointy snake teeth.  Their faces permanently twisted into manic grins of madness, gibbering in their gutteral and violent tongue.You're doing something wrong when your race of subterranean♥♥♥♥♥♥orcs comes off as boring and inoffensive.  They NEED to be disgusting, they NEED to be cruel in order for a player to feel invested in going in and seeking every little pocket of darkspawn lurking in the shadows.  Each kill is a small victory, each Hurlocke beheaded is a dwarven woman that doesn't need to suffer mutation and mutilation at the hands of darkspawn captors, each Ogre slaughtered is a caravan of soldiers that gets to go home to their families alive and not in boxes of bloodied paste.Recapture 30% of that, and Dragon age 4 will be a hit.

Very quick review:Well worth the money for a memorable RPG that can be played in so many ways. Fulfilling, funny, and completely engaging from start to finish. Minor flaws are forgivable and ignorable for the most part. Absolutely brilliant.Slightly less quick review:Pros:+ Overall gameplay is fantastic – flaws are not overly bothersome.+ Main storyline is excellent – very satisfying and great value for money in terms of length, involvement, and balance of fetch-type quests vs more intricate jobs.+ Side quests are interesting and don’t feel like chores.+ Character development is perfect – you’ll want to do those side quests!+ Customisation: great choice of unique starting points and character builds makes for unrivalled replay value.+ Incredible writing. Draws you in from the very start with whichever character build and story you’ve chosen and is genuinely hilarious at times.+ Voice acting is fantastic.+ Well-developed and immersive world build and lore, but not boring.+ Decisions actually matter.+ Great soundtrack.+ Good mod support.Cons: - Graphics are a bit outdated – high settings or a couple of mods can help, but it’s not horrendous.- Combat mechanics aren’t perfect – a bit slow at times and it takes some getting used to.- You might cry a bit.- You might also laugh till you pee a little. Down to business:Just as a starter, I adore this game. It’s one of my all-time favourites. The DA franchise is amazing, and although Origins is no spring chicken, it has aged well. On higher settings the game still has spectacular moments, graphically speaking, and the mid-low range settings are playable and artistically enjoyable, although not the best by any means. But you won’t care. At all.If you’re looking for an entertaining, fulfilling, thoroughly immersive RPG with brilliant writing and touching character development, grab this. As someone who has also read the Dragon Age novels because she was desperate for more, I can tell you the world build is incredible – the lore is well structured, believable, and gripping. But for those of you who don’t want to read codex or journal entries, with this, you really don’t need to – you’ll be drawn in by the game itself, which expertly takes you through a robust storyline and gives you just the right amount of info to keep you interested without being boring or overwhelming.Your companions will give you feels. Some you’ll hate, some will make you laugh, and some you’ll go full Hulk mode to protect.As far as mechanics go, it’s not perfect – combat is a little slow and clunky at times, and it can take a little while to get used to. The multitude of tactical options and talent customisations available may be a little overwhelming to start with, especially if you’re not used to RPG builds. However, this is more than compensated for. Put simply, you can play whichever way you want. If you enjoy micromanaging and tactical play, the game deals very well with this. If you’d rather be more hands-on, or a mixture of both, go ahead – the AI is pretty good at letting your party get on with it while you smash some darkspawn skulls in with a sword as long as your own body, or go full mage-rage and burn someone to a crisp. As for your actual character – the game does the (mostly) silent protagonist thing very well. It takes nothing away from the enjoyment of this game. The voice acting as a whole is excellent – very believable, very natural, and the right amount of comic relief vs. dramatic, feel-inducing bits. It’s all very epic but not over-acted.The story customisation is second to none. At the start of the game, you can build your male or female character from scratch (or just use the presets) – human, elf, or dwarf; warrior, rogue or mage; noble or bottom of the pile - these options DO make a huge difference to the story. Replay value is amazing. You basically have multiple different games, and the choices you make as you progress shape the world around you as you deal with the Blight. As far as DLC goes, Awakening is brilliant. You can take your story and character forward from the ending of Origins itself, or you can create another new one! It’s another good chunk of gameplay, with fantastic characters and plenty more to do. The other extras are great value too – not to spoil anything, they’re perfect for those wanting a little more from certain characters, and are well worth the play time. Moving forward to DA:2, you can take your Origins story along with you – yay for transferrable save files! Or you can custom-build a story if you weren’t exactly happy with your Origins playthrough and can’t be arsed to do another one. What more could you want?Overall, DA:O is one of the best RPGs I’ve played to date. The characters, the world, and the general gameplay are too much fun to be dented by the flaws in mechanics. It’s something I will happily replay over and over again.			",83,13,0,16,7,0,1

												Dragon Age: Origins is a great game, and the Ultimate Edition is the way to go as it includes every single piece of DLC released for the game. Everybody raves about this game, but rarely are the shortcomings addressed:- Animations are dull and stiff (during both combat and dialogue)- Character models have only a few different variations, (so you'll see the same haircuts etc. over and over again) - The overall story arc is rather generic, (hey, you're the hero, go collect everyone and prepare for a final battle)- Depending on what classes you play as, combat can be mind numbingly slow and weak (in particular for any ranged spec rogue, or sword/shield spec warrior)- The world is kind of presented in a rather dull manner- Several bugs (lots of crashing in Origins, and many other technical ones in Awakening)Most of these issues can be ignored because of the other great content in the game. There are some intriguing side quests, interesting companion characters, tough decisions, there's loads replayability and the lore is really deep and well written. For me personally, most of the issues are fixed in Dragon Age II (though that game also brings forward some new issues...)Overall, it's still a great game, I'd give it a flat 8.0/10. But again, for all the praise it gets, it's flaws are never talked about.			",110,27,2,7,1,0,5

												Grab your sword and shield because we're going on an adventure, First stop, Being born. Then we're off to fight rats in the kitchen, find your trusty mutt who turns out to be smarter than everyone else in the kingdom, seduce a visiting princess and head to bed where you're awoken by a siege to your castle. The rest of the game is a trudge across a wonderfully bland landscape dotted here and there by complete nonsense quests like Explore the dangerous swamp until you meet a sexy teenage witch who doesn't turn you into a frog. Kill ten gnolls along the way.Racist stereotypes abound, as the only intentionally attractive male character has blonde hair and blue eyes and casts snarky comments the entire adventure, and you're introduced to the party's only black character by finding him naked, shackled in a cage and saying he belongs there. You have the option to free him and bring him as a servant if you go through a complicated back'n'forth with the village leader, who hates dark skin. But in all seriousness this game is pretty chill, it's a 100+ hour modern day Baldur's Gate with decent characters, so if you're looking for another Baldur's Gate fix and don't have ADD you should consider this.Mods that are must haves:Advanced TacticsCharacter Respec ModDetailed TooltipsMadd Gift Guide + AwakeningMorrigan 3.3 and Leliana 2.8 (their default faces are fugly)No Helmet Hack + Awakening (not a single good looking helm in this game)Pretty Faces (NPC faces are fugly)Skip the Fade Manual (don't even question this, this lets you skip the ♥♥♥♥♥iest part of the game)Storage Chest (an official mod by a dev, that wasn't but into the game...)Unlock 25 Tactic Slots Extendedv2 No more Snarling (shuts that damn dog up at the camp)			",1666,682,61,226,179,19,307

												Crashes and Freezes abound in this game. I remember having problems when originally trying to play the game in 2009 and for some reason it's worse with modern day (2014) hardware.That aside, DA is a classic. A quick history: BioWare originally gained fame by creating isometric tactical RPGs in the Dungeons and Dragons (Forgotten Realms) setting. I never looked this up, but my guess is that some suit at Hasbro wasn't able to continue that relationship with BioWare (and ultimately Electronic Arts) and so they created their own setting to create a franchise around at or around which became the Dragon Age universe.In contrast to the High Fantasy themes of Forgotten Realms, the campaign setting of Dragon Age is more Low Fantasy or Dark Fantasy. Magic is to be feared, the mood is dark and gritty, you are surrounded by despair and (to some degree) magic items are a little rare. Also in contrast to any D&D setting, characters do not seem to have direct relationships with gods (or Gods) and do not attain magical powers (i.e. healing) from them. In other words, there are healing schools in magic and no clerics.Differences in the campaign aside, DA is EXACTLY what you would expect from a BioWare game. You have exactly the same viewpoint and controls as seen in Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, and Neverwinter. Interactions with NPCs and companions is exactly as you would see in Mass Effect (which is the natural extension of the previously mentioned games).Lots of replay value is inherent with the different starting areas, different ways in which to approach quests and companions and multiple side quests. However, not NEARLY as much open endness within the world if you are to compare to a Bethesda, Elder Scrolls game. Multiple mods exist to enhance the game as well (check Nexus Mods)DA is a classic RPG. Whether you like it or not, however, depends on your style of RPG. Obviously it's a single player game. It's not a JRPG. It's not as open as Elder Scrolls. Tactics are of moderate importance within encounters. Lots of scripted (voice acted) dialogue with NPCs with 'some' variation, but in the end moderately rail-roaded.			",126,17,0,39,8,0,14

												Dragon Age Origins: Ultimate EditionPositives:+ This game is a tactical based RPG, requiring frequent pauses in combat to issue party orders. Each class has unique strengths and weaknesses, mages, rogues and warriors alike all contribute something special to the battles. The game itself is very challenging but satisfying and fun at the same time.+ Rogues can learn the art of dual wielding and typically fit in as party DPSER, while Mages have access to a plethora of spells, from aoe and single target disables, to healing, revivals, nuke damage and more. Warriors can inflict savage damage with two handed weapons or tank enemies with a shield and armour.+ The dialogue and story in Dragons Age Origins: Ultimate Edition is amazing. Bioware are well known for their fantastic storytelling and this game is no exception. There are memorable characters who you can build friendships with and complete quests for. Romance is also an option. The main plot is well thought-out and maintains your interest. +There's a large number of side quests to complete, around 120 hours of content in total with the expansions. Plenty of moral decision making which impacts on the story progression too.+ Lots of random event encounters, with forests, temples and ancient ruins to explore, along with several cities.Mixed:~ For 2009 the graphics are not the best, but by no means are they terrible. This is definitely no reason to avoid the game.Negatives:- Some redundant skills, like trap making or survival, that don't seem to serve any useful purpose.Overall Score 9/10Dragons Age Origins: Ultimate Edition is a really solid game in pretty much every respect. Well worth purchasing on sale for $10 or less. In fact, many digital distributors are offering this price daily, so don't miss out.			",66,3,0,9,2,0,8

												A Masterpiece game, that is made by a great company in Bioware. Story is always interesting, allowing you to pick your own character race and each one has their own back story. Like playing as a Human Noble, City Elf, Circle Mage, etc. Gameplay is great, with great use of a tactical system and dialogue in-game provides great fun. Graphics are great, with blood and gore. Presentation is like a story book style, and everything is easy to use. Sound in the game is great with amazing atmospheric music, and voice overs are well done. Although, it can be a bit on the low volume, so you might have to crank your volume up more than usual to hear. Also, some DLCs have come out for it to enhance the story even more. Overall, a masterpiece game. I don't remember another RPG like it, maybe except Neverwinter Nights 1			",904,197,17,59,57,3,87

												One of the best RPG game even now, spend alot of time on one character and still have worth replaying a few more times as different classes & making different decisions. Still better than most RPG games that came out recently. This game should be used as a staple of how to make RPG games. The story is just fantastic. 10/10			",138,13,0,13,12,0,12

												Recommended, but only with reservations.It doesn't run completely stable. I've had it crash several times when opening the party's inventory screen directly after a larger fight in the city of Denerim. Other players have had similar crashes years ago already. The Wiki mentions various bugs in quests and other parts of the game.The game's playtime is long enough, if it's your first playthrough without following any guides/walkthroughs. If you want to rush through the game a single time, note that some guides are controversial.The game's is easy enough at ""Normal"" difficulty, and even more so, if you don't mind reloading an older save from time to time. Such as when you've found out something that's not explained in the manual.The included manual only gives a very sketchy picture of how everything works. Don't expect to find any maths in there. Searching the Wiki and discussion forums will be needed, if you're interested in details, such as how exactly an attribute influences a skill's efficiency.Combat is very repetitive, especially since the party's size is limited to your player character and only three NPC companions, which you control. Companions, which you remove from the party, remain available at the party's camp site till the end of the game. I think the skill/talent tree has been dumbed down pretty much. The variety of enemies could be much greater.It is not an open world. Quest locations on the overview map get added/removed as you progress through the game. The quest areas themselves often are very restricted, and even in the wilderness you can only move through an area on predefined paths and not move freely.In some parts of the game you enter meta-gaming hell. Such as an ambiguous answer during conversation leading to an immediate and unexpected ambush of a potential companion, because that's how some of the conversation trees have been designed. Reload and avoid the WTF-moment. Or one of your long-time companions, who has been with you almost since the beginning and  calls you a friend, leaves permanently before the last few endgame fights just because the game only offers two story-driven choices for taking either the evil or good path. Or merchants at various stages of the game, who offer unlimited supplies of some very important crafting materials or a recipe you need. Once you've gained such meta-gaming knowledge, the real planning can start. Or else the potential for multiple playthroughs would be low.If you only want to do a single playthrough, the game is entertaining enough for sure. Its beginning varies in quality. Don't quit in rage early. The middle and end are better. The voice acting is fine, but sometimes a bit silly (they couldn't resist adding crap when you select a companion). And there are lots of cutscenes that add to the atmosphere.			",3,2,0,9,0,0,0

												I have played this game over and over and over again into oblivion. I absolutely love this game. The setting is dark and dire. The characters are memorable and actually make you care for them, especially your companions. This was another series that suffered from sequelitis. The first game was far superior to the second game. I cannot say enough praise about this game. The expansion wasn't quite up to the greatness of the main game itself, but it is decent in its own right. Please play this game, play all the DLC. This is an instant classic.			",42,2,0,9,2,0,6

												I got this 'Ultimate Edition' for £5... Possibly the best money I have ever spent!I have around 26 hours on record so far and have not even scratched the surface. I had played Dragon Age 2 on console and no idea that this bargain would be by far superior to it's sequel. Depth, lots and lots of depth. Voice acting, for the most part, is superb. Every companion has bags of personality (for better or worse), the storyline is gripping without making you feel like you should rush through the main quests, environments have obviously been lovingly created to the point where it feels like you're in a world that's had as much TLC as one created by Tolkien himself.All of this and I'm 13% of the way to completing the game... It's going to be a good ride :) MUST BUY!			",21,0,0,4,4,0,5

												Really great game. Long story line with side quests to spice things up when you want to vary from the main line adds to the experience. Character customization leaves a little to be desired in the way of abilities, but the creation screen isn't bad and bearable for a single player game. The romance options add an extra twist too and it's so great that your decisions almost always affect the game in some way. I'd recommend this to anyone that likes long rpg's. As a bonus the Ultimate Edition includes all the premium content and extra compaigns that add to the original storyline and also are great stories in themselves.			",46,10,0,28,6,0,15

												An amazing tactical RPG. Still holds up to scrutiny after all this time.I've just bought it a second time, just to have on my steamlist - it's that good.If you're new to the series, give the second game a miss unless it's going cheap...As with the Mass Effect games, EA pushed for a more action, less RPG and less tactics based game... to it's detriment.I've read that the devs are making the next DA game to be allot closer to the original. Which can only be a good thing.The Ultimate edition is great value, it packs some great DLC - Awakening - with some content packs that were not great value when they were released stand-alone. As a whole pack though, I'd definately recommend teh ultimate edition over the main game on it's own.			",224,52,1,40,7,0,32

You actually have to use tactics and correct positioning to succeed which really makes the environment you fight in extremely important (leeroy jenkins tatics do not apply).  Lots of customization in terms of character abilities (multiple advanced classes to choose from) and armors/weapons to wear.  You can also change up your team compisition to create new and exciting gameplay options.  The story is not the greatest but does feel epic at times, the gameplay is what makes this game so good.

												If Bioware have proven anything it's that they can make excellent RPGs, and Dragon Age: Origins is definitely one of their good ones. It's well put together with a variety of beginnings depending on your characters race and background, and contains a great group of well rounded characters that add a lot of depth to the game, as well as a generous amount of humerous banter. The story line is engaging and along with a dramatic soundtrack create a very imersive experience. The multiple beginnings add to the excitement of replaying the game, as every one offers a slightly different experience.Overall a decent RPG, definitely worth playing.			",32,22,0,20,7,0,2

												Dragon Age: Origins is a massive fantasy rpg that is bound to suck you in with its amazing story and complex characters. Bioware really hit it out of the park with this one. If you have played games made by Bioware in the past, Mass Effect and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. You will feel right at home here. Dragon Age will have your heart and make you care for the world and everything within. The game truly makes you believe all of your decions matter and you're making a big difference. Before you even begin the game you will be prompted to pick and choose your race (Human, Dwarf or Elf) with each one having their own unique starting adventure. The game also does a nice job of giving you special dialouge options depending on your race. With so many possible paths you can take in the game, the replayability is through the roof. In my opinion, where Bioware absolutely slam dunked, Morrigan! The romance options in this game was the icing on the cake for me. Never have i ever seen it done more masterfully. At one point, i had to set the game down for a little bit and seriously ponder just which female follower i wanted to pursue a reltionship with. If you have never had the chance to play this game, i highly recommend it.

												DA: Origins won me over with the different introductions for each of the classes and the way you are treated depending on your origin story throught the game. The atmosphere is great, character interaction is superb and the story makes you want to progress. It can get a bit 'samey' from time to time but this game is a true gem and takes me back to the glory days of isometric RPG's. Not to mention the game is good to look at and runs on mid range hardware without a problem.   I was pleasantly suprised at how well balanced the combat and levelling systems were. I got a real kick out of playing the mage, no 1 spell overwhelmed all enemies in a single casting which kept the magic system interesting. I'll generally play warrior classes in RPG's, the reason being is in the late game combat usually presents a more of a challenge for fighters over spell casters that can blast or summon their way to easy victories. However, in DA:O if you didn't tactically use you mage and support charaters there is a real danger of losing story significant battles, it's almost a shame that you're forced to reload it would have been nice to see a consequence. I highly recommend this game and you'll really miss the care and true attention to detail this game has, should you play the sequel.			",353,105,5,46,33,0,58

												A great RPG that I would defintely recommend. The storyline starts off different depending on what race and background you choose but eventually it all comes together. There will be little differences here and there depending on what you choose as well, sometimes in choices you make and other times in the dialogue between characters. The fighting can be interesting especially as a mage because you can combine spells and have different effects. For example, putting down grease and using a flame spell to create a giant grease fire. You can also build relationships with your companions and romance one or more. Many of the choices you make will carry on and have some sort of effect in the second and third installment of Dragon Age.			",85,68,1,46,21,3,15

												Kind of reminds me of the old Baldurs Gate Series (yeah, I'm THAT old, lol).  It starts slow, but it gets good on into the game.  Haven't finished it yet, but I'm enjoying the ride so far.  As an artist, the dull colors are annoying.  Everyone used to joke about everything in Quake being the same color, its the same idea.  Everything in DAO is a dull shade of either brown or grey, with some red blood splatter for highlights.  Overall, I'd give it a 3.5 stars out of 5, definitely worth playing!			",23,3,0,11,6,0,2

												Dragon Age: Origins stands as one of the most memorable rpg experiences I've ever had. Memorable because it does something that too many games nowadays don't do. It invests you into the story. Your choices influence the way a lot of story elements pan out. Sure the game follows a fairly defined progression but it is your choices that influence the way certain characters react during that progression. And while it might seem trivial, in reading, it can impose a very broad spectrum of emotional connections with the characters in your party. If you haven't played Dragon Age: Origins you're seriously cutting yourself out from a fantastic experience. This is not your generic Jrpg. This is a powerful epic that spins multiple perspectives on race inequality, the meaning of life, the essence of good vs evil in the eternal struggle for moral/ethical definition of a corrupting world, and theological/mystical affluence.Don't deny yourself one of the greatest RPG experiences ever created. Get Dragon Age: Origins as soon as you can and let yourself be moved by a true masterpiece.			",603,124,13,108,47,7,69

												I got this 'Ultimate Edition' for £5... Possibly the best money I have ever spent!I have around 26 hours on record so far and have not even scratched the surface. I had played Dragon Age 2 on console and no idea that this bargain would be by far superior to it's sequel. Depth, lots and lots of depth. Voice acting, for the most part, is superb. Every companion has bags of personality (for better or worse), the storyline is gripping without making you feel like you should rush through the main quests, environments have obviously been lovingly created to the point where it feels like you're in a world that's had as much TLC as one created by Tolkien himself.All of this and I'm 13% of the way to completing the game... It's going to be a good ride :) MUST BUY!			",21,0,0,4,4,0,5

												*possible spoiler alerts!*Dragon Age... Dragon Age... Dragon Age... Where to begin? Well this game was made in 2009 (I think), so giving that it's around 4-5 years old, It's pretty fun to play. The main story is not only vast, but intense as you're protecting the realm, nay the human population from the inevitable Blight as the ever popular hero among the 'Grey Wardens'.The combat system isn't too shabby, and the leveling up system (Skill tree) is pretty neat also. The main thing which does it for me however (like the Mass Effect series), is the dialogue. You can even level up your coercion skill which provides 'intimidate' and 'persuade' options during dialogue cutscenes. Along with the fact that the campaign is amazing, there are HUNDREDS of side quests (as expected) to achieve!Now so far, this review has been based upon 'Dragon Age: Origins', yet I feel I should also take a moment to talk about it's expansion 'Awakening'... Other than additional DLC for this game (Wardens Keep, The Stone Prisoner etc) Dragon Age: Awakening opens up yet another vast campaign which continues from 'Origins'. This places your main character (which can be imported over from a previous save, or created from level 20) into what becomes Vigils Keep, the home of the Grey Wardens. You soon discover that although the Blight has been prevented and the Archdemon killed, Darkspawn are still at large and taking orders from someone, or something...Cutting this review short, whether you buy this game (preferably the Ultimate Edition with all DLCs) in a sale or not, you will not be disappointed.You will however, be disappointed if you play Dragon Age 2, which I will not get started on...Overall, 8-9 / 10!

												I finally decided to give this game a whirl & I'm glad I did.It's tons of fun & there are so many different ways you can play it since the story branches depending on your conversations & choices.You can also enable a developer console to enter console commands by editing C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Dragon Age Ultimate Edition\data\DAOriginsLauncher.xmlJust replace the line<true action=""execute"" file=""${BINARIES_DIR}\DAOrigins.exe"" path=""${BINARIES_DIR}"" autoquit=""true"" />with<true action=""execute"" file=""${BINARIES_DIR}\DAOrigins.exe"" path=""${BINARIES_DIR}"" autoquit=""true"" arguments=""-enabledeveloperconsole"" />___________________________________________________________NOTE: Some guides I found had the arguments=""-enabledeveloperconsole""  before autoquit=""true"", but that didn't work for me.  A guide on steam listed it after and when I tried that it worked.___________________Then edit your Documents\BioWare\Dragon Age\Settings\KeyBindings.iniand change the OpenConsole_0 line to something else, for exampleOpenConsole_0=Keyboard::Button_F7So when you press F7 it will open the developer console.___________________Then you can do all kinds of things with the developer console; like god mode, add any amount of money or skill points, jump to any point in the game, add or remove characters, etc.. There's a list of the commands you can use if you scroll down a bit on the wikihttp://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Console_%28Origins%29#If you do this, make sure to use the mod to make the commands visable while you type them.  It's a lot easier that way.http://www.nexusmods.com/dragonage/mods/1110/ ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're like me and like to complete games in order and are considering playing this before Dragon Age: Inquisition, do it!!!I can't believe how much I loved this game! It may be old and the graphics may show that a little, but surprisingly it does still hold up and is easy to look past. The characters are all amazing, it was painful to have to choose only 3 to follow you each mission, because I wanted to spend time with them all! I felt like the whole world was alive and I was part of it. The combat is pretty challenging, but it's rewarding when you plan out your attacks and powers in the correct combination to interact with each other and cause the maximum damage. This game is so worth playing!			",51,19,0,10,8,2,22

												Possibly the best game I've ever played. It has some bugs so some missions cannot be finished, and the UI and controls take some getting used to, Also, the learning curve is quite steep so you need to level your characters carefully and plan ahead. But the atmosphere more than makes up for any problems/glitches I have found. I have really felt like being part of the story all along the way. The characters and their background stories are great, voice acting is superb (in particular Claudia Black and Geraldine Blecker). And the whole game has an incredible sense of humor: I spent long hours playing the jailbreak scene over and over again to see the various plotlines for that part as well as tried different groups of companions to hear the different ways the characters mock each other.

												Great game series. I enjoyed the hours of gameplay, the depth of story, and also complexity of the overall mythos of Dragon Age and all its DLC. This game had just the right blend of character, fighting, class systems, story, and humor. On top of your own storyline, there are plenty of characters peppered into your party that have their own storys and quests that you may pursue if you like. As with any good RPG, you get complete control of your characters background, apperance, and fighting style. I played through the first half of the game 3 times before I finally settled on an female elf rogue build. The quests are pretty straight forward in most cases, nothing incredibly challening or puzzling...but the fights are brutal. Unless you play on easy, be prepared to die a lot. Not a problem really when you can pretty much save game whenever you like. I've always liked the combat pause function in games like SW:KOTL and again it works well here giving your party time to plan its next spell or attack. The combat itself is varied, and there are quite a few different builds you can acheive with race, class, and specializations. The spell system is follows suite, its diverse and rife with ways to achieve mage dominance. Only downfall for me was a few crashes when the spells and fighting really got hectic. I attribute it to my lack of resources on my PC, but was still frustrating enough it bears mentioning. 9 out 10. Fun to play, hours of content.			",81,4,1,15,8,2,20

												Overall, Dragon Age: Origins is a very diverse game. After completing my first playthough in around 60 hours, I began my second run through the game, and had a completely different experience.

												Originally bought this game for PS3 when it came out and played it ALOT so the hours i sank into it don't match up in Steam.I bought it because of the epic CGI trailers that spawned in between TV commercials (weird that they aren't on the store page) and bought it in a whimp without knowing what i was getting myself into. So, when i started playing i was like ""WTF is this ****""? ugly graphics (compared to it's trailer counterpart that is) and weird gameplay (didn't check the box for info. I just dived into it). But i kept going because of the story and setting. I literally played hours smashing buttons when i was in battle and thinking what crappy unresponsive combat it was :DAfter +- 3 hours i noticed you had to trigger combat by pressing a button ""ones"" (auto-attack) and select the appropriate skills when needed. I was like ""mehh"" and yet i still kept playing and then it slowly started to grow on me. When i was like half-game i was addicted! I couldn't stop playing (micro managing tougher battles! hell yeah!) and days turned into nights in a heartbeat! What voodoo trickery is this! So yeah, it was hard getting into it mainly because of the visual aspect and there's not really an in-game explenation of the batlle system (for as far as i know i had to figure it all out by myself and not being into Tactical RPG it took a long time), but story, gameplay and setting (medieval fantasy) made me forget that. And best of all... some characters you meet in this game are so loveable and if not worst; are truely missed in the next installments (besides some small cameo's) :( This game got me truely into RPG games (if you don't count ""Wonder Boy In Monsterworld"" xD )Bought it again for PC so i can mod it!Dragon Age: Origins get's 10 hearts!*crappy review i know :p			",27,7,1,7,1,0,0

												The Story: It is amazing for this game. Well thought and well Detailed. Spread over the whole map. The main story line is amazing it drags you in from the get go. Straight to the end of the game. The side quests are great to again all over the map. Certainly gives you that extra bit to work on even if it only gives a little extra bit of game play. Even with character stories to. Some meld together. Even the interaction talks while wondering about. It all works together perfectly.The Detail: Tones in my book. Just perfect for a long RPG. Which is what it should be. Certainly a lot to read to give you more detail and draw you into the game world. Which it should. Cause that moment you start to play it should drag you in which it dose with this. Many might say that tones of reading is boring. But this is always a key point to good RPG. No way you could have some one just speak it all out. Some might say that would be better some would say not. Hence why having both in it. Is much better. The detailed conversations from the characters and npc's down to the codex notes which give you information.The Graphics: Perfect and still now perfect in my books for an RPG like this one. The Characters are life like, even in the cinematic's. The towns and Cities are well detailed and work with the time period of the game. The npc's and even the animals. The darkness in it work even well better for game and story. Some might say it dose not. But I beg to differ.The Music: It is great. It enhances the game amazingly, drawing you into the game even more. So much work put into it, It is certainly one of the things I love in this game. Nothing more I can say. Watch this video about the music. LinkThe Reply Value: The reply value of this game. Is great to reply as the other classes certainly makes it worth while indeed. Even go different ways with them in the sense of character. Yes there is mods out there you can use to further enhance that. But on just the game it is perfect. It is certainly one game I will reply many times out of my large and I use that loosely game collection.Overall: This game is one all you RPG players should certainly have. Graphics, story, Detail. Everything works perfectly for this game. I give this 100% and 10/10StrangleholdStory: This is a Classic style story/plot. Cop go's missing and it ends up the kidnappers want one cop to come with a ransom. But as usual Cop boss dose not want to. But you Tequila end up going to do it yourself. This is what I like Defiance against bosses to go get the job done! There is definitely some interesting story lines to this game. Even at the start you see kidnapping like I have said but just not the cop. There is love and secrets to. Heck I even found some bits in funny.The Detail: There is some good detail in this game via the in game film scenes. Bring more to the story as it unfolds. There is no in-depth reading in the game. Like in some others but again this is more of Shoot first and ask questions later.The Graphics: The graphics are good to a point for now. Yes there is some limitations to it. But it stills holds it own as an HD Game. Explosions from barrels lighting up the screen. Gives me tingles all the time. Even seeing the movement waves from the bullet being fired in precision fire mode. Button number 2 on your controls which I will go into in a sec. Enemies are generic like most reviewers have said and I agree. All in all the graphics are good for this game in my books. They could be much better but. I cant really Truly match this game to todays games for graphics. I put it down to your judgment.Game play: What can I say. Controls are nice and easy to master. No messing around. Jumping in any direction or interacting with any object. I found that fun sliding accross the table and down hand rails shooting people in the awesome slow motion mode. This is called Tequila Time. Now in my mind Tequila time points to Alcohol but I digress. There is some other modes you use to. First one is Health Boost. Which is just like a First aid pack. Second is Precision Aiming which I love. When you get it right you see the kill cam. Perfect kills or even just to injure so you can get up and just pummel in a whole clip just to be evil. Third is Barrage one of the most potent modes. 20 seconds of enhanced firepower and invulnerability ripping through the environment. Lastly the Spin firing with stunning accuracy in a circle. I tend not to use this one. As I like getting up and close. Its still nice to use.The Music: THe music is good. It fits the game and game play. But if your like me with shooting games you might turn the music off and play your own.The Reply Value: Now replay value. Yeah there is reply value but since the game is long it might be more of a time filler between the games your waiting for to come out. But if you like countless shooting then yeah there is replay value.Overall: Overall this game packs an interesting classic story. Countless fighting good graphics and music and replay value even if its just to fill space. Defo worth the play. It captures John Woo movies into a game. I give this 9/10. As much as I want to give a full 10/10 even tho its got help from John Woo. I cant there is still room for improvement that can be done.			",210,83,4,67,38,3,57

												Honestly, this is that one game that I keep coming back for. I've always been a sucker for pretty graphic, but honestly, this game needs none of that. It has such well-developed world history and politics that I find deeply fascinating. The characters are endearing, and it's just not possible for you not to feel some sort of affection for them. The main plot is rich, and the side quests can affect the future, either in the end, or the other installments. It makes you want to complete them, and in a way, makes you wonder if you will see these people you have just helped again.Out of three Dragon Age installments, this has to be my favourite because it has this distinctive quality that you don't come across easily in video games.

												Let me start by saying Dragon Age Origins is by far my favorite game!!! <3	Dragon Age Origins Ultimate Edition consists of an interesting combat system, rich story along with DLC to only add to the immersive gameplay experience. Origins has an unique RPG experience with the feel of a true RPG. 	There are many game changing decisions that change the your gameplay! You venture through the magnificent lands of Ferelden with your party at your back. You have the power of choice and with that power you choice the fate of not only your venture but of your party's.	Origin's combat system is something that standout with its unique twist of features that aren't see in many RPGs these days. The combat consist of the many possibilities to pause the game mid fight to make those tactical life saving power moves to save the life of your party!	There is so many features in this game to make it so unique in so many ways that it must be experienced by one's self. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dragon age is a hell of an RPG. Amazing story with choices that really impact on the course of events. Characters that are quite interesting, funny and unique in this 5 star game. Control 4 characters with pause - tactical options and numerous skills in order to defeat the blight that threaten Ferelden. Build a party consisting of mages rogues and warriors and become the savior of the world. Good graphics, story that really sucks you in, A LOT of items and equipment for your characters and endless customization options compose the success story of DA Origins. Unique talent trees, lots of explorations and secret combination that will satisfy even the most demanding gamer.Cons: - Mages are quite Overpowered while archers have many drawbacks.

This game has so much potential to be exactly what you want in a fantasy-based, turn based, game. Turn up the difficulty for strategic combat or keep the difficulty low to enjoy the excellent story. Top notch voice acting meets well written plot design. If you're playing this on the computer, get mods for it.In a stroke of rare critique, I would give this game a perfect score. Granted, the game is older and newer and flashier games exist. You have to understand  that when you go into this game. Did you buy it yet? Buy it. Notice the difference in a Bioware product before they were bought up by EA. There's no bull♥♥♥♥♥♥showmanship. You've got a solid product that'll keep you entertained for days.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: April 24, 2015
												Oh wow, where should I start? Well first of all this is the third time I've owned the game, first on the Xbox 360, then again on the PS3, and finally on the PC.  Now this game is dated, it came out in 2009, and you can really see it when you play it.  Even cranking the graphics up to max on your pc won't do much to improve the apperance of the game.  However there are quite a few mods out there that tweak the appearance of the game, making it signficantly more pleasant, however I have not seen any total overhaul mod out there.  Do note that there is no Steam workshop for this game, but Nexus does include the Nexus Mod Manager, and has a very large selection of mods available for this game, so definitely check them out once you buy, and install this beast.Now for the meat of things, Dragon Age Origins is the first game in the trilogy, and takes place in Ferelden, the fictional nation inspired largely by medieval England, as the on set of the Fifth Blight encroaches the land.  I do not want to spoil anything, so I'll avoid talking any more about the story, but I feel that at this point in time almost everyone has played this game or at least wikia'd the plot.  This game features the point and click style combat, as in I left click over my oponet and he begins to swing his sword, then I can press one of my hotkeyes for him to use a skill.  Do not come in expecting this to be like DA II or DAI, where you'll be spamming the attack button like a game of Dynasty Warriors.  Fortunately you have regenerating health outside of combat, and mages have a healing branch, something that Bioware took out of DAI, which drove me insane, especially on Hard and Nightmare difficulties.  In this game you'll often find yourself pausing combat so you can survey the battlefield, formulate  a plan, and then issue orders, then unpause to watch your four man/woman team move out. Now I would definitely recommend playing this game on hard at least, to get a real challenge out of things, it definitely makes the game more enjoyable, and I practically live in pause mode/tactical mode.  The mechanics here are amazing, as you travel from area to area, you have a slight ability to explore each of these areas.  Now this is not a free roaming game, well not in the traditional sense at least.  You can control to which 'area' you want to go to, and within each area there is a small degree of exploration involved, but to me that was never important, seeing as how I was so engrossed by the story.  There's plenty of NPC's to talk to, a fair amount of side quests to do, and so much♥♥♥♥♥♥to pick up it isn't even remotely funny.  The Ultimate Edition also comes with all the DLC you could ever want, and the game has for that matter.  So you definitely get your money's worth, especially with the story expansion Awakening installed that (can) continue your journey after the completition of Origins.  Not to mention you have all of the smaller story/mission DLC's to play, that will take up a few hours of your time, answer some of your questions or give you some closure in some of them, as well as net you new items for your main game.  Oh yeah I forgot about the prologue story for Leliana, entitled Leliana's Song, which takes place before Origins, lets you play as Leliana, and also gets you some cool items to use in Origins (especially for Leliana!).  This game is amazing, it has so much content, gameplay is fantastic, the story will keep you hooked and playing until the sun comes back up, and you'll know why this game is the best of the trilogy.  Plus you'll establish such unhealthy connections with some of the characters you might end up getting a body pillo...uh you'll just try to learn everything about them.  Also the game gets better with mods, they're like swear words and spices, it makes things better.  Plus it'll help clean up the appearance of the game a little bit.  Personally I love this game, it's in my top 5 games of all times, and it's better then those other two, and it has a better ending than Mass Effect 3.  This game is a 10/10, you wont find a better game with as much content for this price with access to thousands of mods that make it even better.  Plus it has a story better then the entire Elder Scrolls universe.  Even Commander Shepard would tell you that this is his favorite game on all of Steam, I mean at least believe him, he is the first human SPECTRE, savior of the galaxy, human icon, and an all around great guy.

It was already one of the greatest RPGs of recent years, swapping console button-mashing with tactical, challenging combat, and throwing in a compelling story, fantastic world-building and excellent characers to boot. Now with the very active modding community, it's even better. It still looks great, plays great, and manages to unfold some pretty extensive lore without ever being overbearing. Plus, you get a dog!Worth it for pretty much any price, but the Ultimate Edition is regularly in sales for less than a fiver. You've no reason not to buy it.			",109,14,1,16,13,0,36

The game is set is a 'tactical' view which is similar to the views in games like balders gate of others. this however, instead of ruining the game, improves it. The storyline is intresting and as the game progresses you get to know your party as well. Basicaly if you like a change from games like skyrim then get this game.			",17,1,0,7,2,0,7

I really enjoyed both game. I just finished the campaign and on the way on completing the expansion, I even considering on having another run on the campaign with different race and class.

As well as being a great introduction to the series as a whole and easy to understand role playing machinics allowing a good range of gamers to play, if old but decent graphics are okay with you then this is the game you may enjoy to see what outcome you can create for Thedas itself.

												CHARACTERCRAFT! I love charactercraft in RPGs and this game does it so well, on top of an interesting, open-world story.I'm obsessed with exploring the different relationships a player can make with their companions, and there are so many ways to change characters in this game, beyond just them liking you or not.The controls are pretty standard and it handles fairly well. The gambit system players use for their AI companions is a bit strange, but I prefer micromanaging my characters manually anyway, so that didn't bother me too much.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game has an interesting storyline, 6 different origin stories to play through, and a fighting style that allows you to control not only your character's actions but the actions of your entire party during battle. Additionally, the game's events and your character's relationships with the other characters depend on the choices you make and actions you take throughout the game.I've played all 6 origin stories, had a different gameplay experience every playthrough, and spent 500+ hours of my time on this game and I've loved every second of it. I even find myself sub-consciously quoting the characters during every day life now.Maker preserve me... Dragon Age has taken over my life!10/10 would continue playing this game again and again, and definitely would recommend it to RPG lovers!			",4,0,0,6,5,0,0

												Dragons Age is well a put together RPG that will immerse you in the story and you will invest time in developing the characters that accompany you on your quest. The biggest downside to the game is the story is tried, tired and done a thousand times over. You the hero are on quest to destroy the dark spawn that is wreaking havoc on the land. This being its biggest downfall does not make this a bad game at all. I had over 40+ hours in one play through and with all the decision making you encounter this game will surely keep you amused for multiple plays. One of the best combat systems I've seen you can not only setup the AI to have your companions on the quest do what you like but you can fully take control of them which in my opinion is a huge advantage. The combat system is a little bit of learning curve but once you get the hang of it you will love it and enjoy the simpleness of how your characters act and follow your directions in the heat of some best battles you will see in an RPG. Bioware did an excellent job in creating a game you can fully plunge yourself into and get behind.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: January 22, 2014
												I was reluctant to dive into this game for a long time based on the previews I came across when it was first being marketed.  It came off in promotional material as a bro-ish rpg (actiony, poorly simulated sex scenes, apparent LOTR lifting, and yet another  tired save the world plot).  While I wasn't necessarily wrong in my initial views of the game, I was surprised at how deeply engaging the game actually is. This is a party-based roleplaying game.  You can choose from one of three races for your main (Player) character:  Human, Elf or Dwarf.  One of the hallmarks of the game is that there are 5 different ""origin"" stories for your main character.  So, you can start the game as a City Elf living in the slums of an alienage (Apartheid-like ghetto) or as a Forest-dwelling Dalish Elf living mostly unfettered by human society.  Each of the 5 origin stories acts as a prologue, but once the backstory is established the main game story begins and is the same no matter what origin you chose.  While you begin the game as a lone adventurer, you eventually have up to four active party members.  You get about a dozen or so party-members eventually, but you can only take 3 along with your character when adventuring - the rest wait for you at camp.  The combat, while real-time and of the MMO-style we've come to know with ability cooldowns and gads of useable items, is actually pretty complex tactically.  The combat is real-time, but can be paused to give orders ala Baldur's Gate, and you can take direct control of any party member at any time.  I found many battles that I came across were unwinnable until I changed my tactical approach.  I'm about 100 hours in playing as a City Elf Rogue character.  I found my ideal party generally consists of two mages and a warrior.  My mages act as healers when party member health dips low, while my warrior acts as a threat sponging tank.  I try to get the drop on enemies by either going stealth and doing a sneak-attack backstab to any enemy mages or archers before they notice my party, or by sniping them from the shadows with my bow.  Taking out enemy spellcasters quickly is essential.  Archers are also a deadly threat, especially in groups.  One neat feature is that the game has a built in scripting system for how party members behave in combat that is easy to configure.  Each character begins with some combat tactics slots for you to customize, but as they level they can unlock more tactics slots.  You can have it so a party member will heal another party member should their health be too low, cast a defensive aura on themselves or others when being attacked, or quaf a mana potion when it dips below a specified level.  Every character will use the scripted tactics except for the character you currently have direct control over.Item collection is a staple of any rpg and DAO is no slouch, with lots of unique weapons and armor and a neat item tier system.  For instance, if you find a leather helm when your character is level 2, it'll be tier 1 with lousy stats, but discover that same leather helm when your character is level 15 and it could be tier 5, 6 or 7 and have better stats with each tier level.  This applies to magical items as well.  Also, an item can be forged of different materials and depending on the material used to make it, be better than the same item created with a different material.  For instance, a steel dagger is better than an iron dagger, but a red steel dagger is better than a steel dagger, etc.Character leveling has the typical RPG attributes that govern things like magic, attack damage, resistances, etc.  There are also skill trees for specializations and more skill trees can be unlocked through quests, party interaction, special items...  Leveling characters is both thought-provoking and fun.  Some skills require meeting a stat requirement, but there is otherwise alot of freedom in how to customize each party member. Questing works in the fashion we've come to know, but the dialogue system means that the outcome of a quest can vary greatly.  How you interact in the world with the npcs, how you complete quests, or how you interact with even your own party can all change the course of the game.  For instance, in a conversation you say something to Joe Shmoe the quest-giver that a party member voices an opinion about.  You disregard that party-member's opinion and do what you want.  You might get what you want out of it, but the party member may like you less for it.  Each party member has a scale regarding how they feel about you.  If it dips too low they may leave and never return.  If it climbs you can unlock new abilities like greater constitution for them.  Part of the system is influenced by how you interact with them and part of it is determined by how you interact with the world.  You can also find and buy gifts to give to your party members.  NPC appreciation of you can also unlock romances with certain characters, some of which affect end-game results.The game world is huge and has various environs and biomes.  You'll travel through cities, forests, swamps, snowy mountains, underground tunnels, ancient ruins, ethereal realms, etc...  The game is not open world like the elderscrolls games, but if feels big and there is alot of detail to it.  You can fast travel to places marked on your map.The graphics can be a mixed bag.  Generally, they look very good, great even.  The level of detail in the game world itself is pretty amazing.  Some of the smaller details are sometimes overlooked.  So, while player models and textures all look great, especially close up in in-game cutscenes - some of the smaller details are wanting.  A few textures here and there are noticeably low-rez and some of the world geometry is of lesser quality then others.  It's not a startling difference, and it doesn't detract because it all blends, but graphic ♥♥♥♥♥s will undoubtedly not be satisfied.  There are a few texture mods that touch on this issue, but I wouldn't bother.  The game looks great as is.  Also, there is a memory leak in the game that starts to effect loading time and transitions the longer you play.  One of the larger, more expansive texture mods out there requires a beefy rig and will still crash frequently.  I myself downloaded a minimalist/purist mod that changed 48 textures - only the worst offending low-rez textures.  You can find it here: http://www.nexusmods.com/dragonage/mods/3869/?The music and sounds are all great.  The sound effects of swords clashing, glancing off shields, enemies screaming, and the whizzing of arrows are all spot on.  The attention to sound in each environment is noticeable and it really helps immerse you when you're trumping through a forest hearing wind in the trees, water dripping in caves, or the bustle in the city.  The voice acting is amazing.  Usually, the weakest point of any game is the voice acting, but every voice here is perfect.  And you will hear ALOT of inter-party banter as you travel, plenty of which is whimsical or laugh-out-loud funny.  The story itself is engrossing, but not earth-shattering in originality.  It's the smaller stories you come across as you make your campaign through the main quest that really shine - allowing you a sense of the world and it's inhabitants.  To that end, the history of the world is rich and you can discover hours of reading material within the game that's gets added to your ""codex"".I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the dungeons & dragons style of rpg gaming.  It is not, however, for the casual gamer.  While it's not as pedantic as 'Temple of Elemental Evil', it's still a game for the more serious roleplayers than those used to FF7 or Zelda.

It's well put together with a variety of beginnings depending on your characters race and background, and contains a great group of well rounded characters that add a lot of depth to the game, as well as a generous amount of humerous banter. The story line is engaging and along with a dramatic soundtrack create a very imersive experience.

												I have recently been revisiting this little gem that I once owned on Xbox 360. I wish I'd had the PC version from the start! The controls are so much better, having hotbars to put skills in is great, and the game looks very nice on PC. For those of you who havent played this, or have only played it on Xbox, I'd recommend buying it (on sale right now $7.99). The DLCs are worth the investment, and the game still keeps me captivated even though I've probably beaten it on Xbox 3 or 4 times.Those who haven't played Dragon Age can expect an awesome RPG with tons of character customization, interaction between party members, and of course thrilling and challenging combat. If you liked Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, and Icewind Dale, this is the type of game for you. (minus the D&D rules, but it still follows the basic recipe for a great party-based RPG.) Definitely a good buy at the price!!			",24,4,0,19,4,0,0

												The best rpg I've played so far. I played it back in 2009 when it came out and that resulted with a couple of forgotten months through two playthroughs. Two tumbs up for this. Much better than the sequel. Now the only hope that remains is that they don't mess up inquisition ;).			",130,12,4,20,6,1,17

												I only have like 20 hours on steam with this game, but on console I have well over 200, and I have beaten origins along with awakening with 6 different characters and my favorite to play with is the mage. Having said all of that, this is easily in my top 5 games of all time. I love the story line and how in depth it can get with desicions, and the desicions actually matter in dragon age, they affect quests, what people (mainly your party) think of you, and change the ending. The combat can be a little slow and clunky at times, but this doesnt really deter me. I prefer the big hot bar of spells and talents to the button mash system that is implemented in many newer RPGs (dragon age 2). If you want hours upon hours of in depth gameplay, in depth and deep if not sometimes tear jerking story, character romance, great boss fights with killer rewards then this is the game for you. I highly reccomend it, and at the price it's at now, it's more than worth it.			",174,38,0,36,14,0,8

												I played DA:O before it was added to Steam. If you like this style of game, it's a great example of the genre - each race and background comes with its own unique starting plotline, and both the main story of the game and the many side quests are well-written. There are lots of party members to interact with, each with their own backstory and set of quests to look into, and you can form relationships with nearly all of them. Well worth the price.

												After over 6 years, I decided to return to Ferelden.  The graphics have aged relatively well and the story is no less engaging.  It still holds true that I find myself lost for hours listening to my companions in camp by the fireside.  To come back after so long and have my only complaint be that the trees look a bit wonky from top down view is amazing. Much has already been said about this game and how great it is. If you like rpgs, give it a chance. If you have already played it- all of the DLC is included here and it may be time for you to return.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Want a good computer RPG that isn't too dumbed down despite being relatively new? Look no further, you've found it. Great combat, great dialogue, good lore, some cool bosses, etc. The only complaint I have is that the world feels somewhat instanced. It doesn't feel very open and it's split up by a lot of loading screens. But yes, overall I will give it a 9.5. A truly amazing gem. Worth picking up if you like games like Baldur's Gate 2, Neverwinter Nights, or just want some amazing tactical combat. There's also a good amount of mods available on the Nexus page that further improve the game, even though it's great without any mods; unlike some other RPGs (*cough* Skyrim *cough*)			",127,10,6,19,10,1,19

The characters are memorable and actually make you care for them, especially your companions. This was another series that suffered from sequelitis. The first game was far superior to the second game. I cannot say enough praise about this game. The expansion wasn't quite up to the greatness of the main game itself, but it is decent in its own right. Please play this game, play all the DLC. This is an instant classic.			",42,2,0,9,2,0,6

One of them (Silverite Mine bug) actually deleted all of my main characters gear! Now that is a game breaking bug that should never, ever happen. I literally stopped playing and uninstalled the game. Not worth getting some crappy seconds for my main char, not to mention trying it again...Dammit bioware, get your♥♥♥♥♥♥together.

This game in particular grabs you by the shirtcollar with addictive story, engrossing characters and meticulousness for items like never before. The only qualm I had for this game was the fade in the circle of magi (as it was long and frustrating).

Haven't found a game on this level which combines excellent tactical combat with a gripping Storyline where so much is influenced by the player. Also love it, how you're not some random guy with no memory like in every other RPG (TES, Fallout, Dragon Age Inquisition is guilty of this too), but have a rich backstory, which makes it much easier to understand you character. The fact, that not everything lies at your feet for some reason also makes the game world more realistic and fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Awesome game, and I have more hours on this than on Steam alone; I had played it for a while on the nonsteam version.Pros:+Excellent writing+Excellent voice acting+Excellent in-depth lore like in Mass Effect+Interesting story, albeit somewhat generic in some aspects (but the other aspects of it make up for that I think)+Interesting characters and interactions+Interesting character progression and system of gameplay+Interesting game world overall+Lots of mods available on the Nexus[www.nexusmods.com] (and maybe elsewhere)+Challenging on higher difficulties; some in-depth strategy involved sometimes (Nightmare difficulty on console versions is the same as Hard on the PC; thus, Nightmare difficulty on PC is one step above the highest available on the console)+Great music+Some aspects of the default visuals aren't that bad to today's standardsNeutral:~Visuals are dated to today's standards, the game hasn't aged well in some ways and in some ways it has (there are some mods to help with that).  I have only used one texture pack but there are other mods that improve the visuals.~Some chances to use exploits (more or less) for some fights, but nothing that cheap usually.Cons:-The transition from the end of the Origins campaign to the beginning of the Awakening campaign is not clearly explained in some ways; you will need to prepare your inventory before the end of Origins in order to retain items you want in Awakening.-Major bug involving the Silverite Mine in the Awakening campaign (easily fixed with this mod[www.nexusmods.com] found on the Nexus)			",56,13,0,17,9,0,7

												Dragon Age has great gameplay that entertains for hours on end, and at least for me, it had a gripping story. Depending on what class and race you play as, your character will a completely different backstory and motivations for different things. This game does like wedging you into difficult situations, where you have to make monumental moral choices. I still haven't played through all of the DLC (Awakening) for this game, but I found Dragon Age: Origins to be well worth my while.			",119,22,1,24,12,2,27

												A very good game.There is hardly anything wrong with it, the only things I found wrong with it were simply personal preferences.I love the story and the characters, the mechanics are old style, but very fun, its a game you can get easily familiar with, but dont let that fool you, the game is very difficult at some points.I find that the game uses alot of CPU, it may just be because its an old game running on a newer windows.

Anyway, for it's time period 2010, it was a really great story questline and was very fun with alot of replayability. I added it to my collection and recomend it to be added to yours as well!

												If you're like me and like to complete games in order and are considering playing this before Dragon Age: Inquisition, do it!!!I can't believe how much I loved this game! It may be old and the graphics may show that a little, but surprisingly it does still hold up and is easy to look past. The characters are all amazing, it was painful to have to choose only 3 to follow you each mission, because I wanted to spend time with them all! I felt like the whole world was alive and I was part of it. The combat is pretty challenging, but it's rewarding when you plan out your attacks and powers in the correct combination to interact with each other and cause the maximum damage. This game is so worth playing!			",51,19,0,10,8,2,22

												Possibly the best game I've ever played. It has some bugs so some missions cannot be finished, and the UI and controls take some getting used to, Also, the learning curve is quite steep so you need to level your characters carefully and plan ahead. But the atmosphere more than makes up for any problems/glitches I have found. I have really felt like being part of the story all along the way. The characters and their background stories are great, voice acting is superb (in particular Claudia Black and Geraldine Blecker). And the whole game has an incredible sense of humor: I spent long hours playing the jailbreak scene over and over again to see the various plotlines for that part as well as tried different groups of companions to hear the different ways the characters mock each other.

												Great game series. I enjoyed the hours of gameplay, the depth of story, and also complexity of the overall mythos of Dragon Age and all its DLC. This game had just the right blend of character, fighting, class systems, story, and humor. On top of your own storyline, there are plenty of characters peppered into your party that have their own storys and quests that you may pursue if you like. As with any good RPG, you get complete control of your characters background, apperance, and fighting style. I played through the first half of the game 3 times before I finally settled on an female elf rogue build. The quests are pretty straight forward in most cases, nothing incredibly challening or puzzling...but the fights are brutal. Unless you play on easy, be prepared to die a lot. Not a problem really when you can pretty much save game whenever you like. I've always liked the combat pause function in games like SW:KOTL and again it works well here giving your party time to plan its next spell or attack. The combat itself is varied, and there are quite a few different builds you can acheive with race, class, and specializations. The spell system is follows suite, its diverse and rife with ways to achieve mage dominance. Only downfall for me was a few crashes when the spells and fighting really got hectic. I attribute it to my lack of resources on my PC, but was still frustrating enough it bears mentioning. 9 out 10. Fun to play, hours of content.			",81,4,1,15,8,2,20

A guide on steam listed it after and when I tried that it worked.___________________Then edit your Documents\BioWare\Dragon Age\Settings\KeyBindings.iniand change the OpenConsole_0 line to something else, for exampleOpenConsole_0=Keyboard::Button_F7So when you press F7 it will open the developer console.___________________Then you can do all kinds of things with the developer console; like god mode, add any amount of money or skill points, jump to any point in the game, add or remove characters, etc.. There's a list of the commands you can use if you scroll down a bit on the wikihttp://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Console_%28Origins%29#If you do this, make sure to use the mod to make the commands visable while you type them.

												Bioware's entrance to a new serires is by far the best start any company has had, in my opinion. Also in my opinion, the best out of the series as of writing this. (Dragon age 3 is not yet out)Dragon Age is a RPG with a DND feel to it. It's got loads of Weapons and Armour to provide great flexability while also providing a good amount of spells and specializations.It's got detailed companions who act and re-act to the choices you make. They don't just feel like mindless drones following your about because Bioware knows how to make a great character. Just look at the Mass Effect seires. :)The story isn't exactly new to Bioware, but the details are. It fits in perfectly within the fantasy world they've created. Similar to Mass Effect, you will have a lot of choices to make, adding replayability.Dragon Age and Dragon Age Awakening are well supported by the modding community.The game provides great graphical appeal and stability, the DLC are nice for a short respite and the Awekening expansion pack is a proper expansion. Providing a new story, and even allowing your character to cross over into the expansion, complete with your entire inventory.The only negative is that there appears to be a slow memory leak which is most notable lower-end machines. It's not crippling like other games which have a memory leak and is easily setback by re-starting the game every few hours, like when you go get a cup of coffee, or food.I highly recommend Dragon Age if you are a fan of the work the Bioware does, or if you love RPG's. This is definetly one of those games you will remember for quite a long time.			",260,41,3,58,51,3,57

I've played at least 4 playthroughs on origins and awakening (making this my fifth) and I always end up coming back. Every little decision and character can give you a completely different playthrough, yea a lot of the missions will bw the same, but enough changes to keep it intresting.

												DA:O is an incredibly fun tactical squad-based RPG. The story is solid and character decisions make a HUGE difference, especially as you can import your save from DA:O into Dragon Age 2, and then into Dragon Age: Inquisition. The gameplay is just as strong, featuring a simple, easy-to-use dialogue system and a robust combat system, replete with AI tactics which can somewhat automate the process of managing 4 characters in a combat environment.TL;DR - If you like RPG games with meaningful player decisions (e.g., not what Skyrim does with meaningless player decisions) and don't mind an over-the-shoulder/bird's-eye-view approach to a tactically-grounded squad-based combat game, then this is the game for you!

												One of my favourite games to date, if not my favourite ever.Dragon Age: Origins allows you to make decisions and interact with NPCs and party members in a way that can get you truly attached to their stories. There are so many tales woven into one wonderful, complete and complex campaign which you can, to a fair extent, influence through your decisions. The combat system is very simple to learn but still can be manipulated to fit your style, and you can make this game as challenging or leisurely as you like it.Not only can I appraise the obvious, but I can also comfortably say that the attention to detail in this game, right down to the little things like the designs on the armour sets, is set to a very high standard.It's abundantly clear how much work was poured into this game. The only flaw I could accentuate would be that the dungeon crawling does get a tad repetitive, but it's necessary, so if you can forsake a hard. gruelling dungeon crawl and you're willing to give up many, many hours of your life, this game comes with my strongest recommendation.

												BioWare knows their stuff! - 10/10I am not kidding, this is one of the best games that has ever existed. The huge flawless world is always exciting to explore and the amount of lore and history you can discover is unlimited! All of the characters are well developed and interesting and voiced by great talents such as Claudia Black and Steve Blum.The Combat is okay and gets better and better and more intense with every level you gain.The Ultimate Edition comes with EVERY SINGLE ADD-ON! It's insane how much you can save by getting this.Top it of with a beautiful soundtrack composed by Inon Zur.Although the majority of the characters looks decent, some people (like me) thought some looked so much better in Sacred Ashes - the cinematic trailer. Now, I'm not much for modding but the ""Sacred Ashes Mod"" by endeavour1934 is STUNNING! I never thought Leliana and Morrigan coul look so good. AND THEY LOOK EXACTLY LIKE IN THE TRAILER!I could go on for hours about this game, just get it. You won't be disappointed.Again...10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have recently been revisiting this little gem that I once owned on Xbox 360. I wish I'd had the PC version from the start! The controls are so much better, having hotbars to put skills in is great, and the game looks very nice on PC. For those of you who havent played this, or have only played it on Xbox, I'd recommend buying it (on sale right now $7.99). The DLCs are worth the investment, and the game still keeps me captivated even though I've probably beaten it on Xbox 3 or 4 times.Those who haven't played Dragon Age can expect an awesome RPG with tons of character customization, interaction between party members, and of course thrilling and challenging combat. If you liked Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, and Icewind Dale, this is the type of game for you. (minus the D&D rules, but it still follows the basic recipe for a great party-based RPG.) Definitely a good buy at the price!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So good that I played it 3 times. My hours don't show it here, but I played the original steam version, then bought a boxed copy of the ultimate edition for cheap and then bought the ultimate edition steam version when it went on sale. Anyway, the game is the true successor to games like Baldur's gate and Neverwinter Nights. It is a fantastic game with strategic combat, where you cant just chuck a fireball wherever you want due to friendly fire. Makes the game much more interesting as it adds a layer of strategy that wouldn't be found otherwise. The game keeps the same pausable real time combat as Baldur's gate and other such CRPG's. The class system, while initially basic, branches out into many sub classes that you unfortunately have to unlock, but they stay unlocked for all future playthroughs.  It's not so bad because it encourages replay value. Most are pretty easy to unlock, but Blood Mage and Arcane Warrior are some of the best classes and are easily missable if you don't know where to look. To get blood mage you must make a deal with a demon in redcliffe as yourself, (You must be a mage to be able to do this) while to get arcane warrior you must find and help an elven phylactery in the elf dungeon. Overall I would highly recommend this game to anyone. This game begs for mutliple playthroughs, and it delivers. One thing I would suggest though is on your second or so playthrough, get a mod to skip the Fade. You will know what I mean when you get to it.			",322,63,7,102,29,4,76

It's a party based rpg with a lot of tactical overlay that is gone in modern rpgs. There is a reason why Dragon Age 2 was dumbed down because few console players completed this.

												One of the best Strategy game.  Great action along with story.  This game requires alot of microing and battle planning.  The best thing about it, is that you can play every single class and there are minimal restrictions of what you can do.  You just got to simply know how to play every role of the characters available and maximize those characters potientail.  Make sure you got a well balance team of  tank / healer / dps.  This game will catch your interest from the start to till end.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Thats Just amazing. This game is one of the best crafted RPGs I've played with a great story that you can reply countless times in a 100 different ways. A MUST HAVE			",106,20,3,27,41,3,13

												I was reluctant to dive into this game for a long time based on the previews I came across when it was first being marketed.  It came off in promotional material as a bro-ish rpg (actiony, poorly simulated sex scenes, apparent LOTR lifting, and yet another  tired save the world plot).  While I wasn't necessarily wrong in my initial views of the game, I was surprised at how deeply engaging the game actually is. This is a party-based roleplaying game.  You can choose from one of three races for your main (Player) character:  Human, Elf or Dwarf.  One of the hallmarks of the game is that there are 5 different ""origin"" stories for your main character.  So, you can start the game as a City Elf living in the slums of an alienage (Apartheid-like ghetto) or as a Forest-dwelling Dalish Elf living mostly unfettered by human society.  Each of the 5 origin stories acts as a prologue, but once the backstory is established the main game story begins and is the same no matter what origin you chose.  While you begin the game as a lone adventurer, you eventually have up to four active party members.  You get about a dozen or so party-members eventually, but you can only take 3 along with your character when adventuring - the rest wait for you at camp.  The combat, while real-time and of the MMO-style we've come to know with ability cooldowns and gads of useable items, is actually pretty complex tactically.  The combat is real-time, but can be paused to give orders ala Baldur's Gate, and you can take direct control of any party member at any time.  I found many battles that I came across were unwinnable until I changed my tactical approach.  I'm about 100 hours in playing as a City Elf Rogue character.  I found my ideal party generally consists of two mages and a warrior.  My mages act as healers when party member health dips low, while my warrior acts as a threat sponging tank.  I try to get the drop on enemies by either going stealth and doing a sneak-attack backstab to any enemy mages or archers before they notice my party, or by sniping them from the shadows with my bow.  Taking out enemy spellcasters quickly is essential.  Archers are also a deadly threat, especially in groups.  One neat feature is that the game has a built in scripting system for how party members behave in combat that is easy to configure.  Each character begins with some combat tactics slots for you to customize, but as they level they can unlock more tactics slots.  You can have it so a party member will heal another party member should their health be too low, cast a defensive aura on themselves or others when being attacked, or quaf a mana potion when it dips below a specified level.  Every character will use the scripted tactics except for the character you currently have direct control over.Item collection is a staple of any rpg and DAO is no slouch, with lots of unique weapons and armor and a neat item tier system.  For instance, if you find a leather helm when your character is level 2, it'll be tier 1 with lousy stats, but discover that same leather helm when your character is level 15 and it could be tier 5, 6 or 7 and have better stats with each tier level.  This applies to magical items as well.  Also, an item can be forged of different materials and depending on the material used to make it, be better than the same item created with a different material.  For instance, a steel dagger is better than an iron dagger, but a red steel dagger is better than a steel dagger, etc.Character leveling has the typical RPG attributes that govern things like magic, attack damage, resistances, etc.  There are also skill trees for specializations and more skill trees can be unlocked through quests, party interaction, special items...  Leveling characters is both thought-provoking and fun.  Some skills require meeting a stat requirement, but there is otherwise alot of freedom in how to customize each party member. Questing works in the fashion we've come to know, but the dialogue system means that the outcome of a quest can vary greatly.  How you interact in the world with the npcs, how you complete quests, or how you interact with even your own party can all change the course of the game.  For instance, in a conversation you say something to Joe Shmoe the quest-giver that a party member voices an opinion about.  You disregard that party-member's opinion and do what you want.  You might get what you want out of it, but the party member may like you less for it.  Each party member has a scale regarding how they feel about you.  If it dips too low they may leave and never return.  If it climbs you can unlock new abilities like greater constitution for them.  Part of the system is influenced by how you interact with them and part of it is determined by how you interact with the world.  You can also find and buy gifts to give to your party members.  NPC appreciation of you can also unlock romances with certain characters, some of which affect end-game results.The game world is huge and has various environs and biomes.  You'll travel through cities, forests, swamps, snowy mountains, underground tunnels, ancient ruins, ethereal realms, etc...  The game is not open world like the elderscrolls games, but if feels big and there is alot of detail to it.  You can fast travel to places marked on your map.The graphics can be a mixed bag.  Generally, they look very good, great even.  The level of detail in the game world itself is pretty amazing.  Some of the smaller details are sometimes overlooked.  So, while player models and textures all look great, especially close up in in-game cutscenes - some of the smaller details are wanting.  A few textures here and there are noticeably low-rez and some of the world geometry is of lesser quality then others.  It's not a startling difference, and it doesn't detract because it all blends, but graphic ♥♥♥♥♥s will undoubtedly not be satisfied.  There are a few texture mods that touch on this issue, but I wouldn't bother.  The game looks great as is.  Also, there is a memory leak in the game that starts to effect loading time and transitions the longer you play.  One of the larger, more expansive texture mods out there requires a beefy rig and will still crash frequently.  I myself downloaded a minimalist/purist mod that changed 48 textures - only the worst offending low-rez textures.  You can find it here: http://www.nexusmods.com/dragonage/mods/3869/?The music and sounds are all great.  The sound effects of swords clashing, glancing off shields, enemies screaming, and the whizzing of arrows are all spot on.  The attention to sound in each environment is noticeable and it really helps immerse you when you're trumping through a forest hearing wind in the trees, water dripping in caves, or the bustle in the city.  The voice acting is amazing.  Usually, the weakest point of any game is the voice acting, but every voice here is perfect.  And you will hear ALOT of inter-party banter as you travel, plenty of which is whimsical or laugh-out-loud funny.  The story itself is engrossing, but not earth-shattering in originality.  It's the smaller stories you come across as you make your campaign through the main quest that really shine - allowing you a sense of the world and it's inhabitants.  To that end, the history of the world is rich and you can discover hours of reading material within the game that's gets added to your ""codex"".I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the dungeons & dragons style of rpg gaming.  It is not, however, for the casual gamer.  While it's not as pedantic as 'Temple of Elemental Evil', it's still a game for the more serious roleplayers than those used to FF7 or Zelda.

												BioWare knows their stuff! - 10/10I am not kidding, this is one of the best games that has ever existed. The huge flawless world is always exciting to explore and the amount of lore and history you can discover is unlimited! All of the characters are well developed and interesting and voiced by great talents such as Claudia Black and Steve Blum.The Combat is okay and gets better and better and more intense with every level you gain.The Ultimate Edition comes with EVERY SINGLE ADD-ON! It's insane how much you can save by getting this.Top it of with a beautiful soundtrack composed by Inon Zur.Although the majority of the characters looks decent, some people (like me) thought some looked so much better in Sacred Ashes - the cinematic trailer. Now, I'm not much for modding but the ""Sacred Ashes Mod"" by endeavour1934 is STUNNING! I never thought Leliana and Morrigan coul look so good. AND THEY LOOK EXACTLY LIKE IN THE TRAILER!I could go on for hours about this game, just get it. You won't be disappointed.Again...10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of my favourite games to date, if not my favourite ever.Dragon Age: Origins allows you to make decisions and interact with NPCs and party members in a way that can get you truly attached to their stories. There are so many tales woven into one wonderful, complete and complex campaign which you can, to a fair extent, influence through your decisions. The combat system is very simple to learn but still can be manipulated to fit your style, and you can make this game as challenging or leisurely as you like it.Not only can I appraise the obvious, but I can also comfortably say that the attention to detail in this game, right down to the little things like the designs on the armour sets, is set to a very high standard.It's abundantly clear how much work was poured into this game. The only flaw I could accentuate would be that the dungeon crawling does get a tad repetitive, but it's necessary, so if you can forsake a hard. gruelling dungeon crawl and you're willing to give up many, many hours of your life, this game comes with my strongest recommendation.

												Dragon Age: Origins stands as one of the most memorable rpg experiences I've ever had. Memorable because it does something that too many games nowadays don't do. It invests you into the story. Your choices influence the way a lot of story elements pan out. Sure the game follows a fairly defined progression but it is your choices that influence the way certain characters react during that progression. And while it might seem trivial, in reading, it can impose a very broad spectrum of emotional connections with the characters in your party. If you haven't played Dragon Age: Origins you're seriously cutting yourself out from a fantastic experience. This is not your generic Jrpg. This is a powerful epic that spins multiple perspectives on race inequality, the meaning of life, the essence of good vs evil in the eternal struggle for moral/ethical definition of a corrupting world, and theological/mystical affluence.Don't deny yourself one of the greatest RPG experiences ever created. Get Dragon Age: Origins as soon as you can and let yourself be moved by a true masterpiece.			",603,124,13,108,47,7,69

												A great RPG that I would defintely recommend. The storyline starts off different depending on what race and background you choose but eventually it all comes together. There will be little differences here and there depending on what you choose as well, sometimes in choices you make and other times in the dialogue between characters. The fighting can be interesting especially as a mage because you can combine spells and have different effects. For example, putting down grease and using a flame spell to create a giant grease fire. You can also build relationships with your companions and romance one or more. Many of the choices you make will carry on and have some sort of effect in the second and third installment of Dragon Age.			",85,68,1,46,21,3,15

												A good RPG, but can get very tedious. Unlike something like Oblivion, where you have free reign to do whatever you want, Dragon Age Origins is quite linear, so the 50+ hours you put into completing the game will feel like 50+ hours. It's certainly worth a play if you've never touched it, but despite its multiple origin stories it's not really worth another playthrough.			",211,43,3,42,21,2,47

												Dragon Age: Origins is among one of Bioware's best. Gameplay is a nice balance between the old school D&D rule sets and the streamlining of today's RPGs. There’s a nice range of visuals and environments, lots of player choices, good characters and a good story, even if it’s a bit cliché. Plus it comes with all the DLC packs and the expansion. If you can get over the massive file size (25Gb), there are lots of hours of fun to be had here.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dragon Age: Origins remains as one of the best fantasy roleplaying games in existence. Everything vital to a successful RPG is present: a quality character progression system, a gripping and immersive storyline, fantastic music, ambience, and sound effects, supremely developed and dynamic characters, and an actively enjoyable combat system. This game provides an exceptionally entertaining experience (with an estimated forty hours of gameplay) with tremendous replay value, as there are a variety of alternative choices you may decide throughout the game's nonlinear epic. For any fan of RPGs or fantasy, Dragon Age is a necessity!For some background information, you'll be able to select from several Origins (three races: human, elf, and dwarf) and be conscripted into an order known as the Grey Wardens, hunters of creatures known as Darkspawn. As a Grey Warden, you will observe a period of Blight in which an Archdemon, the highest member of the caste of darkspawn, is present. Though a Blight occurs, you will face several political challenges as the entire country of Ferelden is in turmoil. You and your band of party members will have the combat this threat yourself. The story is ultimately highly intriguing.			",134,13,4,15,10,1,17

												An amazing RPG very similar to KOTOR. save the world from darkspawn, basically orcs from LOTR.  Choose one of six origin stories to start your game and become the hero of ferelden. 3 classes to choose frommany different skills to learn through leveling up, and plenty of different party members to recruit as well.  If you are a fan of RPGs, do yourself a favor and get this game.			",59,2,0,10,4,1,12

												An incredibly good RPG with great cutomisation, although party choice can be limited due to only having one stand-out healer if not creating one yourself. While your choice of racial origin will change little within the story it does impact it enough to make sure you know where you came from, and each major quest provides interesting, and sometime blurred moral choices. The ability to mod this game also allows for some interesting changes on multiple playthroughs, also increasing Dragon Age: Origin's vast replay value.			",158,12,1,30,12,0,30

												I had actually initially owned Dragon Age: Origins for the Xbox, but the system died and a year or two passed and I DL'd it for the PC through Steam. If you are a completionist like me, this game is going to take a toll on you. There are a LOT of options and I don't necessarily know that it's possible to play every possible combination. That being said, if you are looking for a dark fantasy RPG, this is probably a good on. Set in aerial 3/4 view (not unlike diablo) the game handles easily. I wished it was an FPS RPG like the Elder Scrolls games, but it's not too bad. The combat is relatively simple, and the story is extremely immersive. If you like an RPG that really allows you to carve out a character an delve into their choices as the world around you forms based on it. Play this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Recently decided to pick up the ultimate edition of this game, having owned the physical copy of the original since the year that DA:O came out. Altogether I've probably spent over 200 hours into this game and if you were to do a full playthrough inculding all the DLC and the explansion you might be looking at around 70 hours of immersive gameplay. Origins in itself is largely about what race/class combo you choose and subsequently throughtout the game you will experience different interactions that promote the game's replay value. So in my opinion it's well worth the money these days.However having never tried the Awakening expansion before, I was surprised by how easy it was even on the hardest difficulty compared to the original game. To me if felt like your hero—if you choose to import from origins—is too well geared at that point and has way too many skills attributes, to the point where often I couldn't even find a place to spend points to maintain my builds later in the game. And add the fact that companions were not so fleshed out in the expansion through things like specific character stories and conversations, you will be surprised at the transition from the base game to the expansion.Nonetheless the base DA:O game is a RPG that I would recommend to all who are interested in a unique pause-combat system in addition to a great fantasy story.

												Let's start with the positives and then go to the negatives.For the positives:+Great storyline. You will find a rich story filled with a lot of lore. The codex is also a great idea, and you can get more immersed into the storyline in Dragon Age Origins.+Memorable characters. Every single companion that you find has a great backstory and each of them their own niches. They each had a great characteristic about them that give each of them their own personality. None of them (Other than Secret Companion) can be hated, and they each have their redeeming qualities that make up for some flaws in their personalities. But come on, no one is perfect, there has to be flaws.+Tactics. Yes, you need tactics to survive if you play Normal difficulty or higher. Don't go in thinking you're Rambo, because you aren't.+Replayability. This game is extremely replayable. Given that there are multiple endings, multiple starts, and multiple branches throughout the game. You will spend a lot of time replaying the game.Now, for the cons of the game:-No controller support. I know there are third party software that allows you to play the game with controllers, but come on. There are other games from 2009 and before that have controller support on the PC. Why didn't Bioware somehow figure out how to do this?-Save system sucks. Quicksaves don't work. The saves that you have can sometimes NOT work. I have checked online for something for this issue. Nothing. Needs to be fixed.-The game crashes a LOT. There are some instances where you have a lot of combat, and you can't quicksave or save. Though, because of this, you need to save a lot because of stuff like this. Overall, other than the mechanical issues, Dragon Age Origins is worth the gameplay. Play it with mods. The vanilla game is really awkward at some parts, and you'll understand which parts are.Edit: I'm going to add a few more things to the Cons list. I found this out while playing the game even more.-Once it stops responding, it stops responding. I honestly don't think that Dragon Age Origins was optimized for the PC. There are parts of the game where you want to reload, and sometimes it takes 10-15 minutes for a small area to load. When you go in, it lags a bit, and I tried to restart the game. It wouldn't let me do such a thing. After that debacle, I decided to close it through Task Manager. Another 30 minutes passed, and it wouldn't close, forcing me to restart the computer just to gain use of it again. -The game is extremely unbalanced. You know how people say that magic is always broken in fantasy games and that mages are always the ones that seem to be overpowered? Dragon Age is also a victim to that generalized assumption. My Rogue has high willpower and dexterity, which should pretty much make him untouchable at the endgame. Even with my willpower at around 30, my dexterity and cunning at 50, the game still has the audacity to make magic a 100% hit, and a HIGH damage output. Magic is inherently broken in this game.To add to that overall, a lot of the mechanics of this game do indicate how aged the game is. It's not bad, but if someone were to play this game at this year without prior knowledge to it, they would most likely place this game as something they would not recommend. Mods will relieve this problem, but this is a warning to any person who is still deciding on whether or not to buy this game: Lower your standards to around 2009, when the game was released. Don't have the high expectations of a seamless and perfect combat system, because Dragon Age Origins does not have a perfect combat system. It has a rusted one. Don't expect the game to be easy unless you play the mage character. Magic in this game is broken and you can essentially beat every single boss in the game without losing health with the three mages and a tank. I will still recommend this, but at this point, without mods, the game needs some serious work. If playing Vanilla, I would not recommend this game (And this series is one of my favorite series to date), but with mods, I would recommend this game to many others. To summarize:+ I would recommend this game if you play it with mods.- I would not recommend this game if you decide to play it Vanilla.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At first I despised the whole ""group controlling"" aspect, because I was looking for another RPG like TES. But after spending 1-2 hours, I started feeling oddly attracted to the game. I literally fell in love. The story is amazing, the graphs are still pretty decent after 4 years, the gameplay is fantastic. Amazing ""tactics"" system that inspired me to actually strategize my attacks. All hands down, probably the best RPG I played in a long while. That being said, a few things must be said. Firstly, SAVE A LOT. Some quests can be BUG nests, so be extra cautious. Secondly, before you even CONSIDER trying to build a GENERAL character, know that you will encounter party members of different classes, so just pick one path and master it. Otherwise, you will end up creating a weakling-deadweight character whom you will always have to carry in to battle. Long story short, you won't have enough time to master every single skill, so just master one or two if you are lucky.			",81,24,2,15,4,1,6

												I have beaten this game on origin.Fun facts for people interested in playing itit includes basically two epilogues, and several additional questsif you go onto bioware social or just check the dragon age website you can get all of the additional promotional content for free as well. When combined all of this makes for a game that is mass effect 2 levels of awesome. On Pc your lucky enough to have mods that will make the game look and feel like it meshes well with the other two titles DAII and DA Inquisition. Its either plays like a point and click, or a tactical RPG depending on how you go about pursuing each quest. Easy enough to complete, but with enough challenge to make you invest at least 45-50 hours (if you try to complete every quest). The characters leave an impression, and in all honest this game is put together well enough that you can beat it and then hop straight into inquisition without missing a beat. for I'd give it a 7.5 out of 10 the missing two and a half points is just because the graphics are a bit under par especially considering this game was released around the same time as mass effect 2. That being said modded it feels more like a 8.5 out of ten. Not quite there graphically but significantly better than where it was.			",116,15,0,18,3,0,5

												Customizable characters, difficult decisions (no red or blue or right or wrong like other games), funny dialouge between characters, epic boss fights, weapons, romance, and over 100hrs of gameplay.....What more could you ask for from an RPG game. The main story is amazing. You will laugh, cry, and ponder about you're past decisions as you progress through the many hours of the game. Always was a fan of the original dragon age orgins edition, so buying the Ultimate was a no brainer for me. The DLCs whether following the main story or occuring after the main story may not be the longest, but they are definitely interesting and will leave you wanting to knwo what happens next. The Awakening DLC is fantastic though; being able to lead the Graywardens and make decisions not just for yourself but for a city of people is stressful , but rewarding. Also being able to be reunited with former friends and make many new ones is also a nice change in pace. The darkspawn in this dlc are also more interesting since there are those who talk and do things with a purpose not just because they can. Overall, get this game!!! Whether its the regular edition or the Ultimate Edition, either one wil be worth every last buck.			",34,16,0,17,1,0,4

Everything in DAO is a dull shade of either brown or grey, with some red blood splatter for highlights.  Overall, I'd give it a 3.5 stars out of 5, definitely worth playing!			",23,3,0,11,6,0,2

I highly recommend picking up the trilogy and playing through all three in a story arc...and then playing it all over again with a different race and class, making different choices as there is a ton of re-playability here aswell.  A true classic of the RPG genre.			",47,14,0,15,5,0,9

												""In war, victory. In peace, vigilance. In death, sacrifice.""Peace is over and war rages as another Blight spreads upon the lands of Ferelden, led by an archdemon that intends to destroy the world with its corrupting taint. You, a newly recruited gray warden, is among the few who can defeat the creature and put an end to its destruction. However, first you must raise an army to combat the darkspawn hordes, gain political favors to end civil war, and most important of all: survive all the horrors you encounter along the way.""Dragon Age: Origins"" is but an amazing story of social and political intrigue, filled with compelling dialogs, interesting characters and wonderfully written plots. The choices presented along the way have a true impact on how the story progresses, and many of them are such tough decisions that the need for a curious replay often presents itself. For these reasons, and more, this game stands as one of my most favorite games of all time.			",80,23,1,12,6,0,6

												Back in 2010, I had trouble when BioWare handed the support over to EA (How could you!? *curses*). I basically lost my original account and was provided with one that did not contain all the bonus items I had acquired, because EA is apparently incapable of transferring data correctly (I was in touch with the support for about three years, then I gave up). Thanks a lot, a 100 bucks wasted on the CE and the bonus packs back then. I was so angry I simply ignored DA:O.Fast forward to New's Year's 2014/15: Now here's a super nice discount at Steam! 5 bucks for the whole package, including all the bonus items (and those that are not included can easily be downloaded for free at BioWare Social). So I decided to start all over and give the game another shot, five years later. Thank you, Steam! I fell in love with this wonderful piece of work all over again. Great story, nice graphic, great gameplay and a gripping atmosphere. After all, the developers are not accountable for the EA fiasco. ;)			",86,68,3,9,1,0,4

												Dragon age is a hell of an RPG. Amazing story with choices that really impact on the course of events. Characters that are quite interesting, funny and unique in this 5 star game. Control 4 characters with pause - tactical options and numerous skills in order to defeat the blight that threaten Ferelden. Build a party consisting of mages rogues and warriors and become the savior of the world. Good graphics, story that really sucks you in, A LOT of items and equipment for your characters and endless customization options compose the success story of DA Origins. Unique talent trees, lots of explorations and secret combination that will satisfy even the most demanding gamer.Cons: - Mages are quite Overpowered while archers have many drawbacks.

												This game remains a great example of how an excellent story line, detailed environment, and classic combat system can remain popular and mainstream, while playing using a nostolgic style and a sense of the epic.  This game, years after its inital release, is still a favorite among many fans because of its immersive story, extreme replay value, and plain fun gameplay.  I'd reccommend it to anyone.The sequel?  Maybe the 3rd will be better.			",61,12,0,35,6,1,12

												Oh wow, where should I start? Well first of all this is the third time I've owned the game, first on the Xbox 360, then again on the PS3, and finally on the PC.  Now this game is dated, it came out in 2009, and you can really see it when you play it.  Even cranking the graphics up to max on your pc won't do much to improve the apperance of the game.  However there are quite a few mods out there that tweak the appearance of the game, making it signficantly more pleasant, however I have not seen any total overhaul mod out there.  Do note that there is no Steam workshop for this game, but Nexus does include the Nexus Mod Manager, and has a very large selection of mods available for this game, so definitely check them out once you buy, and install this beast.Now for the meat of things, Dragon Age Origins is the first game in the trilogy, and takes place in Ferelden, the fictional nation inspired largely by medieval England, as the on set of the Fifth Blight encroaches the land.  I do not want to spoil anything, so I'll avoid talking any more about the story, but I feel that at this point in time almost everyone has played this game or at least wikia'd the plot.  This game features the point and click style combat, as in I left click over my oponet and he begins to swing his sword, then I can press one of my hotkeyes for him to use a skill.  Do not come in expecting this to be like DA II or DAI, where you'll be spamming the attack button like a game of Dynasty Warriors.  Fortunately you have regenerating health outside of combat, and mages have a healing branch, something that Bioware took out of DAI, which drove me insane, especially on Hard and Nightmare difficulties.  In this game you'll often find yourself pausing combat so you can survey the battlefield, formulate  a plan, and then issue orders, then unpause to watch your four man/woman team move out. Now I would definitely recommend playing this game on hard at least, to get a real challenge out of things, it definitely makes the game more enjoyable, and I practically live in pause mode/tactical mode.  The mechanics here are amazing, as you travel from area to area, you have a slight ability to explore each of these areas.  Now this is not a free roaming game, well not in the traditional sense at least.  You can control to which 'area' you want to go to, and within each area there is a small degree of exploration involved, but to me that was never important, seeing as how I was so engrossed by the story.  There's plenty of NPC's to talk to, a fair amount of side quests to do, and so much♥♥♥♥♥♥to pick up it isn't even remotely funny.  The Ultimate Edition also comes with all the DLC you could ever want, and the game has for that matter.  So you definitely get your money's worth, especially with the story expansion Awakening installed that (can) continue your journey after the completition of Origins.  Not to mention you have all of the smaller story/mission DLC's to play, that will take up a few hours of your time, answer some of your questions or give you some closure in some of them, as well as net you new items for your main game.  Oh yeah I forgot about the prologue story for Leliana, entitled Leliana's Song, which takes place before Origins, lets you play as Leliana, and also gets you some cool items to use in Origins (especially for Leliana!).  This game is amazing, it has so much content, gameplay is fantastic, the story will keep you hooked and playing until the sun comes back up, and you'll know why this game is the best of the trilogy.  Plus you'll establish such unhealthy connections with some of the characters you might end up getting a body pillo...uh you'll just try to learn everything about them.  Also the game gets better with mods, they're like swear words and spices, it makes things better.  Plus it'll help clean up the appearance of the game a little bit.  Personally I love this game, it's in my top 5 games of all times, and it's better then those other two, and it has a better ending than Mass Effect 3.  This game is a 10/10, you wont find a better game with as much content for this price with access to thousands of mods that make it even better.  Plus it has a story better then the entire Elder Scrolls universe.  Even Commander Shepard would tell you that this is his favorite game on all of Steam, I mean at least believe him, he is the first human SPECTRE, savior of the galaxy, human icon, and an all around great guy.

												An amazing tactical RPG. Still holds up to scrutiny after all this time.I've just bought it a second time, just to have on my steamlist - it's that good.If you're new to the series, give the second game a miss unless it's going cheap...As with the Mass Effect games, EA pushed for a more action, less RPG and less tactics based game... to it's detriment.I've read that the devs are making the next DA game to be allot closer to the original. Which can only be a good thing.The Ultimate edition is great value, it packs some great DLC - Awakening - with some content packs that were not great value when they were released stand-alone. As a whole pack though, I'd definately recommend teh ultimate edition over the main game on it's own.			",224,52,1,40,7,0,32

There is an amazing world to explore and great characters to interact with. Choices are presented to you around every corner and everything in the game is a spectacle. Get your fantasy on and slay some demons, orcs, and dragons as whatever class you want. Seriously, be a wizard and toss around some ridiculous spells or go for the typical sword and board fighter. I don't care, just play this game.			",818,217,10,103,64,10,113

												I cannot say enough good things about Dragon Age: Origins. The storyline, soundtrack, characters.... all of it. It is a masterpiece. I became extremely attached to my characters, the relationships with the other members in the party, and became very invested in the story. Complemented with one of the best game soundtracks of all time, it is a truly immersive experience.This game, in every way, shape, and form is superior to its sequel: Dragon Age 2. I suspect the purchase of Bioware by EA severely diminished their creative license or gave them an unreasonable deadline. Dragon Age 2 plays like an empty shell of Origins.			",64,4,0,14,8,0,6

Now with the very active modding community, it's even better. It still looks great, plays great, and manages to unfold some pretty extensive lore without ever being overbearing.

												One of the greatest rpgs on earth! I believe this is a much bigger and more expansive game than mass effect, because of the choices. You get 3 classes, 3 races, and many starting points to choose from. Where you go next, who succeeds the king, you will you take with you in the next area, which specialties and abilities do you choose, the possibilities are almost endless you will keep creating new characters to try them all. I am currently playing through the game with 3 different characters, and have already beaten it once. Awakening is pretty good, I like the new characters and the story is interesting, and is a good ride as well. The only dlc I have played is Darkspawn Chronicles which has been a hell of a lot of fun running through humans as an ogre. If you like rpgs you need to give dragon age a try.

												DA:O is an incredibly fun tactical squad-based RPG. The story is solid and character decisions make a HUGE difference, especially as you can import your save from DA:O into Dragon Age 2, and then into Dragon Age: Inquisition. The gameplay is just as strong, featuring a simple, easy-to-use dialogue system and a robust combat system, replete with AI tactics which can somewhat automate the process of managing 4 characters in a combat environment.TL;DR - If you like RPG games with meaningful player decisions (e.g., not what Skyrim does with meaningless player decisions) and don't mind an over-the-shoulder/bird's-eye-view approach to a tactically-grounded squad-based combat game, then this is the game for you!

												I had long heard about this game series, but had yet to play it until recently. Having been a big fan of the Neverwinter Nights series, which I still am, I had to play this when I found out it was made by the same group, Bioware. I have yet to regret that decision. The storylines for each ""origin"" are incredible, to match the rest of the game. Plus being able to be a queen in the right scenario? Awesome. I full recommend it for RPG fans....and for any Bioware fans as well! Give it a shot..you won't regret it!10/10 for sure!			",53,25,5,10,8,3,4

												Sure, It says that I only have a few hrs of game play but that is just because I just recently got this on steam. I have logged so many hrs into this game and it is, hands down, one of the better games on steam right now. With huge replay value and in depth back story, this game is a must have. WHen I seen this was on sale with 9 DLCS, for only $7.49 I grabbed a copy for both me and my girlfriend. If you are a fan of the xbox games like Star wars KOTOR, then this is sure to grab you by the face and scream ""For the Grey Wardens"". It is eveything you would expect from an BioWare game! This is still true~!			",253,56,7,30,15,3,24

												A very long, but excellent game overall. Aside from the Elder Scrolls series, I don't know any games that will give you more bang for your buck than Dragon Age (: Origins - Ultimate Edition). If you go through all the DLC and finish most of the sidequests in the game you'll easily spend over 100 hours on a single run, and there were hardly any points in the game where I felt like the plot was starting to drag.The gameplay is good overall. I do think the strategy elements were sometimes a bit tedious though. I didn't like pausing battles every 0.5 seconds to give all of my characters new orders and it was also difficult sometimes to get my characters to do exactly what I wanted them to, when I wanted them to. The AI is not as bad as in Mass Effect 1, but I still often had to deal with things like my ranged fighter throwing herself into melee combat rather than keeping distance and my assassin attacking enemies head on rather than trying to backstab. The game does provide you with Tactics slots to tell your characters in advance how to respond to situations in battle, but that takes a lot of time to set up and doesn't always give good results. As with most BioWare games (KOTOR, Mass Effect), they've put a lot of effort into developing the main characters and giving them intruiging backstories. However, in Dragon Age I feel like they've even taken it a few steps further. Each individual character gets lots of 'screen time' (if you bother to talk to them) and the romance sidequest has been worked out a lot more than in their previous games. One of the gameplay elements is a 'relationship' system that will make choices you make during the game affect your relationship with your party members. A good relationship will make characters befriend you or fall in love with you (revealing more of the character's backstory), a bad relationship might make the character leave the party permanently. Personally, I really loved this and wish more RPGs had this. What I particularly loved about this game is that the choices that you face during the development of the plot aren't always as straightforward as picking a good or bad option. You will face plenty of dillemmas in which it is not so obvious what the outcome of your choices will be and you'll feel compelled to apply your own moral reasoning to the situation. In the end, this makes it feel more like you're actually playing as yourself (or a realistic human being) and not someone who's putting up a goody-two-shoes / bad♥♥♥♥♥act. Anyway, I enjoyed Dragon Age a lot. I think it will please any fan of the RPG genre. It's a very well-made game overall that is more than worth the €7,50 I paid for it during the Sale.

												One of the greatest rpgs on earth! I believe this is a much bigger and more expansive game than mass effect, because of the choices. You get 3 classes, 3 races, and many starting points to choose from. Where you go next, who succeeds the king, you will you take with you in the next area, which specialties and abilities do you choose, the possibilities are almost endless you will keep creating new characters to try them all. I am currently playing through the game with 3 different characters, and have already beaten it once. Awakening is pretty good, I like the new characters and the story is interesting, and is a good ride as well. The only dlc I have played is Darkspawn Chronicles which has been a hell of a lot of fun running through humans as an ogre. If you like rpgs you need to give dragon age a try.

												""Enchantment?""TL:DR - Just buy the damn game.  It's amazing and I can't say thaI know anyone who would regret it.This game is yet another amazing addition to the list of games that prove that graphics are not everything.  This game may not be super beautiful, but I've found myself so immersed by the Dialogue, Story, Music, et cetera, that as I play, I realize I've sunk several hours into the game in one sitting when it felt like only a few minutes.Pros - Entire Game: The game is solid no matter how you analize it.ONLY CON - It is not a graphical masterpiece, but it also does not take away from the game, which is a pro within a con.At 44 hours played, and nowhere near completion of the main game or DLC, I can say this is a truly amazing game.  Even so many years later, I think this is easily one of the best games around.  The dialogue between companions and with the Player is amazing and I have found myself laughing uncontrollably countless times due to unexpected reactions in dialogue.  The voice acting is flawless and I have only found a few instances where it was lacking.  All in all, an amazing game. It stands as one of my favorites and alongside The Elder Scrolls Series, and that's saying something.			",126,21,1,10,17,1,18

												I bought this purely because of Dragon Age: Inquisition but DA: Origins is a great game that with a few mods looks great. I highly recommend the ultimate edition, forget the deluxe edition, and forget vanilla pay the extra money for the ultimate edition. It adds greatly to your Dragon Age experience and works well with Bioware's Dragon Age keep. At an easy setting you will run through the game in about 48 hours, but with 6 character origins options and 3 unique classes you'll come back for more.The game also has strict consequences to actions - like The Witcher series more than The Elder Scrolls - so choose wisely. If you are into role playing your CRPG characters then DA: Origins is a solid option with its racial, gender and class options. In terms of mods I also recommend downloading Bioware's own graphics update for  the Qunari race[social.bioware.com]. I also highly recommend using DAO-Modmanager by Altorian (this is a must have if you want to mod the game) and Dragon Age Redesigned by Dracomies and Extra Dog Slot by Dheuster. I run two or three other graphics/texture mods but to my mind these mods are necessary. All in all I highly recommend DA: Origins even if it’s 5 years old. There are a few glitchy aspects to the controls but nothing major. This is a tactical combat game not an action hack and cast adventure. Like Final Fantasy or older CRPGs you’re managing a party but with the added twist of favour points which will determine whether your companions stay with you or not (although in my experience you can easily manipulate their favour at lower difficult settings to “adore” ratings by gifting regularly.If you don’t like Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) inspired game systems or DnD/Tolkienesque fantasy races then this is not a game for you. Dragon Age is steep in the stock of fantasy tropes, the undead (Dark Spawn), dragons, mages, rogue, dwarves who live under mountains, demons and god-like dragons (don’t think just because you’re the chosen one you take a dragon on single-handed this is very definitely not Skyrim).  However if you do like DnD and do like the stock fantasy tropes Dragon Age: Origins offers an engaging storyline with good graphics and good tactical combat system.As a backstory to DA: Inquisition Origins is a good buy, but even as a stand alone game Origins fares well as a tactical combat DnD inspired game. A solid 3 out of 5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It may be old and the graphics may show that a little, but surprisingly it does still hold up and is easy to look past. The characters are all amazing, it was painful to have to choose only 3 to follow you each mission, because I wanted to spend time with them all! I felt like the whole world was alive and I was part of it. The combat is pretty challenging, but it's rewarding when you plan out your attacks and powers in the correct combination to interact with each other and cause the maximum damage.

												Want a good computer RPG that isn't too dumbed down despite being relatively new? Look no further, you've found it. Great combat, great dialogue, good lore, some cool bosses, etc. The only complaint I have is that the world feels somewhat instanced. It doesn't feel very open and it's split up by a lot of loading screens. But yes, overall I will give it a 9.5. A truly amazing gem. Worth picking up if you like games like Baldur's Gate 2, Neverwinter Nights, or just want some amazing tactical combat. There's also a good amount of mods available on the Nexus page that further improve the game, even though it's great without any mods; unlike some other RPGs (*cough* Skyrim *cough*)			",127,10,6,19,10,1,19

I would recormmend this to those who like MMOs but personally it's not my type of game.			",620,202,36,70,87,10,82

												Dragon Age: Origins is my favourite RPG, personally. It may have aged a little over the last 6 or so years, it wasn't the most beautiful game to begin with, but there's a thriving mod community with countless mods you can find to improve and/or change the game. The vanilla experience is still very enjoyable. Upon the time of writing this reviwe my Steam account has logged a 30-something hours, still rising as I'm playing through Awakening, but in my pre-PC days I must have put at least 300+ hours into this game on Xbox 360. It has a fantastic story that you can really get yourself immersed in, plenty of GOOD QUALITY DLC, and characters you love. Playing through this game, forging relationships and alliance can be great fun and even now, on what must be my 11th (or so) playthrough of this game I've found things I've managed to miss before. It's just one of those games.For me personally, it's a 10/10. It has it's issues but I can see past those because I just love this game (like most BioWare RPG's) so so much.			",118,8,7,14,14,0,26

												Best thing about this game is story (scenario). U used to play old FRP/RPG games like Eye of the Beholder, Lands of Lore, Baldur's Gate. DA is first RPG game that have really good story, and long gameplay. Used to buy retail version of game, but it is very good offer to  buy here on steam ultimate edition with all stuff included in this pack. It is not boring to play couple of times with different characters, cause story could be tottaly different. Every time is like playing a fantasy movie. Also, there is much funny ways to develope personal behavior of main charachter. This is only a single player game, but it is a ""must have it"" game in collection. Brilliant! 10/10			",40,3,4,8,2,1,5

												i have played this game off and on for a number of years, without having completed the story before just recently. it is really a great game, with alot of top notch story and plenty of dungeon crawling to satisfy the tastes of most.  the various 'origin' story branches make replayablilty high, and the expansion + add ons extend playablilty even more.      the main complaint i have has to do with the stupid approach that the parent company has taken to pc games. they have (again, stupidly) attempted to maintain an arbitrary barrier between pc and console gamers by refusing to include controller support for most of their pc titles. this would be forgiveable had they not released the same titles on each of the consoles, with, of course, full controller support. grow up! pc is the master race, but not because everyone loves kb/m. choices, choices are of utmost importance.    second complaint is how poorly the add ons and expansion were integrated into the main game. it seems that, with some extra work, they could have made it a seemless experience, but as it is i had to use the internet to see which order to play the additional content in. seems sloppy.    if not for the second part, this game would get 9.8 out of 10 from me, but since they cut some serious corners in my opinion, 9.3 out of 10. excellent game almost all around.

												Dragon Age: Origins is an amazing tactical RPG. I've clocked in about 130 hours (I'm sure there will be hours added in the future), and I cannot stop playing. The replay value of this game is very high.The characters and companions are wonderful, the main storyline is great, and the DLCs are well worth the price and add additional hours' worth to the game. Dragon Age Origins - Awakening (DLC) does have a few bugs (well, maybe more than a few), which can get very annoying and frustrating, so I'd advise keeping a few saves just in case.Overall, a wonderful game. I'm very happy with it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Originally bought this game for PS3 when it came out and played it ALOT so the hours i sank into it don't match up in Steam.I bought it because of the epic CGI trailers that spawned in between TV commercials (weird that they aren't on the store page) and bought it in a whimp without knowing what i was getting myself into. So, when i started playing i was like ""WTF is this ****""? ugly graphics (compared to it's trailer counterpart that is) and weird gameplay (didn't check the box for info. I just dived into it). But i kept going because of the story and setting. I literally played hours smashing buttons when i was in battle and thinking what crappy unresponsive combat it was :DAfter +- 3 hours i noticed you had to trigger combat by pressing a button ""ones"" (auto-attack) and select the appropriate skills when needed. I was like ""mehh"" and yet i still kept playing and then it slowly started to grow on me. When i was like half-game i was addicted! I couldn't stop playing (micro managing tougher battles! hell yeah!) and days turned into nights in a heartbeat! What voodoo trickery is this! So yeah, it was hard getting into it mainly because of the visual aspect and there's not really an in-game explenation of the batlle system (for as far as i know i had to figure it all out by myself and not being into Tactical RPG it took a long time), but story, gameplay and setting (medieval fantasy) made me forget that. And best of all... some characters you meet in this game are so loveable and if not worst; are truely missed in the next installments (besides some small cameo's) :( This game got me truely into RPG games (if you don't count ""Wonder Boy In Monsterworld"" xD )Bought it again for PC so i can mod it!Dragon Age: Origins get's 10 hearts!*crappy review i know :p			",27,7,1,7,1,0,0

												If you liked Neverwinter Nights franchise, you will love Dragon Age Origins.  The game has a compelling story and has a different introduction depending on the character you chose to play.  The graphics age well, while the UI takes about an hour to become familiar with.  The game is truly personal as the characters you chose to be your companions converse with you and each other, and your actions do affect the outcome of the story.  If you like to micromanage, you will have your time to optimize your characters; If not, than you still can enjoy the game just by picking up and wielding what you find along the way or want to buy from a vendor.  Origins + Awakenings is easily a hundred-hour investment, and will leave you eager to jump into Dragon Age II. 9/10 RPG Strategy			",72,17,0,17,6,1,37

												For a long time nothing could eclipse Mass Effect as my favourite game. This actually managed to put itself on similar ground. The characters are deep, encouraging you to care about them, befriend them, play through multiple times to experience their nuances and differing reactions to your character's personality. And each Origin, some to greater extent than others, offers you new ways to play and end the game. Add to that that these world sculpting decisions can be passed forward to DA2 and DAI, and this series can keep you building and exploring your own society several times over.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Having put over 250 hours into Dragon Age: Origins, I think I am qualified to say this is a rich, immersive game you can't get enough of. This was my first fantasy RPG game I ever played (and my second video game period), but the learning curve is not awfully steep, particularly if you are persistent in the face of adversity. (I'm looking at you, Revenant, in front of the Redcliffe Castle. BRUTAL.) By the end, you'll have developed the confidence to take on the Archdemon himself. And if you get into it as much as I did, helping the Archdemon himself as well. ;) (The Darkspawn Chronicles.)There are a few bugs that interfere with gameplay, particularly in Awakening, so don't hesitate to look up any issues you might have; all that I had were solved with a few mods. Otherwise, the gameplay is a seamless experience.If you're still here reading this review, cut down on your patience and ramp up your impatience to start DRAGON AGE!			",51,24,1,7,7,0,9

												For a fantasy game, Dragon Age: Origins is truly majestic. For such a large scale game, it has unrivaled attention to detail and virtually no flaws.  Only other recent BioWare games create characters this well, and the game is most powerful when you're talking to NPCs, shaping their attitude and defining their personalities, and when you watch the outcomes of all of your decisions. DAO is a true RPG with over 300 hours of content, and is never the same when replaying it.  There are so many critical ethical choices that will linger in your mind as you play, and there are no clear-cut good or bad choices; everything has it's consequences.  It's definitely one of the very best games ever made.			",133,24,3,22,2,1,12

												This is one of the greatest RPG games of all time, don't let my small amount of play time at the moment of this writting fool you, I've spent easily over 600 hours playing this game on the Xbox 360, and to this day it remains one of my favorite RPG games, 3rd, only to Skyrim, and Fallout New Vegas. Don't bother with buying the regular version, you'll want everything that this game has to offer, including all of it's DLC, which is why I am reviewing the Ultimate Edition, you can get a great game if you just buy the standard vanilla version, but really, don't, because the game and all it's DLC is outstanding by the standards that have been set today, not to mention the shear number of mods that are out there for this game, if you care to do that sort of thing. The game is a bit strange if you've never played a game similar to this before, but you'll quickly get used to it, and, it doesn't take an insanely powerful computer to run it, all I have for my hardware, at this time is an Intel Core I3-4150, and running the onboard Intel HD 4400, I can play the game on low settings at 1600x900 screen res just fine, no issues. Definitely take advantage of the sale that is running at the time of this review if you are thinking about buying it.10/10, but as someone else said, the Fade can get a little annoying if you don't know what you're doing lol			",20,4,0,5,7,1,1

												A spiritual successor to Baldur's gate IIDA: O is an amazing game that Bioware spent 5 years working on it and polishing it to the absolute shine. There is a whole new world for players to get lost in; World of Thedas has a rich lore and imaginative history fraught with struggles between nations, races and ideologies. A beefy and satisfying real time tactical system with a pause makes every single battle count, every maneuver you make essential, and every mistake you make can and will cost you dearly. Even today, graphics look breathtaking with amazing artistic touch to it. Music and sounds are excellent, emphasizing the epic feeling to the campaign, as well as provoking tender and mystic feel as well.Dragon Age was designed from the start to be a dark fantasy game, different from its older brethren that became golden letters in the history of RPGs. Origin tries with all its might to prove it being separate from Baldur's Gate, KOTOR and Icewind Tale series that it makes occasional blunders as well. Some conflicts look forced, and some resolutions in the story look a bit silly. But for the most part, DA: O hits all the right notes in being unique and grand, although a bit flawed experience compared to the first Witcher from the same year.The story told in the lengthy campaign is awe-inspiring, immersive and emotional. Companions in your group and NPCs are complex where each one of them has their own reasons why they are helping you; most of them aren't doing it from the goodness of their heart. Enemies, along with the Archdemon and the Architect are imposing, menacing and believable. The best character of them all, of course is YOU, the last of the Wardens, a sacred order created with only one goal: to fight the Blight that threatens the World. Like in RPGs of yore, there are so many dialogue options that will affect the game and characters around you, thus making you the most complex and interesting individual in the game. There are neither dialogue wheels nor a need for the main character to have a voice, no unnecessary simplicity and limitations in roleplaying your character. Talking to others in this game is a thing of beauty.Not everything is rosy though: some sections of the game can be a series of long fights with minimal roleplaying in them; side quests are sadly very poor and superficial, with deliberate ""fetch me this, kill me that"" vibe to it. In fact, this might be the first game that started with the trend of dumbing-down side quests, which only escalated in further Mass Effect and DA games. Lastly, game is brutally difficult, not even close to the Dark Souls sadomasochism, but casual players might be turned off to such a steep spike of difficulty.7 years after its release, Dragon Age Origins still stands as a jewel in the roleplaying waters, and will continue to do so. It has fought for its own place under the spotlight, away from other Bioware games and managed to do that and much more.P.S. Dragon Age II is good, if you can manage simplifications in roleplaying and fighting segments, and the constant repetition of certain areas in the game. The story is quite unique for Bioware, much more personal without the need to save the world; companions are as funny and intriguing as ever.P.S.S. Dragon Age Inquisition is OK, barely manageable. It is buried underneath the tedious MMO-like fighting system, huge and uninteresting maps, and superficial side-quests and of course, the greatest enemy of RPGs is still here: the dreaded Dialogue Wheel. Story is really interesting and imposing, characters you meet awesome and DLCs are actually for a change quite good, lengthy and satisfying.			",605,299,12,103,40,8,59

												This is as close as one could get to Baldur's Gate style fantasy rpg. It has everything you want, funny companions, difficult bosses, fun puzzles and epic storyline. It's a party based rpg with a lot of tactical overlay that is gone in modern rpgs. There is a reason why Dragon Age 2 was dumbed down because few console players completed this. I highly recommend you try this rpg - you will love the plot and the hilarious companion banter that is near Chris Avellone skill level. 9/10			",236,129,2,30,12,0,37

												Hands down the best single-player RPG of the last decade -- and I'd kill to make a point of that fact. While many people think Dragon Age is bad due to the bad rap its successor received, Origins is an undisputed ♥♥♥♥ing classic. The world-building is believable, the dialog is witty and entertaining, the combat is enjoyable and the game is far more memorable than all the other RPGs of its era put together. I won't even mention that it has the hottest vidya waifu in history. Morrigan approves +100			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Simply put i have played every single one of the dragon age games and all of its extra content and Origins along with all of its DLC still remains my favourite of all of them!I have played this game on xbox and pc and completed the story countless times making different decisions and different romances. Been a nice guy and been a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, point is the possibilities in this game are endless, the story really is in your hands and you get attached to the characters and geuinly have to think about your decisions based on how you want your story to go.End result is.... GREAT GAME! GO AND GET IT IF YOU HAVENT PLAYED IT ALREADY!			",43,2,2,7,3,1,2

												FOR FERELDEN!!!!!This game, is a game that comes very close, to a dream game. A world full of devastating emotions, that would shatter the mind, of anyone who actually lived under its circumstances. The cutscenes will shatter you.  POSSIBLE SPOILER.One of my favorite scenes, is a soldier, telling his wife and son goodbye. The family doesnt say goodbye. No words are spoken, but their actions say it clearly.  The soldier reveals why he must go. He understands, that if he doesnt go, all 3 of them will die. But, he also knows if he goes, he will die, but his wife and son, will keep their lives. Its overwhelming. a companion character, stuns you with a perfectly sang song.The other cutscenes are just as good. if you want to experience the greatest backstory in rpg history, buy this game.

												I know a large amount of people that have played DA, but never got round to it until late last year. Let me tell you this: best decision ever. I love the gameplay, there's so much to do, 30 hours in and I'm only 14% complete. I enjoy the interaction between the characters, and how every choice you make determines the kind of person your character becomes. I started out as a Dalish Elf, a pretty serene race far from any outside contact, and now I'm assassinating people and chose to romance Zefran. The game gives you so many options every step of the way, the only downside is, I really want to move on to the next one! Guess I'll have to be patient, because I want to see this through as far as I can.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: April 8, 2016
												Dragon Age: Origins... What you are seeing here is probably the best story-driven rpg in the world. The game has a fantastic story with fantastic characters that actually are interesting. There are so much believable emotions and personalities in this game that even the best movies have a hard competition with this game.That being said there are things in this game that is not so fantastic and there are things that are just above average but the whole package is fantastic indeed. The game suffers from bugs and glitches that lowers the score for this a well 10 deserved game otherwise. Even after their latest patch it still has problems that i will mention further down.Instead of you having to read a whole bunch of text ill just form up a list of whats good and whats bad about this game.Good:+ Interesting characters with lots of dialogs and options to choose from.+ The story alone is what makes this game a diamond.+Things you do or say in the game changes your gameplay and experience.+ Every hero you choose to be has its own beginning and it sometimes matters if youre a man or a woman.+ There are plenty of weapons and armors to choose and they are not all specified to each classes. (A few are though) So your customization is vast!+ Abilities and spells are very fun and near at hand and are easy to use+ Tactics is an excellent way to customize each and every team members behavior.+ Over 40 hours of gameplay. (If you do all the secondary stuff)+ The game rewards you for exploration and to be on the look out. There are plenty of books, objects and loots that gives you extra quests and sometimes rewards you with unique equipment.+ You can build up relationships with your teammates and even find love if you want. And the game rewards you for talking to them, give them gifts and show your interest to them.+ Combat is smooth, the AI is good for about maybe 90% of the time and the animations looks very good.+ Excellent voice acting, facial expressions, hand movements and everything. It fits so perfectly.+ Detailed graphics that looks great with maximum settings. These graphics are indeed timeless.Bad:- The game suffers from a memory bug. The more you play the game the more your computers memory gets over-loaded and frame rate drops vastly when there are many enemies and the loading times takes longer and longer the more you play. Restarting the game solves this problem but it its a pain to do. - The ending is a giant bug and glitch fest. I can max everything graphic-wise but combine the insane amount of enemies in the end with the memorybug and you have a painful delay on everything that pretty much kills the experience. For som strange reason every regular enemy dies with one hit no matter how low damage you do but the elite enemies works normally. And when they spawn they just stand still and do nothing. And when you hit an enemy it can take 5 seconds for a damage reaction.- The corpses takes sometimes forever to show its droppings. (Memory bug) This happens all the time after playing for a while without restarting the game.- The game is a bit too linear sometimes with a basic ""start and goal"" with only one way to go. Just a small minus though.- Places are reused plenty of times and it makes you travel between the same places witch can take long time especially with the memorybug. (Secondary quests suffers from it at least) And running from place to place can be a pain in the **** sometimes especially in Orzammar.To sum it all up. The game is a 10/10 from the beginning to 90% forward but ends up with a 9/10 because of the problems at the end.			",289,87,6,51,22,2,44

												Holy crap is this game ever a good one. Story rich, choices really matter, and they affect the story in really really apparent ways, especially if you go on to play the other two Dragon Age games. At times it can seem like you have to do like eighty five different hings to get the plot really moving along, that's my only qualm besides there sometimes being bugs that cost you a quest (like the fire puzzle with the demon cat) but maybe that's just me. Really good and well fleshed out characters, compelling story.			",7,6,0,6,2,0,0

It was already one of the greatest RPGs of recent years, swapping console button-mashing with tactical, challenging combat, and throwing in a compelling story, fantastic world-building and excellent characers to boot. Now with the very active modding community, it's even better. It still looks great, plays great, and manages to unfold some pretty extensive lore without ever being overbearing. Plus, you get a dog!Worth it for pretty much any price, but the Ultimate Edition is regularly in sales for less than a fiver. You've no reason not to buy it.			",109,14,1,16,13,0,36

												One of the greatest rpgs on earth! I believe this is a much bigger and more expansive game than mass effect, because of the choices. You get 3 classes, 3 races, and many starting points to choose from. Where you go next, who succeeds the king, you will you take with you in the next area, which specialties and abilities do you choose, the possibilities are almost endless you will keep creating new characters to try them all. I am currently playing through the game with 3 different characters, and have already beaten it once. Awakening is pretty good, I like the new characters and the story is interesting, and is a good ride as well. The only dlc I have played is Darkspawn Chronicles which has been a hell of a lot of fun running through humans as an ogre. If you like rpgs you need to give dragon age a try.

												Honestly, this is that one game that I keep coming back for. I've always been a sucker for pretty graphic, but honestly, this game needs none of that. It has such well-developed world history and politics that I find deeply fascinating. The characters are endearing, and it's just not possible for you not to feel some sort of affection for them. The main plot is rich, and the side quests can affect the future, either in the end, or the other installments. It makes you want to complete them, and in a way, makes you wonder if you will see these people you have just helped again.Out of three Dragon Age installments, this has to be my favourite because it has this distinctive quality that you don't come across easily in video games.

												Dragon Age: Origins is, in essence, a true treat for any RPG fan. Although the micromanaging and large array of choices you can make during the game may seem daunting at first, everything is easy to get the hang of, and the game has amazing replay value.The gameplay is fun, the story is gripping, and when you're pulled away to do something in real life, you'll always want to go back to playing DA:O when you're finished. Although I find the game tiring after more than a few hours of play, as sometimes the story itself can get emotionally exhausting (but I won't spoil you on that)!The extra money for the DLC is definitely a good deal if you know you'll enjoy DA:O or plan to spend a lot of time playing it.Story: 8/10Graphics: 7/10 (It's easy to mod the game to have better graphics, and with the mods I would easily give it a 9/10)Gameplay: 8/10Audio: 9/10 (The voice acting is absolutely amazing)Replayability: 10/10 Overall: 8/10+ Great story+ Great audio and voice acting+ Engaging combat and gameplay mechanics+ You can play this game a dozen times- Somewhat bad graphics if you play on low settings or don't mod it- Combat may be confusing at first- Planning and micromanaging is requiredSummary:If you like RPGs, games that help you develop your character as a person rather than just a silent entity, and an interesting build and combat system, consider picking up DA:O. For any RPG fan, you won't regret it.			",84,50,0,39,13,0,12

												This game is amazing. It's a spiritual successor to the old Baldur's Gate games, and the gameplay is a lot of fun. The characters are all very well-written, and there are enough alternate paths and choices to encourage multiple playthroughs.			",570,191,11,107,42,4,91

												""In war, victory. In peace, vigilance. In death, sacrifice.""Peace is over and war rages as another Blight spreads upon the lands of Ferelden, led by an archdemon that intends to destroy the world with its corrupting taint. You, a newly recruited gray warden, is among the few who can defeat the creature and put an end to its destruction. However, first you must raise an army to combat the darkspawn hordes, gain political favors to end civil war, and most important of all: survive all the horrors you encounter along the way.""Dragon Age: Origins"" is but an amazing story of social and political intrigue, filled with compelling dialogs, interesting characters and wonderfully written plots. The choices presented along the way have a true impact on how the story progresses, and many of them are such tough decisions that the need for a curious replay often presents itself. For these reasons, and more, this game stands as one of my most favorite games of all time.			",80,23,1,12,6,0,6

												To lessen the confusion,  if you get the UE version,  you do not need Origin.  With all the content you get,  just ignore all and play,  the price simply cannot be ignored.  Coming from the 360 version,  I have to say that this version is the way that it was meant to play.  For first time players,  I recommend playing ALL origin stories first.  This will help with understanding what is going on throughout Fereldan.  Enjoy			",45,3,0,7,4,0,3

												An in depth storyline and the sheer volume of gameplay involved in Dragon Age: Origins - Ultimate Edition kept me coming back for more to the tune of 107 hours worth in a single play thru!While it is not without flaws (bugs), the story, action & adventure, and multiple starting points make this game replayable many times!  Lets not forget about the fact that a custom storyline, as you played it, continues into Dragon Age 2...I give this game a minimum of  90/100.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I didn't start to play this game until about a year ago (2015), moving to a new place without internet and my trusty 360 (I didn't think to use my laptop as a gaming maching at that point)... I than proceeded to spend the next 4-6 months playing through all possible endings and getting all the achievements (base game).However I stopped shy of getting every achievement cause at that point I was exhausted and needed to do something else... but even after getting the sequels and trying out a plethora of other console RPG's nothing would quite get close to Dragon Age Origins.So here I am... just recently bought this game again for the PC (while it was on sale mind you, but I had my finger on purchase for a while now)- and seeing and experiencing this game as it was meant to has given me a second wind.The Landsmeet awaits.

												It's addicting, and I've spent way more time than I should playing this game. One of my favorite features is the ability to pause during combat and change the next action of any of my party. The game is amazing. The characters are voiced well, there's lots of chance for conversation which reveals a lot about the people as well as filling you in on the world around you. An incredible amount of time went into all the details they've given about this world. There's so much info on the characters, the storyline, the places, the history, the factions that it almost feels like a real place with real people. I got completely sucked into this game and I still enjoy it even now.			",90,76,0,30,2,0,10

Posted: December 2, 2014
												I count Dragon Age: Origins amongst my favourite roleplaying games ever made. I've played through it at least four times on console, and then some. A perfect combination of old and new, Origins appeals to fans of RPGs old and new.The game itself plays out like your typical Dungeons & Dragons inspired affair, with a wide variety of skills, attributives and abilities that govern the outcome of multiple scenarios. Though the combat animations can be a bit sluggish and dull, winning fights takes some degree of cunning and strategy, especially on the higher difficulties. More than any other game I've seen, this one takes managing your party to a whole new level. For fans of strategy games, this game will more than satisfy your inner tactician with its myriad of planning options for each and every consistency.You pick from the standard three classes: rouge, warrior and mage. However, the more open-ended structure of the leveling system allows for a lot more nuance and depth than your average dice roller. For example, on my second playthrough, I decided to be a mage. And whilst being a mage in this game is the most fun I've ever had as a mage in any game, I still prefer the path of the warrior. With a couple specialisations that I unlocked in the game, I was able to craft a battlemage that fit my tastes perfectly, capable of rushing foes down with a battleaxe and heavy armours and able to switch to a fireball or living bomb spell for crowd control seamlessly.Though the setting is extremely derivative, the world's politics and inner working still manage to be intriguing with plenty of rich lore to back it up. However, it's not the world that makes exploring Thedas on your quest to save the world from an army of orcs and an evil dragon interesting. It's the characters.For those familiar with [/i]Mass Effect[/i] will find themselves very comfortable with how [/i]Dragon Age: Origins[/i] treats party members, perhaps even more so. For almost your entire crew, you almost always have the option to kick them out, kill them or otherwise refuse your help (though you'd have to be some kind of hardcore maniac to do this). Most of them are romancable, and all of them are colourful, multi-dimensional people with their own interests, backstory, agendas and quirks. This is where making ""moral"" choices becomes difficult. Instead of any kind of morality meter, each of your followers have an approval rating with you. When considering your actions, you'll have to keep satisfying your party in mind as well. And the choices. Oh man, the choices you have to make. Some of them thought-provoking, others gut-wrenching, all of the choices you have to make are interesting, leaving plenty of room to characterise your silent protagonist. Are you a ruthless leader who refuses to compromise for your goal? Or are you a noble, naive hero who always seeks to help others? What about a greedy, power hungry sociopath? Maybe you're just a complete psycho. Whether you want to be any of these things or anything in-between, this game gives you the freedom to decide.The plot itself is as straight forward as it gets. It's an epic albeit cliche-riddled journey as you unite the land and raise an army strong enough to face a horde of monsters and the demonic dragon that leads them. Sound familiar? Does it sounds like every fantasy game you'd ever played? Dragon Age: Origins is anything but original, however it proves the rule that it's better to do something well than to do something new and fail, as we've seen with its successor. The plot is entirely character-driven, and though there are some eye-opening twists and turns here and there, it's a fairly simple, though well-written ride. That isn't why you play through, however. This game is made by the characters. Even if you don't enjoy the pseudo MMO-style combat, the action is highlighted by your interaction with a large cast of colourful, well-rounded characters. From the flawed human antagonist and his pure evil sidekick to the socially-inept and seemingly heartless witch to the conflicted albeit well-meaning bard, everyone has a story to tell, and you'll love hearing it.If any of the above interests you, please don't hesitate to buy the Ultimate Edition for ten dollars more than the base game. If $29.99 seems a bit steep, wait for a sale and keep in mind that you're getting a mind-boggling amount of content here. Aside from the high replayability the open-ended character levelling system and multiple origin stories provide, you already have a base campaign that can take you tens of hours (we're talking 30+ if you take the time to talk to people and engage in side quests) with plenty to see and do. The additional DLC is very much worth playing. The Stone Prisoner adds a unique party member with his/her own questline for you to uncover, which doesn't just add more content, it can breathe new life into the vanilla content as well. [/b]Warden's Keep[/b] is a short, but enjoyable mini quest that tasks you with clearing a new dungeon and finally siding with one of two new characters. This includes some new skills and items as well as a party chest to store your loot, though that can be done with a mod just as easily. Return to Ostagar takes you through familiar territory, but it remains a poignant reminder of one of the most intense parts of the story, despite being little more than a remixed level with extra loot and tough enemies. If you're particularly passionate about the story and its characters, you'll get a kick out of it. Feastday Gifts and Feastday Pranks are silly nothing add-ons that can be easily overlooked on their own, but as a part of the complete package, can add some cute little extras, like cleaning the party's blood off with soap, playing fetch with your dog and having Alistair play with dolls. Good fun, but not essential or even worth buying on its own.The Darkspawn Chronicles is a standalone campaign in which you play as the Darkspawn in a darker, alternate universe where the hero dies early on and the bad guys win. It's worth playing at least once for the amusing ""what if"" scenario, though I personally found it to be a bit boring without any actual dialogue or plot aside from the interesting bits of lore that detail the choices your party made and the adventures they had without you. Leliana's Song on the other hand, is a canonical standalone campaign in which you play as a younger Leliana alongside a cast of fresh faces. Their misadventures make for a fun romp, especially if you really like Leliana.The Golems of Amgarrak is another standalone campaign, this time featuring your main character from the base game, if you so choose. This one is peppered throughout with spooky lore and a bit of dialogue, but what this DLC really nails is atmosphere. It's an oppressive adventure through the darkest parts of the fallen Dwarven kingdom that leads up to a terrifying and challenging final boss, one that is easily amongst my favourite boss battles in RPG history just for the sheer satisfaction of finally taking him/her/it down. Not to be missed for any one who enjoys the combat and a challenge, or just wants to see more of their characters adventures in Thedas.The final add-on and the last to take place canonically, Witch Hunt features the return of your hero - again, unless you want to make a new guy with a different agenda - in search of a character from the original campaign. This standalone campaign has almost no new content in terms of the enemies you'll be fighting and the places you'll be going, but what it does have is a challenging campaign perfect for those who want answers (not that you'll necessarily get them) about the original game. Your three new party members are fun, and I only wish it was longer, just so you can spend more time with them.So yeah, I recommend this game.			",314,112,3,55,15,0,25

												Amazing game! Deep story line, memorable characters and good combat for its age is one of the best RPG games I have ever played. There is a lot of exploration and many quests with interesting loot. The characters are funny, interesting, and you can also romance them and import your save to Dragon Age 2 so you can play with the decisions you made. Decisions in this game are very important, you practically create your own story and by being different races and classes you get different beginnings and people react differently depending on your race and class. This is truly a piece of art and well worth your money for $30 you can look at 100+ hours in this game. Totally recommend it			",30,5,0,6,6,0,8

												Overall, I would reccommend Dragon Age: Origins to anyone looking for a lengthy and fun to play RPG campaign.First off, I'll start with some of the negatives. Graphically, the game isn't really much to look at compared to what one might be used to in this day and age of graphics and content; it's an older game, so I should hope prospective buyers can easily overlook this. Secondly, the game does have a tendency to crash (at least on my computer) if too much is going on at one time, but with the ever frequent autosaves and a hopefully attentive-in-saving player, this shouldn't prove too much of an issue. Finally, there is quite a difficulty curve, even on normal difficulty settings. Do not expect a quick walk through the part to overpowered status like in a round of Skyrim; if you don't learn to utilize strategy and your companions, you aren't going to get very far. Luckily, if you are feeling a bit overwhelmed, difficulty can be changed at any time from the in-game options menu, though I would suggest struggling through the campaign on at least normal difficulty for satisfying payoff.For the most part, that's really all the issues I can find at this particular moment. There may be more, I just can't think of them! So, let's get to the good stuff. One might expect Dragon Age: Origins to be ""like Mass Effect but in the Middle Ages"" because of the pedigree associated with it. There are certainly some aspects of Dragon Age: Origins that one may find similar to its developer's previous titles, but all and all, it's unique from both its predecessors and other big-name RPGs.In terms of gameplay, Origins blends real-time action and careful strategy with the simple press of the space bar, which pauses the game and allows the player to issue commands to every individual in the four-man party. I may also mention here the you, as the player, will find yourself filled to the brim with companions in your camp, but you can only take a total of three others (in addition to your own character) into battle with you. Honestly, it is a bit disappointing that you've got ten companions (plus the additional companions one will find in the episodic DLCs) ready to fight for you, but only three will actually go with you to fight. Anyways, I digress and continue with the gameplay. For the most part, it does have some open-world elements to make it feel closer to a sandbox than it actually is, connecting cities and environments you can explore together on a World Map or City Map, depending on the particular location. Despite the environments being fairly linear in comparison to other games and there being no optional areas in the vanilla game, there are still plenty of nooks and crannies to explore in every city, map or extremely lengthy dungeon. And I say this because some of the dungeons, both due to difficulty and overall length, feel like they take a long time to complete. I do not say this as a negative, personally, because I like the length added to the game, but for some, it may be a bit grueling.From the beginning, character creation isn't as in-depth as other RPG titles. Honestly, that doesn't matter that greatly to me, but hey, it might to you. You can choose from three starting races--human, elf or dwarf--which each have their own racial bonuses (except dwarves can't become mages), and from there, you may choose one of three classes --warrior, rogue or mage--with each class having four specializations like ""assassin"" for rogues or ""shapeshifter"" for mages. And yes, you could be a warrior or rogue, but overall, it's just as wise to be a mage and spam AOE damage spells while ordering your allies clear of the AOE (or not, if you are devious), because it will essentially decimate any non-boss group of enemies you encounter. And even some bosses. Finally, each character gets to undergo one of six origin stories, which all feature characters later introduced in the plot and can affect the plot iself later. They all eventually lead to the same place, but regardless, it's a nice touch to the game's opening.Story's not much to write home about on its own. There is a demon. It is leading an army of other demons. Maybe you should kill it. That's your traditional RPG fare. However, where Origins really shines is in its characters and lore. Firstly, there is an entire codex devoted to lore, information and bestiaries that gets progressively filled as you go through the game, providing an incredibly lengthy amount of reading content for any lore-lover. Origins is a very rich world in that respect. However, my favorite part of Origins is the interactions between characters and the personalities of the involved parties. The aforementioned ten companions you acquire throughout the game are all unique even in their skillsets, despite there being only three starting classes, and none of them feels like a carbon copy of the other. In fact, most don't even feel like they belong to a stereotypical character archetype, as one would normally find in an RPG. They feel fully fleshed out and their interactions between one another and your character feel like real people talking in the real world. Plus, the voice acting is quite high quality for most of them, so they are very expressive to compensate for the weaker facial animations of this era of gaming. Additionally, the villains one encounters in the game are motivated not by a desire to do evil, but by a want to protect others from the coming Blight and to prepare themselves for such a difficult time. I appreciate seeing characters who do evil because they see it as good and rational.So all in all? Origins is a quality game. Ultimate Edition comes packed with a huge amount of DLC for an incredible price (though with the time that has passed, I would hope that price would be incredible), complete with Awakening, which is a sizeable campaign (though certainly not Shivering Isles sizeable) with an interesting plot for the lore Origins established. It also comes with several short, episodic campaigns that explore the Origins world from different perspectives, characters and even timelimes. Would I recommend it? Yes, as I have hopefully established earlier. We can only hope the the upcoming Inquisition will live up to Origins' high-standard, as Dragon Age II failed quite miserably before it.

												Dragon Age Origins is an addictive RPG with a very rich story. The characters are vibrant , especially the companion characters. Replay ability is immense, considering there are many different options that will change the 'epilogue' of the game. Awkenings as well has many different options you can take that will change the game's epilogue, and introduces some new interesting characters, and revisits a few as well. I HIGHLY endorse this game to anyone who enjoys RPGs especially those who enjoy fantasy based RPGs, or to anyone who likes games with story rich content.			",7,1,0,8,0,0,0

												If you are into story driven RPGs then this is a must have. It is seriously an epic, in the actual sense of the word. My first playhtrough, including the Awakening and Witch hunt campaigns, took me 70 hours. I got this game and the expansions for five  bucks! Talk aboout dollar to entertainment value. It is an older game though, so the graphics are a bit dated, but the dynamic characters and immersive world overshine that aaspect. All this being said, it is a very hard game grasp. You are actually required to think about startegy, make sure your party is outfited to com,plement each other, and know how to set up the AI. All in all if you are into story driven RPGs and are willing to spend time learning how to play, then this is a must have.To bad the second one kind of sucks.			",112,16,0,14,3,0,12

												I may be one of the biggest RPG nuts around. I've played so many its hard to keep track of them all. That being said Dragon Age: Origins is probably in the top 10 Rpgs I've ever played. EVER. The story is fun and the characters are memorable. The lore that is established is incredible, especially for a game that's the first in what's hopefully a long series. The origins, the main story, and the seemingly meaning ful choices are what set this game apart.If you are familiar with Bioware games such as KOTOR, Baldurs Gate, and NWN then you know how the combat in this game works. If you don't, you need to know that combat is very strategic, and not exactly fast paced. If action packed, fast paced combat is your thing, you may want to skip this one. But if you enjoy strategizing and co-ordinating the skills of varied party members, this will go down as one of your favorites.The only cons I can think of are that there are no maps that you can just free roam on, and the cities that should seem like bustiling hubs actually feel pretty dead...This is an RPG in every since of the word, so understand that heavy story sequences, reading, and fairly large areas are all par for the course. There are plenty of things to do in the game and lots of secrets to go off and find. If you buy this game, have fun, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I have			",10,1,0,14,0,0,0

												Dragon Age is one of those few games that genuinely lives up to the hype. The atmosphere, characters, voicework, setting, and overall gameplay serve to place it in the top tier of games in general (and RPGs specifically). Though one could justifiably nitpick about certain tactical options that don't work, dialog/script triggers that don't function, and quests that don't resolve, ultimately it would all be just that - nitpicking. A worthy addition to the library of all RPG fans.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This was one of my first RPG games and i loved it from the very begining all the way to the end. The graphics may not be like some of today's games (skyrim,etc.) But the plot, characters, and creativity of the game makes it one of a kind. Its unique in its on way. It just never stopped suprising me with the new ideas that was around every turn. It explains why the third one is going to be alot like the first. If you are planning on buying it I encourage you to do so. You won't regret playing and helping the Grey warden that gather's an army from every race against the blight and the Archdemon.

The storytelling and the dialogues are fantastic, the sound effects are great and you will be immediately deeply involved in the game. The game has also a nice combat system with wide, varied and challenging characters, (side)quests and specializations. The game (+ DLC's) is realy worthwile to buy!			",56,2,1,6,6,1,14

												This is quite possibly the best game I have ever plauyed. Imagine your Baldurs gate or your Neverwinter Nights, yet given the deep dialogue choices of your Mass Effect series. If this game comes up on sale and you have yet to play it, by all m,eans it is worth the money. If you are into RPG and tatical combat, this is most certainly the game for you. I love having so many chices and listening to how my friends played through this game since there are so many story options. Feel free to tweet me how you played things out in this game @jontheword.

												Dragon Age Origins is a beautiful RPG game with a not-so-unique overarcing plot with many subplots sprinkled in between. The characters are alive and full of their own personality and own agendas. Great combat system, though it takes a while to get the hang of it. Plus you get a dog and you can ride into battle with him. (not on him unfortunately but that'd be cool. I'm sure a mod exists for that)			",35,4,0,7,0,0,0

												DA:O is my absolute favourite not only RPG game but overall RPG series. Some people may find the graphics of this first game a little outdated (though I believe there are online patches available if you're really that bothered), but other than that I would argue it's an essentially flawless experience. As long as you don't overly dislike fairly closed-world games or the occasional use of strategy in battle, there's not much else to complain about. Even if you do dislike those things, though, I'd still encourage you to give the game a chance and maybe watch some playthroughs on YouTube, just because the DA franchise gaming experience is largely unique compared to all the other games I've personally played. I think the greatest appeal of this game is the construction of the narrative. The story is deeply engrossing and involved, with each one of your actions and decisions both in gameplay and dialogue actually changing something about the world and plot. The origins (hA) you pick for your character also change not only other character's treatment of you and the skills you have available, but even the sympathies you yourself begin to hold in relation to the complex world and politics of Thedas. And, of course your role is to save that entire world, so the decisions you make send shockwaves of consequence throughout the entire game but, hey, no big deal. The UE version of this game is an excellent price for not only the long core game itself but also all the available DLCs that are included in this pack. That said, I'd still wait for a sale on the game, just because it's on sale fairly often. If you enjoy RPGs, you should be pretty damn delighted with the rich and complex experience DA:O game offers, and are bound to return to its world for later installments as well.			",47,18,0,9,3,0,0

												At first I despised the whole ""group controlling"" aspect, because I was looking for another RPG like TES. But after spending 1-2 hours, I started feeling oddly attracted to the game. I literally fell in love. The story is amazing, the graphs are still pretty decent after 4 years, the gameplay is fantastic. Amazing ""tactics"" system that inspired me to actually strategize my attacks. All hands down, probably the best RPG I played in a long while. That being said, a few things must be said. Firstly, SAVE A LOT. Some quests can be BUG nests, so be extra cautious. Secondly, before you even CONSIDER trying to build a GENERAL character, know that you will encounter party members of different classes, so just pick one path and master it. Otherwise, you will end up creating a weakling-deadweight character whom you will always have to carry in to battle. Long story short, you won't have enough time to master every single skill, so just master one or two if you are lucky.			",81,24,2,15,4,1,6

												I forgot how amazing this game is. I've already spent entirely too much time on it but with the expansions ive never had the chance to play on the console (I had purchased it and sold it right after i finished the game) it really makes playing it all over again worth it. Game play reminds me a lot of Neverwinter Nights and is pretty solid with the pause option and the switching between characters to get a feel that you're a solid unit. You can get your rogue in position to backstab while your tank (s) soak up the main damage from enemies all the while your mage is in the back crowd controlling and raining fire and ice down on your enemies. I would recommend a hundred times.			",53,11,0,4,1,2,3

												I picked this up on the 360 a couple of years back and got into it for a while but never finished it. i decided to give it another go on pc and the difference is night and day. Another great game by the master of RPG's, Bioware. This bundle also holds fantastic value with all the DLC plus the Awakening expansion that i haven't even gotteen into yet. 40 hours in and ive barely scratched the surface, pick this game if love fantasy games with great writing.

												I bought this game back in 2009 on xbox when it first came out. I didn't know all that much about it, I just thought it looked interesting. I'm glad I decided to buy because it's one of the best RPGs I've ever played. I put over 100 hours into the gme when I had it for xbox. Now a days I'm a PC gamer and when I saw Origins on sale for only $7 with ALL the DLC, I just had to get it. I have to say the PC version is a step up from the console version. Not only does it look and control better, but there are a ton of awesome mods you can install to improve the game or just add more content. The conversation system is great and really engaging. The story is pretty interesting and theres a ton of lore around it. And the battle system is a good mix between real time action and micromanagement. You can choose to play tactically by pausing the action and planning your attack or you can just run in hacking and slashing. I could go on for days about how great this game is but honestly If you like RPG games with a lot of loot, a challenge and a great story then you'll love Origins.			",214,9,5,23,6,0,17

												This game is one of the best RPG's in existence. It has a diverse cast of characters, each with their own unique look and personality. As the main character, you get to pick your race (human, dwarf, or elf), completely customize your appearence and skill set, and choose between several origin stories (hence the name of the game) for your character. Based on what you choose, NPC's have different reactions towards you. You can also recruit many companions throughout your travels, each packaged with their own backstory and personal quests. The voice acting in the game is pretty amazing. Each companion and major plot line character has a voice that is unique to them and easily recognizable.Gameplay is great as well. While on easier difficulties, you can take whoever you want with you, click on an enemy, and easily win, it is far more complex on higher difficulties. The game uses a tactics system that makes your companions use their abilities to react to certain conditions. On a high difficulty, it is necessary to balance out your companions abilities and tactics to ensure that you will be ready for even the strongest of enemies. If you don't have good balance or don't plan your battles, you will likely be easily destroyed.As far as graphics go, I will admit that this game isn't the best looking (but hey, it's five years old now, so it's pretty easy to overlook, and the other aspects of the game more than make up for it). However, Bioware has made this game easily moddable so there are many mods out there that can completely transform this game. I don't even know how many I have installed, but it's a lot! Overall, this game is just a fantastic RPG with decent graphics, great story, unique characters, amazing voice acting, complex gameplay, and an amazing modding community. If you like RPGs and haven't played this yet,  THEN GET OFF YOUR BUTT AND GET THIS GAME.  ",117,13,1,28,4,0,3

												A+With dialogue options that determine storyline and character outcomes and a combat system which allows you to manage and direct each party member individually (which is essential for group cohesion and maximum effectiveness) this is by far one of the best RPG's that I've played. The voice acting is one of the best I've seen in a game, not to mention party members converse with each other independent of the player controlling them resulting in entertaining and humorous banter while you explore. An amazing addition that I enjoyed the whole way through as it changes with each combination of characters you elect to your party. The cutscenes do not take away from gameplay, rather they aid in making the story more cinematic. Pros -  - Good story - Well-rounded combat system with party tactics, allowing player to manage all members as they see fit. - Dialogue choices affect outcome of relationships between player and companions as well as quests and storyline. - Incredible voice acting for all characters (except the player, whose character does not speak). - Professions and skills can affect combat and dialogue options. - Character background choices determine one of many intros to the main game making replay value more worthwhile than just builing a new spec.Cons -  - Maps seem a bit limited in exporability. - Character background, while providing variety, has only minor impact on game outcome, but interaction throughout is noticeably different.Overall: One of my top ten games. I definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys both RPG and fantasy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dragon Age: Origins wove a beautiful tapestry of a country torn apart by encroaching darkness, and interaction with your cadre of companions gives you a wide and deep appreciation of the effects of the Darkspawn rising as well as setting the scene for the Templar/Mage conflict of the second game. Your companions' offhand conversation over the course of the storyline adds amazing color, humor, and occasionally tenderness to both your relationship with them and their own feelings about each other. The combat system, although a little stilted, gives you an excellent range of specializations for your companions, allowing you to build a winning team that suits your personal style. Overall, the inception of this series drew me in as a fan for life. 9.5/10.			",15,4,0,2,1,0,1

												An absolute must-have for a fanatic Baldur's Gate lover such as me.Compelling storyline and great character development with tons of possibilities for dialogues, interactions and romances. A vast world full of lore and juicy politics, plots and intrigues. Elves and dwarves have an interesting social and political background which is a breath of fresh air from their usual depiction in classic fantasy. The player's choices, race, gender and abilities affect the plot so greatly that I felt the need of starting a new run with a different character even before completing the first one!But what amazed me the most was the feeling of pure EPICNESS I experienced in a lot of scenes and fights. I think it hadn't happened to me in a videogame ever before. I loved it.I recommend buying the full package with all DLCs because... Shale! The grumpy golem is hands-down one of the best characters in the game (and powerful too, with a unique fighting style and set of abilities).I think the word ""masterpiece"" can apply here :)			",2,8,0,2,0,0,0

												Dragon Age Origins is an addictive RPG with a very rich story. The characters are vibrant , especially the companion characters. Replay ability is immense, considering there are many different options that will change the 'epilogue' of the game. Awkenings as well has many different options you can take that will change the game's epilogue, and introduces some new interesting characters, and revisits a few as well. I HIGHLY endorse this game to anyone who enjoys RPGs especially those who enjoy fantasy based RPGs, or to anyone who likes games with story rich content.			",7,1,0,8,0,0,0

The story is strong through the whole game.Gameplay: much like Baldur's gate, it feels very fluid, but not as fluid as DA2 (I liked it, now i'm going to get hated).  Using spells is fun and most of the attacks are fun too.Graphics: I can't really do the graphics since it is an old game, but with mods it looks awesome.Sound: Voice acting is great and the soundtrack is AWESOME!!!Bottom_Line: Great game with a great company.  It is easy to understand and is really fun. 10/10 CCC Media MEDIA TO THE MAX!!! ",559,109,11,68,50,7,65

												Great game with good story, nice interaction and conversations but hard to get mechanics; extremely easy or impossible enemies, nothing in between. AI of party members is so stupid, random action would be better. Still a freakin' awesome game.			",161,24,8,25,32,1,39

												Great game with replay value. Depending on what race, class, and origin you pick, the world will react differently to you and you react differently to the world. Also, your party influences some options as well, but only minimally so.			",59,10,0,11,4,0,2

												Wow.  Just wow.  I had never played a game so immersive and interesting before now.  Dragon Age: Origins has created a monster.  I've always been a pretty casual gamer, but this game and its sequels have found me staying up literally all night to play them.  The story is well-written, the romances are heart-wrenching, and the characters feel so real.  Plus, the combat mechanics really agree with me.  11/10.  This game will always have a place in my heart.			",58,15,0,13,9,0,0

												This is quite possibly the best game I have ever plauyed. Imagine your Baldurs gate or your Neverwinter Nights, yet given the deep dialogue choices of your Mass Effect series. If this game comes up on sale and you have yet to play it, by all m,eans it is worth the money. If you are into RPG and tatical combat, this is most certainly the game for you. I love having so many chices and listening to how my friends played through this game since there are so many story options. Feel free to tweet me how you played things out in this game @jontheword.

												I may be one of the biggest RPG nuts around. I've played so many its hard to keep track of them all. That being said Dragon Age: Origins is probably in the top 10 Rpgs I've ever played. EVER. The story is fun and the characters are memorable. The lore that is established is incredible, especially for a game that's the first in what's hopefully a long series. The origins, the main story, and the seemingly meaning ful choices are what set this game apart.If you are familiar with Bioware games such as KOTOR, Baldurs Gate, and NWN then you know how the combat in this game works. If you don't, you need to know that combat is very strategic, and not exactly fast paced. If action packed, fast paced combat is your thing, you may want to skip this one. But if you enjoy strategizing and co-ordinating the skills of varied party members, this will go down as one of your favorites.The only cons I can think of are that there are no maps that you can just free roam on, and the cities that should seem like bustiling hubs actually feel pretty dead...This is an RPG in every since of the word, so understand that heavy story sequences, reading, and fairly large areas are all par for the course. There are plenty of things to do in the game and lots of secrets to go off and find. If you buy this game, have fun, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I have			",10,1,0,14,0,0,0

												Dragon Age Origins would be considered a spiritual successor to the late and great Bioware RPG known as Baldurs Gate. Both share a similar style of game play and similar style of story and design, though Dragon Age is far superior in terms of production value from its much older cousin-game Baldurs Gate. From amazing graphics (that still stand against most of todays games), to a compelling story line (that can be nearly fully customized despite the obvious fact it has to end), the music and even the sound effects - everything is crisp, clean, easy to run and not too hardware intensive. Set aside a few hours a week if you want to play this fast paced tactical RPG, you won't regret it.			",61,6,1,23,6,0,13

												DA:O is one of my favorite games of all time.  It has an engaging storyline, and the ability to communicate with your teammates is highly satisfying.  While some games claim that your decisions matter, most end up the same regardless, but I LOVE the way this game actually makes me feel like my decisions are affecting the world.  The different difficulty settings can appeal to hardcore or casual gamers, and with all the different classes and specializations, it is good for many different playthroughs.			",8,0,0,8,1,0,3

												This game has always been one of my favorites. The storyline is immersive and the characters only build to that feeling of realism. With a few addons, you can even play whichever gender you want and romance anyone. The class builds are clever, especially for rogue [though I've been told many times it's the most difficult class]. I would recommend this for the following -- Immerive storyline and characters- Class builds that challenge the player on higher difficulties- Different playthrough possibilities - Interesting origin stories for protags- Romance options [wink]- Hours of playtime			",20,7,0,12,4,0,0

												The dog is amazing!Oh, the game is pretty good too, frankly Bioware's finest. Great things from Bioware's older RPGs polished and maxed out while adding some good stuff from (back then in 2009) modern era.It's nearing 2017 and I still think Dragon Age: Origins has to be the best single player RPG ever made. If you're new to the game and its genre, the beginning might feel clunky and clumsy but hang on there. Once you get used to the UI and get the hang of the combat you wish the game would never end.

At least my family wasn't there.* Senpai noticed me <3* I saved a dog, got to keep it, and then spend two hours trying to find the perfect name for it. * Something involving Alice Cooper and Poison happened - I got better.* My new bff and I trolled a troll.* Senpai died :C* But at least I still had my dog....and then I spend around 400 years of my life groundhog daying that,  just to see if I'd rather have something other than a red wedding. Turned out I loved the rest of the game as well and have zero regrets about all the time I invested into this (which is about 2k hours all in all).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a warning, I'm not done with this game yet.This is a story-rich Roleplaying Game where you play as one of the last of an order of protectors fighting to save the world. The setting is a fantasy one with not too many departures from tropes. Characters are generally written well enough. You have a party with which you can develop a variety of relationships including romances. Combat plays like an MMO, but has some extra things that allow you to play more strategically.There's plenty of content and quests to do as well as things to explore in your character's journey.If you like Western RPGs this is well-made one with a story that has depth and a world filled with enemies to rid it of in your travels.

												[CONTAIN SPOILERS!] I got to make friends with a women encounted in a wild swamp and I got a pet war dog. Slaying monsters with a sword in each hand like boss and selecting the characters for my party based on who had best argumentative synergy just for laughs on the road. Spend time building an army to save the lands by making different groups & races love me, because I'm epic at slaying monster and a master of conversation! Shaping the world how I saw fit, making my friend marry his recently killed step-bother's widow in order to become king and when he thought I was going to stay at his side to help out I ran off into the sunset with my women and war dog - just after saving the world of the end times. 11/10 would recommend to a friend.[FREE OF SPOILERS]Now for a serious review: This is a game that I have played many times, each time as a different race, background and class and still today it stands as a excellent game for it's story, combat and is still decent graphically.Creator creation: There are 3 races (both genders), 3 classes (fighter, rouge and mage) and a number of different backgrounds (like Noble). The start of the game is different depending on your background and race which makes the game greatly more replayable. There is the normal customizability at the start for your character that you would expect, eye/hair colour, sound of voice, size of jaw line, character profile picture etc.Combat: Can pause the game during combat, issue commands to your party members or take direct control over them. Set up tatics for each party member, which is used by the AI when your not directly controlling them. Tatical camera gives you an overview of battles or if you would rather be close to the action you can zoom right in and watch all of the blood and gore of combat take place.Story: One of the most oringial, deep and epic that I've seen in a game which is set in a massive world (both in locations and lore). Different startings and many endings based on your actions means you end up with an experience very much unique to you. Like with many BioWare games, you can later import your saved data in the later games DA2 & DA:I (via Dragon Age Keep), which is great to see when playing the later games. The story also gives you the opportunity to often affect the ending (without you realising in most/some cases - if not your 1st time playing it), and even the smallest of quests at the start can lead to events later on in the game. You can easily spend 40-50 hours on a single playthrough if not more (first time on a non-steam version I played it, I spend over 100 hours)!Companions: There are some great companions that you encounter along the way which you would expect from BioWare. Although trying to please everyone to like you the most that they can is difficult as often your actions will gain favour with some and lose favour with others. Also you can get a pet war dog :) If you have never played a Dragon Age game, this is a great introduction to the series. If you have played the later games but not this one, I would recommend you play DA:O as it feels different from the others and one of the best games out there.11/10 would recommend to a friend.Just to state, I've played this game before on PC before buying on Steam with a game time ~400 hours.

												The characters of Dragon Age are memorable and the story is brutal and interesting. Gameplay of turn based combat is a lot of fun and strategic once you start understanding it. All of the main characters have fair amount of depth to them and they truly feel part of your team.The loot system and gears are varied and pretty cool. You can customize all of your characters in any way you can but a lot of the armors look way too similar and it gets boring to see legendary level armors and weapons that look the same as much cheaper ones.The setting of Dragon Age is both a strength and weakness. The places you go to are memorable and are visually amazing, but there just aren't that many places and they aren't big enough. You basically fast travel from one place to another, and the world doesn't feel big at all.Overall the fantastic story, well done characters and fun combat system definitely makes for a really fun game. The climax of the game also feels epic and hectic. Rating 85 ",48,6,2,5,1,3,5

												I didn't start to play this game until about a year ago (2015), moving to a new place without internet and my trusty 360 (I didn't think to use my laptop as a gaming maching at that point)... I than proceeded to spend the next 4-6 months playing through all possible endings and getting all the achievements (base game).However I stopped shy of getting every achievement cause at that point I was exhausted and needed to do something else... but even after getting the sequels and trying out a plethora of other console RPG's nothing would quite get close to Dragon Age Origins.So here I am... just recently bought this game again for the PC (while it was on sale mind you, but I had my finger on purchase for a while now)- and seeing and experiencing this game as it was meant to has given me a second wind.The Landsmeet awaits.

												So DAO is much better than DA2 or DAInq. What I just wrote is a fact. There is no way around it. If you liked either of the games I listed as worse than DAO, play DAO, now. My three favorite fantasy game series are Dragon Age, The Witcher, and The Elder Scrolls. I love fantastic worlds with lots of lore and factions that hate each other while crazy original (and unoriginal but look good) monsters run around providing you with quests to simply, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥up and get sexy gear and weapons to ♥♥♥♥ up uglier♥♥♥♥♥♥harder.The story is 10/10. (Bonus though the Warden's Keep, The Stone Prisoner, and Return to Ostagar are all add-ons that come with the Ultimate Edition that once downloaded are applied during the main campaign, they are all ♥♥♥♥ing sweet as hell.) DLC wise, which the Ultimate Edition comes with all of it, the (best waifu Morigan) Witch Hunt dlc was awesome to play through because she was my love interest during the game and I loved being able to choose if you follow that love or not after the events of the main game. The Golems of Amgarrak dlc is hard but a crap ton of fun. Now the Tales of Orzammar was meh, only mattered if your MC was dwarf so if you intend to play the full main story as dwarf then go ahead and do it, it’s basically a prologue of 40 minutes of play. The Darkspawn Cronicles and Leliana's Song are both meh as well, I didn't use Leliana during the campaign so it’s probably more interesting to those that want to learn more about how a priest became a thieving rogue while the Darkspawn Chronicles adds a chance to PLAY THE ♥♥♥♥ING DARKSPAWN! I KNOW RIGHT?!!?! Wrong. The dlc is an alternate storyline which is and never will be cannon but its cool to ♥♥♥♥ up humans with creepy♥♥♥♥♥creatures. (Protip for DC, get an ogre and run it into the explosive barrel holding darkspawn and it explodes without hurting your ogre but decimates everything.)DLC route (Cannon Route and best way to play them route):Main Game (which includes Warden's Keep, The Stone Prisoner, and Return to Ostagar add-ons in the story) -> Dragon Age: Awakening (bomb♥♥♥♥♥extra story and you get to build up a giant fortress and kill a very unique Darkspawn.) -> Golems of Amgarrak -> Witch Hunt (Don't be a♥♥♥♥♥♥to her she comes back in DA:I.)Basically, follow the above route and you will never hit any lore holes or bugs and you will have all the followers without any lore discrepancies (example doing Witch hunt allows you to make the main character disappear in a place for years which means Dragon Age Awakening (the only expansion) makes no sense because it is a couple months after the main story ends. Follow this ♥♥♥♥ing route. Trust me.(Protip: Do The Stone Prisoner dlc ASAP during the main game. Shale is a ♥♥♥♥ing beast and playing with a hilarious♥♥♥♥♥golem that smacks the everyliving♥♥♥♥ outta people is so enjoyable. To those minmaxers, great support that takes damage, the best at it other than if you load up the MC with sword and board.)You can load your progress into DA2 and then DA2 into DA:I or you can import what you did after finishing the campaign onto the website for story and load it into DA:I when starting in. Basically if you play origins and not 2, don't worry, just put what you did in the game into Dragon Age Keep (name of website) then load it in and all your choices and character deaths follow through.This game is easily 9/10 and for some reason the graphics got a lot better as the game progresses, weird but true. They aren't even bad and there are mods to make it look unreal but ♥♥♥♥ that.Also, if you are worried about paying and not getting value for it, my hours account for 1 main campaign, (100% I am proud to say.) and 1 play through of each DLC, the add-ons were installed as well to take into account hours for the main campaign. So yes, this game has a mc♥♥♥♥ton o' depth if you choose to dive in.TL;DR Quit being a♥♥♥♥♥♥and buy this damn game, it is worth every penny if not more. Get Shale. ♥♥♥♥ Morigan's brains out. The Templars always will be,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Also, add me if you buy it and read my review, I'll talk to you about the damn game as much as you want.			",58,8,0,17,5,0,3

												Wow.  Just wow.  I had never played a game so immersive and interesting before now.  Dragon Age: Origins has created a monster.  I've always been a pretty casual gamer, but this game and its sequels have found me staying up literally all night to play them.  The story is well-written, the romances are heart-wrenching, and the characters feel so real.  Plus, the combat mechanics really agree with me.  11/10.  This game will always have a place in my heart.			",58,15,0,13,9,0,0

												Recommended for any RPG fans and any fans of Bioware games.Story: Amazing and great.  The DLC adds so much more to the game.  The story is strong through the whole game.Gameplay: much like Baldur's gate, it feels very fluid, but not as fluid as DA2 (I liked it, now i'm going to get hated).  Using spells is fun and most of the attacks are fun too.Graphics: I can't really do the graphics since it is an old game, but with mods it looks awesome.Sound: Voice acting is great and the soundtrack is AWESOME!!!Bottom_Line: Great game with a great company.  It is easy to understand and is really fun. 10/10 CCC Media MEDIA TO THE MAX!!! ",559,109,11,68,50,7,65

												Bioware is one of the best developers of games in the industry right now. All of the games that I have played that have been made by them (Dragon Age series, Mass Effect series, and KOTOR series) are all up in my top 10 of games. Origins is such a great game that you can lose yourself in. I've put in over 300 hours into it and I'm still not done finding and defeating things. It's worth multiple playthroughs because there are so many outcomes. I would definitely recommend this game 10/10			",22,14,0,13,6,2,15

AUDIO: Nothing Special                                    AESTHETIC: ClassicMEMORABILITY: Expansive                              WORTH: DiscountPROS: Many hours of awesome, fantasy-driven story that will leave you invested. (Played console versions in entirety) Classes all have very different paths, giving DA high replay value. PC version runs well and looks great. Most of the lore is optional in info packs picked up from dialogue and items, meaning you won't be bored to tears or left out of the loop. You can go check out the plethora of information available to you when and if that suits you. Gameplay is very easy to pick up.CONS: Awakening is weak. No steam achievements despite achievements being available on console version. EA game means you're going to get some heckling from third parties, and you'll have keys to redeem. Couldn't seem to get controller working. Those who are expecting highly-technical gameplay to match the plethora of immersive writing will be disappointed.OVERALL: It doesn't break new ground, but it is a definitive title for what it is and is one of the most memorable ""stereotypical fantasy"" games to have come out in recent years. It is also very friendly to newcomers, making it a good toe in the water for people you want to introduce to the genre.                                                    SCORE: 8/10 ",309,150,6,54,38,3,41

												It's 2015 now, 5 years after the release of this game... (Well the steam release at least, i'm not going to bother looking up the official release date) And I still play this game... a lot. Despite Dragon Age: Origins spawning 2 sequels, I always find myself coming back to this one. The textures are bad, run speed is slow, combat takes a while to get engaging but this game is irrefutably the best game in the franchise. Gameplay wise it's extremely polish, allowing for multiple builds and adding new depths of difficulty. Every build has advantages and disadvantages, forcing players to think about where their next skill point should be placed. Dialogue is skippable and the choices are clear and concise, making it easy to judge what an NPC's reaction will be to your choice! However this RPG doesn't use a patronizing dialogue wheel that shows you pictures and says, ""This is the NICE option, This is the FUNNY option, This is the MEAN option, This is the option to kill yourself"", No, this game knows you're too smart for that and says, ""Here's the choices as to what your character will say, NOW ROLEPLAY"", Which is an EXTREMELY welcome change from the all too common ""Choose your prick"" gameplay style. - *cough* Dragon age 2 *cough* -  Story wise it's engaging , constantly forcing the warden to make critical choices that will ultimately affect the ending. Graphics wise it's not the BEST, it could be way better, but graphics never really mattered to me in the long run, and the UI looks really good. The characters and their animation can get comically bad sometimes, but it never gets ugly- *cough cough* Dragon Age 2 *Unconvincing cough* - and the charcter creator is a lot of fun. (I like making characters, don't judge my life choices, you're not my REAL mom!xD) All in all, Dragon age: Origins is a great game, well worth your time and money.			",54,9,0,12,9,0,2

												People usually say Skyrim: Elders Scrolls V was a revolutionary game! I say those people have never played Dragon Age: Origins,!!! This game has it all, graphics, storyline, action, drama, romance, there's a bit in the game for every kind of player. From those who wish to face on hordes of enemies, to those who like things more stealthily. However, none of these features were what attracted me the most to DA:O, I've always been an MMORPG kind of player, and DA despite not being an MMORPG can make you feel like you are in one, its party system lets you experience any class through your companions, despite having chosen a specific one for your character when you first created. It also brings that group work kind of feeling to the whole game, but you're the only one doing all the work, which in my opinion makes it all the most amusing. The combat pause system is something out of this world, something I had never experienced before DA:O and I must say, no other game that offers anything slightly similar to DA has ever pleased me as much, due to the lack of this ""game mode""...All in all, to me, this is probably the game of the last decade if not the game of this century, really a must for anyone wanting to try something classic yet revolutionary at the same time.

												When I first played this game I really didn't know what to expect. I had no idea what the story was or even the fact that it's RPG.It was on sale, and my friend gifted it to me. He said it was a good game. I left it there for few months..And then boom! I decided to give a try a few years ago, and I was soooooooooooooo into the game.I love how attached you could get towards the characters. They all have interesting backstory.I highly recommend this game if you actually want to immerse yourself into it, like you are really in the game.Don't compare it to any other game, just lose yourself in it like your in this ""world"".Almost of choice you make matters. It matters in the sequels too! ouo			",151,27,5,42,24,1,18

												The most exciting RPG, that follows the footsteps of the Baldur’s Gate-series. Bioware goes back to its roots, combining classical party-roleplay and tactical battles with a cinematic presentation that reminds to the Lord of the Rings-trilogy by Peter Jackson. The storytelling and the dialogues are fantastic, the sound effects are great and you’ll be deeply involved in the game within minutes. Though, the technical background isn’t state of the art. Lack of high textures and missing details in the surrounding level-area aren’t satisfying. But the grapichs still are not something to hate the gameplay, as it will take you in without a doubt. My all time favorite RPG!			",267,21,7,19,6,1,16

												9/10This game is a classic now. I first played it on my xbox 360 and I beat the game with probably 50 hrs (without the DLC). The storytelling is excellent and the character development is top notch. If you want an excellent story and you want to feel invested in the characters in a game, this is the game for you.I played Dragon age III  this year (We won't talk about the mess of DA II)  and although excellent in its own right, I still prefer this original game over it. I found the story more engaging in this first part, and for it's time, the game play was very innovative. If you haven't played this game and you are into RPG's, you owe it to yourself to give Dragon Age Origins a go. You won't be dissapointed.			",56,13,2,18,1,0,4

												Probably one of the best Stretegy based RPG games I've ever played. I enjoyed almost every aspect of the game such as the leveling and character development system. The storylines, combat and npc interaction was also spot on as well. While this may not be the most fantastic looking game visually it more than makes up for it in sheer content and playing time. I also enjoyed quite a few playthroughs of this game(I previously owned it on console) and each time it never got dull and always impressed upon playing again. All in all I would recommend this game to anyone who is interested in games of this type as it really is a staple of how good games of this genre can be. 85/100			",94,10,1,9,7,0,9

												A simply amazing game.Like many of BioWare's titles, Dragon Age offers a deep and enriching story filled with interesting characters, intriguing lore and unforgettable moments.The main story is quite long, taking me 50+ hours to complete. There is a huge amount of content and large amounts of replayability due to the branching and dynamic storyline. The 'Origins' part of the game - where you choose and play out your background, as well as your own actions and choices - really helps define your character, making them feel unique and personal.While the 'pause and play' style of combat can be slow and repetitive, it's tactical and (most of the time) places you on your toes.With an interesting world, lore, story and characters, Dragon Age Origins is an enthralling experience that will grip you untill it's very last moments----- Potentially Slight Spoilers -----I personally found the last 'boss fight' to be really underwhelming, especially with all the hype and tension placed on you throughout the story. Maybe it was due to the setup or skills that my party had but I personaly found that final battle quite easy.			",217,40,3,34,18,0,38

												This game is amazing just what you expect from bioware. The graphics hold up really well in 2017 and the voice acting is top quality for the most part until you hear some normal soldiers talk and that can sometimes lead to some cring worthy moments.gameplay is in real time but not like the newer dragon age games more like balder's gate and pillars of eternity style combat system but what those games don't have is the 3D enviroments with the beautifull and gory animations. It's tactical and deep and you can make some pretty crazy builds and can be very helpfull in batlle and keep it fresh for multiple playthroughs, you have some great flexibility in the classes in this game.The armor and weapons are just amazing, you really start out with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MMO style gear but when you start hitting lev 10 and beyond the variation is just breathtaking just look up some armor pieces and weapons and you will know what i'm talking about. the story is for me personally the best of all the dragon age games because it reminds me a lot of Game Of Thrones. It has many moments that will hit you with twists and turns and most of all shocking deaths that you can control at some points but mostly is out of your hands.What sell this game and makes it so original above all the other dragon age games or Other RPG's in general is the ""origins"" in the titel. Yes, you have the choice to choose between 6 different (origin) stories depending if you are a human. elf or dwarf. This means above the main story that revolves around the darkspawn invasion, you get your own personal backstory that you actually take part in at the beginning and throughout the story will be faced with actions that will determin not only your Origin story but the faith of the main story as well. This is trully an amazing game and i still hope that in the future Bioware wil make another dragon age game with the origins style storytelling but with the newer combat and class systems.9/10.Sidenote: played over 100 hours on ps3 so yeah my review is legit and yes the PC version is FAR superior than the console version.

												This is a great game considering it's age (unintentional pun). It's main positives would be it's massive amount of possible quests and unique npc interaction, it does a very good job in creating a real story that gets you hooked (which is something i have to come to constantly expect from bioware). But every games has it's faults, the battle and fighting system is very slow paced and boring to take part in (this is something that the second installment fixed) and some classes mainly the mage, dual weapon rouge and/or warrior are quite unbalnced, this is as with a dual weapon user can breeze through a massive amount of eneimies with ease, but the mage will struggle with it's lack of health and resistances (unless you are some sort of god). This is especially clear in the early parts of the game such as the tower of magi where going solo through it can really f**k you up, I myself have become infuriated at the amount of damage (or lack of) a single mage will put out when going through the game, whereas the npc's such as a well equiped zevran and alistair can melt eneimes, and in this alistair will also take zero damage being a tank. This is most apparent with the dlc of DAO as the OP equipment you recieve from it give characters like alistair and zevran a huge powerstrike. (first detailed review plz no hate). Overall a good introduction to the game, where combat lacks story flourishes, the oppisite for DA2, but then brought to a balance of both aspects in the third game DA Inqusition.			",73,9,0,11,4,0,4

												Dragon Age: Origins - Ultimate Edition is an RPG with a massive world to explore and a very elaborate fighting system to master.Fight mythical beasts such as Dragons, Orcs, Trolls, Zombies and Demons! Your path will be soaked in blood...but you will learn to like the feel of guts between your toes.The storyline changes everytime you play depending on who you are and what your choices and actions are.You have complete freedom on how to develop your character and party.You will never play the same game twice.10/10			",176,8,2,13,3,3,8

												Dragon Age Origins is an archetype descended from Tolkien that's been done so many times before, and better, but is still competent enough to have fun playing, despite its many flaws. As always, Bioware has created an expansive, engaging world, and as always, exploring that world and creating an identity within it take a backseat to being the Savior of Humanity. As well crafted and compelling as the personal origin stories are, each is quickly redirected for the player to become The Chosen One, and then lays out a mostly predetermined path through Ferelden. While it is possible to choose which towns to be the Savior of Humanity at in which order, every decision and battle is done first and foremost as a Grey Warden. The graphics are a trough slop of jaggedness, stiffness, and clipping, and the music is a mostly forgettable blend of generic Fantasy songs. Gameplay is a party-based, real-time, Fantasy RPG which can be paused mid combat to issue commands. Party AI can be organized through the tactics screen, but characters will still need to be micromanaged lest they slip into their favorite pastime, posing dramatically on the battlefield while everyone around them is slaughtered. Nightmare difficulty mode was challenging enough to remain interesting, even into the later stages of the game, though I imagine lower difficulties would be less engaging. And sadly, it doesn't take much looking to find EA's tacky profiteering, but that is no fault of Bioware's.It is the storytelling that shines as DAO's real strength, and while not a word of it escapes from standard Fantasy tropes or clichés, it still remains very competently constructed. There are pages and pages of historical text, so as not to disappoint the furious people who thought they were installing a book rather than a game, but there is also strong characterization and voice acting in the companions, despite the awkward way they stare and move in conversations, like wooden puppets occasionally struggling against their strings for freedom. As per Bioware standard, the player may interact with the characters of Ferelden through helpful, self-interested, or for some reason, bewilderingly pissy conversation options.There are some non spoiler elements I really wish I’d known going into the game that I shall list here to spare others from my mistakes. Firstly, there are locked chests EVERYWHERE. Cunning is required to unlock these chests, aided by the Rogue talent, Deft Hands. Without a rogue with high cunning in the party, easily half of the loot in the game is forfeited. Secondly, cunning is required to access many dialogue and story options, aided by the Coercion skill. Many choices are simply unavailable without cunning, but since only the cunning of the player’s character counts for these checks, and cunning is only useful as a combat stat for Rogues, the player must either choose a melee Rogue, take a large hit to combat effectiveness, or forgo several story options throughout the game.Coddle the warden’s teammates! Mirror their opinions in conversations and make all decisions in the world based on which characters are currently in the party. This desperate bid for a follower’s approval directly affects their stats, and if the player’s popularity drops too low, their followers will simply walk away, impending apocalypse be damned. Remember that DAO isn’t about exploration or curiosity, and tiptoe carefully around the judgmental fragility of teammates whenever the temptation to pursue something interesting arises, or risk losing a group member, their role in the party, and all their god damned gear.DON’T RECRUIT THE DOG!!! I cannot stress this enough. Once the dog has been recruited, nearly every conversation initiated at camp will be competing with its loud barking, and there’s no option to remove it from the party or throw it into a volcano. For those players who want to catch every detail of interaction between characters, this dog is the quickest route to panic attacks.Lastly, while it is possible to romance certain companions with the typical, cutesy exchange of quips and cleverness, even mundane interactions with them can make the game assume something is going on. After telling Zevran it didn’t bother me that he stared at me, people starting referring to us as an item. In the epilogue, it said that he mourned my loss, and while he took many other partners to bed, he never loved again. I had maybe three conversations with that elf… ",35,4,0,7,0,0,1

												This is a great game considering it's age (unintentional pun). It's main positives would be it's massive amount of possible quests and unique npc interaction, it does a very good job in creating a real story that gets you hooked (which is something i have to come to constantly expect from bioware). But every games has it's faults, the battle and fighting system is very slow paced and boring to take part in (this is something that the second installment fixed) and some classes mainly the mage, dual weapon rouge and/or warrior are quite unbalnced, this is as with a dual weapon user can breeze through a massive amount of eneimies with ease, but the mage will struggle with it's lack of health and resistances (unless you are some sort of god). This is especially clear in the early parts of the game such as the tower of magi where going solo through it can really f**k you up, I myself have become infuriated at the amount of damage (or lack of) a single mage will put out when going through the game, whereas the npc's such as a well equiped zevran and alistair can melt eneimes, and in this alistair will also take zero damage being a tank. This is most apparent with the dlc of DAO as the OP equipment you recieve from it give characters like alistair and zevran a huge powerstrike. (first detailed review plz no hate). Overall a good introduction to the game, where combat lacks story flourishes, the oppisite for DA2, but then brought to a balance of both aspects in the third game DA Inqusition.			",73,9,0,11,4,0,4

												A party based RPG with an optional RTS/Tactical element of zooming far out and getting a better view of the field. You can pause the game and issue orders to your party at will, giving you time to think and plan ahead, especially in the tougher battles. The game has a tactics system you can set up for each party member that works similarly to gambits in Final Fantasy XII. For example: Ally Health <50% - Use Ability: Heal, and so on. You can unlock more tactics slots by leveling up, and also by spending a skill point for even more slots.It's a quality RPG with a rich story, oceans of codex, and MMO driven combat by Bioware. Dragon Age: Origins has loads to do in the main campaign alone, let alone the expansion it comes with.Unfortunately the game was coded like a potato, causing the game to chug like a drunk fratboy due to memory leaks unless you reboot the game every hour or so.Technical issues aside and only one crash so far, it runs stable enough.

												Dragon Age, the classic game brought to you by the makers of Mass Effect, KOTOR and Jade Empire. Certainly better than its half arsed sequal after EA ♥♥♥♥ed Bioware into a shell of its former self. You are the grey warden and you'll be going on a quest to save the entire realm from darkness... yeah it's pretty much the typical good must triumph over good story, nothing really original but still interesting nonetheless. You'll battle creatures like the undead, dark monsters, and surprisingly a few dragons. This is Biowares classical style of game, where the main character is a mute and there's a lot of detail to the world you inhabbit. I do prefer Dragon Age 2's voice acting and some of the characters, however in this game when you make a character from the start you have the freedom to make a human, elf or a dwarf and a choice of different backgrounds to start the story from. Whether you want to be a human noble or an Elf ranger, as well as the choice of class for your character, of which it is limited to 3: Warrior, Rogue and Mage. It would have been better if there were more of a variety of classes like the Elder Scrolls, or even their own game Mass Effect which has sci-fi rpg classes of about 6.Dragon Age: Origins is a must have if you are an RPG nut and you like fantasy worlds inhabbited by Elves and Dwarves.

												The game is great, but it suffers from many issues that cause great annoyance. It's not a gigantic roadblock, and there haven't been any game breaking moments. But I've heard from my friends there are some rather annoying workarounds required should some stages get bugged.So, whilst the game is great, the developers never cared to fix the critical bugs the game has, which is a bummer. It doesn't prevent me from recommending the game, as it is superb, but if you are low on patience with games, you might want to leave this one aside, as it has bugs that have no excuse not to be fixed.

												Dragon Age---Companions done right. My go back to game has always been the Fallout games. But I was always disappointed that F3 and NV would not allow multiple companions at a time, F4 even more restrictive. But this game not only allows you to pick more than one or two companions at a time, but also has them interact with each other.  And that is the most fun part. You will be traveling along, then in the background hear your companions just carrying on a conversation.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For the past decade, Bioware has been heralded as the undisputed king of roleplaying games, largely because of a single game: Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn. Those who have experienced the tale need no explanation, but for those whose gaming histories are lacking, I shall say simply that Shadows of Amn is quite definitively the quintessential title of the entire roleplaying genre. The success of Shadows of Amn fueled Bioware to develop the massively successful Star Wars: Knights Old Republic, Neverwinter Nights and its many expansions, Jade Empire, and more recently Mass Effect. Sadly, none of Bioware's subsequent titles managed to fully recapture the raw quality of gaming present in Shadows of Amn. So it was that when Bioware began to bill their latest RPG, Dragon Age: Origins as the spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate, we stood up, and we took notice.Dragon Age: Origins appears to offer us exactly what we wanted—a return to the depth of gameplay we found in Shadows of Amn. Bioware promised us deep gameplay, a strong and compelling narrative, unique characters, absurd quantities of side-quests and banter and content of all kinds. The question we are now faced with is this: did Bioware deliver on its promises?As is often the case with such things, our answer is both yes and no. Dragon Age: Origins offers a stronger gameplay mechanic, more content, and better writing than nearly any other ""Western"" roleplaying game in the past decade. To be perfectly honest, the only other game that even begins to approach the depth and character of Bioware's latest title is CD Projekt Red's phenomenal RPG, The Witcher. In some places, Dragon Age: Origins manages to succeed the standard set by Baldur's Gate, yet in others it falls short. Nevertheless, gamers looking for a strong, immersive RPG experience need look no further than Dragon Age: Origins, which is rapidly taking its place as one of the best fantasy titles produced after Bioware killed off the Infinity Engine nearly one decade ago.Dragon Age: Origins is by no means a perfect game, or another ""quintessential"" example of the genre. It has its faults and its faults are many, but it also has its own, unique charm. And make no mistake: Dragon Age is most-certainly one of the very best games we have seen in a very, very long time.			",173,91,2,76,16,0,55

												You start the original campaign by creating your character. You can choose from three different races (dwarf, elf, or human) and three different roles (mage, rogue, or warrior). This gives you eight (no dwarven mages) combinations to choose from. You can also choose from different social backgrounds depending on which race you picked. I played a dwarf casteless warrior. Regardless of how you make your character, events will eventually lead to you being the one who has to unite all of the races to fight the darkspawn invasion. The storyline is fairly common, but well-written. It requires you to deal with the tensions and politics between and within the races for much of the campaign.  Another interesting aspect of the game is some of the difficult choices you will encounter. The consequences of your choices will influence future events in game and the final outcome. For example, you will have the option of recruiting a warrior who murdered a family to help you deal with the darkspawn or leaving him in a cage to die. The combat is real time. You can pause it and select different characters, make them use different abilities, or use different items. The game features a tactics system that will make each character use certain abilities in certain situations. You can modify the tactics use or disable them completely. I opted to disable tactics since the default settings for some characters were pretty annoying. Some characters will use abilities at times that are inconvenient.Each class features an interesting variety of talents for each class. There are passive talents and talents that give your characters additional abilities.  If you play a warrior, you can use talents that support a sword and shield build, a dual-wielding build, or a build that requires a two-handed weapon.The difficulty is appropriately tuned overall. I played on normal difficulty setting. The difficulty scaled well with the endgame encounters being more difficult overall than the rest of the game. This game has some technical issues. There are invisible walls. In some places, your characters can’t walk up stairs. They have to run up them. There were a few exploits to be used. For some encounters, I could stand at max range with a mage, hit enemies with normal attack, and they would not react.The Awakening Expansion features a new storyline, a new territory, adds new abilities to the existing ones, and mostly new characters. You can either import your character from Origins or create a new one.The story of Awakening features a little more mystery than its predecessor. It’s quite good and, in my opinion, better than the story line in Origins. It features some fascinating choices that I won’t reveal because of spoilers.The rest of the expansion doesn’t feature as many side quests and storylines as the original. It took me 42 hours to complete Awakening compared to 94 for Origins. The difficulty seems to be easier in Awakening. Enemies don’t always scale to the level of your party. My warrior tank felt unkillable since he took very little damage.Overall, Origins features a good storyline and strong role-playing elements which make it a game worth playing. This combined with the story in Awakening is why you should get Ultimate Edition.			",8,4,0,13,0,0,1

Posted: November 9, 2015
												I really hesitated to write this review, because so many people have told me (and will probably tell you) that Dragon Age: Origins is one of the greatest games ever made. I don't think it is. But it's still a great game and worth picking up at the full retail price (a rare thing in itself!).So what's good? Story, characters. BioWare is famous for both; Dragon Age Origins is one of the games that sustained that reputation. Choices have REAL consequence; alternatives have different outcomes, not the same outcome with different dialog. Music is superb, and though dated, the game still looks awesome (mods can help). Upgrade trees are deep and varied. There is a ton of loot and side-quests. The world of the game is huge (even though it's actually dozens of smaller hub-worlds). And the different races each come with their own scripted origin stories that you actually play through (instead of just having a wall of text to read).So... (start scary music) what's – dare I say it – bad? Subjectively (not objectively), my primary issue is the combat. I know what you're thinking. “Another FPS dummy who can't understand tactics! Dood hates to think when he games. Go have fun with mindless drivel, Dragon Age Origins is for REAL gamers.” Trust me, I've heard plenty of the hate. Hear me out, though. I've played this game using multiple methods and techniques – my playtime numbers indicate the amount of time I've devoted to figuring this game out. I leveled my characters with deep (highly developed) specializations, not trying to put points into everything, and didn't neglect my passives. I brewed potions and oils, created traps and explosives. Had plenty of Health poultices and Lyrium potions on hand. I balanced my party with: one “tank” (i.e. a damage sponge), one healer, and one that fights from a distance (I preferred another mage). And I took pains over my party tactics. Tactics are the default actions your AI squad-mates take. The learning curve is steep here, but after some trial and error, this is one of the keys to successful combat. Once combat is initiated, your squad-mates will attack whatever the tactics dictate they should attack. Failing that, they will attack whatever enemy you are fighting. Sounds good. Frequently, though, a character will have more skills than tactics slots. So the only way to use that skill in battle is to pause the action, select the squad-mate, and manually execute the command. If you don't want to die – A LOT – pausing isn't a feature to be occasionally utilized; it becomes a requirement in order to survive. Pausing the game occasionally is fine, but once it becomes an integral part of the combat, a few things happen:1. Gameplay starts to feel choppy, with a constant go-stop-go-stop-go feeling.2. Because of the above, there isn't any real flow to the combat. 3. Battles stretch out way too long. Given the length of some missions – like the Deep Roads – that's potentially hours spent going through one region. The alternative I found is to play the game (mostly) in real time, with a few pauses here and there to issue specific orders for specific bosses. This prohibits me from ramping up the difficulty level. Normal is more like Hard when played in this manner. Orange-lettered bosses take forever to fall. But the gameplay flows better and the story progresses much more quickly. The combat isn't ""bad"" per se; just awkward and choppy for those (like me) who don't want to manage every detail of a combat situation.Dragon Age Origins is a great adventure, no question, with some of the best writing, choices and characters that have ever graced a video game. If that's what appeals to you, go ahead and purchase it, you'll love it. If you love “classic” turn-based RPG combat, you'll probably love the game even more. Some micro-managing required. On DLC:Get the Ultimate Edition, or don't buy the game. There is a lot of DLC, and the Ultimate Edition bundles it all up in one tidy package. An account on social.bioware.com is required to access and download your DLC, though.			",308,121,22,53,56,2,74

												12/15 Stars. RPG.If you want a good Role-Play-Game to sink your teeth into, start with Dragon Age Origins. The immersive world will suck you in and leave you wondering just which of your companions you want to bonk.Pros: - Interesting Story - Fleshed Out Characters - Well paced combat - Plenty of contentCons: - The first hour or so of the game is a bit of a slog, but once you press on it's more enjoyable. - Exploration was done oddly. Has a map and you auto-travel around it by clicking, and then you come across random encounters which feel like forced time-extension to the game. - Reused areas			",367,77,4,53,39,2,67

												8.5/10 One of the best strategy games I have ever played, if we are not counting Total War games then this would be the best strategy game I have ever played. (if i remember them all)Dragon Age: Origins - Ultimate Edition has many storylines and the combat system is perhaps slower than some would prefer because of the need to pause to give comands throughout a fight. I personally like the feature. The graphics are able to be crap or awesome depending on your PC needs so dont worry about having a weak computer, you can play Dragon Age regardless of your PC.There are some parts of the lore that drive me nutts that I would like to change; but I cant go changing portions of a game now can I? I would say that despite the occasional glitch and the fact that the game is rather difficult at times it is good for all ages. Screw whatever the ""official"" rating is I can see anyone 12+ playing this game and enjoying it, provided they are not too stupid to play the game.This game also has many mods on the Nexus as well as the Nexus Mod manager compatability.

Personal Rating: Buy on summer sale if you like lengthy RPGs with a whole bunch of lore to appreciateTraditional Rating: 6.5/10 maybe higher, but not lowerCan't promise this will be spoiler free (it's not), but I'll do my best (spoilers are hidden behind spoiler bars).If You're Going to Buy DLC...Return to Ostagar provided some closure that the original game didn't.Soldiers's Keep or whatever it's called added some lovely lore to the whole Grey Warden business.Shale's expansion is okay if you like the dwarves and want to know more about the golems. Plus the new areas are very pretty. Those who hate birds will share a very special bond with our miniature golem.Awaken wasn't really worth it, in my opinion. If it goes on sale, maybe. Was basically DA:O but with different characters and a thousand-breasted slug monster instead of a dragon.Feastday Gifts is not worth your time or money; cheap way of gaining character affection that loses its novelty very quickly.Whatever the version where you can play as darkspawn is was fun, never finished it because holy crap is it difficult and yet gets boring at the same time.Where did that 3.5 go?The Mage's Circle Quest (2.0):There's actually a mod which removes it from the game[www.nexusmods.com] because it's so lengthy and repetitive and annoying and I just want to get on with the story please let me out of The Fade! Seriously, Bioware,  if people are modding a whole 2 hours of gameplay out of a game, you messed up.Main Character (0.0):S/he serves as a foil for the other (much more interesting) characters. I understand wanting to let the player throw their own personality on to a character, but if you're okay with giving the character a backstory, give them a personality. Only one I can see being appropriate in not having a personality is if you went with the mage route. Since this is a minor, quib, I didn't make it count towards the overall rating I gave.Choices (1.0):In terms of actual choices (aside from some dialouge choices and one choice), they all boiled down to being excessively nice to please Alistair or unnecessarily mean to humour Morrigan. Something that Might Bother Other People (0.0):The combat has tactical view with the ability to pause mid-fight. I found it wasn't necessary until closer to the end (then again, I was playing on easy because I'm horrible at these kinds of games), but it does a fantastic job of interrupting the flow in combat.Minor Grumbles (0.5):The ""love-making"" scenes were rather immersion-breaking. Seriously, I have never seen something as gratuitous as sex for sex's sake used well in a game - it's like you're listening to someone read The Return of the King to you and suddenly they switch to... say 50 Shades of Grey. Thankfully, these can be avoided as long as you don't mind hurting any characters' feelings. THIS IS A SPOILER, if you still read it, that's your own fault. When you go to kill the Archdemon at the end of the game, Alistair will insist on sacrificing himself if your character is a lady and friends/more with him and you didn't complete the ritual with Morrigan. While I understand that sacrificing himself for a friend is totally in his character, he doesn't do this for the male mains, (regardless of how close he is to them) and I wanted my moment of sacrifical glory; gosh dangit, stop stealing the spotlight from me you royal bugger!. On the topic of characters and their feels, the dialogue becomes some sort of delicate political dance where you say one thing but it ends up meaning something that you definitely did not mean to say. Also, the game way overstayed its welcome. 72 hours for one playthrough - and it was my second time through (on easy)! A fair amount of that was unecessary padding; could probably have made it 40 hours and still gotten as much out of it.Dragons:What the heck is up with the rock music in the trailers and the emphasis on dragons? There were four dragons and two of them weren't in the main story and one of the ones in the main story was Morrigan's mother! It did add to the whole large-scale awe of fighting one though. It didn't end up turning dragons in to barbeque lighters with wings.The Part Where I'm NiceCharacter Dialogue:I would have bought this game just for the background dialogue between main characters. I picked my parties in-game for the background dialogue (Zevran, Morrigan, Alistair/Sten, and Wynne; I was a rogue), I spent hours trying to figure out how to trigger party banter and eventually downloaded a mod that increased the amount of times banter started. Bioware definitely knows how to flesh out characters when they want to.Lore:You know that feeling when you want to find and read all the possible history of the universe you're playing in? Yeah I got that feeling while I was playing this game. While there are a few subtle rewards for understanding the basic lore, I can only think of a couple examples where digging deeper had any payoff. I can understand they didn't want to alienate players who don't read a lot, though, so that's okay.Conversation:I know the choices don't all matter in the end, but they certainly feel like they do at the time and those little nods to events later in-game really do make them feel more important. Not to mention I got way more enjoyment out of pestering Sten with endless questions than I should have.All in all a fun game that I managed to sink 72 hours in to - and that's only counting my second full playthrough. First one was not with a steam copy, so I would estimate around 160+ hours have been spent on this game. Flaws didn't hugely detract from the fun to play factor.			",65,24,0,9,3,0,9

												I have tried to get into this game pretty much since it came out, but to no avail. I adore Bioware's Mass Effect, but it seemed like no matter how many playthroughs I gave Origins, I still wasn't going to be charmed in the same way I was with ME. But finally, on probably my sixth or seventh attempt at completing the game, I fell in love with it!I'd definitely say this is a title you have to mod- the vanilla graphics are, well, 2009, and the gameplay has some rather frustrating design flaws that might leave new players feeling aggravated. But Nexus has everything you need to make the game shine as much as it possibly can, so I would recommend a stop there before firing up a new game. The gameplay is extremely well thought out and flexible to different play types. Lower difficulties combined with god mods will turn it into almost a hack and slash- a good choice if you're here for the story but aren't a fan of the sometimes difficult gameplay. Higher difficulties offer an almost turn based sort of battle chess, which is loads of fun because there's an endless number of combinations of spells and attacks that can be combined for added damage and unique effects. Each character can receive a maximum of twenty five combat tactics slots, which can be set with extremely detailed parameters, making automating party member behaviour a breeze. If you're a fan of older JRPGs or tabletops, you'll have a ton of fun with the gameplay in this. Character creation is extraordinary, and definitely will not leave you feeling class locked. It's a very nuanced system that allows for growth right up until the end of the game. I played as a Mage, a class I normally would not pick because I prefer melee classes. However, the game offers the option to further specialize in two subclasses at level 7 and 14, which allowed me to create highly offensive mage that could use both magic and melee weapons with equal strength. You can make some truly unique players, and the armor/weapons add even more depth to the system, as they grant perks and can be modified as well. The story, I'm sure it goes without saying, is pretty damn good. You'll feel a bit like the errand boy of Ferelden instead of a warrior dedicated to slaying demons at times, but the pay off for most of the quests is good enough to make the slower parts worth it. The characters are lovable and the dialogue well written and voice acted. It's darker and grittier than Mass Effect, which I really liked, and has some truly memorable moments. As usual with Bioware games, player choice affects the game world, and I feel like this game has perhaps the best range of good/neutral/evil options of any of their games. Outcomes are pretty unpredictable and some of the decisions and negotiations actually made me stop and think for a moment. tl;dr Mass Effect but dark fantasy, mod it, play it, probably love it.

												I have 147 hours logged into this game, and I have not beat it yet. I have not even come close to beating it yet. When I first purchased this game it was on PS3 and I rushed through the story in about 80 hours, now that I have a PC and can dedicate the time to playing EVERYTHING in the game, it's taken be 147 hours to just get out of the starting areas. This game along with Mass Effect 2 are Bioware's crowning achievements and best contributions to the RPG genre.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I mean, what is there to say that hasn't already been said?  The characters are amazing, the gameplay is...alright.  The story's not ORIGINAL, but it is still VERY good.  All-in-all, this game gets a 9/10.  Here's the breakdown:Writing: 10/10.  I thought this game was fantastically well-written with each character having distinct characteristics, likes, dislikes, and just general likability.Music: 8/10.  It's got good music, but none of it is memorable to me.  It sorta sits in the background, which I guess is its purpose, but you also don't find yourself humming any of the songs when you're trying to sleep at night.Gameplay: 9/10.  Solid, but trite.  It's been done.  Raise your numbers so you do more numbers and those numbers help you find arbitrary gear that raises your numbers more.  If you're into this sorta thing (I am, so very much), then it's gold.Story: 9/10.  Like I said, the story's been done before.  Lone hero has to save the world from an unspeakable evil by slowly gathering an army about him, one group at a time.  That being said, the story's kept fresh with some fantastic writing and excellent worldbuilding.			",49,7,0,24,3,0,5

												This is the first game I've played in this series (haven't played any of the Baldur's Gate games). I have however, played similar games in the past. This game begins pretty slow but grew into something much more than I thought it would become. The party members are all dynamic and interesting and will leave you cursing the 4 members limitation. The quests are usually not that deep but the combat system and the character interactions are amazing. Graphics aren't anything extraordinary but there are some mindblowing views at certain sections of the game. Randome encounters when travelling from one city to another can get annoying at times. The different in-game guilds do not really make you feel like you're a part of the guild (unlike the assassins brotherhood and the thieves guild in Skyrim which made you feel like a true member). While the dungeons are pretty varied and interesting, the main cities themselves are usually extremely small and not very interesting to explore. Combat can at times get overwhelming with the large number of skills and many of which are usually repetitive. The DLC is pretty decent and grants some useful skills and items to your party members. Overall, it is a pretty good game, definitely overrated but still worth playing.8/10			",134,12,1,20,8,0,6

												First off this game is amazing, even though its starting to show its age. I have played all three versions of this game, Xbox360, PS3, and now on PC. Its a no brainer, PC is the best version of this game hands down! Graphically It looks alot better on PC, of course, most of the game looks way better and the menu selection/navigation is a joy compared to the barf console version. The gameplay and the controls on the PC are what make you wonder why they even bothered with the clunky garbage console setup, but money talks. The UI is setup more like a MMORPG with hotbars for ease of play. WASD is friendly territory for movement ect. ect. but It actually feels like a refined version of the old Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic engine. Spacebar is defaulted as the ""pause"" button for more accurate tactical choices, easy awesomeness. Play this game on PC if you can! Even if you have played the console versions! Its like a whole new experience! Yes, the Ultimate Edition works with all the content straight from the download! Cheers STEAM!			",81,16,0,39,3,0,8

												Its the best game for your dollar, I recomend it for people who like a great storyline with witty characters. The battle style takes a few to get used to, but other than that, its a must have game. Im quite addicted to it!:Edit:I have played close to 100 hours on it, and i still feel as if i have yet to hit all of the storys. The ending can change depending on what choices you have made so far up untill the ending. I liked how the groups you can fight with at the end, you can change. Elves VS Werewolves. Dwarfs VS Golems. Templars VS Mages. If you have beat the game, you know what i am talking about. If you have yet to beat the game, i recommend that you do!The awakening part of the game, well it could have been better. It was still fun, but maybe its because i dont have the nitch for politics, that everyone hated me in the end, when i tried doing the best i could. The ending of Awakening, was a bit stale, but im still glad i played it for the insite of the chars ill be with in Dragon Age 2.Most people say they dont like it because of ""the art style"" or ""bad graphics"" or maybe you ""got bored"".. Well to all of those people out there i say, how are you a gamer. The art style im sure was great back >>>When The Game Was Made<<< but to live up to the newer games? Thats a good chunk of time difference there my friend. If your getting bored playing it, then your not a RPG player. I like the RPG games, where it takes you hours to complete, if you ever to complete it. Maybe your just another FPS, stick to those if you like mind numbing shootouts. (No offence) But frankly, you must not like playing something that requires you to think, Or that if you have beer with it you cant just butten spam and be done with it. THIS IS NOT THAT TYPE OF GAME. There said it. Now before all you people out there want to go and throw a hissy fit because i just ""insulted you"". Im not saying you are all drunks, or that you all are stupid. I stated that before so those who that applies to can shoo. If you are the type who likes RPG games, but didnt like this game, for what ever reason, then the more to you. Im not trying to insult you guys, just the ones who have no sence in reviews. Some games just arnt for some. For those of you thinking of buying this game, i say, go for it, if you are unsure because of a Neg review that had thought put behind it, then wait for a sale, and try it then.			",43,16,1,6,3,0,0

												This is the first game I've played in this series (haven't played any of the Baldur's Gate games). I have however, played similar games in the past. This game begins pretty slow but grew into something much more than I thought it would become. The party members are all dynamic and interesting and will leave you cursing the 4 members limitation. The quests are usually not that deep but the combat system and the character interactions are amazing. Graphics aren't anything extraordinary but there are some mindblowing views at certain sections of the game. Randome encounters when travelling from one city to another can get annoying at times. The different in-game guilds do not really make you feel like you're a part of the guild (unlike the assassins brotherhood and the thieves guild in Skyrim which made you feel like a true member). While the dungeons are pretty varied and interesting, the main cities themselves are usually extremely small and not very interesting to explore. Combat can at times get overwhelming with the large number of skills and many of which are usually repetitive. The DLC is pretty decent and grants some useful skills and items to your party members. Overall, it is a pretty good game, definitely overrated but still worth playing.8/10			",134,12,1,20,8,0,6

												Mixed feelings on this game. I'll recommend it, sure, but know what you're getting into. This game will take time, annoyance and then some more time. It's an old school RPG, save constantly or die, and a lot of the finer points of the game, you'll have to figure out entirely on your own. Or google, which may hurt your immersion every so slightly.My first try to get started, I played less than an half an hour. Dwarf noble was just not a very exciting backstory, and trying to be an archer from level 1 did not quite work given the melee-arena grind that is the dwarf quest.Second time I figured I'd go in the opposite direction. Dalish TwoHand Warrior it was. The game felt sluggish as hell, and by the time I'd gotten to the point where the world opens up and you can go where you want, I didn't really want to go anywhere. I wanted my character to die.Third time though, as a dual wielding dwarf commoner rogue, my character felt right. The entire pacing of the fights was vastly improved, and I've been able to play since then.Good stuff:- A well fleshed out RPG universe- Hard is actually so hard, every save you forgot to do will haunt you- Fun playing around with different character from the party in combat to get some variety- Immersive soundtrack, and often quite beautiful enviroments.- A certain sequence in the mage tower was nothing short of epic.- Lots of content- Sten, Ohlgren, Leliana, Wynne, Shale and my dog were enjoyable companions.Bad:-  Loading screens. Ever more of them.-  You will probably need to pick certain party members every time due to their usefulness in combat, instead of taking party selection more In Character. *glares at mage characters in the party*-  Any KOTOR players will miss the option to queue actions so badly. You need to pause and jump through your party EXTREMELY vigilantly if you don't want the AI to waste spells for you etc.  For a game that is otherwise so similiar, its a shame they didn't include that as well.- Difficult fights are a bit random. Every now and then you'll cruise through enemies that storywise are ""tough"", then meet some random encounter that is death incarnate unless you've played the exact encounter before already. Meaning, you actually depend on having fought and lost to sort out a lot of the fights. This is ok, ofc, but with the many loading screens it gets annoying, and often makes me decide to quit the game and do something else instead.- Lots of content: There are a lot of good games out there, and limited amounts of time. This game takes a lot of time to get the most out of.- Allistair and Morrigan. Neither is particularly well written, and while both can be amusing, they're sub-par for Bioware. Sadly, they're pretty essential characters to bring if you're not a tank or a mage yourself. Additional comments:- Leliana's song DLC was pretty fun.- Darkspawn Chronicles seems to be really bugged.- By the time I'd finished the game, I hadn't talked to my companions for 13-20 hours. I'd used all their dialogue. That it's as limited as that sucks.			",39,21,0,12,5,0,3

												I haven't played this in a couple of weeks but if you combine my xbox versions total play time with this you would get close to 2000 hours played since the games release. And I genuinely never get bored. Such a great story and amazing characters. And personally I love the gameplay. This is genuinely one of my favourite games and I'm surprised at how few people have this game on my friends list, and of those who do, how little time has been played. So I urge you to give it another go or even pick it up.Also be sure to go to the nexus site for mods there are some pretty good mods there. And if  any of you don't know about the nexus check it out it's really helpful for finding and installing mods and you get an unlimited free trial.Seriously, if this is in the Christmas sales do yourself a favour and just buy this game.This, to me, was Bioware at the top of their game. Right before EA could get their money grubbing paws all over them.			",102,19,1,42,15,4,32

												Well Hello fellow Gamer's, Testers and Game designers.  Where to start On such a Magnitutde of a game.I'll start by saying I have played through most of this game, including most of the DLC as I own Ultimate edition for both Origin and Steam.  I think from memory I have beaten the game just the once near releae time.  That was Many years ago now however.  Ultimate edition comes with all the released DLC Made available for the game.  Grahpics 7/10 Could look a lot better but understandable as I imagine Bioware wanted the game to run on lower end PC's as well. Gameplay 8/10 Pretty good gameplay quests aquisition, dialogue, exploration, codex entries and loot are all their.  Story 9/10 As some would excepect from Bioware a top developer not the most Original but certanly keeps you interested.  Combat 8/10 Combat works well smooth responsive attacking varied abilities and talents.  Sound 9/10 Very good music throught fitting and eerie to suit the tone and theme of the game.  Overall 9/10 Stellar RPG Game Definatley one of the best in recent years.  Their you have it my first game reveiw hope you al enjoyed it and please feel free to comment on it with thumbs up or down.			",127,6,1,35,4,0,10

												I have been playing this game since 2009 on and off, I have like 3 copy of this game, one disk copy when it came out Awakening I bought digitally, Ultimate Edition on Steam and in Origins, My point is This game is good enough to buy it 3 times, Buy this game, Play this game. Fullfill your soul with some Bioware. A game that is truly a art with tremendous replayabilty with a very memorable cast. Dragon Age is in my top 5. It is sure to become yours too.

												Ahhhhhh...what a game, probably the last great Rpg that Bioware has put out, although i didn't play Inquisition yet.Play it if you like mature rpg's but make sure that you have time because this game will consume your time, your mind and eventually you will become a tranquil.It's like Lord of the Rings but without the ring and the Frodo's.A fantastic fantasy RPG.

												Better than DA2 and DAI. While less customizable, and with slower combat, and worse graphics, it remains the only truly enjoyable installment in the series of Dragon Age. The story is richer than Bill Gates, the characters are so memorable that it brings me to tears when some of them die or don't show up in the sequals. For any fantasy and RPG fan, I recommend the hell out of this game. If you haven't played it already, you are behind the times			",44,6,0,15,0,0,9

												Fantastic game, absolutely loving it at the moment.  Like a mashup of Skyrim, a Telltale Title and Pillars of eternity / Baldur's Gate 2.  Would definitely recommend, I'll be buying Dragon Age Inquistion once I'm done with this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
