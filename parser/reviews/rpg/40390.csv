												Risen2: Dark Waters is an open world RPG game based around the theme of pirates. Its the sequeal to the original Risen game developed by Piranha Bytes. Risen 2 was released in early 2012 on the PC and then later released on consoles. Even today, the game is still popular among PC gamers with at least one million people owning the game on Steam alone. This is an action RPG where you play in a third-person perspective to explore the world. You complete quests and customize your characters abilities and equipment through leveling up and assigning glory points. This takes RPG games back to their routes, allowing you to customize your character exactly how you want to play with the amount of abilities and talents on display. The combat much like Risen 1 is not exactly a strong point; it seems clunky at times, and you will often find your self dying through no fault of your own other than the strange combat system. You have two weapon slots, a melee weapon and a range weapon. You aren't able to use the range weapon unless you are within melee range of an enemy oddly yet your enemies have almost laser guided aim against you with their spears and guns. A nice little change I found was the infinite amount of inventory space you have, some will think this removes some of the challenge of the game, but for me I have always found a limited inventory space to be a chore which is not always needed. Obviously this means that currency is never a problem once you reach the latter stages of the game since you are able to just sell everything though. The graphics in Risen 2 are certainly an improvement on Risen 1, however there are a few glaring problems I found. The main one being the terrain pop-in throughout the open world. As you are roaming around the jungle, all of a sudden you will quite clearly notice trees and plants suddenly expanding before your very eyes. It's clear this is done to try and reduce the strain on systems for loading the world, but it is done in such an obvious way that sometimes it can ruin the immersion. I also found the game to be very very dark. The day/night circle while adds to the realism, the game is sometimes virtually unplayable in the night hours due to how dark it is. I found myself actually having to turn up the brightness settings at times to keep playing. While the game is completely voice acted, it does have some very bad acting in it; some of the lines which are said are very out of place and just don't fit right. That being said; there are some absolute classics such as ""...off, before I put a banana on your c*ck and call for the gorilla"" being easily the best line I have heard in a video game.Risen 2 is a hard game; as you begin your adventure you will die a lot of times due to being under geared and under trained and having no money. A lot of the early quests require you to have certain training in sneaking and lock picking, which all require gold to learn, so the game starts out very slowly. I would say the first three hours are the hardest part of the game due to the speed in which you are able to carry out even the smallest side quests. This is a well designed open world game. The world is full of life and plenty of items, weapons, buildings and much more to find. You are able to go mining, or skinning animals as well, which reminded me a lot of the MMO type games.Risen 2 has so much content to offer, so many side quests, worlds to explore, everything. I have put almost fifty five hours into this game, doing all of the side quests, a good amount of grinding and of course the main story. It's very rare these days to find a game this good that gives you that amount of gameplay. I had a few little technical issues which were random frame drops in certain areas, as well as long loading times but nothing that can't be overpowered by either using a SSD or a DIMM drive.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended 4) Highly recommended5) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												One of the worst RPGs I ever had the displeasure of playing. Let me break down my favourites just for the fun of it...- Clunky Controls : The guy moves like a friggin tank and everything feels so horribly sluggish, especially paired with those stiff as wood animations.- Terrible Combat : Click click click click click click click..Oh wait, there's actualy counter parries, dodge rolls and..nvm click click click click click click..Also, enemies can break your attack animation by simply hitting you with whatever they fancy. You, however, can not do the same to them, which is especially fun when you often have to fight 2 or 3 things at once.- Tedious Quests : This game even makes you pay your hard earned..and I mean HARD EARNED gold to move on in some quests. Nothing more RPG than having a silvertongue skill of 60 to make a ♥♥♥♥♥ drop her price from 1000 to 500 gold..well invested skills points, sir...Or you get the usual ""collect this and that through laborious and unfun work from all corners of the island"".- Level Up System : You do not level up, you just acquire fame which you then have to spend in 5 categories. Then you also get to pay gold to learn new ""abilites"" like thieving or lockpicking, for which you often require a certain level in the aforementioned categories. Lockpicking, for example, needs you to have spent around 20000 fame to even be able to learn it on a very basic level. Doing a quest usually gives you 50-100 fame as does killing an enemy..you do the maths. This ties into..- Exploration Denied : Imagine beating some tough monsters, by letting your comrade do all the work just to reach a chest. Oh no, it requires a xx in lockpicking skill. Access denied, unless you already assembled 20000 fame somehow and the gold to upgrade your skill and the clothing to add some bonus to your skills. In the end you won't even bother to explore anymore, because you will usually lack the skills to reap the rewards. But if you do not lack them, then this ties into..- Worst Loot EVER : Fancy finding new weapons ? New armor ? A cool hat ? Magic Boots ? Haha, no...All the good items you will get (all those..less than 15 pieces of clothing available in the whole game), will require you to buy them from merchants.. There is absolutely nothing to find equipment-wise, except for a few broken sword pieces which you can smith together (requires you to have spent fame and gold and what not again though to learn smithing in the first place, so..basically not for free either). You won't find any clothes ever, in fact most chest rewards will be absolutely laughable like..I don't know...finding 10 gold in a chest or maybe..MAYBE 50..Usually it's just a major waste of time and effort.-  Fighting the Kraken and the final boss : Ok, mostly the Kraken..who designed that and why ? Seriously..All in all this game is a major step down from Risen 1, which already wasn't the best game in the world, but still better than this..product.			",377,186,6,94,37,5,61

												A great but flawed game. The game starts very slow and combat feels a bit underwhelming, but if you stick out the first few hours, the game just climbs in fun factor and epicness. By the time you get a musket, you are in heaven, blasting monsters in a hail of black gunpowder smoke.Overall, I liked this game, and half way through, loved it. It is one of those games that grows on you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let's see... Risen 2 is a classic Piranha Bytes game. So what's a Piranha Bytes game like? Well, it is an open world rpg which presents a fabulous world to explore and has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fighting mechanics. I am a fan of Gothic series, especially Gothic 1 & 2. So I liked Risen 2 very much. Tough beware if you are not familiar with Gothic. This game may not be the game you want or think. Or it may be.Risen 2 presents very very very beautiful lands to explore. Besides the models, the graphics are very good and the only thing that prevents you to feel you are actually in that tropical island is the lack of wind on your face. The short but adequate soundtrack also plays it's part well. So if you like open-world RPGs I definetely recommend the Risen 2. Just keep in mind that Risen 2 is a little ""different"" game.   Overall game mechanics may be and will be awkward sometimes. The fighting mechanics are broken as in every Piranha Bytes game, especially for the first 10 hours in the game (But don't give up, it gets easier and enjoyable after you get some skills and stuff). The progress is slow and painful. The story is not strong but the cheesy characters are somehow enjoyable. So it's like a negative review. Actually it is not. The point is, Piranha Bytes never learn from their mistakes. Yet their all games has a kind of strange charm in them. They make you angry, but they make you happy more. Those bad gameplay mechanics that you will complain, you will get to enjoy them after a point. At least, you will ignore them. The ""charm"" that the game possesses makes you enjoy the game. Besides, Risen 2 really puts you in the world, as Gothic 1 did back in the time. Maps are so lively. You can play and enjoy the game even just for that. 8/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I loved this game, and I kind of feel bad that the first 3 top reviews for this game are negative. It is not an amazing game, and to begin with the Gothic games were never regarded as really good games anyway, but it is surely a game worth checking out. I have great memories with Gothic 1 and 2, and while i did not enjoy Gothic 3, Arcania (even though someone else developed it) or the first Risen, Risen 2 is in my opinion a game worth playing and finishing and the best Piranha Bytes made so far. So starting with the good bits, the story is quite good. It is memorable and so is the world and the quests. There are some exceptional characters with an amazing personality (Jaffar, Bones). It's supposed to be the kind of game where you want to explore every corner of the map, open every chest, kill every mob and do every quest to get the highest amount of exp and gold to become overpowered. And this is why it is the best 'Gothic' game, because it does a very good job at that. And the bad bit: the combat is simplistic, and the boss fights not that epic. The factions are not as good as the first games. The talent tree is not perfectly optimised but there are unique 'piratey' items in the game that sort of help that later in the game. Some abilities are pointless and require a lot investment to get them and muskets are just too strong. And while you are a pirate captain and hunt down other pirates and have your own crew, plus the drinking and shooting mini-games and treasure to find, it just doesn't feel like you are a pirate. Oh yeah and main flaw, achievements stop counting if you exit the game.So if you want a relaxing 'piratey' game, with lots of conversations, zones to explore and loot to find I think it does a pretty good job at that.

												For anyone who has ever wondered what the Gothic series would be like if it went 'mainstream,' here's your answer.  Risen 2 wastes its interesting setting and solid content by wrapping it around horribly flawed mechanics and watered down design.  Melee combat is bad, ranged/firearms are absurdly overpowered, voodoo is a shallow replacement for the magic of the past few games, the 'boss' fights are laughable, there are no factions....  There. Are. No. Factions.  Rather than improve on their past mistakes, Piranha Bytes is content to just give up and phone it in so long as a publisher is willing to fund the project.  Risen 3 should be a trip.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A game that really is a rough diamond. Those first three hours are the trial by fire. Your skills in combat are limited and you spend most of your time running around a jungle getting your♥♥♥♥♥♥kicked.Shortly after that it all seems to come together, you realise the combat is all about timing, you get training to develop your skills and you fall in love with the charm that the game oozes. Its not the most polished game out there but some of the dialogue is fantastic and depending on your build you can have 3 or more alternative options in every conversation. For example investing in Toughness makes you more intimidating to Npcs. Cunning on the other hand improves your thievery ie. pickpocking and Silver tongue skill (persuasion).One of the biggest choices in the game is the Musket/Voodoo decision. The guns make you more powerful in combat but believe me you are missing out on some rping goodness by not choosing Voodoo. Entire quest lines are altered just because of that choice and the conclusion of said quests is hilarious. So if you see this game go on sale, you love classic Rpgs, ignore the metacritic and give it a shot.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Bottoms up, Captain!Oh lads, how I enjoyed this game. Robbing graves, fighting monsters and drinking rum is what you would expect from this game and it's what you get and I can't miss to mention digging treasures! The world is divided into Lost realm and New World. Lost realm is where Titans fight each other in order to rule the world as the strongest power in the universe. You are starting the game in Caldera , mankind's last bastion on the Lost realm, and you arre given the most important quest - to save the world by killing one of the Titans, a sea monster known as Mara. It's not an easy task and you will have to do everything you can imagine for that, even be publicly expelled from the Inquision an organization protecting the manking. Your first step is to get an anciant artefact, a magical Spear, it's told to be the only weapon able to kill Mara. Rumor says pirate Captain Steelbeard has found it and you have to become a pirate to find him!Gameplay and story are really exciting, but fight system is not so good and better to not mension boss fight which are more boring than interesting. Still game offers almost 30 hours of amazing gameplay.6.5 /10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The first Risen game was very rough around the edges, but great.I got barely five minutes into Risen 2 and it's jaw dropping.some minor things:The pirate theme isn't bad, pirates were a notable part of the first game directly and indirectly.The animations are generally realistic, but during dialogue they become exaggerated like you would see in a highly stylised game. very odd.Lip syncing for the dialogue is far worse somehow, the first game had basically bare-bones mouth movement, simple and effective. This one, however, is strange, the mouths don't move half the time and the movement is completely out of time with how fast people are talking.Combat is much more clunky. Perhaps this changes as the game goes on?There are 3 unforgivable problemsI'm not even sure how to properly describe this one, I'm sure there must a term for it out there somewhere because you can see it in other types of media. It's 'rushed,' dialogue is rushed past so fast it's mind numbing. Just ""this is the problem this is the plan,"" a conversation about important issues that would require more detail and background information is blasted through in 2 to 3 sentences. I know not everyone likes lots of dialogue, but this is so stripped back it feels completely unrealistic. To go along with that you are also moved around in the same way, instead of talking to a person then moving to the next location or person you are just put there instantly to continue the scene. Again it's something I'm sure some people welcome, but it's just so jarring, like they don't want you to experience the world they crafted, they just want to push you through it as fast as possible.It's obvious they should have just made an entirely new universe for this game. Though they've kept the skeleton of the story from the first game they haven't continued it. Instead they introduce completely new obstacles in the plot that seem completely out of place. perhaps it could all work with some proper backstory and explanation, but because of 'rushed' effect explained before it's just TONS of stuff out of nowhere that just doesn't work.short list of things that came out of nowhere without proper explanation:Why are you now a full fledged member of the inquisition; you could be a member in the first game, but due to the ending and the fact that you could follow other paths, an explanation is needed.Why do you start the game in this city; why did you leave the island; how did you get across the sea again when the first game makes it clear the magical storms are making sailing almost impossible.Mara is introduced like you should know who she is, this is a situation where the player knows nothing about a topic and even though player's character might know things you need to present the player with the information in a natural way.In the opening cinematic and the information you gain over the course of the first game you learn that water titans (or at least titans that can travel on the ocean) are destroying ships and causing the storms; now the threat is Mara and Kraken with no mention of the titans.Character personalities. In the few minutes I devoted to this game I met 4 characters from the first game; the main character, Patty, Severin, and Commandant Carlos. All of them act significantly differently than they did in the first game. (and the last two look completely different as well, changing in age and physique)HOWEVER some of these problems are, in fact, explained. They are explained away in a single small paragraph, presumably from the devs, I found on the wiki (very minor spoilers for the first game, spoiler tag probably isn't needed tbh), but it's not mentioned in game at all.While in the Inquisition, the Nameless Hero tried to fight the Titans, but soon magic is banned as too dangerous, the Titan Lord armor and weapon are left to sink in the sea. The monocle turned out to be cursed, so once removed, the Nameless Hero lost his eye. Besides, having used magical items, he was regarded with suspicion by people around him. Abandoned and disappointed, the Nameless Hero could not do anything but drown his sorrow in rum for years.None of this is presented in game and it has some serious issues.Magic is banned? this is nonsense, humanity is on the brink of defeat, and so far magic has proven to be the only effective way to succeed.No one would throw away a set of armor that made you nearly immune to the titans’ power, again, humanity is dying, losing against the titans on all fronts.No one would throw away the monocle, even with this (very minor) curse. It is the only known way to see titans, which are otherwise INVISIBLE.I can’t imagine anyone on the island of the first game would treat him with suspicion. Maybe it’s just other people since he has now left the island? Really needs some clarification. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Its fun, whoever liked the first part or the Gothic series will enjoy this game. Undeniable it has some edges, e.g parts of the combat system or the overall character animations but thats probably because of a low budget, but beneath that lies a really good RPG with nice graphics and a nice realization of the pirate scenario. Whereas the mainstory is kinda boring, there is like a bad god and you spend the game preparing to kill that god. I don't want to spoil too much but the ending is pretty obvious after a while, so not really interesting.Same goes for most characters, while some of them are at least good written, they are boring as hell and simple chliches, so everyone who is in search for a game with deep lore and interesting characters won't be satisfied with this game. The fighting system is kind of fun, at least against humanoid enemies, against animals its much more simple but less fair. While you can counterattack humans there is no possibillity to do so against animals, you can not even block incoming attacks of some animals. One tip: don't use the musket that much, that makes the game even easier than it already is, at least in the latter parts. Either way, after about 20 hours you should play the game on hard,  many enemies stay the same while you become undoubtedly better.The skill system is a fairly simple one, you get XP for every kill/quest you do, which you can then spend on one of 5 traits which are: Blades, toughness, firearms, cunning and voodoo.The money you gain you either spend on improving your skills at special trainers or in gear like clothes, swords or pistols.The graphics are sometimes really gorgeous, the design also. Even after 30 hours of gameplay the jungles or beaches you visit won't be boring at all. But still, the worst part of the game is part of the graphics though: the character animations, those are so unbelievable bad you should probably laugh at them rather then criticizing them.And for everyone with a fairly good computer, you should check out the mod ""AntiWarp"", it removes that weird warping of the plants, it's really easy to install as well.

												I have been a fan of Piranha Bytes since Gothic 2, and have played and beaten all their games. For some reason the Pirate theme and look of this game put me off; it seemed different, and worse than previous titles. After picking it up for just a buck during the Humble ReBundle, it pleasantly surprised me. I'd rank this right up there with the rest of their games. Adventuring in their open world maps, stealing and beating up NPCs is great fun. The game is also VERY pretty on max settings. I actually thought the combat was an improvement over previous titles; it was still difficult, but learning an enemy's patterns and fully utilizing your abilties (leveling up your 'player skill') proved fruitful, and that's satisfying. The voice acting was decent - nothing incredible, mind you, but I tend to be picky and felt the actors were pretty good; their manner of speaking reminded me of Game of Thrones a couple times.If you take your time with each island, exploring it throroughly and completeing all the quests, this is actually a reasonably long game. My first (very thorough) playthrough was over 50 hours, and the game is constructed so that you cannot get all the skills or experience all the content in a single playthrough. I don't know if it will hold my attention for a second go-around, but I could see my clock hitting nearly 100 hours if I do, and that's great bang for your buck.Another reviewer complained that training and items were ""too expensive"" and the game was ""too difficult"". I couldn't disagree more. Too often, loot and gold are meaningless in games. You hoard hundreds of thousands of gold and have nothing to spend it on! In this game, you need to choose what gear and training you get with care, and that gives a real sense of value to loot when you get it. As for ""too difficult""? Maybe my opinion is different as a fan since Gothic 1, but the challenge in these games are part of the experience. Why should you be able to go anywhere and beat anyone willy-nilly? One of the most memorable experiences of Gothic 2 was when I faced a situation in which I found myself unable beat a crowd of Orcs guarding the enterance to a city, and was forced to make a break from my ""kill everything"" mentality, and instead find a way to sneak past them and then proceed to RUN FOR MY LIFE! This was such a breath of fresh air! Furthermore, if you use all your resources in this game (proper gear, potion use... strategy) you can prevail in any fight, and overcoming the challenge makes it all the more satisfying when you do.This game might not be for everyone. There are bugs, and quirks, but looking past those you have a very thoughtfully and lovingly made game here. I definitely recommend it. If you like Risen, or Gothic, this should be a safe buy, but you may want to wait for a sale.All said and done, I really enjoyed this game, would have paid more for it, and would like to pick up the DLC when it goes on sale. Looking forward to Risen 3: Titan Lords, for sure!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A Game that has alot of Potential and Interesting Mechanics but very poor executionLet Me Give You ExamplesI can learn Voodoo as a skill, But It only unlocks late game where it would take too long to effectively developI can train a Monkey, which will steal and distract others, but It dies in one shot I can have a parrot, which distracts enemies, But seems to fly away after one use and is pretty much worthlessI get a ship, But its a damn loading screen with no effect on gameplay (IN A PIRATE RPG)I get a crew, but only maybe two of the Crew are interesting and don't end up twiddling their thumbs back at baseAnd so on.(Also I have to learn how to kick via a trainer whom I pay, despite being an Elite Government Agency Soldier, who must recruit troops from daycare if I am the best Trooper on hand)The game defintely has a few things going for it that you can see, but unfortunately the developer doesn't seem to know what to do with it, which issue is only compounded by the ridiculous level of Bugs and poor feel of quality this game has.4/10, Would only reccomend if on sale for a price in the single digits			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had a great time playing this game. Is it glitchy? Yes. Embarrassingly so. Is it cheesy? Arrr. It be cheesy matey.Nonetheless, it is also somewhat epic as an RPG and as a pirate game. It can be unforgiving at first, but once you get over the hump and start being able to afford upper tier training, things start moving really quickly.The game itself is unabashedly silly as far as the dialogue goes, the graphics aren't great by today's standards, but the gameplay is nonetheless quite solid, the cutscenes are pretty well done, etc....This is a game you will love if you give it a fair chance, love RPG's, love pirates, and aren't afraid of rough edges.By the way, what be a pirates favorite letter? ""R"" you say. Nay, it be the C. *rimshot*Anyway, I give this 7 Arrs out of 10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Basic InformationTitle:  Risen 2 - Dark WatersDeveloper:  Piranha BytesPublisher:  Deep SilverGenre:  3rd Person ActionGeneral ImpressionRisen 2 is a worthy sequel and the second best pirate-themed game to date, after Assassin's Creed IV. It features an open world that is filled with detail and fun areas to explore. One of the game's few cons is the combat system which can take some time, getting used to. Another might be the voice acting but considering the subtitles included, it is also only a minor nuisance. All in all, the game is not as good as the first Risen but it is most certainly better than Risen 3.Strong Points+ Beautiful graphics.+ Intersting story and scenery.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points- Quite a few bugs and glitches.- Finicky control scheme.Rating 7/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews and Cubbes.

												Very fun involved game. The combat is tedious but realistic. Each monster has a different way of defeating him other than just mashing the attack button but until you unlock more abilities, they are very hard, almost too hard. Lots of interesting things to do but they don't hold you hand in figuring it out, most of the time you are on your own.			",896,291,34,99,89,8,128

												I was laughing for the last hour, reading negative reviews for Risen 2. Well, what can I say?There will always be some problems with Piranha Bytes games, mostly of the technical origin. I can foretell you that, being a fan of them from the year 2002, when I climbed on the highest and almost inaccessible tower in the first Gothic game... and on the top of it a chest which contained a mysterious item with description in German, the only use of that was breaking my save file... So what?Piranha Bytes may not be code wizards, but they do an impressive work over the years. They bring passion, dedication, soul in the every game they making. For that I'm grateful.Down to the Risen 2. The most user-friendly, most casual in the progress compared with the previous games... And with embellished and fancy pirate theme. Surely it attracted some new players to the franchise. Aaaand... some of them were distracted! That's that I felt, while was reading all those complaints about awkward controls, unbearable skills elaboration system etc.For my part, I got that for what has come into the game: an interesting adventure. You know the kind where you explore new lands, meet new people, kill some of them, getting better in the process...I had some downsides, too. For first, game was far more narrative than before, and exploring part was less than usual in favor of major quest line by saving the world. Second, famous tech issues of the developer made a process of gaining achievements far more complicated. And for third, my pride suffered a bit from the shooting mini-game, where I cannot hit any bottle!All of those minuses are tolerable, of course. For the luxury of being a pirate captain with your own ship and crew... Risen 2 is surely deserved its cost.8/10 killed pirates			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Some of my friends call me silly because of this, but ever since I played Gothic, the first Piranha Bytes game I've ever played, I've been following the games the company has released and to this day, I have yet to find one that I don't like. Most of my friends tend to curse at the ""difficult"" gameplay and levelling up, but I say to them - ""That's old-school for you."" And I like it. Nowadays, I find some of the games a bit too easy to play, but the old-school ones make me think before I start slashing and hacking at enemies, because it can happen that a boar gets me from the back and I'm done.Risen 2 reminds me of the Gothic series quite a but, but it shouldn't surprise me since it's made by the same company. I am in love with its graphics and the storyline is very interesting. I also quite like the character redesigns from the first Risen game and their development throughout the game. Take the main protagonist for example - at the beginning of the game he's a drunkard, right? And at the end of the game, he rises as a hero again.The new enemies are quite interesting too - I've always wanted to play more pirate games, but I haven't found an interesting one as of yet, excluding Gothic II's Addon and Risen 2 - did you notice that both of the games that made pirates interesting are made by PB? :) Anyway, I warmly recommend this game to everyone that doesn't get too frustrated with the ""difficult"" gameplay. As I said, that's old-school for ya.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Risen 2: Dark Waters is a pirate themed RPG, which takes place after the events of the first Risen. It is a seriously underestimated game. I personally enjoyed playing it. It's a great game worth playing which has a good story, great well-made pirate atmosphere and world with many islands and places to explore. The only kinda negative things that i found in the game are some technical problems that may be found while playing (mainly fps drops, but they can easily get fixed), and the combat for some people seems to be bad and hard to manage.I personally, enjoyed playing Risen 2 and I would gladly play it again for sure. I recommend it to any fan of pirates and RPG player out there. It's a quite good game and worth trying!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Risen 2: Dark Waters is a direct continuation to Risen, featuring the same nameless hero and some of his old companions, Patty and Steelbeard, but set in an entirely new ambientation. Risen 2 parts from the sword and shield medieval fighting world of Faranga to a musket, pistol, cannon and sabers fighting modern age. Risen 2 is set in the age of the conquistadors, where a kind of sabre-fighting and musket-shooting Spanish fleet is invading new lands inhabited by spear-throwing and voodoo-casters natives. You, a ""good pirate"", must fight the ""bad pirates"" for relics to fight the water titan lord, Mara, and for that, you need to choose to side with the inquisition, which will give you muskets, or the Natives, which will give you voodoo spells.It is a story about the romantic and cliche view of pirates, With a lot of rum, eye patches, parrots, typical clothing and speaking, etc. Despite being a mediocre RPG, the story is captivating. If you see it on a sale, it is worth buying and giving a chance.If you have played Risen before, you'll find better and worse aspects in comparison:First, the battle system was crippled. It's a shame, since Risen battle system was very good. Even without training, one could battle stronger enemies given enough skill. Now, without training, you can't do anything but swing your sword around. You can't dodge anymore, the dodge was changed to a kind of roll, which is not only unrealistic (because you roll too far away) but serves only to flee, since you don't end up in a good position to counter attack.Second, magic was removed from the game. It just didn't fit in the modern feel the developers wanted for the game. Instead, it was changed for voodoo, a kind of cursing spells used by the natives, that is almost useless for combat but adds interesting events in the game.And third, for the good news, quests are less linear and more interesting.

												Risen 2 is a third person open world action roleplaying game made by Piranha Bytes, the team that gave us the Gothic games and of course the first Risen game. It's hard to talk about Risen 2 without referring to their previous games, which I'll call 'PB games' for short.To summarize: Risen 2 sometimes feels like a 'PB game lite' but it's certainly not completely dumbed down from previous PB games. The atmosphere and the 'feel' of the PB games is there, so I'll enjoy playing this game more than I would 9 out of 10 similar games. The fact that melee combat is almost as bad as it was in Gothic 3 and the absence of 'real' magic are the only two problems that certainly knock off some points in the final score for Risen 2.To talk about this game more in-depth, I'll take the list I used for my 'Risen' review to elaborate about the aspects that make PB games enjoyable experiences in a  way that only PB can create them. Now, as I will be focusing on the differences in Risen 2 compared to earlier PB games, this may come across as a pretty negative review. This is not my intention though. I like this game and recommend it to everyone who is looking for a decent but challenging roleplaying game. But I think people who are familiar with previous PB games will benefit from reading about the differences between previous PB games and Risen 2 to help them decide whether to buy this game or not, more than they would from reading yet again that Risen 2 is a nice but not a flawless pirate-themed RPG. So let's... - Exciting melee combat... well, NOT. Not this time. You'll soon discover that the melee combat is just as clunky and worthless as it was in Gothic 3. Against beasts it's a clickfest, so you won't experience some form of tactical melee combat like in Gothic, Gothic 2 and Risen here. Against human(oid) opponents, the melee combat becomes more tactical but somewhat boring because opponents can block forever unless you counter their endless block with a specific move... which leaves you open for attacks and after which both parties will get back to blocking. This makes fighting humanoid opponents a slow experience. Only when your level in swordfighting is very high, so in the second half of the game at the earliest, will you be able to learn 'Powerful Riposte' which makes melee combat actually fun. But by then, you'll most likely have adopted a whole different style of fighting, most probably ranged combat (style 'hit-and-run' or 'kite'). This is really Gothic 3 all over.About the ranged combat. At first, I couldn't get over the fact that Risen 2 has no bows or crossbows at all, unlike all previous PB games. Risen 2 starts a short time after where Risen 1 ended, but all of a sudden nobody uses bows anymore and everyone uses guns instead. But once you get over that, you find that the ranged combat in this game is actually quite effective and fun. Yup, just like in Gothic 3. In Risen 2, you can wield a sword in one hand and a pistol in the other, if you want to stick with blades as your main weapon. But pistols only become decent weapons when you learn a skill to reload them a lot faster. The alternative is fully choosing guns and wielding two-handed guns like the musket or the shotgun.Usually, 'magic' is another alternative to melee combat in PB games, but not this time around. Don't get me wrong, you can join a faction that allows you to learn some sort of magic (Voodoo) but it is limited to curses and debuffs. So there are no magic attack spells whatsoever in Risen 2. It's too bad there's only one decent option, really, but let's focus on the good news here: going with guns (or blade + pistol) is a good and fun build in this game. Or maybe you will like the challenge of going with swords and/or Voodoo anyway. You can always change the difficulty of the game in the options menu if you want to play a certain way but find it too difficult (for the first part of the game).- Learning curve for your character: like in all PB games there isn't just a learning curve for the player but for the character, too. He needs to learn to fight better. As the game progresses and you improve your character's skills, you actually feel your character getting better. This curve is pretty steep in Risen 2. The reason why they had to do this is because for about 90% of the game, you will have an NPC fighting alongside you. So you can't become a godlike solo fighting machine (too soon) or the game would be too easy for people who choose to take a follower NPC with them, as is the case in Risen 3. Now, we had follower NPCs in all the previous PB games but they where very temporary, more like for 10% of the game so the opposite of Risen 2. - Factions: this time, there are only two factions to choose from. You will join other 'factions' through the main storyline, but the only real choice you have to make, will be between the Inquisition and the Natives. As usual, each faction has their own set of preferred skills and weapons. The Inquisition = guns, the natives = Voodoo and throwing weapons (which are very weak but hey, it's an option). Another difference with earlier PB games is that there is no real 'faction armor'. You will wear the clothes that offer the best defense, whether you side with the natives or with the inquisition. Also, of all the PB games, the faction choice in Risen 2 has the least impact on the game as a whole. Right after making your choice, a few quests are different for each of the factions, but after that the game has 97% the same quests and storyline for all players.- Trainers: to learn new skills, you will still need to visit a trainer who can teach you. But not so for your stats anymore. 'Strength' and 'dexterity' have been replaced with more interesting stats (blades, guns, defense, thieving and voodoo). You increase these by spending XP (called 'glory' as of Risen 2) directly in the character screen. Each of the 5 stats has an impact on 3 talents (e.g. for gunfighting you have muskets, shotguns and pistols) and each of the 5 stats determines which skills you can learn providing you can afford the price in gold and find an appropriate teacher. At first, it seems like a bummer they removed the old and well-loved strength and dexterity system, but the new system is actually a lot more elaborate and interesting, and makes for more varied character development options.- Great atmosphere: the settings, the NPCs, the towns, the music, the humour, ... everything adds to a distinct atmosphere that only PB can create. Although, I must admit in this aspect the 'slightly dumbing down' of the game is most noticeable. Nothing huge, little things really. But it's the little things... Example: there is only one type of food in your inventory, called 'provisions'. So you'll pick up apples and cheese like in previous PB games, but in your inventory they are immediately converted into 'provisions'. You'll still loot raw meat from animals you killed and you can fry this meat at a fire, but once the meat is fried, it's converted into 'provisions' as well. Another example: after beating an NPC in a duel, you can no longer loot them or even pick up their weapon. One last example: in most cases you can steal items in NPC's houses without any real repercussions. They will moan something to let you know they saw you steal but that's it.Like I said earlier, things like that often made me feel like I was playing a 'PB game lite'. Simplifying things is not necessarily a bad thing, and people who never played another PB game wouldn't even think twice about things like that. But all in all, I'll take a 'PB lite' game over 9 out of 10 similar games any time!Note about achievements: some achievements are bugged but completionists can unlock them, mostly by using console commands. There is a nice guide here on Steam (scroll down or use the index to jump to the english translation):

												This game pulled me right in and I couldn't stop playing it. Very few games have done this to the degree that this one did. I found it intense, a blast to play, and so much atmosphere. I give this game a 10 our of 10, and I am getting ready to play it again before I play Risen 3. I totally recommend this game.

												This game was a real disappointment to me. I've really liked the first Risen, but Risen 2 is nothing what the first game made me expect from it. Developers have completly broken the combat. It was challenging and enjoyable in Risen 1... Here it's almost like combat from some MMORPG where you keep clicking and use special attacks. Changing the whole theme to pirates just doesn't seem fitting because the first game was nothing like this. The story seems generic and not really immersive... I've bought this game back when it was out, at a full price, and really tried to enjoy it, but I just couldn't. While Risen 2 is not THAT terrible, it just didn't meet my expectations. It has little to do with Risen 1, and I can't say I'd recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got a bad first impression as there are many regressions compared to previous Piranha Bytes games (Risen and the first three Gothic). Graphics glitches, a poorer NPCs behaviour (more static, more repetitive movements, more exploitable....), a few of important changes in the gameplay such as the missing animation while you use a potion or food to heal yourself that makes the fights much easier as the healing effect is immediate or almost so... Despite that, it is still clearly a Piranha Bytes RPG game and I very enjoyed it. It seems what it is really improved compared to the first Risen are - at least  - some aspects of the story: narration, dialogues (not always good though), two-three well done characters (especially Jaffar, ""♥♥♥♥ yes"", he is a fun travelling companion). I'm not a fan of the Pirates, but looks as it may be a good game for people who is looking for this, due to the gameplay and even the story.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The pirate themed setting is great and yet it feels like old Gothic/Piranha Byte game all the way. Give a shot, you landlubber! Arrr!PS.

												The controls can get frustrating at times but more often then not you don't even notice. Not for casuals who want everything handed to them; you actually have to manage your gold instead of being able to buy out every store you come across and when you get new equipment it actually means something instead of a constant stream of over powered disposable weapons. It is a good old school game with a great story and a decent sense of humor  The gnome you can get on your crew is hilarious . The combat system was dumbed down from the original but what do you expect when they make a game with consoles in mind. Over all give this game a chance and you wont regret it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Risen 2 is a difficult game to review since it does so many things well, but also fails in so many areas. However if you grit your teeth and get through the tedious first couple of hours there is an unpolished gem of a game with numerous islands and coastal areas to sail to and explore at your whim.The locations look amazing but the lighting flickers, there are plenty of chests to loot yet you'll never get any good weaponry or armor in said chests, combat is kinda crap but you can just use your never-say-die party member to take on all the baddies for you anyway, there is stacks of npc interaction but the tasks they get you to do are mostly similar.I could go on forever about how this game takes virtually every aspect and does it right, BUT also somehow kinda does it wrong, or vice-versa...I'd give it a 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let's not sugarcoat it: technical level of this game is extremely poor. Low res textures, rigid and simple character animations and ""simple"" combat rules, random frame drops and rarely even drastic ones, up to 1-2 fps for no reason, sporadic bugs and so on, even plot it's not the most awesome thing you'll ever see.So why do I recommend this game? First of all, the storytelling is pretty awesome, dialogues are catchy and fun and you'll end up really wanting to see what happens next. It also features a rather unique level up system where you upgrade attributes (Blades, Firearms, Cunning and Voodoo) that  unlocks abilities that you'll have to learn from someone who'll teach you in exange of gold, a nice variation to the ""character that figures stuff out of thin air"" as you level up.The rules of combat are simple, but the fighting itself must be reasoned, since the game penalizes button mashing quite harshly.That being said, it's a game that focuses of exploration and quests, as there will be a lot of those.Quests speaking, i've never encontered a bug quest-wise, so none are broken and/or uncompletable, which is important in a game like this.Afterall, despite serious technical problems, Risen 2 it's a gem of itself that deserves to be played by any fan of Adventure/RGP, just buy it on discount			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""F*CK YES!!""Gothic 1, Gothic 2 and Gothic 3. Risen 1, Risen 2 and Risen 3. What does Gothic series have in common with Risen series? Yes, you figured the question out - Piranha Bytes. Back in the days, everybody was looking forward Gothic 4, yes from Piranha, but instead we got Gothic 4 alias ArcaniA from Spellbound. But what Piranha did? They didn't fall asleep, they get back to work and came out with awesome Risen series. So basically we can say that thanks to no Gothic 4 we got Risen. Anyway, there is not so much games about Pirates, and most of those are either old, animated, 2d and/or strategy games like Port Royale or Tropico 2. Except Risen 2, the big open-world game about Pirates I know and I have enjoyed that much as I have enjoyed Risen 2 is most definitely AC4: Black Flag. But without mentioning these two, there's nothing else for me, if so, let me know.The actual topic about the Pirates, the story and point the game is all about, the place the game is set, dialogues, characters, Inquisition vs. Pirates, Kraken, Mara and of course Patty mixed all together makes this game absolutely awesome. I don't really want to get too much into the story as I never want to, but you as the let's say ex-member of Inquisition you are determinted to eliminate Mara - Titan Lord of Water to ensure peace in the Southern Seas. Story is pretty gripping and will last you around 20-30 hours depends on how you play it. 2 additional hours with DLC.Southern Seas - vast expance of water - that is just place to be. Islands, grog, Pirates, ladies, palms, sun, coconuts, beaches, big boats, warm weather and OF COURSE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING EVER - RUM! What a time to be alive!I still can't get over it, how awesome places this game actually have. From Inquisition Forts to so beautiful beaches you can imagine. Sometimes you even feel the sun on your face.There is a lot of items you can use, but I believe almost everybody will stick to the combination of sword and pistol. I just wish there would be even more items you can use, like the bigger hunt for better clothing and weapons. Also if there would be more clothing, that would be absolutely brilliant. I like the selection of provisions and drinks, and even the options to do dirty tricks.The way you progress and evolve is not pretty well choosen I would say and it is because you basically do not evolve with the experience, but by gold. Well, it is combined with experience earned + gold, but if it was two independed elements, that would be even better. The game does not have problems with quest bugs, or some major bugs and if it had in 2012, I am sure it is fixed now. Lot of people said that AI is pretty low and most of the times it gets stucked somewhere, but it did not happened to me a lot, I would say twice or something like that. Even when I have abandoned them, it was all calm. The fact that Piranha Bytes did not fixed bugged achievements, even after forum rants and petitions, is really sad. Yes, they completely removed 7 achievements that was unobtainable, but there is still over 10+ that is bugged because in game counter always reset to zero, when the game is closed. So either you play and let the game on and grind, or you will use command console. I do not even consider some of the achievements as grinding. Let me put it this way - If you kill around 400-500 monsters in one walkthrough, and you can do 2000 for an achievement, I would grind it, as I grinded few achievements like that. But when you cannot even leave the game to counter not reset AND EVEN IF YOU GRIND IT, AND GAME CRASHED FOR EVERYBODY AT 1500, then sorry, I am going to spam the sh*t out of command console, because it is not like I do not want to grind. Now Piranha is making ELEX debuting 2017, and I'm really looking forward to it and I hope they do above average job with it. Most of the bugs and mistakes they did over Risen 2, they did not in Risen 3, so I really think that ELEX will be clean and I wish them the best with it. You can count on me, I am definitely getting it.Before we get to the end of this review and the final rating, I would like to say, that not like the other reviews I wrote, this one will have one more rating. I hope you understand what I mean by the non-objective one.DLC will be rated next time.Bonus Point: Fact that it is about PiratesPersonal Non-Objective Rating: 9.5/10Objective Rating: 7/10 ",94,13,6,7,12,1,6

												4 years has passed and still enjoyable and fun to playeverything you like in an rpg game is here , open world ,exploration ,freedom , a lot of quest , choices that change the main plot , skills ...etcthe same thing that maid me love the first game is present here in this game and that is your choices and the side quest really do matters, in fact the whole plot of this second game was in the beginning a side quest that you can find in the first risen game ( so i suggest you to play the first game to really understand this one )-beautiful and dynamic open world with amazing graphics to explore-a lot of main and side quests that you can complete with different strategy ( sometimes you fight and sometime you think)-smooth gameplay, easy to understand how the game works , skills are easy to use but a bit chaotic at the beginning and takes time to unlock them , in fact i had to use a cheat code to complete a side quest (require a high skill at the very beginning of the game with a find annoying ) + fast travel between location ( save a lot of time)-no bugs or glitches except one time in a side quest, my partner was stuck and didn't want to move so i had to reload a save game ( you can save anytime you want and thats great)-most of the achievements are easy to unlock ( just by playing) but the others needs the DLCs ( i hate that in a game)finally i highly recommend this game to fan of the first risen game and also gamers that love a good RPG game , worth the money but you can always get in on sales 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This was an amazing game! As a huge fan of fantasy rpgs, this game had everything I could want and more. Risen 1 was a cool but hard game. This one was so much more smooth and very enjoyable. A tad on the simple side maybe, but oh my it was so much fun. I loved the drawback of pirates, natives, and conquistadors that gave the game such an exotic feel. The story is really good and the companions are very helpful and fun. This was a fantastic game that I highly reccomend. The dlcs aren't really worth it but they do add money and experience. If you love rpgs, pirates, or the amazing games of deep silver then I know you'll just love this booty of awesomeness!			",261,45,1,24,6,0,7

												+ Better graphics+ Companions+ The storyline it's more interesting but less immersive+ Treasures and items that gives permanent bonus+ The skill system was remade+ Leveling it's a bit easier because you spend your experience (Glory) directly to your main attributes, you still need to spend gold to train different skills+ Pirates- Graphic bugs, don't forget to change your refresh rate, you will experience some serious problems- Somehow the story it's more linear and shorter then in the first game- Sometimes the game is unresponsive, need to click multiple times and stuff like that.- Companions can get stucked or remain behind especially in combat- The combat system didn't changed to much, sometimes is getting very annoying because the creatures or NPCs can que multiple attacks and even at a higher level you can die easily.

												This game could be great - it is worse than gothic and risen, but still is interesting and I really enjoyed the time I spent with this game..... Until there was a bug and I was unable to finish the main quest and would have to go back 2-3 hours back to try again. It is unbelievable how mad I am now. And, unfortunately, it is a common bug appearing in Risen 2. What a shame, this game could be really something...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You can choose on how you build your character: using blades (2 kinds) and/or firearms (2 kinds) and/or fists and/or Voodoo. You can also have some tricky tricks by throwing sand or breathing fire... You earn glory (experience) every time you defeat an opponent or finish a quest. Glory is used to level up your attributes and some attributes levels are required to buy and learn new skills. You can also find ""legendary"" treasures that will boost your stats or making a brewage of some rare plants to increase some talents.So more you go through the story more you unlock crew members that have their own skills, you can have one crew member at time with you to help you in your journey. (The others guard the boat) You can set sail to many island, fight many animal or human foes...Well this game is really awesome, even if some part used in fight can miss often as you may not have the skills needed. (firearms, cunning or voodoo?)You also have some mini games. (drinking game, duels and shooting game)(*) :Only one bad thing happens to the PC game I may guess, all of the stats (kills, treasures found, lock picks) are lost every time you close the game. BUT the good thing is that you can reload one save file as many time as you want until you get an achievement related to the stats shown above. I suggest you to refer to the achievements guide.

												Risen 1 was disappointing. Don't get me wrong. It was a definition of the Gothic style. Risen 1 joined the best bits from the first two Gothic titles, giving us the perfect Gothic game gameplay wise and implementing a load of great ideas. Even the lore and the plot was a mix of first two Gothic games with changed names and details. I had a ton of fun playing and re-playing it. The disappointment came from the fact, that Piranha Bytes made once a good game - that is Gothic 2 (which is the fixed Gothic 1) and is too incompetent to make anything else. So they copied everything that they made in the past. They learned from the mistake Gothic 3 was.Or did they? No. Because now they decided to make their own BioWare role playing wanna be; just like they tried to jump on an Oblivion band wagon with Gothic 3. Don't try to pull BS that was not the whole point. The whole game screams with crippled cinematic drama in the style of mass effect or worse - dragon age. The sole concept of trying the whole ""bond to the characters"" in a game just to jump on a popular bandwagon of ""bioware way"" is the root of the failure Risen 2 came out to be. No one expected PB to pull a such BS, because their target audience never wanted that from their games. The Steelbeard's death scene was the peak of failure Risen 2 was story wise.What else? The game itself was a chore, unfinished cluster♥♥♥♥, suffering not only because of the failed design choice of making ""our own bioware rpg"", but from everything else. The lore, the world structure, characters, combat, the character progress, crafting, exploration crappy engine with BS graphics (remember the horrendous flora pop-ups?) - everything was broken beyond repair.The combat was ♥♥♥♥, it's not up for a dispute. Useless melee, laughable cunning that didn't even work as intended (the parrot was the majestic way to loose your character points). Overpowered AS ♥♥♥♥ fire-arms that turned the game into boring shoot-a-crap marathon until you encountered the last boss. Which went down from 3 shots. Yeah, talk about difficulty curve or balanced character progression in this game. Feeble magic raplecement in form of a voodoo, which was mind boggling useless gimmick - I bet no one even bothered with testing that ♥♥♥♥ after being coded, they just threw it to the bag and realeased it without checking if it works. I refuse to accept the fact this crap was pulled out with a full knowledge from a developer: ""yeah this plays out nicely and as intended!"" No, the voodoo just didn't work. Dolls were useless and hardly did much, they were used only once and they costed a fortune. Possesion hex? Yeah, go ahead, hex that monkey and watch it fight another monkey for 30 minutes, because mobs tend to kite themselves endlessly. This ♥♥♥♥ only looked promising when the game told you that you can posses NPCs. Hey, that can work just fine! I thought and oh God was I wrong. A gimmick used once or two in the whole game, bugged as well. What a ♥♥♥♥ing farce this game was combat-wise. Do you remember game telling you to dodge while fighting animals? Yeah, but there was no actual dodge move in the ♥♥♥♥ing game. The patch came out week or more after the release. How ♥♥♥♥ing ignorant and incompetent you have to be to let a such cluster♥♥♥♥ to be released? It was even worse than a broken Gothic 1 combat.Crafting? You didn't need to craft anything, until you decided to struggle with a broken melee, then you will need one crafted sword - to roll everything on your path with 2 hits, with your finger up your ♥♥♥. The world structure and exploration? Yeah, but - no in this game. Everyone loved Gothic games and Risen 1 for the illusion of a living world. Every NPC had their day routine, his/her house, some even travelled through the world. It was ♥♥♥♥ing marvelous in Gothic 1. It still is, after all these years. Risen 1 kept that achievement of the PB studio, but in a less scale. But it was still there and no one was complaining. What do we have in Risen 2? A pirate theme that forces the game world to be divided into islands. Ok. But the most of the islands are so ♥♥♥♥ing small, on two you can even see the other side of them. Islands are full of NPCs, but the small sizes of environment made impossible to give them all their own place or even a daily routine. Most NPCs just stand there day and night, having nothing to do. Only few can boast with their own beds. It's a such ♥♥♥♥ing step back I don't need to comment further. You loved previous games for different guilds, ways to progress your character? Forget that, you're a pirate here all the way, working for nobody! Hunting Mara, killing Earth Titan with a fart! Wearing the same tricorne hat for 90% of the ♥♥♥♥ing game. You loved changing your armour and weapon over and over in previous Gothic games, but keeping them, feeling they're more valueable than any price trader can offer? Sorry, you will wear some dirty pirate rags for a whole game. If you got yourself a ""dlc"" outfit, you will keep it for 99% of the game. By ""get it"" I mean literally get it via a console, because Risen 2 is also an excellent example of DLC scam policy, where a publisher blocks a retail disc content and demands money for unlocking it (and the studio was too incompetent to block it properly and you can access all the content via console downloading nothing). Exploration? A good joke in Risen 2. The chest loot is ♥♥♥♥ing level-scaled, which is a unforgiveable crime if you were looking for a Gothic game. Yeah, go struggle to open that chest. Here, have few coins and a bottle of rum. You want to jump freely and explore for ♥♥♥♥? Remember jumping on the roofs in Khorinis? Climbing the ♥♥♥♥ing mountains in Gothic 3? Sorry, your pirate character can't swim even in a ♥♥♥♥ing lake, he's a stiff dude also. You can only climb specified rock ledges, which are hilariously out of place and you spot them from 100m ahead (that being often a half of the island you're on). A reward of finding a ""hidden"" chest? Have a rock and get lost to watch another shoveled down drama cinematic or listen to that ♥♥♥♥ingly annoying gnome that screams over and over ""♥♥♥♥ yes"". Also, being the game about PIRATES ARRRRRR, having ALL SHIPS to LOOK EXCACTLY THE ♥♥♥♥ING SAME is beyond my mind. Even A ♥♥♥♥ING GHOST SHIP looks the same like every other in the game, even your own. Enemies? ♥♥♥♥ you, have a gorilla, a huge spider and uninspired undead guardians. That is all. Remember orc armies, demons, mad cultists, ♥♥♥♥ing dragons, and so on? Haha, you will see non here. But wait! Maybe you will fight that kraken everyone in the game ♥♥♥♥♥ their pants on? ♥♥♥♥ you - a kraken fight was a joke, having to shoot tentacles that posed no threat just before fighting Mara. The most dangerous enemies were boars at the beginning and NPCs enemies you needed to fight melee early due to broken combat. That kraken couldn't kill a ♥♥♥♥ing monkey you fought 10 hours earlier.

Product received for free
Risen 2: Dark Waters ReviewQuick-View Substantiation Risen 2 is a pirate based open-world, role-playing, an adventure game that takes place in the fortress of the Inquisition. The main enemy of the Inquisition is called Titan Lords. Titan Lords are rather gods which have been cast into the sea . The gods became angry once pirates started turning on each other; now there is a great war between the Titans and pirates. In fact, a goddess named Mara controls the seas and the ocean currents. We could call her, the goddess of the seas much like Poseidon who sends judgment on everyone and causes the rainwaters to pour out from underneath the earth. Our mission is simple, go on the Black Betty which is a ship that takes you to Tacarigua, blend in with the prisoners, and mention nothing about us linked to the Inquisition. Our fate if we go back on our word is death.      The shipping area in Tacarigua houses prisoners that are taken away to slave ships and shipped out under merciless conditions. While Risen 2 is a Caribbean pirate game full of adventure, enemy encounters, loot, and new discoveries through talking to non-playable characters, it gives you a choice through a set of dialogue options to control your path you take. You can become either a hospitable guy or you can become a smart aleck, arrogant fool in front of others that will quite literally, school you in the art of fighting, defense mechanisms. Others, you can steal from storekeepers storehouses, but you will be penalized because all of them will try to duel you.   Presentation     In any open-world based adventure, role-playing game, the presentation is one of the most important features to determine whether the game can live on. In Risen 2: Dark Waters we have a beautiful Caribbean outpost in the main game with a tower, well-done steps, a beach with caves here and there, an ocean full of war-like ships with realistic wave physics, build construction. It transports you to places you cannot always go in real-life but would want to see. For example, not everyone lives on a beach or a shore in their daily life. The main character is quite arrogant, and he can get drunk on some days. However, the majority of the presentation centers around going back and forth between non-playable characters and quest logs to find where to go next as well as any more information you may have missed along the way. Sometimes there are things you can collect on the beach such as provisions you can turn into shopkeepers in exchange for other goods and gold.      However, at times, as in the case early on in the game, they will be stingy and have you get the gold from somewhere else. One example is in the first area where we have to find the barrels and crates on the beach that were left over provisions washed up on the beach shore after a Kraken took one of the ships down  looking from the tower of the outpost with our conversation with Carlos. Hard rainwater falls down, and caves are silent with enemies hidden under its foregrounds such as the Sand Devils, the first enemy we come across. These Sand Devils are nasty creatures; they are low in the ground and act like beetles trying to thrust their weight in front of us only for intimidation. Even worse, is they hide on the side and usually appear in groups which can kill us easily if not careful. Combat     Combat is basic as in most pirate games would be. You start out with a simple dagger and a pistol. The pistol is far less efficient on most enemies because, later on, as a pirate, you will either use your basic sword or a variation of the base sword you are given. We can parry back and forth between enemies and clash our metal on their thick skulls. One major drawback is our first enemy, the Sand Devils. Parry is non-effective on Sand Devils because they travel in groups. They will attack you with more force when you never parry, which this forces you to constantly attack until they all die which is a larger risk at times before you have any chance of leveling up in Risen 2: Dark Waters.      The key bindings for keyboard controls feel awkward; it is tied to capslock by default for running, but you have to keep capslock on the whole time while you are running. Otherwise, it will switch off again. Then, you will have to reinitiate capslock to sprint each time again. Also, the sneak key binding feels awkward and unusual, more so, hard to reach. I recommend you try to invest in a good controller for this specific game since it is open-world; you want to be comfortable for when you have to either walk or run long distances when fulfilling mission objectives and side quests for people. Otherwise, the combat is relatively simple compared to other games in this genre. Performance     Options in the main menu range in degree of anti-aliasing, anisotropic filtering, the ability to turn water reflections on, off and the level of detail in shadows, depth of field, landscape, texture, foliage, shader, object detail. However, the main drawback is the lack of capabilities with a variety of different compatibility modes for the personal computer version. It originally ran on both Windows XP and Windows Vista operating system; however, it struggles with Windows 10 especially. I have tried reverting it back to compatability mode for Windows 7 yet my journey in doing so has been to no further avail. I am not the only person with this problem because this has occurred since the release of Windows 10 and still persists. I doubt that the developer Piranha Bytes will fix this since the game came out in 2012 on the personal computer.      It is a shame too because the textures are in very great detail; they look straight out of a movie which could be compared to Treasure Planet and Pirates of the Caribbean.  Overall Verdict – 6- Solid     While Risen 2: Dark Waters is a solid game within an open-world Caribbean environment, it falls short of being great. The storyline is solid but takes a long time to build up proper action. The earlier battles are mundane without offering the adrenaline based pumped action we would expect if this game was made into a movie with a similar setting. The voice acting is superb but is not movie based quality which I was expecting from a game published by Deep Silver because they have never disappointed in that field of work. However, Piranha Bytes does include some very nice tropes and notable references to other pirate theme games can be gathered through its exploration. This is a game you should not go buy on a whim on any particular day, but one you should check out if pirate based movies interest you.      It fulfills the need for a very niche audience and a fan base that, simply, will not be for everyone. Are you that person that wants a pirate fantasy open-world role-playing game, or better yet, do you prefer Assassin’s Creed because of its stellar combat, better settings, along with better voice acting and graphics when it comes to pirate themed games? The choice is all yours. Risen 2 uses many pop culture references to The Chronicles of Narnia, such as the Kraken enemy; a war going on between light and darkness and deciding whether you will side with the good guys, the inquisition in this case, or the Titans, the evil that permeates through the oceans. In The Chronicles of Narnia, it is rather the evil witch or Aslan which represents Jesus’s sacrifice as a Lion.Disclaimer     A review copy of Risen 2: Dark Waters was provided by Gamephasis.

												I hunted down some escaped slaves froma sugar plantation and cut their heads off. I thought that maybe the game would give me a less colonial racist way to handle the savages, however they all attacked me so I pretty much had to kill them.Anyway, this is not Risen. Risen was a lot of fun and really hard, this is entirely different, but still hard. Your magic is gone, now there's voodoo. Risen had some pirates, but it wasn't a pirate game. Risen 2 is a pirate game and I just can't get into it. Maybe it is partially my fault for jumping right into 2 after beating Risen 1, but that shouldn't excuse how bad this game is. You play the same guy from Risen 1, but come on, this game isn't fooling anyone. Badass sword/magic wielding guy is now a drunken one eyed pirate due to the end of Risen 1? No. This feels like they had a game in mind and just let it piggyback on Risen.Go play Risen. It was so good that I had to look into the Gothic games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A quite enjoyable ride!Pros:-Above average storyline-Addicting play once you pass 1 hour milestone-Like the previous game you can shape your game based on your choises on certain factions.Cons:-Not a lot of options to solve quests; just certain skill checks; you can shorten the time that you need to complete the quests by having certain skill in the conversation. Not a contructive way to flesh out options.-Not enough weapon /armor diversity. Even in the late game, most of my armor parts are from Pirate DLC items which are on us from the beginning.-Not enough variance in mobs.-Although you have faction choices, once you select a faction,  the game will become too linear.So; Another decent RPG from Piranha Bytes but I can easily say that it is one step backwards from Risen1. However, If you have no other RPG to play, I can easily recommend Risen2. See you in R3 :).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Holy sh|t !I can't belive this is a sequel of Risen 1 which is a great game. This carp  is a step back ( not just one step, rather a running backwards in a hour ) in every aspect. Bad graphics, bad design, bad interface, bad story telling, ridigous characters and their motivations... I feel that the game is very-very unpolished! The most or even the worst part is the combat system. There is a very good one in Risen 1, but hell knows why, the creators drop out into the trash and made the world's worst combat system i ever seen in a video game... Bonus part: the whole game unbalanced, sometimes you can die because of a butterfly fart ... :/Looks like a work of a bunch of drunken dwarfs ( as if it was made on the basis of a Chinese instructor would video :)...Not worth a coin nor a trading cart... Totally trash! I'am very disapointed. After the first part ( 64 hours of gameplay and done to 100% ) i can't belive this is a sequel of famous Risen 1. :(((UPD: I will finish the game if i spend a lot of money on it :))) I still not like it ( not impossible of play and have some good moments at last ), but before starting part 3 i need to see the endsequence of this ! :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First up, I bought this in a humble bundle and I'm still annoyed at the 20p or percentage of the price I paid went to Risen 2. I must say, this game has to have the most relatively worst combat controls I have had the unfortunate experience to suffer through. Combat feels totally disconnected from pressing buttons, more akin to ordering the character to perform an attack which he will then perform on his own time. Attacking is limited to just spamming the left click, which is mired by long wind up times, as well as enemies not being staggered by your attacks, while they are more than capable of stunlocking you should they even lightly cough on you, which they will do so, far quicker than your attack animation. The only way I felt I could actually attack enemies was to rub myself up against an enemy and clip through them when they thrusted. Animals are even worse, as their attacks are unblockable, as well as un-staggerable. Not only that, but skills that reduce damage taken are limited to only effecting human opponents. So not only can you not block animal attacks, they do far more damage than is feasible, forcing you to hoard potions in order to just soak enemy attacks until you grind them down. Animations are in themselves janky and poor quality, and recycled to a horrendous degree. Human characters talking merely flap their jaws as if they belonged in the 90s, while the camera and characters noticebly constantly reset themselves every line of dialog, causing them to visibly spawn in every 5 seconds during cinematics. Texture and model quality, while not everything is to do with graphics, the level of quality is most definitely sub par for a studio as old as this.Voice acting is poor too, it's better than average in that it actually uses British actors, but they're still pretty pants. Overall a poor and infuriating experience not worth investing in, even if you are desperate for a pirate game like I was.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Risen 2 improves on certain aspects of Risen 1, but takes some pretty serious steps back in other areas.First, graphically, the game is pretty great and an improvement, voice acting is much improved, the story is way better and follows a much more coherent arc, and the general atmosphere is much, much improved. The pirate setting is generally well done and there is plenty of humor.NPC teammates are a nice addition, but one of them is so much better than the others that I doubt most players will spend much time switching between them. A couple of them are painfully boring, and one of them seems to be something of a jarjar binks ripoff in terms of irritating accent, total failure at humor and racist undertones.COMBAT and CHOICE are where this game really fails.Risen 1 had punishing combat that was at first really difficult, until you figured out the enemies' attack patterns and were given proper armour (that game's ""soft"" invisible wall in terms of exploration), at which point all combat pretty much became trivial and tedious. Risen 2 takes any feeling of real flow out of combat by making most enemies' attacks unblockable, which makes combat revolve around spamming attacks and hoping to beat them to the punch. Once you get a rifle, pretty much all combat involves cheesy ""hit and run"" and/or using your teammate as a distraction/tank, while you spam the fire button.There are lots of choices for off-hand weapons and tactics, but because of enemies' total lack of AI and frustrating attack spamming/swarming, none of them are particularly useful. Combat is, in short, broken, tedious and not fun. There is also a lot of it.CHOICE is this game is thankfully not broken like in Risen 1, but rather pointless and badly implemented all the same. You pick a ""faction"" close to the start of the game, but neither has much of an impact on the story other than some changed dialogue, and one different NPC on your ship, neither of which is interesting enough to use throughout the rest of the game, IMHO. This choice also locks you in/out of using either Rifles or Voodoo. Rifles are SO MUCH better than Voodoo that choosing Voodoo amounts to purposely gimping your character. This is a big problem, since Voodoo powers are lots of fun and open up 90% of the (otherwise extremely boring) crafting system. Muskets make all combat extremely easy, however, so picking the fun of voodoo just doesn't make sense since you end up with much more frustrating combat. It would have been great if the devs had allowed you to learn all talents and mix the voodoo with the rifles.Character progression is nicely handled, but other than the Voodoo/Musket choice, I think most players will end up putting points into exactly the same skills, since a handful of them (lockpicking especially) are necessities, and the rest are no-brainers. In the end, it's a very shallow system, but could be a template for a great skill system in the hands of better developers.This game will really leave a ""low budget game"" bad taste in your mouth. There are lots of corners cut, the devs don't seem to have a very easy time using the game engine (i think it's based on unreal engine) as there are some awkward animations, draw distances and fake physics, and while certain aspects of the voice acting are great, others are horrible and/or too repetitive in the Morrowind kind of sense of every non-major NPC having one of 2 voices. Walking into deep water causes the screen to briefly go black before you're teleported back to where you're standing, certain kills have a Fallout 3 style slow motion finish in which your weapon will never actually make contact with your victim and most textures will be see-through, and NPCs in general have too few lines and don't react to your exploits/the changing world in any meaningful way.I'll also mention that, while the devs are known for ""open world"" games like Risen 1 and Gothic, this game is painfully linear for the first 35% of the game, then gives you a bioware-style choice of what order the next 3 small ""hubs"" will be tackled in, follwed by the final 20% of the game being linear.I left this game running accidentally overnight at one point, and would estimate that game took me in all about 20-25 hours to beat, including the DLC.A special note regarding the DLC: The ""Air Temple"" is horrible and tedious, while ""Treasure Island"" is simply below-average, boring DLC. Niether adds anything to the game (air temple is so bad that it actually takes away from the rest of the game, in my opinion, even though it adds an NPC from Risen 1 who some fans might appreciate).All in all, I can only recommend this game if you've replayed Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyborn so many times that you're sick of them, have multiple playthroughs of all Bioware RPG's and Witcher games under your belt, and don't have any higher quality or more original games in your backlog. Of course, if you're a HUGE fan of pirates, by all means try it out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I read the reviews for this game before I started. That being said, I expected it to be a broken piece of crap. It wasn't. The graphics are great, the soundtrack is great. Mechanics are not great but still GOOD. Story is awesome. Nothing in the game was broken. It's fun. Try it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I would say this is very decent game, with good story,acceptable graphic and visuals...Games biggest problem is fighting/combat.It's difficult, but not impossible...You start game with nothing, and as Inquisition soldier....you know absolutely nothing...But when you play more you will start to understand how game works...but then it will be boring...Overall game is OK...it's not great...it's playable...

												As a big fan of the original game, Risen, this game was a large disappointment. It lingers far away from what made Risen good, and tries to do something different, which I can respect, but it just doesn't work. The game is incredibly unforgiving at early levels and the overall combat system feels lacking and unfinished. Graphically, it is a large improvement over the original, however that's all. It pales in comparison to the original in terms of gameplay. Just get the original and get the full Risen experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Background I played Risen when it was released back in 2009 and had a great time with it.  The game was very rough around the edges, and combat at the beginning of the game was absolutely brutal.  But, the game shone brightly with its immense draw distances, enjoyable dialog, and rewarding exploration.  Risen 2: Dark Waters maintains all of these characteristics. Story and Setting This is a pirate-themed RPG.  Expect pirate things.  I've seen several complaints that Risen 2's take on buccaneering is ""generic,"" such as in Kevin Van Ord's review for Gamespot.  This is an absurd criticism.  A pirate-theme needs certain aspects, such as excessive cursing, buried treasure, tavern wenches, and unnecessarily agressive swashbucklers.  Risen 2 does all of these things, and I think it does them fairly well.The story rarely references the Unnamed Hero's previous adventure in Risen, though the grandstoryline of warring Titans continues.  The main villian is a female Titan named Mara.  The storytelling failed big time here, in my opinion.  Mara is seen only three times during the game.  Characters constantly talk about how terrible she is, but little is done to make the player feel Mara's impact. Characters and Voice Acting I think the voice acting in Risen 2 is consistently excellent.  The pirates sound really harsh and gruff.  There is one voice actor who did both pirate and Inquisition voices who I absolutely love.  I can't recall him voicing any major characters, unfortuantely.  Commandant Sebastiano's actor is amazing.  He speaks with sophistication and vigor.  I recognized his highly distinctive voice on some random NPCs.There are many, many characters to speak with in Risen 2.  I enjoyed the dialog in this game very much. Combat Combat in this game is pretty bad, overall.  It is extremely bad for the first 10 hours, as you have very few moves.  Enemies hit extremely hard and have a lot of health.  The first Risen game was like this too, though by midgame it evened out, and in the late game you became an unstoppable god.  I had the same experience with Risen 2.  At least in this game there are companions to help with combat.  They can tank enemies very effectively, so don't be ashamed to let them do so.  Cheesing fights with terrain exploits shouldn't shame you either.  The fights are THAT difficult.  If you stick with it, by end game you will be able to destroy entire taverns full of drunk and angry pirates.I played the voodoo path rather than the musket path, since it seemed far more interesting that firing a gun.  Voodoo has some very good stuff going for it, such as scepters to make enemies fight eachother, tremor in fear, or summon a permanent ghost companion.  Even so, it seems underdeveloped.  The Ritual (potions) talent was completely useless to me, other than creating improved permanent stat-booster elixirs. Graphics I had the pleasure of playing Risen 2 both in 2560x1440 and 1080p stereoscopic 3D.  The game runs very well with 3D Vision after disabling water reflections and shadows.  The lush jungles were an absolute treat in 3D, where each tree and each leaf helps to give the sense of a rich 3D world.  The draw distance is unlimited... there is no fogging whatsoever.But, the graphics have many technical issues.  Level of detail changes cause trees to ""grow"" and the ground/rocks to change shape as you move through areas. Textures are consistenly low resolution.  When a canned execution animation plays, the Unnamed Hero's neck distorts horrifically.  Animations are poor across the board, really.I have seen absolutely ridiculous criticisms of the Risen series as having poor graphics that don't improve across installments.  Risen 2 is a major improvement over Risen 1, and Risen 3: Titan Lords obviously looks better than Dark Waters.  The graphics are definitely flawed, but the engine pushes DirectX 9 to its limits. Conclusion I had a great time with Risen 2.  I play video games less and less as the years go on, and Risen 2 was the first in a while to hook me into very long play sessions.  I will definitely be picking up Risen 3, but I just spent 43 hours in Risen 2, so I'll take a break before diving in.I recommend the Risen series to people who can appreciate a hardcore RPG experience.  There is a lot of ""jankiness"" in Risen games, but I really wouldn't have it any other way.  There's a charm to NPCs that instantly repeat their lines before finishing if you spam-click them.

												Absolutely loved this game. Got fairly obsessed with it over the last week (sorry to my friends who were flooded with screenshots...) and when it came time to beat it I was pretty sad. It has a lot of great gameplay, great storyline and fun characters. It was definitely not a dull game and it's pretty in depth considering all the questing you have to do. I played with the DLCs Air Temple and Treasure Island which I suggest getting. The Pirate Clothes DLC does offer decent EQ, but it's nothing to write home about once you get into the meat of the game. Still somewhat handy after becoming a Pirate.My suggestions for others looking to play this game is to use a guide. You can easily get quests mixed up which will lock you out of completing or even participating in others. Save often in case this happens so you can go back and not have to spend hours toiling to get to the same spot you left off of.This also applies to if you are an achievement hound like I can be and want to 100% this game. It is possible, but there are decisions that can affect whether you get a certain achievement or not. Again - save at critical points. The game only allows you 10 save files (afaik), but if you are smart about it, that should be enough. Another heads up with achievements, certain ones the counter will reset to 0 once you completely exit the game. But achievements will count multiple save files, so at least there's that. (kill, reload, repeat!)Overall, if you love RPGs, Pirates, Questing and Monster killing - this is the game for you.And just FYI, it does have some rough edges which didn't bother me in the least but I am sure other players might find to be hinderances. The game play can be a bit clunky and there are some glitches, but, as I mentioned before, using a guide at least for reference will save you a lot of hair from being ripped out.Update: I just finished Risen and it was fantastic. This game is still my favorite and I really, really wish it had been longer because I love Pirate Captain Nameless Hero so dang much.I did notice a couple of inconsistencies in story line between the two games but it was so minor they aren't even worth mentioning. Plus it gives y'all something to look out for. ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Note: Copy-Paste from my review of Risen 1. You shouldn't play Risen 2 without having played Risen 1. Personal rating: 8/10Replayability: MediumBudget: Worth it. Lenght: A few days to a week. Risen 2 specific notes: Risen 2, apart from what I have to say about the series in general below, has a slightly clumsy combat system, and feels like a partial attempt at making a Sid-Meyer's Pirates! inspired RPG, but remains a very good game. I'm not sure what to think of Risen. The company behind Risen made Gothic, a series that I loved. Gothic has a tragic story, funding was cut from the expansion pack to the third installment, resulting in a buggy game that felt unfinished, and had the wrong voice-actors. The dreaded fourth installment that the orginal company wasn't even part of, killed the series, and I hear this is why they started Risen on the side. While I was initially excited about Risen, I feel like Risen is some sort of attempt from the company's side to ""win back"" their original ideas for gothic. It feels like they're trying to make the same game, but different. Still, Risen has a decent story, but Risen is a series, and the third installment just game out. I'll try not to judge Risen 1 on the sequels, but it's hard, because frankly Risen 2 feels like they retconned a lot of Risen 1 in an attempt to reboot their franchise as a sort of ""pirate age"" age game, even though it clearly felt like a high-fantasy gothic medieval game in the first installment. Separately though, the games are quite good, it's just a bit of a snag to get over how poorly they connect, despite several characters making appearances in both games. In many ways, Risen perfectly embodies the spirit of Gothic and does provide some not-seen-before elements. Where in Gothic, you felt like you were the nameless master-mind behind a gang of anti-heroes who follow you out of some misguided sense of loyalty (honor among thieves, I guess) rather than true friendship, always facing challenges in a hostile world as you go about, in Risen you feel like people actually have a more ""human"" relationship towards you. Sure, you're still a nameless guy but apart from a select few individuals, you're truly alone this time, but your friendships in the game are based on actual frienship, meaning the character actually has some relationships with people. Risen in no way beats or threatens the legacy of the 3 real gothic games, but if you liked gothic, you NEED to play Risen too. Fun fact: Many fans believe that unofficially, Risen is set several years in the future of the original gothic trilogy. Read more on this theory on the internet. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Risen 2 is a weird, confused mess of a game. Its half post-apocalyptic/lovecraftian horror and half swashbuckling lighthearted pirate adventure and neither of the two meet to make a solid whole. Throughout the 30 or so hours of the game, both sides seem like totally different things, with the pirate adventure taking up the lions share of the spotlight.Risen 2 also continues on with Risen's goal of simplifying mechanics that date all the way back to the Gothic games. Fast travel and a more robust XP system cause Risen 2 to move more towards the Action RPG archetype at times. This isn't to say that all the complexity has been bred out of Risen 2, the Learning Points system still exists, mostly, but is instead gated by Glory (XP) and knowledge level of the five character attributes. This more or less works, but something is definitely lost in translation and Risen 2's gameplay begins to feel more like generic RPG systems instead of the interesting systems in Gothic and Risen.The combat loop in Risen 2 is also vastly simplified and the game is overall orders of magnitude more easier then it's predecessors, with the more thoughtful combat systems in both Risen and the Gothic games replaced with hack'n'slash mechanics. I got through the entire game just mashing on the attack button and peridocally shooting people while mashing on my health position hotkey during the few times i was in peril. Overall, it's nowhere near as satisfying as the previous games, which made you *work* to survive encounters with even basic enemies. Also, you can still get stunlocked to death in Risen 2, so at least there is some connective tissue to the previous games!Storywise, the game takes a *lot* of inspiration from the Pirates of the Caribbean ride/movies, especially in it's use of voodoo and pirate curses as a main story theme. The nameless character from Risen has become a Inquisition officer in the years between the games and resides in the Crystal Fortress in Caldera, the last human city of the 'Old World' after all the previous ones have been destoryed by not only Titans themselves, but also a cataclysmic conflict between the Titan Lords, one of which the main character helped resurrect and free in the previous game. Humanity stands on the brink of annihilation due to being unable to fight back against the Titans *and* Titan Lords, especially Mara, a Titan, and her kraken, who holds the Southern Seas and has sent countless ships to the bottom of the sea, which means that supplies and fresh troops are dangerously low in Caldera. After a ship heading for the Crystal Fortress is destroyed by Mara's kraken, Patty, a somewhat important character from Risen, washes up on the shores and teams up with the nameless character after he is told to go undercover as a pirate to investigate rumors of weapons that are capable of killing Mara that are held by Steelbeard, Patty's estranged father. The story is serviceable and does the job of providing a reason to go on a grand adventure, but there was never a point where I cared at all about the events of the game, especially considering the immense tone whiplash that I got after coming off the first game. It honestly feels like Piranha Bytes had one team making an actual sequel to Risen and another making a pirate RPG and they just smushed the two together. A lot of characters that previously existed in Risen act nothing like their former incarnations, with the main character being the most egregious example.Graphically, the game is capable of some really nice jungle environments and some great lighting, but most of the time it looks very average, especially in terms of very average looking character models and animations. There is nothing here that will push your hardware to the max or make your jaw drop, and I was comfortably able to run it on max settings without breaking a sweat. The art style is nothing to write home about as well, there was nothing notable at all except for the aforementioned jungle environments. The most offensive thing I can think of in terms of the graphical features is that lighting in caves and ruins is exceptionally poor. It attempts to convey a dark environment, but instead just causes me to be unable to see, even with torches. I had to increase the brightness just to see what I was doing in these areas.One important thing to note too is that I ran into many bugs playing this game. During all 35 hours of play, I was never able to either make a hard save through the menu or use the console without the game instantly crashing to desktop. I still have no idea what causes this and googling and asking around brings no fixes. There were also bugs with some achievements never triggering, non-critical items never spawning and things like that. I used the Risen 2 Unofficial Patch, which purports to fix many non-critical issues with quests and the like, but I still ran into these problems, so be aware.Also, Risen 2 has some gross bits in it, especially with the way native peoples are portrayed in the game, where they basically just took every existing colonialist 'tribal' stereotype in media and smooshed them all into one, kinda offensive mess.  There is also some blatant homophobia with one character that seems incredibly unnecessary. Overall, I did actually have fun with this game, but it is also a very average game when examined critically. If you are hankering for a game with pirate adventures in it and you have exhausted everything to do in Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag, give this a whirl. It has some charm to it, but it's not gonna be a game that you fondly remember after you finish it.

												You should play this game if you meet the following requirements:- you're lucky enough to get the game working on the first try- you are willing to do much of reinstalling, updating and verifying- you don't care about achievements- you don't use quick save every 30 seconds+ great environmental details, landscapes, day/night cycle and weather+ Jaffar,♥♥♥♥♥yes!- not so great voice acting- few of the nice elements like sand, parrots and powder barrels weren't enough to make the dull and repetitive combat more dynamic- the cutscenes aiming to be dramatic ended up being ridiculous- story was rather unremarkable and the whole world coulda been a bit more unique and more creative- Kraken fight, really?- this game doesn't replace quicksaves so make sure you have a good 10-15gb room for them- it's weirdly disconnected from steam, so you'll have to work hard to get any of the 'do this x times"" achievementsRpgs are my life and I love the pirate theme, but this game just didn't work for me. I hear Risen 3 is much better. Onto it.			",123,102,0,38,20,0,14

												I liked the first Risen.  Having said that, I can't reccomend this game at any price.  It in no way improves upon the original (which surelly could have used a lot of improvements).  The big annoying thing, is that the frame-rate of this game sucks.  I have a beefy system and no other game has any issues.  The frame rate of this game drops the longer you play it.  When I first run it, I get a good framerate, but by the 30 min mark, it has gotten quite slow.If you played the original Risen, you know how awful the sword / melee mechanics were.  Beleive it or not, this game is MUCH worse.  They also got rid of the old magic system (which wasn't that good) and replaced it with something far worse.It is a shame, because I did like the original despite it flaws.  This new one is just a big mess and I reccomend that you stay away from it.			",173,37,0,73,40,0,75

												Risen 1 was good, not perfect, but good. This might be the first game when PB ( the developers) goes away from the gothic formula. This game has  new mechanics which more or less work...But they delete  elements from the first game like shield blocking against animals, magic(replaced by voodoo spells), archery replaced by some guns which  are alright (I quess)-Voodoo spells are mostly use to make some story missions a lot easier, sometimes in combat but they aren't game changing, kinda a wasted effort but the story bits were cool.-Hand guns are used like in MMORPGs , click on something and you have a chance to crit/miss. I don't have a big experience with muskets.-Story-wise the plot from the first game is kinda ♥♥♥♥ed and no one basically gave a damn, there is a wiki page with the backstory from the developers but besides that this game tolds a whole different story. BUT I kinda liked this story more, the dialogues are funnier.-Combat is ...bad. It's more of the *click click click* thing than the *swing right block swing left advance dodge*. Sometimes you lose without even knowing what you did wrong. There is a block button but it's mediocre at best.Overall while not a very good I think is something worth your time : especially if you get the chance to get the whole risen pack with like 15$ like I did.6/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The story is fine, although I didn't play the first one. It was sometimes frustrating because it was slow at loading and had to save too many times while fighting, and also the game ran slow on my computer. But the gameplay was good, the story wasn't exactly short and upgrading skills took time. But after the final fight, you can't do anything, so if you missed some missions you have to load your last savefile  before going to the Water Temple . But it's overall a nice game. 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have to say I quite liked this game even if I am not so much into pirate themes. The first game in the series is one of the better RPG's I have played in recent years, so ofcourse I had to delve into the sequel. Not quite as good as Risen 1 but still entertaining!I would have liked to know a little bit more about the story and what occured between the games, mainly the background concerning some of the main characters and the antagonist. Several years have apparently passed according to the game description. A little is explained here and there, and in the loading screens, but I have would have liked to know more. Pros?Nice gfx, Humorous dialogue exchanges, voodoo (even though mostly useless)Cons?For some reason, not quite as captivating as Risen 1 (personal taste only). Some minor bugs here and there but nothing really noteworthy in my opinion that ruins the experience. I also used Risen 2 modstarter (downloadable from the web) to get a community patch and to fix some small issues, mainly graphic related. Other than that - no crashes and rather stable on my system. Pcgamingwiki.com is a good a place to go if you have problems with games in general. Risen 2 included.Verdict: 7.5/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game totally deviates from the system of the company (Pirahna Byte's) 's previous game series (Gothic), despite the fact that the previous game in the same series played out in almost exactly the same way.Risen 1 was a challenging but very functional and very enjoyable open-world action rpg. The combat could be difficult and frustrating, but if you took the time to figure things out there was a good way to handle every situation.In Risen 2 they completely trash the functional combat Risen 1 had in exchange for a combat system where all you do is wail on the enemy until they fall over, or else run away until the cooldown on your gun is over and then just shoot, rinse & repeat. The timing and different methods of attack don't factor in significantly because regular methods of dealing damage don't have a notable effect.Risen 1 is a very enjoyable shout-out to a classic rpg series (Gothic), Risen 2 is a piece of crap.

												With Risen 3 just over a month away, I thought I'd add my input for anyone who might pick this up, expecting to get an impression of the series. Warning: this is a long review, so for a brief summary, just skip to the end paragraph.The original Risen was, fundamentally, a sound, well-executed, and generally enjoyable fantasy RPG experience, if a bit unimagined and simple. It had everything that made the studio (Piranha Bytes) known in the fantasy RPG market, including memorable NPC's with dynamic behaviors and daily routines to give the game world an organic, living setting. The combat system was decent, but a bit glitchy, and magic offered an interesting, varied complement to combat and exploration. While mostly taking place in a single outdoor landmass, the game also transitioned (seamlessly, I might add) to deep, ruined dungeons which stretched from brief to expansive, and all very nicely designed.Risen 2: Dark Waters lost a lot of that. Abandoning the medieval fantasy theme for a pirate setting, and giving up the single landmass for individual islands separated by loading screens, it's not wrong of you to expect a game with a lot of open-sea activities and exploration and loot-filled adventure. That's not what you get. You find yourself on foot the entire time, running around tiny islands that you soon realize are even smaller than they appear due to deliberate landscape design, turning what could be immersive wilderness exploration into a boring run along pathways between mountains and rocky cliff faces. Dungeons are small, tubular caves or cookie-cutter ruined hallways that rarely yield memorable loot.Whereas previous games from Piranha Bytes gave us NPC's that we could laugh at and remember, there's very little to make us like the batch of characters in this title. Patty, the supposed ""love interest"" of the player character, is the most expressive NPC by far, but is still a pretty generic representation of a typical pirate fantasy trope of a female character trying to prove her strength and independence amongst the tough, grizzled men in the piratey world. The follower Bones offered a bit of humor, but apart from that, I couldn't care less about the characters. Only four NPC's (including Patty) make the crossover between Risen and Risen 2, and two of those characters only appear in the DLC's, and none of them truly reflect their former selves, so anyone whom you might have loved and hoped to see from Risen won't be here.The combat system is what drives many people to complain about this game. In the beginning, I can certainly agree with them - until you get some of the upper-tier skills, which allow you to parry and counter enemy attacks, you're left only with the ability to spam the attack button and hope that everything else dies before you do. The bigger problem is getting those skills. The opening area of the game, Tacarigua, encourages you to invest in a wide variety of skills, but there is no chance of you getting them all so soon - learning skills requires not only levelling up your stats, but paying teachers a huge sum to instruct you, and gold is not easily acquired this early in the game. By the time you get the upper tier combat skills, you'll be used to spamming attacks and depending on your followers, so you may never actually discover how useful parrying and riposting really is.On the topic of skills, you can safely ignore about half of the skills the game offers. Many of them have such selective usefulness in so few occasions that they aren't worth investing in at all. Partway through the game, you're forced to make a decision that decides what skills will be open to you later - either being able to use muskets, or voodoo magic. Voodoo may sound like the more attractive option, but in my experience, it's almost completely worthless. Many enemies later in the game are immune to the spells, and potions are such short-term buffs that they're a waste of time to fuss with. Still, it hardly matters which side you choose, because even if you forego muskets for voodoo, you can still use shotguns (or 'shotgun,' since I think only one exists in the game), which function exactly the same.The only one thing I can actually give credit to this game for is the ""legendary items"" feature. Starting with the expansion for Gothic II, Piranha Bytes has included a series of hidden treasures in each of their games to seek out and dig up. Risen included pieces of broken weapons that could be reforged into powerful swords. This was included in Risen 2 as well, but the game also featured legendary items that could be read about in books found throughout the settlements of the world, and offered clues leading to special items giving passive perks to your character. This feature was the only thing that made the islands truly worth exploring, as the majority of loot you found in dungeons and the landscape was little more than fodder to dump onto a vendor for a quick buck.All in all, Risen 2: Dark Waters fails in its promise to give us the first true pirate RPG. It fails to give us an endearing RPG experience of any kind, in fact. Calling it ""streamlined"" is too forgiving, as the whole game is woefully shallow; with an assortment of useless skills to waste money on, small, unimagined islands that offer little incentive to explore, and characters that, at best, are simply mind-numbing caricatures of the common stereotypes of Hollywood pirates. This title is an offense to the legacy of Piranha Bytes, and it fills me with dread to know that the developers of four quintessential RPG's could sink this low. Here's hoping Risen 2 was a bitter lesson for the studio, and while I expect RIsen 3: Titan Lords to have some of the same flaws (with their shortest development time so far, I can't expect it to be a complete turn-around), I can only hope we see some signs of life in the future to indicate that they can provide us with another beloved RPG for the ages.

												        Risen 2 is a third-person RPG that made me spend a lot of time on it. You are a former Inquisition soldier that travels from nearly destroyed Caldera across the seas to various islands. The setting is quite immersive: Carribean-like islands, treasure hunt, grave plundering, pirate fights, the Creed....all of that you can experience here. The more you talk to the people in the game, the more details of story and quests you discover. From the drinking adventurer at the beginning to the captain of your own ship  in the end you will fight Mara using four artifacts that you have to get from each captain. 	At first sight, the plot is distinct, linear but during the playthrough lots of interesting quests and events emerge. The goal of the game is to get all four artifacts to fight against the “she-devil” Mara. Each artifact has special means to be acquired. You will have to fight against titans, escape from the island after being marooned by one of the captains, build a raft with the help of gnomes and reveal the mascarade of another captain who killed the Inquisition soldiers and used their robes to gain trust from the Marakayas.  The game is filled with lots of side-quests.  A part of these quests suggest different wayouts due to your talents or your personal attitude. Points of glory that you get for fighting and completing tasks help you improve your skills. You can be a trickster, a fighter, a brute or a voodoo master. Better choose from the beginning what type of skills you will develop the most.  Hence, you can either intimidate or flatter people or simply do a point-blank shoot (if a script suggests) and many more.  Also it is worth mentioning that you can get such useful abilities as kicking over opponents, training monkeys and parrots to steal things and distract foes. There are some unique collectibles that require from you having certain of  the above mentioned abilities to get them.  Other abilities include the use of a voodoo doll to take direct control of other characters or rituals to weaken opponents. But the most hilarious tricks are breathing fire in the opponent's face, scattering sand in the eyes and dropping coconuts. This one was one of the highlights for me. Thorough exploration also awards you with unique items and treasure maps. The more gold you get, the more skills you can master from trainers all over the playground. Also you can use potions, parts of clothes and weapons that boost your skills. There certainly is a value in replay as the game suggests to play either for the Inquisition or for the local tribes. Personally I preferred learning cunning skills primarily and then slashing and piercing weapons because I rarely use magical skills in RPGs. This helped me open lots of chests, train monkeys and parrots, also complete quests using eloquent speech which was fun for me. The main hero could use sarcasm, jokes or steal gold. Voodoo is also a fun way. It helps you control people after getting some of their personal things and making a voodoo doll. And it unlocks another branch of quests.	There were enough animals and monsters in the game world. After killing them you can use their parts for trading or for magic. But not at once. You must get special tools at first: bone saw, ritual knife and others. The faster you find them, the better. This also encouraged me to explore.	Music and sound effects are decent, I wish there would be more ambient or combat soundtracks though. Sometimes it weakens the desire to play the game. From the other side, the main hero has his own voiceover, unlike in some other RPGs. This is crucial for me, adds an immersion. The best soundtrack is at the moment when the ghost of Captain Steelbeard appears at the Island of the Dead. Moreover, every companion that goes with you during the quests may also add some witty sentences in the cutscenes. Generally, the voiceover of the main characters is good. I appreciated that. Only the animations of body language repeat too much. 	Graphics are demanding. It was hard for me to optimize the game to get normal fps. I sacrificed with draw distance and detail quality, downloaded a small fix that boosts fps from Steam community and changed some values in “ini” files. Then nothing was critical, the game can be completed at 20-25 fps, at dark and foggy places it drops to 15-18 fps on my old PC. I only regret that I could not pass shooting challenge in Antigua because it was impossible to aim and hit targets. Luckily, there was another quest to skip it and played on.	Another problem that I spotted is linked with achievements. Many of them are unlockable. For example, I definitely killed more than 20 giant crabs and unlocked more than 100 chests by the end of the game, but these achievements just do not pop up. Neither in game, nor in Steam and there is almost a dozen of them. Playing hours do not count properly too. My last save file has around 40 hours, Steam shows 19 or so.		Nevertheless, I kept hooked on this game because I tried upgrading the skills and wanted to see what if I tried to pass a certain quest having this or that talent. So, overall if counting the replays, the game will take good 60 hours approximately. If you like pirate themed RPGs, main heroes with a sense of humour and breaking the rules, this game is a good pick. Aye-aye, gamers!			",34,3,6,7,1,0,2

												           In my opinion, the first game is better than this one. But Risen 2 is also a very good game for those who, like me, love a challenge. It's not a boring RPG, like, you arent going to face repetitive missions. You have to explore, search for information, negociate, and so on.            And also, the game is pretty well-made. The voice actors are good and the game is very immersive.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If they improved the first Risen's gameplay, plopped it in a gameworld that mattered ie. Gothic 2/Baldur's Gate, This could have potentially been a masterpiece.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had a good time playing this nice adventure game. Good graphics, good voiceovers and music, nice story and  enough side quests to keep me busy for about 150 hours.  And a good sense of humor as well! Of course it is not perfect, Everyone uses the same handull of gestures, the fighting is very simple. Actually I liked that. I did not play this game as a fight game, but as to follow a fun and nice story.  For me the game succeeded very well at that. Of course there is a lot of fighting, but no one is really hard to beat. I did not even invest in learning fighting skills. About investing...it is very hard to make gold, so be very carefull on what choises you make when spending money. A bit too hard even! I did get used to it, just not expecting to be able to really buy anything or learn a lot of skills. Just learned to get by with what i got. Stealing and lockpicking is a great way to get cash. I would advice to  invest in thievery, rather then fighting because of the reason mentionned earlier. Ow and you can become a voodoo pirate. I did not look into that a lot myself, but you can control other people's minds, which i think is cool.All and all...a great game to pick up on sale, because it is a bit old (2012) I would not pay full price on it.

												i have seen many reviews for this game, both positive and negative.as someone whose played most rpg games available i can fairly say this is one of the most engaging action rpg games you can play.most comments i see are ''combat is difficult and unbalanced'' or ''bad narrative''.well those in the former category are children or casual gamers.(sure beasts or wild animals are harder and like most gothic/risen games cant be blocked, because thats realistic)different characyters or mobs require different tactics thats part of the fun.and for the later.like all nordic/ piranah bytes games they have a rich story and lore wich starts from risen 1 and follows through to risen 3.i recomend this game highly if your like myself.as in action rpg fan, whome enjoys the likes of witcher, gothic, etc.I should also say that unlike risen 1 when you draw your sword your stance changes.this is one reason why people diont like it. i however love that fact that walking and fighting mechanics are very slightly differnt its more emersive.enjoy!

												Risen was great because it literally took the exact same storyline of Gothic. Gothic was better but Risen was still good.After the intense ending you continue the journey in Risen 2.So what should I say about Risen 2? Well, it was BORING!Seriously, you have such a great finale in episode 1 and think you are about to wreck the whole land and free it of its sworn enemies but no, sorry, all you do in this game is find a crew, gather some ""important"" (mostly useless) items and hunt down a random enemy that has nothing to do with the first game. I do not know what the developers think... Did anybody want a random sequel where you do random stuff that has almost nothing to do with the first part. It was the same with Darksiders 2, it is crap.And the worst aspect of this game was the final battle. You just mash the left mouse button and that's it. You could win this battle even with level 1 and a comrade by your side. Really bad sequel, pure letdown.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Risen 2: Dark Waters is a very glitchy and at times very tedious pirate RPG game. If you are honestly wanting to play an RPG, I would suggest you try the Witcher or Skyrim, as your time would be better spent with those games. In regards to Risen 2, I will say this: the combat is broken and frustrating for the most part, there are all manner of glitches which break any sort of immersion you have in the game, the story is incredibly bland and unexciting and most of the characters you meet are devoid of personality. In essence, the game is unpolished and truthfully not worth the time investment. It is sad, because the pirate setting seemed interesting, the voice acting is remarkably good at times, and even the music (though repetitive) is enjoyable. The idea of scourging for hidden treasures, finding legendary artifacts and the different ways to buid your character are great... but in the end never really amount to anything. If you enjoyed the first one, you will probably like or at least tolerate this game. But having so many incredible RPG jewels out there, Risen 2 just isn't worth the effort. Ultimately, you can enjoy this game and it does have its moments, but only if you keep your expectations low.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Nothing is more fun than random insakill traps that forces you to replay 30 minutes right? Or how about getting stunlocked by flying spears from all over the place when you can do nothing but roll around like a dumbass or flee? Do you like spending money on useless skills? This game has plenty! Exploring is fun! But not when half the stuff you explore cant even be accessed so you better remember all the locations youve been to and come back later because that is how the game is designed.At some rare moments i really enjoy this game but most of the time i absolutely hate it! Once you try the combat you will understand, its the most broken combat system ever made, look at how many games i have, NONE of them have worse combat than this game!

												I loved Risen so at first I was a bit disappointed due to the differences between Risen and Risen 2: Dark Waters.  But Risen 2 has grown on me and I'm really enjoying it.  The adverture and quests are super fun after the first few hours.Changes I didn't like:Graphics - I really liked the basic graphics from Risen.New skill development system.Choices don’t have as reaching consequences.Less creatures? (I've only just completed the second island you visit though)Less loot.Less puzzles.The tombs I’ve came across are tiny.Combat: I like that combat is more difficult when facing more dangerous animals (unless you use a gun) but I feel combat with other people is too easy now.  It's a hit and miss.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A heavily underestimated game.A lot of people became very negative about the game due to the early difficulty.If you're new to games like Gothic or Risen, do yourself a favor... start on easy and use the console to give you a couple of gold coins at the start.No more than that!With the gold get you a couple of health and combat skills early on and then learn the fighting system and take your time on the first island. Explore, kill, talk to everyone.At your ease.Also you can dodge by double clicking a specific direction. A lot of people don't realize this. USE THE DODGE! The game is very good and the fighting system once you unlock some skills is far better than people realize.Go for it! Well worth it at a discounted price.			",120,15,0,58,19,0,50

												If you are coming from Risen 1 this game will be shocking because of the VAST amount of changes to the way the game works and even the game setting or tone.If you can get over that, there is a well made, piratey swashbuckler-esc story to be had.The companions are useful, the fighting system indepth and the magic is fairly useful.

												One of most enjoyable European RPG I've ever playedRisen 2 is a game for those who prefer Fun time and entertainment over overall product quality.Although the first hour of the game might send you off, and if you can forgive its combat system, you will have really an amazing game filled with tons of sidequests, secrets to find, treasures to dig, legendary items to collect and monsters to fight.And the running animation sometimes is painful to the eye, lolThere also the dialogs, which i found sometimes hilarious. The characters are really interesting, and the whole tone and feel is so ""Adventurous"" and really build up.You also get a beautiful environment scenery. The Graphics are great, the islands, the weather, beaches, oceans and textures are all ""eye-candy""If you haven't already played Risen 1, i encourage you to play the game first then continue with this.""Sail Away, Cap'n""8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Average game. No more, no less! Nice graphics when looking in distance and in some situations... but absolutely no ""polish"" work by the devlopers (when the character ""climbs"" something, half the time it ""disappear"" in the texture). Bad voice acting and an average story (not very original plot). Really, really annoying fighting system! In the game beginning at normal difficulty it was very difficult to kill an opponent... to the end, everyone, also the bosses are too easy (due to the skill learned by the character)! Nice places and islands... but without things to do (just search treasures in 90% of the cases).The game could be a great game if the developers just spent 6 months more on it.... they released a average game for 25 hours of average game play (with launch ""DLC"").

Product received for free
												With an expanded setting, a fresh story and characters as well as an all-new technical foundation, Risen 2 expands on the success of this popular RPG franchise. Set several years after the end of Risen, the game drops players into a cataclysmic world where raging titans have devastated the planet and pushed humanity to the brink of existence. Subsequently, monstrous creatures have risen from the watery depths of the sea and their attacks have brought all seafaring to a grinding halt. The hero, now a member of the Inquisition, is sent out to find out how to stop the chaos caused by these creatures from the deep. His quest begins with rumors that the pirates who frequent the southern islands are the only ones who know a way to get rid of the creatures once and for all and end their reign of terror.With an all-new pirate-based theme, Risen 2: Dark Waters aims to combine the most loved classic RPG gameplay mechanics of the original Risen with a fresh theme and setting on a huge variety of themed island locales. Risen 2: Dark Waters maintains the most immersive features of the original Risen, with multiple approaches to every challenge allowing players to shape the game world based on their own decisions. These choices will serve to unlock new paths, features and additional skills for the character.			",218,63,8,25,14,3,18

Posted: September 8, 2016
												A complete turnaround from Risen 1, and I mean that quite literally. The first half of Risen 1 was pretty good, and the second half was obnoxious tedium. In Risen 2, the first half is obnoxious tedium, and the second half is pretty good.I can certainly understand how that might be a turnoff for many, and I can hardly blame them. Risen 2 doesn't get off to a great start, spending the first half of the game locked into a fairly linear storyline that doesn't hand out nearly enough gold or experience to become even remotely competent at anything, which forced me to pause the story a few times to wander around the jungle looking for loot and wildlife to kill, which was difficult considering that while the maps are extremely detailed to the point where I could almost always find a few nooks and crannies I hadn't noticed before, for most of the game nothing respawns so new sources of experience become increasingly hard to come by. Plus for this section of the game, your leveling path is completely restricted to whatever trainers are on hand, which made me wonder more than once why they even bothered with RPG mechanics if they clearly had their own idea as to how I was supposed to be building my character.However, once you reach what I think was about the halfway point (or at least it felt that way, might've just been the first act), you're finally given control of your own ship and can explore the various islands with pretty much total freedom, at which point the game really opens up. It becomes much easier to find the relevant skill tutors, monsters begin respawning (in small ammounts) when you travel between islands, the pacing overall just becomes better, and by then you've started to get the skills needed to not make the combat completely unbearable.And yes, the combat sucks. It's a notable improvement over Risen 1, where I turned on God Mode two-thirds of the way in because the game had devolved into a monotonous dungeon crawl at that point and the combat was clunky as hell and was deeply in love with stunlocks. Risen 2 is still deeply in love with stunlocks, but the combat is notably more responsive this time around so I made it about 90% of the way through before cheating, because ♥♥♥♥ed if I'm going to spend another dozen deaths trying to out-stunlock a giant spider with no pauses in its attack routine when the game arbitrarily decided my follower can't come with for this section.One final note I would make is that I'm glad Risen 3 has a new protagonist, because the Nameless Hero of the first two games is a complete turd of a human being. His every line of dialogue exhibits the personality of a man with absolutely no sense of respect, no principles, and no interest in the feelings of others beyond what can profit him in the short term. I'm pretty sure he's meant to be a blank slate for the player to project on, but if that's so the developers have a pretty low opinion of their audience. Sharing a headspace with this jerk for the 30+ hours it took to beat this game really made me want to see him thrown to the wolves so he could learn a bit of humility.(Oh, final-final note: about a third of the achievements in this game are bugged, don't waste your energy trying for 100% completion in that respect.)

												I bought this game and DLC on sale. Because i played Risen and read the bad reviews, i was hesitant to try it, but i was positively surprised. Imo, this game is better than Risen 1.I assumed my old save would be used together with my backstory, but this was not the case. I also seem to have lost an eye.In the beginning it was confusing, because the story tells i joined the inquisition, while i joined the bandits previously. If they had a story to back this up, i would have accepted it, but now they just assumed i chose to go with those arrogant p r i c k s.My review on Risen 1 would be a bit the same on this game.  Enemies are still overpowerd. While you start from scratch, enemies are fully skilled. People with muskets do overpowerd damage, wether it is ranged or just stabbing you when you're close. Upgrading skills isreally expensive. Barely any gear you can buy, which almost makes no difference, other than how you look. Quite disappointing. It is really the skills you invest in that makes the difference in how good you are at something.If there is an option to dress your char, i would like to take advantage of that, but the gear i liked did not have stats :( Unforunately, the ship cannot be used manually and/or upgraded, that would have been cool. You barely have any crewmembers.I like the fact you can now play with  a companion early in the game. Your compation knows every skill, so i often used them as a tank. Again, i liked the story.I would recommend the game contrary to Risen 1.A detailed story will be written later on.			",30,4,1,13,0,0,0

But I found it more entertaining, and that's all I ask of a game.Extra points for Patty being so gorgeous in Risen 2. She's ugly in the 1st, and, well... slu..tty in the 3rd. Didn't know they had breast enhancement technology back in the day... Blame it on a failed voodoo experiment?			",1021,927,54,235,156,12,212

												Just to start I love this game concept, and the 2nd and much needed game to the trilogy, but I have much hate for the shity way it was released...... And continues to be.... first i love the game in every aspect but these....1: Clunky as hell- Even with a beast PC I have had lag, when it rains, when I'm in shadows, even when I play for long times with out end. I couldn't walk around the Gnome town without lag, the rest of the island was fine.2: Combat- Lags SOOOOOOOO MUCH if you fight more than 3 opponets, and you companion will just watch the battle more than fight, throwing in the occasional hit or so... Makes them more of a rage then help. Glitch with Slane battle never fixed, if you don't follow him on the island of thieves the game never makes him a bad guy and once yu two fight it out it just turns into a slap fight where no one gets hurt. Had to use console commands to kill him. Final fight with Mara sucks, easy as hell, but great video after.3: No Cursor sensitivity- Like WTF ARE WE IN THE 90""s 4: Ending was very anti-climatic and set up nothing for another game, which there was and my review on that points out like the Devs just started a whole nother time line with no conection to the trilogy.I try so hard to love this one and it completes the story line (meaning it ENDS it with this game)  but WTF did anyone give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about bugs in this, or even FPS????? Still a ok game to buy (Cheaply) But Devs where you pushed to release this or what. Didn't you learn from Gothic 3?			",84,8,0,22,9,0,30

												For those who struggled to get into previous games by PB, Risen 2 has you covered. The game is far less challenging than the previous Risen or Gothic trilogy, but I still had a great deal of fun with this title. The combat initially seems wonky, but it grows on you. The controls are solid, the graphics hold up, the characters and plot are interesting, and there's a lot to explore. While the game is flawed, it is still quite enjoyable for the 30-40 hours you'll spend playing it.			",163,52,0,41,15,4,36

												+The combat is slightly less buggy than in Risen 1+Nice map-design- Combat still is sluggish, ""skills"" don't feel like skills but basic knowledge (like parrying) that is denied to you unless you farm a ♥♥♥♥ton of points in order to be able to perform a minimum of basic combat actions- Combat is a stunlock fest- Pistol combat doesn'e require aiming (like spells in Risen 1), but has a % hit chance making it an RNG roll- The story isn't paricularly interesting and contradicts that of Risen 1 in several aspects even though it claims to have the same hero- The game tries to force you in many different talent paths in order to make the limited customizeability feel meaningful. The result is that you will be annoyed quite a lot since you can't do the most basic actions unless you search the island and grind every last mob in order to gain the points.This game could have been good if the Dev team had decided to improve the flaws of Risen 1 combat instead of worsening them.It might have saved the game if they had tried to at least stay true to the original story... But no..Bought it for 1€ in a Humble Bundle. This game isn't worth much more.			",243,50,3,57,11,2,50

												Exactly the same gameplay mechanics as in previous game, but they added pirate and voodoo themes, which work very well in the world of Risen. There are so many pirate quests, cliches and gimmicks which make Risen 2 really stand out from all the other generic mediaval fantasy RPGs. NOt just one island this time, but several of them and you can travel around as much as you like once you secure yourself a pirate ship.			",203,56,9,27,27,2,24

												First I want to say that I LOVED Gothic 3 and really liked Risen but I cannot give Risen 2 a thumbs up as it is mediocre at best.The first reason being that the level of freedom seems to get cut in half with each new Gothic game (because this is essentially Gothic 5).  Gothic 3's level of freedom & choice was incredible and was the reason I dropped well over 160 hrs on it, Risen 2's only real choice is Voodoo or combat. Further to this is the ability to KILL.  Gothic 3 you could kill just about everyone, Risen 2 let's you kill NO ONE outside of normal enemies.  The best you can do in Risen 2 is knock them out BUT you CANNOT loot them and another NPC will quickly get them back on their feet then they will INSTANTLY be back at full health then go back to whatever they were doing with only a litttle ""offended"" message that shows, the consequence of which im yet to figure out. Next is the one choice you do get:  Voodoo or sword/guns, the former being fun but mostly useless, especially if you don't cheat.  Voodoo is pretty pathetic, it helps with a a handfull of story parts but for combat it's detrimental.  Sure you can possess enemies to fight eachother but that deprives you of precious Glory points and on NPCs it's a midly fun yet brief distraction at best.  Further to that it's almost entirely useless until it's leveled up which again, unless you cheat, won't be till later in the game.In a game where the combat is so unforgiving, especially ealry on, this choice essentially becomes: Swords/gun OR get your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you over and over.Overall the game felt rushed and, compared to Pirahna Bytes earlier offerings, terribly restricting.  The one bright spot was the gnome companion and his cute potty mouth.Pay no more than $5. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The drivers aren't the best, the fighting and the general story line is beyond repair. This has really spoiled it for me, because i bigged this game up as Risen (1) was beautifully planned out, and it is one of my favourites games so far, 1st buying it on the Xbox 360. I cannot give this game any compliments, except from your character looks pretty fresh. Well this is my opinion and others may disagree, but, if you want a Risen, get number 1, this is a ruined game/franchise for me.			",93,3,2,12,5,0,10

												This game is an RPG in a semi-open world. You are a member of the inquisition, going undercover with pirates. The game starts out alright, It has impressive graphics, the voice acting isn't bad, some nice background music and sounds and a storyline that is understood quickly, but has some depth as well.It is during the game that I found out the game mechanics have been poorly chosen and implemented. The game doesn't give you any information about the keys needed for certain actions. For example, a double tap on a movement key (WASD) will makes the character role. With the character progressing, you can learn certain combat tecniques, such as kicking. Again, the game forgets to learn you the keys to do so (hold defensive position with right mouse buttion and then press jump key). It doesn't let you practice these abilities, nor seem some of them broken, like parry.In the end, combat results in spamming the left mouse button, interrupted by healing yourself. After a few hours, this gets so frustating, you will rage quit. Too bad, the game mechanics are so bad, because the game does show potential.			",104,18,2,10,16,0,20

												sadly, this game was not as good as the first Risen. still good... but it has a lot of flaws. first of all, they kept main characters and plot, while moving from a sword-and-sorcery setting to one with guns and cannon, and moved to a carribean pirate aesthetic that really does not fit the feel of the previous game. second, the theme of the game is 'pirate', but a lot of that feels forced, like a checklist of tropes. there is no real 'choice', merely a rollercoaster. the only decision point worth noting is if you want to train voodoo or not. aside from that the game is also a bit buggy at times, and got stuck in the middle of the final bossfight. good overall, but it has its flaws. also, the skill system in this one is crap.

												Throwing in with a Piranha Bytes title, at the best of times, is a bit of a crap shoot.  Their games have been plagued from the start with programming issues and frustrating gameplay (like enemies that can just repeat-charge you to death), and yet the stories are consistently engaging, the worlds large and accessible, and the variety of progression rich.Risen improved SOMEWHAT on the poor combat model of the Gothic franchise and Risen 2 is even more polished.  Taken by itself, it is probably the most beautiful and professional game Piranha Bytes has produced to date (Risen 3 is due out soon) and it's genuinely fun to play.  Skills are extremely varied, from having your own parrot/monkey to do your bidding to various attacks to using guns, rifles and even voodoo; Risen 2 really throws a lot of gameplay options at you and surprisingly doesn't screw up any of them.  My biggest complaint was that if you choose rifles over voodoo there isn't really much in the way of skill progression available, but that's a minor issue.So to summarize, the game has pleasing visuals, solid gameplay and an interesting story that will take you to multiple islands and require much exploration and adventure to complete.  If you enjoyed Assassin's Creed: Black Flag for the setting you will likely enjoy this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Risen 2: Dark Waters is a great game of its own.The gameplay is different from other RPGs such as The Elder Scrolls, Not everyone may like it.The game can be really confusing sometimes, the quests, the map, pretty much everything but the game itself is really awesome, It's different from the other RPGs which is a plus.Just 2 things I do not like which are the freeroam and the ending.Do not except  The Elder Scrolls or even a Fallout game, it's open world but at the same time it's linear.You cannot continue after the ending, not even a new game plus.Those are 2 big flaws that are common in the games made by Piranha – Bytes.For some, it could be positive but for a gamer like me, they are both flaws.It's pretty much the same for every Gothic and Risen games, just that some have a better story, gameplay, items etc than the others.If it was truly open world with unlimited freeroam and we would be able to continue playing after the end, I would probably give it a 8.5/10 but since it is not the case I'm giving it a 7/10My favorite list:1. Gothic II2. Gothic3. Risen4. Gothic III5. Risen 2: Dark Water6. Arcania: Gothic 4 (I wouldn't consider this one as a Gothic game though)They are all good In my opinion, but some are more worth than the others, of course, they all have their good and bad.If only they would have a true freeroam and no ending.7/10			",972,203,71,193,128,3,223

												this is a review based on my first 30 hours of play. about 10 or so of that was a seperate playthrough, because i restarted in order to better allocate my xp and cash. i am far more impressed with this game than i thought i would be. so far, i have not experienced a single crash, or gamebreaking bug. performance on my above average pc (amd 8350 @ 4.81 ghz, 16 gb ram, amd 6970 oc'd) i experience some sub-30 fps at times with all settings maxed, but it remains playable at all times, and framerates are around or over 60 most of the time. and not one cdt or anything of the sort. if it does happen, i would most likely suspect a system bug, not the game code at this point. solid game.     the rpg elements are true rpg quality, with character progression direction being entirely up to the player, progression speed balanced about right (not too slow or too fast, both of which can ruin the overall game experience), and the progression mechanisms partially built right in to the environment. weapon availablilty depends on location and certain choices you make in the story. you can't just expect to max this character out over the course of the game, i very much doubt based on the arc so far, as well as the increasing requirements vs the limited ability to achieve those requirements.     there are numerous weapons, each attached to a skill. clothing is another high mark in this game. in all cases, the crap you start out with looks average at best, but as you gain fame and money, and reach new destinations, the clothing and weapons available get better and better, and have a high standard of quality when you see them on your character in the game.      every bit of dialogue is voice acted, and character models remain animated during voice interactions. alot of detail went in to building the environments as well, and each location, while sometimes similar to eachother to say the least, is a pleasant experience to look at.  the lockpicking minigame is the best execution of a lockpick minigame in any rpg i have played with such a mechanic. how many ♥♥♥♥ing lockpicks does a real lockpicker break, anyway lol. zero, that's how many. good choice on this, pirahna bites. i mean it.       what else can be said... collectibles are plentiful enough, shoplifting only earns you a fight instead of permanently ruining your relations with an entire town (here's looking at you bethesda), there are multiple ways to do many things in the game, the locations are large and plentiful... this is a top tier game in my book.      is it perfect? of course not. also, while plenty large enough for my tastes (and i do prefer a whole lot of world to explore), it is probably smaller in content than a bethesda masterpiece, but this game actually does alot of things better. think of it as... more focused. and it is still huge. you can't train a little monkey to steal for you in skyrim, or throw a parrot at your enemies face, or salt in their eyes, or breathe fire with a bottle of rum. maybe with mods, but you see my point probably. alot of variety and creativity are present.      i will add these notes: i use an xbox one controller, i play on easy (i tried medium but it was just too hard to be fun for me, though i may bump it back up if it gets TOO easy), i play on a smallish monitor but the game looks great at this resolution,  i am impressed with this game, and heartily recommend it to any fan of pirates, rpg or even a not-bad action game. 8.8 out of 10.edit: after completing this game, im lowering my rating a bit. still a great game, but it was a little short, and a little rushed at the end. what seemed like half way turned out to be 3/4, leaving me a little disappointed. so 7.5/10 after completion. solid and worth playing.

												Grand fan de rpg je ne regrette pas mon achat de risen 2. J'ai trouvé le premier opus excellent celui-ci ne manque pas à la règle, les graphismes sont splendide rien à redire là-dessus, le gameplay fidèle au premier est toujours aussi jouissif on retrouve cette difficulté dans les combat même contre de simple animaux c'est vraiment bien. Les quêtes sont nombreuses même en secondaire, dont laquelle on à parfois l'occasion de se mettre à la recherche de trésors en utilisant une carte qu'on n'a acheté ou trouvé. Tout cela dans un univers de pirate ou le héros principal le devient pour la bonne cause. Un jeu à tout prix à tester que du bonheur, seul point noir le jeu est en vo sous titré fr mais on s'habitue vite.			",83,27,2,14,9,0,4

												Not A Worthy SequelIf you were a big fan of Risen and looking for more of the same with Risen 2 you're going to be disappointed. While there are plenty of locations to explore, treasure to find, NPCs to interact with and enemies to slay, the core gameplay mechanics revolving around combat have taken several steps backwards. Gone is the fluid and intuitive combat that Risen boasted, where a combination of player skill, character stats and gear met that allowed one to tackle the most dangerous enemies in the game from the start if they had the skill and timing to back it up. Melee combat was very much like Gothic 1/2 or Dark Souls 1 in that way. You also had magic and ranged weaponry which were both highly effective if one desired that approach.Risen 2 does away with skill-based melee combat, featuring stilted, often broken animations and combat reduced to you and your foe hacking away at one another until one dies with a token dodge thrown in here or there. Magic is gutted and beyond worthless, and ranged weapons (guns) are extremely powerful to the point of trivializing the entire game.That said, if you're willing to overlook the atrocious downgrade combat has taken and want to see how the story plays out, it's worth a playthrough; but keep your expectations low.Final Score - 6.5/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												sadly, this game was not as good as the first Risen. still good... but it has a lot of flaws. first of all, they kept main characters and plot, while moving from a sword-and-sorcery setting to one with guns and cannon, and moved to a carribean pirate aesthetic that really does not fit the feel of the previous game. second, the theme of the game is 'pirate', but a lot of that feels forced, like a checklist of tropes. there is no real 'choice', merely a rollercoaster. the only decision point worth noting is if you want to train voodoo or not. aside from that the game is also a bit buggy at times, and got stuck in the middle of the final bossfight. good overall, but it has its flaws. also, the skill system in this one is crap.

												Throwing in with a Piranha Bytes title, at the best of times, is a bit of a crap shoot.  Their games have been plagued from the start with programming issues and frustrating gameplay (like enemies that can just repeat-charge you to death), and yet the stories are consistently engaging, the worlds large and accessible, and the variety of progression rich.Risen improved SOMEWHAT on the poor combat model of the Gothic franchise and Risen 2 is even more polished.  Taken by itself, it is probably the most beautiful and professional game Piranha Bytes has produced to date (Risen 3 is due out soon) and it's genuinely fun to play.  Skills are extremely varied, from having your own parrot/monkey to do your bidding to various attacks to using guns, rifles and even voodoo; Risen 2 really throws a lot of gameplay options at you and surprisingly doesn't screw up any of them.  My biggest complaint was that if you choose rifles over voodoo there isn't really much in the way of skill progression available, but that's a minor issue.So to summarize, the game has pleasing visuals, solid gameplay and an interesting story that will take you to multiple islands and require much exploration and adventure to complete.  If you enjoyed Assassin's Creed: Black Flag for the setting you will likely enjoy this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Risen 2 is a really good game and it's an honorable sequel to Risen 1.The story is quite catchy, but it's nothing new. It continues some time after the events from Risen 1.But don't await some big answers to your questions after completing Risen 1.The fighting system is learnable, but prepare yourself for fighting with a temptation to smash your mouse from time to time (eyes on you sword fighting).And c'mon, you play as a pirate, arrr!

												Well worth the money. Runs perfomant and is fun to play. However at the beginning, it is a little rough until you get going / leveled up enough, however if you are more into the story, just choose easy difficulty (it's still difficult enough at the beginning). The DLCs are also good, and are integrated into the main game as sidequests, which you should take in early midgame to raise your leveling and cash.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had no expectations going in, and I ended up LOVING this game.  Not a lot of pirate themed games out there, and certainly not a lot of pirate RPG's.  You can learn voodoo and choose between the natives and the colonists.  You get to fight an ancient sea goddess.  Recruit crew members, and then take them with you when you're on land.  A little rough around the edges in some places, but I just found it charming.  There's a skill you can learn that lets your pet monkey steal things for you.  Guys.  Guys.  You can put points into ""Pet Monkey Theivery"".  That should be the whole review right there.  I think you can also get a parrot, but he's not as great as the monkey.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'll start with some gripes...I've searched far and wide for ways to make the game function more smoothly; I have 8GB of ram and a decent processor, but fiddling with the settings hasn't helped much. Aside from some annoying deaths near the beginning though, the cutscenes are fine, the atmosphere is beautiful, and the sound is, suprisingly enough, not disappoining, even though Kai Rosenkranz didn't return as composer.Some pluses! As stated earlier, the music is great, and keeps in the spirit of the first title despite a change of composers. I liked the environments near the beginning a lot more than those in the first game, particularly the blazing city backdropped against a nice, gloomy, rainy, dark little fort. The first thing I look for in a game on Steam, even before solid gameplay previews and managable system requirements, is solid localization. Russian and English voices and subtitles are nearly a requirement, and messing around in German and Polish is fun. This game has all of those, while a lot of popular titles seem to skimp on this.I think this has been on sale at least twice for something absurd like 15-20$ for all three Risen titles with all DLC, so if it goes on sale again, buy the damned thing.

												A decent open world RPG. Pirates are a nice change of pace from other themes. A little bit shorter than the first Risen. There are actually very few choices to make in the game. Mostly everything happens the same way no matter what you choose to respond with. The game is pretty much saturated with treasure chests which increases the yawn factor. The combat is a little cheap and unfair at times, both in favor and against of the player.Overall pretty good though.			",49,6,1,13,3,0,4

												Now let me say this first; everyone has there own personal opinion, some people like things that others don't, and this is one of them.now that I got that out, let's get to the review. Risen 2: Dark waters is not the best RPG out there, but it's not the worst. I originally thought the game was crap because of what I heard from reviewers. But when I tryed out the demo I was suprised. the bad game mechanics I heard of seamed normal to me, they were like every other RPG game i've played before, and the fact that you pay gold to learn a new skill, was like when you pay gold to upgrade a skill in skyrim. the animations are not the best, but I don't mind because they make me laugh. the story was enjoyable, personaly I got sucked into it. the character models are the same from time to time but I think thats funny; just meeting someone in one island and sailing over to a diffrent one, and finding that person again on the island just with diffrent clothes and maybe a diffrent actor. and in the game you can use voodoo magic, and at times I just feel like a god seeing people kill each other, or scared of me because I used voodoo on one of them. But that dose'nt mean this game is the greatest of all time, there are things I dont like. One of the things I had a problem with was the fact that you could'nt sail your ship like in assassins creed 4, I was hoping for that. But instead your ship is a fast travel to diffrent islands. as well as the fact I am not allowed to swim in the game made me a bit upset. and finally, the fact that I could'nt interact with the world like how you could in the first risen.but like I said it's not a bad game, there was just stuff they did'nt add that could have made it a great game, for everyone who loves rpgs like skyrim or witcher.  but like I said it's not badMy personal score would be7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alright, here goes (A few spoilers)...CONS:-This game REEKS of poor design choices. The combat is the clunkiest I've ever seen in any game ever (even worse than the original Risen which was also pretty awful).-The difficulty curve starts off as a brick wall that turns into a damn cliff once you get over it (as in, it's hard as balls at first, then it becomes laughably easy).-The first ""real"" boss at the Earth Temple is interesting but then every other boss in the game save for the second to last (which uses the EXACT same mechanics as the Earth Temple boss) is just standard swordfights.-There are exactly two characters that are even remotely memorable throughout the game, and they both either die after the first boss or are as useless as voodoo.-Oh, and Voodoo is useless except for the points where it's shoehorned into the plot and you have to learn it and use it from time to time.-Money is damn near impossible to come by early on, and any time you DO have money you have to throw it at a skill trainer to learn the basic freaking skill set for your desired weapon(s) because SOMEHOW the player character forgot literally -EVERYTHING between the first game and this one.-Speaking of... after a certain point money starts piling up all at once. During the first 3/4 of the game you're poor as dirt, and then during the last 1/4 of the game you've got a minimum of 10k gold unless you specifically buy EVERY skill, period.-What the hell were the developers doing switching from a fantasy RPG to a ♥♥♥♥ing Pirate RPG?-There's no real feeling of your character's growth - you just buy new gear and more skills every now and then when you can afford them. You don't get that feeling of ""Holy crap these enemies used to be so tough but now I'm oneshotting them! I'm so badass!"" it's more like, ""Ugh, these things again. It's a good thing I got this new sword so I can kick the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it slightly quicker.""-There are no stats. Your health is capped at 100 with no way of increasing it. You cannot increase your character's strength as a fighter, you can only increase your base ""Blade"" ability and then beyond that buy more blade-related skills. You choose from slashing, piercing, and thrown weapons (sabre, rapier, and spear/throwing daggers, respectively), and pistols, muskets, and shotguns.Magic was completely removed in favor of Voodoo; which, yeah, it fits the whole ""Pirates of the Carribbean"" thing they've got going here, but it's still pretty dumb - especially how they wrote it off as ""The Inquisition (who, by the way, you joined up with between games regardless of which faction you sided with in the first game) banished all mages because they didn't stop the Inquisition from ♥♥♥♥ing up in the first game.""PROS:The story and world are interesting.It's fairly lengthy. Not as long as the previous game, but not short as 90% of AAA titles out there.Some other things which I honestly can't describe (see below).Now, all that being said I actually have to recommend this game, just not at full price. Wait 'til it's on sale, or better yet wait 'til the collection is on sale and you can get the first and second game for just shy of $10 like I did. I don't know what it is about this game and its predecessor, but the things they do right they do EXTREMELY right; it's just that the things they do wrong they do really, really, REALLY wrong, so it averages out into a decently albeit mediocre game....seriously though who the hell changes themes like that? That'd be like if the next Elder Scrolls game was about pirates, or if the next CoD was about Vietnam war protests, or if Half Life 3 ended up being a third person fantasy RPG like the first Risen.

												If I had one complaint for Risen 2 is that it's a bad Pirhana Byte game. I'm not someone who complains about a game being too casualized or too easy, but I can't ignore how many ways Risen 2 is a step back from Risen 1.That being said, I can still admire Risen 2 as a good game. Maybe someone who doesn't like the style of Gothic 1/2 and Risen 1 would still enjoy the game. The power of the game's theme carries it far, and if you want a light-hearted, challenging pirate game then Risen 2 is a great choice.(Just don't expect ship-battles.)If you have played Risen 1, you MUST play this game on Hard mode (even if you played the first game on Easy, like myself). Even at that setting you'll probably get by with far fewer deaths than the first game.If you haven't played Risen 1, I wouldn't recommend Risen 2 as an entry into the Gothic games. It's an accessible title for newcommers, yes, but the game doesn't have that freeform sense of discovery, replayability and challenge which makes PB games what they are known for. It wouldn't prepare you to play the other games.Arr Role To Play the Game (ARPG)If Risen 1 was centered on the mage role with Rune Magic, then Risen 2 is focused on a Thief/Pirate character. The difference is R1 allowed you to be more liberal with your playstyle and offered you multiple paths to make you curious to play the game again. R2 feels tailored to a specific playthrough.Swords, Guns and Thievery are what you will want to specialize in to get the most out of the game. Voodoo is far too strict/limiting to use in the main game and you'd be better off not crafting items of any kind and be better off looting what you can find. Alchemy, Distillery, Smithing and animal trading are useless fluff for immersion. Even if you don't care of replaying the same playstyle over again, then you'll find little to offer a second playthrough. There is a fork in the road to make the game feel like it's made for two runs. In reality, however, it's all a ruse. For one, if you're someone like me, you'll side with what you think is the good/right faction. The benefit of R1 was that the Don's men and the Order had both positive and negative qualities, making it unable to say who were the good guys. In R2, the natives are obviously portrayed as the underdog with little to no faults. Second, the branching paths connect together sooner than they part. They only shape how you go through the scenario, which feels way too linear to make you feel like you're accomplishing anything. (For example, you can't just make voodoo dolls of anyone to figure out how to solve a problem.)My recommendation is to make a Pirate-themed character, side with the natives for the Voodoo to change things up a little bit for the rest of the game--you don't even need to invest in the skill--and you'll get an enjoyable 25 to 30 hours of an experience. (Especially if you get the DLC.)Streamlined CombatUnlike other fans, I am actually okay with the new format for the control scheme. It plays similar enough to Risen 1 that it doesn't feel out of place--instead of side-stepping we have Witcher 2 style rolling and we also have Demons' Souls memory of your inputs. However, it's far from being perfect. The problem is actually that PB didn't make the controls simple enough, and the combat animations are too janky to read properly.On an X1 controller, you use X for attack (power-attack, riposte, etc.), Y for kick, jump and dodge, LT for parrying (the block) and RT for using a projectile weapon. When you hold down the LT button, you lock on to the nearest enemy and you can do a real parry and riposte (clicking X then Y simaltaneously). B and A are not used in combat. At all.This becomes a problem when you want to dodge rather than kick. Had they maped it to another button then you'd never have the problem of kicking by accident when the enemy circle-strafes your camera in the forward direction. And because you get a different control when holding LT for Y, then I don't see why they didn't do the Assassin's Creed layout of mapping buttons over one another. Switching them out with the LT.If that's too technical, the problem is they mapped way too many actions to one button when they have a better alternative, overlaying the buttons with a way to switch between them. It causes problems because some actions are based on where you are moving and how the camera moves. Another change I would suggest is implementing a Dark Souls stamina meter. It would counter-act spaming the dodge-roll button or make your attacks carry more weight in every battle. That would be one innovation I'd like to see.Speaking of abusing missing frames, the other major problem with R2 are the animations. Some enemies are too inconsistent to know when to strike in order to counter their attack, so you're better off dodging than parrying. Also, the block, for example, will sometimes block some enemies but refuse to block other attacks (like the Warthog). It's not clear what is acceptable and what is not from the animations shown. You simply won't know until you try, which I don't think is all that great.Despite these problems, I think the combat is an improvement; it's simpler, which makes each encounter full of tension with every strike you make. So long as you get over that inconsistency curve.(Oh, and the boss fights still suck. Not surprised.)Is Less More or Is More Less?The biggest change from R1 to R2 is the exploration. Instead of being on one landmass with multiple entrances/exits and shaping how you traverse the island from the story's progression, you are exploring about 10 islands (with DLCs included) of a similar size.It's hard to tell whether every major island is bigger or smaller than R1's location because the enemy mobs are much less of a problem than Risen 1. That change is definitely something I like as I found Ch 2 to 4 tedious from the enemy mobs. As a result of the variety of the islands, and the non-linear manner of the game, the islands sometimes lack an identity. Only a few have major differences than being a tropical beach for colonization.But because you're always finding something new to explore you will want to continue playing. The game has some Legendary items to give you permanent stat boosts and secret crew members to accompany you to make the exploration worthwhile. The best thing to do when arriving on an island is to ignore the settlements and go wander on your own--you'll get a lot more done that way.The worst change in exploration, however, is how much they've neutered the sense of exploration. Climbing is no longer as free to the player as in R1; dungeon crawling isn't about spatial awareness to traps or secret pathways; and exploring the environment to shortcuts doesn't feel as rewarding as before.Some might argue that it's due to consoles--especially the unnecessary QTEs--but Risen 1 was on the 360, even in a crappy state they didn't implement these changes. So why they limited the game this way makes no sense.Something To Be Found Beneath the GrimeIf it seems like I'm bashing Risen 2 a lot more than prasing its improvements, that's because there is a gem of a game to be found underneath the rough edges. The lore continues on from Risen 1 in some interesting ways, the characters you come across are more memorable, and even the horrible voice-acting and writing continue to have an amusing charm.Instead of being a grim, hardcore Pirate RPG, we have a light-hearted, self-aware yet still challenging Pirate game that has a lot more to enjoy than to lament on its shortcomings. At some point you should consider playing this game for fun.			",327,84,2,55,9,2,27

												A Really nice RPG, with a really nice setting. The characters are a lot of fun to listen to, and some of the dialogue has had me in hysterics. Ive read some things about the combat being poor but in my opinion it isnt all that bad, its not great but its no worse than say Skyrims or The Witchers. I'm not that far into it, but so far its been very enjoyable. Lots of exploration of intresting environments, looting and lots of killing turkeys for chicken (yes im serious). One thing to note is that its hard to gain skills and level up your character, unlike in most modern RPGs where you level up and gain skills from doing things over time (like in Bethseda games) in this and Risen 1, skills cost gold and  'glory' (both of which you need a LOT of) to level up your attributes, talents and skills etc. So be prepared to sink a hell of lot of time in just building your character to be able to defeat harder foes.

												A lowly roleplaying game, maybe the worst of Gothic (1 to 3 *)  and Risen series. Adjusted graphics, poor sounds and effects. The plot is reiterative but dialogues are funny, the combat system is simple, but decent. The maps are few, small, and wasted, with many empty zones and little loot or hidden rewards for exploration. The quick clicking events of traps and attacks are excessively lethals. By its short duration only worth with high discount.Warning: Not working well on windows XP.*  Forsaken Gods its a mere downgrade of Gothic 3, and Arcania its so disgusting that not really part of the series.

												The plot may be weak but that was not the reason I stopped playing.The combat system is terrible. Why take a genuinely good one from the prequel and demolish it?The dialogues are cheesy at best, infantile at worst.The skill system is confusing at first and disappointing later. Magic is dumbed down to about three effects, some of which you have to recraft every time. The alternative would be firearms, where you press a button to automatically aim and roll a die whether you hit and subsequently wait for the cooldown to wear off.I really liked Risen 1, this one is pretty unbearable. The only Pro is that it looks nice.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I started Risen 2 straight after completing the original Risen, which I greatly enjoyed. First off I'd like to point out that Risen 2 has made some vast improvements in certain areas: the graphics, layout, fast travel and I haven’t got stuck in a jump animation once (Which was a regular occurrence in the original) Along with a range of other things.But despite all of the improvements that have been made, one thing lets this game down for me. The combat. In Risen 1, the combat was difficult, but once you got the hang of each type of enemy it was a difficult but rewarding system. Risen 2 handles human combat (player vs human AI) well and is a little reminiscent of Risen 1 (Maybe even a little better) But the animal combat (Player vs anything non-humanoid) is painful. There's no better way to describe it, you cannot block or interrupt animals attacks, you're forced to either dodge and bunny hop around like crazy or just burn through health items  simply to stay alive. I really would like to recommend this game, but it's just not enjoyable having to fight packs of wild boar while getting rammed repeatedly by whichever one you’re not currently dodging.I would suggest you try Risen 1, which has its own flaws, but I still found significantly more enjoyable than this.

												Итак, я продолжаю свой цикл обзоров на игры серии Risen. Обзор на Risen: http://steamcommunity.com/id/thgttg_marvin/recommended/40300Обзор на Risen 3: http://steamcommunity.com//id/thgttg_marvin/recommended/249230Risen 2: Dark Waters является почти прямым продолжением оригинала.Сюжет продолжает историю Безымянного Героя, который за неизвестное время успел отрастить волосы, бороду, потерять глаз и обзавестись харизмой. После событий первой части, в которой  Герой пленил Огненного Титана, человечество оказалось на грани существования. Целью Безымянного стал один из Лордов Титанов - Мара, которая, при помощи осьминого-подобного существа Кракена, потихоньку уничтожает корабли Инквизиции. Первой задачей ГГ становится проникновение в ряды пиратов, у которых есть оружие для борьбы с Марой. Помогает ему в этом Бэтти - бывшая владелица трактира на Фаранге и дочь капитана Стальная Борода, к которому и направляется наш герой. Мир игры очень сильно изменился. На замену Мечу, Луку и Щиту пришли Шпаги, Сабли и Пистолеты.  Такой резкий переход из одной эпохи в другую почти никак не объясняется... Первые 2-3 часа могут показаться очень скучными. Во первых это из-за того, что вас держат в рамках сюжета, который не позволит вам покинуть остров, пока вы не выполните все необходимые задания, а во вторых - из-за малого количества самих заданий... Однако после второй локации игра начинает расцветать.Игра заметно прибавила в масштабе. Вместо одного острова теперь целый Архипелаг, поделённый на островные и береговые локации. Между ними вы можете перемещаться совершенно свободно с помощью своего личного корабля. Плавать на нём, как в AC4: Black Flag, вам не дадут, но это на само деле не нужно, Risen - игра не про часовое стояние за штурвалом. В каждой локации вас всё также ждёт море квестов, которые стали ещё интереснее. В пример я могу привести квест, в котором нужно помочь кандидату стать вождём и сюжетный отрывок на острове Воров, в котором вам придётся встретить мирное поселение Карлов (я знаю, что в Risen 2 они называются своим оригинальным названием ""Гномы"", но ""Карлы"" мне привычнее...). Интерес к квестам прежде всего вызывает появившийся в игре Юмор, например в выше названном квесте с новым вождём, по заданию нужно будет вселиться в тело одного из кандидатов и ответить на вопросы Вождя. На вопрос ""Где тебя так долго не было?"" Герой отвечает ""Нужно было отлить сходить!"", что вызвало у Вождя недоумение.В геймплее игры произошли некоторые изменения. Из-за них игра стала заметно проще, чем должна быть, но это не критично. Изменения коснулись прежде всего Ролевой и Боевой систем. В ролевой системе теперь не нужно качать Очки Обучения с каждым новым уровнем. За выполнение квестов и убийство различной мерзости вам начисляют Очки Славы, которые вы вольны потратить на любую из 5 веток развития: Холодное оружие, Огнестрел, Выносливость (прокачка здоровья), Ловкость (воровство и красноречие) и Вуду - новый вид магии, который пришёл на замену Кристальной магии из первой игры (по сюжету, после Фаранги кристальная магия стала ""вне закона""). Учителя тут также остались но теперь их задачей стало обучение различным ""особым"" навыкам. Ещё была улучшена система взлома и в не самую лучшую сторону изменена система торговли.В боевой системе появилась возможность использовать пистолеты или какой-либо из ""грязных приёмов"". Комбинации ударов сократили, теперь большинство битв проходятся простым ""закликиванием"" врагов, в то время как в первой игре нужно было постоянно использовать различные удары, чтобы убить врага. Автонаведение стало вести себя более адекватно, что меня искренне порадовало.Ещё из плюсов хотел бы отметить отличную постановку сюжетных сцен, чего только стоят сцены битвы с Титаном Земли и Кракеном, а так же  гибель Стальной Бороды и его последующее появление на острове Мертвецов.Из минусов же во первых хочется отметить отвратительный подход локализаторов к проекту. Описывать всю убогость перевода и озвучки я не буду, это надо увидеть и услышать самому...Из других: запуск игры на Восьмерке при помощи танцев с бубном, всё так же малое количество моделей персонажей, однотипные корабли, крохотные посёлки с максимум 10-ю жителями и уже отмеченную систему торговли.Итоговая Оценка - 8/10 если смотреть на игру со всеми её минусами, и 10/10 если просто наслаждаться всё так же отличным миром, хорошим сюжетом, свободой действий и персонажами, включая Главного Героя.

												As player who finished all Gothic and Risen games I have to say I loved the game. At first I did not liked it, and thought fighting system is bad, but as I was playing longer opposite showed to be true. I have found melee tactitcs almost for all enemy types. And only melee skill I learnt for most of the game was kick, I was playing as woodoo thief. When I read reviews that they say you have to spam mouse 1 clicking in melee I have to feel bad about them because spamming is viable only in realy rare ocassions. Agaisnt some enemies works blocking, agaisnt some not (there are even some enemies which you can't block, sadly one of them is enemy where they are trying to learn you blocking via tips :-) ). When blocking fails, try kicking or dodging. And so on. You have to use your brain, see enemies patterns and use them agaisnt them. And even when you don't like it, there is other way to enjoy the game. You can use firearms, by joing right faction. And this si lots of fun as well, and it is way easier. Another contributin to fighting in general are dirty tricks, you can throw sand/salt to enemy eyes, so you get free hit, if done succesfully. Later you can even use parrot to distract your enemies for longer periods of time. Woodoo gives you adventage in fight as well, if you choose woodoo instead of firearms. Of course as in most RPG game, luring out enemies one by one is the way to go most of the time. Another thing I liked about the game was, that  it made laught many, many times. Especially some mission fullfiled using woodoo were amazing. Another good thing is that you have companion of your choice availabe due to most of the game, which makes fighting easier as well. Story was  somehow predicitble, but still fun. I haven't encountered any bugs, except one minigame seemed to be as hard on normal as on hard (on easy it was easier), but maybe it was not bug. And some achievments does not unlock. One complain I will have about the game is that some skills seemed to be underused. For example great idea with trained monkey. Yes it pays for itself, but could be used way more during the game. Weapon smithing and gun smithing seemed to be pretty much useless, taking into account price of recepies and materials, with exception with use to forge legendary weapons. Another complain will be that there was no normal fighting teacher on the second island, or at least I did not  found him. As for the replaybility, you can play it once using woodoo, and once using fire arms.  Solution to some quest (mainly main story quest) will be different. And fighting is different as well. I wil reccomend RIsen 2 to all gothic fans, because as one of them I love it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The first Risen was phenomenal. This one started out just as great... then somewhere into the story I started questioning my life decisions (literally). Gone is the overall sense that you're working towards something big or about to stumble upon a huge discovery like in the first game. Gone is the continuity and sense of connection with the characters (I think the sudden transition from being a hero of an island to a being a nameless pirate was too much for me). Quests started feeling like a chore and I lost the sense of immersion I had with the first game. I'd like to think the Risen franchise ended with Risen 1.			",46,3,0,13,2,0,11

												A great RPG/Adventure game. The first 2/3 of the game I'd say I preferred the original, but towards the end I was all about #2 (I also haven't played Risen in a couple of years so my memory of it is a little foggy). I do like how Risen was more like Gothic overall, and Risen is definitely more challening than #2.. There were times it felt easy for this kind of game (I played it all the way through on Medium except I turned it on easy during the annoying target practice part). Risen 2 does have some pretty good graphics, but nothing mind blowing. There are also some graphical glitches from time to time, but nothing major. It doesn't run as smooth as the first Risen either. I also do prefer the combat in Risen, but after unlocking a ton of skills the gameplay in Risen 2 does get better and better as you go. The story also gets better the further it got along, but I also think that Risen and the Gothic games I played are the same in that way.  Well, in the Risen and Gothic games everything just seems to get better and better. They're all really fun games that put a big emphasis on exploring. Exploration is the main ingredient, and Risen 2 gives you lots of area to explore. It's not a huge game, but it is big. The soundtrack is pretty solid, too. The voice acting is good most of the time. Some of the dialogue is fun. Most of it is kind of what you'd expect in a RPG game like this, but the pirate theme adds some rough dialogue that can be amusing. When the game was all said and done I felt I had enough, but I really enjoyed my time with Risen 2. It's an underrated game, for sure. 8/10			",470,56,26,78,32,3,77

												It had some potential, but in my opinion it was wasted. There are some things that smell cheap and whole game doesn't have any element that would make some cause for player to spend more time on making progress. I played it right after Risen (which had many flaws, but it was ok overall and had that Gothic 'feel'). In Risen 2 I was waiting for game to catch me with its atmosphere and plot, but 16 hours is long enough for that. After that time I had no more will to wait for this game to give me some expected amount of fun.			",160,25,24,17,8,1,20

												I'm a fan of pirate scenarios and naval combat.  Unfortunately, despite carrying that theme, Risen 2 is stylized and plays like an Elder Scrolls Lite title, but without the support of the absurdity of ES modding communities to provide and/or refine all the needed elements.The basis of the game is ""Yay Pirates"" combat, which while it can occassionally be entertaining, is often nothing more than frustrating due to the mechanics.  Melee combat has two modes: attack and die.  If you block on a melee character, you're awful and need to reevaluate your life choices.  Blocking is purely useful to ranged characters, because on melee, blocking an enemy attack staggerlocks you, which causes you to delay before being able to counterattack, allowing the enemy to hit you again to interrupt your counterattack, or to blockbreak you.  You can tumble away though, allowing it to be viable to ranged combat.  The problem with ranged combat though is the limited resource of bullets.  Bullets are fairly rare, and must be conserved for boss battles and duels, because entering into melee combat in those situations is suicidal (mostly due to bugs: bosses can't be staggerlocked, you can, so you lose in a melee slugfest), but going ranged trivializes these encounters.  Easiest example?  The very first ""challenge"" duel in the tutorial area: if you melee him, he outdamages you, staggerlocks you and you lose.  That fight is designed for you to lose, give up and come back later when you're on his level (he hits ~4x as hard as you do at low levels).  But if you block, tumble back and hit him with a pistol shot, then kite until he catches you, rinse and repeat?  You can complete the fight without getting hit.The skill trees, while entertaining in theory, are plagued by a very clear ""Best path"", due to the alternatives not being viable. For example, pursuing the Monkey skill requires you to forgo combat specs (making the game harder), but the Monkey is awful, so there's no reason to suffer through a path with no benefits for the first half of the game, when the big payoff is a complete letdown.The game also lacks naval combat, so it's not truly a Pirate game.

												Unimaginative and tiresome RPG that has you running back and forth in the traditional style, doing chores for unimportant people in an effort to build up enough experience points to buy your way out of the opening scenario, which sucks.  You'll end up having to play the opening chapter several times just to avoid making a few easy mistakes which prevent you from getting past a bottleneck, thus fencing off the rest of the game from you.  Unless you can do enough great deeds to convince the pirate captain to take you with him, you might as well just give up, and it really does all hinge around that.  Tip: don't introduce yourtself to the pirate captain until you have finished all the quests in chapter one, or you will lose the use of his daughter as a co-fighter.  Or just blast your way through and learn this for yourself and have to play the first chapter several times over to get it right.  It's just too dull to bear repeat plays.More bottlenecks await, they've chosen that path for this second instalment.  I find myself pecking at this game from time to time as slight enthusiasm returns.  There's a mild humour, but nothing you'd miss if it wasn't there.  Some bugs too, preventing you from completing a couple of quests at least.  Voodoo pirates might make slick viewing in family adventure films (a la Walt Disney) but in games like this, where people play in their own private world, they just don't roll like they ought to.

												I tried to stick with this game but I really just can't. Risen 2 had a lot of potential with the pirate theme but ended up tripping all over itself trying to tie everything in together. the controls are the biggest issue here. They're the worst RPG controls I've ever experienced. Your character moves as if he is locked on a grid and he reacts poorly to the keys most of the time (maybe its just me, I can be wrong here).The combat was disappointing, it had the premise of being a tactical swordplay type of game but ultimately timing is pointless when the enemies have unblockable attacks and are faster than you. What fun is an RPG game if you don't look forward to fighting? That means a good chunk of the game is already unenjoyable and lost due to this poorly designed system. Levelling up is a chore, thousands of gold and glory are required and you're barely rewarded for taking the difficult quests. The characters are flat along with the disappointing story. the loot is barely worth the time with the lack of variety. The graphics are quite outdated and tax low end computers badly despite the quality of the graphics (my low end machine barely gets 30fps with the bad graphics). The writing isn't that good as well, the humor can be funny but most of the time the jokes are shallow. The voice acting isn't exactly good either. Aside from the main characters the npcs sure sound half baked when they talk.I fear that the Risen franchise may be in too deep to redeem itself with failure after failure. 5/10. The game is painfully average and doesn't give any sense of accomplishment with its quests.			",111,21,0,20,7,2,22

												This game sucks. Even for a 2010 title, the game mechanics and overall story are found lacking. The only few things that make this game even qualify for the RPG genre are the functions of Lockpicking, Smithing, and that it is single player. The dialogue options are incredibly basic, the tutorial time totals around 1.5 hrs, and the lack of being able to kill any non-hostile NPC's devalues the game. Instead, you can knock out an NPC (such as the Worker, who is unarmed) and they will crouch for about a minute before getting right back up. Similarly, when you try to assault the town guards, they quickly defeat you and you get back up, in additon to losing 50 'Honor' points. These aspects make the game feel very restrictive.The one decent thing about Risen 2 is its art and graphic design, which mostly applies to specific objects like the first ship you sail on. In terms of facial design and resolution, both are low.To be completely honest, I only ever finally installed it just to get the Steam Trading Cards it has.Edit: I've now beat the game, and still stand by everything I said three years ago. This is a low quality game- I now truly know that.			",125,25,0,17,15,0,8

												Another Piranha game - another GEM!In the last years I´ve found first Gothic III and since then the Risen 1+2.The gamestyle i simular - and I have found me spending around 200 hours in Gothic 3 (luckily my stay in G3 was helped by the 1 gb fanupdate - so it was brilliant out of the updatebox) and 100 in Risen 1 and so far 25 in Risen 2. And I have enjoyed almost every second of it.There is a lot of complaining about the fighting - but to me that is one of the really strong points of this game. It is NOT all about hammering the left mousebutton. It is however all about timing and keeping the precise distance (with kicking or dodging) that suits your fighting style and weapon.

												A true pirate RPG to make assassins creed 4 shiver in its timbers.  No npcs are too sacrosanct to assault.  Some will fall easily and give spoils, others will knock you out and respond accordingly.The fighting require patience and timing.  The four choices Block/parry, main attack, secondary attack (musket or coconut), and kick make for a nicely animated contest of rock paper scissors.  This game is superbly voice acted with hours of spoken dialog.Also exploration and reexploartion are big factors once with world map opens up (after the first main story arc) and you can fast travel to islands both familiar and new.This game is a masterpiece 9.5/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Risen 2 is a fun game, but it has some faults. It is similar to gothic and some old rpg, which give it added nostalgia value. You may find the combat system lacking, and yes it's not very good, but again it seemed old timey and likable to me. The plot if fun, but again not fanstastic. The whole game is a nice gaming experienceThe main problems are bugs, and random crashes the game suffers from. They seem more common on the steam platform for some reason, go figure.Secondly, the achievments are broken. Badly, and a lot of them. For example to get many badges you'll need to complete objectives in one go e.g. kill 2000 monsters WITHOUT SHUTTING OFF THE GAME. Obviously this is a big problem, and the worst achievment fiasco on steam i have seen since Darksiders 1.All in all, if you have nostalgia for the old times and patience for some sluncky game mechanics and designs and every now and then a glitch or crash, then get the game, it really can be fun if you let it.

												As a huge fan of the Gothic series I was reasonably excited for when the first Risen game was announced. Although it was mostly just a copy of Gothic 2 and its gameplay systems I still very much enjoyed it. Risen 2 tries to innovate on that formula. And I am thankful for that, since it was getting a bit stale towards the end of the first game.Risen 2 is a bit of hard game to get into, even for a fan of the developer. You really need to put a few hours into the game to get it going, as it has a very slow start. I'd say that'd be once you're past the first island as a pirate (yes the game has multiple islands which you can sail to anytime you want once you've discovered them and once you get yourself a ship), but it does take a good 4-5 hours to get through that.The game's biggest problem is the combat system, it is just badly designed, while the previous Risen/Gothic games had no great combat systems either, they had a lot of different ways you could approach it. In Risen 2 you are much more limited for most of the game. You can use swords, muskets or voodoo to vanquish your enemies, however you only get access to the the latter two much later in the game and they are painfully underdeveloped. As a result you will mostly just try and melee your way out of everything, and the melee system is quite bad.Piranha Bytes did a fine job with world building in this game, and they made sure there are interesting quests here also. And once you're past the initial slog, the game just keeps getting better. And at a fine length of about 20-25 hours, you will most certainly leave satisfied if you can manage to get there.7½ / 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I would definetely reccomend Risen 2 Dark Waters. If you like playing role playing games (Skyrim, the witcher etc) like me, this is a must have. You have absolute freedom in this game, there are many islands and locations to explore and there are a lot of side-quests and other fun stuff to do. The main story focusses on pirates, but there are a lot of things going on around it. You can recruit people for your ship, buy a monkey etc. The graphics are also stunning, even though at first i had to get used to the slightly different style of the graphics, i now absolutely love it. The detail in the towns and buildings is just incredible. You can play this game hours and hours without having the feeling there is nothing to do, it's incredible!There are however also some downsides which could have been better:1. The combat is basically the same through the whole game, it comes down to hitting, evading and hitting again with now and then an pistol move which has to be recharged. This can get very repetetive and boring after a while.2. There are some glitches in the game, it doesn't ruin the gaming experience but it can be annoying now and then.If you have any questions about Risen 2 or you don't know whether the money is worth it, i will gladly answer them or help you in any way!

No the game spanked you the whole time then taunted you when you failed cause you werent good enough.  I love the Risen series cause it makes me use my brain and critical thinking skills to actually interact with the game and still struggle to progess....which when you do get past a particularly hard enemy you feel acomplished.

												I'm quite impressed with this sequel to the highly enjoyable Risen.Not only have the graphics and controls been improved, but the feeling of freedom and exploration remain in tact. I'm not a huge fan of the pirate setting and quite honestly I prefered the more late medieval setting of the original, but it doesn't really hurt anything and provides an excuse to change up some of the mechanics like replacing crossbows with muskets and magic with voodoo.What I continue to like about this game and series is that if feels realistic overall, while providing fantasy elements in appropriate quantity that it still feels fantastic. Magic isn't blasted around like it's mundane, and strange creatures like giant crabs and ghouls will assault you between duals with vicious pirates or a hungry jaguar.The combat system still feels a bit rough, but it's an improvement over the last game. Musket blasts and sword slashes feel like they are hitting and making an impact, but there is still a level of random unavoidable damage from enemy attacks that can frustrate you during combat that feels a bit too fast at times and a bit too glitchy at other times. You will need to save often, because like the original Risen, you'll die from enemy encounters...a lot.Now of course the most important aspect of a RIsen game is the roleplaying element. So far, I'm happy to say that you'll be running errands, playing people against each other, and choosing factions and training paths as in the first Risen. Because it's a sequel and events were established in the first game, there at first appears to be less choice of your overall direction, but that fades away as the game continues. Allies are made and play a larger role in your adventures this time as well (although they are invincible and hiding behind them during encounters will almost feel like cheating). It does add the illusion of story driven set pieces in an otherwise extremely open-world type adventure.So far, my overall rating of Risen 2: Dark Waters♠♠♠♠♠Five aces of spades! If you want a beautifully crafted open world adventure on the high seas and tropical islands...Risen 2 will deliver!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Risen 2 follows the original Risen and Gothic 1&2 as entertaining and challenging 3rd person rpgs.  I enjoyed it about the same as Gothic 2 but with an ease of use not found in the Gothic games.  The controls have improved IMMENSELY since Gothic 1&2 and combat is more intriguing compared to Risen.  The story isn't the most engaging, but it is fun, including a few surprise moments.  The voice acting is good, but accompanying hand movements can be silly and repetitive.    I encountered some minor graphical glitches (swords not being in NPC's hands, for instance) but no major crashes.  The environmental graphics were quite a bit better than I expected.  The characters and their animations seem to be a slight step up from Risen.  The HUD is unobtrusive and allows for some sense of immersion.   Now, I am comparing it to Risen and Gothic 1&2 because of the setting, protaganist and system.  It is not an action RPG.  It is not Diablo, Skyrim  Choices can matter to how the quests resolve and the story progesses.  There is action and prompts for traps.  Combat isn't the easiest, either to use or to survive against the monsters until a few tricks are learned.  All in all, I recommend the game if you like RPGs or wish to try one.

												I had a blast with this game when I played it last Summer. I liked the story and the main character, had fun doing all the quests, and thought the visuals were adequate. I didn't expect it to be Risen 1 or Gothic or any other game. Combat was basic but I wasn't looking for a game that required me to master an intricate series of moves to win. I know other reviewers have mentione bugs and crashes but I was lucky enough to not experience any of those problems. If you like pirates and rpgs and have $4, give it a shot.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is really cool, a lot more polished and flattering than the first part, a very cool technology and beautiful graphics, not to mention the paramount story. Very well maintained climate Pirate Gothic 2 Night of the Raven. I highly recommend.			",127,16,4,19,5,0,23

												A good follow-up to the original.  It takes place a couple of years after Risen 1.  It was kinda wierd to go from a heavy medieval theme in Risen 1 to a heavy pirate theme in Risen 2, but I kind of liked it.My biggest problem in the first installment was the combat and the sticky focusing.  Sticky focus is gone, and it makes a HUGE difference in gameplay for PC users.  It's much easier to control and maneuver your character once you get used to it.  Dodge roll is your friend and incredibly powerful in it's defensive capability.  Once you get the timing and the angles you won't even bother with parry.At first I thought they pulled a 180 and made combat just as difficult as the first one but in a different way.  They took away a lot of the timed attacks and blocking that was notorious in Risen 1, and added what felt like a button mashing system for Risen 2.  Different style, same frustration.  Once you get a bit of Glory (XP) and put a few points into Blades you can get access to riposte and powerful riposte but I never bothered to build it past 6/10.  The real game changer was getting a bit of gear and access to muskets.  This made combat a LOT easier.  Dodge roll then musket shot, repeat.  There is also the addition of the companion system.  This allows you to take a companion with you for most of the game.  It's a huge help to have mobs focus on another npc or have a pack focus on you while they kill them off 1 by 1.  Overall I'd say this was an improvement in the combat system.Equipment is a lot better in the sense that, it felt you had a little bit of choice in what you could use, at least more than Risen 1.  I focused on Thief-skill, Musket, and Toughness items but you could just as easily build a more melee centric or voodoo based class.I feel that they improved the leveling and skill selection system as well.  Killing mobs, completing quests, etc gives you Glory.  Glory is spent to increase your main attributes: Blades, Firearms, Toughness, Cunning, and Voodoo.  Each of these Attributes affects 3 skills.  Talents that give you better abilities, both passive and active can be purchased with gold via trainers IF your main attribute is high enough.  So there's quite a bit of flexibility with character customization.Overall I really enjoyed this game.  More so than the original, but mainly because I didn't have to wait until the end of the game for combat to be easier and the addition of the companion system.  Definitely recommend this whether you enjoyed the first Risen or not.  It's a continuation of the first game but it can be played as a stand alone.			",158,30,0,56,15,0,16

												Risen 2 is a good RPG that's seriously underrated. It's true that the combat sucks and the prologue isn't interest enough for most people to invest more into the game, but the rest of the game is amazing and the combat will get better once you leveled up.Say whatever you want about this game, but PB knows how to make a good RPG. Maybe it's not as good as their other games but the game still has PB's unique traits: good music, lively world with rich dialogues, good atmosphere and immersive.			",175,29,1,29,9,0,6

												Risen 2 is a decent game. Little rough around the edges but a big improvement over Risen. Story and dialog are crap but I've come to expect that. Overall not too bad.BUT. It has ""on disk"" DLC. and for me its a killer. I HATE seeing a door to DLC. I really feel like I bought a partial game and it bugs me a lot. I am NOT overly sensitive to devs and pubs trying to make a buck, but in this case it bugs me deeply. For that, I can't recommend this game.			",132,5,4,20,18,0,31

The combat can be be a bit hard sometimes, especially versus multiple enemies. There is a problem with the achievements however, the Kleptomaniac achievemen, mr. Industrious achievement, Big game hunter achievement and Bane of the beasts achievement can't be unlocked. There is a problem and I definetely achieved some of these, but they didn't unlock. Apart from that it is a wonderful game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'll give it a 6 out of 10 I don't recommend it to anyone that has experience with RPG cause it's a classic one that brings nothing new and finish to be waste of time.It's cheap in term of technic for a AAA  (reachs this category by its price), fights are simple and for a pirate game don't expect naval battles nor even boat selling except ""fast travelling""...Some nice ideas like vaudoo but the overall lack of technic or novelty doesn't rise the game to the top.Then if you are a new player or not expecting a lot of RPGs you might find yourself a cool game and if not you can pass this one or keep it for a try.

												Overall, a fun game if you like pirates and action/RPGs and don't mind giving it a few hours to start before the fun really sets in.Pros:-Be a pirate! Drink rum! Swashbuckle! Dig for buried treasure!-Environments are of a good size and allow for exploration-Variety of enemies from insects to jaguars to undead. Also PIRATES-AI companions offer some enrichment for combat and have unique personalities-Some customization for your character by choosing skills to focus on-Good variety of weapons and skills including several types of blades and guns, or even throw coconuts!-Persuade, pickpocket, lockpick, or even voodoo your way out of sticky situations if you train these skillsCons:-Slow to get started-No customization of character name/class/appearance-Combat can be awkward with lots of repeatedly pressing attack button-Skills are all quite expensive to purchase/train in and don't appear to be well scaled to the rate your attributes increase-HUD lacking, no stamina bar or minimap visible-Poor quality AI - allies get lost, enemies care if you steal but forget you if you walk a short distance and return.

												great RPG i know a lot of people hate this game but i really enjoyed it its pirate setting is awesome theres now firearms and voodoo and no more magic and the story and soundtrack is wonderful the graphics in this game are stunning not as good as other game like in the witcher 2 but still good and just like all PB games the voice acting is very well done and later on in the game you can get a ship a start your own crew each of your crew members have thier own abilities now the game isnt all good and i can see why a lot of people hate this game like when you start you cant kill anything and you will have almost no money not til after a while of playtime til you can learn voodoo or how to fire a gun and the combat feels off like not til later on in the game you can learn how to do more then just wacking away with the left mouse and but later when you get stronger it makes the combat better but you always feel like there isnt much you can do you and you dont really run a ship your ship is just a way to get from island to island and its not like you can sail the seas and raid other ships and this game isnt as hardcore as past PB games so it dose lose some of the things the things that made risen and the first 3 gothic games stand out so i would recommend this game only if your a fan of PB and can look past problems and enjoy it for what it is			",142,14,1,23,6,1,19

												Risen 2: Dark Waters – the game from the German developers from Piranha Bytes. The protagonist of the first part of the series is already faced with the pirates on the island of Faranga. But now, freed Titans create storms, drown ships and sea settlements and claim the lives of hundreds of marine civilians. Here we come, the hero of Faranga, in order to save the day, and destroy the raging Mara the Titan. Our old friends will help us with this, such as the daughter of a famous pirate Captain Steel Beard, Patty.In the second part of the trilogy, the protagonist becomes a pirate, in order to enlist the support of the local filibusters and Captain Steel Beard. The plot, as it is stuck at Piranha Bytes, banal. We are looking for treasure using old maps, swim to the islands in search of adventure, drink rum in the port taverns, fire at bottles, general are living a normal life of the average pirate. From untypical for pirates, we are destroying sea monsters created by the Titans, travel to the realm of the dead and looking for artifacts to defeat the villain. The plot - not the main advantage of Risen and Gothic series, it is simple, does not stand out, but sometimes intriguing and exciting.Graphics became more beautiful, brighter. Beautiful tropical landscapes, ancient ruins and settlements look amazing, the graphics pleases the eye. The visual effects are better, more realistic. The monsters, characters and various wild animals looks wonderful with textures of high quality. In visual terms, it is the same Risen 1, only better. The only thing that looks bad, it's character animation, it is terrible as before.The role-playing system has changed. There is no more magic but voodoo witchcraft, but there are guns and pistols. Now, the main character can treat the characters and convince them, he can tame parrots and monkeys and use them to steal items. Now we have many different talents, abilities and skills, their numbers literally dazzled. It's very interesting to develop and put into practice.It is fashionable to make games easier for consumers. Risen 2: Dark Waters does not suffer the same fate. The game is very hard, the combat system is no exception, especially in the early stages of the game when we do not even know how to counterattack or use witchcraft and shoot straight with rifles and pistols. Money is not always enough: there is nothing to heal yourself, a weak weapon, nothing to pay for skills training and so on. It difficult to gain experience, and as result we cannot learn all skills in one walkthrough, it is necessary to distribute the experience points wisely, learning only what is necessary.Risen 2 has so much content to offer, so many side quests, worlds to explore, everything. I have put almost fifty hours into this game, doing all of the side quests, a good amount of grinding and of course the main story. It's very rare these days to find a game this good that gives you that amount of gameplay. As a result, we can say that the atmosphere of piracy transferred perfectly, as in visual terms and in terms of the atmosphere. The game is to play it. All will be happy, especially those who love the pirate theme. Yo-ho-ho!			",82,15,0,26,11,1,8

												Piranha Bytes sticks to the root with Risen 2. Just like Gothic and Risen it's a slow paced hardcore role-playing game.Personally I did not like the pirate setting and the story in this one compared to the original.

												How many mediocre games does developer need to make, in order for them being perceived as not cool anymore? Same as every other Piranha Bytes game, unless you've been to Irdorath, you'll find Risen 2 below average at best. And if you actually finished Gothic 1 and Gothic 2, odds are you'll be dissapointed.The answer is three.			",298,63,11,41,24,5,40

												The Risen 2 development team's discussions must have included lines such as these: ""It doesn't have to actually look like the player character is jumping, so long as he is moving through the air."" ""The player doesn't need to feel like they're controlling the combat - we'll just have them try to press buttons at enemies until they die."" - ""Explain the game mechanics to the player? Meh, Dark Souls doesn't do that, either."" There is one word that perfectly described Risen 2: ""curde"", as in ""crudely made"". So why am I actually recommending this game? Well, because it's crudeness is sort of a ""Mount & Blade""-like crudeness.Yes, Risen 2 is crude. But it's also charming and captivating. How captivating? Well, I was really pining to play Dark Souls again while playing Risen 2, put I decided to put it off. The dialogue in this game is well written, though not always well voice-acted. The characters are all you'd expect from a pirate game: drunks, thieves, ruffians and weirdos litter the various islands of its world. But its biggest asset is the sense of exploration that it gives the player. It always makes you curious for the next thing. I don't know how they did it, but ever since Gothic 1, Piranha Bytes has been able to make running around and picking up random stuff off the ground an intriguing passtime. But that is not all that Risen 2 is, of course. There are many interesting conversations to have, talents to learn, quests to undertake and enemies to slay, despite the abysmal combat system - seriously, it takes the guy like 2 seconds to execute the input! Could be that I'm playing with a controller, but it's just so much more fun.Get the game on a bargain and enjoy!			",58,20,0,16,12,0,18

												What happened to Risen? I recommended the first very highly as the ""Dark souls of RPGs"", but something along the way went missing in Risen 2. It's got the same unforgiving combat and rough-around-the-edges questing systems that I loved about the first, but a piece of the magic is gone. All the jungle areas were too similar, and too big. And I didn't encounter any areas that really interested me, teasing me to brave monsters above my pay grade in exchange for fabulous game breaking rewards. We fight monkeys and boars in this game. I had to remove it after a few hours. Maybe it gets better later on, but I just couldn't get through it. Disappointed.			",663,191,16,85,62,7,117

												I would recommend this game to people who have already played and enjoyed PB's previous games in the Gothic or Risen series. This is probably not a good place for newcomers to get introduced to the studio's unique style of RPGs.  Risen 2 could have been so much more. For every step forward from the excellent Risen, there are several steps back. Combat, while functional, is clunkier than it should be and plays like a low rent version of The Witcher 2's combat. Parts of the game seem unfinished—some of the skills, like the promising monkey training and intimidation skills, are poorly implemented into the game. Worse of all, the dialogue and character animations seem like they came out of a game from the 90s. So why the recommendation? For all its faults, Risen 2 still manages to capture what makes PB's games so enjoyable. Few developers craft such lush, believable worlds that are fun and rewarding to explore. While there are a ton of quests of varying quality, the game really shines when the player is just exploring new areas, with the danger of coming across enemies more powerful than you.  Unfortunately, technical issues still plague this game. Nvidia users are advised to uninstall any 3D Vision components, as it's been known to mess with framerates. Also, a simple ""Anti Warp"" mod is needed to fix the awful and emersion-breaking foliage warping problems.			",265,64,5,42,23,3,72

I really like this game, however I regret I bought it when comes out. I've paid 30+ € to discover I have to pay same amount money for 'Disc Locked Content', which were simply cutted out from the story.. There is no chance for it, might consider buying it with bundle for 1$ perhaps. Do not mind about some glitches in game, except camera work. Makes using gamepad during fights bit.. confusing. Definitely will buy next Risen, however I will wait for sale and get at last 80% of discount with all possible DLC included. May wait, have plenty of time. ",260,45,7,27,11,1,33

												It's somewhat to play, but very rough and un-polished. The combat is VERY bad, the skill/XP system is worse and seems mostly half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and not thought-out. The quests and the storyline are kind of domb, but not as dumb as literally every main character in the game. The characters have one-liners that they repeat to no end, and it gets annoying.I have to go back to the combat, because it's legendarily bad. It just queues your actions when another action is in progress,  and it's impossible to stop the queued actions. For example, you press attack three times, you cannot do ANYTHING until you've attacked three times. ANYTHING includes pausing the game, running away, using secondary attack, opening inventory etc. but not using items in your quickbar, which is a relief, because you need all that healing when you can't dodge any attacks.The skill system is the weirdest. You have ""Glory"" which is XP and used to increase your 4 base talents, which increase their 3 or so each sub-talents. The talents are useless if you don't know any skills, which you need GOLD to learn, by paying someone and also having the required talent (and prerequisite skill) levels. The XP amount needed to increase the talents is also half-assedly chosen, just multiply the talent level by 1000.The movement is hilarious, Jumping works like if you are put on an invisible conveyor belt that transports you 0.5 meter up and 1 meter forward.The thieving system is half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you need to learn two skils and then just keep increasing your thievery skill and you can open any lock, if you have a lockpick, that is. You can also pick pockets, but you do this by talking to someone, instead of sneaking up to them. And you can only pickpocket certain characters at certain times. Lockpicking is the least challenging in all the RPG games, you just move the mouse back and forth and it will open, you can't fail.You can dig for gold and treasure, the treasure appears as a literal red X on the spot  once you have the map. You need a shovel for digging treasure and a pickaxe for mining gold (there are very few randomly scattered gold veins). You can have many pickaxes and shovels and they are classified under consumables, but they never get consumed, like the lockpick. Seems like they were maybe planning to make them consumable? I don't know.One good thing is, that you can skip all dialogue sentences and it makes the horribly stretched-out dialogues more bearable.			",273,79,7,46,30,4,48

												I'm a huge fan of Risen, so although I expected a reasonable game, I really didn't expect to enjoy Risen 2 more than its predecessor.Both are third person adventures, both have solid stories that generate cause and effect with a beginning, middle and end.  In Risen 2 you play a pirate with a number of companions available who are actually useful.  I'm not a fan of using companions.  I play Skyrim without them unless forced by a quest.  In Risen 2, the fact your companions get stuck in and not stuck in your way is a bonus.Risen 2 is an exciting game.  With Patty, Captain Steelbeard's daughter from Risen, you journey across the sea to various islands, tracking down legendary weapons, digging up treasure and deciding which faction you want to side with.  You have plenty of choice regarding how you develop your character and teachers are to be found in every port.  I've focused on being a thief and just love the trained monkey.  NCPs talk to it, ask what its up to, does it want a drink - silly detail, but wonderfully immersive.  Parrots also feature and are fun as well as useful.General control of your character is straightforward but fights are another story.  Combat in Risen 2 has been slated for being poor but, like Dungeon Lords and Venetica, you need to use timing and avoidance to make the most of your abilities.  You also use both hands.  Your right has a sword, spear or voodoo doll, your left a pistol, coconut, knife, parrot, sand/salt.  Plus, you can kick an enemy.  The only two handed weapon I've found to date is a musket.  The Boss battles are hard, but enjoyable.  This isn't an easy game, the combat is difficult to master, but very satisfying once you have.  I've also noticed there is often more than one way to complete a quest.Yes, I did say a voodoo doll is a weapon.  Rather than using magic as we gamers generally understand and know it, Risen 2 has voodoo.  At times it's quite brilliant and has given me some of the biggest laughs I've had from a game for a long time.  There is a lot of humour present in the dialogue.  Combine this with taking someone over by waving a doll at them and..... well, I'll let you find out. The dialogue also contains a fair amount of cussing - but then you're amongst pirates.  Joking aside, this is not a game you would want your children listening to, the language is very adult.  But, if you enjoy action packed, third person RPGs, have a look at this one.  It's very enjoyable and I'm totally hooked. ",71,81,0,41,17,0,13

												This is a bad game.  I wanted to give it a thumbs up, but I can't justify doing that.  I had fun, but it took several hours of grinding to get to a point that I enjoyed it.The quests are mostly well done.  The maps are nice, too.The graphics are okay, not great.  However, even on the lowest settings, the game still runs slow on a modern machine that exceeds system requirements.  Getting your character to level up is a pain.  The economy is bad, and I grew tired of picking up junk off the jungle floor.  You have to spend huge amounts of gold that is hard to accumulate in order to buy skills, like the ability to pick locks, block, kick or use heavy attacks.  Loot every location, kill every foe in the game, and you're thousands of experience points and gold currency from being able to use the character to his full potential.  Your tutor for swordsmanship also stops being available to you late in the game, when you would be able to learn skills from him.  Due to the unresponsive controls and poor effort put into the combat system, it is next to impossible to dodge, parry or riposte.The Earth Temple (your first boss battle) is the climax of the game.  It doesn't last very long, and gets very dull after you beat down the extraordinarily tough minions.Eldric is the stupidest name you could give to the druid in the DLC.This game is a shameless knock-off of all the Pirates of the Carribean movies and disappoints.

They do not understand that this game is suppose to be hard and have a MetroidVania(sort of...) style of gameplay. The battle-system is a nightmare when you fight a group of enemies. However, I do agree with what people say about ''learning new skills in this game is too expensive''You should play Risen 2.

												I find Risen 2 as a highly underrated but great successor of Gothic 1 and 2 and Risen games (it's made by the same developers to those who do not know). In fact, I personaly like it much more than first Risen. It has many rough edges, there are visual glitches, few dialog errors (but no game breaking ones), combat is clunky and hard at the start, but that changes with more skills You learn yet it remains challenging. I liked that opponents had their weakneses which you can take advantage of (for example: you can turn giant crabs on their back with kicking). There are often 2 or more ways to solve a quest. I enjoyed being a thief again as I enjoyed it in good old Gothic: Night of the Raven. Atmosphere is great especially when there is a thunderstorm. Locations are smaller than in previous game, but they feel more... personal, detailed and thought trough and it's fun to just explore (not to mention that it's also rewarding). Story isn't that breath-taking, it's a classical ""have to save the world"" story, but I liked it, it goes within the footsteps of Gothic saga. Characters are deeper then in Risen 1 and I found a few memorable ones which is a huge improvement from the previous game, from which I don't remember a single character (except for Patty, which is also accompaniing you in Risen 2).Graphics are (at least for me) fine looking, sometimes even gorgeous (Storms, Sunrise, Dawn) and are not HW demanding as I could play it even on my old work notebook.I still didn't finish it after 25+ hours of gameplay, but so far I would give the game 8 out of 10. I can only recommend it for all the other RPG-positive players out there.			",145,46,4,17,8,0,10

												Risen 2 is more focused on pirates than the first game, and you actually become a pirate yourself to safe the world again fighting slightly more interesting creatures and meeting interesting folk, who you later end up forgetting about.Shifting to the more pirate kind of world, mages have been removed from the game with a mention somewhere in the dialogue as to why. Instead of mages we now have Voodoo witches, the natives living on some islands. The bows and crossbows have been removed and instead we have pistols, shotguns and muskets.The leveling up has been changed from how it was in the first game. You now earn Glory, which kind of represents your XP. Glory can be used on the character menu to upgrade your stats. There are still trainers who you need to pay to learn spesific skills like smithing or how to do a riposte. This was confusing to me at the beginning and it took a while before I figured that I can buy skills, but need specific stat level to do so.The graphics are rather good and modern looking, but sometimes there would be glitches where while walking towards a tree, you'd see its leaves becoming smaller as you got closer, until they were the right size. The menu screen has been changed so that you can easily access all the info you need from any selection you're looking at. This also makes the game look a bit clumsy at the beginning, if you start right away from the first game, since it is completely different.The game itself is much more bug free than its predecessor, but sometimes you'd encounter minor bugs that don't harm playability.Fights are still rather difficult and you'll be using quick save a lot. During my 20 or so gameplay hours I saved over 2200 times (Which was a tad too much than needed, but better save than sorry). This is also my biggest complain about the game. Using quick save creates a completely new save and doesn't overwrite the older one. This means that I had over 2200 save files at the end and the game started to load longer. Easily fixable by removing the older saves though.Overally a great game after you get used to the new mechanics, but a lot less fantasy like when compared to the first game. If you like pirate stuff and RPG's, then this is the game for you.			",353,107,20,62,44,6,70

												A very good and traditional Piranha Bytes game hampered by one major flaw: corridors. While splitting the world into islands makes sense for the setting half the islands feel like linear tunnels more than worlds to explore. Still, the solid RPGing around that makes this worth a play and the setting is perfectly realized. Musket combat is unique in the genre and solid throughout the game. A lot easier than the Gothic series but a little challenging at the start. Solid stuff for genre fans.			",261,55,5,34,7,1,37

												I'm sorry PB but I cant understand the need for the change of theme from Risen 1 to this game. I just dont feel that the Pirate theme was a good idea and as someone who loved Risen 1 I felt really letdown by this sudden change which I didnt feel was either wanted or required. Secondly I really dont like combat in this game and feel this was the area from the original they should have been focussing on improving rather than the theme, combat just feels clunky and the progression system means in the early game you will suffer but by late game its all a bit to easy. Suffice to say I didnt enjoy fighting which proves to be a significant issue. I also really didnt like how the magic is completely replaced by Voo Doo which doesnt feel like its properly balanced. Lastly I did notice some performance issues whilst playing this game.IMO Risen 2 and 3 are very average offerings and I would instead recommend playing the original Risen unless you really have a thing for cheesy pirates.

												I saw this game sitting in my steam list - no idea how I got it - and decided to give it a go.It seemed like an interesting pirate-style RPG, however when I started into the game I was given the intro of a very generic plot (which I won't spoil in case someone actually wants to try this for some reason).The game looks okay, not great by any means, until you leave the starting area that is. The pop-in is unbearable (at highest settings mind you). Walking 5 meters from a tree makes half of it's leaves dissapear, textures flicker in the distance, and lighting bug out _everywhere_.The gameplay is even worse, after completing the tutorial you're put out into the ""open"" world (which from the little I saw in my 20 minutes of trying to get the game to work was not very open at all).Here you will HAVE to do ""side"" fetch and work quests to get money to buy the items REQUIRED TO PROGRESS IN THE GAME, but the game does *NOT* tell you this, not only that, but *GIVES YOU THE OPTION TO DECLINE THE JOBS*.I successfully got stuck here because I didn't have enough money to continue and there were no NPCs I could talk to, or any dialogue options to bring back the possibility of getting money. It tells you ""Save often"" on the loading screen, this most be why.I came across numerous physics glitches, and the AI seems like they were copy/pasted from another game and not even slightly adapted. They would spin around in circles randomly, have trouble sitting in chairs (walk around them for a good minute and a half first) and have trouble attacking you as well.The combat is clunky and floaty at the same time, if you hit an enemy they slide back an unreal distance without even playing an animation, there is only 1 button to attack, no heavy attacks, no other types of attacks.You will spend most of the game pressing one button, and ignoring the ""blocking"" because it's literally useless.Along with that, the framerate, for a game that looks barely on-par at best rarely exceeds 45fps even in the starting area on an R9-270.

												Nice game if you enjoy being a pirate. However still this is just for the Gothic franchise fans. Lacks the enormous worlds, but makes it up by letting you travel between several islands. The gameplay is still as old as any of the Gothic games : you just keep hitting the mouse clicker until whatever you are fighting is dead. Magic (voodo) feels hard to use and not so powerful as it would suggest. The story is pretty forward and aims to eliminate the chaos created by the previous hudge world in other Gothic games.It's not a bad game, still I say this again : just for the Gothic fan-boys.

It reminds me of witcher and dragonage... actually it does feel lol alot like them but in the water... But the simple fact that its kinda clunky, reactive and with wierd response, makes me not wana continue.

												This review is based on the core game (no DLC), after the combat fix.Risen 2 received mixed reviews on release.  Reviewers complained that the combat was too difficult or tedious, that the game is exposition heavy, that the game is too linear at the start, and that the game should have a more earnest tone.Deadly Waters has classic Gothic-style combat.  At the beginning, you can attack and dodge.  Over the course of the game, as you gain experience and seek training, you learn additional moves (parry, riposte, shoot your gun, kick, throw sand in their eyes, etc.)  Each new mechanic you unlock makes you a better fighter, if you are skillful at deploying your new skill.  Every one of your character stats has an impact on combat, though swords/guns/toughness have the most obvious effect.  The game IS combat heavy.  Because raising skills costs increasing amounts of experience, it's obvious that having a base level in all skills is the most efficient way to have a capable character (e.g., raising voodoo from 4 to 5 would cost the same as raising all other skills from 1 to 2).  Characters who overspecialize may run into tough times.  The combat also rewards smart approaches, like luring dangerous enemies to allies or working with a partner to take down a particularly tough enemy (one of the hardest enemies in the game can be killed in the first island if you work with your partner, Patty).Lockpicking and pickpocketing are uniquely implemented.  If you meet a skill check, you can pickpocket someone you're talking to and you're treated to a little special dialogue.  I like that this kept me from pickpocketing the whole world (I'm looking at you, Fallout).  There are plenty of locked chests, opened by running a pick along a series of tumblers.  It's basically working out the combination of how to travel a line, but I appreciated a different look at lockpicking.  You'll either find it tedious or revel in your growing mastery of the minigame.This is a thing about Gothic and Risen.  You have to enjoy the mastery of your skills.  It's expensive to level a character and train them to gain a new ability - you have to want to use that ability, to make it pay off, to make it a part of your mastery of the game world.  The dialogue is sparse, sometimes amusing, and most of it can be skipped if you absolutely must.  Still, I don't understand how reviewers could complain about the quantity of exposition in this game - it's really very minimal, the bulk of your time is spent exploring and fighting wildlife.  It has nowhere near the amount of dialogue as Fallouts 1-3/NV, Oblivion, Arcanum, Bloodlines.Well, I could go on and on.  But like the game, I'll just cut myself off here.  When Deadly Waters has shown you its hand, it abruptly wraps up - unlike the dreary extended ending of Risen.			",168,46,1,23,15,1,34

												Best pirate game I've played. Not a bad RPG all in all, however if you prefer traditional RPGs I recommend this games predecessor or the original Gothic franchise. This game has a slightly different approach compared to the traditional level up with exp progression, however I don't find this irritating at all. Gorgeous scenery and fun quests, somewhat linear in places, however its not that far into the game, that you get access to the entire world for you to explore. I haven't played Treasure Isle dlc yet, but the air temple is interesting as a quest. Good build up and search for the temple, yet not much happens once you've found it, but good way to collect experience for later on. The natives are really fun to play around and the inquisition has had quite a few interesting alterations compared to the previous game. Funny dialogue. To begin with I felt the pirate theme was somewhat forced, however its easy to get used to and it truly does seem like a plausible world (also I love pirate themed stuff). The interaction with other characters is good, I haven't noticed any flaws (though there are a couple of intentionally irritating characters). Some really good skills to pick and choose from and the ending isn't dissappointing at all, and ties up loose ends with all recruited shipmates. For older pcs (dual core and low graphics memory) this game will be difficult to play, even if it says you meet the minimum requirements, quad core is I think best suited for minimum, game works brilliantly with 6 core and 2gb graphics memory (at least). All in all, I would recommend this to any fan of rpgs, however if you don't like alternative gameplay and prefer traditional rpgs (this game is non turn based in battle), this isn't really for you. I personally love it and if you love this (as mentioned before), definately try Risen 1 and the Gothic trilogy (with community patches). Hope this was helpful!			",165,46,2,26,12,0,21

												Plain and simple Risen 2 is an excellent game, with one flaw: combat. Combat goes from outright insane to♥♥♥♥♥♥easy and bosring over the game. Other than that, Risen 2 is an awesome game perfectly in line with other works from Piranha Bytes. In fact, I was surprised at how smoothly they managed to integrate a piratey settings with the cloak&dagger, sword&sorcery from Risen (and, previously, Cothic I and II: whose universe is technically unrelated to this one, although it does not really feel so).Overall, the game is really nice, and has an old-school feeling to it. risen 2 even caters some funny moments and the attempt at a couple of more serious ones (mostly crippled by the voice-acting, otherwise fine). The story is compelling enough and paced well enough to get you playing through all of it, there is certain (however small) degree of ""sandbox"", and some unexplored potential, but the game plays well and it turns out to be really enjoyable, and just the right length.8/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I hated this game in the beginning. Going straight from Risen 1 into this.....there is no comparison. I would have just loved a continuation of the story from 1 into 2, but that is not what happened. They removed a lot of the classic RPG feel the first one had. They did make the graphics better, but that is the only pro that I could really find. The combat changed so much, and melee has become useless in a wide number of situations unless you love dodging and rolling around everywhere.Combat and skills are so jarring from 1 to 2 it is best to think of them as 2 separate games. At first it seems like a cash grab and shoddily done because they changed so many of the main aspects. Story was decent. Nice playtime for how cheap I got it. Meh.			",24,2,0,15,8,0,10

												First game i've ever reviewed and only because this game is so brokenly terrible. I do not recommend anyone to waste their time on this broken game.The combat is terrible, there is hard lock in the game and only a soft lock onto targets that has nothing to do with you. Since you can't choose whom you lock onto the camera doesn't either so if the enemy moves out of range you have to try and track them, because you wont be locked onto them anymore when they are outside of view rendering you ""out of combat"". Enemies have 0 intellitence and just atk all the time, at an uninteruptible speed. Enemies CANT be interrupted but they can interrupt you. Your secondary attacks are completly random and miss 90% of the time rendering them useless. Your main attack is weak, doesn't connect a majority of the time and is disregarded by the computer.0/10 The game is unplayable.			",54,3,0,17,1,0,8

												This game isn't what I loved about Risen 1 - well written strong characters (like Inquisitor) and also all the characters in camps; mysterious, but still logic, escalating, complex story - for me one of the best; visible (not just skills but also cosmetic) progress of player's character and great music. Also realistic fighting system - with stuns, interruptions, dodges - different tactics against animals/humen/insects/other races. And cool interiors - like laboratory in monastery or the flame sanctuary. It seems to me that the devs tried to change features that players who didn't like their games wanted to change, but what their fans loved about Risen 1 is not really there. Yes, you can choose which island you will visit first, graphic is better, the story is still good, but there is no unknown hero  you could customize and you would be curious where it would develop - you play a well known hero who doesn't evolve in anything - he still looks the same, he talks like he knows it all, not even learning voodoo would change him to something more mystic. The islands have still nice natives/cities, but with no gradation - you just do some quests for them and that is all. Maybe it would be better if they would use the world of Risen but not the old hero - like they did it in Dragon Age - you could meet him, but your new hero would be yours and you could do really free choices. But still I would recommend this game - it is still a good game with a pirate theme. The fighting system is a torso of what it was before - so it wouldn't be difficult to learn it probably, but it is not rescripted, so it doesn't work as it could if it would be made new, but otherwise everything else is OK.

												I really, really like this game.I played it back when it was released on xbox360 (rented it), and really had a good time playing it, but didn't know if I wanted to spend $40 or whatever on it at that time.Then I found it on sale on Steam, for dirt cheap, and having progressed farther than I did when I had rented it, in hindsight I would now say that that $40 might have been well spent.If you are going into to it looking for a triple-A title like Assassin's Creed or Skyrim, you are probably going to be a little dissappointed.  However, if you go into it not expecting it to strictly adhere to standards set by other titles, looking for something similar to Skyrim but focused on pirates and voodoo instead of dragons and magic, you might be rather surprised with what you find.  I find the voice acting somewhere between entertaining to quite good.  The tropical ambiance, settlements (Inquisition, pirates, and savages), and wildlife look great.  The story is interesting for the most part (I found myself to be more inclined towards free-roaming and side-questing).So in conclusion, if you are like me and actually enjoyed Two Worlds 2, I think that you would also have a great time with this.  Ironic to end a review by compairing it to another game when I just tried to impress upon those reading to NOT do exactly that when going into it, but there you have it. :D10/10 Would contridict myself in a review and post it anyway again			",833,342,14,80,74,10,76

												Haven't been playing it all that long.. played Risen 1 for a few hours, didn't care for it.  The story was great but I found the AI  boring, not a lot of emotion or tone to them.  Didn't care for the fighting movement at all but that just might be my unfamiliarity with this kind of game.  THIS game though, Risen 2, I found much better than 1 for graphics (of course) and for movement when fighting, and I enjoy the voices and listening to the dialogue much much more than in 1.I have seen a lot of reviews for Risen 1 about the overall character and story being better... that might be true, as I said, I didn't play it long.  But I am really enjoying Risen 2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is fantastic. Feels like a good old-school RPG with modern looks. I am already about 40 hours into the game and it keeps amazing me. This game has everything that i expect from a good RPG - the difficulty is above average and the game really challenges you, so you feel satisfaction from the progress, the landscapes are beautiful, the dialogues have its' share of humor, number of quests available is just fantastic - so you won't run out of things to do. Overall - a great game that I strongly recommend!PS you will probably encounter a few minor glitches or bugs during the gameplay, but they are so minor that are almost not worth mentioning.

												Well I think that one of my favorite RPG game devs is Piranha Bytes, since Gothic series I have been playing all of their releases (Gothic series and Risen).Risen 2 is a bit different from the others is purely based on pirate adventures, but still keeps the essence from its predecessors, for example look and feel, exploring the world and always finding nice surprises, these little details are the ones that make you feel the game, not like many others just empty building shells, lifeless landscapes, etc.I dont understand why so many people complain about the pirate thing, I mean if they know about Piranha Bytes work they would know that the pirate touch has been present since Gothic, so I'm ok with it.In conclusion I would give the game 9/10 it is really a fun game and ok storyline, combat mechanics are not too bad, beautiful landscapes, only thing I didnt like is the lack of variety for outfits, it has plenty of weapons, fairly balanced  by the way, eventhough they seem to have high specs they are not too OP, so you still get to enjoy part of the fights.Well if you are looking to kill some time with a different RPG game I would suggest Risen 2 Dark Waters ;)			",300,44,8,41,18,0,21

												Poor fighting mechanics hurt this game enough to make it unplayable. While Risen 2 continues Piranha Byte's tradition of awesome open world exploration and interesting, handcrafted environments, the combat is so bad that the game is just no fun to play. I would highly recommend going back and playing Risen 1 instead as it has more Skyrim-esque (third person) combat controls and is far better gameplay and performance-wise.			",217,58,7,22,10,1,20

												Full of potential and other issues. The graphics are well done although distant fauna ""blooms"" visably and restores have objects popping up from the depths of the programmed underworld - which is funny to watch. Movement is a little stiff but one gets used to it. The quests are reasonable, the leveling up is competent. I just wish that they had not fired the QA team after the second of several islands became available. That's the only thing that made sense to me. The bugs and inconsistencies in dialogue, the growing graphics stuttering, all this and more grew worse and worse as the game progressed. It got to the point where I was restarting every hour just to keep playing. And that is just one issue, I can think of more off the top of my head. Each of them by themself is a non-breaking issue. You can still play, you can still win (although you may go Huh?) but when you put them all together, well - it's just tiring.I REALLY wanted this. The premise is first rate, the original was fun if not a little ""off"" at times, and then it went downhill in the first scene. I still played the stubborn pirate like a stubborn pirate and put up with it until completed. Filled with a sense of accomplishment I went back to mine a few steam achievements - only to discover more quirks preventing further play. Starting over is not a worth-while option.In fact, I'm not sure starting at all was a good decision in hindsight. ",214,63,25,24,19,0,11

												Risen 2 is a pretty nice improvement on the original. The pirate theme is a welcome change in this RPG market of nothing but elves & dwarves, the story & characters are much more enjoyable & memorable even though the story is the standard chosen one must rise to save the world & most of the NPC models look the same. Unfortunately the combat while improved still suffers from the same tedium that the original had. Improving skills is also just as annoying as the first, you will never have enough gold & everything costs it even quite a few quests. Still while the Risen series has so far had many an issue the games are still enjoyable enough for me to recommend them. Here’s hoping for a Risen 3 & that they keep the pirate theme.

												I would like to finish this game, just to complete the story, but the gameplay itself is just too tedious for me to justify wasting all that time.This saddens me, because I generally like the world and exploration. The story isn't mind blowing - but hey, Pirates, Sea Gods, and Colonial might, there's nothing wrong with any of that and it would make for an enjoyable jaunt if only the gameplay held up to allow the story to be told.Combat is slow and uninspired. I've never found combat in a Gothic game to be particularly good, this just took the cake in terms of rigidity and slowness. It's a bit like Demon Souls with crappy controls (which basically makes the combat). Reading a few of the other reviews, I guess I responded quite negatively to the combat as you would expect SOME sort of improvement in the combat of this series, but things have not progressed since Gothic 2. Back then there was so much NEW stuff that these games were doing, that you could accept a bit of dodgy combat stuff. But this isn't new. It's prettier, and in a different setting, but there's nothing new here.Toward the end of my session I found myself switching on God mode, purely so I could skip through most of the frustratingly combat stuff and focus on the story and exploration. But after a few hours I thought to myself, ""What am I doing? This isn't how the game is supposed to be played"". The whole point of this uncompromising style was that there were some places you just weren't supposed to go at the start, but God mode ruins that - even though I wasn't trying to break it, I just couldn't be bothered dealing with the combat system.So if I felt inclined to destroy the unique aspect of this series, just so I could run around talking to people and gathering stuff, that basically signals that something is horribly wrong with the balance of this game.Graphically it's pretty. Story is ok, and the world is actually quite interesting. Kudos for that.But I won't be getting back into this series until something changes with the combat. Enough time has passed that this cannot be accepted anymore.			",117,49,0,19,15,1,30

												What's improved in this sequel? Early combat, graphics. story, game design/environment, quests, camera a little bitStayed the same? Movement, some of the combat (sometimes you can get ""attack-locked"", meaning a monster keeps attacking you so fast you cant block.. this is very frustrating) as well as the voice acting. The game bugs out as well every now and then.Made it worse? Picking up items like food is considered stealing and makes guards angry at you even though the food was clearly there on display for visitors to take. what the ♥♥♥♥? Also the low early gold really holds you back and you waste a lot of time going back and forth between camps/bases. Lightning strikes (weather) are more like flashes and don't look good. There is a shortage of food because of having to fight so many enemies with flawed combat.This is a early first impression ""review"". I just want to say that the game is very similar to the first one of the series and the combat/movement and overwhelming enemies thing is still there. 8.5/10 so far, with combat holding it back. Will edit this after I'm done with the game.			",640,166,16,115,52,7,80

												Horrifically poorly optimized game with models close to on par with the original half-life, Pathetic animations, and Shallow, bland, and tedious combat. This is a game with an extremely slow beggining only to become just barely mediocre later on. (and I'll have to take peoples word word the mediocrity later on, I didn't have the patience for this garbage) In other words: Don't even buy this game for your worst enemy. The devs don't deserve money for this crap.If you want a pirate game, go buy assasain's creed 4 instead. At least it's pretty decent.			",82,10,3,9,7,0,7

												The reviews that the critics gave this game were right.I just can't see how people can stand up for this game, it's just plain bad.First of all, the animations  the characters have during conversations are just disturbingly bad to watch, I mean seriously who moves there hands like that when they are talking about going down to the beach to get some washed up boxes?The voice acting as well is very poor. Another thing, is that the quests are hard to find where you're supposed to go because it doesn't show you where the hell you are supposed to go, well this was my trouble with it. Also, your companion is usless, if you are trying to be stealthy or trying different tactics, the companions ai will ignore everying and just run around doing nothing. I was fighting a group of enemy mobs and she didnt not help at all with my fight against them, she just sat back and kept cycling through her bland dialouge, when i was about to finish off the last mob however, she decided to one shot it with her musket -_-. The combat in this game too is just so boring, theres nothing to it but just swinging your sword and waing every 90 second to shoot your musket, theres a parry mechanic too but that seemed to never work for me when i used it.Overall my expiernce in this game was very poor, I wouldn't even recomend it for the 5$ I payed for it.3/10 There are so many better games out there.

												Horrifically poorly optimized game with models close to on par with the original half-life, Pathetic animations, and Shallow, bland, and tedious combat. This is a game with an extremely slow beggining only to become just barely mediocre later on. (and I'll have to take peoples word word the mediocrity later on, I didn't have the patience for this garbage) In other words: Don't even buy this game for your worst enemy. The devs don't deserve money for this crap.If you want a pirate game, go buy assasain's creed 4 instead. At least it's pretty decent.			",82,10,3,9,7,0,7

												I really enjoyed playing Risen 2. It's not as good as Gothic 2 or Risen, but still a very charming game with a nice atmosphere, good graphics (except for the animations, but the Piranhas where never good at this :D), great characters and of course a brilliant soundtrack. If you enjoyed the Gothic series or liked the first Risen game, you should get this. If you expect this to be a new Elder Scrolls or The Witcher, keep your hands off this game! The game gets a 8.4/10 from me.			",485,108,49,44,49,5,59

												If you liked Risen 1 or Gothic games, you will like Risen 2.  If you are new to the series well... you will either love it or hate it.  Risen games, like the older Gothic games, are generally viewed favorably with the exception they have some plot holes, story holes, and bugs.  Normally that would be really bad but there just aren't that many good RPGs of this type out there to choose from... and what does work, works well.  The exploration and adventure parts of this game are above average, as well as the background music.  I will add parts of this game are really stupid, and others very frustrating.... but was it worth it?  Yes, especially if you can nab it at a steep discount.  If you are looking for a simple point and click, this isn't for you... if you like a challenge and can get through the first 10 hours without breaking your keyboard then I'd say your in for a great time.  If your system can handle it, the graphics on Ultra setting are still good as of Dec 2013.  The good:  Lots of good quests, exploration, suprises, good loot, many ways to accomplish tasksThe bad:  Fights are very, very frustrating in the beginning... but yes it does get better as you go.In closing, I'd say do yourself a favor and invest 10 hours before you give up on it.... if after that point you aren't sucked in a bit, then go ahead and call it a day as this game is not for you.

												Arr! Risen 2 can be described as Gothic with better graphics and with pirates. You embark on an adventure as a spy for the Inquisition and become a pirate captain in the process. What will you do from there? Will you improve your piratey skills of thievery, intimidation and lockpicking? Or perhaps learn voodoo? Stay clear off any criminal action and try to be a decent lawful citizen? It's up to you how you approach the quests. The game is a bit limited at first, but as you progress and get your ship, you have a lot of location available to explore and need to find a way to get to others. The main character is a bit too posh for a pirate, but fun to play as. The visual part of the game might seem a bit outdated, but it's a 2012 game and the details are pretty nice to the eye. One of the nicest aspects of Risen 2 is the jungle. It's vivid and has a nice feel. The map has some hotspots for fast travel which really helps when switching locations.If you played Gothic and enjoyed the hermetic feeling of being forced to figure out a way to get out from a limited area that gives you a chance to learn the game mechanics, so that later you have a more vast variety of choices and locations -  this is the game you might want to check out. It's not Gothic, and the plot is very different, though.If you haven't played Gothic and don't know what to expect from the gameplay, be ready for a title that doesn't make it easy for the player when it comes for combat. You need to earn your way to improve your combat prowess, and also learn how to use the mechanics in the way that benefits you the most.Decent game and it's very fun to play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Risen 2: Dark Waters gets a lot of things right. For example, the game has at times near photorealistic graphics; the leveling, experience (glory) systems are well balanced; and the difficulty on medium is challenging but not frustrating. Sometimes the graphics can just be average/good but they still feel quaint. Gold seems fairly difficult to come by and also seems well-balanced. There are some neat items/equipment and skills to buy with the limited gold you have. I didn't list all the positives. The game is pick up and play friendly with a save anywhere system. Not sure if you can save during fights. I give it an 8.5/10.			",35,4,4,10,12,0,13

												Несмотря на некоторые нелестные комментарии игровых журналистов, я считаю, что это лучшая игра жанра RPG. Смесь старой-доброй Готики и Корсаров придало игре свежести, которой, возможно, ей как раз и не хватало.Игра не растеряла ни капли своей обаятельности, и даже больше - она напоминает почему-то именно первые две 'Готики'.Горячо рекомендую как любитель всей серии.

												Well my first impression after opening the game was what the ♥♥♥♥ happened to the place I saved in ""Risen 1"". Then they introduce the Hero and I was like who the ♥♥♥♥ is this long haired, One-eyed ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? I almost lost interest from the get-go. lolThen I played for a bit, now Commandant Carlos is now a fat dude. Well at least Patty was hotter than in the first game.After playing the game (and reading on the wiki) I now know what happened to the Nameless Hero. Apparently he was blamed for what happened in Faranga. Got his eye destroyed by the Monocle from Inquisitor Mendoza which turned out to be cursed. The ban of magic also forced him to let go of the titan armor (what a waste).All in All my final verdict is that Risen 1 is better and far more engaging than Risen 2, however Risen 2 is still a good game.Pros:There are a lot more place to explore in this game.You're a pirate? Yarrr?Animations are better at least there are a lot more diversity in the looks of NPC's.Companion System.....?Better fast travel than in Risen 1.If in 1 you got Lizardmen in 2 you'll get gargoyles that looks like dragons standing on 2 legs weilding an axe.You'll get to meet some of the people from Risen 1 in better graphics and new models.Cons:The animations are still clunky, but can be overlooked.Sometimes (Most of the time?) when exploring, it felt like a walking simulator.Lore didn't get me as hooked, so it felt like a chore to finish the game.The Pirate ship could have been more than Aesthetics, like naval battles, for cryin' out loud you have sea monsters.Professions (crafting) and Factions are useless.I've read that the game was rushed etc, so that's why it wasn't that polished but it's still a good game.

												I bought it for 75% off during winter sale, and the game was a lot of fun. Some quest were the usual ""get me 10 things"" or ""kill the 5 somethings"". But in general most of the quest were ok.I found some minor problems concerning bugs. Sometimes dialog options were not accessible anymore, when proceeding too far in the game. Some maximum skills cannot be learned, because the trainer does not provide you the dialog option after completing some main quests. Also some potions cannot be created, because the recipes cannot be bought. But cheats do exist ;-)Apart from that I can definitely recommend the game for all people who like action RPGs.Some hints for developing the character:- Forget voodoo and alchemy, it doesn't provide you combat magic. 99% of the potions raise your skills only for some seconds.- Raise your blade skills (counter attack) very early, because there is no trainer on the second island. It makes you very weak for some hours.- Raise your thief (lockpick) skills very early, because you will find many hidden and locked chests on the islands.- Smithing is not that important. You can create 4-6 standard blades and repair 4 special blades (you have to find first).Some other tips and comments:- For every item you want to craft, you have to find/buy/steal a recipe. They are very rare and expensive.- When you cannot open a chest, write down the position on a piece of paper. You will forget where to find it in the jungle of a certain island a second time.- After leaving for the final quest, you will not be able to return for completing open ones. After killing the last boss, the game ends.- You don't need the plants when not performing alchemy. So eat them to regenerate.- If you follow the voodoo path (helping the tribes): As soon as you can sail to the island of the dead, do it. It provides you a tool to summon someone.Well, that's all that comes to my mind.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't think Risen 2 should be getting as much hate as it has gotten. It's a worthwhile title, especially on sale. I'm a huge RPG fan and I'm really enjoying myself. Well worth the $5 or so that I payed (I think it was less than that actually, but not even sure)I'd give it a 7/10. Pirates are fun. Not sure it's worth playing on the harder difficulties, but going through it on easy is great. Fun world to explore, and it's given me more laughs than alot of stand-up comedy acts do.

												Great game.  Was only ok in the beginning as you don't have any skills or any money.  As you get further in the game it gets a lot better.   Combat is a little weird with how counter attacks work, but still enjoyable.  Pros+Decent graphics+Good voice acting and dialogue+Solid storylineCons-slow beginning ",110,20,0,44,29,0,61

												It's the second game of the Risen trilogy. Honestly, the game seems to be placed in a different world and there's no feeling of playing a sequel. The story seemingly takes place in a different historical settings, like decades or even centuries has passed since the first chapter. All places visited, technology and architecture and even system of magic has been changed and game has no longer a fantasy-like appearance. Despite that fact, I think that the game is worth playing and gives the player an interesting story to uncover. I enjoyed the task of completing a crew for your ship and possibility of travelling with one companion at a time. It made long walks in the wilderness not as lonely as in the first game. I also really like that authors made gnomes into civilized race, instead of them being just monsters. One of them can even become your follower, a useful one if you want to quickly examine your fallen opponents. New magic system at first looked strange, but voodoo possesion turned out to be something fresh and interesting.  I recommend the game for people who like action RPG.			",20,12,0,7,4,0,3

												I can't not begin to explain how f***King amazing this game is!!!Yes its not some grafics master piece or legendary combat styling game, but its simple.It has all the charatristics any everyday pirate/human has. No crazy moves or insame HP/MP bars, thisgame really does put you on the spot.Story line wise I enjoyed it alot.Only thing that was annoying was the combat area, cant really focus on something to attack on and when you want to attacka different enemy you have to completely stop and move towards the other guy.10/10 for me. It might look corny but trust me, i paid 4.99US for this game and it feels like it should of been 39.99USbtw theres this new pirate movie out its rated RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR get it?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nice RPG from the same team that did the original Gothic. And less buggy than Gothic, I only found two glitches that affected game play. Although it's a sequal, it doesn't matter if you've played Risen or not as it is in another part of the world and you don't miss much. World was enjoyable, but backwards - the end of the game was stupidly easy, unlike the first. Unlike Gothic, the world isn't quite as dangerous (shadowbeasts ftw!), but just like Gothic, there's lots to discover and explore. Overall, an enjoyable game and well worth sinking in a good few hours to fully experiance the story.			",227,71,2,30,24,1,56

												The game sucks.- Bad camera panning in and out during conversations - not smoothly, but jumping to a new zoom level by itself.- Zooming in/out with a controller is unnecessarily complicated and does not work very well (you have to push both axis joysticks and push one forward and the other down)- Absolutely crap sword fighting mechanics, just about the worst I saw in a game. You have just 1 basic attack and a parry mode which rarely works. No dodge ability so you have to just mash the attack button. You can get defeated by a random crab or whatever if you're unlucky to be hit constantly just when you want to attack, as it will interrupt your attack. I can't think of a game with worst combat mechanics. Oh and the pistol takes forever to reload (30-60 seconds as I recall, feels like an eternety) and often misses. Played iPhone games with better combat mechanics than this.- Terrible, completely terrible voice acting. It's not even synced to the characters.- Dialogues aren't that great either, the effort put into the dialogues and voices altogether is no better than on an iPhone game.- Story isn't great and the dialogues don't help make it better.- The main character jumps very weird. The DEV team should look into other games for how the jump should work.Graphics are nice, except that the environment looks nicer than the characters...Got this game in a bundle and still feels like I wasted my money.

												I can't for the life of me recommend this.Coming from someone who loves open world games, who likes the idea of going forth the second you're done with the tutorial, this game isn't the option for me. I looked through the reviews here, and it says that around the third hour you'll have amassed enough experience (or fame in this game) and money where you can actually begin to truly experience it.I'm don't get games to endure a good 3 hours of it in order to see the real meat. I want that presented to me, THEN a barrier or two has me grind through the experience.Another complaint I have is the fact that the grinding required to do anything. 1,000 glory to start amassing skill points, even moreso after. You get 52 per monster kill.It doesn't require a huge amount of mathematics to determine that you'll be grinding ALL. DAY.There are other indie RPG games out there that are able to execute what Risen 2 has been trying to do. Maybe if the game goes on a major sale again, it might be worth it. But spend no more than 5 bucks on it.Me? I regret doing even that.			",309,46,2,53,20,0,38

												After completing the game, I have mixed feelings.First, you can't take this game seriously. It's got intricacies and bugs like none other. Everyone talks like they're speaking sign language. You will complete missions before you are given them. At times, you will breeze through the combat. Other times, you will fire 180 degrees away from the enemies, roll into attacks, and instead of casting or shooting, the character will put down their weapon. Fighting is fun when it works. A lot of the time, it doesn't.You are constantly picking flowers, and you can't help but look like a pansy. Cutscenes will skip without your consent. You can beat people up, rob them blind, and STILL they'll help you a few moments later. You recover healh slowly by eating food and quickly by drinking booze or sleeping on a random bed you happen across out in the open in the jungle. Auto-save will happen about once every 5 minutes to 3 hours.You spend the whole game searching for amulets to defeat the ultimate evil... but in the end you don't really ever use them. The second to last boss will be unreachable for most of the game, but every 12 seconds will alternate between using the same predictable attack, and opening itself for retaliation... A leviathan monster, the Kraken, capeable of sinking ships.The rest of the time... you wait.But, it's all-in-all, a pretty alright RPG. You have the leveling system, unlocking abilities, a choice between two factions, a gaggle of creatures with varying abilities, minigames. It's all nothing new, nothing you haven't seen plenty of times elsewhere. But it was still fun.			",35,14,2,17,18,0,13

												I've actually published a long review for this game on another website but I'll try to list the most crucial points here:StoryAlthough this game is a direct sequel to the first game, it seems like all your previous choices were simply neglected. Despite the fact that the indigent hero saved the world before, he's now working as an employee for the Inquisition and is also an alcoholic. Well, since it's a game about pirates, there's that famous eye-patch cliché (alongside others, such as buried treasures), and the reason for that has to be one of the stupidest ideas I've ever seen. If you've already played the game you'll know what I'm saying. Oh, by the way, Patty is back... Anyway, if in the previous game you've created any positive expectative about her, in Risen 2 just a few moments under her presence is more than enough to make you wanna just shove her into one of the ship's cannons and fire her into oblivion.GameplayThe gameplay haven't changed much, except perhaps for the possibility of now being able to use firearms, which certainly makes life much easier when compared to the first game. The prices everywhere are still outrageous and the chests of loot that you find lying around are often filled with cheap and useless crap. Besides that, you may now have a companion to assist you during the battles, but the AI is extremely dumb when it comes to follow you, so it's not uncommon to fight several enemies all by yourself while your companion is ""making out"" with a tree or something. Compared to the first game, the fast travel method has significantly improved too. Ah, the main character's pocket still has the size of the universe!Graphics / SoundThe visuals look nice (I really like the day to night transition effects) and the OST isn't that bad either, although it's nothing exceptional. As for the voice acting, somehow they've managed to make it worse than before. For instance, it looks like the main character is a pothead by the way he speaks. As for the other characters, there're moments that are meant to be sad but the acting is so awful that it makes the scene extremely funny.GlitchesJust like in the first game, this one won't disappoint you when it comes to find these around, not to mention a few random crashes (although they're much less frustrating than on the first game). The weirdest one I've met during my gameplay happened right after I killed one of the bosses. After doing it, when I'd try to jump, I'd keep going higher and higher (I believe I can fly). Ah, it was also really funny to talk to a floating Patty.Overall, while this game brings many improvements compared to the first one, it still has a fair share of flaws (it also happens to be shorter too). To be fair, it's not a masterpiece but it's actually fun if you actually buy it with a nice discount.			",411,101,12,62,39,7,46

												A major step back. The setting had everything going for it and the npcs/towns were up to par for the developer. The story was enticing.But... horrible, and I do mean horrible, combat. Most of the cool abilities are twitch button mashing and only work against people, while most of the opponents are animals that you can't even block. Add to that a drastic reduction in the crafting (weapons and alchemy) from prior titles and so many core features that weren't even finished.			",155,55,0,58,57,0,71

												By FAR one of the top 5 worst games I have ever played. This is just a horrible,♥♥♥♥♥♥game. And not in my opinion. I mean generally speaking, this game ♥♥♥♥ing sucks bad. Two main reasons (aside from the game being generally god awful) I won't ever be playing this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game again. 1- Combat consists of clicking mouse 1 as fast as you can until something is dead and hoping they dont take too much life from you. Parrying barely works. Combat is horribly clunky beyond words. 2- There are NO waypoints or directions so you wander around until you find, with luck, who you are looking for.I can without hesitation say that the combat in this game is some of if not THE WORST combat I have ever seen in a game in my life. Jesus God almighty does the combat ♥♥♥♥ing absolutely suck in every way imaginable.And no I'm not dumb enough to pay more than $1 at humblebundle.com for games like this. It only cost $1 to find out if it had any redeeming qualities, in which it had exactly zero.			",598,87,12,48,22,5,43

												This is probably the worst game I've ever played.I'm not even sure where I should start with this. How did they ♥♥♥♥ up a pirate game?There's nothing redeeming about this mess, I'd tell you the story, but after two hours I already forgot it. Not even the graphics look good, it seems like they wanted to make something similar to The Witcher 2 with all the filters they used, but the overworld looks shallow and the filters and the overused bloom effect just manage to hurt your eyes. You can apparently just visit a few islands that in them barely have any content at all, a few houses, 5 to 10 NPCs and that's it. The animations are one of the worst things I've experienced in this generation, they are not even close to movements, and trust me you'll see plenty of them since every time a line of dialogue is spoken, the charachter talking will amuse you with them.And, by the way, the dialogues sound like they got random people off the street to record them. Even a kid could make something better than what they choose.But the worst thing about this is probably the combat system, if you really want to call it that. It's just a mess, there's no strategy, every ability costs too much to be bought and you'll spend the first 3 hours in this game just randomly slashing at enemies in the hope of killing them and then going back to a town to heal. And I'm not even sure if after the first terrible hours in the game it'll get better. This is neither fun or RPG-like, it's just boring, boring to the point I'm here wishing I had never payed that dollar in the Humble Bundle for this thing.Please, please, don't buy this, why does this have so many people playing it at once? I don't get it, am I the only one that can see how unfinished and unpolished this game is?			",130,24,4,13,12,0,10

I personally prefer a game with more to it then left click spam. this game isn't anything special not worth the money. best to get it for a dollar or not at all you aren't missing anything. but hey it is better then the first one			",99,6,2,3,5,0,11

												It's a Disaster! This game is a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ I dont know what the creators were thinking to create a Pirate game without main Pirate things, for example: You can't swim! what a hell Pirate RPG is that where a Pirate Captain can't swim, another point you can't go onto the sea and also you can't controll your own ship, wtf! all is happening is a 5sec cutscene on the sea when you Travelling! and now This character is the worst Pirate ever, he don't even know how to fight properly or pickpocking or even open a ♥♥♥♥ing chest, and to get these skills you must learn them and you also have to pay for them and now we get to the Money... at the beginning of the game you don't have nothing and the game just ruin your game with low rewards, but later you can get into it then bored it. The Leveling-Upgrade system is♥♥♥♥♥♥., but there is good things, like voices or few moments, thats it! P.S. Do not try to Jump! Worst Jumping system in RPG ever!... 4/10.

												A thoroughly engaging pirate romp in a wonderfully designed open-world - that's how I'd summarize Risen 2.It's not perfect, but it's close to what I personally look for in my ""perfect RPG"". Rewarding exploration, open-world, interconnected dialog and questing system, interesting characters and story, tons of loot to plunder and adventure around every hand-crafted nook and cranny that you find. I would say this game is a must-play if you are into RPGs at all. At first I didn't think I would like a pirate setting as I'm more into medieval settings, but the setting was so well-crafted that I quickly became hooked until I completed the game in just about 60 hours.Well worth checking out if you're a fan of RPG games. Buy it now! :)			",39,31,0,79,8,2,28

												I'm absolutely sick of people giving this a positive review saying ""well it's♥♥♥♥♥♥but kinda less♥♥♥♥♥♥than the last one"". This game has the worst fighting system I've ever seen, leveling up is a chore, every skill costs a fortune and your character who is supposed to save the world can barely hold the sword for the first 5 hours of the game and misses every other shot in point blank range. Meanwhile your opponents have unblockable attacks, do not stop their animations even when get hit even though that applies to you. A flask of grog to the one who wins any swordfight in the early game in other way than by rolling around the enemy like an idiot and shooting them with the pistol. You have to pay 1000 gold to LEARN HOW TO KICK. FFS. I've had enough of this garbage.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's not a Skyrim or Kingdom of Amalur, but it's definitely got a charm all of it's own.  I hope  some one  releases some texture mods  soon as I do think the graphics are below par for such a game, especially the  backgrounds. That said, it's  got some   excellent game play.  I've only just started    exploring the game, so can't  really say whether it was worth paying full price  for yet, but  if you are into RPG's  you really need to purchase this one either now or when its on a deal. (probably the next  summer sale).  It's  definitely an improvement on the original released   2 or 3 years ago.			",4947,1934,224,565,877,79,758

												In a few ways it's a better game than Risen 1.It looks better, there's more places to visit, and it's gotten itself a piratey theme ARR. The atmosphere is quite good in this game too. Unfortunately the combat's become even worse. At least it looks better now, but it's just horrible to control. Basically you'll just end up mashing attacks until creature dies, no more thought needed for combat, no more timing, no more deadly attacks from enemies... It's kind of too bad.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Since I own so many games I 'had' to rush through this one unfortunately. RPG's are usually to big to complete properly.If you've ever played the Gothic games (except 4) then you actually know how combat and learning skills work in Risen 2 as well. It's pretty much an exact copy. The fights can become tedious and frustrating sometimes, especially with the glitchy/cheaty AI. On the other hand it does feel good when you finally defeat that annoying opponent.The game is filled with quests and treasures and exploration is being rewarded. I remember Gothic 3 doing the same thing, meaning; lots of exploration and no(t) (too much) hand holding when doing quests. It gave a sense of immersion.The graphics are colorful most of the times and fit the theme well. The whole thing can become glitchy sometimes.The voice overs are ok-ish. They're not terribly bad. The writing is at times, though.I enjoyed Risen 2 a lot, and you can get twice the amount of playtime if you do literally everything.[Rating: 77/100]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I enjoyed this, a good ~40 hours of adventure, exploration, story and combat. It has a major choice to make at the start that ends up branching quite significantly so there's a lot of room for replayability. This crashed on me once but with frequent autosaves it wasn't really an issue. The autosaves themselves also track quite far back for quite a number (easily 10+). Same for quick saves.I used a controller for this as there are only a few times you need to aim unless you want to use guns a lot but even then it's quite forgiving. The few minigames also tone down for the controller, switching back to keyboard/mouse for them doesn't give you an advantage as they then ramp back up difficulty wise.It's not necessary to have played the original but there are a few references to it here and there. The story can be completed in any order with a variety of ways to approach quests and solve problems. I found the combat quite difficult initially. I am confused by the low metacritic score. All in all this is a very solid choice for anyone who enjoys RPGs of this setting.			",160,21,6,31,14,0,25

												Outstanding game and a worthy successor for Gothic/Risen series (thanks to PB), but its release is a blatant rip-off (""thanks"" to its publisher Deep Silver and their pseudo-DLC tactics, when they just cut out some of the game content and sell it separately for a significant price).The game design is just right. There's NO grinding, you really need to EARN gold and treasure search is interesting and satisfying.The graphics are breathtaking and lots of times I wanted to switch the game to first-person mode.The music by Tilman Sillescu is amazing. It's not Kai Rosenkratz anymore, but new composer did his job very, very well. The dialogues are well-written and characters are memorable. The only complaint I have about the plot is that portrayal of pirates here is not true, it's kiddish and very, very far from real.English voice acting is simply PHENOMENAL. It's such a rare case for videogames in general, you just need to listen it for yourself.As of 2014, there are almost no bugs. The left ones are very minor and don't ruin game experience.If you're long-time fan, you may find beginning of this game to be pretty disappointing. But in this case you really should give it a chance.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unlike the earlier Gothic games Risen 2 is painfully linear.  It consists mostly of pointless fetch quests, bland scripted boss fights, and instadeath  traps that require you to reload ( and load times are remarkably slow). Firearms completely unbalance the game.  Piranha Bytes is the only developer I can think of who seem to get progressively worse with every new game.  If only they would go back to the formula that made Gothic 1 and 2 so great.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Arrr... you scury sea dogs! I'm Guybrush Threepwood and I wanna be a pirate..."" Wait a minute... thats the wrong game. Well at least after beating the first part of Risen I found myself on the quest on completing this one playing as  a pirate. The start of the game left me scratch my head a bit, as the story wasn't picking up the pace in comparision with the previous title. After a while (leaving the second island occuping your own ship) the quest to defeat the evil sea godess ""Mara"" is getting more interesting. In general the flumsy combat system and especially the use of firearms isn't much fun, however after beating a vicious enemy (finally) feels quite compelling. On the bright sight the setting and the companions you get during your ""journey"" is quite rewarding and the search for ""legendary items"" is keeping up the motivation (mine at least). In total the title has it's pro's and con's, but looking at my time I spent within this title I can recommend this title for people who like pirates and always wanted to command their own ship, like to use Voodoo magic/Firearms and want to collect treasures and legendary items.

												I have tried everything possible to launch this game and it will NOT PLAY.I have deleted the local content and reinstalled it 3 times. I have followed every instruction STEAM gives on troubleshooting this game, Verifyed the game cache 6 times and it always comes out that one file did not verify and will be reacquired. But jujdging by no matter what I do this game NEV+ER works I'm thinking that missing file never gets reacquired.Save your money. Neither STEAM nor the vendor will communicate any solutions or even accept responsibilty for selling a bogus product. Which more and more is becoming the norm nowdays with PC games. Once they got your money it's tough liuck for you if the game doesn;t work,I have a $6,000 built from the ground up system that plays most games seamless and beautifully so I know it is the install or the game itself that is the problem.

												Brings me back to the days of Gothic. PB does an excellent job with this title and they are great at making RPGs that are difficult yet satisfying. I wish it was longer because the ending is a bit too short and anticlimactic in a way but overall this is one of the better RPGs I've played in a while.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Arrr... you scury sea dogs! I'm Guybrush Threepwood and I wanna be a pirate..."" Wait a minute... thats the wrong game. Well at least after beating the first part of Risen I found myself on the quest on completing this one playing as  a pirate. The start of the game left me scratch my head a bit, as the story wasn't picking up the pace in comparision with the previous title. After a while (leaving the second island occuping your own ship) the quest to defeat the evil sea godess ""Mara"" is getting more interesting. In general the flumsy combat system and especially the use of firearms isn't much fun, however after beating a vicious enemy (finally) feels quite compelling. On the bright sight the setting and the companions you get during your ""journey"" is quite rewarding and the search for ""legendary items"" is keeping up the motivation (mine at least). In total the title has it's pro's and con's, but looking at my time I spent within this title I can recommend this title for people who like pirates and always wanted to command their own ship, like to use Voodoo magic/Firearms and want to collect treasures and legendary items.

I really enjoyed the theme and the story. Chasing after Mara and all the captains was pretty satisfing and gameplay was quite hard as it always is in Gothic/Risen series. I actually recommend this if you played Risen or any Gothic 1-3 series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If your computer is running on a Nvidia driver, make sure 3D drivers aren't installed because the game will lag to ungodly proportions.With that out of the way, Risen 2 is certainly not perfect but it has its charms of a pirate game.  I didn't play the first game, so I wasn't as horribly disappointed like some other fans of the first game.  The animation is cheap, but the dialogue makes up for it and the graphics itself is nice with the tropical environment.  Since blood and violence don't warrant an M rating in my book, the excessive swearing does end up warranting a mature rating as pirates use sailor's language to talking about women's bodies, shagging organisms, and the f-word like it's going out of style.  The side quests were more interesting than the main story, sadly, but side quests are fun to do since you will have to run around town quite a bit or backtrack during the main quest.Gold is key here since combat is hard even on easy mode.  The learning curve is steep because you need to spend gold on learning how to dodge, parry, riposte, and other things.  Yes, you will have to spend a fortune to learn the skills necessary to survive.  Mashing X is going to be hard if you haven't saved money to learn how to dodge, parry, or counter attack.  A frustrating bit about the combat was that it took me a while to realize that going to the inventory to restore my health was a terrible idea, because the MC will have put away his sword and I had to quickly pull it out to guard.  But halfway through the game gets easier as you do a bunch of sidequests that award you glory points (for leveling up attributes) and gold.  Because it costs more and more glory points to level up an attribute (Ex: Level 2=1000, 3=2000, etc), it's wise to figure out what kind of fighting style you want, melee, voodoo, or rifles.  Toughness is important for staying alive and cunning helps to bypass speech checks that would save you the trouble of fighting or getting loot.  A tip is that you don't have to max out the attributes because points can be supplemented with your equipment's passive boosts, unless you want the achievement that comes with it.Overall, I'd say give this game a chance with low expectations when it goes on sale if you're looking for a lighthearted pirate adventure with some plot twist here and there.

												Well, by today's standards the game mechanics might seem a little dated. You can even argue that it's a bad thing... However, if you were old enough to play Gothic (and, especially, Gothic II) back in the day, you'll know exactly what's in store with this game. If you did adore Gothic games (like I did), the chances are you'll enjoy Risen 2 as well.If you consider the game for its pirate setting, it's a worthy pick. The pirates constantly swear, drink, pick fights and look for treasures, and your hero fits the pirate shoes perfectly from the intro cutscene.			",191,65,4,45,18,1,61

												Picked it up on sale as part of the Humble Deep Silver Bundle 2. Gave it a go for a few hours but it didn't really 'hook' me in. I was put off by the clunky combat, outdated visual/animations, terrible voice acting, and dumb-as-a-rock AI system... Reading through the forums, it sounds like it does get better in the second half of the game; however, with 20 - 30 hrs of main story quests, that would take a lot of dedication to get to the 'good parts'. I'll still give it the thumbs up to promote a low-cost, old-school RPG with loads of content.			",51,28,0,8,4,0,4

												Risen 2 changes it main emphasis onto the pirate theme for the majority of the game & it absolutely pays off. Simply put: putting the focus on the pirating theme is excellent, as this game absolutely nails the pirates theme. From the envirionments to the actual atmosphere of the game-world and its actual inhabitants, the pirating theme here is just extremely well done + the player will get immersed into the game and its world.As always with PB's games, the level of interactivity & immersion factor is high; & NPC's run on schedules. There are choices to often make to finish quests differently, as usual. The camera is now unlocked, so moving left or right doesn't strafe. The up-side: this makes it easier to battle numerous enemies & swing directly to them. The down-side: to strafe now, you have to hold your Secondary Action key. These control changes do take some time to get used to, if you're used to Risen 1's controls. A key for rolling would've helped, since double-tapping a direction makes your character roll - which can happen accidentally. The feel of the combat itself & its controls do again feel clunky, even though this is par for the course w/ PB RPG's since Gothic 1. Even despite its few minor issues, Risen 2 is another really good RPG from PB & easy to reccommend.Grade = B			",894,314,36,138,76,13,111

												75 out of 100.It takes times (for me, 15 hours of play) to appreciate (or immerse into) this game. One of the main problems is that our hero is far from attractive, neither is his girl partner Patty. A role-playing game is a role-playing, hence if I do not feel for the main character, everything is meaningless. There are some racial issues in this game, some players may be offended.Though, after 15 hours of play I can gradually (how slow, compared to other RPGs) enjoy this game. I like the vodoo part, (you can become othere but when doing so it is not allowed to save the game, what a stupid design!) and the player really needs to ""solve"" quests, as there is no goal-indictator, rather than just clicking from one place to another following the auto quest-navigation system like many nowaday's RPGs. The graphic is superb, the music is good but too monotonic if you play a long time, the plot is average, the characters and actions are quite unattractive.			",94,77,1,22,6,0,2

I had a lot of fun playing this game, everything isnt just handed to you in Risen it is definatly earned. If your looking for an extended pirate adventure with plenty of grinding and exploring involved, then you should play this. Sure you might have to mess with the video settings a bit to get your FPS right but thats pretty much it. Explore the seas and collect treasures from all over the seas while fighting away a curse dammed to you by the evil sea witch Mara. Explore and prevail in your quest. There is also plenty of funny moments here as well.			",164,3,4,16,7,2,3

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway. ",136,15,4,14,14,2,10

												unfortunately it looks way cooler than it is. i swear to you, the screen shots are a trap. the game play here is bland and even more basic than something... idk, like fable. its really just click click click. i mean the fights with actual people do eventually get interesting but when fighting monsters,etc. you cant block. for some stupid reason they completely removed the dodge mechanic from the first game. Then theres the U.I. oh god is it bad, it feels like they spent more time trying to make something unique LOOKING instead of actual functioning. look, guys... just stay away from this. Its boring, it plays horribly. the only thing its got going for it is the decent graphics and art style. I mean it. Its the only thing this game has thats good.if youre not aware, these Risen game. They stem from a classic game series. Gothic. You want a game thats actually good, play gothic 2, sure it requires some community patches and work arounds to get working but thats just cause its age, it plays wonderfully. if youre a story fiend, than play the first one as well. If youre really a stickler for Risen. Just play the first one. an leave it there.edit: i know my time is only 1.7 and youre thinking how can i gather that much from that time. well, tbh, the game ran poorly on my computer, and I tried it on console and, while it looked worse. it played how it was ""supposed"" to. which is crap.

												I didn't listen to them. I didn't listen to those reviews saying that this game is bad. I had to play this.All i can say is this: this game gave me a hell of a journey. I duelled with pirates, soldiers of the inquisition and native warriors alike. I killed more rats and giant crabs than i can count. I possessed a native and attempted to speak in his native tongue to his peers (albeit very badly). All those hours i've spent into this game, it all leads to a duel with none other than the titan lord, Mara. In the end, i was rewarded with that nice little end game music that made the hair on the back of my neck stand on end. It kinda reminds me of Kai's work somehow, from the Gothic series.Sure, the plot might be lacking, the combat system feels more like a button mashing puzzle minigame which mostly relies on timing and the game itself is glitchy, i enjoyed it despite all that. If you're like me and you like the old Gothic series i'd say go ahead and play this game. Do not heed the bad reviews and most definitely do not listen to that silly excuse of a video by AngryJoe. They cant seem to enjoy the little rpg titles like this and Gothic just because the experience is rough in the beginning, if you know what i'm saying. A few flaws wont make this game bad, in my opinion. This title deserves to stand between the 1st Risen and Risen 3, even though it lacks a bit in a few areas.I guess i'll give it an 7/10Also, you can earn glory by killing rats, so that's a 1+			",162,21,5,19,9,1,16

												Summary: Save often if you bother trying to play this crap game.A foul, crappy sequel.Risen 1 was decent, showed promise.Decent story, wonderful graphics, well done sandboxing, modest combat. A bad quest log.Risen 2 they butchered everything.The graphics are spoiled by the over use of lens flare.The story basically takes what we know of Risen 1, and tells us it was nothing, meaningless, a dream.The sandboxing is done horribly - you're on a very crappy pair of rails, and good luck trying to move outside of them.Last and even worse, the quest system is abominable.I didn't think it was possible to make a worse quest log than Risen 1.They managed it in Risen 2.  Indefinate quests, poorly explained, no maps, no dots showing where to sortof head to.Oh, and the combat system sucks♥♥♥♥♥♥ Humans - crappy knock off of Risen 1 combat. Everything else?  special moves and pins and other BS that you can't deal with.Lastly, open world insta-kill traps. Da fuq? Why would you put insta-kill, invisble, unseeable traps out in the open world?In risen 1, you'll find insta kill traps flagged by cracked and damaged floor, or by vents. You may not notice, but after you reload you'll see it.In risen 2, you're stuck - anytime you walk anywhere in the open world, there's risk of getting insta-killed by a trap.

Product received for free
												Most Disappointing Sequel Ever. Should probably avoid it unless you really want to continue the story or just happen to see it on sale.Pros:- Hilarious Dialogue - Raiding houses, beating people up and stealing their stuff is so much fun - Ranged Weapons are more viable in combat than they were in Risen 1- Murdering NPCs was removed, however enemies will stay down after being beaten, until you leave the area or left-click while they are selected- NPCs stay offended for much less time after being robbed or defeatedCons:- Despite being funny, dialogue is still super cringy for most of the game - The plot from the previous game is very poorly continued, most of it is revealed from speaking to random NPCs and making certain dialogue choices later on; but some questions still have no answers- The A.I. of both NPCs and animals is dreadful and often make clumsy decisions- Factions are even less involved than the previous game- Characters have paper-thin personalities, especially the bad guys who appear for barely 5 minutes and proceed to die in the least dramatic way possible- There are now minigames, and one of them (Shooting Contest) is near impossible and if it's needed for a quest you're going to be reloading saves for a while- Optimisation is VERY BAD. Graphics are barely a step up from Risen 1, but if you have a low-end PC and experienced near zero lag on the first game; you're still likely to get frequent game freezes on this one- Looting NPCs after beating them up is no longer possible, thus removing plenty of quest alternatives that would have been possible in Risen 1			",38,1,0,2,4,0,3

												4/10This is below average. Here are some of the things I ran into with my experience with Risen 2: Sexist character writing.No, really, the first island you travel to with steelbeard as you hunt down Crow, the guard at the natives camp says something like ""You sound like woman. Women talk, men act!"" as he chastises you for talking too much after being accused of having hostile intentions as a pirate. He wasn't even written as a villain, just a regular passive-aggressive guard that you cannot kill or interact with beyond this. Broken Map Markers.When it came time to duel Slayne, I did not actually know where the blood square was which is where we had to duel. I checked my map, and the red objective marker simply lead me in front of the Admiral's house, when in fact Slayne was waiting for me a ways off to the side instead. This is but one of many examples where the map is flat out broken with some quests like here, and simply nonexistent with others. Another quest had required picking up multiple items, but the objective marker disappeared once you picked up just 1, so if you did not realize there were more to find in that area, and you cannot remember where it was, you wander aimlessly for a very long time, pulling your hair out. Idiotic Movement Mechanics.No, seriously, there is NO stamina bar, and rolling is by far a quicker means of on-foot travel than simple running. There was no sprint feature, even though npcs had the sprint ability which they occasionally used to catch up to my rolling being faster than their jogging. Why not just give the player that same ability!?Sloppy Level Design. Many, many, many many many times did I come across a stone staircase at a temple or tomb that did not actually connect properly with the stone floor at the end of the staircase, allowing players to see massive gaps into the game world void. This also happened a bit with terrain, such as at Garcia's Treasure hiding spot. Lazy Design.So becoming a ghost pirate is just you putting a filter over the player's screen, and changing a few detail models in the exact same environment, huh? Yeah, you disgust me Pirhanna Bytes. Also taking screenshots hard-crash the game to your desktop more than half the time based on how long you have been playing. It's unstable and sloppily coded. Vague/Stupid Quests.Certain story-required quests require the player to locate specific npcs to talk to, like normal. However, these npcs do not always show up on the map as an objective marker, and as the npc is only referred to by name, and some game areas have dozens of npcs, it's annoying to have to run around and check every single person's name just to find who you are supposed to talk to to continue the quest. Even worse, certain quest objectives themselves are just stupid. A gnome on Isle of Thieves wanted something only defined as ""round and black"", but there was no map marker to locate it. Again, this is a story-required quest. Round and black made me think bullet, cannon ball, bomb, lead pellet, or black pearl. Seeing as I had a black pearl on me, but no new dialogue showed up, I assumed it was something else. Little did I know, there was a hidden gnome in one of the caves that gave me a ""pitch-black pearl"". Each cave has only one bed, suggesting there is 1 cave per gnome, and there was already a gnome outside of this cave I had already talked to, which is why I ran all across the island for an hour and a half, checking every nook and cranny for another ""round and black thing"" instead of going inside. Are you serious? He didn't want a black pearl, he wanted a ""pitch-black pearl"" that can only be gotten from a concealed, non-map-marked npc? Yeah.... No.The list of problems do NOT stop there by any means. There are literally over a dozen other topics I could complain about and provide examples to but the review character count does not allow it, just trust me from the above citations from my experience, this is a garbage game that only people with low-standards and an abnormal admiration for RPG games should even bother with. It had a few moments which weren't really played up to their full potential, but even if they were, they would be far too few and far too far between to justify the passionless mistake that is this game. Risen 1 was a bit better, but not by too much. This was just desperate, stupid, rushed, sloppy, and an overall embarrassment of a product, which becomes blatantly clear when the customer really spends the hours to sink their teeth into it only to be greeted with a rancid waste of their time.

												After one ~15min session of the game I decided to give it another try. Game wouldn't start. I looked at google for answers and found out that people has the same problem during it's betatests. So, devs didn't fix it in few years.This is simple - I can't play a game for no reason, I can't give it any positive review.However, I can give one insight. In first Risen, we get the old Gothic-like world - fauna is really similar, with Saurians taking Orcs place. Everything looks the same - environment, characters, magic, weapons, pretty much everything. Now I get into the sequel, which looks very Pirates-Of-The-Carribean-esque. Everything looks different, starting with character, proceding with environtment, ending with weapons (no more heavy weapons? No more bows and crossbows, but with gunpowder weapons?). While it's not bad on it's own and might be fun, I really can't see it as something good after playing 1st game. It's just not the same world anymore. ",75,9,4,9,7,0,17

												This game is FULL of bugs, broken quests, and all kinds of stuff.  BUT the game works, no crashes, and nothing game breaking it seems.  With all the auto saves even if some quest broke completely there is no need to start over.  That said this game is Piratey goodness!  Outside of the bugs, the game is so much fun, great environments, so much dialog that is good, if its not good skip it, , dont like a cinematic SKIP IT, you can just review what was said in the journal so for speed gaming it works too.  Most devs FORCE players to watch cut scenes or listen to endless dialog even today, its nice this game gives us an option to skip it, but why bother, what people say is good.  There is a Gnome island in this game, a trip into the afterlife, voodoo hoodoo shamans, a wizard, many exotic species of animals to meet and kill, all in one game!!!  This game is a must play since so far there is yet to be any well good pirate games on PC.  Rating  9/10  Value:  14.99			",2655,1122,101,267,367,29,398

												I like pirates. If you know me, that probably goes without saying. *Ahem* Anyways, this is a hard game to recommend. I was hesitant to buy it myself. I also regretted my purchase at first, but Risen 2 grew on me. Heck, I even played through the DLC.Like PB's other games, Risen 2 can be hard, sometimes unfair, but if you like RPG's then it's pretty satisfying once you put some time into it. It's a decent RPG, so give the demo a chance if you're a fan of RPGs or pirates.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game started out as a big disappointment. I almost uninstalled after the first 30 minutes, but I'm glad I stuck with it! After playing for several hours the charms begin to reveal themselves, and the game's strengths and addictive qualities really start to shine through. Its weaknesses are fairly obvious from the beggining, and include poor graphics in some areas, particularly with NPC models. Other weaknesses include poor scripting, player-character immersion, and a general feeling of frustration due to unpolished content. There were a lot of great ideas not fully exploited. However, the RPG adventure with the pirate theme, with ships, crew, treasures, and some particularly hilarious gnomes, made this a worthy investment. After almost 62 hours of gameplay, I have not a single regret. Risen 2 is difficult to score. I'd have to give it a 7 out of 10 overall, but there are times during the game when you'll swear it deserves a 9. I'd recommend it to any RPG fan.			",164,23,2,24,13,2,32

												Starting out a journey as an undercover pirate and finishing it with your own crew and a ship, you can expect a lot of fun from this game. It doesn't go any near the grand epicness of games like The Witcher 2 or the like of it, but it certainly has a lot to offer. Be prepared for a regular Piranha Bytes like gameplay, as all that makes the game different from Gothic is the story and the setting. The game is definitely good looking and has some nice tunes to play to, but overall you wouldn't say it's an AAA quality product. In general, it feels like an indie RPG, different from other games (except PB games) and definitely with some fresh ideas and a good plot. Worth a shot, get it now if you simply like a good adventure or wait for a Steam sale if you have a better game in mind. If you spend a good deal exploring and get all the DLC, you'll find yourself in a 30 - 35 hour game with amazing atmosphere and sense of exploration.			",630,176,31,98,73,8,127

												ok well this game relies on two things to enjoy. One is patience the early part of the game is slow dull and due to the cool idiea of needing to buy skills to use them unforgiving. Your goal in the start is not going to be one of stop the evil it will be find all the stuff to steal to get money to get skills to steal more to then fight the giants. Second thing you need is to understand that the game is very much story run you are not going to be trown out to see it all from the word go like many games let you do now and if you try you will learn that the great pirate is very crap when dealing with savages and animals. But once it gets going it gets good. get the right skills and learn to manage your stuff and you will have fun. it does well with making you feel like a pirate as you go through. Now understand this is not Black Flag but it is good and if you can get through that first island you will have a lot of fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You struggle with the feeling of too much self-worth? You suffer from the nausea of being too happy with how things are going? You haven't thought of cutting of your nose for two days because life's just so great? This is it! The solution for all your ailments.That is to say the game itself is actually not that bad. If you liked the old Gothic games back in the day then let me tell you, the atmosphere is just the same. The problem is, Risen 2 is just horribly executed. And it has innumerable details that just make the pus in my abscesses boil with uncontrolled rage. It begins with no slots for auto- and quicksaves, which starts you of with 424 savegames more and three gigabytes hdd space less after 51 minutes, crosses over to an utterly ♥♥♥♥ed up combat system and leaves you with laughable animations. Now, I don't need no fancy graphics to enjoy me a nice slice of videogame since I'm blind anyway and only play by sound but if the running of your mighty pirate looks like he either has to♥♥♥♥♥♥like a hipster with an exploded bladder or has a wooden lower leg that has been glued to his knee with the pus from my abscesses than you cannot help but stare at it. All. The. ♥♥♥♥ing. Time.Also, it seems that some of the achievements are broken so if you're a chievo-♥♥♥♥♥ like me you get some extra ground for raging. It's a full service packet!I paid 7.50 bucks in the summer sale and that's 5 too much. I still play it though. Why? Because I felt rather good the last few days and I can't live with myself if I'm in such a state...			",281,150,6,66,23,0,58

												Played the whole Gothic series and Risen 1. Risen 2 is the only game of Pyranha Bytes that I dont like. The gameplay seems to have gotten worse since Risen 1. It feels like you're playing a very slow, boring game. The old games don't feel like fast RPG games, but these games are definetly more immersive. Risen 2 lacks to do so. It almost feels like a job to do the quests and play the game. If you have played earlier games of the series stay clear of this one.			",816,368,35,100,121,10,162

												It's buggy, the melee combat is a weak clickfest, about half of the achievements are flatout broken, and the natives rely on some borderline stereotypes.  I still whole-heartedly recommend this game.  It embraces its subject matter with glee, and allows a huge range of abilities open to your character, everything from pickpocket monkeys and rum brewing to voodoo curses and muskets.  This is just a joy to explore and see a wealth of hand-crafted goodness.			",360,146,7,69,31,2,49

												There are times when your life descends into turmoil and you are beset on all sides by First World Problems of the most trivial nature. In moments like these I like to take a deep breath and think to myself ""At least I'm not playing Risen 2 right now."" Honestly guy, if an encounter with a crab on the starting island is giving you that much grief perhaps a life of piratical adventure is not for you. Maybe if I'd given you this advice before deleting your insufferable game we would be in a different place right now, you and I. Perhaps we could have opened a little cafe in Puerto Pollo. I guess now we'll never know.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But the audio, the environments, the exploration and the writing combine to create a mega atmospheric whole. It does have its flaws but they only seem to add to the charm in the end. Strongly recommended for when you want to go on an enchanting caribbean adventure.			",373,161,13,64,42,6,90

												So medicore in everything like no passion was put in to the game. Way to hard. Long way into the game you still get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked by animals and generic pirates. All while you're supposed to be this super spy who defeated a titan but you suck at everything. Break people out of jail and save their lives and they will allow you to purchase skills at insane gold prices.Combat is one-clicking unless you (like me) has to dodge for 20 seconds until you can fire your pistol and hope to hit anything. I enjoyed Risen 1 because I thought the map was clever and I didn't know what to expect next in regards to the story. This is really not that interesting.			",94,14,0,11,1,0,4

Only negative to metion here is that it was a tad too easy on the normal level. Waiting for Risen 3 now  maybe the next istance will be another Gothic now the Piranha Bytes got the rights back.

												I really liked Risen 2.  When it was over, I wished there was more. I really liked the story, I liked the characters, and I loved the locations. Risen 1, on the other hand, was an ok time waster, but by the time it was over, I was really ready for it to be over (because I had gotten bored).  Get both if you can, but if I had to chose I would definitely recommend this game. Risen 2 is set in gorgeous island jungles that feel a lot more open they actually are, and there are a good number of islands you get to visit.  Early on you are allowed to fast travel so you don't have to keep running the same paths over and over - and OVER - again (like in Risen 1).  The pirate aspect of the game is only to get a ship for transport between locations and to hold your crew (you can chose between most of them for traveling/fighting companions when you leave the ship)...there are no sea battles.  It would have been great if there were, but they had no part of the story.There's a crafting system is based on the skills you decide to acquire and the recipes you find/pay for...you gather the materials as you play.  Money is really hard to come by in the beginning, frustratingly so...and every skill has to be bought.   I am not really thrilled with the skill system, most of the skills aren't as useful as they should be.  A number of them are really useful once or twice, but then you never need them again.  Others you want to max out as soon as possible...but you don't know which till the end of the game.  (or unless you look at a game guide)I am also not thrilled with the fighting system.  I ended up hack and slashing despite the fact I was also supposed to be able to parry and riposte...I don't know for sure that I ever managed to...I can't swear that they actually work.  I had the same problem in Risen 1 though.  I was never sure if I was doing it right, so quit trying after a while.  Have lots potions and grog on hand.  I lived and my opponents died though, so in the end it worked out.The game has faults but none that ever made me yell at the screen.  It was quite an enjoyable ride while it lasted.

												I greatly enjoyed the first game of the series, even though it had a few nasty progess-blocking quest bugs. So I was excited to play this pirate-filled sequel. But any virtues the game might have possessed were overshadowed by my feeling uncomfortable playing it. I couldn't enjoy the roleplaying experience soon after arriving at the Sword Coast, and just put the game down. If they were going for a level of social authenticity with the rampant racism, they definitely nailed it. Unfortunately I can't enjoy a roleplaying game where the protagonists are violently racist.The first instance that really surprised me was when you meet the governor of Tacarigua, an obviously corrupt and shady character. He requests you to bring him the heads of some escaped slaves. His character is further proven as he regards them as completely sub-human when you express doubt about his goals. ""Oh boy!"" I thought, ""I can't wait to side with these natives against this horrible governor!"" But no, not an option. This side quest has only one possible outcome: murder the escaped slaves for the governor.That was just one optional side-quest though, and I was enjoying the game play and other quests well enough, so I continued on with optimism that I could still be a good guy. Until the Sword Coast.Where we encountered some natives who'd allied with Crow's men. Not an optional part of the plot. And I don't expect every colored person in this white-dominated game to be a good guy, so natives I had to attack wasn't the problem. The problem was with what Patty said. The protagonist says, ""What does that mean?"" in response to one of the natives speaking a foreign language. To which Patty replies, ""It means first we kill the idiot that doesn't speak our language.""I was shocked and disappoitned at the racism coming from a major ally NPC. I realized then that these were protagonists I wasn't going to be able to enjoy playing, and I put the game down. It's a shame, because I enjoyed many other aspects of the game. But I don't recommend it for anyone who might share racial and sociopolitical sensitivities. The protagonists are just not worth rooting for.			",417,232,0,94,63,6,86

Fight other pirates, meet tha natives deep in the jungle, explore ancient temples. There are treasures to be found and theres Jaffar. Lots of gameplay for your money, interesting story, funny humour.

												Piranna Bytes as a company is one that I have always made a point of following.  Enjoyable, but tending to be overly buggy games at times.  Through their Gothic series, and then the split with their publisher then to the Risen series, they have consistently delivered a good product.  If their style of games is one that you like, then you will likely enjoy this game.As a sequel to the first Risen, the game presents itself in a much more fleshed out world than before.  Adopting the pirate theme that it seems most every game lately dips its toes into, you'll find yourself travelling from island to island while following the main quest line.  The combat is a bit shakey, the questing a bit wonky at times, and you can almost forget about getting every achievement the game offers (kill 20 ambient creatures?  Pretty sure I did that multiple times over) but in the end, the game was very enjoyable and well worth my time.One of the issues I tended to have with this is I would start the game, and get distracted, then come back to it and restart.  Did that multiple times.  But, this time I finally stuck with it and finished.  Overall, I was very happy with the experience, and hope that Risen 3, Titan Lords, will bring many of the same elements with improvements.			",370,116,6,82,87,2,66

												I am a RPG guy and enjoyed this game a lot. The storyline was great and not clearly preditactale, however some people may not like that's not classic medieval phantasy themed world. The usage of magic is limited to voodoo which was great for fun for me (especially controlling NPC's and making them to do what I needed) and there are pistols, muskets and throwing weapons instead of bows but it all stics together perfectly. Pirate theme at it's best.The graphic is phantastic and I enjoyed all the locations and islands. Sunrises and dawns are beatiful and very enjoyable. The nameless hero and important NPC's have a developed characters and can be pretty funny. Other NPC's are usually stationary and passive, which makes the atmosphere in cities a bit awkward. The fighting system is good, special moves are worthy of learning and using just the usage of pistol is sometimes a bit troublesome.It's worthy of playing and I am sure you'll have a good time. I had a very good time.			",3,0,0,6,1,0,1

												This is the only open world western-style-pirate-rpg that exists. It is a recommended buy for that thing alone. I compare it with Bound by Flame or Bioware rpg-s. The swashbuckling pirate atmosphere is pulled off perfectly with jungle settings, voodoo magic and mysterious forgotten temples full of monsters and traps. Which is the reason why you should buy this game - because of the atmosphere! You are free to roam the seas and interact with characters and on board your own ship and embark on sidequests or follow the be-the hero-and-save-the-world type main quest. The combat is bad, not terrible and takes a bit of patience to get around to, but this is offset by the perfect pirate atmosphere and pirete dialogue. I raised only social and non-combat skills through maybe 75% of the game and I had no problem getting through the rest. Besides being social, sneaking and piratting is what this game does well, so that is what you want to focus on, not the hokum combat. It is unique - buy it!:risen2skull:			",162,80,0,29,3,0,15

												I love the Risen games, probably because I’m primarily an Explorer, with a minor in Completionist.  In both Risen and Risen 2, you’re rewarded for exploring.  Quite often with actual loot, but in a more general sense with the same feeling you get when visiting a natural landmark or castle for the first time in real life.  I’m not saying the graphics are photorealistic (though Piranha Bytes’ use of lighting and sound does a lot to mask any deficiencies in the objects themselves), but what stands out to me is the world design.  So many game maps seem designed to fit the mission, but in Risen it feels as though a game was laid on top of a pre-existing world that follows natural laws of geology.  From the mountains and caves to the rivers and shores, the terrain feels natural instead of gamey.  I’ve played a lot of games where the design of a particular location was good enough for the memory of a specific location to stick with me -- but in other games I remember an interesting map, whereas in Risen my memory catalogues it as an interesting place.No Risen review would be complete without a mention of combat.  Yes, it’s darn tough at the beginning.  I mean really tough.  A pair of wild boars hardly considers you a danger when you first start out.  But if you are patient, make use of your companions, and admit that a low-level adventurer needs to run away sometimes, your power will grow over time to a point where only the most dreadful monsters are challenging.  The magic of this is that you actually get a sense of your character’s increasing talents.  And, unlike some games where a numeric increment is all you get when you level, in Risen you actually get new abilities as well as improving old ones.  By the time the end of the game nears, you’ll smile when you meet up with any pesky boars, and you’ll think, “Only two?”The Good:World design: terrain, light, sound, music.  The world builders are clearly familiar with geology and history.Exploration is rewarded.Actual sense of progression as your character gains experience.Wry sense of humour without being too adolescent.While the overall story isn’t terribly innovative, there were enough twists to keep it interesting.  The smaller NPC-related arcs were definitely above average.  I also found it interesting that they went for an adult rating solely based on dialogue, and not the more sensationalist paths of gore or nudity.Unlimited inventory space!  So nice not to have to micromanage bags.Treasure maps!  Who doesn’t like treasure maps?The Bad:A number of non-game-breaking bugs, like rain not appearing after loading a previous save, a companion getting stuck on a roof, or an ability not showing up as being learned in your skills display even though your character can perform that action.  NPCs with short memories: you can steal from them, defeat them in a fight, and a moment later they will still happily trade with you.  Also, some NPCs never sleep.  Really, never.Some abilities not explained well.Some instances where if you don’t do x before y, you can never do x again.  There was one NPC who was the only one who could train you in certain skills, but after you’ve reached a certain point in the story he won’t train you anymore and just talks about the final boss fight.One clue to treasure that made no sense outside the German version.[I feel I should note that my play time, which is only for a single playthrough, is a good deal longer than the minimum required to finish the game.  This is because when I visit a world that is this rich in detail, I don’t make my character run unless there is a reason he would do so in the game, and I don’t use quick travel unless there is a plot reason for it (e.g. magical crystals).  Risen 2 has very generous quick travel, but I preferred walking everywhere to soak in the lush scenery.]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, what a buggy and glitchy piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥I played?!Although I loved first part, the new ""Risen"" was not that bright for me, this is not the original Risen but something different with same hero and some NPCs.  Most of the ideas were not bad, dialogues were very interesting, but the hero is very weak, prices too high and there is litterly nothing to do into regions, than to just move along Pros:+ Great visual style and original athmosphere + Decent sound+ Story and storytelling+ Jokes+ Very own Parrot and a Monkey :D+ Really good but not original leveling up+ Guns are great+ Gonmes are great tooCons:- Very weak hero for more than a half of the game- Very slow game tempo, low stamina and running speed- No gold coins can be found when they are needed the most (treasure chests 60lvl with 15 gold coins in it?! Seriously!!!)- Health regeneration from plants is very slow and not effective with fast playstyle, lots of waiting to continue fight each 2 minutes- Voodoo?! Never heared of it- Most of achievements are glitchy and if you are crazy about it like me, than this game will kill your nerves (still can remember 2000 monsters killed in a single play without quitting even to the main menu).I guess this is what players call German RPG, although all the cons, I do recommend this game for RPG fans like me. Enjoy or at least try to.			",530,161,29,45,41,10,72

												I really wanted to like this game, but the combat is horrible with your character swinging his sword in random directions, and the commands and key presses given are not responded too until after they matter.  I do like the character upgrading in the game, being able to build your character however you want.  I would give this a 50% if I could, but instead, I have to give it a no.			",19,4,0,7,3,0,3

												Risen 2 is a great game. That's at least my opinon.You can try to skill yourslef as a blades, marksman, or cunning thieve pirate - that uses dirty tricks - or even a vodoo casting character.It has a great (Pirate) story and inbetween exploring the maps and fighting there is much to do. You can craft various staff, like blades, guns or potions. You can dig up treasure, solve sidequest...lots to do.Try to sneak into a house when the owner is asleep and rob him via minigame lockpicking a chest etc. Or even better use your monkey (if you trained that skill) to rob the place. There ar drinking contest or shooting minigames aswell!Granted its not as good as Risen I but i still enjoy the game.After hours of playing (i am not even into half the game) there is still plenty of content waiting.So you have to invest some time. I especially laughed my♥♥♥♥♥of when i first met the gnomes on the Isle of the thieves...but i won't spoiler the fun for you :)Combat is the only downside it is especially hard to do ripostes. It nevertheless is fun to offhand throw salt into the enemies face, or shoot him with a pistol etc.i give Risen 2 a 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is another oddball RPG, its fun and challenging, but it has quite a few minor bugs/glitches that will make you (hopefully) shake your head and laugh. Nothing is game breaking, but you can tell that the game didn't have a huge budget. That said, it will take you about 40 hours to complete if you do all the side quests and exploration. If you like challenging combat and a rewarding level up / progression system (and lots of pirates) this one should please you. Just don't bother paying more than $10 for it and the DLC :)			",334,79,4,54,25,2,45

												***I've edited this review after completing the game. See further *** markings below.As of being halfway through Risen 2, it is my opinion that while this game does have some minor to moderate issues that affect gameplay, there's still enough meat in the game to keep me playing.Weaknesses:Graphics performance: this game has optimization issues. By no means do I have a beast machine (3rd gen i7, Intel HD Graphics 4000, 8 GB RAM), but Saints Row IV runs faster for me than this game does; I've not had a moment of smooth movement for ~15 hours of gameplay, and that's on low graphic settings. I usually don't let graphics get in the way of my gaming, but for a 2012 game, I at least expect a decent frame rate if the graphics are going to be sub-par for its era.Camera and Mouse SensitivityI'm lumping these two together because Risen 2 makes a strange relationship between these two things. First, there is NO mouse sensitivity--your only option for what is a ridiculously high default camera movement speed is to lower that, but you're not out of the woods. Mouse sensitivity is really high for menus, dialogue, and some minigames. The mouse sensitivity is particularly an awful experience when in some minigames, like the shooting range; the only option you have to try and keep your sanity is to lower the game's difficulty to slow everything but your cursor down.PerspectiveThe player's perspective throughout the game is a touch annoying at times; you can never look up, and trying to line yourself up right to notice items on the ground, on tables, or next to sleeping NPCs that will murder you if you wake them can be an unreasonably frustrating part of this game.***Combat: This game's combat system is horrible. The game clearly tries to create a complex system for swordplay, but guess what? You won't be needing it, and you won't want to use it, either. Advanced swordplay techniques can't be used on monsters, so there's more than half of the enemies in the game you don't get to use that with, but there's an even bigger reason not to use swordplay: GUNS. Guns are SO OVERPOWERED that once you start, you'll never go back. A half decent rifle and pistol ensures victory over every enemy with a hit-and-run approach. It should not be up to the player to make the game more interesting for themselves--this game fails to make combat interesting.***Bugs and glitches: And here we are, the reason I came back to edit my review. The bugs and glitches in this game are the worst I've personally experienced. I should not need to worry about a boss disappearing while still holding loot I need. I should not have to use the in-game console to grant myself said item. There are so many little things here and there that are broken that the overall gaming experience drastically declines--you are playing a broken game, and it doesn't feel good after the time this game takes to complete.Strengths:***Difficulty: Technical issues aside, this game is actually difficult--until you get access to guns. I will congratulate this game for making difficulty a strength early game, but the game doesn't adapt to the weapons you later get access to--you'll eventually dominate everything because the game does nothing to challenge you further than it does from the start.Culture and humor: The pirate culture of Risen 2 is really entertaining. While the voice acting isn't always awesome, the content of what you hear usually sticks pretty true to what we think pirates said and did. The humor is also fairly rich for a game that doesn't seem to have the best writers ever; I caught myself laughing a tad uncontrollably once or twice. I'll give the game that much.Final say:This is a game that is close to doing many things right but leaves nothing polished. My first pass at this review happened halfway through the game, and now that I've finished it, I can confidently denounce this game. If you already have it, don't waste your time, and if you don't, don't buy it.			",94,13,2,25,22,0,25

												Tried really hard to like this game, especially after shelling out for it.. Unfortunately I can't really rate it as anythig better than somewhere between.. Mediocre and Decent. The controls are awkard and unresponsive and often quite frustrating. Combat is, at best, wonky. I frequently found attacks not really responding well, in addition to being unable to block/dodge effectively. There were also quite a few bugs I ran into while playing even earlier on, and the design seems a bit off. For example, spending a great deal of experience (glory) and guild to train lockpicking on the first part of the game, only to find three out of four locked chests required 90 skill, whereas I had only 20 (and the fourth chest still took 30, so). The voice acting is so so, not unbearable at least. Altogether, for the price, I cannot recommend this game. Biggest complaint is awkward and unresponsive controls, by far.			",216,47,0,74,1,0,17

												This is a pretty daft game, but it has heart and is a good RPG if you don't mind the stupid somewhat childish sense of humour.  Been playing for 26 hours or so, and there's a bit of diversity, plenty of exploration, but, boy does it take time to get skilled up.  I think i paid 14 quid for this, and I'm happy with my purchase. Don't expect an elder scrolls romp, or a assassins creed game though. It's more like Two Worlds Two. Good game, loads to do, loads to explore and steal. Decent loot, and I don't mind the combat system, though I've heard people slag it off. It's basic but it gets the job done. There's a god mode too if you need it. The hero is a bit of a knob head, so you'll most likely skip all the cutscenes to save punching a hole through your screen. I'd recommend this game even so.			",66,2,0,12,1,0,1

												Remember Risen 1? Remember all the voodoo? The british empire and the slaves? No? That's odd, since that is what the second game is full off. Remember how you needed that fancy monocle just to see the titans? Well ♥♥♥♥ that♥♥♥♥♥♥ they took that away so you can have an eyepatch... why? because you're a Pirate, Harry! Yeah remember Patty? That pirate you help in the first game? She got a hell of a lot more important... and more ♥♥♥♥♥y. damn you get tired of her fast...Bottom line - don't buy this game at full price. Not worth it. I haven't even started with the combat system - bottom mashing all the way - and I already feel like it was a waste. I hate how they turned the atmosphere from the first game into... this.

												Just completed it and for me it is a solid 8/10.The Story although not complex at all was  satisfying. I grew very fond of the two female characters Chani and Patty who accompany through the whole game.The game is at its best when it comes to exploring the gorgeous landscapes of the islands. If you like the pirate setting and being rewarded for exploring and figuring things out on your own the game is definately right for you!			",205,26,2,28,8,1,23

												At the beginning I must say that this game is not a good sequel for Risen 1.there are many changes. weaponry was reduced, magic was reduced. inventory is bad. whole UI is strange.combat is primitive. still can be fun to play.and the worst is what they did to the risen lore and story. they ignore things from Risen 1. titans are destroying whole world? who cares. we have some silly octopus lady and that is all that concerns you.Pros:+nice locations+exploration+soundtrack+some charactersCons:-story-quests-ship traveling-DLCs(content torn from original game)-changes in leveling system-combatoveral, this game is fun to play. who played any Gothic will be disapointed in my opinion, but still they will like this game in some way. (personaly I am sad for what happened to Risen) for some decent price it is worth to buy(not more than €10).			",50,5,5,7,1,0,2
