STAR WARS™ - Knights of the Old Republic™ – Adventure/RPG; Squad Tacticsa spoiler-free reviewRating: Recommended as EssentialYou wake up on a battle cruiser during an all-out firefight, find your way to the escape pods when it gets severely damaged, fight your way through enemy soldiers and crash-land on an unfamiliar planet. Knights of the Old Republic [KOTOR] takes place some 4,000 years before the events of A New Hope; Yoda, Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker are names of no consequence in the Star Wars universe. You are in completely new, unfamiliar territory here.Star Wars fan or not, KOTOR is a game that everyone should play. A companion system ahead of its time, multiple storylines, rich dialogue and backstory, YELLOW lightsabers and a unique tactical approach to combat allow this installment in the Star Wars series of games to really shine.- Companions -You will meet several unique, diverse characters in your travels; a few of them can join your party. Grab two party members of your choice and your main character and hit the streets (or dunes, or forests, or whatever). These characters come with set attributes and skills, but when they level up (yes, there is a leveling/experience system; this is an RPG), you control how they improve.- Story -No spoilers here, don’t worry. There are a multitude of side-quests to complete that complement the main quest, backstories to explore for each of your party members, fascinating lore on the origins of a few prominent species and multiple storylines. Depending on dialogue decisions, you can earn either Light Side or Dark Side points, determining the final path your story takes.- Cons -Not too many of note. I clipped through the floor a couple times. A number of seemingly random fatal crashes. This game was put out in 2003, so it’s a little behind the times in visuals and the cutscenes are really cheesy. The camera is a bit tricky to figure out at first. If you’re not expecting tactical battles (give orders rather than do battle yourself), it can be quite confusing. The biggest thing is that your companions will, at times, slow down or stop when you’re not looking for no reason, preventing you from entering the next area.The Bottom Line: None of these presents anything more than minor frustration; the game is well-built.Well, that’s all I have to say about KOTOR. An aged but timeless classic that any Star Wars fan (and quite a few non-Star Wars fans) will enjoy.Not RecommendedRecommended With CautionRecommendedHighly Recommended- Recommended as EssentialFun Facts:Developer: BioWare (Dragon Age: Origins, Baldur’s Gate, Mass Effect)Release Date: July 18th, 2003Soundtrack Composer: Jeremy Soule (The Elder Scrolls, Guild Wars 2, Total Annihilation)Prominent Voice Actors: Ethan Phillips (Star Trek: Voyager, Benson), Jennifer Hale (Mass Effect 3, Baldur’s Gate), Steve Blum (Wolverine and the X-Men, Metal Gear Solid)			",140,36,1,23,17,3,19

												I've put in way more hours into this game than Steam shows because I originally owned the actually discs (yes, physical discs) and later got the Steam version.  This is one of the greatest games ever.  An immersive storyline, interesting characters, great gameplay.  Despite its 2003 release date, and somewhat dated graphics, I still return to this game every so often to replay it.  Because of the branching story and different choices you can make (be evil, be good, kill this guy, steal this item, etc) each playthough is different.  I actually have a difficult time playing as an evil character because the game makes me feel bad about my decisions; very few games can do that!  There's also some funny moments, particularly anything that HK-47 says :)Make sure to get one of the widescreen hacks if you have a modern computer.			",107,12,2,3,12,1,12

This review is based on a purely vanilla playthrough+ Character creation allows stat customizations right from the get-go, and goes the extra mile by adding a 'recommended' button that offers balanced numbers based on class; useful feature for beginners+ Very even and agreeable pace throughout the entirety of the game; never felt too fast, slow, or interspersed with filler content+ Excellent, marvelous soundtrack; really keeps you in the game, and does well to make this title feel true to the franchise+ Mercifully short load times+ There are myriad available side-quests, all voiced+ Combat mechanics are well thought-out (despite 'dice-roll' RNG, of which I am not normally fond, as a general rule) and give you plenty of room for creativity and finesse+ Excellent story with lots of depth and freedom of choice+ While some characters remained a bit two-dimensional throughout the game, the majority of them are adequately fleshed-out and seem to develop to some extend+ The game includes a few optional minigames (eg. Pazaak Cards)+ Multiple endings, based entirely around the player's decisions+ Tons and tons of lore-friendly set-pieces and items (both practical and aesthetic)+ Extremely, alarmingly mod-friendly+ An absolute plethora of immersive dialogue options+ Boasts a few masterful plot twists- Poor camera; you get used to it, but it's initially quite frustrating and limited in functionality- Poor inventory system; throws everything into one long list as you accumulate items, leading to lots of monotonous scrolling when looking for equipment (mostly a problem for fellow hoarders, you could just sell all of your junk)- Mostly flat, uninspired voice-overs (some voice actors were of inordinately better quality, though that mostly served to highlight the disparity)- AI movement is mostly terrible, leading to waiting for characters to catch up, and lots of blocked doors/paths- Lots and lots of bugs and glitches; most notably terrain glitches and a few CTDs (some of this can be fixed with a small amount of modding, I'm told)- The autosave function is too sparse in functionality, and has led to some extremely frustrating momentsLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit ",195,26,1,22,22,0,22

												Before Mass Effect there was Knights of the Old Republic. Bioware, in 2003, decided to introduce a decision-making system which enabled you, the player, to align yourself with either the light or the dark side. Major plot decisions could be made and your gender could also yield different options during the conversations.This is one of the things one can like in KotOR. The two different alignments enable you to have at least two different playthroughs. But you have many side missions anyway. Even the companions can give you some. The world where the game takes place in shows us the previously unknown history of the Star Wars universe. A world that is 4,000 years before the films are taking place. You are awaken on a ship that is being attacked by Darth Malak. Your job is to escape, find companions, regroup and annihilate your archenemy. Of course, in the process you get to learn the Jedi way!Do note that the game is round-based. You pick the actions necessary (though this is limited each round) and you can even pause at certain points. You can also make a decision on behalf of your companions - the choice is really yours. What I have found out about the game later on is that it is based on Dungeons and Dragons rules. And the actions are calculated in accordance with these rules. As to how successfully the dice were rolled and what modifications were applied to the damages you are not told - but this is accessible from a menu.The game has excellent music (composed by Jeremy Soule), a long-lasting experience and, well, I wanted to say good graphics, but as the game has aged in the last 10 years or so, this is not really true anymore. Still, the art design is as Star Wars-esque as it can get and this being a Bioware RPG I highly recommend it. Not just for Star Wars fans or Bioware fans but to everybody wanting to have a good time!			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

												""Savior, conqueror, hero, villian. You are all of these things... and yet you are nothing. In the end, you belong to neither the light nor the darkness. You will forever stand alone.""(This review contains spoilers.)The original KOTOR has what I believe is the quintessential ""Star Wars experience"" out of all the franchise games released to date. Mixing the gold-standard Bioware gameplay and character arcs before they became overused and predictable, a focus on exploration and discovery, respect to the SW lore and a strong attention to world-building and detail, it's a game that still stands the test of time and is recommended for any fan of RPGs.As much as I'm a fan of KOTOR II's cerebral, relationship-driven, ""take every trope and turn it on its head"" gameplay, I still think the first game is the better of the two. The mystery of who you are, what your relationship is to the squadmates and enemies you meet in the world and how you grow to encompass that reputation again (whether for good or evil) still sticks out in the post-KOTOR world of cookie-cutter games like Bioware's own The Old Republic, which only has a superficial understanding of the choice and consequence that went into the former.The plot is fairly straightforward. You are an amnesic man (or woman) who wakes up aboard a starship, having been out for several days and coming to just as it is being attacked by the Sith. Narrowly escaping with pilot Carth Onasi, your pod crashlands on the city-world of Taris, where you begin investigating the circumstances that led to your foggy memory. Along the way, you'll pick up a starship (the Ebon Hawk) and meet crew members like the murder-happy HK-47 assassin droid, Jedi Masters Bastila Shan, Juhani and Jolee Bindo, Mandalorian soldier Canderous Ordo and Wookie renegade Zaalbar, among others. All this comes to a head as you uncover the true identity of the Sith leader Revan and assault a space station called the Star Forge in order to stop Darth Malak, the man who took up Revan's job and threatens to destroy the galaxy.This game has some of the most ""pure"" Star Wars moments I can think of. The moment when you first step out into the Dune Sea, and see that vista all around you and the smoldering Sandcrawler in the distance. The trek through to the lowest levels of Kashyykk and the civil war going on between the various Wookie factions. The underwater walks under Manaan. The reveal of Revan, backed by that epic score.While the player being Darth Revan is a plot twist that is firmly in ""It Was His Sled"" territory as far as spoilers go, it didn't diminish my enjoyment of the game one bit despite knowing about it long beforehand. There's so much content to see and do that it really felt like an enjoyable and fulfilling role-playing experience. Whether it's doing some of the sidequests (like getting involved in ruling family squabbles or doing assassination contracts) or just running through some of the areas, there's a wealth of material here for fans.It's true that the storyline wanes a bit by the end (not counting the potential Dark Side twists like convincing Zaalbar to kill Mission or the Bastila reveal), but it still didn't mar my enjoyment, mainly because I brought a pair of squadmates specced out for long-range combat (Canderous and Juhani) and went in guns-a-blazing in the Star Forge.The morality system can also be exploited to great effect (you can get to full Light Side or Dark Side in less than half of one playthrough), including doing things like maxing out your LS points than choosing Bastila's Dark Side option at the end to still remain ""neutral"" but get her as a squadmate for the Star Forge finale.If there's one thing I hated about the game, it's the inventory system. You WILL pick up a lot of vendor trash in this game, and I found it was far easier just to dump or never pick up most of the gear I found, sticking to one weapon until I found something significantly better.It's also much better to spec your character manually, because the auto-level system is nigh-useless and will often result in your character gaining abilities that either aren't class-specific or generally have no benefit to you.Regardless, KOTOR (and its sequel) still stand out among the best sci-fi RPG's in recent years, and the price point is a steal, regardless of whether it's on sale or not. If you haven't played it, you owe it to yourself to check this out.			",1970,825,79,262,266,29,338

 “A Long Time Ago, in a Galaxy Far, Far Away…” A war rages between The Republic and The Sith. ‘Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic’ throws you head first into a fantastic recreation of the Star Wars universe filled with lightsabers, Sith Lords, and political intrigue, in an immersive, gripping tale of Good vs. Evil which - more than a decade on - stands tall as one of the best RPG’s of its generation, and probably the finest gaming interpretation of the iconic Star Wars franchise.Campaign: Released in 2003 by Bioware | Lucas Arts, and set 4000 years before the events in ‘Star War’s - Episode 1: The Phantom Menace’, ‘SW:KOTOR’ tells the tale of a relative unknown caught up in events of cosmic proportions. The opening credits thrust you into the midst of an inter-galactic battle between Republic forces and a Dark Sith Lord, which finds you crash landing onto an alien planet, trying to stay alive and escape an inter-planetary Sith blockade. An unusually strong connection with the Force catapults the player from by-stander to protagonist, as an engaging, story-fueled campaign takes you across the galaxy from the mysterious water-world of Manaan, to the desert planet of Tatooine among many others. A lovingly crafted universe is filled with lots of recognizable faces to include – the treacherous Hutt’s, Bounty Hunter’s, Sith, Jedi Knights, Wookies, Protocol Droids, Rancor’s, and Sand People - amongst a broader cast of nearly 300 distinctive alien races.Gameplay | Graphics | Sound: A Third-Person RPG in the classic mold, gameplay in ‘SW:KOTOR’ is built around the 4 pillars of ‘Character Development and Customization’, ‘Inventory Management’, ‘Combat’, and ‘Dialogue-driven Story-Telling’. You choose to play as one of three character classes (Soldier, Scout or Scoundrel – with both male and female options available), and then as one of three Jedi sub-classes (Sentinel, Consular or Guardian). A deep inventory system allows you to customize and equip your character with a multitude of clothing, weapon and armor options as well as assign XP to level-up in a variety of areas from Attributes, Skills, Feats, and Force Powers. Combat is based around the ‘D20’ RPG rule-set popularized in ‘Dungeons and Dragons (D&D)’, and while round-based, players are able to queue up actions and run them simultaneously in real-time. Finally, Character interaction is via a dialogue menu that is rumored to contain over 2000 lines of text, clearly geared toward maximizing player choice across multiple playthrough’s. While the broad strokes are seemingly representative of standard RPG fare, three elements serve to distinguish this title from the rank and file – 1.  The ability to switch to | customize | play as any character in your group provides for great overall variety 2. The campaign is well-paced with ‘Third Person’ gameplay broken up by ‘Rail-shooting’, ‘Stealth’, ‘Racing’, and ‘Gambling’ mini-games and 3. Deep customization options, lots of side-quests and the sheer glee of roaming the Star Wars universe adds great replayability to this title. Sound Design is also particularly noteworthy, with voice-acting, sound effects and background score composition all top-shelf. Well optimized K&M controls round out a well polished title.Flaws: There is little to gripe about here, and perhaps the game’s biggest ‘flaw’ is its dated graphics - which have not aged particularly well - but it’s a testament to the overall strength of this title that it remains not only playable, but immensely engaging, despite this. Other minor issues include somewhat repetitive combat, and some minor character pathfinding issues.Overall, ‘Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic’ is an erstwhile classic from another time, rich in Star Wars lore, with a deep, engaging campaign, a fantastic background score, compelling combat mechanics, high replayability and filled with iconic characters, plot twists, and moral complexities. This is a title you could easily lose yourself in for 50-60 hours on a single-playthrough, and that’s even before player-choice dictates your ultimate path to the Light or Dark Side. The Force is all around you, Padawan. What is your Destiny? – Highly Recommended! – (Rating 9/10) Want More Recommendations?

												Alright, hands down my favorite Bioware rpg released ever. A great story that allows serious plot changing options such as killing off companions or finding out their individual personal stories. Great graphics for the time period and some of the most entertaining star wars lightsaber combat, beaten only by the Star Wars Jedi Knight series. Not to mention the STELLAR voice acting.With the recent announcement of EA purchasing the patent for KOTOR 3, this is a great item to pick up to get you into the realm of KOTOR.But how much could they have changed compared to the realm of star wars might you say? A but ton that's what.Ok to start with, the game takes place 4000 years before the movies and revolves around a wide spread jedi council. You are , (with as few spoilers as I can manage to describe this in) travelling across a set of 8 unique planets and locations where you can interact with tons of sidequests.One more entertaining sidequest (Non Main Story Spoilers) on Manaan where you act as a lawyer/detective and attempt to prove a man in court either innocent or guilty. Which winds up being a lot more fun than expected due to the depth of the investigation process and the trial interactions.However, I do have a few complaints about the game.First, the beginning sequence is AWFUL. The first time through it is entertaining to an extent, but if you want to start a fresh playthrough, you are often discouraged due to the length and lack of interest the beginning sequence holds. Once you are off Taris(the starting planet) however, the game's pace drastically improves. (Note: However there are mods to solve this issue should you find them necessary)Also, the main character is unvoiced, while it is kind of nice not having to hear one or two voices for all of your characters, the addition of voice and voice editor would have made the game that much better.Let's also not forget the utter lack of animations. Let's see, the game has about 5 death animations, 2 talking animations and very ugly running animation. Leading to a severe lack of depth visually.All other complaints I may think of are tiny things about the game that I take as a personal disliking based on taste, not anything that drastically affects the title. Overall, pick up this game if you like RPGs. You won't be disappointed in the slightest.			",118,20,5,21,28,0,28

												How come I didn't recommend this game yet? A real masterpiece, true milestone for its genre, KotOR is a crazy good RPG. Compelling story, good dialogues and a neat gameplay are the ingredients of a game that cannot be missed by any RPG aficionado. In my opinion, the best Star Wars game ever made and, even if it may seem a bold statement, way better than other (and more celebrated) Bioware RPGs (who said Dragon Age & Mass Effect?)

												-----------------------------[SPOILER FREE REVIEW]-----------------------------A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, but oddly familiar.Oh boy, this game. Bioware nailed it again.When I first played it when I was about 10 years old or so I didn't like the fighting system really. The game was available on four different CDs to install. I couldn't finish it back then because of bugged boss fight. Now, around march this year I began playing it and got super hooked and finished it the same month.IntroductionWhen you start you get to create your character with a set of heads different to both genders that you can choose, class, starting statistics and skills that you can hover over or smthng so it'll tell you what they are for, so while this could be overwhelming for some people it's explained well. You play as a soldier and start on Endar Spire cruiser. The action takes place ~4000 years before our canon Star Wars movies. You serve for the republic. You wake up and learn basic gameplay mechanics. Short Gameplay ReviewWell about the gameplay because I said I didn't enjoy fighting in this game when I was young: the game has an active pause and it kinda plays like a paper RPG with many different stats rolling your chance to hit a target etc. This can be considered a con if you want something like a Jedi Knight game but it works really well here and makes the gameplay strategic and all of your skill upgrades give you satisfaction when then help you win. You fight with up to 2 partners on your side at once and you can choose skills for them as well, just make sure to disable auto-promotion for them.You can play melee in this game from the start in the form of vibroblade. I don't want to spoil it to you so I'll just say that there are at least 4 different paths you can take in designing your character and only one of these is gunning people down. I'm not saying that gunning people down is empty and boring: there are also many abilities and weapons for that! When you play you'll understand because if you want to go melee you'll have to chose one of 3 paths.The World Here, Presented & Mass Effect ComparasionNow more about this world: Sith soldiers look dope af. Republic soldiers look authentic too. It doesn't look like episode 4 or anything, it's new and fresh but it fits Star Wars theme very well. The planets have quite a lot of story to them and you can talk to many NPCs and get many sidequests. Your choices have some consequence and you can gain light and dark side points depending on your actions. After finishing KOTOR I can safely say that this is the best Star Wars story ever told alongside Original Trilogy (ep. 4-6). Doesn't have none of the Death Star nonsense you and I already got bored of! The plot is very interesting and dialogues with your partners are 10/10. You can spend a lot of time talking to them and sometimes the game will prompt you that something is wrong with one of them and you should talk to them but it's not necessary, however this is the real icing on the cake. This game is kinda like Mass Effect and it's even made by the same guys: Bioware. If you want a good Star Wars story then definetely buy this! However, now let's go into some technical issues...The Rollercoaster of Emotions: Technical IssuesKnights of the Old Republic II got updated on Steam with new resolutions as far as I'm concerned and - workshop. This one on the other hand requires some outside programs for you to enjoy 1920x1080. Another problem is that cutscenes are prerendered videos that will not play in 1920x1080 res no matter what. It isn't a big issue unless they don't play for you at all... If you don't set up your mods correctly for higher res then it might disable cutscenes, and cutscenes have also some tendency of making setting up your resolution crash the game. After you figure it out though you can get around 50h out of this game in one playthrough.This isn't Republic Commando - this game is long.50 hours is a lot of game time for a game that is all gold. The begining can be a bit of a chore but when you get hooked you will sometimes play 4h straight! This game is such a classic...The Force is Strong in my EardrumsNow to music: it's not John Williams, there is some hints to him eg. Bastilla's Theme has some moments sounding like Force Theme. There is a lot of interesting music that you can chill out to in this game or get pumped up. As for graphics they are rather bad but they don't make the game any less enjoyable than if it had Battlefield graphics for me. This is same stuff as Mass Effect 1: it's old but it stands out because of the great, belivable world, your partners and the story in the game. Conclusion AKA Great Wall of Text, RecommendationsMy visit in this world was great and totally worth the time. The game's stuck in my head ever since March. I'm still waiting for a right time to begin playing the sequel. If you want a good Star Wars story then it's a must-play, if you love Mass Effect then it's a must-play, if you want to play a good RPG then it's a must-fu**ing-play. Don't make the mistake of spoiling yourself this story without first playing it, no need to watch other reviews. Wait for some discount, get it and try it out! If you want to then bother getting higher res with mods, if you don't then play full oldschool mode and swap your monitor with your old one that you still keep in the basement.LET'S SUMMARIZE:Graphics: Worse than Mass Effect 1 but they don't break the immersion or anything, the world is still very belivable and badass.Audio: Great voice acting, varied languages (as in: you get to listen to alien languages as well). Music is top notch.Gameplay: Strategic, if you like games with active pause system and paper RPGs you will love it. If you want a fast paced game then it's not for you. Skill upgrades give satisfaction and more than make up for the lack of Jedi Knight-like combat.Story & The World: Very belivable, you'll get hooked so hard! Best Star Wars story alongside Original Trilogy.Characters: Your partners have a ton of dialogues, a lot more and less scripted than Mass Effect. They're very varied and tell your their point of view on stuff, they'll argue with you but if they see that you have a point they will be sorry later on for being too aggressive. They are very human, as in they act like real, but they aren't all human.Skills, Upgrades, Equipment & Weapon Arsenal: More than a decent amount of weapons & upgrades, the progession system of skills and abilities is very cool! Lots of replay ability in this. Hell, you even get many different grenade types, mines, usables in form of adrenaline. Lots of different armour types that make all game styles viable, different headgears, belts, implants...Final Score, so if you like numbers...Overall the game would get a perfect 100/100 from me but it requires too much hussle to get working properely with AD 2016 standard of resolution and even X years ago when I played it as a little guy there were some bugs, and now there were some bugs too. A bit of odd gameplay decisions in some areas that don't work too well.The payoff however, is superb! This is a hard choice for me. From the perspective of playing this over half a year ago I want to give this game a perfect score but I remember that there was some negative things in it and I even pointed them out in the review. This game definetely deserves to be a part of the Canon.I'm gonna give it a score of 99/100. Might've increased the score slightly because of the nostalgia, but ffs: this game is so great now so imagine how great it was back when it was released in 2003! Don't get it spoiled to yourself by watching it on Youtube, IT'S DA*N WORTH PLAYING AND THAT'S IT! There is a reason why I bought it 2 times.			",172,19,3,21,19,4,24

												If you've never played this game I pity you as much as I'm excited for you. Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is the love-child of early Lucas Arts and Bioware (that should be an amazing sign right off the bat) released in 2003.  This game, widely and massively regarded as one of (if not THE) the best Star Wars games by the Star Wars fanbase, is absolutely notorious for its amazing storyline and characters. Set in an era over 3000 years before the events of the prequel movies, KOTOR is an experience which takes you back to a time where a threat greater than incompetent Stormtroopers and hordes of Battle Droids looms over the galaxy. Pros:----------A brand new Star Wars experience. KOTOR takes place in an era before any current Star Wars film. This leads to multiple things. The setting and theme is fresh and new, despite taking place in a setting far older than the Original, Prequel, or Sequel trilogy of Star Wars films. The conflict and enemies are new, widespread, and deadlier than ever. Despite taking place in ""the Old Republic"" the game is fresh and new in almost every way.Multiple hours of meaningful story. KOTORs story isn't something you simply walk through, it's something you grow and progress with. KOTORs story is an experience. You're not instantly the all-powerful Luke or Anakin Skywalker of the story. You progress instead. The game isn't something you simply rush through in 10 hours while destroying all in your path, its something that can take as long as 40-50 hours to get through. The flow of the story is perfect. It glides with you side-by-side. It never rushes ahead and it never falls behind. It's neither too fast nor is it too slow. Its pacing is great. Meaningful sidequests. One of my favourite things about KOTOR is how many sidequests are in the game. Now this might sound like a major negative to some, lots of sidequests usually means lots of useless, grindy, annoying tasks where you kill ____ amount of enemies and your only reward is some money and a pat on the back, but that's anything except the case with this game. One of the things KOTOR does best is how well it makes its sidequests matter. You won't ever find any sidequests to be repetitive or the same as the last. All sidequests are unique with their own characters, issues, rewards, backstory, and even consequences depending on how you play your cards. Some sidequests require certain things, some require certain companions. Some sidequests are as big as helping destroy hordes of enemies, while others are as simple as passing someone who needs help in the street or in a bar. All sidequests are unique and worth doing.Diverse, interesting, and lovable characters. Bioware is known for its ability to write amazing characters and KOTOR is prime example of that. From Humans to Twi'leks to Selkath to Droids, you'll find that KOTOR has interesting characters from a wide array of different backgrounds and species. All unique in their own ways. Unique combat system. I've heard multiple people compare KOTORs gameplay to D&D. KOTORs gameplay style is a combination of action and RPG fighting styles that make for interesting strategic combat. Planning, skill talents/abilities, items, and companions all play vital parts in KOTORs combat. While some dislike KOTORs combat system I'd say the majority of people enjoy it and find it refreshing. Different environments and enemies are also plentiful.Different Paths. KOTOR is a Role Playing game. This means you can be whoever you want to be. Want to be the guy who helps old ladies cross the streets? Go ahead. Want to be a hate-fueled fighter who'll fight anybody? Go ahead. Want to be a credit-loving vigilante who'll take up any form of work? Go right ahead. You can choose a wide array of options suited to who you'd like your character to be. Gives the game lots of replayability as well. Supports modding. Should you ever wish to spice KOTOR up on your next few playthroughs there are plenty of graphical and even a few story mods you can install for your game. Some mods even add new companions. While the KOTOR modding community isn't insanely massive there's always new ways to spice your game up.----------I've played through this game (as wells as KOTOR II) so many dozens of times I can't even remember what my first character looked like or what his name was. Both KOTOR games (as well as BFII and TFU) were basically my childhood, and are still massive parts of my love for Star Wars, the Old Republic era even being my favourite era in Star Wars to this day. I'll always recommend this game to people. You shouldn't consider yourself a ""true Star Wars fan"" until you've played through this game.If you thought Biowares Mass Effect series was the pinnacle of their RPG storytelling just wait until you play this game.Buy this game.

												People. You can call me crazy, stupid, insane, but you're looking at the greatest RPG ever made. Not only for it's time but even to present day this game is completely unique and unmatched by any other RPG aside from Fallout and Mass Effect. 100% of gamers won't regret this purchase. I rented this game in 2003 when I was 5, and play it too this day. Memories might make my post alittle biased, but I strongly stand by what I say.

												Are you a fan of Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale? Then this game is a must play. It's a classic Bioware RPG. Obviously, it's not Medieval style, but set in space and instead of magic you get the Force.PROS:- good, compelling plot- your ""band of misfits"" and team progression- variety of worlds to explore- ""detective"" quests- character development- background and enhancement of Star Wars lore- old school gameplay mechanics with pausable combat- lightsabers- graphics is oldish nowadays, but it's still coolMEH:- I believe the soundtrack doesn't try hard enough, it could be better, with more obvious themes for different planets- shopping is kind of optional, you can get by with items found on dead bodies and looted from chestsCONS:- pazaak gambling gets boring, Witcher made gambling much more interesting- some bugs, for example your companions frequently block your way or start the fight when you intend to just sneak byBefore playing KOTOR I wasn't a huge fan of Star Wars lore. Now I begin to like it all! The game gives you a lot of background and information on specific races, planets, history of the galaxy. It's definitely one of the best RPGs I've ever played!

												Star Wars: Knights of The Old Republic is a fantastic game. It really doesn't get better than this. The amazing Story, the fun gameplay, the likeable characters , everything seems to be perfect on this game. I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone that considers himself a Star Wars fan, and loves the Old Republic era. And after playing KOTOR, you should definitely give KOTOR 2 a try. (Sadly I doubt there would ever be a KOTOR 3)I have heard people having issues while running this game(specially in new hardware), but I can't really say anything about that. The game played normally on my computer, with no problems.			",34,1,0,0,1,0,1

												Knights of the Old Republic is not a game that would only satisfy Star Wars fans, nor should it be played by only them. It is one of the masterpieces of RPG genre. Whether you really know anything about Star Wars universe does not matter much. If you are a true follower of the genre, you should definitely play this game. This might also be your best ticket to get to know Star Wars universe.			",313,57,14,25,29,5,58

												So good! I was skeptical about the gameplay when I used to watch videos of this game but it works really well. You have 20 levels to rank up jedi powers, combat skills and feats (your starting class determines which of these 3 categories gets the most points per level up). A jedi power available is force lightning, a combat skill is something like flurry which increases your number of attacks but they deal less damage and might not hit and a feat is which type of armour you can wear or other passive benefits.Combat is played on a turn-based dice roll system which might sound off-putting but works out well. Throughout the game you will meet characters who join you on your spaceship and you may choose 2 of them to accompany you outside of the ship. Companions will have their own stats, gear and skills so you can play around this (if you come across a companion with high lockpicking you might choose not to level your own and swap to this companion to unlock things for you). You can choose to level up your companions skills manually or automatically. You can choose preset combat manoeuvres for yourself and companions such as ranged attacking or jedi support (buffs and heals) or you can choose to manually decide you and your parties actions by pausing the combat and assign attacks and items to a queue. You also don't have to use companions at all, you can elect to play in a solo mode where all the exp gained from enemies will go straight to your character. You also don't have to worry about this mode because companions will automatically be boosted to your level if you haven't used them.How you play the game is up to you. I went for a dual-lightsaber character with light armour and attack bonus jedi powers but you can play as a sniper, explosives expert, jedi caster or even unarmed fighting. The story is really what made the experience for me however. You will travel to multiple planets, gain your own starship, meet interesting characters and get to interact with almost every NPC you come across with multiple lines of dialogue and character development. One downside to this game is that you can't play in a widescreen resolution without using mods (although guides can be found for this on the forums here on steam, along with HD mods and many others).

-Quick Review-Knights of the Old Republic (Also known as: KOTOR) is an RPG that BioWare developed in 2003. KOTOR implements conversational dialogue where choices are made between different interactions the main character can make various ethical decisions, solve puzzles, provoke, chastise, forgive, extort, and more. -Detailed breakdown review- Story:  You are a crew member of a republic ship named the ""Endar Spire"", after creating your character you awaken to find that your ship is under siege from the Sith forces, you need to use your class-specific-skills to slice, pew, or sneak your way past the Sith troops.As you progress through the game there are probably HUNDREDS of sub-stories that you encounter, including 9 different characters with their own unique back stories. When it comes to story time, few do it as well as KOTOR.For my fellow Star Wars Junkies, this game takes places during the ""Old Republic"" era, not long after the Sith wars (or Jedi Civil War). The lore on this game is very good, you get to visit Kashyyk, Korriban, Tatooine, Yavin, Manaan, Dantooine, and a few more KOTOR specific planets.

 Game Play: This is the part where I stop praising the wonderful lore and story of the game... I have been replaying this game on steam, I had actually spend many hundreds of hours on this game when I was a kid... I had forgotten that the game is rather buggy, and your character gets stuck often.There are ways to get around the flaws (teleport back to your ship, or switch characters and run as someone else), but the inconvenience is VERY obnoxious. Others may not encounter these problems, but my point is the game hasn't aged very well at all.Bug's aside, the auto level up feature in the game is definitely suggested for beginners, however I was an idiot when I first played this game and would create characters who had skills they had no business in specking into. (For example; a soldier with high intelligence and focused on the persuasion skill)The Game play really doesn't get rolling until after you've escaped the Endar Spire and Taris, then you get to chose between having Jedi, Droids, or range fighters by your side. The strategies in the game really start to shine once you get into situations you cannot win with default combat alone. (For example; trying to get off Taris without leveling up the main character... I had to heavily rely on grenades) Something should be said for the detail and complexity of the combat system in the KOTOR series, if you don't want to learn how it works, just auto level up and you should be able to get through the story. (However, there are parts and fights that will elude you unless you get creative.)

 Achievements: There are no Steam achievements for  KOTOR, that doesn't mean there is no challenge or difficulty... Someday I'll need to try to speed run and/or try to see if I can beat it without my whole party wiping (game over). Price: Knights of the Old Republic is priced at $9.99 that's a pretty fair price for most RPG's. Since this game is rather old, I would recommend waiting for a 50-75% off sale, I got my copy from a Humble Bundle. (Humble bundle was like ""Heyyyy Atratzuuuuu, GiveUsYourMoney!"" and I exclaimed ""No! I'm trying to pay back college loans!"" And Humble bundle retorted with ""It's a Star Wars Bundle."" And then I threw my wallet at my monitor...)

 Conclusion: I cannot speak for everyone, but this has always been one of my most favorite Star Wars games, even with the various bugs while running the game, I still intend to play through the game at least once via steam.The game should easily take about 25-40 hours... depends on how easily you're side tracked... if you're a completionist like me you'll probably be looking closer to 50 hours, and then if you want to replay to help/screw the NPC's you screwed/helped, you can easily double your time spent.Let's put it in a simple pro's vs con's list:Cons: graphics are old, characters get stuck, not much aesthetic customization, combat is more complicated than it needs to be, cheap tactics to get you to replay the game, screen resolution limitations, and lastly Bastila Shan and Carth Onasi as main characters.Pros: HK-47 and Jolee Bindo... Trust me - they're awesome. Good story telling, skills/talents/stats are highly customizable, multiple endings and multiple endings to sub-stories, props for all the voice recording required for this game, and the appearance of familiar star wars themes/planets/factions.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update May 20, 2015:I recently turned on V-Sync in my graphic settings, and that has removed all ""getting stuck"" after combat and interactions. Which has already improved the game 100% (it's a pain switching characters, or saving and reloading to move again).Update September 17, 2015:Added screenshots to review.Here's the URL to see my review for  Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords ",141,13,3,13,8,0,23

												Awesome story that has multible endings; light/dark side endings.Very memorable characters, very good combat system.Good Moral choices; choose to help people in trouble with bounty hunters/ect, help the man/woman in trouble, accept bribe and walk away, or help then demand payment, dark side/light side actions, let people go or kill them, etc.Every decision you make affects the story and how the characters/world act and talk to you; light/dark side choices, killing off companions, choosing to help people or not changes things, etc.Great level up system; can choose between many force powers, and melee or ranged weapon atacks/passives, many stats to upgrade, etc.Very interactive companions; you get many companions as you play, what you do affects how they act and talk to you, some things you do before can affect if you even get some of them, you can talk to them and learn their history, and develop a mild romantic relationship with some of them, they fight and argue amongst themselves, etc.Good variety of weapons; rifles, pistols (can duel wield), swords (can duel wield), duel-blade swords, lightsabers (can duel wield), double-blades lightsabers, gernades, mines.Only complaint is the companions walk rather close to you at times and can trap you in a doorway, corner of a hallway, etc. ",36,2,1,14,9,0,11

												A true classic.+ Simple combat system that pretty much anyone should be able to enjoy.+ A good story with twists you wont see coming.+ Pizaak, because who needs a game when you can play a game within a game. It’s all about those credits baby!+ Decisions that effect the outcome of the game.+ Things can get dark!+ Good characters, good voice acting.+ Not a very hard game, I think anyone could enjoy it.All these are pretty minor annoyances:- Carth, just a whiny meat bag.- Dated graphics (hey it was originally release in 2003!)- Parts of the interface are a little confusing.- Minor graphical things, like on Windows 10 when a movie plays the window will minimize and you have to click to reopen it.TLDR;Save the republic and Jedi, or crush all your foes in one foul swoop. I’m not your mom, do what you want. Graphics are dated but the game is an instant classic and worthy of any RPGers time.			",55,10,0,29,5,0,6

												Best Star Wars game I've ever played, hands down. Graphics obviously a bit dated nowadays and there are a few bugs here and there depending on your OS; however, don't let this stop you from playing one of the best RPGs in the last decade!			",17,7,0,5,3,0,1

												Star Wars KOTOR is regarded as one of the best RPG games of all time. I admit, it's not as grand and open as The Elder Scrolls or Fallout. It's closer to that of Dragon Age. PROS:  The game is everything Star Wars It opens up a whole new area of lore, events, story, characters not seen in the movies It has a great RPG aspect, letting you choose your character, party, and slight storyline. The game lets you decide the fate of some quests & how your party members get along with you and others. A well-done karma system is also in place, letting you choose the light side or the dark side You have a fully customizable character build, you star with selecting your base class, but can place your attribute and skill points where you wish. Weapon usage is also your choice. Like blasters? Shoot some Sith. Swords? Slash some Sith. Lightsabers? SLice your foes with your badass laser stick!  LIGHTSABERS, who doesn't want one?![* Lightsabers are customisable with their crystals, changing stats and their colour. CONS:  Old graphics, but still looks beautiful. Could POSSIBLY get a texture mod somewhere. The game is also being fan remade (3rd and 1st person view) and will be available at some point. Nothing else, this game is near perfect.

												SInce this game has been out for close to 13 years now, I'd heard a lot about before I finally bought it. I love this game. While its age does show in the graphics and there are a few bugs because it wasn't meant to be played on current OS (which there are multiple easy solutions to) Knights of the Old Republic continues to shine through.The combat system is built like a D20 tabletop game with all the calculations done in a nano second.The gameplay, while not for everyone, I enjoy.And the part that everyone talks about, the story. Oh my goodness. The plot is spectacular and I wish that I hadn't spoiled it for myself. The story is honestly the best part of KotOR.So if you want the best Star wars experience, play Knights of the Old Republic. If you enjoy an amazing story with interesting characters and character devolopment, Play Knights of the Old Republic, If you just want to play a good RPG, play Knights of the Old Republic.This game does not disappoint.

Knights of the Old Republic is one of the greatest RPG Games ever developed. I highly recommend this to any Star Wars & RPG Fan.KOTOR is best played with K1 Restoration mod and Brotherhood of Shadow: Solomon's Revenge mod (both are compatible with each other).Pros+ Far better than SWTOR (also known as the game that killed Revan)+ Storyline is intense, revelations that will leave you speechless (unless you're stupid like me and decide to look at a Youtube playthrough and ruin the ending for yourself)+ Aside from the main storyline there are plenty of side quests you can do to keep you busy for hours+ The fate of the entire galaxy is placed in your hands, as you search for clues to the mysterious 'Star Forge' you can either help people or destroy them+ Excellent voice acting that fits perfectly into the storyCons- Game has the potential to crash at the most inconvenient times (happens less on the Steam Version)- No Achievements or Steam Trading Cards- Textures & Graphics are a bit dated, but thankfully there's a bunch of mods that aims to fix that- Camera in the Ebon Hawk is zoomed far too close to the character (There's a mod that fixes this)- Unlike in K2, you can't have much of a conversation with HK-47 or T3-M4My Rating: 10/10 (Recommended) ",89,5,0,7,3,0,5

												This is not only the game that got me into Bioware, but it might be my first RPG I actually tried to get good at and learn the mechanics of; setting the oath for my love of RPG's as a whole. It's not perfect and it can be argued if it aged well or not, but it's a lot of fun to play and has a great story if you let it suck you in.The game itself follows the tried and tested D&D rules like many Bioware games, with this game using a variation of 3rd/3.5 Edition rules; at least that's what it reminded me of. Put simpler; Dexterity for guns, Strength for melee. Feats add to abilities, skills and the like and force users essentially get a magic bar and the choice of powers every few levels. There's also the use of the ever present Dark side/Light side choice in Star Wars. This is mainly to affect opinions of your team mates in some conversations, but it also provides cheaper Force use for certain powers if they conincide with your alignment (Spamming Lightning never became easier!). It's nice simple, it works. There are a few useless powers and feats, but really, that's subjective on my part and there's probably someone out there for every combination.As for the atmosphere and world building, I won't go into too much detail. It's Bioware, by this point we all know that Bioware can excel at this. I will say though that by being set years before the movies, there's a nice chance to set up some new villains and situations that provide a nice background to everythgin; I'd say the whole story is a huge point in the games favour.Like I said though, the games not perfect. It's hard to ignore that the levels you visist are essentially successions of corridor after corridor. There's one path that reaches the end, sometimes you divert off it for secrets, but the apth is always there. The game tries to disuguise this, and I admit, it took me a while to catch on, but it's there, and hard to ignore once you notice. Not to mention, without spoiling it, the end game can feel a little sloggish with how it handles itself. It can be fun, but your first time, without expecting it, prepare for a lot of reloads.Still, despite all that, the game's a tonne of fun to play and I love to return to it once in a while. I'd easily say it's worth every penny and should be played by everyone at least once; wholeheartedly reccomended			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Playing on Windows 10 was an absolute nightmare.Outside maps (Kashyyyk, the Rakatan planet) were collapsing graphical hellscapes of static skies and stretched, hideous sprites. I'd have to CTRL-ALT-DEL just to kickstart the graphics. There was also a loading error 75% of the time. If it didn't load, I would have to close it out thought task manager, then go back in, CTRL-ALT-DEL to kickstart the graphics again, and attempt to load once more. Every cutscene minimized the game.All that aside, I played the entire game, start to finish. That says a lot about how awesome KOTOR is.			",129,29,3,22,6,0,11

The Best Star Wars RPG out there.   10/10 This is one of the best RPGs I've ever played. This is probably the best Star Wars game ever made, and anyone who likes RPGs or Star Wars should play it. Even today, despite its age, this game is still amazing. The graphics are dated sadly, but that shouldn't put anyone off.The overall storyline will mainly be the same, but everyone is likely to have their own experiences with this game. You get to choose your actions, and what your character says, and everything you do will guide you torwards the light or the dark side. There is so much satisfaction by the end of the game whether you choose one side or not, and the side that you do choose will affect the ending. The story is where the real experience is, there are so much likeable characters, there are side stories among the main stories that give yoiu more if you invest in them. The story also contains a lot of twists and shocking moments throughout.There is so much content to this game, examples of this are the main story, side missions,  Bounties, character backstories, swoop races, gambling and more. My playthrough of this game lasted about 30 hours, not completing every task.I loved the characters in this story, you have a powerful enemy, and come across a variety of colourful side characters in the storyline. You recruit unique characters into your team as you progress, a Jedi, a Chewbacca, an Assasin Droid, a Utility Droid, a Bounty Hunter, Alien species and more. You will need to choose which ones you are bringing with you on each mission, and sometimes that isn't easy.The combat was great, and enjoyable. I guess it can be a get easy when you're the correct level. You get to create your own Lightsaver which is fantastic, which can then be upgraded. I loved my Green Double Bladed Lightsaver. You equip weapons, and when enemies spot you, auto combat will begin, you can switch between controlling yourself and allies. As the combat occurs, you can choose a skill/attack for your characters turn. Its a mix of real time action with turned based combat.You can unlock force abilities, upgrade stats of your team members, purchase droid teammates upgrades, purchase armor/weapons for you and team members. There are a lot of different weapons for you to find, and set to your team members. There are a lot of options to play how you want.			",173,40,2,21,13,2,32

												Well, it has finally happened. After years of constant recommendations from friends and the broader community, I have played and completed what is considered to be the quintessential Star Wars game; a near unanimous masterpiece and supposedly one of the best role-playing games of all-time.Was it worth it? Did it live up to expectations? That big, blue thumbs-up should give you an idea.There is so much I would like to say about Knights of the Old Republic, but in such a small character limit. As already indicated by the thinly-veiled reviews, years of support and playthroughs beyond counting in more recent titles, BioWare is a developer I still continue to hold in high regard as a team that has delivered some unmatched personal favourites over the years and truly memorable experiences. Knowing next to nothing of KotOR and very little of Star Wars lore in general then, you can imagine the surprise of finding a video game that lives up to its enduring legacy and, even more so, the regret of not having played it sooner.  There will not be any spoilers or discussion of the narrative here, nor even a basic or general premise, suffice to say that it is that good - you should experience it for yourself.What I will say however is that to be more than twenty hours into the first playthrough and have such a massive plot twist hit - completely unforeseen and unexpected - is indicative of the level of quality that Knights of the Old Republic shows.Building on the classic formula of design and narrative that would later come to influence the likes of Mass Effect and Dragon Age Origins, the writing here is absolutely top-notch, as to be expected in a BioWare game. All the companions and party members are fleshed out and gradually present enthralling stories through a tonne of meaningful exposition... and romance, if you so desire. Reminiscent of the many hours spent in Origins, the pacing and strategic depth to combat is remarkable and lightsaber gameplay is some of the best out there. A definitive step between the design choices of both old and newer games, KotOR is heavily reliant on the many stats, factors and attributes that are running behind the scenes and a welcome reminder of the RPGs of yesteryear. Chaining abilities together is immensely entertaining, especially dark side powers, and carving through a group with lightsabers is just as good as it sounds.As overwhelming as the recommendation may be however, KotOR does have flaws. Tactics for the A.I. are decent enough but navigating and establishing a set of commands between enemies for a single character, (let alone an entire party), can often feel clunky and slow to respond. Invisible walls are aplenty, (common for games of the time), but you will also find yourself stuck on geometry a lot - visible or otherwise - and temporarily unable to move. But honestly, these really are insignificant when compared to the game overall and, while noticeable, are hardly a problem. I had no issues with running it on a more recent operating system, though this initial save game was of the base (and unmodded) game. (They are coming up next.)Also, if you have not designed or optimised your character class properly (or party, for that matter), it is likely that you will not enjoy the experience. As was already mentioned, KotOR is heavily reliant on traditional dice-based role-playing and stat factors. A wrong decision in levelling and feat allocation could be unforgiving, leaving you with the option of playing with the difficulty settings or tanking it with health kits and buffs. Play to your strengths and build the party around that or check out one of the many build guides if unsure.Knights of the Old Republic is more than worthy of the success and acclaim that it has earned over the years. A traditional epic in all sense of the word, the enduring BioWare phenomenon is definitely worth your time, regardless of your level of investment in the Star Wars universe.This really is a timeless classic and undoubtedly deserves a place in your library. Recommended, easily.			",132,20,0,20,4,1,3

												A Classic, an absolute classic. this PC port of an amazing Star Wars classic, does not disappoint. Knights of the Old Republic brings us the story of Revan and Malak, after their fall to the Dark Side. The story takes us to several familiar worlds, and gives us a little backstory on some of the species we've grown to love. Without giving any spoilers, I will say if you enjoy story-driven adventure and are a fan of the Star Wars universe, you will absolutely love the Knights of the Old Republic. Even though the graphics are a little dated, it is worth the time.			",479,176,24,74,66,6,86

												This will always remain my #1 game of all time, had it for the Xbox and loved it as a kid, now I have this version and the mobile version, both of which are great. It never gets old playing this each year. and I had no problem with running this game on Windows 10 64bit, as long as I didn't touch the resolution. I recommend this game to any rpg/Star Wars fan. This is BioWare's best game yet.This game is worth the $10, but on sale it goes for a few bucks if you don't wanna spend that much.Now consider this:BioWare owned by EAStar Wars game license in possession of EAPossible KOTOR 3 anyone?

General info~Genre: Role playing game~Number of players: 1~Star Wars related product~Completion time: 30-45 hours~High replay valueStrong points+Variety: Visit places with different geological maps, inhabitants, natural characteristics. Even the “tutorial” planet (Taris) is distinct from the others. You won't find repeatable patterns in this game. Each place has its own story to tell. My advice: Don't rush; take your time and explore.+Music score: A plethora of modern games advertise the “quality” of their music. Mostly it's just a marketing trick. Knights of the Old Republic (KotOR) is an exception. The developers put a lot of effort to capture their product's atmosphere in a music sheet. Example: 


YouTube™ Video: Star Wars: KOTOR Music- Manaan (Ahto City) 

			Views: 215,912		

			Music from the video game ""Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic"".		

+Story: “Memorable characters” is a cliché. Numerous titles brand the term in their case cover but only a few actually deserve it. KotOR does. Don't take my word for it. Just try the game and see if Juhani, Jolee or Canderous won't leave a mark on you. This will be a tale about partnership, trust, love, hatred, grief, revenge, anger, maturity, and reckoning.+Liberating experience: This is a game of more actions that words. Albeit a role playing game, KotOR pushes players to be responsible and pick their own path. Every character has a background and follows a moral code. Your protagonist's choices will reflect upon your companions in more than one ways. Aid them and they will aid you back. Betray their trust and see what happens in the course of the story. The game allows you to be whoever you want to.+Grey: Despite being a Star Wars game, KotOR isn't a monotony of light and dark side choices. You can pick grey as easily as you can pick black or white. In that aspect it surpasses even the films in some instances. Are the Jedi the just order and Sith their everlasting evil counterbalance? Are the terms good and bad viable in such context?+Micro-management: Pause the action anytime and give your commands to any member of your team. Sometimes, such management is the difference between success or… reloading the game. Just press “Space” (by default) during combat.+Working bench: Forge weapons, enhance armor efficiency and even craft your own lightsaber piece by piece.+Blend in: Not a Star Wars fan? No problem, neither am I. The story takes you 4,000 years before the events of the first film trilogy. You will meet individuals never seen before and you shall witness how certain groups became infamous in after years. Even if you have never heard of Star Wars before, you will still be able to enjoy the game to the fullest.+Living in the parallel: Fan of Star Wars? This game is for you. You will recognise many familiar patterns. Be alert though: Darth Vader and Darth Malak despite playing a similar role in the two stories they don't necessarily serve the same purpose.+Side questing: Tired of mundane sidequests which involve killing massive amount of weak enemies, fetching items from borings NPCs and ultimately rewarding the player with useless items and questionable currency? From saving a captive spy to playing the attorney for the shake of an old friend, KotOR will make you remember each completed side quest.+Narration: KotOR is one of those games that utilizes your imagination to some extent instead of showing you everything through a cut-scene or an FMV. Listen to your teammates stories, close your eyes and imagine being there with them; in their old tales of youth and inexperience. Gaming as it should be.+Price: Even if you can't wait for a sale, buying it at full price worths it.Weaknesses-Old school dice: KotOR utilizes some mechanics which younger gamers won't recognize or are too lazy to study them for a few hours, such as invisible dice and hidden statistical factors. As a result, if you don't plan your character carefully you might be unable to finish the game. It is advisable to consult some guides before starting a new game.-Graphical issues: This game might be unplayable in Windows 7 or later versions. One common solution is to turn off the grass on graphic options and disable movies. If that doesn't fix the issue (as it did for me on Windows 8.1) consult the helping and friendly community here on Steam.-Limited customization: Unfortunately, the only body part that you are given a choice to meddle with (at the character selection section) is the face; not even the head generally. NPCs suffer from the same banality as well.My rating4.5/5I'm not a Star Wars fan. Nevertheless, this game reminded me of how a proper title must be developed. Forget the flashy trailers and bright packages. This is gaming at its finest. After 20 years of gaming experience, I feel content to include this game amongst my favourites. ",73,26,0,11,5,0,2

												Alright to start off this review im going to say i thought this game was going to be full of bugs and crashes.... I was wrongNow this game does very well in every single rpg category for me amazing detailed story, Amazing combat, Great soundtrack/music/sounds and moreThis game had one single problem though when you start up the game and go to make your character when you finish the game will most likely crash.. Now to fix this you will need to go back into the game and go to settings then graphics then advanced... Now turn off FRAME BUFFERING this will stop the crashing from happening.Now i can say that the only con of this game is that you're now playing it right now. This is probably the best star wars game ever made and the fact that you're here reading my of course amazing review its triggering. Now please do us all a favor and yourself and go buy this game... All the negative reviews saying this game is buggy and crashes a lot has to do with their system and not yours. I really recommend to buy this right now because say you do have a few problems that cannot be fixed and they are really bugging you or make the game unplayable then just get a simple refund.Anyways thanks for reading my review and go have an amazing fun time with this gameP.S: I really recommend watching or reading some guides to get past some of the really hard parts in this game it will help you out a lot and save you a hole in your wall :D			",88,7,1,13,11,0,7

												The best Star Wars game - actually, the best Star Wars  anything since The Empire Strikes Back.Be wary of spoilers and dive right in. If you've ever played an hour or so of it and given up, go back to it. The beginning is a little slow but it's well worth your time, even over a decade later.			",194,70,4,33,26,4,27

												Kotor is a legendPros: -Great Story-Great ""Powers"" and ""Skills"" system-You can choose different paths that changes the story-Dark side/Light side choices-Its old, but its still VERY playable-You can play it over and over again, exploring choices and endings-Great companions(system) and voice actors-Its just a game you want to play-Long story with always new aspects to who you want to be.- Story- Story-Characters-i know the three pros over are the same as i have written b4, but !!!!! its awzm- It is being developed a new ""mod"", which is a total conversion called Apeiron. It looks amazing.- DARTH REVAN!!!Cons: -Outdated fighting system-A bit outdated graphics (BUT WHO CARES!)-Can be a little buggy in loading (stops, or crashes= CAN BE FIXED!)-Some cutscenes will crash the game(Can be fixed)This game is recommended for whoever loves a good story and fun gameplay. I have more than 100 hours on my old Xbox, not just the hours i have on steam. Win 10 may glitch the game up, but i managed to play it through with around 10 crashes in my latest playthough. I didnt use V-sync, changed some shadowing-systems and it worked fine.			",53,1,0,6,3,0,18

												I've probably logged at least a hundred hours on the original PC game (who knows where those discs are now) and the mobile port. This is more than just a piece of gaming history. This is possibly the best Star Wars game ever made. If you are a fan of Star Wars and RPGs then you will love this game. If you don't know the story already then don't spoil it for yourself! To truly get the full game experience, you will likely want to play through at least twice, once as a good guy and once as a bad guy.While it was impressive and considered groundbreaking for its time, I would stand it next to many modern AAA games. It is definitely a game that has stood the test of time, as many others have said.It's an absolute steal if you manage to snag it on sale price but I had no hesitation paying the full price for the mobile port.If you have issues running it, you may need to tweak some settings using swconfig.exe in the Steam install folder. As of yet, I haven't had any issues on Windows 10 although I have heard other users have.			",244,42,4,39,10,1,28

												One of the best games I've ever played. Seriously.Skip to the bottom if you want a TL;DR.According to Steam I've only played 23 hours' worth – that's not true. I've always had weird problems with the whole connection with Steam – one day it'll say I've played 31 hours, the next it'll say I've only played 7. I am pretty sure I've logged over 40 hours of gameplay on this.Not much, when you compare it to other people's times. But I'm not a hardcore gamer. I game when I have some spare time.This game is seriously good.Sure, the combat is a bit odd and clunky, especially if you're used to modern games or if you don't role-play, but give it a bit and it'll feel natural. I actually prefer it.The story is gripping, the characters well-developed.It really does it's job in inserting you into the Star Wars universe, and story wise I have no complaints.One complaint I do have is the length of time you spend running around. It's at least seventy percent of the game. And for some reason it just feels like a real drag.TL;DR?Excellent game, story is brilliant, role-play-style combat system, too much running around.

												Out of curiosity I did a little search for the best RPG’s of all time and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (KotOR) popped up time and time again for being the best Star Wars game ever made, period. I’m a Star Wars fan, but this game came out in 2003, that makes it 13 years old!I did a google on running KotOR on Windows 10 and quite a few people had succeeded in getting it to work (though many couldn’t even get past the loading screen). I pulled the trigger on the game, and had no issues getting it to run on my new PC (it’s only crashed once and sometimes the audio stops but a quit and reload fixes that). It’s so old school the video cut scenes are tiny 640 x 480 vids! I can’t use the controller so I have to use the keyboard and mouse.Loving the story so far! Love it that old school games make you work for it; I didn’t get a lightsaber until at least 3-4 hours into the game! Gameplay is super old school, but the fact that it is adds to the charm. I usually hate music in games (I always turn it off), but this is Star Wars, and the soundtrack, as well as SFX blasting out of my bass heavy surround system really does make the game feel more current and immersive.

												Great game.  So much nostalgia from my childhood.  Been needing a change from playing Kerbal Space Program and Age of Empires all the time, so I finally decided to play this game again.  Was sad to find out upon launching the game...INSTABILITY ON WINDOWS 10 (I found a solution; keep reading)!!!  The game allowed me to select new game and create a character, but as soon as I launched the gameplay, it would instantly crash.Was able to get the game to work though.  Hope this helps someone:My solution:1.  Go to the game directory for KOTOR (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\swkotor)...for most people; exceptions for example, all my games are saved to HHD on drive F.  Right click on the executable for the game (.exe file) and select Properties.  Go to the Compatibility tab, and check the box which says ""Run this program in compatibility mode for:"".  I selected Windows 8 from the drop down menu; if you finish these procedures and it still doesn't work, stry Vista or XP (The Windows 10 instability seems to also affect Windows 7).  Hit OK.3.  Once in game, got to Options and then Graphics.  Deselect Shadows and Grass.  I chose to run the game in 1024 x 768 at 75 Hz refresh for screen resolution (1280 x 1024 was just too small for me).4. Select Advanced Options.  The setting on this page that seemed to make the game crash on me was Frame Buffer Effects.  Deselect this.  I was able to run at High graphics, 8 sample AA (Anti-aliasing), Anisotropy at 16%, and enable V-sunc.These are all the changes I made.  The game appeared stable for the intro scenario and didn't crash.  I will update if this changes as I play farther into the game.Another recommendation I had been given was editing the .ini file to run in windowed instead of full screen mode, but I didn't have to do this to get the game stable (I think) but it's something to keep in mind if your mileage varies from mine.Just in case, here are the instructions I was given for windowed mode:1. Go to swkotor.ini file and open it with Notepad (or Notepad++, etc). This should be located in the game directory.2a. Locate the following line: Fullscreen=1  b. and change it to: Fullscreen=0.3. In the [Graphic Options] section add the following line: AllowWindowedMode=14. Save the file and exit.5. Launch game from directory .exe.  Launching through steam client or steam desktop shortcut will revert changes to this file.Good luck!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												By far one of the best RPG games i have played. At first the battle style was very different from what i am used to, but as I progressed farther into the game and i understood it more and the story became more developed I started to really like the battle system. It can either be a faster paced or step by step battle. Also, this game has one of the best storylines i have ever played and the interactive part and choosing light or dark side really made this game what it is. If you are considering buying this game, don't hesitate, just do it.			",122,11,0,16,5,0,12

												This is one of the greatest adventure/rpg games of our time, possibly the best star wars game of all time. With relatable and interesting characters, difficult story-line descisions, easter eggs, and loads of replayablity, this game is a classic masterpiece, and in my opinion, the most interesting star wars story ever told. Unfortunately, it's not timeless, as the graphics and controls definitely don't stand up to anything released in the last 5 years. If you can look past the less-than-average controls and graphics, you have a D&D style adventure/puzzle/rpg game that will absolutely blow you away.			",37,11,0,12,14,3,3

												A truly amazing game. I originally had this game for the Xbox way back when it was first released. I never really played it that much, although I did complete it and so when I came back to it as I was older, I had vivid memories and details that made the game seem more enjoyable. Every playthrough is amazing, and surprisingly never gets boring. The plot is amazing, although sometimes predictable, and each character has their own background story to do on the side. You can progress with each member and learn of their past and what they want now. With the character story progression, you cna find that 4 or 5 of them will let you into dark or secret parts of their lives that let you venture out and help them cut ties, deal with loose ends or help them find peace. The only downside to this is that you cannot do every party member's side stories, only those you progress well with first.The games engine is out-of-date, however it doesn't take out any value from the many, many play throughs of the game I have completed. The game is simple, yet captivating, and each playthrough is just as good as the last. With the ability to add mods, textures, story-lines and unreleased content, you can be sure to find something new to explore or give yourself a new perspective to enjoy. I could honestly write so much about this game, but there is too much. I can just never play the game without finding everything; doing all of the sidequests, talking and exploring. It's old, it shows little age, and it'll always be one of my favourite Star Wars games of all time!			",154,22,7,17,13,2,15

												This is a great classic star wars game.There are 3 different classes with different skills and abilities.You better google search for more details on that, might be a little too complex for this review.For example, in certain situations, depending on your abilities, you might be able to intimidate or pursuade people, repair or hack some machinery to help you out, unlock certain doors and containers.There are blasters, melee weapons (swords and lightsabers) and different grenades to use in combat.Aside from that, there is also a variety of force powers you can use, though you have to unlock those abilities with skill points first.Combat is turn based and pausable, so you can plan out fights pretty well.You can switch between your main character and his companions (if you have any) and control their actions in battle - Or you just let the game do it for you.Companions level up as well, and you can upgrade their skills accordingly.Might wanna check some gameplay on youtube if you wanna see what it's exactly like.A lot of times in the game you have to make decisions, which either give you light side or dark side points. This also has an impact on how people react towards you.(Just a heads up: Being a good guy is way more tiresome and expensive. Just kill everyone.)The game runs perfectly for me on Windows 8.1 Professional 64 bit, the only little annoying bug I had fixed itself when turning on V-Sync, though I can't guarantee. Some people have reported problems. You should check out the community hub for that.Any more questions? Feel free to leave a comment.			",279,14,37,22,14,4,21

												One of the best Star Wars experiences you could ever have. Knights of the old Republic is an RPG that was made to be on computers. Its controls may seem archaic now but they were a massive step above the original Xbox release. As an RPG there's a lot of depth not only in mechanics but decision making as well. Two of the games strongest features are open ended but linear levels and its moral system. Kotor is a linear game, but it hides this so well through its level design. Each place you travel too feels like its own small world, full of quests and characters to meet. You can spend hours exploring each one of them. The moral system adds weight to your choices and the direction of the story. Other characters in your team may even be influenced by your decisions and affects what force powers you can equip. Its a fantastic game, which admitedly falls apart near the end. Difficulty spikes in the final area end up creating a frustrating experience rather than a fulfilling one. But the journey there is more than worth it. Its one of the great PC classics and as a star wars fan or as a newcomer you can't go wrong here.			",388,95,9,67,29,5,24

												Star Wars Knights Of The Old Republic ReviewIntro. Star Wars Knights Of The Old Republic or KOTOR for short is a classic video game. It is one of Bioware's first RPG it is a very popular game from 2003. This game is the precursor to Bioware's Mass Effect and Dragon Age games.  Pros 1 Star Wars KOTOR is a great roleplaying game with a great story that is comparable to the quality of the starwars movies. It has a very interesting plot with a very imersive world, well written characters, is true to Star Wars lore and is a joy to play through multiple times for the story alone. 2 The gameplay in the game is very fun your decisions in the game have benefits and negative if you decide to follow the dark side or the light side of the force. There are often many different outcomes to a quest, adding more to the replay value. The games combat is similar to dungeons and dragons with attack damage calculated like a dice role, so how much damage you do can depend on luck making the game more challenging. There are also many mini games throughout the story adding variety such as swoop racing, space fights, card games, arena battles and riddles just to name a few. The game does not feel repetitive with all the extra mini games. 3 The mods for this game are wonderfully done there are well over 1000 mods for KOTOR including, KOTOR 1 restoration mod, yavin IV planet mod, Solomon revenge the brotherhood of shadow, and many many more mods. There are many mods that fix parts of the game you may not like mods adding content mods fixing bugs, and mods restoring lost content. Some of the fan mods even have voice acting, 3D textures, dialogue and extra stories that are higher quality than the content in the game. Most KOTOR mods come with a TSL patcher that makes installing and uninstalling them very simple just run the installer to install the mod. Cons 1 A rule is said about KOTOR and that is that it's impossible to run KOTOR without the game crashing on you at least once. The game even crashes in speed runs. The game is really buggy and unfortunately many of the wonderful mods don't help how the game can crash during cutscenes, movies, loading screens and such. The game can be fixed to run well even on modern systems. I have played through the game on windows 10 both the steam and disk version and it had some issues but I was able to beat the game with only a few crashes. The community support to fix any issues you might have is very good but there are many problems in KOTOR due to the game running in a awful engine. Despite you likely having to change game settings a few times and it crashing on you a few times I still recommend the game. If you want a game just like this that is more stable and crashes less try KOTOR the sith lords 2, but I am one of those people who think KOTOR 1 is  better.2 The game is very old and does not look very good. The game looks like a ps2 era game and is quite dated by today's standards. There are many mods that improve the graphics of the game, there are mods the redo most of the textures in the game even texture mods that fix the textures of mod content so if you don't mind installing a few texture mods you can improve the look of the game Its effects animations sounds and much more. The game even with all of the setting cranked all the way up and with all the texture mods the game looks much better but still looks dated but it doest look like its 10 years old if you mod it. 3 KOTOR had some issues with the game being rushed and it having cut content. KOTOR the sith lords had this issue too but that game at least had a new steam update that officially added that mod content into the game, adding controller support, and improving the games performance. Sadly KOTOR 1 does not have these improvements but some day it may get such improvements. The game feels well made in a few areas but empty in other parts of the game. You will want to mod the game to get more content because the old KOTOR series 1&2 had development issues.Thoughts Kotor 1 is a classic and a excellent game despite these issues. if you want a more stable game I would recommend you try KOTOR 2 but I personally found KOTOR 1 much more fun as i have beaten the game multiple times while I liked KOTOR 2 but I could never enjoy it enough to play it through. I think KOTOR 1 had better sound was more imersive as a story, was more fun, and it has more mods than KOTOR 2. The best way to describe this is if mass effect or dragon age was a Star Wars game but older. The game was the first bioware game to have the first ""romance scene"" ;) To ConcludeDo I recommend you buy this game? Yes I do recommend this to anyone who wants a fun game with a great story, TONS of awesome mod content, a game that immersises you in the starwars universe like no other game I have ever played and is really fun and has great replay value. If you consider mod content to the game it has enough replay value to play the game over 12 times playing each class each difficulty, each mod that is incompatible with other mods and playing different decisions. The game is unstable and will crash on you at least once but I found the steam version to crash less than my disk version of the game. I recommend that you buy the game and see all the wonderful mod content, the great story and get immersed  into the world of starwars in a story as good or better than the starwars movies.

												Wo fang ich an .. ?Als ich SW:KotoR zum ersten Mal auf der Xbox Classic gespielt hab, war ich ca. 10 Jahre alt.Ich hab das Spiel damals immer und immer wieder durch gespielt ! Nach ca 10 Jahren sah ich das die Star Wars Collection im Angebot ist und hab natürlich zugeschlagen. In dieser Box war zu meinem Glück SW:KotoR 1 & 2 dabei und dachte mir sofort das ich sie unbedingt wieder spielen muss !SW:KotoR 1 ist damals wie heute einfach ein RPG MEILENSTEIN, das Spiel hat eine wirklich sehr gut geschriebene Story die ein jedesmal von neuem fesselt egal wie oft man das Spiel durchspielt. Nach jedem Playthrough finde ich immer wieder Quests und Dialoge die ich noch nie gesehen hab. So jetzt noch eine kurze erklärung vom Spielverlauf: Man erstellt sich am Anfang vom Spiel ein Charackter. Man wählt die Klasse aus verteilt paar Talentpunkte, bestätigt und es folgt Star Wars typisch ein kleines Intro die, die Handlung vom Spiel kurz erklärt. Man startet auf einem Raumschiff das sozusagen als Tutoriallevel funktioniert, in dennen die Spielemechaniken erklärt werden. Die Kämpfe sind Rundenbasiert wärend man sich auf Nah- oder Fernkampf spezialisieren kann. Dabei wird man immer mit 2 weiteren Charackteren begleitet die man im Verlauf des Spieles findet. In dem Spiel gibt es eine Gut-Böse Mechanik, sprich alles was man tut oder nicht tut hat Folgen auf den Verlauf des Spieles.Nun folgt noch eine kleine Warnung:Das Spiel ist frustrierend verbuggt auf Windows 7, ohne gewisse Einstellung und Fixes die man sich aus dem Internet zieht crasht das Spiel fast nach jedem neuen Level (Planet).Deswegen möchte ich noch einmal einige Tipps mitgeben die mir beim spielen geholfen haben: - Im SW:KotoR Ordner gibt es eine Datei die ""seconfig.exe"" heißt, dort müsst ihr unbedingt die Hardware-Maus deaktivieren.Wenn bei euch das Spiel crasht wenn eigentlich eine Video abspielen sollte, müsst ihr leider die Videos deaktivieren.- Im selben Ordner gibt es eine Datei die sich ""swkotor.ini"" nennt dort geht ihr unter ""[Graphics Options]"" und stellt ""FullScreen=1"" auf ""FullScreen=0"". Ausserdem fügt ihr ""AllowWindowedMode=1"" in der untersten Zeile von [Graphics Options] ein. Diese aktiviert den Fenster Modus des Spieles, da es im Fenstermodus weitaus stabiler läuft.- Hier nochmal ein Video auf Englisch der das hier alles nochmal erklärt + einem Fix zum downloaden :

- Das alles fixt jedoch nicht eines der nervigsten Bugs im Spiel: nach einem Kampf kommt es vor das der Charackter sich nicht mehr bewegen kann. Das liegt daran der er noch im Angriffsmous steckt obwohl keine Gegner in der nähe sind. Was dagegen hilft:* Wenn du Glück hast ist noch ein Gegner in der Nähe die diesen Bug beheben können.* Manchmal hilft es einfach mit einem Bgleiter kurz zu reden.* Aber am effektivsten ist es einach zu speichern un neu zu laden.Das sind wirklich die einzigen Bugs die man merkt und wer über sie hinwegsehen kann, dem erwartet ein grandioses Rollenspiel der bis zu 40 Stunden pro Spieldurchlauf fesselt.

												Knights of the Old Republic is one of the best games I have ever played. Bioware did a great job with character design and creating an extremely high quality story. The game takes place many years before the events of the Star Wars films during the ""Old Republic"" period. The characters you meet and places you explore are very well done and I could argue that this game is Bioware's best work.If you are a fan of Star Wars or just like a well crafted RPG game, I highly recommend STAR WARS™ - Knights of the Old Republic™			",106,5,0,13,10,0,33

												If you are a fan of Star Wars then this is the game for you. Star Wars Knight Of The Old Republic is a role playing game with combat based off the D20 system which allows more strategy over other hack & slash rpgs. With a great story & compleing characters you will be immersed for the full  thirty to forty hours of gameplay. I can't recommend this game more it is a true video game classic & one of the best Star Wars video games ever made. It is truly well worth the money & your time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I just finished this wonderful title today, and it's hard not to be over excited and exaggerate on my review, but I must say; it's a gem. The Star Wars universe feels alive and welcoming in this game, complemented by solid RPG mechanics and an amazing story. Sure the graphics are outdated, but that shouldn’t discourage you from diving into this game. As a GM and amateur game designer, I’ve learned valuable lessons in character progression, level design and overall plot development.If you enjoy RPGs and never played this game, do yourself a favor and buy it. I should also say that the combat isn’t very intuitive, rather more tailored towards strategy, but that’s not a bad thing. I found myself often pausing the game to analyze my surroundings and make the best decisions I could.The game is based on the D&D 3.0 ruleset and it brought me nostalgic tears of joy to have that system powering my journey. One thing I wish was better implemented though, was the Light and Dark balance and point acquisition. I felt like we needed more meaningful choices and moral ambiguities to spice things up, but that might as well be just my personal taste.I haven’t played the sequel yet, but I plan to. I’m now hoping for a third game, with updated graphics and no compromise on mechanics and storytelling. ",36,22,0,15,1,0,5

												I recommend this game, because even after so many years it's still a pretty good RPG with some memorable characters.BUT!Be warned that, even with additional fan patches, this game seems to have a lot of trouble with modern OS.- There is a bug that after, like, 90% of the battles my character just got stuck and I had to quicksave and reload. Many other people have this issue, but there seems to be no fix for it besides the above-mentioned 'trick', which gets super tedious.- The game crashed at irregular intervals, and it got more frequent the longer I had played. This tends to happen especially while quicksaving or loading, and if it happens during the first, the quicksave file is broken and can't be loaded anymore. That combined with the 'stuck after battle' bug gets INCREDIBLY annoying the longer you have to deal with it.This doesn't render KOTOR unplayable, but I can't say I really enjoyed playing it either. So, if you buy the game, be prepared to face these nuisances too.			",308,126,7,70,9,1,33

												Even today, KOTOR I stands as an excellent example of what an RPG can be, and strongly breaks the assertion that all movie-licensed video games are terrible and cash-grabs. It isn't just a great RPG or a great entry of the Star Wars universe, but is also and quite simply a great video game that can be enjoyed by a wider audience than just RPG and Star Wars fans. Story is an EXTREMLY important part of this game, and a highlight to that as well. You are a Republic soldier on a ship called the Endar Spire, and your goal is to escape before the Sith destroy it. You crash land on the planet Taris, and your adventure unfolds through exploration, character-development, and revelation. Choice is present in this game as well, adding replay-value as well. I cannot give away much about the story without spoiling the game, and it is best to experience it for yourself. Personally, I had no qualms with it, and the game stays true to the Star Wars universe while adding flavours of its own. The setting of 4000 years prior to the movies also makes it so you can appreciate the story without any past knowledge of Star Wars. I would even dare to say that this game easily triumphs over the stories of the movies.How about gameplay? It is a turn-based game with many different weapons (from ranged to melee), powers and abilities that can be disposed against the enemy, and thankfully this game has a lot of different foes to defeat. The layers of strategy are quite endless, as you always have two squad-mates present at any time. Do you charge into battle while they cover you with gun-fire? Do you all throw grenades to make quick work of your foes? Difficulty options are also present, which are nice as some weapon configurations can allow you to be a god while others will leave you crying for mercy. Luckily with squad-mates, this is really a non-issue. There are also side activities, called swoop racing and pazzak, which are fun side games that provide replayability.Also a side note, but combat can be paused to issue commands, and you watch the action unfold. Modifiers can allow you to deal more/less damage, and you can even miss, as the game has a dice-roll mechanic in its turn-based formula.As for graphics, the game is clearly dated by today's standards. In terms of art style, this game is spot on. It retains Star Wars' signature look and style, and developer BioWare has added their own flair and style to it, making the game stand out in this department, and being memorable to that. This can also be said for the sound, which is indentical to what you would expect from the franchise. Lasers to lightsabers all sound spot-on, and both the soundtrack and voice work are fantastic as well. In terms of replayability, the great story and presence of choice already make it a game that you can put multiple playthroughs into. There are also many side quests and lore that you can delve into, and maybe you'll see something that you didn't see before on a second or third playthrough. Even the gameplay can offer up different experiences depending on how you play. My run of the game was about 31 hours, and this was ignoring most side-quests, so you will find your money's worth at $10.99, especially if this game goes on sale. Honestly, this is one of few games I can say I didn't have any personal issues with. Others may differ in opinion, but to me KOTOR was flawless. If you're a Star Wars or RPG fan, this game is a MUST BUY. I'd strongly reccomend it to anyone, however the combat mechanics may turn some off, especially if you loathe RNG. However, in this particular game it comes off as natural and is perfectly fine, unlike the TES III Morrwind combat system, as it is turn-based. If I had to rate this game out of 10, it would definitely be a 10/10, but like every game it does have mechanics that have the potential to be even better. ",62,5,0,11,8,0,13

												Star wars knights of the Old Republic is a master piece and an example of what a game should be. It has memorable characters, fun gameplay, amazing story, great atmosphere, good gameplay mechanics, and doesn't feel stale after 3 replays. Even though textures are very much starting to show their age it still doesn't look bad and even still has some visually stunning areas (I still take a second to admire Mannan). Sadly though, some people are not willing to lookup how to fix the easily fixable issues they are having trying to get the game not to crash and would rather leave a bad review and are thus ruining the score of this near flawless game. I would recommend anyone who is a Star Wars fan to check this game out, anyone who is a RPG fan to check this game out, and just anyone who is able to load up a video game to CHECK THIS GAME OUT. Go in knowing nothing and come out loving everything. 10/10- A truly unforgettable experience			",130,27,0,16,20,1,11

												Got the steam version of this game as a gift from a friend, and after playing it two times I'm ready to write down this review. KOTOR is an amazing game with one of the best SW stories so far. It's story is, in my honest opinion, better than anything the new canon has to offer. It's combat system and storytelling is one of the best of it's time. KOTOR's companion sidequests will make you start seeing them as something more than regular companions who just follow you around healing you or tanking damage for you.If you like Star Wars (and want to get into the Legends part of it's lore) and a classic RPG-style game, this game is for you.

												Ahhh, yes.Sweet ol' KOTOR.At first it might seem quite complex to figure out what to do, but once you get a hang of that, playin' will not only become a piece of cake... naw, it'll get you somethin' special.You won't be able to stop yourself from sneaking, looting, shooting, light-sabering, trading, framing, doin' quests, repairing droids, swoop racing, Pazaak playing, lockpicking, droid jamming, Force using, story appreciating, fighting Sith, fighting Jedi, killing mercs, forming your squad, levelling up, upgrading stuff, getting high, killing the Gizka, being rude, being nice, intimidating, persuading, hypnotizing things, getting surprised, trolling your allies, solving puzzles, getting gear, learning Force, planet travelling, relaxing at the beach, earning credits, enjoying the game.Yes.Also, it's Star Wars.

												Just recently bought this game on Steam after owning it for a few years on Xbox. The PC version is far superior (go figure) and it doesn't suffer from any bugs as you may hear as Steam recently updated it to be compatible with up to Windows 8 (and possibly 10). Only buy this game however if you are willing to invest dozens or even hundreds of hours into a game. It's a juicy one boys and girls. Tons of content, multiple paths, many weapon and gear combinations, charming characters, great music, and beautiful environments. A must have for all gamers. P.S. One of the few Star Wars games where a Light Side playthrough is just as rewarding as a Dark Side. XD			",60,5,0,1,3,2,10

												I'm a great fan of Bioware. The quality of their games in term of gaming experience is totally something else. Now coming on to one of the best games ever made, Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic is a great addition to Star Wars timeline. Chronologically this games predates the movies by roughly 4000 years. At the time of writing this review this game is more than 13 years old but there wasn't a single moment in the game where I felt like playing an old out-dated game. And this is one great quality for a game to have. Talking about why you should buy this game:Reasons To Buy: You love RPG, you buy it. You love Star Wars, you buy it. Great story progression. Interesting character development. Detailed character upgrade tree. Expands the Star Wars universe in extremely style. Very affordable in price than other games.The game is totally deserving the current price of the game now luckily for me I got it during Star Wars sale so it was a bonus for me. But seriously there is no reason a Star Wars fan shouldn't play this game. Its a must play and must have. Cheers!!!			",71,18,4,10,0,0,0

												Despite dodgy AI from non-primary characters, it's still an incredibly timeless game with a great story and a great expansion on Star Wars lore.Feat progression for each individual class can be confusing for first-timers but if attention is paid, it's all quite easy to pick up on. The ability to choose to gravitate towards the Light or Dark side of the Force is fantastic; as is the ability to choose Force powers to go with your choice (ie. Light side powers involve buffing, Dark side powers have things such as Choke and Force Lightning). Obviously the Dark side is a lot more fun, simply due to the dialogue options you have available, the ability to earn a lot more coin and the joy of choking your enemies.Great game.

A good story, which, thanks to the settings in the Old republic-era make you think of how big the Star Wars-univers is.  I realy like it and for those of you who feel that you want to escape the prequals, originals and sequals and still have fun in Star Wars-univers, it is totaly the game for you! The good story with the different options make you feel a bit of personal involvment in the happinings. Give it a try and may the Force be with you!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Rank: 9/10Recommendation(s): Like Star Wars, RPG games, and old school game mechanics.Major Theme: This old title shows us how games should be made.Bought at Price: $10.99I have over a thousand hours on Dota 2, 700+ on Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and more than enough on Garry's Mod. So why would I play this game if I have plenty of hours on my other games? There's a simple reason for this.Bioware. Yes, the timely company turned EA division, makes this game great.While this game will prove a challenge for people who want non-stop action, this classic title has to be one of the most solid RPG games, if not PC titles ever made. Before I got a Steam account, I played this game with CDs (yes real CDs).There's actual content to the story, and the plot is well thought out and executed. Your actions will have consequences, and will either lead you down to the light or dark side of the force. Beyond just simple dark vs. light, the game offers other ways of having a unique experience.

The only limiting part of the game is base story, which should be entertaining and engaging. It can be a little dry, as there is a lack of humor, but this title does very well considering its ESRB rating (Mass Effect isn't in the same boat).

As always, it wouldn't be a Bioware game without companions. Each offers something unique, and will progress your back story which isn't mandatory.

Downsides? Well every game has some which isn't surprising. For being an old title, the graphics are very simple. If you failed to notice the processor requirement of an Intel Pentium 3, then I'm not sure what to say. There's nothing you can really do to improve the graphics of the title, but there are certainly ways to modernize them. By default the game is only compatible with a 4:3 ratio monitor. By using third-party utilities, you can resolve this and get a better experience with a now standard 16:9 monitor.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=427275987Being an old school game, it does have all the “attributes” available. Yes, you will have to micro manage things like points in “wisdom” and “dexterity”. If you want to avoid all of that, play with the “auto upgrade” button. The game does also have a “dice roll” system, where there are chances to miss/hit and not do complete damage. Mass Effect 1 carried on from this, in case you were wondering where that game got its mechanic from.All in all, this title should impress you for being so old, yet being so solid. Why games aren't being made like this anymore, who knows..			",160,24,1,13,24,0,25

												FIRST OFF, IF YOU ARE CRASHING AFTER CHARACTER CREATION ON WINDOWS 10, DISABLE FRAME BUFFER AND SOFT SHADOW. YOU'RE WELCOME.TL;DR: Knights of The Old Republic is a classic RPG and an essential purchase for Star Wars or RPG fans. If you are a casual gamer, or do not want to any reading, I would pass on this game. The textures may be outdated, but the gameplay and atmosphere stand strong. The depth of this game is incredible, and titles like these come MAYBE once a decade.So, I get why you make not like KOTOR.It's slow to start. You have to learn D&D terminology and do a little internet research to make a good build. It's turn-based and feels awkward at times. The narrative drags along at first, and since you don't begin as a sith-slaying god like Obi-Wan or Skywalker, you may want to quit out of boredom.But honestly, please give this game a few hours to see if you like it. Knights of The Old Republic is one of the best and most in-depth things about the Star Wars franchise, and definitely their best game next to Battlefront II and Republic Commando.You begin as a lowly republic soldier whose fate lines up with some heavy hitters in the galaxy. While KOTOR sort-of starts off like Morrowind, where you assist a character in saving the world, it is soon up to you to bring down the Sith armies and rival gangs, and to restore order to the galaxy.On your journey, you will have to make many black-and-white moral decisions that have little to no ambiguity, and pretty barebones consequences. I don't really mind this honestly: it's Star Wars, not exactly a franchise known for grey areas.You will also meet many well-rounded and relatable characters along the way: Carth Onasi is a hardened Republic soldier who's seen more than his fair share of combat, and holds deep inner turmoil for what happened in his past. He tries to keep on the mission at hand, and is a strong leader despite his occasional cynicism.Mission Vao and Zaalbar are two rebellious, street-smart characters who are on the run, and have to look out for each other to survive. Their bond reminds me of something out of a movie.And the list goes on. KOTOR's allies that you discover on your journey to the light or dark side are ultimately what make this game so much fun. You may often see your allies talk amongst themselves, and occasionally even fight over small issues. This creates a sort of humanity and real vibe to the world you are playing in.KOTOR also divulges topics like religion, politics, racism, and more, often directly in the dialogue, or in situations with NPCs in the world. I've had to save racially oppressed aliens more than a few times from the punk♥♥♥♥♥humans. The Empire, while not an official superpower yet, holds control over the planets they conquer in a fascist, do-as-we-say kind of government. This was very interesting to see, as similar imagery directly alludes to Nazi Germany in The Force Awakens.The items and environments in KOTOR are fantastic and do the franchise great justice. Nothing I saw in-game took me out of the experience in any way, and the pace felt fine as I played.There are also many things to do apart from the ""main story"": you can help merchants, save or kill civilians, break into apartment rooms, go after bounty hunters or do bounties yourself, participate in duels, gamble, race swoop bikes, and the list goes on and on. While KOTOR sticks to the basic premise of jedi=good, sith=evil, there is enough creativity in the story for you to be the character you want to be. The story is not a one-note, drab playthrough; there are many different ways to play. The characters feel human enough that there is often moral conflict when in different situations.Honestly, I haven't even finished the game and I could write forever. KOTOR belongs up there with the likes of Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, Deus Ex, and System Shock 2 for the best RPGs of all time. Get this if you like Star Wars or RPGs.			",183,8,0,14,10,0,5

												It will never come out of style. The feels, the nostalgica, the characters, the atmosphere, the music. I played it back when it came out and i will continue playing it. In my opinion, it is the best Star Wars game and (-maybe) the best ?rpg?.  Even if you generally don't like rpg games, give it a try. It will soak you into it's world and its so gooood.Edit: Try out ""Flawless Widescreen"" for a better resolution!			",74,1,0,7,3,1,9

												It's a shame they didn't add the 4k textures and a widescreen fix like in KotOR II, but this game is amazing. Widescreen support can be added via Flawless Widescreen.One of, if not THE best of Star Wars games, definitely deserves a remaster or a reboot. It brings the best of Star Wars mythology into the gaming world.The game is a sequel to the Tales of the Jedi comics (recommended reading) and takes place 7 years after the Knights of the Old Republic comics. KotOR and KotOR II also serve as prequels to Star Wars: The Old Republic. It's a must have for any Star Wars fan!			",0,1,0,3,0,0,0

												The gameplay feels out of date by today's standards, but it's very similar to a turn based rpg.  Skill points are scarce enough to make you feel like you're making real choices upon level up (a common feature of older rpgs).  I found the game to be challenging, but easy mode should let you get through if you just want to experience the story.  The story is incredible and that's what makes this game a must play.   It took me a little bit to get into the game, but I eventually got hooked.   There's multiple endings so playing the game through twice just to get very different endings is worth it.  This game is worth the standard price, but if you ever see it on sale PICK IT UP!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Star Wars KOTOR is an RPG made by the RPG masters at Bioware. As a fan of Star Wars myself, I was excited to finally play this game. I've heard really good things about this game and I was not let down by this game.Pros:+The Story.... MY GOSH THE STORY (I won't spoil a thing because its that good)+The morale system that greatly affects the story, characters, atmosphere, and ending.+The characters feel three dimensional with their extensive backstories and colorful personalities.+The background lore to this game is really well done and when you look at it closley you'll see the parallels to the movies+The design of the locations is top-notch+Gives a more in-depth look at the Star Wars universe.Cons:-Graphics look a little dated, but not too bad.-The Real Time combat got boring to me after a while (although this is something that I don't like in RPGs in general)-It had to endOverall, (9/10) This game is a masterpiece and it is a must-buy to all Star Wars fans.P.S. To me this game is canon, I'm looking at YOU DISNEY!!!!!!			",69,3,0,9,2,0,1

												The graphics aren't amazing, and there are a lot of glitches (save often), but the storyline is interesting. The characters can come across as a little flat, because interaction is left mainly to between-mission interaction, and the skill system is a little awkward but by the end, I felt like I'd actually become a jedi, which is pretty freaking cool.  Over all, the game has aged surprisingly well. Side note: if you have a hard time getting the game to run at first, go to the steam folder where the game was installed run swconfig.exe, check turn off movies, and uncheck enable hardware mouse if it's enabled. If you can't find the steam folder, right click the game, click properties, and under the third tab select 'browse local files'.			",103,66,1,36,29,0,21

												Great game. However, this port, or at the very least this version of this port crashes constently in Windows 10. This is a problem which I have verified occurs frequently among Windows 10 users. This problem is NOT present in KOTOR II, strangely enough, and is unique to this game. Some methods which partially fix the problem do exist, but I would advise against purchasing this game if you have Windows 10, unless an update is released addressing these problems.***Edit from 12/28/2016***Even after running fixes of the game to make it more playable, it is marred by multiple graphical bugs, including one which makes character models partially invisible in wildnerless combat zones such as the fields of Dantooine and Taris's Undercity. These bugs do not outright make the game unplayable, but they do ruin cutscenes and make targeting enemies more awkward, alomng with ruining any sort of immersion.***Edit from 1/23/2016***A bunch of people are commenting that they have Windows 10 and are not having the same difficulties, stating that I must have done something wrong. I thought might have been my fault as well, initially, but I checked the Steam Forums and elsewhere and have found that there are frequent issues with running this game on Windows 10.I do think that this is a good game and recommend it to those not using Windows 10. If you do use Windows 10, I advise caution. If it works for you, then that's great, but there are clearly problems here. These problems are NOT present in KOTOR II, with I was able to run at length without issue.			",14,13,0,16,3,0,1

Pros: Highly customizable characters apart from the preset faces. Light and dark sides choices. branching story Long and interesting storyline A lot of areas to explore Modding adds even more experiencesCons: Cant continue your story after you beat the game, except for loading an earlier save. Not a lot of classes to choose from Game's a little buggy for Windows 7+Overall this game is great. If you've never played this game before you are in for a treat.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												STAR WARS - Knights of the Old Republic is a truly beautiful adventure that can only be truly understood through playing. The game will always hold the number one position in my heart.In terms of storytelling, the game is unparalled. It features a diverse range of interesting and loveable characters who all undergo major character development, and will ellicit some form of emotion from you, be it laughter, sadness or anything in between.The storyline itself is easily the greatest amongst star wars games, and easily compares to other powerhouses of it's genre. The branching story lines empower the player, making you feel like every single dialogue option, or path of action can, and will have lasting repurcussions. Not falling into any clichés or overused plot devices, the storyline is an emotionally fuelled, gripping adventure that will have you staying up until 2 o'clock every morning, just to see how a particular event pans out.The graphics, though somewhat dated, detract 0 from the experience, and are quickly forgotten amongst the rich and vibrant worlds, teeming with interesting side characters and side missions, begging to be explored. Although linear, the worlds feel open and diverse, augmented by anyones previous knowledge of star wars.Many people preach the replayability, and I could not agree more; But certain aspects can only experienced once, and if I could erase my own memory to experience these things again, I would do so without a second thought. The game has mind blowing scenes, scenes that I wouldn't dare spoil so that everyone could experience the same as I did.All in All, I could not reccommend this game to any higher degree. I cannot fault it. It will leave you constantly wanting more. It is in my opinion, the perfect game.			",89,5,0,10,6,0,4

Everything is very well designed and well-placed.+Fantastic Story+Great game length (about 40 hours)+Very Replayable+Good combat+Great main Villian+Amazing and lovable characters+Pretty fun sidequestsCons:-Starts off a little slow. But in my experience, most fantastic games do.-Money is a ♥♥♥♥♥ to come by in the early stages of the game.-After you beat the game, you cannot continue. SO DO ALL SIDEQUESTS IF YOU EVEN CONSIDER DOING THEM-Takes over your life-Puzzles are often complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.

												Star Wars: tKotOR  is one of the greatest rpgs ever made. It is a truly magical delve into the Star Wars universe, with an expansive story, interesting characters, and challenging turn-based gameplay. The game has some of the best roleplay elements extantt o date and allows for the player to go far above and beyond the typical black/white morality of many morality-driven  rpgs. That all being said, the Steam version does not work. A quick google search will show you just how broken and unplayable this version of the game is. There has been no attempt to update this game for modern computers and even in compatability mode, it does not function. There are literally thousands of game-breaking bugs and glitches in the steam version that make it unplayable.Please, please, play this game but for the love of god, save yourself the frustration and do not buy the Steam version. Wait for a sale on GOG. Steam couldn't care less about how this game does not work.			",96,25,0,25,17,1,21

												One of my favourite games of all time and the greatest Star Wars game ever released. I probably will get downvotes for this, but when I bought this game at launch, I had never actually seen the Star Wars movies (I spend more time gaming, instead of movies), so I only knew the basics. This game (+Star Wars Galaxies) made me like the Star Wars franchise and watch the movies. You could compare Star Wars Knights Of The Old Republic to Mass Effect, also made by Bioware. What makes SW:KOTOR such a great game to me is without a doubt the story. The choices you (have to) make, good vs bad, light side vs dark side and one of the best endings I've ever seen in any game. Most of the npc's are interesting and you build relationships with them, as the story progresses.Obviously, the graphics have aged over the years but It still manages to make the Star Wars universe feel alive. For example, there are space ships flying around, even though they only consist of a few pixels, you still know what they are and makes the world feel more alive. Combat is semi turn-based and often relies on tactical thinking. You are able to play KOTOR in real-time but you will probably die often.Like I said before; Star Wars Knights Of The Old Republic, mainly relies on the story. Unless you are a real Star Wars fan, this game is not recommended for players who rather have great combat but for anyone else this game is one everyone should have played, before they are dead.

												KOTOR is truly a great rpg. The game immerses the player in the Star Wars universe, and It has some of the best voice acting and stories that I have heard in an RPG to date (and this is 2010). There's actually a focused and captivating story unlike most rpgs in the market today. I didn't really find any problems with the interface or gameplay (for its time). I really enjoyed Candorous' stories of the Mandalorian Wars, for example. They were compact with imagery and none of the dialogue seems superfluous. I seriously don't understand why this game should get anything less than a 9. I have played nearly every Star Wars game to date (and certainly many rpgs) and KOTOR is definitely one that sets the standards high. Don't be fooled by the low reviews. If you're a fan of rpgs, this is a must have.			",904,197,17,59,57,3,87

												When I look back on KOTOR now, I think classic Bioware mechanics, classic Star Wars story. The merging of two formulaic entities to create something that is certainly standard fair for Bioware nowadays and probably hammered to death in the Star Wars universe. That said, I think about the experience when this game actually came out and it's hard to deny that there is something special that happened here. From a plot and story perspective; A true Ode to Star Wars that encapsulates the feeling of the first movies (4,5 and 6) so truly that it's hard to fault them on the story being so familiar. If you've played Bioware games since, you will also be familiar with what's going on under the hood as it plays very similar to other Bioware RPG's (Jade Empire, Dragon Age, etc) but again when this beast first came out a lot of these features were new and still exciting and that would probably be considered a strength instead of an overused format.    All other things aside, this is a game created by Bioware when it was in my opinion, at it's best and what Bioware did best was write engaging stories with characters that were filled with genuine humanity. So even though the format might seem tired now, the story and the characters are truly one of a kind and if you're playing through for the first time I would bet that some of your favorite moments you experience in this game would likely become some of your fondest memories that you have in the Star Wars universe as a whole.

If you want a review of the different sections keep reading:Graphics- They are really good for 2003 still look good today and very well optimized if you need better textures then there are mods for you.Story- This is one amazing story with a twist you won't expect and is hinted all over the game.Gamplay- This is a turn based real time combat each side gets a round to attack the other, you can pause to issue commands to your commpanions and there are force powers to play with.The Verdict is the first thing I wrote in this review to  see.

												Kotor was my first BioWare title and still my favorite. The graphics are a bit dated, however, and the combat takes a lot of getting used to if you're a first timer (turn based d20 system ala DnD) but once you get used to it you'll be hooked. This game is somewhat notorious for having a slow start (Taris/Dantooine) and not all planets are action-y (Manaan) but when it's good it's really good. The story is captivating and open, giving you choices on how you want to take on the plot, which has a crazy twist. The characters are fleshed out and the writing and voice acting are well done too. Everyone will find something to like in this game. I was lucky to find it on sale, however, it's still worth the full price point at $9.99. Hands down the best Star Wars experience along with Battlefront 1 and 2. Go get this game. ",68,2,0,2,4,1,2

												I'm aware I don't have many hours logged on this game for the PC. However, as kid I played this on the original Xbox back in the day. So trust me on this.1.) This game is by far my favorite in the Star Wars series, it's unique RPG style was unlike any game at the time (at least for me.) The choices you made in-game defined your character from the Jedi, Sith or even the interesting/unique Grey jedi and each choice could impact in small/ large ways the overall outcome of the story and your companions which makes for a lot of replay value.2.) The story (without spoilers of course) is very compelling and complex with many new challeneges as you progress further and even a few twists and turns that keep the story exciting and not dragged out. The characters are interesting and fun to learn more about once you start forming bonds with them through your adventures.3.) Turn based combat which is interesting and though wasn't my favorite style of combat, the formula for this game just feels right and flows well for what it is. It makes weapon modifications, skills and talents, armor and modifications and even the choice of companions important based on the enemies you may face in each and every encounter.4.) Just buy this game! it's worth it. If you like a game where you create your own path, then make one in this beautiful universe of Knights of the Old Republic. Years have aged this game but it's a hidden gem you can't find anywhere else.			",86,10,0,8,9,0,16

												I'm a huge Star Wars fan, so keep that in mind as you read this review.I just played this game for the first time a couple weeks ago, and it was one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had in terms of gaming in a while. Despite this game being 13 years old it is much better than many games that have come out recently.My favorite thing about Bioware games, whether it be Mass Effect, Dragon Age, or Knights of the Old Republic, is the characters that Bioware creates. I fell in love with every single character in this game. The interactions you can have with each character after every mission is great and something I always looked forward to while playing. I thought the romance with Bastila was well written and actually believable, unlike many other games. Also, as a huge fan of the Mass Effect series, it was so cool recognizing voice actors in this game, and they did a great job.The plot in this game is well done in my opinion. I obviously won't go into specifics as I don't want to spoil anything, but the foreshadowing is great, and the plot twist is awesome. Freaking lightsabers. The one thing I was looking forward to most coming into this game was crafting my first lightsaber, it wasn't all that great, but still pretty cool. Other than that, lightsabers are probably the coolest thing ever imagined and just being able to use one instantly makes this game awesome.The combat in this game was something I was not used to and still don't like very much. I was coming into this game expecting to run around swinging my lightsaber randomly at enemies like you would in skyrim. However, this game has MMO type combat where you just click on enemies and the game takes care of the rest. I hated this at first but after a while I was ok with it.Overall, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is a fantastic game, and my new most favorite. There are so many things done right in this video game. If you're a fan of Star Wars buy this game you will love it. If you're not a fan of Star Wars I still definitely recommend this game as it's one of the greatest of all time. I rate this game a 10/10.			",86,10,0,18,3,1,11

												An excellent adaptation of the d20 system by BioWare. The NPCs aren't amazing, but, as is almost always the case with Star Wars, the universe more than makes up for it. Admittedly I prefer the writing styles of the Obsidian-born sequel, but if epic quests to save the galaxy are something you enjoy, you should pick this game up. Unfortunately, this game like many others suffers from a very shallow morality system that often comes down to two choices.			",33,4,0,16,6,0,14

												There are countless positive reviews on how this is one of the most brilliant RPG's ever made so I am just going to touch on a few things and lend a few quick pointers to people who are brand new to Kotor. The first thing to note is that the game is quite buggy, crashes occur at random and minimizing will periodically result in a crash as well. There are not enough auto saves in the game so SAVE OFTEN. This will prevent some serious frustration. The second thing to note is that the start of the game can be difficult to sink your teeth into. You may find your interest is not aroused immediately, just remember to give it time. I had to put the game down several times at the beginning as my interest waned. Come back with a fresh mind and push through and you will soon find the game much more immersive and rewarding after you contend with the beginning. Knights of the Old Republic is the Baldur's Gate of Star Wars games and is one of the greatest RPG's ever made. A no brainer for RPG enthusiasts and Star Wars fans.			",153,18,5,26,7,0,20

												Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis ""the wise""? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There are very few games out there that I would declare 10/10 games, this is one of them. Ever since the original Star Wars trilogy ended 30 years ago we have been given lackluster successors to the trilogy in both film and video game. Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic is a game that really captures the narrative sense of adventure and good vs evil that made the original three films such joys to watch. (SPOILERS AHEAD) The characters you interact with are for the most part a very strong point of the game. Carth is a tortured character you really to have to spend a lot of time to understand. Bastilia is a gifted Jedi who is attempting to be the emotionless patient Vulcan-like Jedi we have come to known in the prequel films which makes it all the more fun to really get her angry at you. Mission Vao and Zaalbar are basically Chewbacca and Han solo if Han was a 13 year old girl. Jolee Bindo is one of the more interesting Jedi you’ll ever encounter; he’s not a member of the Jedi order and dodges any attempts you make to probe his character. Canderous Ordo is a perfect specimen of a Mandalorian (the human version of Predators) and is a combat veteran. You get two droids on your adventures, T3 who is basically R2-D2 and my favorite companion HK-47, a assassin droid who refers to all non droids as “Meatbags” and who you’ll learn is responsible for the deaths of all his previous masters. Oh and if you run into someone called “Juhani” just kill her, it saves you a lot of time. The Combat of this game is turn-based and as you gain more levels you are able to spec into a variety of different abilities which will give you new options when it comes to fighting enemies. However the calling card of this game is the story (MAJOR, GAME RUINING SPOILERS AHEAD). The game leads you to believe at first you are a Republic (insert class here) stationed on a ship orbiting Taris and it is up to save the galaxy by rescuing the Jedi leader of the ship’s expedition who was lost on the planet following an attack by the main enemy of the game Dark Malak. You then learn after you escape the planet you learn that you are gifted and can learn the powers of the Force. You take this as simply coincidence and continue on your journey to stop Malak (M. NIGHT SHAMALYAN SPOILERS AHEAD, LAST CHANCE TO TURN BACK). However in one of the greatest plot twists in video games, you learn that your character is actually “Darth Revan” the former master of Malak whose memory was changed by the Jedi Council. Now while this game is my favorite of my all time favorites it does have its faults. There are extra quests in the game that are just not do able unless you so happen to do planets in exact orders, the first two planets (Taris and Dantooine) are major drags to get through and are not the most enjoyable things to get through. Despite this, Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic is the greatest Star Wars game to exist and is easily worth the 10 dollars.If the droid in Rogue One is a HK-47 Clone i'm going to be annoyed.

It is a shame that Bioware went the wrong direction with the Old Republic, and its also a shame that games like KOTOR have been declared non canon by the asshats at disney, however this game has stood the test of time and will always be my favorite SW game and game in general.

												my opinion is based mainly on the xbox version of the game since i played through it literally hundreds of times.all i need to say about knights of the old republic is that since i first played it 11 years ago nothing else has come anywhere close to taking it's spot as my favourite game of all time, nothing. an amazing story full of twists and turns, brilliant characters each with a full backstory and unique side missions, a believable and fleshed out game world, the game doesn't disappoint. the only real negatives for me are the very short gunner sections which appear 2 or 3 times in the game and involve you shooting down starfighters from a turret and feel slightly clunky, and the visuals can look dated which is expected from a decade old title.but to sum this all up: just buy it, it's brilliant.

												I honestly don’t know what to write.....this game is fantastic!!! I strongly recommend this game, it’s fun and there is nothing more that can be said!! xD It’s an RPG with Star Wars Content, what more could you possibly ask for!!!Now in all honesty, let me elaborate a bit more. 	Firstly it’s an RPG game so anyone into RPG stop and take a look; that it’s Star Wars is just an amazing bonus…..it’s not like a cherry on the cake, it’s like a second cake. The game is smooth, rich and with loads of content in both gameplay and story as well as a massive roster of character each unique and extremely fun in their own way. Secondly its unique, for everyone u can go to any world in any order you want, you can have your own team, you create your own main characters. It’s a world of your own fantasy. A 10/10 game an amazing execution for a game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At this point I highly doubt my opinion will cause anyone to buy this game but here goes:This is the best an RPG can be. The absoloute hieght of lore and decisions that affect the outcome of an entire galaxy. Not only does the game let you feel the power of a force user, it lets you do what you want to with it. But your choices have reprocussions to those around you, some of whom you can turn away entirely or even slaughter. Play this game and I promise you will fall in love with the individual charactors and the universe as a whole. This is the best we have gotten so far in gaming. No more is needed to say. No gamer can claim such a title without having played through this game at least once.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is a team-based third person RPG set in the distant past of the Republic in the Star Wars universe. It is an excellent game, and a great RPG in the vein of other Bioware RPGs. Mechanically, it is a little dated and can take some getting used to, and the early portions of the game can drag a little bit, but once you get to the meat of the game, it's one of the best RPGs of all time, and a truly, truly excellent game.It's been some time since I played through it, so I'm afraid the details have faded, but it's really a must-play for fans of the genre or of Star Wars. It's one of the best Star Wars properties which has ever been made, and it's a great game that stands up even a decade later.			",499,185,8,84,55,5,102

And that is what Kotor 1 is, great in every single way that matters for an rpg and Star Wars game.The best part is of cource the story, about Revan, Darth Malak, Bastila and all the jedis of the old. The Sith is back and strong as ever. The quest for the Star Forge is very interesting.And for a game thats over 10 years old, its has age well. The version on Steam works well with few problems.

												Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, also know as ""KOTOR"" to fans of the series, is one of the true founding fathers of the RPG genre. This game, which produced a metascore rating of 93 out of 100, takes you into the Star Wars universe, and lets you ""run free."" You can choose the path you which to take, whether it be the light side or the dark side, and you can decide which planets you wish to visit. Along the way you will encounter new characters and aliens, some of whom will even join your party. KOTOR is a game for those who enjoy long, deep stories that let you truly decide who your character becomes. It has an incredible soundtrack created by Jeremy Soule, who later went on to compose the soundtrack for multiple games, including Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim of the Elder Scrolls series, and the Harry Potter video game series. If you're looking for a first person shooter or a game with intense combat, this game is not for you. The combat is primarily turn based, and can take some getting use to. However, if you are looking for an RPG that you can immerse yourself in and play for the story, then Knights of the Old Republic is the RPG for you.			",347,82,20,50,43,3,33

If you want to buy this game, go for it, it'll probably work on your system, just dont be so amazed if it doesn't. Just know that if you buy this game, you'll have to play it like it was 2003 unless you go really deep into fixing all the broken stuff, which you can fix by extensive troubleshooting.

												If you ever thought what it would be like to be a part of the Star Wars universe this is the game you have been looking for. Even after 12 years it still gives me the shivers every time i play it. For its time of release back in 2003 it was considered a masterpiece. Now its simply a living legend amongst all rgps fans and enthousiasts. There are simply not enough words to place for this game. Its storytelling is unparalleled, its graphic design although kinda outdated for modern standards remains one of the best out there and the music is what you would expect for a game of this magnitude and more. The characters, the planets, the enemies, the tension in this game are all tied together to make you feel like you are indeed part of something bigger and better and you feel every moment as you play. Everything you have seen and loved in the Star Wars Universe is here and is up to you how to feel and connect with it. Every decision you make counts so its up to you to decide whether to save or destroy the universe. Will you join the Dark Side and make them feel the power of the Sith or will you wage an impossible effort to save the galaxy while remaining true to the teachings of the Jedi?W/e u choose may the Force be with you!!!

												Before I start this review I'd like to say that this isn't the first time I have played this game as I played it a while back on the original Xbox and I just had to buy it again for PC because 1. The PC graphics are slightly better 2. The mods you can download are AMAZING and 3. I just had to.. its star wars okay I just had to, So lets get started with this review and firstly lets talk about the gameplay.Gameplay: At first it took me sometime to get used to playing this on PC with the mouse and keyboard but I adapted quickly to it and to be perfectly honest I prefer playing it this way than on the Xbox simply because it is sooo much easier to click on which enemy you want to attack rather than scrolling through each enemy with a gaming controller and also navagating the menu's on PC is highly superior and its pretty obvious why. The combat in this game is fun most of the time as you would issue a command and your characters will carry out that command without you having to mash buttons or whatever kind of like a Final Fantasy game but in more of a real time than that, but at times it can be very repetitive and enemies can just get annoying as it feels like they are stopping you from carrying out the story but this is just a minor grip with the gameplay as most of the time I felt very happy with the combat its just certain areas in the game the enemies get a little tendious (Damn Khath Hounds.) Story: Well this is definetly the strongest part of the game as it is a Bioware game (Known for  the Mass effect series, Dragon Age and Jade Empire) and when you buy a Bioware game you know the story is going to be good and in this case the story is DAMN GOOD. I won't give anything away story wise but something happens later on that made my jaw drop. Overall story wise this game has a ton of sub plots as well such as the characters you interact with that come along with you on this journey all have their own back stories that mostly impact the main plot in some way and are also very interesting (well mostly).Graphics: The graphics of this game are very good for its time and I think they still hold up today I mean it is a dated game so its not going to look amazing but with some extra mods you can download the game looks even better and theres nothing bad I can really say about this.Overall verdict: Well I would say if you enjoy games that are heavily focused on story and if you love Star Wars (who doesn't) this is a must buy.

												I just started playing this agan after 10 years, and it's still as fun as ever. Great dialog, decent combat, and an engaging story line make this a gem. Make sure that you get the ""Flawless Widescreen"" application. It injects a dll that allows you to run the game in higher resolutions than are available via the in-game menu. It sill looks dated, but makes it a lot better than the stock 1280x1024 resolution. If you've never played this, do yourself a favor and get it.			",240,23,3,28,12,0,8

												This was one of my first games i ever played and finding it on steam was great mow i can replay this amazing game.If you like star wars and roleplaying games then give this game a trythe game has a great combat system. A amazing story with a magor plot twist (PLease don't spoil it if you know it) there are also 9 companions to pick from you may only your max Squad size is 3 so pick carefully.A light side and dark side ending there are also alot of force poweres like force choke and force lightning and many more.There is more to say but i'm not gonna tell you everything about it you should find out some of it  yourself to make the game more enjoyable.If you like what you read then this is the game for you. the 2nd game is just as good if you like this onethe downsides to this game is you have to turn off a few settings to get it working there is a guide for it it's not made by me so all credit goes to whoever made it so read that before starting the game or you will crash as you start the game after create your characterand that is about it now get out there and save or rule the galaxy.

Star Wars | Knights of the Old Republic is an Adventure RPG based on the D20 System. Set 4,000 years before the Galactic Empire, you are a Republic Soldier stuck in a war against a newly formed Sith Empire lead by former Jedi heroes, whose steps you retrace in an attempt to discover the source of their military power.Pros: Nice story that explores the ages before the modern Star Wars setting, back when the Republic was half its size and most of the Galaxy was yet to be mapped. You are joined by a cast of up to 8 additional characters, up to 2 can join you at a time. You can travel to 5 different planets (with different environments, creatures to fight, and equipment to buy for you and your party). Different encounters or quests might unlock depending on which side character is in your party at a given time. Some items are upgradable standard enhancement parts, others are fully customizable such as lightsabers. Multiple side quests allow you to delve on which side of the force you want to be in. Oh, and the story has a great twist!Cons: The graphics didn’t age too well, many objects and characters look very polygony. If you’re not familiar with tabletop RPGs and the D20 system, you can easily get confused of how the mechanics work when selecting weapons, upgrades and other equipment. Character creation is limited, at least by today’s standard, where you pick from a dozen pre-gen faces among 3 different classes to begin, then among 3 jedi classes. Each planet has a very linear map, with a few outbranching paths, again contrasting with today’s standards.Verdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your listIf you’re not a fan of Star Wars, you probably won’t see the appeal of this game. Otherwise, it’s one of the best installments of the games. The game isn’t too lore-heavy, allows both light and hardcore fans to enjoy the settings and game. I recommend giving it a try, it’s worth the price!—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

If you like RPG's with a lot of dialogue choises, great story ( with one of the best twists in gaming history ) then you owe it to yourself to play this game.I know it may sound stupid, because it's just a game, but... this is one gaming experience i will never forget.

												Summarized: This game adds to the lore, plays very well, and brings you hours of pure entertainment for anyone. Even people who don't have the most knowledge about Star Wars could easily get into this game!Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic is a game where it starts off slowly but as you delve into it the story will progress and you will shape the way your character is. To keep it short, there's actually choices that matter, even though the gameplay might not be as you'd like it still functions very properly and when we're talking about graphics, it is not the most beautiful game but it are enjoyable graphics to look at. The planets and locations you'll visit will keep you interested as it adds to the lore and true Star Wars fans will actually get to see new stuff!The game is pretty cheap and I'd definitely recommend anyone who likes Star Wars to play it!

												his WRPG brought to you by Bioware was a stunning release for its time and playing it really shows you where their newer games have come from. But how does it stand up to some of the standards set by their newer RPGs? Pretty well, in fact; however, there were some pretty major annoyances and some issues I did have with the game. For starters, I just got done playing Planescape: Torment, and that WRPG (released 4 years earlier) had infinitely better decision making paths than KotOR did. I recognize that this *may* be due to the confines of working in the Star Wars universe: you have the Dark Side and the Light Side - each contrary to the other, but really I felt it could have been done better. Your options in KotOR seem to boil down to A) I'm going to help you out or B) I'm going to be a huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Example: You are in the slums and you have the ability to save a race of people for light side points. The dark side path is you can sell them out to some junk dealer because he wants to keep his profits up *for a measly 100 credits*! Just to let you know, that's not a lot of credits. And if you don't pick a side and want to stick in the middle path then guess what, no awesome light/dark side affiliated equipment for you sir! Speaking of roleplaying, if you decide you want to roleplay as a blaster user then you're going to have a bad time. As I said, I just got done with Planescape and I figured, ""why not go a charasmatic path"" like I did in that game. Well, KotOR thinks it's fun to throw you into 1v1 duels quite frequently, and if you don't have a lightsabre or focus on combat you're going to have some serious aggravation. Eventually I got through them and carved a niche for myself by spamming the Insanity and Force Wave abilities. Those abilities got me all the way through the final boss of the game, so another complaint I would have is game balancing - whether it's combat, dialogue choices to avoid battle, or other ways to accomplish things, I think this game could use a once-over. Some of the characters were also a little one-sided, not just regarding light vs dark side, but wholly uninteresting. Take T3-M4 for instance. Yes, it's a droid, but R2-D2 had a personality and T3-M4 doesn't, which is disappointing and I can only attribute it to laziness. The game is also a little glitchy. My characters ended up getting caught in doorways quite often and during conversational cutscenes sometimes weird things would happen - eg holding invisible weapons. A few final annoyances were whenever you suit up (either underwater or in outerspace) you walk stupidly slow and every time you travel from planet to planet the cutscenes are recycled and you end up playing the same repetitive ""space battle"" minigame. KotOR also has bad and unfrequent quicksave times (spam that F4 key!). The inventory was also quite a mess, a lot of wasted screen real estate in the menus and it was nigh impossible to determine exactly what items you receive as quest rewards.While the above may seem like a long list it really didn't effect my enjoyment *too* much (except for those 1v1 duels, ugh) and the game has a lot of merit to it. There are many fun and challenging puzzles, the music is phenomenal, using motiffs we know and recognize from Star Wars that weave seamlessly in and out of original material that keeps the nostalgia flowing, and the controls are quite good, allowing you to mostly play with your mouse hand only. And, most importantly, the story was excellent. I was really impressed overall with the narrative and felt empathy for most of the characters in my party (I really loved the other droid you get as well, meatbags!). Pros:NarrativeCharacterizationMusicLots of character customizationCons:Lack of ""good"" character customization from protagonistA little too ""black and white""Some annoyances (see above)All in all it was a memorable journey that I would recommend you try if you like Star Wars or Bioware/WRPGs but it falls short of my ""must play"" stamp of approval.

												In this classic game by Bioware you play as Dash Rendar, a sassy, no-nonsense mercenary and smuggler. The goal of this game is to go around and try to become a Pokemon Pazaak master. However, most of the time you are aimlessly drifting around alien worlds, and solving other people's meaningless problems. But I know why many of you are reading this, and so I'll cut to the most important bit of information, you don't get a lightsaber until 5 hours into the game. A silly oversight by Bioware Corp, but what's even sillier is the fact they completely forgot this important piece of equipment in this game's sequel, Mass Effect! You know why Shepard ultimately failed in that series? Because he didn't have a damn lightsaber. There, I said it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The story is good. There is a nice twist and it gives you some clues along the way. I can't say too much more without spoiling it.The gameplay is very similar to other games like Baldur's Gate, but at a closer third person view and with a smaller party. Don't expect an open world, as areas are very small and closed off. In the late game you will find yourself wanting to stack your party with jedi with the heal and flurry abilities. Since you have little-to-no control over whether you hit, how you hit, or how you get hit, bosses end up being punching bags. They ignore your control abilities with saving throws and your heals can typically out-heal any damage they deal out. Your lightsabers also protect you well from blasters and other melee enemies die very quickly.Characters are good. I thought I could romance a twi'lek who turned out to be 14. One is a conspiracy nut and a certain old man likes to use jedi mind tricks. For once, I actually liked getting involved with characters and knowing their backstory, whereas I am usually interested in the backstory of the world. This game is a steal for $10. Graphics don't matter in this game. Gameplay holds up, but try to avoid min-maxing to avoid makign the game too easy. Try to roleplay a little with your party coomposition. Buy this game for the story and the characters. 8/10. ",13,1,0,9,2,0,2

												In all my 20 years of living. I have played everything from Super Mario RPG, all the way up to FarCry 4 and Fallout New Vegas, no game gives me a feeling, no, a sensation of feeling like a total badass like Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. bonus points given due to it being made by Bioware.Basic storyline: This game is set some 4,000 years before the original trilogy, during this time, the Sith are trying to take over the entire galaxy, just like your average bad guy corporation, after you spend thirty or so minutes of game time aboard a ship that should've been destroyed by the time you first opened your eyes, you already will have the basic controls down. After a few hours, you will get the force, despite this. I still tended to stick with the tried and true rifle-type weapons, even though the lightsabers, which come in dual, short and standard types, are incredible to look at and use,   RPG Elements: The greatest asset in this game, to me, is the ability to modify certain weapons and armour, including lightsabers and Jedi Robes that turn you into a walking laser sponge, the addition of a conversation system was one of the first examples I've seen, and was used later just as innovatively in the Mass Effect series. Final thoughts: I love this game, it's light-hearted, but can be serious at the same time. I never had as much love for the second KoTOR game, because it didn't feel like the same game, if you're either a veteran of RPG's or are a kid just starting their journey into the gaming world, this is one of my personal top picks, it's fun, it can run on a potato, and for the hardcore Star Wars fan, it holds a little surprise from the comic series.

												Bioware takes hold of George Lucas's Star Wars universe and expands it with engrossing story in Knights of the Old Republic (KotOR). Played from a third-person perspective, KotOR is a fun and thrilling role-playing game that caters to Star Wars nerds and appeases the fans of the Expanded Universe. Although dated, KotOR is a must for fans of the Star Wars series as well as Bioware die-hards. If you can look beyond the technical limitations on modern systems and accept a change of pace from traditional first-person shooters, KotoR will keep you entertained at a cheap price.

												In this classic game by Bioware you play as Dash Rendar, a sassy, no-nonsense mercenary and smuggler. The goal of this game is to go around and try to become a Pokemon Pazaak master. However, most of the time you are aimlessly drifting around alien worlds, and solving other people's meaningless problems. But I know why many of you are reading this, and so I'll cut to the most important bit of information, you don't get a lightsaber until 5 hours into the game. A silly oversight by Bioware Corp, but what's even sillier is the fact they completely forgot this important piece of equipment in this game's sequel, Mass Effect! You know why Shepard ultimately failed in that series? Because he didn't have a damn lightsaber. There, I said it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the best RPG of all time. The mechanics are old, but work flawlessly, the story is incredibly modular, and at that, it's great, the characters are unique and interesting, and who wouldn't want to be a damn Sith Lord?Essentially you and two others are the sole survivors of a ship that is attacked by the Sith. One of said survivors was a Jedi, and your mission is to find her on the planet from which you escape to. From their the story escalates and soon your a Jedi Knight with the decision of whether to follow the path of the dark side or to stay on the light. Your choices impact the outcome of the game.

												Great game all round. decent story, you can goof off and become rich off Pazzaak, or murder everyone and steal all da moniez, you can go good, bad, or just be a little of both. Like easier games? pausing and the seemlingly endless supplies of meds when things get harder makes this game a breeze, while if you want a challange, you can have that too!I recently caught wind of a project called 'Apeiron' for KotOR, that is in development. It's a full remake of KotOR (note that the base game is required so called a full-conversion mod) with the unreal engine 4. If this project pans out, you can experiance the fun of KotOR all over again in an updated fashion for those KotOR lovers out there.Join the dark side; we have cookies. . . or something like that.

												There is the reason why this game considered one of the best RPGs of all time. Made by Bioware long before they started soap opera by the name of Mass Effect, Star Wars: KotOR offers everything that PC Western RPG supposed to - non-linear structure, choices that affects game world, great, engaging story, and memorable characters. I am sure that I did not see everything this game has to offer, like ways of the Sith, or evens that will happen if you visit planets in different order. Some things not aged that well, like lack of fast travel system between cleared of enemies’ areas or somewhat clunky interface. Made in 2003, KotOR does not support widescreen resolutions; however, this can be fixed with Flawless Widescreen.Just buy this game and play it, it does not matter if you watched any of the Star Wars movies hence game takes place 4000 years before any of the movies.

This was my first look at the star wars EU and i love it, because of this im now reading the Books and watching out for any lore i can get my hands on. i have played this game way more than my steam record (had the game before i had steam).So this game has an amazing story and characters, good mods and i love the combat system. If you know any die had fans of star wars ask them about this game and i bet they will tell you its amazing. Its a old game i belive this was what mass effect was based off its Lead Designer is Casey Hudson so its the same guy, if you love mass effect then this is mass effect but star wars.This game lets you be a sith or a jedi some bounty hunting can be done too plus swoop racing and dueling. This game is the best star wars game i have played and im going as far as saying the best star wars game we will have for a long time. 10/10!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bwee. This game might be old now, but its still one of the best RPG's ever made. Star Wars might be a tainted franchise in alot of ways, having produced alot of garbage and many terrible games. But some is good... and some is great, and this is one of the great things.Gameplay wise, it came between Baldur's Gate and Mass Effect, and you can see traces of both games in this one (the ""dice"" combat from BG and the dual morality and third person gameplay of ME). A few parts of the game are a bit slow, most of all in the beginning, but the later areas more than make up for this. And story... well, you will have to see that for yourself. No spoilers from me! It's one of the best in any RPG, with plenty of interesting characters to go with it. Especially that... droid. You will know which one when you meet them.This game pretty much always gets hugely discounted during major sales, so if you don't have this one you may as well pick it up cheap and check it out. You may find something you will like here. :)			",243,94,1,62,44,2,65

												This is the greatest game BioWare has ever produced. Perhaps even the greatest game of all time. The plot is beautiful (and full of at least one big surprise). The characters are wonderful. And the world(s) are expansive. Set 3960 years before the Battle of Yavin IV (end of Episode IV), this game deals with the Jedi Civil War, the conflict that started after the great Jedi heroes Revan and Malak chased rumors of dark forces behind the Mandalorian Wars they had just won for the Republic. A year later, they returned... changed... and at the head of a force of fallen Jedi and Sith.Now Revan is missing, thought killed by Malak in an act of betrayal. And Darth Malak's forces are now hunting the last Jedi to extinction. And proving that Darth Revan's reign was quite nice compared to his...You are a new warrior. Soldier, scout, or scoundrel you are aboard the ship Endar Spire over Taris when Malak attacks. You escape and now need to track down the missing Bastila Shan, a Jedi Knight with a great power. Soon, you will discover your place in galactic events. And change history for the better... or the worse.This game is the first glimpse of Revan, the larger-than-life Jedi Master and Sith Lord. One who had a great impact on Galactic History. And as part of the distant past... still possibly a part of the history in the new canon. It also is the first time you meet HK-47, one of the most iconic droids in Star Wars lore. Also one of the funniest, considering it is an assassin droid.One note: Juhani, one of the companions in-game is likely the earliest BioWare character that has an... interest in their own gender.Cannot recommend this game enough.My gameplay time does not reflect my time in-game, as off-line play is not counted.

												10 years ago this game was released to critical acclaim, winning multiple GOTY awards for obvious reasons to those that have played it. If you havent played it yet I strongly recommend you do as it is essentially your own Star wars trilogy. Ill go into why it is so in a spoiler section at the end but this game has such a great twist I wouldnt advise reading into it. But enough exposition and acclaim, The game feels like Star wars; From the fantastic sound design that captures the original score perfectly to the sound of lightsabers clashing and blasters firing. The set-peices, ships, weapons and armor all look like they are of some older era of the star wars universe capturing that feeling of an even longer time ago. The story and subject matter is (arguably) the best ever told and/or touched on in the Star wars universe telling countless stories of redemption, betrayal, revenge, hope, loss, sacrafice,ascension,downfall the list goes on, you become the embodiment of the character you play (good or evil) be it Sith, Jedi, Bounty hunter, Soldier, Scoundrel with any number intertwining for you to create this story thats set a long a fixed path into something of your own. Again making it your very own Star wars trilogy....************************************SPOILERS************************************************************************************From the point it begins to the point you escape Taris and arrive at the Jedi temple on Dantooine I consider to be the First Episode in th KOTOR trilogy and a story of the players new beginning (obviously). From the time you begin your training at the Jedi temple to the confronation and big reveal to be Episode II and the defining of the characters ascenion be it Dark or light. Events that Follow being Episode III with culmination of the Characters final acts as a savior and a Jedi or a Dark Lord of the sith.... Truly epic.			",391,50,7,47,10,2,32

												Where do you begin, when they ask you to review one of the best games of all time? It's hard, I tell you what. But I'll give it a shot, regardless.My first experience with Knights of The Old Republic was on the original xbox, back in the year of 2004. And my only memories from it are good ones, walking on the bottom of the sea on the ocean world of Manaan, or wandering around amongst the trees of the wookie planet of Kashyyyk all made you feel incredible due to the great sound-design and beautiful (at the time) visuals. The gameplay can feel a bit slow and sluggish by todays standards since it's not superfast and pulse pounding the way some games are, but that's not what it was about, and frankly, I rarely cared so much about the gameplay in this title because of the fact that the story, the characters and the setting is what brings this puppy home. It's safe to say that what Bioware created with this title was a game of the ages, something that would stand the test of time forever, and proudly so. When people place this game on their ""Best games of all times"" list, they do not do it for any other reason than the one that it is a god damn good game.The story will take you far and wide, beginning with your character (which you can customize, male-female, caucasian/hispanic/african etc) waking up on board of a republic ship that is under attack by Sith forces, for you who don't know, the sith are the ""bad"" guys. In the spirit of spoiling as little as possible, you end up on a city-planet called Taris, where you have to take on an underground crime syndicate, join a swoop race (kind of like floating motorcycles) and take out a crimeboss. All while doing this, you will meet companions who joins your party. The companions are varied, and extremely well fleshed out, and they all have good voice-actors (admittedly some better than others).By the time you're done on the world of Taris, you will have spent about 3-6 hours in the game, depending on how much time you spent doing sidequests, exploring and talking to your companions. And that's just the first ""major world"" that you get to visit during your main quest, which I shall not spoil for you! Regardless, you have several more worlds to visit during your quest, and the game can take you anywhere from hardly any time, to a god damn lifetime to complete. All in all, I rate this game a perfect score, there is a bug here and there, but they are rare and have never (to me) been gamebreaking. So to summarize:Amazing storyAmazing charactersAmazing setting and locationsAmazing gameplay (in my opinion, this is more subjective since some do not like the DnD combat in RPGs)Amazing sound-design and soundtrack (composed by the one and only Jeremy Soule!)It's a god damn 10 out of 10 in my book. And everyone should at least give this game a try. :)			",136,10,0,31,14,0,37

So don't stay on the ""old"" graphics.... Just buy it and play it!!			",97,52,0,70,15,0,30

												This game was the 1st RPG game i have ever played i have spent countless hours on this game when it frist game out years ago on xbox it was ♥♥♥♥ing amazing then and it is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing now! This is truely my favorite game of all time!The story is great with a awesome plot twist, Characters are really well voice acted. There are engaging chat options to choose from. The decisions you make have consequences good or bad. The whole feel of the game is very immersive you really feel like what you decide to play as. e.g  a Dark Jedi. The comabt system took me awhile to get use to but once you do you love it there are countless upgrades you can decide to pick for your character and party members i could go on and on about how great this game is but you really just have to experience it for yourself 10/10.

												  Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is still one of the best RPGs to this date and I started this game for the first time just a few months back and it was an unforgettable experience. It may also be the best of the Star war games, but its hard to say since this is my first game in the series. But surely, it falls into the categories of best RPG games ever. Just play the game and experience the detailed universe of Star Wars, and its a bonus if you are a Star wars fan.-10/10			",635,178,16,88,36,3,58

One of the greatest games of all time, if you haven't played it you owe it to yourself as a gamer to play this game at least once.Not only is the story one of the best out there and will shock you in many ways but the graphics were ahead of their time so it doesn't look as bad as you'd think a 2003 game would look, in fact it still looks pretty good. Every decision you make can effect how people react to you so you can get multiple playthroughs of it not to mention two different paths you can take. With a quick mod you can add in widescreen 1080p as well. Best money you will spend for a game, wait for a sale and you can pick it up for peanuts.			",89,10,13,5,15,0,7

												It's hard to find games like this. Its complexity. Its story. Its intrigue. Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic draws out as an instant role-playing game classic, influenced modern RPGs like never before. Developed by an unknown company, known as BioWare, the game is a golden hit by its original dialogue, choices, companions, and character development. The game even expands the Star Wars universe that can equate to the six Star Wars films by its popularity. Despite that the game was released in 2003, there is no argument that the game has a direct impact in popular culture and how it shapes other games, even Bethesda Studio's Elder Scrolls and Fallout series. Knights of the Old Republic is need to be played from anyone who thinks that other RPGs is better suit than this; they're wrong. Never underestimate the aged graphics and look upon its gameplay elements and choice elements that will determine your fate for the Star Wars galaxy.			",158,20,2,21,16,2,40

												Knights of the Old Republic is an RPG based in the Star Wars universe. It is about 20 hours long and it is turn based. Normally I dislike turn based RPG's, but this game is an exception. The way you can go through the game making light and dark side choices is also very intriguing. If a woman has a bounty on her head you can leave her to her fate, get the bounty removed, or collect the bounty for yoursel. The story is also pretty good with a fair amount of depth and I think all Star Wars fan should give it a shot.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is one of my favorites of all time, and with Steam it does have some unexplained issues. If you're having major graphical glitches (but don't understand why because your computer isn't a chump,) turn off shadows and grass. Along with that, set compatiblity mode to run with Windows XP Service Pack 3. You're find it after right-clicking KOTOR in your library and going to Properties at the bottom of the pop-up menu. I was enraged by not knowing this, but I hoped I helped someone out there! Thanks.			",82,11,0,10,3,0,4

												This game... is one of the most stunning RPGs I have ever come across. Having played it for many many years, I have never lost the urge to create a new character and blast my way across the game. Each character you come across is complex, richly developed and voice acted masterfully. The combat (Turn based) is fun and addictive if you're into the strategy-type games. SW:KotOR  also includes the classic Star Wars music, which any nerd such as myself can appreciate. Through each crazy plot twist, you're left feeling like you were actually a part of the story. That you were one with your character as your chose which dialogue option best fits your personality. For all the positives in the game, there are some blaring issues that bring it down, the most frusterating being the ending. After you spend hours traveling the galaxy, you suddenly feel rushed as if the game is leaping entire plot lines. You're here, then suddenly here and then over there, leaving very little room to digest what you've experienced. And SW:KotOR just wraps up. The entire ending zone just feels rushed and unpolished. In fact the entire game was unpolished. For it's fantastic plot and characters (the major seller to me personally), the game included numerous frusterating bugs and glitches, sometimes even crashing the game completely... If you look past it's somewhat chaotic nature, you'll find that Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic well deserves it's metascore, and i recommend a playthrough to all RPG lovers.

You go explore planets, get members for your party, level-up and all that jazz. First played it on the original Xbox, then got it for cheap a while back. Has visually aged like a woman, but plays like a nympho who will die if it doesn't get the D.

												Better than the movie prequels by far. This game was fun, though the dialogue can be childish at times. But that's okay. Because I did everything they said a kid COULDN'T do. I made it to shell city and I beat the cyclops and I rode the Hasslehoff and I brought the crown BACK. So yeah, I'm a kid and I'm a goofball and I'm a knuckle head mcspazzatron. But most of all, I'm a jedi.			",10,16,0,7,6,0,10

												Knights of the Old Republic is an RPG based in the Star Wars universe. It is about 20 hours long and it is turn based. Normally I dislike turn based RPG's, but this game is an exception. The way you can go through the game making light and dark side choices is also very intriguing. If a woman has a bounty on her head you can leave her to her fate, get the bounty removed, or collect the bounty for yoursel. The story is also pretty good with a fair amount of depth and I think all Star Wars fan should give it a shot.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is the best Star Wars game out there, and no doubt one of the best games on PC.Before you buy this, take note that you need to turn off Shadows, grass, steam overlay and theatere before you can play, or you will experince constant crashes.Despite it's graphics, this game was fun and full completion isn't easy. It's got light and Dark side choices, anything you do will determine that. There's no quick path to the light side, or the dark side, you can't pick and choose easily. The sidequests are plentiful and and probably take twice the time it takes to complete the main story. There are major problems, that can sometimes ruin the game.On the Korriban level, one of the tombs will break your 2nd companinon, which really sucked, because it broke HK-47.Every shot and block is all on chance, so even if your blaster is at point blank range, you still can't shoot that scruffy nerf-herder.Autosave doesn't work too wellSith enemies have an absouletly OP life drain, not only stunning you but healing themselves.You can sometimes go back ""home"" when in combat. This makes it so much easier, but takes the fun away.AWFULLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL STARFIGHTER MINI GAMES. Everytime you leave a unsafe planet, starfighters go after you. It sucks you can't save, and the fact that turning is slow and painful makes it horrible. There are 6 starfighter, and if they hit you 2 times each, you die.Whats the best thing?The fact that Companions are bantha fodder, and guerilla tactics are awesome. Relying on them is hardly needed.The AI, is actually not crappy. It's pretty decent. (They still block you though)Leveling up characters, allows you to choose skills and powers to upgradeIt's almost free worldCollecting everything is very rewarding. In the end I had 12 lightsabers or something crazy like that.The plot is absoluetly epic, it goes with the regular star wars stuff, You are a force-user, you save the galaxy because you are the chosen guy, and have a wall of plot armor. But, the twist is absoluetly.....wow....and you'll want to play again for the ending you missed (dark or light) and all the side quests you left untended.10/10-ign10/10-gamestop10/10-angryjoe10/10-pegi1610/10-SunpaiSilverAussieCatBUY THE GAME ALREADYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY			",14,3,0,0,2,0,3

												Having owned this game previously on the original X-Box and then playing it on the PC there are only two words that come to mind: Holy,♥♥♥♥♥♥ I love this game. It brings back nostalgia, while also playing like an absolute dream at high settings. Adventuring through space, exploring foreign worlds, fighting wild beasts, this game has it all and more. If you love RPG's and want to really immerse yourself in the world of STAR WARS than this game is a must have for you. Play on the Darkside or play on the light, the options are limitless and you'll be in for a wild ride the entire time -- following a plot full of twists and turns. There is really no reason not to buy this game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is my first playing a Bioware game ever and hearing the popularity of Bioware in recent years of its story and characters I had to check it out, and what better way they manage to create in their early works and my favorite franchise, Star wars!Story I will try sum it up as much possible without any major spoilers, the story is average good I’m sorry to say I can’t be wow by the plot which I will explain later in more details, but the main plot is interesting don’t get me wrong. The light vs. dark side I should say is cliché but there are some story telling that is pretty surprisingly interesting picking up half way through the game. 	I chose to be light side because I’m always am and got motivated to defeat Malak the antagonist of the game. There are some nice moments where you go “awe” and “what” and that’s good, it shows Bioware was starting to stable themselves as the “capital ship” of 3rd party company.However, their earliest isn’t much what I expected because the backstory of the old Republic never mention this ever and even talks about the origin of the war. Yes they do talk about the rise of the Sith but just a brief one, I was expected a prequel of the star wars movies about telling the origin of what happen about everything; the war, the rise of Sith, the origin of the Republic everything, but no not a whole lot and both side doesn’t show much color. The Sith are so generic with their “I’m a snob so that means everyone I look is a weakling” their motivation of doing this to so weak to me, yes they do what Sith do but what they are doing just doesn’t convince me to show sympathy to them or even see them differently. Is just “he’s bad and we’re good.” What about the republic surely they are some goody-two shoes? Well at first almost but no they can be somewhat corruptive and wrong of their morals too! And that’s what I want from it, the republic side showing its own “both side” but also want the Sith to show “their two faces as well” instead of all being rich snob Nazis. A final note on this yes they do some moments with the Sith on Korriban but not entirely enough to see them as “they are evil but I can see their side point why they do this horrid things.”Charactersthe NPC and partners are interesting as well especially I like that when you got the time you can talk to them and hear some back stories even if you bring one of them along in one certain planet, more dialogue options to choose and you will have a good backstory of the character. Malak I think is a cool villain especially the way he talks plus and robo-jaw that he has is really cool to look at.Now here comes the problems I have this game and two things are repetitive and cliché for the story aspect side. The NPC of any species just looks the same especially on the human side they have the same texture face model which doesn’t add a lot of emersion seing the same human character twice and even the voice, the alien sort of get a pass but their voice over just doesn't because they reuse the same alien language dialouge many times and it gets tired around the ears. Yes, I know that Bioware was at their first steps and you could say is budget problem by not hiring more actors and having to change face textures about everything that won’t affect too much on the rating scale, is just a nitpick problem where you try to discover a new world with new species (though in my case I already know the species) but they sound the same you wanted to see many new variation looks/voice as possible. Hopefully in the second game when the game got very popular it will have more.Choose your sideAlright now the big one and is, which side would you choose, well I should say, none of it matters! Well what I meant was it really doesn’t matter in “morality,” yes of course you still choose your light and dark ending but at endgame, for the rest of the game it really doesn’t matter if you are the lightest person in the world, you can still choose the dark path at the end of the game. So what gives? What is the objective of those light side dark side points? Is really for gameplay wise in armor and weapons, the force powers I made my main character have some dark powers even some of my light-side partners, which doesn’t really matter if you are good or not you can still equip dark powers or light powers if you are choosing your endings. Another thing about the moral points is just cosmetic option but only in the dark path when your character begins to change color. So now it sounds like it only effects gameplay and not story telling which blows badly right? Well at first yes, I thought it would be the biggest disappointment ever since no matter if you are the biggest jerk in this galaxy or the nicest one you can switch sides in matter of seconds. Well I should say not entirely in that center problem, because you can still have consequence when doing certain side quest and do evil things and in some planets some characters will pay you back hard, if you are prepare.No, I think the big point taker has to be your partners’ reaction to the player’s action. Yes they say “you did a wrong thing” but they never “punish” you for it or better yet leave you or stop you even though they are the once that help you do the main’s dirty deed. Most of your partners are from the light side and whatever you do will make them react but not upon action which is really shame. I expect during some quests or the main “dialogue” choice your friends will abandon you and you will be recruit with more dark players and the story switch to another quest, “conquest” I thought. You can be the biggest jerk without a reason to them and they won’t even leave your side no matter what you did, even by the next set of choice that you made “wrong” you can switch to being nice again and they will forget about your “dirty deeds.” I find it odd that after everything I do bad they won’t bat an eye of my behavior which just tells me that my choice won’t affect much around me until the very end, but during the whole game experience I thought choosing one side might affect the story telling as two sides, one fight for the good or join the Sith and fight from the republic and you will eventually fight Yoda! (Which I know that isn’t him.) My main when going dark or light doesn’t give a deeper meaning why he’s doing it, I’m just having that express feeling that “I do it because I’m a bully and want to take things just because,” “I’m good because I’m a goodie two-shoes,” and mind you I’m talking about story wise, the gameplay well that is different because I want the extra status boost.The side missions some I like but is just another generic “do this because is the right thing to do and do this because you are a jerk” Even the options you choose sounds a bit preachy for me thinking “well duh of course is bad to do this but should I?” There is only one side quest I think is my favorite where it involve no light or dark side points and only pure morality choice which about there I got a moral dilemma and I wish there was more like that but I know if it is it makes the system even more pointless.Verdict: The final verdict is a 7/10 a good starting game for Bioware’s time but need improvement on the writing, and moral choice but other than that I did enjoy the game despite some minor flaws the gameplay works flawlessly and I don’t have much of a problem to say, hopefully when I finish star war kotor 2 maybe things will change and improve until then, may the force be with you.

												If you ever wondered where games like Mass Effect or Dragon Age came from, then sit down, my child, and let me tell you of a game called KOTOR. This game is one of the best, all-time Western RPGs. Yeah, it's showing its age compared to more modern RPGs. Yeah, the combat system is clunky and easy to exploit (the AI's pathing is awful). Yeah, the graphics aren't the great thing they were back in the early 2000s. But the real heart of this game is the story and characters. It was one of the first games of its kind and wasn't afraid to take risks, paying homage to the old Star Wars trilogy while creating its own interesting universe and characters. I had this game as a kid on my old Dell (it was piece of junk) like ten years ago and I thought this game was the♥♥♥♥♥♥back then. Basically, you play as a Jedi trying to stop the Sith from destroying the Republic. You can use the Force to bring unholy destruction on the dirty non-Jedi plebes or even just use blasters, because lightsabers are for the weak.Generally, the choices go between being the nicest guy (or lady!) in the galaxy, or being a total♥♥♥♥♥♥ But there's a lot of good writing you don't see in a lot of modern video games. Especially from your companions (9 of them in total). I'm able to get it running on my MSI laptop w/Windows 10, so I'm not sure the difficulty others are having. I disabled movies and it works just fine (you're not missing out on anything essential with the movies). Also, get Flawless Widescreen from somewhere in the internets if you have a large monitor, it helps a bunch with some of the visual glitches users run into. If this game comes on sale and you like Star Wars or RPGs, definitely consider buying it.			",32,10,0,14,2,0,12

												One of the best Star Wars licence game ever made and one of the best RPG games of all time. Period.There's little to be said about this masterpiece. Even being a 12 year old game, it didn't age too badly and still plays fantastically. Possible to launch it in 1080p with a bit of tinkering. Game is fairly unstable on modern OS and in one playthrough crashed about 7 or 8 times. Still, all technical negatives aside the game still feels wonderfully crafted. Endless dialogs, various quests, different and varied locations and choices with serious consequences - all these elements are only a small part of the whole KOTOR package. HK-47 is probably one of the best video characters BioWare has ever made, or even in general. Game does have it's flaws. For example: inventory system is really basic and once you start hitting 20-30+ hours into the game, and if you're a hoarder, it gets very difficult to find stuff that you need, since everything is thrown into one pile. Camera can take some getting used to, but overall won't be too much of a trouble. AI pathing is poor, ofter will your AI partners get stuck and you'll have to take control of them to make them move towards you again. Also your AI doesn't use health packs, stimulants, or any other consumable, half the time they don't even use their learned abilities. There is a ""Script"" option, but it's very basic, since you can't customize it, and it only offers 3 rudimentary options. Some of the above mentioned negatives are more or less nitpicks, since this is technically a turn-based RPG, so you are encouraged to micromanage everything yourself, rather than let the AI do everything for you. This might be a deal breaker for some, but I personally did not find it too difficult to setup fights with my party, while also controlling my own character. Game does have a pause, so you can always pause and take a breather if things are getting out of hand.As a 12 year old RPG game, it puts most today's RPG to shame with what it has to offer.A must have game for any RPG, Star Wars fan, or even if you just like great games.meatbag/10			",165,10,1,11,4,0,14

												Now 13 years old, the affectionately nicknamed Kotor is still worth playing. Sure the menus are clunky and textures show their seams from time to time, but the meat of the game, the plot and the character development, is still fresh. The story arc, like with the original Star Wars trilogy, is better if you've managed to avoid key spoilers. Even knowing what's going to happen doesn't stop the journey there from being wonderful because the main plot is secondary to the events happening on the planets involved in it anyway. In true Star Wars fashion, the mission at hand has our heroes hopping from one planet to the next and each layover is focused around getting entangled in the goings-on of that place and its people rather than moving the plot forward.  Captions are a necessity as some speak in their native tongues, further driving home the fact that the galaxy doesn't revolve around you as the player. The world and its people feel alive, though the lack of player accommodation can get a bit tiresome.The world of Kotor may not be an 'open-world', but with a seedy card game-based gambling ring, a struggling racing circuit, and plenty of side quests, there are too many distractions to call it linear either. The same can be said for the physical act of playing the game as well. Straightforward violence with all its lightsaber dueling, blaster shooting, and Force pushing is always an option, and though it is a fantastic spectacle of parring and dodging, the fun of it wears out quickly. Thankfully, a number of encounters can be bypassed with a clever application of a character's skills. Computers can be hacked to shut down security systems, derelict droids can be repaired only to be sent against their former masters, and enemies can be persuaded to disband before a conflict even arises. For a game that was designed with the original Xbox in mind, there is a surprising amount of freedom in how the game is played.  That freedom is echoed in the game's approach to the player character's companions. Though only two can be chosen to leave the ship at any time, they all hang around and level up either way, meaning the dynamic can be altered to suit a situation as it arises. Simply talking to your companions can reveal a good portion of their character, but it's the personal quest each companion has that acts as their turning point. How players react during a personal quest will affect their compatriots for better or worse, providing some bit of control over their personalities, and giving the player the option of role-playing with the group dynamic in addition to their own created character. At its core, Kotor is about a group of heroes struggling against the dark side of the Force while traveling through hyperspace and interacting with a wide variety of alien species, just like any good Star Wars episode. But Kotor offers more than just lightsabers and blasters, and it never loses sight of the legacy it's adding to.			",46,31,0,7,6,0,7

												Honestly it's just a classic RPG that people who appreciate a rich storyline, immersive characters, and a strategical combat system would love. With a lot of the button mashing no brain combat systems prevalent in games today, this game is breathe of fresh air. Star Wars fans will love it and even people who haven't watched Star Wars can appreciate it (in which case you should stop what you are doing and watch it).

I'm a huge fan of rpgs and for many reasons this game really does the trick for me. I'd have to say that the interpersonal relationships and their effects on the outcome of the story are really what drives this game home as one of the best. 10/10 a brilliant story for the ages, however you decide to make it.

												While the RPG elements may not be deep enough to completely satisfy more diehard players, KOTOR deserves its legendary  status as one of the greatest examples of the genre. An excellent soundtrack (composed by the renowned Jeremy Soule) compliments what is an exhilarating ride through the Star Wars universe, travelling to numerous planets all with their own visual style, enemies and inhabitants. Along the way you'll meet characters who can join your team and aid you in your bid to save the galaxy. Unlike most games, almost all of these characters are memorable and developed well to the extent where you find yourself considering your choices carefully so as not to alienate your favourite companion(s).On the subject of choices, KOTOR provides the player with extensive decisions to make, many of which have a significant impact on how the story unfolds. Many of these choices are built around the light side/dark side dichotomy, with each evil decision pushing you towards the dark side of the force and vice versa. These choices influence not only the story, but the effectiveness of equipment and force powers, many of which are affected by how much the player aligns with either the light or dark side of the force.Last but certainly not least is the plot itself. The narrative that this game weaves is widely considered among the greatest in video game history with a twist that (in my opinion) exceeds the famous ""I am your father"" scene. Simply put, this game is a must buy for anybody who doesn't have an irrational hatred for anything involving Star Wars.			",103,23,0,11,7,0,12

There are also multiple endings, depending on the choices you make throughout the game. Mechanics aren't exactly what I'm used to, but they're interesting and fun to learn.Of course the title is a bit old -in graphics and mechanics- and there are some cons, like the extremely unorganized inventory, but if you're looking for a real old school RPG this is definitely what you are looking for. If you like Star Wars even a little bit, this is a must-play.Also, you get to customize your own lightsaber. What are you waiting for?			",14,7,0,5,1,0,2

												Would recommend to anyone who likes RPGs or star wars games.Great game that really stood the test of time being as good now as it was 12 or 13 years ago. They story is interesting enough to keep you playing but for me the allies that accompany you in the game were the best part. Knights of the Old Republic has very interesting and unique characters all with their own backstory and relationships to you and each other. The combat system is better on the PC than the xbox original in my opinion, but the camera can be kinda odd at times restricting your FOV in tight areas. I'm not big on graphics but for a 13 year old game its not too bad if the sampling and anisotropic filtering is turned up. I've only ran into one glitch and it's where the dialogue skips like you're clicking repeatedly but all you have to do is restart the game and it should be fixed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm a huge fan of rpgs and for many reasons this game really does the trick for me. I'd have to say that the interpersonal relationships and their effects on the outcome of the story are really what drives this game home as one of the best. 10/10 a brilliant story for the ages, however you decide to make it.

												This is one of the best games I have ever played. The gameplay is not spectacular, but gets the job done really well, the story is top notch and it feels really satisfying building and wielding your first lightsaber. The game is a bit old now, and it shows with various problems running it. The graphic style ages well and with 3rd party software you can get this game to run at 1080p, which looks pretty good for its age.Even though running the game is a bit of a hassle, I still strongly recommend this to any RPG fan, even if you're not interested in the Star Wars universe.

												Now, 12 years since its release, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic still stands as one of the finest games ever wrought by the hands of BioWare, long before they were corrupted by the Sith Lord Darth Riccitiello and turned to the dark side.KotOR is a classic RPG with honest-to-god stats and skill points, an increasingly rare sight in these, the days of merciless streamlining. The graphics are obviously dated (but not an eyesore), and the combat finds a comfortable balance between simplicity and the necessity of pausing to issue commands to your party.To fans of the Star Wars franchise, the world of the Old Republic will be familiar, but also incredibly alien. Unsurprisingly, the writing is clumsy by modern standards, equal parts railroading and patronizing handholding. You get the sense that each line of dialogue was written to leave an opening for every question you can ask, and characters have no problem imparting upon you the same piece of information a dozen times over the course of a conversation. In spite of this, however, the world makes it incredibly easy to immerse yourself in it. Even with its shortcomings, KotOR is undeniably the genesis of the modern RPG, the proto-Mass Effect, and although you might not get it on with 100 year-old blue aliens, you can't help but feel that this is where it all began.

												This is a great game. I played it on the Xbox 360, but if you did that though you wouldn't be able to complete the game. So I went and bought it on Steam. After a few quick fixes, if any (your lucky), your able to play the game with little to none of the issue I went through. If your a fan of Star Wars, this is the game for you. If your a fan of RPGs, this is the game for you. The way the game looks might be old but doesn't in any way make it unenjoyable (for me). I highly recommend getting this game and the sequel, KoTOR 2. Now if only they made a remaster or came out with a new KoTOR.			",8,3,0,4,1,0,2

												Oh my god, this game is awesome! At first, it kept crashing during cinematics, but running it in windowed mode will fix that. This game's quite old, so it's also harder: it doesn't autosave frequently and dying will force you to load a save up to 30 minutes ago (so always save!). If you get past these minor issues, the game's absolutely wonderful. It's increadibly immersive with great character development and story progression. It's nonlinear, so you can have a different experience everytime you play. I've only played through it once so far and I loved it. KOTOR's got a feature that's missing from a lot of todays games, but I can't really tell what that is. If you're a Star Wars fan, this is a must play!			",92,4,0,6,7,0,16

												You know, every couple years you have one ""pearl"" in every kind of genre. 2003, BioWare and Obsidian gave us ""Knights of the Old Republic"" or short: ""KotoR""And this game IS absolutly amazing. WARNING: May include spoilers, even though I´ll do my best to keep them out.KotoR plays like 4000 years BBY (for not SW Nerds: Battle Before Yavin, or 4000 years before ""A New Hope"").Darth Revan and Darth Malak, two heros of the Mandalorian war, a war that could´ve destroyed the Republic, return to the galaxy as new Dark Lord of the Sith. Darth Revan, the leader of the newly ""build"" Sith army wins one battle after the other, before he´s betrayed by his student Darth Malak, who wants to rule on his own. Now that we know a little bit about this games backstory (which is also included in the game and one central point of the plot), let´s get down to the mainstory.You´re a soldier (or one of two other classes), recruited for duty on the ""Endar Spire"". While you´re resting, the Endar Spire gets hijacked by the Sith army. You try to fight your way trough the enemy, while you do your best to reach the Jedi ""Bastila Shan"", an important role in this war because of her ""Force Meditation"". As you´re unable to find her, you make an emergency landing on the planet ""Taris"", which is confronted with a sith blockade. On Taris you´re trying to find Bastila and afterwards leave this planet. As soon as you found her (after doing some favors and a veeery terrible first 2-3 hours), you leave Taris and travel to ""Dantooine"". As soon as you arrive, your Jedi-Training starts and a long journey to save the galaxy begins...Even though KotoR is already 11 years old, it still has some good graphics to offer. Surely there are so animations that look kinda strange or even some textures which look ""washed-out"", but it´s still a pretty game. You travel to different planets, which all have their individual look. As we´ve seen in BioWares ""Dragon Age 2"", this isn´t something they´re always able to achive ;) Also, some of the characters faces look kinda mechanic. They have a disturbing lack of emotions, espacially your main character. Yet they´re able to eradicate this by having absolutly professional voice actors. The atmosphere created by a very typical Star Wars score, pretty graphics and  very well written (and spoken) dialogues is intense and believable, espacially as you´re reaching the end. Planets like ""Kashyyk"" create their own unique flair and are very well translated from the source-material. Especially the dialogues do a good job of delivering story, feels and atmosphere and serve a very wide variaty of emotions. But as we all know, that´s something BioWare has mastered over the years. The character editor is also nice. Even though you don´t have that much influence on the appearance (as you can only decide how your character looks by some different faces, without having much influence on them), but you´re able to build a charater you want through the variaty of stats and attributs. A good and fair skill-system keeps you motivated to level up and the (even though it´s very limited) customization of your weapons will enable you to create a very individual character. I won´t say much about the story, but.. it´s absolutly amazing. I finish this game at least once a year (also KotoR II: TSL, which in my opinion is a little bit better, even though it´s an unfinished game) and I´m still enjoying it. It keeps you motivated to go on, find all this different NPC´s and involves you in a story that (at it´s time) was a amazing thing for the SW franchise. I recommend you to buy this game and enjoy it. I´ratte it with an 8.6/10. It´s a classic. It´s an example for BioWares brilliance. Buy it now and you will have 20 hours of fun in a world that wants to be explored!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Here is my review of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.As a huge Star wars fan it surprises me that it took me so long to play this game. I recently picked it up in the steam christmas sale for like 3 bucks. I played a couple days later to see how good it actually was. to be honest at first I absolutely hated it. the combat style was completely new to me and I had no idea about anything in the old republic era of star wars so I closd the game and didn't play it for another month. I opened it back up convinced that this game was something. I mean most people say that this is the greatest Star wars game ever, let alone rpg ever.I beat this game a couple hours ago and I have to say that this has been the best Star Wars game I have ever played in my life. Number one this game has an insane amount of content in it. I beat the main storyline in about 30 hours. Most games that hae come out recently don't have a storyline this long. The characters in this game are absolutely awesome to learn about and get to know through the game. the game incorporates a kind of moral system where decisions you make in the game effect whether you go to the dark side and go to the light side. This game has a very cool combat system (was you get the hang of it.) It is turn based so most people (at least me) was not used to this type of system. The graphics are very dated yes, but the game is by far playable. I honestly didn't really have a problem with them. But the best part of the game is that it feels completely ""star wars"" I really did feel as if I was imersed in the world of Star Wars.Now for cons of this game. In my opinion there isn't that many cons. The only ones I can think of is that your ""bag"" i guess or where you hold items in endless you can hold a million items if you wanted to which is cool but the items aren't very organized which is the con in this case. My other con is that after I beat the game I planned on doing all of the leftover side quests but when I beat it just rolled credits and I wasn't allowed to go back and do other things in the game which kind of annoyed me.My final rating of this game would have to be 10/10.

												By faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar Bioware's best RPG. This game is very old, but is still the crowning achievment of the studio. The combat is very tactical, but rewarding if you know what to do. The music brings chills down my spine. However, what really seals the deal is the story. It's unparalelled by any other star wars game, and the twist at the end. Play this game guys!An important thing to note is that it's a hassel to make it run, but if you do... It's a game you won't forget.			",84,3,0,12,1,0,3

												KOTOR (as the cool kids call it) is; put simply; a classic. If you've enjoyed newer BioWare titles such as Mass Effect and Dragon Age, you will enjoy Knights of the Old Republic. Following a battle system very similar to Dragon Age, KOTOR puts you in the shoes of a force sensitive character trying to survive, find his (or her) place in the universe, and deciding between the call of the light side or the pull of the dark side. Of course you've got to save the universe somewhere along the way.This game shines in always giving you the option to CHOOSE how to do things. Will you help that troubled person, or destroy them? Will you show charity, or rob the helpless of what little they have? Whether you are a Star Wars fan or not, this is a must play. Very few games give you an experience like this.The gameplay is no slouch either, with deep customization, party choices, and force powers to train and use. If you're a fan of RPGs, Star Wars, or video games in general, get this!			",624,184,28,111,62,7,120

												The sequel manages to develop this game's lead character in a more meaningful way, than the entirety of this game. The lead character of this game is barely in KOTOR2.That's the difference between Bioware and Obsidian, in a nutshell.The most interesting thing in this game, is how the ""love"" relationships in this game are developed. Ironically, this is the exact thing that Bioware is slammed for doing these days.And ""The Twist"" sucked.This game is alright, but KOTOR2 is leaps and bounds better.KOTOR1 is a ""Saturday Morning Cartoon"" Star Wars game. KOTOR2 is a ""Thinking Man['s]"" Star Wars game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wow, just wow, i can't believe people haven't played this game.  It is one of the games you must play if you are even close to being a nerd.  Just do it.  Buy it and learn all about the characters.  They will play a great part in the rest of the star wars saga.			",70,9,0,7,20,1,33

												Rating 7.5/10Overview: Turn Based RPGThe Good+ The game has a lot of robust options in how you build your character. You start by choosing between 3 classes, soldier, scout or scoundrel. Each class obviously focuses on different aspects of combat. Further in the game you can then choose the Jedi you wish to be: Guardian, Consular or Sentinel. You can fully customize your character how you wish between attributes, skills, feats and jedi powers. All of this leads to many different options and replaybility in how you design your character+The core aspect of the game is that as you can either play as a Jedi that is good or evil. Saving people, being kind and choosing the peaceful solution leads you to the light side while doing the opposite leads you to the darkside. Doing so leads to certain bonuses to your Jedi Powers. Being good means Lightside powers will use less mana and darkside powers cost more and viceversa. I find the system to be very effective because it ties morality choices into gameplay, a feature that seems to be very lacking in today's modern games. +The game supports a solid story that is engaging throughout the entire game. Dialogue is well done although a bit heavy on exposition in the beginning. +As is the case with every Bioware game, the supporting cast of characters are interesting and unique and features some of the best writing in the game. Getting to know your companions and there back stories is one of the highlights of the game. +The game has plenty of interesting sidequests that are fun to play and depending on how you solve them really start to shape your character. I wish there was more ambiguity with the quests because it becomes very obvious which is the good and evil way to solve them. A moral grey area would have made choices tougher to make.+ The game takes place across a series of planets within the Star Wars universe. Each location feels different from the last and has a rich back story that just adds to the authenticity. The AverageCombat in the game is basic, simply select your choice of attack then watch and hope your character can actually connect with a hit. It doesn't feel very engaging especially in the later parts of the game when you become really powerful. The game had many graphical glitches and bugs in certain areas that made it difficult to play.Final boss is frustratingThere are a lot of areas in the game that feel big and empty.The BadThe UI especially navigating to find items in your inventory is a chore and frustrating. The inventory screen is a long list of your items. Finding a specific item can be problematic, for example, if you find a data pad and want to read it, you have to open your inventory scroll through a long list of items until you find it. If you have other datapads in your inventory that you haven't checked yet then you have to check each one until you find the one you're looking for. There are options to filter the list based on specific items but this doesn't fix the overall problem of a bad overall inventory management system. ConclusionI have played this game many times before it came on steam and having it in my library I decided to play it again to see how well it holds up and I was pleasantly surprised. This game feels like the blueprint for Mass Effect as it shares many similarities in its design choices.  ",731,344,32,73,63,8,96

												Since the original posting of this review there now appear to be more trouble shooting resources than ever before. Steam has also improved refunds. I still do not recommend the steam version from personal experience and have had better success and instant playability with the GoG version on three separate computers.If you don't like trouble shooting this game probably isn't for you.I have found KotOR to be near impossible to play through steam. Some people may not have much trouble starting it but a majority are not able to get this game to run without spending a significant amount of time troubleshooting. The first time two years ago after nearly an hour of trying fixes the game finally ran after character creation. I was about two minutes in  but could not figure out how to progress. Turns out it was bugged. More troubleshooting and I manage to finally get to the next part of the mission only for it to be bugged again. After a few hours I could not get the game at any more playable of a state. One year later I give it another shot and this time I can't even get the first mission to load. Close to four hours of work and I manged to play five minutes of the game.			",166,36,3,10,12,1,23

												This game is amazing and super fun, I have put roughly 100 hours into it and keep coming back for more! This is easily the greatest game I have ever played! That being said it does have a lot of issues, like first off, at the end of the game when the magical vodoo pony Beonor VI takes over the galaxy for the Dark Guys (For those who don't know the Dark Guys are evil), why does he then do the tranquil flip of freedom on himself to become a Good One(Good ones are the good guys in this game). HE HAD THE WHOLE GALAXY AT HIS BECK AND PONY CALL! IT DOESN't MAKE SENSE! Also this game is annoying because it takes like 60 hours to get your first glow stick and even then it's like ""This is basically just a cool looking sword!"" If I wanted a cool looking sword I would've just played Call of Duty! Another issue that I ran into is that when I listen to Michelle Jackson's Thriller on the background when playing it in the underground part I get the real real heebies. The main chick Bastilla is pretty cute though so it's all good.... but not really because I still had major problems with this pile of absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥ 10/10			",39,3,1,2,6,0,11

												A game coming from the good days of Bioware, with a deep setting, and a shapeshifting plot. The story is riddled with plot twists, and the game is using a form of D&D in combat, so the D20 still reigns supreme. The visuals fare just fine, and the music is well-placed in the various locations of the game. Sure, there are a few occasional bugs, and some can be quite annoying, which, when combined with the game's above-average combat difficulty, can cause some headaches. But the drawbacks are largely overshadowed by the well-done aspects of the game. If you're a fan of the Star Wars universe or not is unimportant, since an excellent RPG is the same, no matter the setting. Buy it and do the old Bioware justice.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Set thousands of years before Luke Skywalker leaves Tatooine, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic sets you into a galaxy that is familiar, yet new and exciting at the same time. KOTOR is truly one of the best, if not the best, titles BioWare has put out. In fact, it is one of the best RPGs  on the market, and, needless to say, this a game that EVERY self respecting Star Wars fan needs to play. The characters are compelling, and the storyline is one of the best game storylines I have ever played. Even after all the years it has been out, the game still holds up as fun and enjoyable, and still gets multiple playthroughs from me. I cannot speak highly enough about this game. For anybody who wants a gripping and epic Star Wars storyline, this game should be at the top of your list to play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alright I'm gonna go ahead and say it, i love this game. Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic is my favorite game of all time. The character creation is great and the way your character becomes stronger over fighting regular enemies, monsters, and even sith is amazing. The amount of fun you can have in this game is endless! The story in this game is by far the best writing by Bioware in my opinion. Especially the epic plot twist about your character when confronting Darth Malak, this game's Dark Lord of the Sith. The party members are fun to talk to and energetic, especially HK-47 and Jolee Bindo who are by far the most interesting characters to converse with. The first level in this game brings you in the middle of the action! And it hasn't even been five minutes into the game! The first ""official"" level is Taris the planet that you crash land on and it serves as a ""tutorial level"" but the shere amount of learning you have to do especially with help is incredible. The game will teach you about certain combat feats, control, different weapons and shields, and most importantly the alignment system. The alignment system is where you can choose to follow the light or dark side depending on what actions you take and what dialogue you choose to say. And it affects your personality, traits, and appearance! A light sided character will be helpful and looks ""good"" for lack of a better word, and a dark sided character will be demonic looking, evil, and will kill anyone they can for no apparent reason. Anyways, this game is by far the best Star Wars game I've played and its sequel is awesome as well. I recommend this game to any fan of the RPG genre and a Star Wars fan as well, and to any person interested in playing the game or getting into the series, try this game out it will be worth your time and money.

Pros: Everything but npcs that use medkits and drain lifeI always forget about a certain bounty hunter that likes medkits and trigger his appearance underprepared.Fifteen or so playthroughs give me the authority to rate this a Calo Nord/10.

												In my humle opinion, one of the best RPG's and certainly one of the best Star Wars games ever to grace this world. I honestly can't find any flaws in this game (apart from the dated graphics, but that is of no concern). If you ever had a dream of being a brutal Sith, slashing your way through varied enemies, or being a noble Jedi, inspiring his followers and dealing out justice, then this is the game for you. There are a lot of  replayability in this game, and the sequel, and in almost every playthrough, you will discover something new (especially if you start toying around with mods), whether it be new dialogue, new items, another way to do a mission etc, and it is just so satisfying. All in all, if you are a fan of well-done RPG's or Star Wars, this is an absolute must.			",28,1,0,12,5,0,27

												Synashi here to tell you about Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.  From the esteemed developer, BioWare, this game sets the story around 4,000 years before Episode IV.  The Republic is under attack from fallen war heroes.  You play a soldier of dubious background, whose role in the plot is far greater than first implied.  Turn-based, party oriented combat, a powerful story, and a sense of humor make this game a must have!  If you don't believe me, why not take into consideration that it was 2003's Game of the Year?Rating: 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's fantastic.9/10.			",28,2,0,2,2,2,1

												The first time I played this was in high school on the XBox. It was my first experience with a Bioware game and I was blown away. I had played other Star Wars games before this and my feelings about them were pretty lukewarm. But, damn, this game delivered. I think my only realy complaint about it is how long it takes you to actually get to play as a Jedi.			",36,28,0,20,5,1,3

												Still a great game after all these years, there's only a few real problems I can think of:* Controls are a bit fiddly sometimes. I've gotten stuck on invisible objects, and once somehow got trapped inside a door requiring me to reload a saved game.* The underwater section in Manaan is still horrible. Prepare to spend 5-10 minutes /slowly/ walking across the sea floor while wishing horrible things upon the developers. * The inventory system is a bit of a mess. Maybe it's because I loot everything I come across, but by the end of the game finding anything was a nightmare. Just way too much stuff and not many ways to sort it. Other than that this is still a great RPG 13+ years later. The voice acting is superb and the story is the most well written out of any Star Wars media I've come across. Recommended.

												Knights of The Old Republic isn't just a Star Wars game, and as a Star Wars tale it is not a simple side-step in that larger world. KOTOR is an entirely new chapter in the saga; one that rivals the original trilogy by capturing its classic sense of discovery and intriguing story.			",172,37,4,19,8,0,12

												It's been a long time coming but I owe this game and its successor, KOTOR II, a review out of respect and great love for the series. Years after I finished both games, a decade after the initial release, I can't help but to look back on what can be considered the greatest Star War games and the best the RPG genre has to offer. I entered the Star Wars scene only recently, after avoiding the franchise for so long, and these are the games that made me want to saturate myself in its lore and history. This in itself is a feat considering how outdated these games are. Needless to say, the graphics are old. I'd put them on par with games like Fallout: New Vegas, which is a similarly ageless classic that survived the test of time. I'd also say that the graphics here are somewhat better than New Vegas' in terms of lighting and color, and if I had to guess it's because of KOTOR's liberal of black and cleaner, darker color schemes. Regardless, the worth of a video game is not determined solely by its appearance or budget and that is not why either franchise is so spectacular.Enter the KOTOR realm of sci-fi fantasy, space-opera RPG goodness, with a complex universe, spades of history, and a plot that not only manages to pull everything off, but ultimately be coherent and fulfilling. Have you played a recent open-world RPG that promises to deliver freedom and a good time worth the money, yet feels somehow... lacking? Or even disappointing? The KOTOR games give all and more - and what I mean by this is that the story, character arcs and world are so complete that there's nothing that you can change about them. Others may disagree and say that's exaggerating, but it's clear that whoever wrote these games wrote them to its maximum potential, which is something sorely lacking in modern games, especially ones based off popular franchises. At least on a personal level, having played reknowned games like Skyrim and GTAV, this game is up there on the ""most brilliant games I'll never forget"" list.Like a true RPG, KOTOR is deeply ingrained with choices that matter. Your character matters. Your relationships matter, your words matter. Anyone who knows anything about Star Wars knows that a person's choices can lead them down the path of light or the fall to the Dark side. You can decide to be a Jedi, a Sith, or someone in between and all those around you will see and react and that affects the story. And I mean this in the literal sense that the story, scenes, and ending differ vastly upon the path you choose, not just some ending cutscene tailored to a few dialogue options in the game.Gameplay, like the graphics, is simplistic but in the end you just can't deny that double-sided lightsabers are awesome. More than the fighting, I enjoyed the exploration, though I hesitate to call it open-world. KOTOR is all about travelling from planet to planet and learning what each world has in store for you and your character.I was particularly impressed by the scope of history and design woven into these worlds, and perhaps this is because Star Wars is based on an amalgation of human cultures. The universe feels grounded, and that includes intergalatic space travel, special powers, and aliens. It's not in the science and realism of its universe, but the deeply human, emotional connections that are shared across the KOTOR and Star Wars saga among its many species. That's why this game is so highly rated. I can only compare this to universes such as Tolkein's - extensive and relatable even through its most fantasic moments - that you could make another ten movies or games of it and you'd still have material to spare.I played KOTOR II before the first one, and looking back I'm not sure why, but I actually recommend playing it in that order - KOTOR I has a (slightly) more linear story but features a certain plot event that I feel is the proper climax of both games. In any case, if you love Star Wars, or if you don't care about Star Wars but love science fiction (the games are nothing like the movie trilogies btw), if you love intense story-driven games that put you in charge of the story-telling, or if you just plain love a fantasic game, this is a game to remember. And what a fantasic game it is. Much love to Bioware and Obsidian, you are the creators of miracles and legends.			",72,21,0,14,3,0,0

The gameplay is a little old school, a weird mix of turn-based and real-time. It works a little like VATS in the modern Fallouts.

												A classic RPG in every sense of the word, KOTOR remains a seminal point in gaming history. With a unique vibe that can only come from the Star Wars universe, the story and gameplay of KOTOR hold up surprisingly well even today. It isn't the prettiest game at the ball -- and it's not without its missteps -- but I'd recommend RPG fans of any caliber to relive this slice of history if for nothing other than the geek cred and good times that can only be had with a lightsaber (or two) by your side.

												the game has a weak gameplay in the beginning but at half the story its way better. The story is really great and has a good plot twist that supprised me. The only things i didn't like are: the auto save, there are never after a cut scene or after a long dialogue, i had to save each time by myself or i would have to watch it again in the case of a failure.Second one is the the resolution made my game minimize each time there was a cut scene. I love the jedi knight series way more but this one is good to. They focus more on the story telling and i loved there approche on the force. Most of the time the conversation choice i wanted was there, that's something i like, makes the immersion better.Not the best gameplay i have seen but it felt better served for my money than most AAA i have played.Took me 26h to complet the campain and I bought the game for 2.5$ at 75%.So YES I RECOMMEND THIS GAMEThe play time is worht your money, its more than 1$ the hour.

												Just finished this game for the 1st time after seeing that it was $2.99 on the Steam Holiday sale, & it's by far one of my top 5 RPG games of all time.Pros:I love how vast the Star Wars KOTOR universe is (especially for such an old game) & how the player can steer the game in any direction that they choose since there are so many ways the game can be played.Also, the character customization is great & the story is very solid & immersive. If you're a fan of Star Wars & love RPG-type games such as the Witcher series, then I highly recommend this game.Cons:In my opinion, the ending/s of the game was a little weak. It was very short, abrupt, & unsatisfying after playing through such a deep & immersive story to say the least.Also, once you finish the story, you can no longer free roam. Instead it takes you back to the main menu where your only options are to reload previous saves or start a new game. I wasn't a fan of this since I spent so much time upgrading my character & making him look cool just to find out that you literallty can't do anything with him after completing the story.Still an amazing game though! Highly recommend.			",61,7,1,7,7,0,2

												This is an amazing game for any fans of starwars or if you like a good rpg i never thought it would be any fun, but then i played it for 10 minutes and i could not stop definatly a favourite game, I still believe that this game is better than some that come out nowadays in early 2015, if you are a star wars fan and havent played this game, you need to buy this immediatly. There is only one problem I have with this game, there is a high risk of glitches and many other things, like me for example all my saves say old save game with no hours clocked and a cant play it. and people have been saying something about having resoulotion problems with widescreen. But apart from that this game is amazing i give it 10/10.Hope you like my reveiw, please comment and tell me if it was helpfull or not. :)			",72,6,0,16,2,0,9

												When I first got this game in a bundle, I was hyped to play it because I've heard it's amazing. Sadly, I just couldn't get it working because of some compability issue with Windows 7.I tried everything: disabling hardware mouse, disabling movies, turning off Steam's in-game overlay, lowering the resolution, even some mods. I gave up after some time because it was just too much work.Yesterday I talked to a Steam buddy who said I had to play this game because it has one of the best plots in the history of video games. So I downloaded it again and had the same problems I had back in July. I was determined to get it working and even though it took me some time, I got it working. Soft shadows were the main issue. I couldn't ♥♥♥♥ing believe it, the game crashed all the time just because of soft shadows!?Okay so that may help someone here.I'm about 5-6 hours into the game now and it's pretty cool, kinda hard though.UPDATE: Played through both KOTOR games, this one is amazing 8.5/10. The only thing wrong with it is it's kinda a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to get it working, but believe me it's worth it.			",120,38,1,19,8,3,20

												I avoided STAR WARS - Knights of the Old Republic (SWKotOR) for a long time. Long used to WASD gaming it has an unusual but fitting control system that you quickly get used to. I freely admit learning it was the only part of the game that wasn't smooth, and even saying that it's very quick to get used to.Not long into SWKotOR I began to realise and regret that I didn't play it sooner. As a long-time STAR WARS fan, and with how much I enjoyed STAR WARS Jedi Knight - Jedi Academy & STAR WARS Jedi Knight II - Jedi Outcast on release date because of how well-made they were I should've known how good SWKotOR would be.Even now I'm surprised with how well-written the game was. I couldn't stop playing it, couldn't wait to see how the relationships with the other characters would unfold, couldn't wait to get started on the next side quest.The only gripe I had at all was that it was short - slowly pushing 100% of content played only took me a little over 40 hours.After you get to grips with the different controls you're going to love it if you're a STAR WARS fan of any kind.SWKotOR is an old, but superb game.

												What can i say? This game is absolutely amazing from start to finish.The plot is very strong with some suprising twists which makes it interesting as well.The characters that follow you have their own background, and your companions may trigger an argument making it feel more alive!The combat is turn-based and easy to understand, with the ability to pause in the middle of the battle, giving you time to set up a strategy.Throughout the game, your actions will change who you are alligned with, whether its the dark side or the light, each having their own unique powers giving it some replayability.There are many side quests for you to complete ranging from interrogating to finding missing holocrons, adding a bit of variety.The only downsides that i give to this game are: the autosave sucks a lot, so make sure you save often to avoid any stress.The AI sometimes messes up, whether they block your way, they get stuck and rarely stop attacking and bugs out for a second or two.Overall i give this game a 9.5/10 because it is one of the best star wars games of all time. It has a lot of content for you to explore and learn the universe of star wars, i believe if you can bypass these cons, this game is a perfect 10/10 without a doubt.  ",138,5,6,10,9,2,26

												Hands down, one of the best RPGs available for PC or Mac. Bioware (already renown for Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights) took the Star Wars universe and did it justice; proving it could make for a damn fine game. Whether you're a Star Wars fan or just a fan of the RPG genre, KOTOR is every bit worth owning.PROS:+Good amount of customization for protagonist and team members.+Choice between Light Side and Dark Side with every decision made within the story.+Huge, open-world exploration spanning multiple planets.+Non-linear story; both in terms of moral choices and the effects of some side missions.+Some cool mini-games, from Swoop racing to Pazaak (card game). +Endless REPLAY VALUE.CONS:-6th gen (PS2 era) graphics will annoy graphics snobs.-No multiplayer.-No Steam Achievements (yet).

												There's nothing to not like about this game. Considering it was released some fifteen some years ago and is stil played is already a testament to how good it is. If I could redo my first play through, then I would. Nothing, ABSOLUTELY nothing, will beat the shocking revelation of who you truly are in Kotor. The sheer joy of receiving your lighsaber...after horus of grind...wow. You have to remember that at the time, games were usually very straight forward with what they wanted to achieve in terms of their story.I haven't played Kotor in years, and I'm glad to report that after some 8 years or so, this game is still very much fun.I also recommend you buy Kotor along with Kotor 2 because they're both brilliant games, consider them the Half-Life series of the RPG genre. Am I overexaggerating? Maybe, maybe I am, but Kotor just has a special space in my heart.Go get it, meatbags.			",80,18,1,5,4,0,7

												Effectively the main inspiration behind the structure of Bioware's Mass Effect, KoTOR to me is one of the greatest RPG's I've ever played. Even ignoring being a fan of Star Wars overall, it seems detached from almost everything else that has been produced (The Old Republic being based off a similar time frame), movies especially, and brings a lot of new things, despite keeping that semi-familiar setting.It shows it's age, though, with no widescreen video options, and (very surprisingly), no vanilla overhaul mod available to tweak it up. At the same time though, there's a big reason for that, and that is that it has very little in the way of bugs and problems, and looks good enough for a game over ten years old. Another big way of showing age is a lack of functions many have come to expect from RPG's, like some kind of auto-loot, there's no way to heal the entire party automatically.. But the variety of how you can approach situations is rather staggering (But rather expectable from Bioware nowadays)Definitely a great game, would recommend it to anyone who wants to lose a few weeks to a rather engrossing classic.

												It's been a long time coming but I owe this game and its successor, KOTOR II, a review out of respect and great love for the series. Years after I finished both games, a decade after the initial release, I can't help but to look back on what can be considered the greatest Star War games and the best the RPG genre has to offer. I entered the Star Wars scene only recently, after avoiding the franchise for so long, and these are the games that made me want to saturate myself in its lore and history. This in itself is a feat considering how outdated these games are. Needless to say, the graphics are old. I'd put them on par with games like Fallout: New Vegas, which is a similarly ageless classic that survived the test of time. I'd also say that the graphics here are somewhat better than New Vegas' in terms of lighting and color, and if I had to guess it's because of KOTOR's liberal of black and cleaner, darker color schemes. Regardless, the worth of a video game is not determined solely by its appearance or budget and that is not why either franchise is so spectacular.Enter the KOTOR realm of sci-fi fantasy, space-opera RPG goodness, with a complex universe, spades of history, and a plot that not only manages to pull everything off, but ultimately be coherent and fulfilling. Have you played a recent open-world RPG that promises to deliver freedom and a good time worth the money, yet feels somehow... lacking? Or even disappointing? The KOTOR games give all and more - and what I mean by this is that the story, character arcs and world are so complete that there's nothing that you can change about them. Others may disagree and say that's exaggerating, but it's clear that whoever wrote these games wrote them to its maximum potential, which is something sorely lacking in modern games, especially ones based off popular franchises. At least on a personal level, having played reknowned games like Skyrim and GTAV, this game is up there on the ""most brilliant games I'll never forget"" list.Like a true RPG, KOTOR is deeply ingrained with choices that matter. Your character matters. Your relationships matter, your words matter. Anyone who knows anything about Star Wars knows that a person's choices can lead them down the path of light or the fall to the Dark side. You can decide to be a Jedi, a Sith, or someone in between and all those around you will see and react and that affects the story. And I mean this in the literal sense that the story, scenes, and ending differ vastly upon the path you choose, not just some ending cutscene tailored to a few dialogue options in the game.Gameplay, like the graphics, is simplistic but in the end you just can't deny that double-sided lightsabers are awesome. More than the fighting, I enjoyed the exploration, though I hesitate to call it open-world. KOTOR is all about travelling from planet to planet and learning what each world has in store for you and your character.I was particularly impressed by the scope of history and design woven into these worlds, and perhaps this is because Star Wars is based on an amalgation of human cultures. The universe feels grounded, and that includes intergalatic space travel, special powers, and aliens. It's not in the science and realism of its universe, but the deeply human, emotional connections that are shared across the KOTOR and Star Wars saga among its many species. That's why this game is so highly rated. I can only compare this to universes such as Tolkein's - extensive and relatable even through its most fantasic moments - that you could make another ten movies or games of it and you'd still have material to spare.I played KOTOR II before the first one, and looking back I'm not sure why, but I actually recommend playing it in that order - KOTOR I has a (slightly) more linear story but features a certain plot event that I feel is the proper climax of both games. In any case, if you love Star Wars, or if you don't care about Star Wars but love science fiction (the games are nothing like the movie trilogies btw), if you love intense story-driven games that put you in charge of the story-telling, or if you just plain love a fantasic game, this is a game to remember. And what a fantasic game it is. Much love to Bioware and Obsidian, you are the creators of miracles and legends.			",72,21,0,14,3,0,0

												A classic RPG in every sense of the word, KOTOR remains a seminal point in gaming history. With a unique vibe that can only come from the Star Wars universe, the story and gameplay of KOTOR hold up surprisingly well even today. It isn't the prettiest game at the ball -- and it's not without its missteps -- but I'd recommend RPG fans of any caliber to relive this slice of history if for nothing other than the geek cred and good times that can only be had with a lightsaber (or two) by your side.

												the game has a weak gameplay in the beginning but at half the story its way better. The story is really great and has a good plot twist that supprised me. The only things i didn't like are: the auto save, there are never after a cut scene or after a long dialogue, i had to save each time by myself or i would have to watch it again in the case of a failure.Second one is the the resolution made my game minimize each time there was a cut scene. I love the jedi knight series way more but this one is good to. They focus more on the story telling and i loved there approche on the force. Most of the time the conversation choice i wanted was there, that's something i like, makes the immersion better.Not the best gameplay i have seen but it felt better served for my money than most AAA i have played.Took me 26h to complet the campain and I bought the game for 2.5$ at 75%.So YES I RECOMMEND THIS GAMEThe play time is worht your money, its more than 1$ the hour.

												To this day, this is one of my favorite games. I could put this game next to an award winning, brand-new release and still love this game more. There is just something so gripping about this game that makes you want to play it over and over again. Before I bought this game on steam, I must've played through it at least 5 times. It takes everything you want from the Star Wars universe, and everything you want from an RPG, and merges them together. The story is enticing, the characters are all unique and interesting, and the gameplay is just plain fun. I mean, who doesn't want to become a Jedi? Or a Sith, if you so choose. Basically, don't be thrown off by the release date. Don't shove this game aside because it doesn't have the same features as some newer games. Just buy it and take a chance.

												There are two things I like most in the Star Wars universe - the sound of a lightsaber and the sound of an imperial interceptor in space! Even in KOTOR doesn't have the latter, if still manages to keep up with the first condition, and the use of the Star Wars universe while simply expanding it and not getting into the thin constraints of the movie makes it so much more interesting and welcome to changes. And all of these changes are only for the better. It is a worthy RPG with a lot of replay value, but I would wait for a discount because KOTOR 2 was updated recently. I'm not sure if KOTOR 1 has widescreen support, some modding might be necesarry.			",136,44,7,18,22,1,32

Also (with the exception of the final boss) this game gives the most options I've ever seen to the ""Scoundrel"" class. Talking your way out of things and finding alternatives to force and combat will be almost constant as the scoundrel, provided you've focused your progression correctly.This will seem very similar to old school ""Neverwinter Nights"" but with significantly improved presentation and balance.Some compatibility issues may arise, most appear to be fixable, this game is simply VERY old so it's to be expected.

												4,000 years before Darth Vader, the Galactic Empire and the Galactic Civil War, long before all you know is a lot of unknown stories about the powerful Jedi and siths, located in an open war. Im the middle of this war you take the shape of a soldier who's fighting against the evil Sith imprerium, you'll meet friends who'll help you, you're saving the Jedi Bastila from captivity and you'll realize you true personality, but only you can save the galaxy, from the Sith Lord Darth Malak.

The story was at a whole new level of depth and the character development and progression is very impressive for an older game like this. I would highly recommend getting this game, especially if you're a star wars fan! i prefer it over the second KOTOR as well, the orginal seems better made.			",40,6,3,9,14,0,3

												In my humle opinion, one of the best RPG's and certainly one of the best Star Wars games ever to grace this world. I honestly can't find any flaws in this game (apart from the dated graphics, but that is of no concern). If you ever had a dream of being a brutal Sith, slashing your way through varied enemies, or being a noble Jedi, inspiring his followers and dealing out justice, then this is the game for you. There are a lot of  replayability in this game, and the sequel, and in almost every playthrough, you will discover something new (especially if you start toying around with mods), whether it be new dialogue, new items, another way to do a mission etc, and it is just so satisfying. All in all, if you are a fan of well-done RPG's or Star Wars, this is an absolute must.			",28,1,0,12,5,0,27

Beat it as a light side focused on a lightsaber? Why not replay it as a dark side force weilder or vice versa.  After that and you want a little more challenge why not only use a blaster or dual wield blasters and not use force powers?  Don't like blasters alright fine use a sword instead.  Got bored of the game take some time off and come back it will be worth it.			",53,4,0,14,10,0,33

												Alright I'm gonna go ahead and say it, i love this game. Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic is my favorite game of all time. The character creation is great and the way your character becomes stronger over fighting regular enemies, monsters, and even sith is amazing. The amount of fun you can have in this game is endless! The story in this game is by far the best writing by Bioware in my opinion. Especially the epic plot twist about your character when confronting Darth Malak, this game's Dark Lord of the Sith. The party members are fun to talk to and energetic, especially HK-47 and Jolee Bindo who are by far the most interesting characters to converse with. The first level in this game brings you in the middle of the action! And it hasn't even been five minutes into the game! The first ""official"" level is Taris the planet that you crash land on and it serves as a ""tutorial level"" but the shere amount of learning you have to do especially with help is incredible. The game will teach you about certain combat feats, control, different weapons and shields, and most importantly the alignment system. The alignment system is where you can choose to follow the light or dark side depending on what actions you take and what dialogue you choose to say. And it affects your personality, traits, and appearance! A light sided character will be helpful and looks ""good"" for lack of a better word, and a dark sided character will be demonic looking, evil, and will kill anyone they can for no apparent reason. Anyways, this game is by far the best Star Wars game I've played and its sequel is awesome as well. I recommend this game to any fan of the RPG genre and a Star Wars fan as well, and to any person interested in playing the game or getting into the series, try this game out it will be worth your time and money.

												This along with Battlefront 2 are the absolute best Star Wars games of all time. More recent computers will have some graphical issues such as invisible objects covering small parts of your character, making those parts invisible, and sometimes an odd screen effect will appear. Although it has these minor bugs, the game should still be fully functional on a working pc. The game also doesn't have the worst graphics and should run well on most computers. P.S. Save a lot!

												One of BioWare's earlier achievements, KOTOR's an easy game to criticize in retrospect. From the release of Baldur's Gate in 1998 to Mass Effect just 10 years later, most every RPG released by BioWare would follow the same mass-produced, literally by-the-books Hero's Quest outline—i.e., each game’s plot felt like a meeting of forced expectations, sometimes satisfying and sometimes mind-numbing in their predicted delivery—a choice that simultaneously made their products restrictive holds against and necessary stepping stones for advancing the depth possible in video game story-telling.But who cares, right? KOTOR tells a generic Star Wars story with mostly generic Star Wars characters, meeting every generic Star Wars expectation a gamer could ask for right down to the tired, required lines, but it does so almost flawlessly, to such an extent that its seemingly pedestrian qualities make it among the most fun and accessible modern RPG experiences and Star Wars stories. In an age-old formula so noticeable and so repeated some players even refer to it as ""the BioWare Cliché,"" a faceless variable with a background too vague and mysterious to be taken seriously, recognized by everyone around them as vitally important is thrown into the midst of a universal conflict against a threatening Force of Unfathomable Evil. As their life is turned upside down against their better judgment, they’re guided by close mentors friends, one of whose personality’s teeters on the edge of simply being Han Solo before he’s overcome by emotional turmoil (and the personality traits are thusly handed off to a snarky youngster and her wookie companion), the other a sassy, sexy Obi-Wan-Leia hybrid.* Through thick and thin, unsurprising twists and heart-wrenching betrayal, they form a series of close bonds and pass the required tests necessary to rid the galaxy of malice once and for all.Dropping the vague references to clichés repeated, KOTOR stars a young nobody, canonically male, her past just barely customizable to the point of ineffectuality, being shipped under unspoken circumstances that end under the galaxy-wide Jedi Civil War igniting her hidden potential in the Force (à la Luke Skywalker) over an introduction spent making friends and escaping the occupied planet-city Taris. Under the tutelage of these newfound friends, she hones her skills in the Force, strained physically and morally under four major tests of heroism across beloved planets like Tatooine and Kashyyk. What she and her entourage seek, they seek in the footsteps of the Sith Lord Malak and his former master Revan—deceased: betrayal, Siths, &c.**—, piecing together an alien map in order to understand what massive power source drove those two to Team Slytherin, or, like, whatever.Their fall is itself a story existing partially outside the game’s bounds, a series of events that took place after the culmination of the Mandalorian Wars—the galaxy’s previous Big Mistake and a war led by the war-mongering culture of Mandalore, a bone-headed, unlikeable civilization modeled after a single facet of humanity, their sole goal to enslave or destroy everyone just because. The backdrop of this war’s aftermath fuels the chaotic political state in KOTOR; it was a war in which the Jedi stood by, watching—idling on the decision of whether their place included interference—and yet a war won almost single-handedly the two previously-mentioned Jedi, rationalizing the need to defend freedoms and lives threatened by Mandalore’s conquest.Krayt dragons, wookie tribes, life debts, Klingons, Jawas and their sandcrawlers, planets being razed from space, half-naked old men running around star ships, limitless sources of unimaginable power, lost alien civilizations, bland villains—KOTOR has everything you expect and love from a Star Wars tale, wrapped and guided by the massive conflict of good and evil fighting over mythopoeic indulgence. The central theme of mythology itself, abused by Lucas and now by BioWare, here works as a symbol of their aging morality mechanics. Following this game, treading those grey areas became a duty, even if it took a couple stories and universes to figure out how to present believably.As an RPG born in 2003, it almost can’t help but tread that line between oldschool and new-, providing a strategic (but accessible, simplified) battle-management system that lets you plan the course of every encounter at your own pace, coupled with real-time decision-making and exciting action full of lasers and light sabers and lightning-quick force powers and, uhm, grenades, I guess—just with dice rolls, added and appreciated: beloved mechanic of chance in things past. The leveling system also stands as one of BioWare's most fluid and functional (opposed to, say, Mass Effect’s messy, meaningless overdose of options and numbers), letting players tread lines however customizable they can get to the point of breaking the game, i.e., as with many RPGs prior to this last generation, it’s not exactly difficult to customize your character to the point that whatever plot point is impassibly difficult, i.e., multiple save files are strongly suggested. And as such an RPG, it took some shocking dares in character design: HK-47, the fan-favorite assassin droid prefaces every delivered line with the emotional intent behind them, creating a stir of always-contemptuous black humor and irony; and Jolee Bindo, whose entire presence—a good man sitting comfortably on the line between the series’ Dark and Light Sides, quick to point out the flaws (and outright stupidity) inherent in the tenets of the Jedi Knight code—hints at the brilliant postmodern deconstruction Star Wars would get in Obsidian's ambitious sequel. They let us know lead-author Drew Karpshyn was capable of a lot more than farting out game-y dialogue and fetch quests by the dozens even when limited by that bullet-point list of Quest-with-a-Q requirements.That greyed-out line Jolee walks, also brings to the forefront major flaws in BioWare’s championship of the modern RPG format. Areas of grey don’t apply much outside of his character or even BioWare’s RPGs prior to Mass Effect 2, but the forceful impact of choice has been their calling card (& often selling point) since 1998. When choice arises in dialogue or action, the writers strive to bring the sense that you’re calling the shots, that you’re the acting force that shaping its conclusion. Those choices, unfortunately, amount to either following that path of charity and sacrifice defined by the Jedi code, or make your avatar sound like a cartoon jerk tossing out petty insults like candy--maniacal laugh included. Under this system, choices often amount to little more than variations on the lines “I’d love to help clothe and feed you!” or “I don’t have time for your stupid babble.” This never makes sense with whatever narrative is being told: E.g., Why would these characters follow these bad decisions? Why would this person fall in love with this monstrous cliché?Are these aged mechanics and writing a bad thing? I would definitely argue No, despite the lingering force of Internet backlash BioWare gets from more critical players. The ambition driving this illusion of meaning in player choice has only improved and grown more bewilderingly ambitious with every game BioWare’s released, the massive steps taken between each a necessary movement culminating in (as of 2013) the phenomenon that is the Mass Effect trilogy, a series driven successfully by the player choice and personal involvement all their previous RPGs like KOTOR strived towards. It may have taken a lot of trial-‘n’-error gambits—still ongoing—but it doesn’t mean the errors are necessarily mistakes, and it certainly doesn’t mean they aren’t worth experiencing when they’re this danged fun.

												A game coming from the good days of Bioware, with a deep setting, and a shapeshifting plot. The story is riddled with plot twists, and the game is using a form of D&D in combat, so the D20 still reigns supreme. The visuals fare just fine, and the music is well-placed in the various locations of the game. Sure, there are a few occasional bugs, and some can be quite annoying, which, when combined with the game's above-average combat difficulty, can cause some headaches. But the drawbacks are largely overshadowed by the well-done aspects of the game. If you're a fan of the Star Wars universe or not is unimportant, since an excellent RPG is the same, no matter the setting. Buy it and do the old Bioware justice.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I started playing this game for the first time in 2013. I know its late. At first the graphics put me off. Until a month later I decided to give it another chance. Best decision I made. 2 hours in I just got hooked on what happens next and by god this game has one of the greatest twist I will ever experience in this life. Great game, amazing story. Also another game that allows you to choose your path, choices and action and shape the world around you, I love these games.			",101,13,2,13,3,1,10

												An RPG a la Star Wars. A bit dated in terms of graphics; I played it five years ago before I started into Mass Effect and was duly impressed. After Mass Effect, though, I tried to go back and just couldn't  :)   And I'm a guy who loves retro.Seriously, though, a well-done game, worth a single 40-hour playthrough, and the fanatical can always complete it with each class for hundreds of hours of gameplay. My dad did that.			",54,3,0,7,3,0,8

												This is one of my all time favorite game ever. Once you are giving the main quests where you need to find like 5-6 of some machine (sorry I can't remember) which are on several different planets. And once you are allowed to start doing that is when it gets really fun because you can explore and do interesting side quests where one planet you get a choice to do something that can get your banned from that area but I wont spoil it. In total this is amazing.			",64,12,1,8,1,0,8

												KOTOR is one of the best RPGs ever made.Not only it is a great RPG, but it is a Star Wars purists dream. This is due to the authentic art style used, aswell as great writing and music that envokes that awesome John Williams feel. Although this game doesn't take place during the original trilogy, it is very similar, because of this playing the game is kind of like being the star of your own Star Wars movie. Its just fantastic. If you haven't played this game, you are doing yourself a disservice. Its games like this that make you proud to be some one who plays games and sorry for those who don't.And on that note, time for me to go replay it for the seventh time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hands down, one of the best RPGs available for PC or Mac. Bioware (already renown for Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights) took the Star Wars universe and did it justice; proving it could make for a damn fine game. Whether you're a Star Wars fan or just a fan of the RPG genre, KOTOR is every bit worth owning.PROS:+Good amount of customization for protagonist and team members.+Choice between Light Side and Dark Side with every decision made within the story.+Huge, open-world exploration spanning multiple planets.+Non-linear story; both in terms of moral choices and the effects of some side missions.+Some cool mini-games, from Swoop racing to Pazaak (card game). +Endless REPLAY VALUE.CONS:-6th gen (PS2 era) graphics will annoy graphics snobs.-No multiplayer.-No Steam Achievements (yet).

												I played through this game, it's storyline is rich and creative and backed up by some brilliant voice acting and graphics especially for a 2003 game. I will not spoil the story but it has an excellent ending and interesting plot twists which the user will not expect. It is a fantastic chapter in the Star Wars universe and I highly recommend it to any RPG fans as it truly makes the genre hard to better, again for a 12 year old game it is unbelievably addicting and will have you playing the game non-stop until you finish.It has replayable value as you get to choose your own path, light side or dark side you have the choice entirely and conversational structure in the game allows you to make these decisions.Puzzles feature heavily throughout the game and are challenging with little aid, personally I struggled with them and had to research how to solve them online but they can be easily figured out with some effort. The characters in this game are unique and loveable, they aid the protagonist throughout and help influence your decisions if you allow yourself to fall into this game's smart trap of wanting to make your companions happy so you make decisions based on their interests.Overall I would put this game into my top 5 list of games ever, and it easily has one of the best storylines of any game I've encountered as an RPG fan.

KOTOR is truly one of the best, if not the best, titles BioWare has put out. In fact, it is one of the best RPGs  on the market, and, needless to say, this a game that EVERY self respecting Star Wars fan needs to play. The characters are compelling, and the storyline is one of the best game storylines I have ever played. Even after all the years it has been out, the game still holds up as fun and enjoyable, and still gets multiple playthroughs from me. I cannot speak highly enough about this game. For anybody who wants a gripping and epic Star Wars storyline, this game should be at the top of your list to play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. When this game released many moons ago I was a young teenager. I have never played an RPG before and even worse: I did not know this game was an RPG. Unaware of my ignorance I placed the game into the the disc tray of my Xbox and never looked back. Since the release of the game I have over 1000 hours of play time between the Xbox and PC version. But what makes this game so good?Firstly is the the story. From the first second you feel a level of immersion that I find hard to get with other games. What makes the story even more enjoyable is that each playthrough you can do things differently and experience something new.Character customization has almost everything I could want in a game. While there are restrictions with physical appearance in character creation everything else seems to disregard it. The leveling system is beautiful with enough options that ensure every character you create will be different if you try. I find myself being immersed with the Equip screen as well, sometimes going through my equipment just to see what I will look in various armors/robes.The gameplay itself is satisfying. Using a real time turn based combat system, you rarely feel things are moving slow. While in combat you have the ability to pause the game, if you wish, and issue up four commands for your companions to perform. Experimenting with this can be fun to see what type of damage you can do and how quickly you can kill harder opponents.Overall, I would highly recommend this game for any Star Wars or RPG fan. Knights of the Old Republic is a milestone in gaming and everyone should try to experience what it hast to offer.			",112,19,0,25,6,2,23

												Anything that I write in this review cannot possibly do this game justice. It is literally perfect. If you like Star Wars or if you like RPGs or both you will love this game. By the way the reason I have so little time on this game is because I played it entirely in offline mode. It took me about 40 hours to beat the game.			",191,37,0,18,5,2,33

												The catalyst for my love of rpgs. A Biowar game with more interesting characters than i found in either Mass Effect or Dragon Age. While the combat leaves something to be desired, this is a game to get lost in. I've read Star Wars comics, books, watched all the shows, and this is the most enthralling Star Wars tale since the original trilogy.			",202,15,4,26,12,2,29

												If you like Star Wars and RPGs this game is a must have. An even if you only like RPGs you should still check it out. The Story is amazing and it actually feels like your actions have an impact on it and the world around you. While the whole combat mechanic may take a little getting used to it, once you have it down the fights are fun and can even be challenging sometimes if you are not utilising your characters the right way. While i have nearly no gametime on steam i had it as a regular game back in the days and played loads of it. And you can play the game ATLEAST twice to see how both Dark and Light side of the force play out but you can still try loads of different playstyles afterwards.			",32,4,0,2,4,0,9

I was blown away with how great the story and plot where,if you don't look online for spoliers you will really be in aw. at how everything turnes out. You can choose between the light(good) or darkside(bad) by the decisions in the game,so that makes replay value off the charts(plus 2 endings). The control for the game is ok ,not to bad but I have to say I didn't like some of the elements for the combat but you can look over them when you start getting into it. The  music is your StarWars fare so nothing bad about it. So all in all I would give it a 8.5 out of 10			",39,1,0,5,0,0,1

												Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic is a third person rpg set 4000 years before the events of the first movie. It starts off with you being able to customize your character to be either male of female and choosing your class. Afterwards you get into the actual game as your ship is immediately being attacked and boarded by the Sith. You are quickly overwhelmed and crash land on the starting planet. The planets and environments are one of the best features to the game. They are all very unique and offer lots of room to explore. You can converse with most alien species since your character speaks nearly every language under the Republic's domain. Some speak in their native tongues and you understand via subtitles but man do they talk slow. It could take upwards to 20 seconds for every sentence as they grumble and grunt their language at you which made me very glad there is an option to skip sentences with the click of the mouse. It's usually worth talking to them as they explain their culture, problems and feelings on the war between the Republic and the Sith.Your companions on the other hand are some of the most annoying and broody bunch of support characters I've ever seen. Don't get me wrong a few are actually really cool but it would be nice to kick most of them out of your base. You can take up to two of them with you on missions and you can equip and dress them however you like. They will sometimes trade quips or add their opinions into a conversation which helps flesh them out more. An alignment system is in place where you can either focus on the light side by doing good deeds or the dark side by evil ones. It's not just a superficial system, being on the light sides makes casting dark side powers a lot more difficult for you to cast. You can also be neutral but it is pretty hard to maintain. Which makes for a lot of interesting circumstances on whether you want to help someone due to being dangerously close to steering toward the light side which has nowhere near the strength of the dark side powers. We don't start of as a jedi and don't have these powers at the start of the game but it is something to keep in mind. Gameplay consists of auto-attacking and clicking on abilities to either damage or heal. There is an option to pause time and set commands to each of the party members which lets you use plan your battles far easier than trying in real time. At times your character will just freeze up and not do anything while enemies get free shots in. Happens rarely but is infuriating when it happens in a brutal fight. A glitch that happens a lot more occasionally is being unable to move after a battle. It fixes itself after 30 seconds of not doing anything but with the amount of battles in this becomes a real problem. Activating Vsync fixes this problem for some people. You can use a shield a limited amount of times, throw grenades, lay land mines and use force powers which makes for a lot of variety. Never gets old seeing a  Jedi get fed up with fighting a group of enemies and just throws a grenade.  Melee combat is pretty cool as well, they have a preset fighting animations where they kick, dodge and slash at each other. You have no control over it but it definitely adds more action to the fights. Ranged has a single animation where you dodge some blaster rounds but starting off your aim is so bad that it would make a StormTrooper blush.Outside of combat you can explore, disarm landmines and pick locks considering you have the skill to do so. You can gamble in some kind of modified version of BlackJack but you need to collect the cards of the deck yourself. You can also join Swoop races that play like your modern day runner. There are also turret sections on occasion where you can defend your ship from an attack fleet. On top of all that there are a ton of side quests and having done nothing but what I was required to I still got 31 hours out of the game so as you can see it is a very lengthy game. Most of the time you will be in dialogue with another character and given multiple ways to answer or deal with dilemmas. Unfortunately the voice acting ranges from mediocre to terrible and considering the amount of talking you do it may be a bit of a turn off to some. That is the only thing wrong with the sound side of things. The music has a mix of original Star Wars music and some newly composed music that all sound excellent. The sound of blasters, electrocuting people and lightsaber fights all sound great as well.  Story is kind of dull. It starts off promising but quickly devolves into a treasure hunt for maps.  Occasionally you will get a cut-scene of the villain sending some useless goons to hunt you to remind the player he even exists. The story really picks up near the end of the game though. You'll mostly be interested in the politics of each planet and the troubles they are going through like trying to stay neutral in the war, slavery and criminals controlling everything. Your choices have some pretty big impacts like medicine costing much more credits (money) to everyone, yourself included. It is definitely the type of game you play for the adventure instead of the grand overall plot.  Graphics are obviously dated with character models looking very ancient but the environments themselves look decent.  The menus are awful. You can pick up as much stuff as you want without limits but everything in the inventory is seemingly placed at random,without ways to quickly reach a category of weapon or to sell junk it really becomes a chore. You will have to change weapons since some are much more efficient against certain types of enemies and would have been made so much less frustrating by a decent menu.It is a good game don't get me wrong but it is not the greatest rpg ever that some people claim it to be. I had quite a bit of fun with it and will immediately play the sequel after this review. I am not a Star Wars fan though so that may be a fact to take into consideration.  Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic is a fun game dragged down by some technical and  user interface issues but still manages to be a game worth considering if you are into the genre.It's also nice to see a Star Wars game not including Obi Wan or Luke like most games and you can tell they put a lot of effort into weaving their own identity into the Star Wars universe. It still holds up against the rpgs of today and shouldn't be dismissed due to it's age.			",1886,554,61,204,169,17,226

												Seriously let me just be completely honest here. This game is amazing, but Can be a pain at times. The game itself is absolutely amazing and it has a wonderful story that any starwars fan should be enthralled by. HOWEVER! The fact remains that this game is extremely dated and it has a lot of problems when it comes to computers. It can be as I would put it ""whiny"" and crashes a lot for some people. The game is so outdated that it literally thinks some pc parts are older than itself or it cannot recognize them. I know many work around for this issue and they are on the forums, but it is still a pain. Beyond that, the graphics and some of the sounds are pretty iffy, but since it is 10 years old you should expect that. I would still recommend buying this game even if you wait for the steam summer/winter sales where it is 5-10 bucks. (US) It is seriously worth it even after all of the problems behind it. (Be aware that the second is even worse off with those issues for some people.)			",68,4,0,7,3,0,10

												Played a lot before steam was really a thing, so +80~ hours.This is the best Star Wars licence game in existence. Story is deep and rich, gameplay is succinct and accessible. Also (with the exception of the final boss) this game gives the most options I've ever seen to the ""Scoundrel"" class. Talking your way out of things and finding alternatives to force and combat will be almost constant as the scoundrel, provided you've focused your progression correctly.This will seem very similar to old school ""Neverwinter Nights"" but with significantly improved presentation and balance.Some compatibility issues may arise, most appear to be fixable, this game is simply VERY old so it's to be expected.

												What can i say? This game is absolutely amazing from start to finish.The plot is very strong with some suprising twists which makes it interesting as well.The characters that follow you have their own background, and your companions may trigger an argument making it feel more alive!The combat is turn-based and easy to understand, with the ability to pause in the middle of the battle, giving you time to set up a strategy.Throughout the game, your actions will change who you are alligned with, whether its the dark side or the light, each having their own unique powers giving it some replayability.There are many side quests for you to complete ranging from interrogating to finding missing holocrons, adding a bit of variety.The only downsides that i give to this game are: the autosave sucks a lot, so make sure you save often to avoid any stress.The AI sometimes messes up, whether they block your way, they get stuck and rarely stop attacking and bugs out for a second or two.Overall i give this game a 9.5/10 because it is one of the best star wars games of all time. It has a lot of content for you to explore and learn the universe of star wars, i believe if you can bypass these cons, this game is a perfect 10/10 without a doubt.  ",138,5,6,10,9,2,26

												By far my favorite RPG of all time. Quite literally now when I play an RPG I hold it up to the standards of this game, which isn't usually a good idea because this game isn't easy to beat. I still enjoy playing through it again and again, it just doesn't get old. The story is so filling, it's hard not to get drawn into it. I know some RPG's you have to focus or constantly try to put yourself in the protaganist's shoes, but Knights of the Old Republic does it for you. It opens the door for you, grabs your coat, sits you down on one of the best chairs on earth, hands you a beverage created by George Lucas from up in the cantina in the sky, and tells the best story you've ever heard. Quite literally, if you haven't played this game yet, you're the equivilant of a bantha fodder. Don't know what is? Even more of a reason to play this game. What are you waiting for? Just buy it. You won't regret it.			",17,3,0,7,8,0,8

												Very good game. Deffinitely one of the best star wars games ever made. Right up there with Battlefront 2. Very fun turn based RPG with a very good story and probably one of the best, if not THE best, plot twists in video game history. The only bad things I can say about it is that it has very bad graphics that will turn many people away. Aside from that it has a pretty slow start where its easy to lose your way.

Getting chain stunned, two shot and crying in pure rage when an enemy spams medkits and drain life are all part of the experience. Pros: Everything but npcs that use medkits and drain lifeI always forget about a certain bounty hunter that likes medkits and trigger his appearance underprepared.Fifteen or so playthroughs give me the authority to rate this a Calo Nord/10.

												A classic RPG in every sense of the word, KOTOR remains a seminal point in gaming history. With a unique vibe that can only come from the Star Wars universe, the story and gameplay of KOTOR hold up surprisingly well even today. It isn't the prettiest game at the ball -- and it's not without its missteps -- but I'd recommend RPG fans of any caliber to relive this slice of history if for nothing other than the geek cred and good times that can only be had with a lightsaber (or two) by your side.

Now I'm running around making people think I'm a Sith Guard, and I keep going into random people's houses and their all like ""Please no, don't hurt me!"" and I just steal all their stuff and leave!

												Probably the best Star Wars game ever produced. Story rich, with many remarkable plot twists. Has aged well, being a timeless jewel. The setback is that the combat system is not very refined, but that is eclipsed by its overall quality. Really worth the time spent on it!!			",99,18,1,4,7,0,7

If i wanted that I would have downloaded Wookie♥♥♥♥♥♥tribumal.  Wookie♥♥♥♥♥♥Tribunal stars the ever cunning and artistically impotent Bruce Campbell as he searches for a wookie lover.  The game takes a turn for the better when his ship is lowjacked and he gets  caught by the Wookie♥♥♥♥♥♥Tribunal of Star Wars fame.  Created by George Lucas and renamed Star Wars the christmas special. The game goes on with deciding who to coax into letting you be the♥♥♥♥♥♥slave of.

												I am now 26 years old, twice as much as I was when I first played this game. I was already impressed with Bioware's Neverwinter Nights at the time, but the hundreds of hours I spent on KotOR really set the bar for all future RPGs for me. Features you love games like Jade Empire, Mass Effect, KotOR 2 and Dragon Age or even Arcanum, The Elder Scrolls and newer Fallouts for were pretty much all introduced to me by KotOR. A great soundtrack, deep companion stories, good/evil choices that make a difference in the storyline, plentiful side-quests, plot-twists, they're all there. This game was certain to become a classic the moment it hit the shelves in the second half of 2003.Definitely among The Essentials.			",45,23,0,11,6,0,6

												Buy it even if it never goes on sale again. I'm happy steam doesn't show my cd copy hours. That poor cd never left my cd drive for years, and I lost disc 1. If you read this and you are my disc, come back to me.Cons:The combat is a bit frustrating if you are not used to squad pausable combat. Getting chain stunned, two shot and crying in pure rage when an enemy spams medkits and drain life are all part of the experience. Pros: Everything but npcs that use medkits and drain lifeI always forget about a certain bounty hunter that likes medkits and trigger his appearance underprepared.Fifteen or so playthroughs give me the authority to rate this a Calo Nord/10.

												When I first got this game in a bundle, I was hyped to play it because I've heard it's amazing. Sadly, I just couldn't get it working because of some compability issue with Windows 7.I tried everything: disabling hardware mouse, disabling movies, turning off Steam's in-game overlay, lowering the resolution, even some mods. I gave up after some time because it was just too much work.Yesterday I talked to a Steam buddy who said I had to play this game because it has one of the best plots in the history of video games. So I downloaded it again and had the same problems I had back in July. I was determined to get it working and even though it took me some time, I got it working. Soft shadows were the main issue. I couldn't ♥♥♥♥ing believe it, the game crashed all the time just because of soft shadows!?Okay so that may help someone here.I'm about 5-6 hours into the game now and it's pretty cool, kinda hard though.UPDATE: Played through both KOTOR games, this one is amazing 8.5/10. The only thing wrong with it is it's kinda a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to get it working, but believe me it's worth it.			",120,38,1,19,8,3,20

												I avoided STAR WARS - Knights of the Old Republic (SWKotOR) for a long time. Long used to WASD gaming it has an unusual but fitting control system that you quickly get used to. I freely admit learning it was the only part of the game that wasn't smooth, and even saying that it's very quick to get used to.Not long into SWKotOR I began to realise and regret that I didn't play it sooner. As a long-time STAR WARS fan, and with how much I enjoyed STAR WARS Jedi Knight - Jedi Academy & STAR WARS Jedi Knight II - Jedi Outcast on release date because of how well-made they were I should've known how good SWKotOR would be.Even now I'm surprised with how well-written the game was. I couldn't stop playing it, couldn't wait to see how the relationships with the other characters would unfold, couldn't wait to get started on the next side quest.The only gripe I had at all was that it was short - slowly pushing 100% of content played only took me a little over 40 hours.After you get to grips with the different controls you're going to love it if you're a STAR WARS fan of any kind.SWKotOR is an old, but superb game.

With its twisted plots and alternate endings, Bioware went above and beyond in 2003. Well worth 9.99.!			",3,1,0,2,1,0,4

												Seriously let me just be completely honest here. This game is amazing, but Can be a pain at times. The game itself is absolutely amazing and it has a wonderful story that any starwars fan should be enthralled by. HOWEVER! The fact remains that this game is extremely dated and it has a lot of problems when it comes to computers. It can be as I would put it ""whiny"" and crashes a lot for some people. The game is so outdated that it literally thinks some pc parts are older than itself or it cannot recognize them. I know many work around for this issue and they are on the forums, but it is still a pain. Beyond that, the graphics and some of the sounds are pretty iffy, but since it is 10 years old you should expect that. I would still recommend buying this game even if you wait for the steam summer/winter sales where it is 5-10 bucks. (US) It is seriously worth it even after all of the problems behind it. (Be aware that the second is even worse off with those issues for some people.)			",68,4,0,7,3,0,10

												This game made me love Star Wars again, in short it's what you get when you get Mass Effect but with more likable stronger characters and weaker graphic which is about the only drawback, though for it's time it's pretty damn impressive.			",14,2,0,1,0,0,0

												If you like Star Wars and RPGs this game is a must have. An even if you only like RPGs you should still check it out. The Story is amazing and it actually feels like your actions have an impact on it and the world around you. While the whole combat mechanic may take a little getting used to it, once you have it down the fights are fun and can even be challenging sometimes if you are not utilising your characters the right way. While i have nearly no gametime on steam i had it as a regular game back in the days and played loads of it. And you can play the game ATLEAST twice to see how both Dark and Light side of the force play out but you can still try loads of different playstyles afterwards.			",32,4,0,2,4,0,9

												I am now 26 years old, twice as much as I was when I first played this game. I was already impressed with Bioware's Neverwinter Nights at the time, but the hundreds of hours I spent on KotOR really set the bar for all future RPGs for me. Features you love games like Jade Empire, Mass Effect, KotOR 2 and Dragon Age or even Arcanum, The Elder Scrolls and newer Fallouts for were pretty much all introduced to me by KotOR. A great soundtrack, deep companion stories, good/evil choices that make a difference in the storyline, plentiful side-quests, plot-twists, they're all there. This game was certain to become a classic the moment it hit the shelves in the second half of 2003.Definitely among The Essentials.			",45,23,0,11,6,0,6

												I know the game itself is great from playing it before, and that is why I would recommend it. Unfortunately, my version on this computer seems to not respond after the character creation screen, tried everything. *sigh* Definitely worth its price though, just to play the game.EDIT: Just seen a previous review about the same bug that was happening to me, solution worked!

Plus: The twist at the end is amazing.  This game has withstood the test of time, as it is one of my favorite games after ten years.  Seriously, I replay this game almost every year.

												10/10 would play a thousand times again.Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is a game that I would recommend for everyone and anyone to play. I've followed this game for years, from playing it on the xbox to buying the game and playing it here. This game has amazing replay quality, in depth character development (for you character and any other that you interact with), amazing variety in planets and spieces you can interact with, along with tough decisions and quick thinking. Anything you say or do can change everything and keeps you on your toes.Just because the game is old and the graphics aren't the best, don't judge the game just on that. You can invest hours upon hours into this game and never be bored. There are so many side quests to complete, each providing you with with more information about the galaxy and the conflict between the Sith and the Republic. Each time you go back to play you discover more and more quests that you missed the first time. You really can never get bored.So please, throw down the 10 bucks or less it costs, download it, play it, and love it. I swear you won't regret it :)			",30,26,0,9,1,2,1

												Like Star Wars? Like RPGs? Then you will love KOTOR.Don't be put off by it's age. I played it for the first time 12 years after it's release, and it's still great.Pros:- Rich story and great characters.- Fun and rewarding ""Powers"" and ""Skills"" system- You can choose different paths that changes the story- Dark side/Light side choices- MODS. There are 100s of Mods that enhance this game and give it so much replayability.Cons:- The graphics are painfully bad (though Mods help)- The controls and combat are very clunky and take some time to get used to.- Can be buggy, so you should save often.It's a great game. I picked it up on a whim for 10 bucks. Totally worth it!			",58,14,0,12,0,0,5

												It's KotoR... arguably one of the best RPG's in history of gaming, the gameplay (while old) is fun and engaging, the story is also very good, the skill progression is vast, and requires some forethought. The first character I ever made was a heavy gunner/Jedi ""consular"" (particularly adept at manipulating the force) I was pure darkside. While the play through is difficult with the set up I had it was extremely fun using it. I suggest this game to ANYONE who enjoys RPG's as far as I am concerned it is a MUST play. Buy it, if you don't want to pay the 9.99 wait for it to go on sale I got this and the second KOTOR for less than 4$.   (the 38.5 hrs on record is not my full time played... I have been playing since 2003 and and only recently got it through steam on sale, I have played this game more than I have played 99% of every other game I have.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Includes slight spoilers for some main and side-quests; I played through the game at least three times before I purchased it on Steam  Knights of the Old Republic - Review You are going to hate Knights of the Old Repbulic no matter how much enjoyment you gained from playing it. There is one simple reason for this: The moment the credits roll, you’re going to realize you just finished one of the best games ever made. And this can never be undone.4000 years before the battle of Yavin: You wake up aboard the Endar Spire amid a battle against a Sith-Fleet. Just like you, your character has no idea what the hell just happens and where he is. But behold, there is the unsung hero Trask Ulgo who is kind enough to explain the situation and the basics of the game. This is how the best Star Wars game ever created starts. From a modern point of view, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic might seem outdated. Its graphics pale in comparison to recent roleplaying games like the Mass Effect, The Wichter or the Dragon Age Series (all these titles are great in their own regard). But fancy graphics don't matter. KotOR puts heart and soul into its characters, plot and ultimately its dense atmosphere. And in one swift stroke BioWare pulls off what George Lucas never managed to do with the prequels: To tell a story of grand scale that is nonetheless personal and adventurous. Simply put, it creates a story that lives and breathes the original Star Wars. But you don’t need to be a huge Star Wars fan to adore this title as it is a great RPG, too. If you enjoyed Mass Effect or Dragon Age, KotOR is for you. The roots of the former titles can be traced back directly to the latter. Elements that were introduced in KotOR were later refined in these games. Your character is mute (just like in original Dragon Age). Every other character is fully synchronized. Some people are bothered by this and I can fully understand that but it offers the advantage that there are a lot more dialogue options than the recent BioWare-ian triad of “good”, “neutral” and “evil”. And, of course, this helps to bring some of the most memorable characters of video game history to life. You might’ve guessed it: The characters of this game are just amazingly well written. Every one of them brings something different to party. Every one of them is unique. And every one of them is memorable. I still can recall dialogues with every party member and that is no incident. Conversations are the beating heart of Knights of the Old Republic. Especially the ones with your crewmembers are excellent. Sometimes, they are dramatic. For example the quest that revolves around Bastila Shan’s parents. Other times they are hilariously funny – especially the conversations that involve a certain droid. Even the banter between your party members during missions is well written. BioWare manages to create some of the most beloved characters of the Star Wars Universe and with that they shaped the so called “Expanded Universe” for years to come. Credit must also be given to the beautiful voice acting by everyone involved. Naturally, this is also connected to the excellent storyline which offers one of the most shocking plot twists ever created. But truth to be told: The mission goals might get a bit repetitive during the mid-game. Nevertheless the steps to achieve the goal vary stark due to highly entertaining side-quests and level-design. For instance, during one main quest you are accused of a crime and have to defend yourself. If you do something wrong, they'll sentence you to death. In another mission you have to finish the training to become a Sith. Furthermore your quest leads you to highly diverse planets from the vast deserts of Tatooine to the tightly populated planet of Taris with its urban vibe that is reminiscent of Coruscant. The tremendous score by Jeremy Soule just enhances the experience - he carefully mashes up well-known tracks from John Williams with his own arrangements to create a unique soundtrack, that is deeply rooted in the realm of Star Wars compositions and yet highly distinguishable (listen to Bastila Shan's theme for reference).Besides the old-school-graphics, the gameplay probably discourages most people from picking it up. Admittedly, it’s slow as it is round based. That means you have choose an action your character takes after the enemy “finished his round”. It’s nothing like Mass Effect where you are actively aiming and shooting. If you want to boost the challenge, you stop using the pause button and choose an action for every party member. You don’t have to, though. The game is not very hard if you just want to enjoy the story. However, some boss fights can be really annoying on the first try.If you think about playing Knights of the Old Republic, do yourself a favor and just do it. You won’t be disappointed. If you generally like BioWare games or Star Wars you should play this as it was a defining game for the former and the latter. Tl;dr: KotOR combines a cast of great characters, a compelling story with some unpredictable twists and turns with polished gameplay. Conclusion: Play it, meatbag.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is a RPG any gamer can enjoy, a game that defined decision based conversation/character progression while employing real-time turn based combat and a story that will pull you in from the moment it begins, KOTOR is a game everyone should try at some point.Based around the time of the dark lords Revan & Malak and The Old Republic you will embark on a journey faced up against the might of the Sith Empire.Every companion has their own story and full length conversations throughout the game some will even grab the hearts of many fans just as much as the story does.

												Knights of the Old Republic is one of my top games of all time. I knew nothing about the game until it released, and picked up my first copy on the Xbox because it was Star Wars, and I liked Star Wars. At the time, I had no idea what I was getting myself into, but years later I look back at the few years I spent with this game as some of my golden gaming time. I've beaten the game with practically every party configuration and gone for every ending, torn through every sidequest, and I used to beat the game in one sitting. One particularly fond memory of mine involves picking it up one summer evening in high school and not stopping until the next evening when I was watching the end credits roll. I soon had a PC copy at my disposal and played it through some more. It was also the first piece of DLC I ever downloaded, Yavin Station for Xbox... which came natively with the PC version, since it was released later.All that aside, the game has both aged well as a great western RPG, but it hasn't aged well in the sense that it hardly cooperates with modern systems and it loves to act goofy, crash randomly, corrupt your saves, and sometimes just do inexplicable weird things. The port wasn't good back in the day, and it isn't good now. The controls are a bit funky, but they suffice... although the mouse/keyboard acts funny. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to get a controller working on it, and the game was definitely designed for a controller. If you want widescreen, prepare to either do some heavy ini editing, or download Flawless Widescreen... and even then, it's wonky and doesn't like to work properly all the time. When it works, though, KOTOR looks glorious and like it has hardly aged.The game was definitely an inspiration for the eventual Mass Effect, with a very similar overall feel to how the game flows, except the combat is a d20 DnD ruleset. It feels a little off, but once you get the hang of pausing battle to issue commands, it works great. My biggest gripe here is that unless you are micromanaging your party, they tend to do stupid things like pull the next pack of enemies down the hall while you're trying to recover. Speaking of managing your party, the game hardly gives you a reason to use non-jedi characters once you get them, although the single best reason to not have three Jedi in your party is HK-47... who is definitely worth having in your party as he is possibly one of the funniest video game characters of all time. Another party issue - [you must gather your party before venturing forth] is a message you're going to become very familiar with. There is also a ton of boring walking to do in this game, back and forth and back and forth... that used to be more normal, back in the day, to have a ton of walking from location to location in a game, but nowadays with things like fast travel cutting the general patience levels down, it can get boring when you have to walk very far to turn in a single sidequest for a paltry 200 XP.I also take a issue with the some of character building in this game... I'm going to warn you, don't waste points levelling up feats like blaster proficiency. This is one of those games that likes to give you a ton of options, but many of those options are ultimately useless and hinder your character later. It's tough to totally gimp yourself at least, but you can very easily waste a ton of points on things that absolutely do not matter.The story is the gold here; KOTOR tells an amazing tale with a fantastic twist and an ending that is rather satisfying. You can go for the Light Side or the Dark Side, and the game actually radically changes depending on whether or not you're Dark or Light. One of my favorite examples includes a mission early in the game where you can either help a widowed woman by buying an item her husband had hunted for her at an inflated price to give her a hand, or you can be evil and force persuade her to just give it to you. Some missions change entirely, such as either slaughtering an entire base full of people willing to help you, or gaining their trust and joining their side to help clean up the sewers.Overall, I think this is definitely worth checking out if you've never played it, but be ready to be patient, and keep multiple rotating saves. There are a ton of bugs here, sometimes the game will corrupt your save for no good reason, and sometimes you just might end up with an irreversible game-killing bug in the form of a friendly Galaxy Droid entering your ship. It's unfortunate that Bioware and EA have all but forgotten that these games exist, because they could definitely use a patch to make them more cooperative with Windows 7, widescreen resolutions, and generally not being a nuisance with modern machines. If you have played the game before, you know what to expect here. It's an amazingly wonderful western RPG, one that still stands as an excellent game over ten years after release.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great classic game that started a genre.The game breaks quite often.  Your player will lose the ability to walk.  That alone would make me say to get it on console.But this game is amazing, so working through that bullplop, still gives this game merit.I love the depth and the Jedi Lore. ",90,14,0,15,23,1,21

												Revan, Bastila, Carth, Mission, Zaalbar, Juhani, HK, Canderous, and Jolee would form the crew of the Ebon Hawk, and together, embark on a journey unlike any other in the Star Wars Universe. One that is a tale of friendship and hope. A saga of darkness and light. An examination of morality and corruption. A study of past sorrows giving way to future joys… all these things and more. Framed by the journeys of Revan, who wanted nothing more than to keep the galaxy and those he loved, safe. Together, the crew would endure the trials of Tatooine’s Dune Sea, uncover the mysteries of the Utopian society of Manaan, trudge through the thick worshyr forests of Kashyyk, and encounter, first hand, the power of the Dark side on the Sith academy of Korriban. Piece by piece, planet by planet, they would complete the Star map. And with it, their destinies as peacekeepers of the galaxyThank you Revan for a beautiful childhood,Thank you Bastila for showing how much the light side of human nature is stronger,Thank you Knights of the Old Republic			",31,4,0,3,4,0,3

												Knights of the Old Republic (KoTR) for short, is an epic Star Wars RPG that lives up to the name. This game plays as a bioware should, basic morality choices are the focus of dialouge and dice-rolling DnD style rules for the combat. Its deep enough to get lost in purely for the game itself, yet doesn't let this depth ruin the Star Wars immersion. Though a short story for RPG standards, its fufilling and satisfying. Its old, but its definately a staple in any good library.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I saw this review sitting here and wanted to flesh it out, so here is what I'll leave it.This game is amazing. If you want a good story with a wonderful plot that fits the star wars feel this is exactly the right game. It doesn't have much in the way of dialogue trees, but it makes up for it with an amazing story. I find myself going back seeing what content I missed last time or how I could do something differently.This game may not do anything new (besides a specific point in the plot I am not going to spoil) but it is a worth while game to play, especially since it leads into the second game. The series itself is well thought out and puts you in a wonderful DnD style world.My only issue with this game is the fact that getting it to work on modern PCs is a chore. Usually involving swapping out the MSS32.DLL file, disabling videos, and even patching the game to get it to run at a 16:9 aspect ratio. Regardless of this though, the game has withstood the test of time and I would (and have) recommend it to anyone who even asks about it.OLD REVIEW:This game has amazing graphics, can work on almost any machine, and has one of the best stories I've ever seen. This is a great game with a lot of replay value, and I would reccomend purchasing it. This game does have some trouble with Windows 7, and graphics cards with ATI Support, although it does not make the game unplayable.I would rate it:9.5/10			",97,18,1,8,8,2,9

												I don't know many hours this thing says I've played, but it's wrong. I got this game when steam didn't even exist and it is the epitome of what games ought to be: worth the damn money.Obviously it's Star Wars, so it's got that whole world going for it, even if it is now part of a disavowed canon. But beyond that there isn't a lot happening that was ground breaking for RPGs (maybe the decision based morality system, but I am not certain about that). So why should you buy it and play a thousand hours?The story.It's a compelling story of redemption if you want it to be. It's a compelling story of fate if you want it to be. It's just whatever you want it to be. Add in all the mods currently available and it is literally whatever you want it to be. Also, the restored content mod adds originally designed items and quests that got left out because LA loves to rush their♥♥♥♥♥♥to the market before it's finished.I mean, if you want to ""be a Jedi"", there are better games. Battlefront. Jedi Knight II. To an extent, the Force Unleashed series. All of these let you control more of the force powers and have something more akin to actual saber combat. But this game is all about the story:Sith versus Republic, a band of warriors brought together to fight for (or against) peace, and a mysterious stranger recruited to help defeat (or supplant) the Sith apprentice become master, Darth Malak. You travel to worlds across the galaxy in order to figure out how the Sith are building their fleet more quickly than the Republic can defeat them. And with the addition of the ""grey"" Jedi, those who are neither light nor dark, maybe you decide it's best to sweep away the remnants of the Galactic Republic and rule it yourself.I mean, it's not canon anymore anyway. Do what you want.Recommended Buy, but only on sale because it goes on sale so often. It's worth the extra money, but I believe in you and your ability to exercise self-control until it's 75% off.

												One of the greatest RPG's ever made, KoToR is not just that, but it'also the greatest Star Wars game ever made. It's a must play for Star Wars fans and Bioware fans. For Bioware fans, it's fairly similar in the formula of playing a character that is set on a task of saving the world/universe from the forces of evil, in this case, the Sith, while there is also the moral choice of following the dark side here, as well. But Bioware fans, more specifically, Mass Effect fans, will find it familiar for the numerous side quests, the collection of companions and taking two with you at a time. You get to a point where your companions travel through space with you on a ship and, like Mass Effect, the companions are located in various points of the ship.Yes, I know, this game came out years before Mass Effect, but not everyone played it back then, and it should still appeal to a mass audience now. I'm glad the game is on Steam, as there are ways to get the game to play in full 1080 HD/16:9. It involves editing text files and running a patch, but it works and shouldn't be an issue, if you know what you're doing.The plot, amazing. I shouldn't even have to talk about it. You play a soldier that wakes up in the middle of battle on a ship and you fight your way to the escape pods with your bunkmate. Along the way to escaping, you meet Carth, whom will become your closest ally for the rest of the game, and unfortunately, your bunkmate dies, sacrificing himself so you can escape. Carth, and yourself crashland on Taris in the escape pod, and from there, your wild adventure begins. From Taris, you find work, make money, figure out what's going on between the Republic and the Sith, meet various companions, the Big Z (a wookie) and Mission (a twi'lek). You meet the mercenary Canderous and eventually you get to learn how to race and finally, you meet Bastila, a Jedi who becomes your second closest companion.There are more companions in the game, but I'd be diving into the story and other planets. As for your character, you uncover the fact that you are strong in the force and train to become a Jedi. And soon, you're on a  mission to save the world from the evil Sith, and Darth Malak, a formidable foe, and one hell of a boss. (I died too many times on the final fight, prepare to have plenty of medpacs)Overall, this game was insanely awesome.10/10			",403,143,10,52,24,4,29

												As a big fan of the Star Wars Franchise I’ve delved into the expanded universe through reading some of the novel’s watching the movies and television shows and of course playing the games. As with the other Star Wars games I was very excited to try this one out. The title ‘Knights of the Old Republic’ just brought up fantasies of fighting with a lightsabers and force powers, exploring galaxies, and enjoying a deep and captivating narrative. I am happy to say that all of these fantasies came true. SWKOTOR is not only one of the most enjoyable Star Wars videogames, but it lands in my top five of videogames of all time.From start to finish the player is just captured by the World, characters and gameplay systems implemented in this RPG. You start off as a soldier, scout or scoundrel and end as a guardian, sentinel or a consular of the light side, dark side or even somewhere in between that. The story has a good twist near the end of it and is perfectly paced. The other characters in the game are fully realized, having their own backstories and missions, making this Star Wars experience so satisfying and engrossing.The combat system is smart and allows for a wide variety of strategies that will have to be thought out by you to emerge victorious. You are almost always allowed to have two other characters with you in a party as you explore the planets in the galaxy. You’re allowed to save your progress at any time and can talk to pretty much anybody. There are also two other side activities to do that are actually quite fun in addition to the side missions. The first of these side activities involves a card game called pazaak where you can win, or lose some credits. The second comes in the form of land speeder racing circuits which are available on three of the planets. You can also win a considerable amount of credits doing this. These credits can be spent at different stores and cantinas on weapon mods, armor enhancements and such. You can upgrade your weapons and armor via workbenches found around the world and on your ship, yes that’s right you get a ship, how else would you travel the galaxy at will? They thought of everything for this game and implemented it in the best way possible. If you love role playing games you should definitely set aside some time to play this, I have played this three to five times on the original Xbox and plan to play it some more on the PC, I strongly advise you to do the same on the PC since you’re reading this.This is my favourite RPG to Date, and possibly the best Star Wars game ever created.10/10I’d give it 11 if I could			",196,36,7,18,7,2,15

STAR WARS™: Knights of the Old Republic™ 
A Screenshot of STAR WARS™: Knights of the Old Republic™
By: Friedmudkips ツ #FreeMilo




The spectacular environments and areas that this game creates are absolutely unmatched. From the sprawling cities of Taris to the water-based metropolis of Manaan all the way to the Blood-red sands of Korriban this game has some breathtaking areas that I just cant do justice with words. No matter where you are there is always something to look at,something to see,or something to do. The characters also fit with where they are seamlessly.+WritingThis game has some absolutely phenomenal writing,from listening to a traitor give his passing words to and old friend all the way to hearing the hilarious jokes spewed from my meatbag-hating friend's grated mouth;this game has some incredibly memorable dialogue that will either demolish you with feels or leave you dying of laughter.+GameplayThis game uses a very tactical style of gameplay. You que up the actions of each of your 3 characters in the party and can also que different items such as energy shields to deflect blaster shots,or medpacks to heal grievous wounds. You'll end up needing all sorts of items like these to survive the toughest of fights in the late game. There are plenty of fights where you simply cannot win without some heavy thinking,using adrenals to buff your party, and using energy shields to absorb damage. This adds an element of intelligent planning before each fight. You cant just run in and play the game in real time,as even on easy this proves quite a challenge. You need to pause the game at the beggining of each encounter and think about how you are going to approach it.The boss fights in this game are incredibly well made,from suprises with bounty-hunters to encounters with hostile fleet command each encounter feels strategic and well thought out.+Character DevelopmentIn this game you play as Revan and the development of your character is astoundingly well done. You can either become a paragon of the light, or a beserker of the darkness.Either way by the end of the game you become a powerhouse,throwing your lightsaber to cut down any in your path or just straight up butchering them with dark side powers such as ""Death Field"" and ""Force Choke"". No matter what you do,the choices you make and the characters you influence,either through intimidation and threatening or persuasiveness and kindness,and your alignment with the force heavily influences the characters you meet and the ending you recieve.Cons-InventoryThe inventory is critical in an RPG and this one is pretty bad in multiple ways. First there is no semblance of order in the inventory screen. Everything seems to be ordered by type and even then im not sure about that. Ive had multiple occaisions where I pick up a datapad and have to scroll through my inventory,find the section of 5 items all named ""Datpad"",and find the new one.-CameraBoy this is the most infuriating camera I have ever had the displeasure of using. Trying to move around in close areas just ends up with the camera going all wack and you running around like a chicken with no head.-MovementMaybe its just the game being old but the movement in this game really aggravates me. Having to walk around instead of just turning around gets to be pretty annoying in tight quarters and the more enclosed areas. The movement in general just feels clunky as it is.If you found this review helpful or entertaining then feel free to join my Steam Curator Group at  Mudkips Gaming ",756,153,6,109,62,4,159

												This game is more Star Wars than most of the Star Wars movies. The story and characters and everything surrounding it is best experienced played, so buy it and play it already.Sure, the combat is a little dated, takes some getting used to, and has some infurating moments when you misclick, but it's weirdly fine having a real-time turn based game and fits well in most fights. The only real problems I had were near the end when I had no med packs and got bombarded by an absurd amount of sith but I got through eventually.Typical with most Bioware games, even before EA, there's a ton of choices that feel meaningful but you essentially get the same base story no matter what choice you make. I like this instead of vastly different outcomes because it means I only have to play the game two or three times to get the full choice effect, not 50 times to see every ending.Anyway buy this game, play it, love it, deny Disney when they say it's no longer part of the universe because to me this will always be.

												Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is an amazing game that truly takes my breath away. I played it not very long ago, after missing out on this beautiful masterpiece of a game. The opening scene that I was thrust into was amazing and action packed, with the 'Endar Spire' being bombed by the Sith. Once you escape there, you go to a planet known as Taris. That is by far the most annoying and agrivating part of the game. That's not in a bad way though, because the thing that makes it hard is it's sheer difficulty. If you choose the 'Soldier' class, this won't be much of a problem. However, if you're going for stealth or a balanced character, prepare to have your backside handed to you! That's about as far as I can go without spoiling the immersion of the fantastically crafted game.If you've never played this game... You've missed out on SO much!			",105,8,0,18,7,0,9

  Star Wars: Knights of The Old Republic  Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, or KOTOR, is by far one of the best games I have ever played. It has recieved over 40 Game of the Year awards, and it is what I believe to be one of the all time great RPGs. Basic Plot You start off by waking in a starship, the Endar Spire, under attack by the Sith Fleet that have bombarded the Republic. You will make your way to an escape, whilst fighting through Sith soldiers that have boarded the vessel, meeting two characters on the way, one of which is the war hero, Carth Onasi. You and Carth flee the ship and crash land on a nearby Planet, the urban world of Taris, where you will start your search for Bastila, a legendary Jedi without who the Republic would be all but finished.After you find Bastila, you and many other characters you meet on your way, travel to Dantooine once discovering a cunning plan to escape the Sith quarantine on the planet, due to the help of Canderous Ordo, an ex-mandalorian (Mandalore in KOTOR 2), in the nick of time as the Sith armada begin bombing the planet once they learn of Bastila's whereabouts on the surface.Once you reach Dantooine, the main plot is revealed and you set off travelling from system to sytem on your quest, which will lead up to an epic finale. Features The amount of detail is astonishing for a game that came out in 2003, and you will find no better storyline or characters anywhere else in the Star Wars Universe, and in my opinion, in any other RPG. The graphics are not amazing, but I believe that they are appealing and the game is extremely atmospheric, partially due to the great ambient music. The story is essentially linear, however you get to choose the path you take, what ending you will have, and your actions have influences on other characters and NPCs, which can often be very rewarding and satisfying.Few small glitches and bugs, and it has turned-based combat, which may not appeal to some, but offers a more strategical outlook on combat. Also, this game is relatively dialog-heavy, however it is extremely interactive, with little in the way of characters droning on and on.It is likely to take around 28 hours to complete the game first time, even for more experienced players due to the main story and sidequests. Pros & Cons Pros:-Amazing Story-Interesting Characters-Feel like you are in control, e.g. character influence, path choice-Strong atmosphere-Plenty of playtime-Great replayabilityCons:-Handful of annoying (but minor) bugs-Aged graphics Final Score -10/10 - Would get arrested on Manaan againOverall, the best £7.99 I have spent (I would have payed easily £60 for this, now I know what it is like). The screenshots really don't do it justice, and if you like excellent stories and/or Star Wars, play it.			",47,7,1,10,7,0,3

												Never played this game before but after hearing about this game, I just had to try it out. I mean all those positve reviews must have meant it was good right? Well, it was. After beating the game, I think the game overall was an amazing experience, even a game that is older than 10+ years ago still has me in a trance. It captivated me with it's storyline, characters (meatbag) and the choices of being able to choose whether to help the light side or dark side. I'm sure over time, I will still continue to play this game even after such a long time since its release. If you are a huge Star Wars fan, don't be shy!			",61,24,0,9,9,1,11

												I have to say I am not the biggest Star Wars fan nor am I a big RPG fan but it is amazing! Sublime! 10/10! The only problem is that the graphics have not really aged well but if you only play a game for its' graphics hope you have the same fate as Captain Needa. But no apologies. But anyway; if you want a game to forget what Earth is like then get this game. Back to the graphics people... stay on Taris... in the undercity.			",190,70,3,27,30,2,14

												I played this game when I was like 4 or 5, and I will admit I didn't get passed the second mission.

												10/10 would play a thousand times again.Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is a game that I would recommend for everyone and anyone to play. I've followed this game for years, from playing it on the xbox to buying the game and playing it here. This game has amazing replay quality, in depth character development (for you character and any other that you interact with), amazing variety in planets and spieces you can interact with, along with tough decisions and quick thinking. Anything you say or do can change everything and keeps you on your toes.Just because the game is old and the graphics aren't the best, don't judge the game just on that. You can invest hours upon hours into this game and never be bored. There are so many side quests to complete, each providing you with with more information about the galaxy and the conflict between the Sith and the Republic. Each time you go back to play you discover more and more quests that you missed the first time. You really can never get bored.So please, throw down the 10 bucks or less it costs, download it, play it, and love it. I swear you won't regret it :)			",30,26,0,9,1,2,1

												KOTOR is a great game with an amazing story and character development as well as solid voice acting. Bioware has been crafting these aspects of games right for a long time. This game also has a stellar sense of environment for its time in regards to the planets you visit: each area has a distinctive and memorable atmosphere and adjoining characters. The music, geography, encounters, and side-quests all make each area an amazing experience on its own.The component that makes this game a must-own and a classic, however, is its story. The fact that you have true agency over certain situations through dialogue is engaging and makes for a unique gaming experience. The parts of the story that you don't have control over still create such a compelling narrative that truly inhibits emotion - something that many games tend to lack.While no one needs another review to confirm that this game is a classic worthy of any and everyone's library, another voice to support is always helpful.

 ONE OF THE BEST RPGS OF ALL TIME	In short, KOTOR is a legend. A game that you should buy just to witness the story. It has a well deserved place in my TOP10 best games of all time list. Search for TOP10 RPGs of all times and you will see KOTOR there in any list that is worth mentioning.Like all Bioware games, this game  heavily relies on the story. You wake up in a ship that is under attack and from that on try to save your own skin. On the way you meet good friends on different planets who have rich background stories on their own. 3 of the characters in this game found a place in the Most Popular Star Wars Characters of all time list by Lucas Arts Fans. Especially you will have incredible moments with HK-47. There are usually many ways to complete guests and depending on your actions the future of people and even nations change in the end.WARNING. Dont read any spoilers about this game before your first playthrough. There is a moment in the game that is selected The Most JAW BREAKING MOMENT of all time. It is such a moment that made me stop playing the game because of the shock and made me think how that is possible for a week.Fighting is amazing. There are 3 classes which effect your play stile a lot. Soldier is the typical fighter class while others are a little different. You are a jedi but you are allowed to focus on guns with high dexterity. You can queue 3 actions for each character while fighting for an easier management. I remember the easy difficulty was too easy so avoid that unless you are only into the story.I still love the graphics and the soundtrack is a piece of art. Character voices are very well done. I am still inlove with Jennifer Hale as the voice of Bastila Shan and it still makes me smile remember HK-47 saying MEATBAGs.In conclusion if you are a RPG fun, its highly likely that you already bought the game. If not, then this is the game that willl make you a RPG and Bioware fan.  Graphics 88   Music/sounds 95   Gameplay 90   Story 100   Replayability 90   OVERALL 98  ",88,21,1,28,5,0,27

												Great game- loved it. Got it on Saturday and I've spent 24hrs on it already (Tuesday on day of writing).Story is great did not see the twist coming and made me really involved in the story.The choices you make actually change the story!! Already replaying it to do the light side ending...13 year old game graphics are a bit vintage a bit like GTA SA (play it if you haven't!!).I was pretty happy with the gameplay. But I think you can mod both of those things anyway as well as adding widescreen compatibility (which I did and I have no idea with how to mod things...). Find a youtube vid on it!Playing on Windows 10  with 2 GB RAM and 1.33 GHz, I know cute little system properties.Only got  crashes untill I added AllowwindowedMode=1 under the [Graphics Options] in the swotor config settings file (it opens up as a .txt file in the steamapps/common/swkotor bit.

												Disregarding the frequent crashes because the steam version is well, aids, the game is incredibly enjoyable and the story is one of the best. It is certainly one of BioWare's greatest games and I enjoy the series overall. I started playing these games rather late, but it was worth the praise I heard it getting. My only problem, is ofcourse, the frequent crashings, the inability to interact with the game world at certain points and the black screen, otherwise, an amazing game.			",18,2,0,16,3,0,3

												This game is the BEST Star Wars game I have ever played, my favorite to say. You get to choose your own destiny. Becoming a hero, or a villain. This game makes you feel like you are in the game. The story is great, even though it takes place 4000 years before the movies.So many colorful casts and rich enviroment.One of the best RPGs I have played.This is what the fans needed.

												A very, very, very good game, great value for money and definately worth a buy. A unique story and a brand new set of characters makes it a breath of fresh air for even the most dedicated Star Wars fans, and it keeps you guessing with it's fair share of plot twists. It's also a great RPG on top of that. It's easy to get to grips with the mechanics and if you manage to get a few hours into the game the story really starts to develop, and the fact that it's a great RPG in itself makes it playable and understandable by even those who don't know much or even anything about the Star Wars universe. In my opinion, and many others, it's the best Star Wars game ever made, and one of the best RPGs. 10/10			",59,7,0,6,11,2,5

												Well, this is THE BEST STAR WARS GAME to get, it has it all, compelling story, awesome (and well developed) characters and combat (even if it is a bit clunky and old dated, i still quite rather enjoyed it), that ending was phenomenal, but because this game is old and there was not many software updates, the game brings some bugs to the table, at my case, i didn't had many eccounters with them, but when i had... Darth Malak seemed like a nice guy to talk with, my 30 hour save got corrupted right when i was going to face him... Though i still beaten the game, that experience made me not want to play it a second time, fearing that what happened to me in the first time would repeat, i would still say that you MUST buy this game if you are a Star Wars fan..

												Great game- loved it. Got it on Saturday and I've spent 24hrs on it already (Tuesday on day of writing).Story is great did not see the twist coming and made me really involved in the story.The choices you make actually change the story!! Already replaying it to do the light side ending...13 year old game graphics are a bit vintage a bit like GTA SA (play it if you haven't!!).I was pretty happy with the gameplay. But I think you can mod both of those things anyway as well as adding widescreen compatibility (which I did and I have no idea with how to mod things...). Find a youtube vid on it!Playing on Windows 10  with 2 GB RAM and 1.33 GHz, I know cute little system properties.Only got  crashes untill I added AllowwindowedMode=1 under the [Graphics Options] in the swotor config settings file (it opens up as a .txt file in the steamapps/common/swkotor bit.

Since then, I've been desperatly searching for a way to play it without buying another Xbox. Finally, the answer came. I built my own gaming computer, and got this game as soon as I could.Bioware always presents us with beautiful games full of in depth story and great characters, and KOTOR is one of the greatest. Even today, with all the amazing next generation graphics coming out with vantastic games like Witcher 3, Fallout 4, Uncharted 4, etc., KOTOR remains great. It is one of a kind and absolutely.....perfect!			",113,9,0,13,9,0,3

 ONE OF THE BEST RPGS OF ALL TIME	In short, KOTOR is a legend. A game that you should buy just to witness the story. It has a well deserved place in my TOP10 best games of all time list. Search for TOP10 RPGs of all times and you will see KOTOR there in any list that is worth mentioning.Like all Bioware games, this game  heavily relies on the story. You wake up in a ship that is under attack and from that on try to save your own skin. On the way you meet good friends on different planets who have rich background stories on their own. 3 of the characters in this game found a place in the Most Popular Star Wars Characters of all time list by Lucas Arts Fans. Especially you will have incredible moments with HK-47. There are usually many ways to complete guests and depending on your actions the future of people and even nations change in the end.WARNING. Dont read any spoilers about this game before your first playthrough. There is a moment in the game that is selected The Most JAW BREAKING MOMENT of all time. It is such a moment that made me stop playing the game because of the shock and made me think how that is possible for a week.Fighting is amazing. There are 3 classes which effect your play stile a lot. Soldier is the typical fighter class while others are a little different. You are a jedi but you are allowed to focus on guns with high dexterity. You can queue 3 actions for each character while fighting for an easier management. I remember the easy difficulty was too easy so avoid that unless you are only into the story.I still love the graphics and the soundtrack is a piece of art. Character voices are very well done. I am still inlove with Jennifer Hale as the voice of Bastila Shan and it still makes me smile remember HK-47 saying MEATBAGs.In conclusion if you are a RPG fun, its highly likely that you already bought the game. If not, then this is the game that willl make you a RPG and Bioware fan.  Graphics 88   Music/sounds 95   Gameplay 90   Story 100   Replayability 90   OVERALL 98  ",88,21,1,28,5,0,27

												The first of two classic sci-fi RPGs that birthed the creation of the popular MMO, it had great graphics and gameplay for it's time.  Combat tends to follow D&D type rules while still providing action-packed fight scenes.  It tends to follow the set formula of most Bioware RPGs (generic hero with obscure origins and special abilities thrust into an on-going war of good vs. evil, add morality meter and companions, etc.), but contains a number of plot twists and a hefty dose of Star Wars lore.  Both the MC and his/her companions tend to expereicne significant character development as the story progresses, a portion of which the player can influence, leading to some intresting scenes and dialogue in-game.  All in all a classic title, and a must-have for those who wish to delve further into those events that helped shape the world setting of SW:tOR the MMO.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												PROS:+Excellent story. By far the best in any video game in my opinion next to the first Deus Ex. Also has a bunch of unexpected and genius twists that kick you in the balls and make you say ""What the hell?""+Brilliant yet simple combat system based on the D&D dice roll system.+Lots of customization for you and your crew.+Lovable characters that you actually see develop through in-game dialogue selections(except Juhani)+Decent graphics for a 2003 game.+The planets you visit are diverse and extremely fun to explore.+Large range of weapons and powers+Light side and dark side alignment choices are present (you can be a saint or a♥♥♥♥♥♥ your choice).+Has HK-47, the slyest and murderous son(or droid?) of a gun that you MUST purchase when you're in Tatooine if you want to laugh all the way to your final fight with Darth Malak. Also has Jolee, the sterotypical old black man that makes you crack up at his sarcastic antics.+Mods support, but why modify an already amazing game,CONS:-Lots of bugs.-Pazaak, the most unfair and unbalanced variation of the game Blackjack/21-Podracing gets old.-Juhani, the most emo character in Star Wars history. I half expected her to burst out singing ""Crawling.""To be honest who gives a damn about the cons. Just get this game if you want to immerse yourself into a 50 hour campaign of lightsaber duels, firefights, well rounded characters(except for you-know-you) and the best Star Wars story, hell even the best story in a video game.10/10			",132,19,4,14,5,1,7

												Unlike most, this is a review coming from someome who never played this game until a few days ago.MAN! Even though I never played this game as a kid, I wish I had. I let this game slip my mind constantly for years until finally purchasing it last week. Pros:-Amazing story, with a twist around every corner.-Great yet simple combat system (Especially for 2003).-Interesting group of potential companions, most of whom have an interesting backstory.-Beautiful scenery, even though the quality is a little low there are many sights to behold on each of the 7 planets.-The ability to CHOOSE your side, and ending light or dark side.Cons: -Companion A.I. can get a bit clunky and frustrating as sometimes they'll run and attack someone far away when you're clearly trying to go the opposite direction.-Enemy A.I. will sometimes glitch and stand still, allowing you to attack them until they die. (Not really a con in most cases ;))Overall this game made me feel like a kid again, which is something I've never been able to say about any other video game. Would absolutely recommend to ANYONE who is interested in video games and Star Wars.P.S. F*ck you Manaan for banning me from your planet.Love,An angry Sith Lord			",24,2,0,4,0,0,1

												Over 10 years later and this game is still well worth the money. The combat is a little dated and might take some getting used to but the story, companion characterization and voice acting are top notch. Each area feels new and unique and you can feel the progression of your character as you move through the story.If you  have managed to avoid major plot points thus far I strongly recommend not reading anything else about the game. You're in for a fun ride.I had a couple of minor technical issues running this on Windows 10 but if you don't mind doing a couple quick google searches for problems you encounter (controlled character getting stuck after combat, ect.) you should have a relatively easy time.If you are someone who gets hung up on aesthetics (the game came out in 2003, cut it some slack) or are unwilling to do basic type and click research this may not be the game for you as you most likely will have to fiddle with some of the graphic settings to get things running smoothly.

A really, really long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...STAR WARS - KNIGHTS OF THE OLD REPUBLICRIP Star Wars EU (1977-2015)If the Star Wars Galaxy represented the old canon, the EU would be the Outer Rim. Unstable, conflicting, weird and somehow able to be amazing or downright terrible at times, the Old EU always has been a ""Wild West"", Outer-Rim of sorts where content quality was in the hands of outside contributors, many of them with no other reason than to make a few quick credits by flashing some yellow crawl text and John Williams fanfare before the drivel that they push out.Enter Disney, AKA The Galactic Empire, bringing law and order to the far reaches of the galaxy with its crack team of licensing and merchandising agents, reining back in the Star Wars creative universe with a heavily copyrighted iron fist. Now, with the scum of the galaxy flushed out of the airlock, and the original trilogy hoisted again upon a pedestal, supported by the raging hard nerdboners of millions of OT fanboys, we have peace.But forget not the glory days of the Old Republic.Knights of The old Republic, along with other works such as The Zahn trilogy felt like unessecary casualties of an overzealous purge by Disney. Although many absolute stinkers deserved to be booted from the canon, some of them were legitimately worthy of taking on the Star Wars name as extensions of the stories told in the movies.Star Wars' story has always been motifs and plot points that repeat and echo throughout the whole saga. It's like poetry, y'know. They rhyme. KOTOR is no stranger to that. On the surface, its story is the story of Star Wars, of a chosen one destined to bring balance to the force, defeat the baddies, get the girl and save the day!The game plays like an old fashioned, traditional rpg. Having never played any of Bioware's older rpgs, I found the gameplay to be really dated which lessens the fun somewhat. Case in point, the only direct player actions in combat are basically selecting a target and queuing up your attack orders or force powers, everything else being a dice roll. The user interface is clunky, with too much data hidden behind too many buttons and menu screens that draws the player away from the game. However, I cannot fault the game for simply being old, spoiled as I have by more polished and refined mechanics from newer titles.Where the game truly shines is the role playing and story.  Being a Bioware RPG, you start from a central hub, first a planet, later your starship, where you can select your party and choose to travel to different locations. You can pursue the main story by visiting any number of different planets, all of them giving off the distinct feeling of a unique place in the Star Wars galaxy. The characters that you meet along the way, your party members, all have a story to tell, and the choices you make reflect who you truly are. The plot heavily revolves around the concept of discovering who you are, and what you are versus what you want to be. Every quest decision and interaction with other characters affects not only their perception and relationship with you, but also your own morality. The game employs a meter that starts you off in the middle and every decision you make skews you towards either the light or the dark side. I absolutely love the option of either being a goody-two-lightsabers light side jedi or being a ruthless, Revangeful Dark Lord.Although the game was fantastic when it first released, does it still make sense to get KOTOR today? It's a given that its dated combat, graphics and gameplay cannot hold a candle to later RPGS like The Witcher or even Bioware's own Mass Effect series. However, if you are an avid fan of Star Wars, I would definitely say yes, just for the experience of being a Jedi or Sith, choosing the Light side or the Dark, in hands-down the best story experience ever in a Star Wars game.Which makes it in my eyes the second-best Star Wars game of all time.

												I have to say this game aged well. The game is easily as immersive as more modern RPGs like Skyrim and The Witcher. It's also cool to see the impact TRPGs had on early RPGs.			",130,19,3,9,17,0,16

												Took me 28 h to finish the game as a Dark Side jedi and i havent done all the side quest ( cuz im a bad and i dont give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about people in distress ). Even for an old game the graphics are really good and I was stunned by the action scene/fighting of the game they are really well made. The Dialogues are very complete and in a lot of ways you can change the course of action ( force persuade is a must its so fun ). But the best of this game is that you do feel like a Jedi while playing and you can play a Sith if you want, choices does a difference aswell.			",124,8,0,12,16,2,6

The combat is a little strange, but I got that pretty fast when I was able to use a lightsaber.  Though rushed and partially unfinished this game proves to be a stellar addition to any Star Wars fan's library.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, this is THE BEST STAR WARS GAME to get, it has it all, compelling story, awesome (and well developed) characters and combat (even if it is a bit clunky and old dated, i still quite rather enjoyed it), that ending was phenomenal, but because this game is old and there was not many software updates, the game brings some bugs to the table, at my case, i didn't had many eccounters with them, but when i had... Darth Malak seemed like a nice guy to talk with, my 30 hour save got corrupted right when i was going to face him... Though i still beaten the game, that experience made me not want to play it a second time, fearing that what happened to me in the first time would repeat, i would still say that you MUST buy this game if you are a Star Wars fan.. And these days, who isn't right?			",36,8,1,7,0,0,1

												I got this game from my grandma for Christmas when it released. I never really had any experience with RPG games and I was really young but I could understand the dialogue well enough to love it. I'm still very young today but back then, the game felt so epic and HUGE! I felt like each planet would take days to finish when in reality it only took a few hours. This was the only game I would ever play, I had to have replayed it over 40+ times and this isn't an exaggeration! Once KOTOR 2 came out I just had to get it, the game was fun but not as memorable as KOTOR 1. I remember being actually scared at points in this game. When I arrived to Malachor V, I literally was frightened to play it. The atmosphere and music was so grim and well done! Yesterday, I found my original XBOX along with both games, I checked my save files and WOW, did I play a lot of this game. The music is so nostalgic and a masterpiece! I decided to replay both games and it still holds up today as my favorite game of all time! KOTOR will forever be in my heart.﻿ I could write an entire 5 page essay on the game because of so much more I have to say about it. But I'll leave it at this, and I highly highly encourage you to try out this game. It may seem kind of stale to todays standards, but back then, it was next-gen. This was the only game that I played in my childhood, and I probably played it for 4 years straight without ever getting bored of it. Please give this game a chance and even the sequel the same. One other thing I would like to mention is how emotionally invested in the characters you can get into this game. I was attatched to multiple characters and they felt like they were my friends in real life. I haven't ever had this feeling until recently, with the masterpiece ""The Witcher 3"", and honestly, it's amazing.			",47,1,0,4,1,0,1

												This game has been around for quite a few years now. It is one of the best RPG's out there, along with it's sequel, and hands down a must-play if you are a Star Wars fan!Currently, the movement can be a bit buggy. I don't recall this as an issue when I played it back on Windows XP years ago, but simply switching to one of your other controllable characters allows the other character to move out of the terrain glitch. I have only had the very rare crash so far in 20 hours of gameplay (I think twice). This game has a decent story, and plenty of weaponry to choose from. It allows both melee and ranged (blaster/bowcaster) gameplay, and the combat is turn-based in real-time, while still pausable at any time in the game to allow control of your characters and their combat options. There are times when you might come across a group of enemies to eliminate, during which your first attempt might end in complete failure, and minimal losses to the enemy; whereby approaching with a different strategy / different abilities, you may not lose a single companion, and find the fight much easier. Such is the combat mechanic depth.Graphics I can't say much about due to it's age, but they are good enough on the Steam version of this game to at least scale somewhat to to a widescreen configuration. In other words, the game is very playable (albeit not with the graphical content or depth of, say, Assasin's Creed).Absolute 10/10And if you enjoy this game and it's playstyle, then absolutely recommended is the sequel!!!! Happy Gaming!			",99,9,1,5,21,0,14

												I've been a fan of Star Wars for many years, and I've played many of the franchise's games. Some of them provide excellent action ('Republic Commando', 'Jedi Academy'), but none of them are memorable in the way that 'Knights of the Old Republic' is. In fact, the only Star Wars game which I think approaches it in terms of quality is its sequel. The premise of 'KOTOR' is fairly simple: You play a soldier whose mission it is to stop a powerful Sith Lord, and in order to do so you have to find several components of an ancient map. It may sound like a cliché RPG, but on your travels you'll encounter so many interesting people, fascinating stories and incredible quests, you'll never want it to end. I know I didn't.

												Alright I have finally put 100 hours into the steam version of this game and countless more back when I had this game on the xbox. About time I leave a review.This game was a massive part of my childhood growing up as I would always play it growing up. I had never really played an RPG style game such as Kotor before and have hardly played any others afterwards and was mainly only interested in the game for its connection to Star Wars. However, rpg experience grew on me and I really enjoyed the turn-based combat and roleplay aspects and would reccommend this game to the rpg fan and/or the casual Star Wars fan.One of the reasons I enjoyed this game and have replayed it many times (and will likely continue to do so) was the story and the characters which were an excellent part of the game.The graphics for this game are not bad despite being from 2003 (ok they are a little dated... but not bad at all)Now the game has been known to have some issues with some minor bugs and crashes and it can sometimes be hard to start the game but there many fixes that can be found on the internet from people who possibly have run into a similar problem that you could experience. Just remember to save often and in different slotsSummary:Story = GoodCharacters = GoodMusic = GoodGraphics = FineReplayability = Hell YeahHope this was helpful :)			",5,1,0,2,2,0,3

												It's KotoR... arguably one of the best RPG's in history of gaming, the gameplay (while old) is fun and engaging, the story is also very good, the skill progression is vast, and requires some forethought. The first character I ever made was a heavy gunner/Jedi ""consular"" (particularly adept at manipulating the force) I was pure darkside. While the play through is difficult with the set up I had it was extremely fun using it. I suggest this game to ANYONE who enjoys RPG's as far as I am concerned it is a MUST play. Buy it, if you don't want to pay the 9.99 wait for it to go on sale I got this and the second KOTOR for less than 4$.   (the 38.5 hrs on record is not my full time played... I have been playing since 2003 and and only recently got it through steam on sale, I have played this game more than I have played 99% of every other game I have.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

At the price of 10$ (on sale is usually 5$), it's an amazing game for that price. Hours of gameplay and lots of customization is this the Grandfather of RPGs. Very interesting and still maintains that feel of ""Every choice matters"".

Posted: January 24
												This is an attempt to make a spoiler free review from a modern perspective for people unsure as to whether to purchase the game and are unfamiliar with it, but it is, of course, my own opinion, and an informed consumer should look at multiple reviews before buying.Gameplay: The game follows a D&D style turn based combat system, which can either be fun or needlessly boring depending on your preference. It is not a very difficult game to beat, either. Most enemies are there for the sake of being there to slow you down and/or give you something to do. Difficult fights that require you to scratch your head and mix up your approach are few and far between. Don't get me wrong, that does not necessarily make this an unenjoyable experience, but those who wish for a challenge will be dissapointed. In between combat you will focus mostly on dialogue (WARNING: there is A LOT of dialogue in this game; if you are not a fan of listening or reading lots of text, it is unlikely that you will appreciate this game very much), though you will probably also be doing quite a bit of inventory management and min-maxing of equipment, too. Skills in this game are usually used to aid in combat or dialogue (i.e. repairing droids to help in fights, using persuade to get more money out of a quest that you were given, etc...) Apart from that there are several optional mini-games but that about sums up what you actually do.NOTE: It's very useful if you go into this game knowing how basic D&D or D20 RPG systems operate so you understand what all the stats mean. You might have some trouble getting a grasp of the systems without knowing anything about that.IMPORTANT NOTE: This game has difficulty running on anything newer than Windows XP. It's probable you'll have to do some troubleshooting to fix issues playing the game, especially with cutscenes.Story and Quests: The main story in KOTOR is good,  but is unlikely to be that life-changing or awe inspiring for anyone, and its big twist can be seen coming for some time if the player has been paying close enough attention to all the dialogue and story thus far. The main plot also begins rather slowly and takes quite a bit of time to develop. This is not the game for the impatient and easily bored. Sidequests typically are, again, good, but not great. There are some real gems in there, though. I mean, it's a Bioware game. Perhaps the biggest strike against it is the binary morality system. You tend to either be the nicest and most compassionate person in the galaxy, or be a psychotic space Hitler. That being said, the game is classic Star Wars in design, so it's likely that is purposeful, but you should still be aware you are unlikely to be morally or ethically challenged or questioned in any way during this game (very much unlike its sequel, KOTOR 2).Characters: I'm giving this its own section because I feel like it deserves it. Optional party member quests and dialogue are a large part of this games overall story. Most party members in KOTOR are not particularly interesting, and it's likely you'll only do the backstories for characters you do find interesting. But most of this is entirely optional, so it doesn't really count as a strike against the game, and is a nice addition.Sound: Music is by Jeremy Soule so of course it's good. It is not classic John Williams, however. Take that as you will. It can either be good or bad.Graphics: Very dated. I don't feel the urge to go into greater detail as you can just look at screenshots above.Aesthetic: It is mostly bright and colorful without overdoing it. Nothing particularly stands out here. It's vibrant where it wants to be vibrant and dark where it wants to be dark. I don't really have anything to compare it to. Again, I recommend just looking at screenshots.Conclusion: It's a very good game, and definitely worth playing if you enjoy this style of combat and are patient enough with the story. You don't even need to be into Star Wars to have a lot of fun with this game.TL;DR: It's a quintessential Star Wars story (albeit a very slow paced one) mixed with D&D style gameplay and sidequests. If that sounds like something you'd like, you will probably enjoy this game. Be aware that if you try to run it on anything newer than Windows XP you can have problems, especially with the cutscenes. You may have to do some troubleshooting to get it to work.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unlike most, this is a review coming from someome who never played this game until a few days ago.MAN! Even though I never played this game as a kid, I wish I had. I let this game slip my mind constantly for years until finally purchasing it last week. Pros:-Amazing story, with a twist around every corner.-Great yet simple combat system (Especially for 2003).-Interesting group of potential companions, most of whom have an interesting backstory.-Beautiful scenery, even though the quality is a little low there are many sights to behold on each of the 7 planets.-The ability to CHOOSE your side, and ending light or dark side.Cons: -Companion A.I. can get a bit clunky and frustrating as sometimes they'll run and attack someone far away when you're clearly trying to go the opposite direction.-Enemy A.I. will sometimes glitch and stand still, allowing you to attack them until they die. (Not really a con in most cases ;))Overall this game made me feel like a kid again, which is something I've never been able to say about any other video game. Would absolutely recommend to ANYONE who is interested in video games and Star Wars.P.S. F*ck you Manaan for banning me from your planet.Love,An angry Sith Lord			",24,2,0,4,0,0,1

One that is a tale of friendship and hope. A saga of darkness and light. An examination of morality and corruption. A study of past sorrows giving way to future joys… all these things and more. Framed by the journeys of Revan, who wanted nothing more than to keep the galaxy and those he loved, safe. Together, the crew would endure the trials of Tatooine’s Dune Sea, uncover the mysteries of the Utopian society of Manaan, trudge through the thick worshyr forests of Kashyyk, and encounter, first hand, the power of the Dark side on the Sith academy of Korriban. Piece by piece, planet by planet, they would complete the Star map. And with it, their destinies as peacekeepers of the galaxyThank you Revan for a beautiful childhood,Thank you Bastila for showing how much the light side of human nature is stronger,Thank you Knights of the Old Republic			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The only downside i could say is that sometimes it can be a little buggy running on newer versions of windows since it is so old.

												Ok, the first time I played this back on Xbox, I didn't like the game.  I got used to button smash, hack and slash gameplay that I wasn't able to appreciate this game. I was young, I was stupid, and how wrong I was to not give this game a chance.This is my third playthrough, (the first two, I didn't even managed to play it for 2 hours and wasn't on steam), and HOLY MOTHER OF MERCY how good this game is.   The atmosphere, the feeling, and the twist, though I was spoiled on multiple occasions, but it is still good.  I'm not a fan of dice combat system, but somewhat I did not mind this on this game.  My thoughts right now are so scrambled because of how great this game makes you feel.  The environment is greatly implemented witrh complimentary colors.  The music is great, and it really makes you feel great playing as the Light Side Jedi, but nonetheless, this game has flaws sadly :(One great flaw are the bugs, it still is a buggy game, there are quest that you can't finish (you might need a save editor to finish it) and it sucks playing as the dark side.  I feel like they just throw that in for laughs, it's funny playing as the dark side jedi, but it doesn't give you the feel like you are bad at all.  Sometimes you get stuck, good thing for switching to other characters which helps fix that bug, videos are outdated, and yea. Idk, anyway it is a must buy play game.  I regretted not playing this throughly before and I'm happy I'm almost done with the game (beating LS side). It has a lot of replayablility if you are willing to try all the classes and which one works for you and etc. Anyway, one big tip is to read some guides for an easier battle and just enjoy the story it provides.I didn't read any guides and just keep placing feats and powers to my whim and I had difficulty in certain missions, you also had to control all 3 characters like you do on Dragon Age or you'll have a bad time.  Like I said, read guides first it helps to be honest.			",44,8,0,6,1,0,0

 Includes slight spoilers for some main and side-quests; I played through the game at least three times before I purchased it on Steam  Knights of the Old Republic - Review You are going to hate Knights of the Old Repbulic no matter how much enjoyment you gained from playing it. There is one simple reason for this: The moment the credits roll, you’re going to realize you just finished one of the best games ever made. And this can never be undone.4000 years before the battle of Yavin: You wake up aboard the Endar Spire amid a battle against a Sith-Fleet. Just like you, your character has no idea what the hell just happens and where he is. But behold, there is the unsung hero Trask Ulgo who is kind enough to explain the situation and the basics of the game. This is how the best Star Wars game ever created starts. From a modern point of view, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic might seem outdated. Its graphics pale in comparison to recent roleplaying games like the Mass Effect, The Wichter or the Dragon Age Series (all these titles are great in their own regard). But fancy graphics don't matter. KotOR puts heart and soul into its characters, plot and ultimately its dense atmosphere. And in one swift stroke BioWare pulls off what George Lucas never managed to do with the prequels: To tell a story of grand scale that is nonetheless personal and adventurous. Simply put, it creates a story that lives and breathes the original Star Wars. But you don’t need to be a huge Star Wars fan to adore this title as it is a great RPG, too. If you enjoyed Mass Effect or Dragon Age, KotOR is for you. The roots of the former titles can be traced back directly to the latter. Elements that were introduced in KotOR were later refined in these games. Your character is mute (just like in original Dragon Age). Every other character is fully synchronized. Some people are bothered by this and I can fully understand that but it offers the advantage that there are a lot more dialogue options than the recent BioWare-ian triad of “good”, “neutral” and “evil”. And, of course, this helps to bring some of the most memorable characters of video game history to life. You might’ve guessed it: The characters of this game are just amazingly well written. Every one of them brings something different to party. Every one of them is unique. And every one of them is memorable. I still can recall dialogues with every party member and that is no incident. Conversations are the beating heart of Knights of the Old Republic. Especially the ones with your crewmembers are excellent. Sometimes, they are dramatic. For example the quest that revolves around Bastila Shan’s parents. Other times they are hilariously funny – especially the conversations that involve a certain droid. Even the banter between your party members during missions is well written. BioWare manages to create some of the most beloved characters of the Star Wars Universe and with that they shaped the so called “Expanded Universe” for years to come. Credit must also be given to the beautiful voice acting by everyone involved. Naturally, this is also connected to the excellent storyline which offers one of the most shocking plot twists ever created. But truth to be told: The mission goals might get a bit repetitive during the mid-game. Nevertheless the steps to achieve the goal vary stark due to highly entertaining side-quests and level-design. For instance, during one main quest you are accused of a crime and have to defend yourself. If you do something wrong, they'll sentence you to death. In another mission you have to finish the training to become a Sith. Furthermore your quest leads you to highly diverse planets from the vast deserts of Tatooine to the tightly populated planet of Taris with its urban vibe that is reminiscent of Coruscant. The tremendous score by Jeremy Soule just enhances the experience - he carefully mashes up well-known tracks from John Williams with his own arrangements to create a unique soundtrack, that is deeply rooted in the realm of Star Wars compositions and yet highly distinguishable (listen to Bastila Shan's theme for reference).Besides the old-school-graphics, the gameplay probably discourages most people from picking it up. Admittedly, it’s slow as it is round based. That means you have choose an action your character takes after the enemy “finished his round”. It’s nothing like Mass Effect where you are actively aiming and shooting. If you want to boost the challenge, you stop using the pause button and choose an action for every party member. You don’t have to, though. The game is not very hard if you just want to enjoy the story. However, some boss fights can be really annoying on the first try.If you think about playing Knights of the Old Republic, do yourself a favor and just do it. You won’t be disappointed. If you generally like BioWare games or Star Wars you should play this as it was a defining game for the former and the latter. Tl;dr: KotOR combines a cast of great characters, a compelling story with some unpredictable twists and turns with polished gameplay. Conclusion: Play it, meatbag.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First off, worry not, reader. I will not spoil you, you may proceed without fear through these lines. Now, for the review itself : Star Wars KoTOR, the game everyone puts at the very top of their list when it comes to good star wars games, so one could not expect anything less than perfection.And boy, it delivers.A dense and elaborated plot, tons and tons of lore to read and experience and even an Ace Attorney like section! (lol ok I'm just messing around when it comes to that one, but still.) Of course many will complain about the combat, but what is that if compared to the experience this game will give you?So, buckle up and prepare to travel deep into some of the coolest star wars stories ever!

												This game was awesome back in the day.  I bought it on Steam as part of a Star Wars collection.  It was one of my favorites about 10 years ago!If the game freezes after character creation turn off buffer effects and shadows-credit goes to ""scruffynerfherder1000""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got this game from my grandma for Christmas when it released. I never really had any experience with RPG games and I was really young but I could understand the dialogue well enough to love it. I'm still very young today but back then, the game felt so epic and HUGE! I felt like each planet would take days to finish when in reality it only took a few hours. This was the only game I would ever play, I had to have replayed it over 40+ times and this isn't an exaggeration! Once KOTOR 2 came out I just had to get it, the game was fun but not as memorable as KOTOR 1. I remember being actually scared at points in this game. When I arrived to Malachor V, I literally was frightened to play it. The atmosphere and music was so grim and well done! Yesterday, I found my original XBOX along with both games, I checked my save files and WOW, did I play a lot of this game. The music is so nostalgic and a masterpiece! I decided to replay both games and it still holds up today as my favorite game of all time! KOTOR will forever be in my heart.﻿ I could write an entire 5 page essay on the game because of so much more I have to say about it. But I'll leave it at this, and I highly highly encourage you to try out this game. It may seem kind of stale to todays standards, but back then, it was next-gen. This was the only game that I played in my childhood, and I probably played it for 4 years straight without ever getting bored of it. Please give this game a chance and even the sequel the same. One other thing I would like to mention is how emotionally invested in the characters you can get into this game. I was attatched to multiple characters and they felt like they were my friends in real life. I haven't ever had this feeling until recently, with the masterpiece ""The Witcher 3"", and honestly, it's amazing.			",47,1,0,4,1,0,1

Even for an old game the graphics are really good and I was stunned by the action scene/fighting of the game they are really well made. The Dialogues are very complete and in a lot of ways you can change the course of action ( force persuade is a must its so fun ). But the best of this game is that you do feel like a Jedi while playing and you can play a Sith if you want, choices does a difference aswell.			",124,8,0,12,16,2,6

												I am a fan of Star Wars and remember playing KoTOR when it first came out thanks to my father's love for the series as well. So, when I got a Steam account and saw this title on sale, I jumped on the opportunity to play this game again...hoping that, maybe, there was an improvement from before; maybe the bugs had been fixed.Unfortunately, the bugs are still there.I can live with old-school, ""bad-looking"" graphics, but I cannot fathom why, ages after this has been released and after being put up on Steam, that the bugs are still there. There isn't even a controller support for the game.Story-wise, this game is one of the best, which is why I would recommend it.			",6,5,0,5,1,0,0

												Despite being over a decade old, the game still maintains a modern feel. I have been getting some issues with character getting stuck on the spot and not moving unless you can investigate a nearby item or switch character.The story is consistent and there is a huge level of dialogue available, each character has their own story, but also depending on who is in the party will talk to each other about different subjects. This can be a little random on occasion to be walking in a sewers killing Rakghouls to then have the game paused because Misson looks 'distant'.Still love this game, still poses some challenges in early game play and offers a solid RPG experience.

												I tend not to play RPGs or at least keep a distance or ignore them in any way possible. They are out of my comfort zone and I can do nothing about it,  I'm too scared, too frightened to fire it up and it is especially hard for me to start such a long journey and commit myself to +40h of story. But at the same time I adore RPGs, I love them with all my heart and I love that they make me feel the way they do.I was thinking about playing KOTOR but I never had a chance to. I heard a lot of positive responses over the years of its existence so I got it on Steam Sale. This is one of the most prominent representatives of RPG genre with great story telling, one of the most unexpected plot twists I've ever seen implemented in a video game, 6 different planets for you to explore filled with side quests, loot, lightsabers and other shenanigans for you to find. It features excellent character skill tree and ""d20 roll"" system (named after the iconic 20-sided dice) which seems the most honest one.  ",216,51,6,18,16,5,22

												Its an old game that requires alot of work to get running these days, many people who review this game negatively for technical problems have not bothered to attempt to fix any issues they encounter. With that in mind here is an honest run down of some things in it.Every character is exposition dump. Every character is a cliche. Every character keeps me smiling.  Its a bioware rpg so i guess ye. Combat system is old dnd ish. Turn based realtime combat. Can be satisfying with the thud of three lasers hitting a single target all at once dropping it instantly. Generally the combat sounds and looks good for its age, cwl dueling animations.In terms of gameplay its very easy to manage and is only a problem on sand♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥planet (sry for edge cant spell it) due to level scaling enemies meaning you are swarmed by large numbers of tough asf sandpeople. (do it first)Force powers are cool to use but are comparable to spells u might see in a standard rpg really- Not that they dont appear fitting of star wars- just that the system is the exact same. Nice plot and companions, as well as the Darth Revan ofc being one of the most loved EU characters .  The second game gives us far more ♥♥♥♥♥♥y exposition regarding him that to me is cwl asf. (Is a Starwars Alexander the Great or maybe a starwars Rand al'thor/Matt?). Companions give you that good old exposition dump. However there is plenty of snappy dialogue and plot lines to chase with them. Canderous has some passionate stories for you. Mandalorians have some cool♥♥♥♥♥ships.If you have played the original dragon age- then expect a similar formula for how the game rolls.Finally- the music in this game is top tier... The opening theme for the game Endar Spire is amazing and the level is maintained from this game to the next. This ties in with the overall star wars atmosphere and universe building. Lots of details are filled by the heavy winded exposition. At the same time the atmosphere/music creates powerful dialogue and moments sometimes.  POTENTIAL SPOILERS ""They say the Force can do terrible things to a mind.  It can wipe away your memories and destroy your very identity. ""shiiitttttOverall if you are willing to troubleshoot the game or perhaps buy it from GoG, deal with biowarerpgitus, aged graphics and aged battle mechanics you will find an atmosphere that breathes awesome and characters that go down in star wars history as the best!If u want an idea of the emotional music or kick♥♥♥♥♥music see belowEmotional:

												Over 10 years later and this game is still well worth the money. The combat is a little dated and might take some getting used to but the story, companion characterization and voice acting are top notch. Each area feels new and unique and you can feel the progression of your character as you move through the story.If you  have managed to avoid major plot points thus far I strongly recommend not reading anything else about the game. You're in for a fun ride.I had a couple of minor technical issues running this on Windows 10 but if you don't mind doing a couple quick google searches for problems you encounter (controlled character getting stuck after combat, ect.) you should have a relatively easy time.If you are someone who gets hung up on aesthetics (the game came out in 2003, cut it some slack) or are unwilling to do basic type and click research this may not be the game for you as you most likely will have to fiddle with some of the graphic settings to get things running smoothly.

												Don't be fooled by my Steam playtime. This was the RPG that got me into RPGs (narrowly beating out Morrowind) and when I was young I played through the game in every single way possible on my Xbox. Best birthday gift my grandmother ever gave me.If you enjoy any RPG or story rich games, this is an old gem from the 6th generation that is worth revisiting, even if the graphics don't hold up anymore. The story is amazing, to say the least, and shot Bioware to fame; without KOTOR who knows if they would have made Dragon Age or Mass Effect? If you like those two latter titles, KOTOR is clearly the blueprint of success that Bioware has been building upon in all of their other titles.It is sad that KOTOR II was sent off to Obsidian and that the MMORPG they made have failed to reach the original game's stature, but it is a very large shadow to fill.Bastila and Carth, Malak and Revan -- the characters are very well developed and the voiceacting is still great (and especially for the time period the game is from).The game is so good I bought it on Steam just so I could review it. Give it a shot and you won't regret it.			",50,4,1,12,2,1,1

												There aren't so many games which can make me addicted to these days, but KOTOR is just one of them. I can play it for a whole day without feeling bored. It's one of the greatest star wars games and RPGs ever, which inspired the Mass Effect series. The storyline and teammates are terrific and the process of building your character is satisfying. Besides, it's really cool to play as a Jedi with a lightsaber, fighting with the Sith lord. Although the graphic seems to be out-dated today, it won't take long to get used to that and be caught by the attractive Star Wars universe. Love it so much. 10/10			",50,7,1,10,3,0,4

												Can't play on PC. The game glitches like crazy. Had it on original XBOX and it was fun but now those will only be distant memories. Unless you can deal with or solve the glitches, this game is going to be more hassle than it is worth. Just to reiterate: The game is good, but through the PC it is not worth it.			",51,3,0,3,4,0,2

												A great chapter behind the scenes in the starwars universe. The combat is enjoyable as you travel around the galaxy with your companions, which is another great aspect of the game. This is probably one of the greatest games I have ever played by singleplayer and I enjoyed every part of it, and especially if you are a starwars fan I highly reccommend this game. The storyline is great, as well as everything else except if you are used to great graphics, the graphics are not amazing however this is a relatively old game. What makes it even more enjoyable is the dark side/light side choices; there are choices you make what can decide the rest of the storyline and as a little spoiler you even have your own killer droid eventually! The game is great and reflects the starwars universe superbly.			",135,23,5,19,20,5,36

												Bioware RPG's always have a special feel, and they are great to play.I finished this game a second time now, the first time I played it was as it was fresh and mint out of developement. Now, so many years later it hasn't lost it's apeal. The story and it's developement, the many hints that can give you the creeps - and still keep you guessing. Once again a good roleplaying game under the licence of Lucas Arts: Star Wars Trademark. Graphically dated, but yes there is an upgrade downloadable, there are also some unofficial mods to this game. The game itself is sealed in its story, there is no need to bugger around a lot - because the riddles and minigames are selfexplanatory. Being a Jedi can be quite a hard job at times... Decissions, decissions, decissions... and though some decissions can be quite deadly, others are more aimed at your preference about light and darkness. This time I decided to become a paragorn of the Light side... and, well, let's just say ""Revan"" died this time once and for all.Being a Jedi doesn't mean that you can't use subterfuge or clandestine ops - but you have to make sure that you help others with it, helping out a young couple just to press their families and them out off their money, isn't a good way to start.Off course, the game plays in a time far beyond the main story of the original films of the second and ""first"" triologies - but, it's still Star Wars and it does play a lot like a Star Wars game - running through the windblown and forlorn dunes of Tatooine, you could quite well feel the ""vibes"" of things to come in the future.I can recomend this game on several reasons: It's a Star Wars game. It's a Bioware RPG. It has a lot of depth and is an immersive experience. And Lastly it's Star Wars...Have I forgotten something? Probably, but for this it's just no rocket science.

Knight of the old Republic won game of the year 2003 and is the hight of video game story lines. KOTOR is a really addictive game and one of the best games i have ever played.

												The greatest Star Wars video game ever made.  The gameplay is fantastic and the story is an epic matched only by the original trilogy.  4,000 years before the movies you find your self in the middle of a galactic war between the Sith Empire and the Republic.  It falls to you and your rag tag band of scoundrels to find out how Darth Revan and Malak, heroes of the Mandalorian War and saviors of the Republic, fell to the dark side and raised a fleet large enough to invade the galaxy they just saved.  Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic will remind you why you fell in love with Star Wars.  Prepare yourself for drama, action, betrayal, love, and the Force as you move to decide the fate of the galaxy for the Light or the Dark.			",7,2,0,2,0,0,0

												""Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic"" is possibly the most immersive RPG of all time, in my opinion. The story is fantastic, bringing new, memorable characters into the Star Wars expanded universe. (Not to mention an unexpected plot twist) The gameplay is top notch, my only issue being how your character(s) maneuver(s), but you can easily get used to that small problem.  The worlds are rich and detailed, and there are many, many sidequests for very real-feeling characters. Lovers of Star Wars will love this game. RPG lovers will love this game. Lovers of great games will love this game. Words cannot describe how much I love this this game. One of my favorite gaming experiences of all time. -Sgt. Shy GuyOh, and developers ...

												My absolute favorite Story in the Star Wars Expanded Universe (and I've read a lot of books and played a lot of Star Wars Games).  Fantastic Story with great characters! 6 Classes (3 nonjedi/3 jedi) and light side/dark side choices altering the story give a lot of interesting replayoptions. A great deal of side quests with a great portion of humor (what's in that darn box? :-)) complete this masterpiece. Even for no Star Wars fans a great game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is very good, considering that it was made a long time ago, (see what I did there?) The game has a very interesting story line, and has a good/bad side that you can be. The gameplay is a mix of real time strategy, and a hack and slash based style. I reccomend this game, and give it a 9.5 on my score list. ",93,9,2,23,9,2,2

												(I may only have 5 or so hours on this but I have the game on disc copy and burned out my first set of discs so I've played a ton)This is in my opinion one of the greatest games ever made, definatlly one of the best RPG's everIt is a game that fits amazing character interaction and plot development, into a world where you can more or less explore as you wish. You are not tied to your main character, if you want you could use one of the party memebers you meet as the character you control even.Combat is unuiqe, a mix bettween RTS and Turn Based at the same time, allowing for fast paced action or slow methodical planning, which ever you prefer.One of the things I liked is that there is a stat measure of your light or darkness, and your choices determine where that falls. If it's too light certian options are closed to you, or vice versa.My only complaint with this game is that it's old, so the graphics aren't the best, and it doesn't support modern resolutions; a fairly small complaint for a game.Overall I'd say KOTOR is worth the $10, probobly even worth twice that.Now what're ya waitin for, go get it, and don't forget to load up your atro droid with flamethrowers and take control of 'im XD			",82,6,0,11,14,1,17

												Due to character limits, I was unable to post my full review here. That's why I'll be linking my YouTube review as well as the full written one (if that's allowed) to this post. If I'm not, I suppose the link will be removed and I'll remember that in the future, but the written review it linked in the description on YouTube anyway. So please check those out as I don't want to water it down for you and lose important points in the process. I'm very sorry for this inconvenience but unless the character limit is raised the review just won't all fit here.https://hubworldhq.com/2017/03/25/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic/

												Bioware RPG's always have a special feel, and they are great to play.I finished this game a second time now, the first time I played it was as it was fresh and mint out of developement. Now, so many years later it hasn't lost it's apeal. The story and it's developement, the many hints that can give you the creeps - and still keep you guessing. Once again a good roleplaying game under the licence of Lucas Arts: Star Wars Trademark. Graphically dated, but yes there is an upgrade downloadable, there are also some unofficial mods to this game. The game itself is sealed in its story, there is no need to bugger around a lot - because the riddles and minigames are selfexplanatory. Being a Jedi can be quite a hard job at times... Decissions, decissions, decissions... and though some decissions can be quite deadly, others are more aimed at your preference about light and darkness. This time I decided to become a paragorn of the Light side... and, well, let's just say ""Revan"" died this time once and for all.Being a Jedi doesn't mean that you can't use subterfuge or clandestine ops - but you have to make sure that you help others with it, helping out a young couple just to press their families and them out off their money, isn't a good way to start.Off course, the game plays in a time far beyond the main story of the original films of the second and ""first"" triologies - but, it's still Star Wars and it does play a lot like a Star Wars game - running through the windblown and forlorn dunes of Tatooine, you could quite well feel the ""vibes"" of things to come in the future.I can recomend this game on several reasons: It's a Star Wars game. It's a Bioware RPG. It has a lot of depth and is an immersive experience. And Lastly it's Star Wars...Have I forgotten something? Probably, but for this it's just no rocket science.

												I was a bit weary at first because it just looked old, and usually old games (for me) aren't very fun. But this was amazing. This had good voice acting, a solid plot, with an unexpected twist allowing the player to choose their own path to the Dark side or to become a Jedi. This told the story of the Star Wars history better than any movie could. (Completed in 21 hours. It's a long game.)			",73,29,1,7,6,0,7

It seems to me that Steam is doing its customers a disservice by not putting a disclamer in the description of this or any game that has the same limitations.

												Statement: The RPG that made Bioware famous to non-PC gamers may have one of the most spoiled game stories ever. Spoilers are why I didn't finish for 9 years, and much like ESB, the impact is less if you know ahead of time. But KOTOR isn't just one of the first great Western console RPGs.Explanation: In 2003, two Star Wars prequels & The Matrix Reloaded left many dejected. This was the blockbuster people WANTED. There had been Star Wars games before, but here was a setting wholly untouched by George Lucas. Though much is evocative of the original films, many of the NPCs are rough drafts for Mass Effect's.Observation: The setting hides many of Bioware's now-maligned shortcomings; here the binary morality makes sense. The ""Bioware romance"" can't really come into full effect either. But sci-fi trappings aside it's literally D&D for all the clunkiness that entails. I grew up on Baldur's Gate, so I can deal.Conclusion: The assassin droid HK-47 is the greatest. Play for him, meatbags!			",505,108,4,62,32,2,72

I'm only 14 hours in and expecting this to trump Mass Effect and some other favorites when I'm done...actually, in many ways it already has.

												Love the game. Loved it when it came out, loved it re playing it recently. But I have to give it a negative review. I have played through over 20 hours and have encountered a bug that's broken my game completely. I can't leave Kashyyyk. I've done everything on the planet, and when I try to go back to the Czerka dock I'm met with a black screen in which I can't do anything important. I can't access the menu at all, but I can switch between characters, I've managed to set a mine and use stims judging from the sounds, I think I can move around but can't tell. Managed to somehow miraculously access the menu once after mashing the keyboard constantly for a few minutes, but I couldn't port back to the ship and it went back to blackness afterwards. I haven't been able to find a fix for it either.			",101,31,3,23,17,1,17

												An excellent game for its time, but hasn't aged well. Among other things:- Morality system is black/white to the point of absurdity- Combat is kind of mediocre (Confucius say: he with grenades, wins) - Bioware's trademark creepy romance subplots are at their strongest hereStill, it's what put Bioware on the map and let them go on to make Mass Effect. A decent enough RPG nowadays, and fun for any Star Wars buff or WRPG fan.			",82,19,0,17,16,0,29

												A fantastic Star Wars game destroyed by a disgusting Steam port.It crashes at the Main menu, crashes during loadings and crashes during the cut scenes. Sometimes the game freezes and crashes my computer, corrupting plenty of the game files. It's nearly unplayable and if I hadn't spent 2 out of 4 and a half hours trying to fix it, I would have refunded it. But, if you can find a way to fix the crashes or get past it, Kotor truly is a great game with a fantasic storyline and great gameplay. But with a heavy heart, I can't recommend this Steam Port.

												*Fair warning to everyone buying this.* It seems this game has some horrendous issues running on newer systems, especially multi-core (which most are now). If you want to ever play this game on a PC newer than 2004, you have to have technical skills and some relative knowledge of Windows and its command workarounds for older games.If you don't have experience on things like that, do NOT purchase this game. Even with workarounds it it still buggy and prone to crashes. Unfortunately Steam doesn't supply a working product here for most consumers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great RPG that is fun from the start til the end. The game has a lot of conversations in it that you control what your person says, which takes a lot of time. If you don't liek listening to the lore and such of the game thorugh these conversations, then this probably ins't the game for you. The gameplay is fun and the decision amking allows you to be the ultimate Jedi or Sith, or a combination of the two. The storyline also is fantastic and who don;t really know what is going on until the game wants you to know.			",135,15,2,16,8,1,41

												I've attempted to play this game 4 times. Every time I hated it, but now I love it.When I first played this game I liked Star Wars, I was interested in it alot. I wasn't very patient and I really never gave it a chance. Now I love Star Wars, and I gave it a chance and it was amazing, by far one of the best Star Wars games I've ever played. It takes a while to get past the boring start, but once you really get into the campaign the story is so gripping and exciting.This game is years old, but has aged well along with Battlefront 2. May the Fourth be with you sale is active right now, so you can get this game pretty cheap, along with any other Star Wars game on Steam.I've had the entire collection for a while now, but I would recommend this game to any Star Wars fan.

												An amazing game from back in the early days of Bioware. The twist right near the end I never saw coming in that way Bioware have always been in great story telling. Apart from when they seemed to have become one with EA and messed things up, but I digress.Game starts where the republic ship you are on is under attack from Sith fighters and you have to make your way off the ship, battling your way through sith soldiers and getting to an escape pod where the real meat of the game begins on the planet of Taris.The game is based on the 3rd edition roleplaying game so if you have any experience with D&D you'll have no trouble getting into this game. As i said before, it's classic Bioware with the great storytelling and characters that are so realistic and you end up caring about. You get the chance to become either a Jedi or Sith. Both sides have different types of powers that can be used in many different ways. This is a game I highly recommend for it's story-line and replayability.			",799,421,8,178,93,6,144

												I loved this game as a kid and now, and played through it several times.I understand why people are leaving it tons of positives. The problem is: they're ripping you off with outdated software that has a TON, and I mean A TON of glitches, specially regarding widescreen: sometimes you get it right after hours of tweaking, or you don't.Moreover, it's problematic that many people have served this purpose by recommending this game's steam version (completely not worth the cost) out of pure nostalgia and emotions. If you're thinking about buying this game, I certainly wouldn't recommend you getting this at least here unless you'd love to have it on your library or something. I think it's encouraging companies to be lazy and rip you off with overpriced, non-physical and problematic game engines.Of course, the game itself is amazing and one of the best Star Wars and Bioware games ever, but you're gonna find it hard to adapt this to your specifications.

												Knights Of The Old Republic is possibly the best StarWars game ever made and one of the best games for simulating being Jedi.It's one of the best RPGs BioWare has ever made. That's saying a lot because BioWare also made Baldur's Gate and the Mass Effect trilogy.You get to decide whether to side with the ""Light Side"" and be a Jedi or the ""Dark Side"" and be a Sith.

												Quite possibly the best Star Wars game of all time, Knights of the Old Republic (along with the Tales of the Jedi comics) opened a new era of adventure, tragedy, and drama that I might even like more than the movie era. Fantastic game, with great characters, wonderful voice acting and music, and the general awesomeness that comes from getting to choose your path: towards the salvation of the galaxy, or its destruction....In short, worth your ten bucks!

												I've attempted to play this game 4 times. Every time I hated it, but now I love it.When I first played this game I liked Star Wars, I was interested in it alot. I wasn't very patient and I really never gave it a chance. Now I love Star Wars, and I gave it a chance and it was amazing, by far one of the best Star Wars games I've ever played. It takes a while to get past the boring start, but once you really get into the campaign the story is so gripping and exciting.This game is years old, but has aged well along with Battlefront 2. May the Fourth be with you sale is active right now, so you can get this game pretty cheap, along with any other Star Wars game on Steam.I've had the entire collection for a while now, but I would recommend this game to any Star Wars fan.

												Cons:- Bugs, mainly movement ones, are dime a dozen. You WILL die more than once because your char pathfinding suddenly decided to go on holidays, or he decided that actually casting the Force powers you told him to wasn't all that important, or will be bodyblocked into a corner by your own team mates, or conversely they will somehow get stuck hundreds of meters away.- The light vs dark struggle is about as angsty and childish as you remembered it. ""Omgerd, the jedi council is manipulating you"", ""The dark side is stronger"" *proceeds to get his♥♥♥♥♥kicked* and other moustache-twirling bigotry abounds. In several instances, you get card-carrying villains right away. The sith doesn't even seem consistent about if they want to be openly evil, or just emo.- Clunky combat system interface. It could have done with 16 shortcuts assigned to keys. Instead you have 5 or 7 that you have to click manually to use or cycle.- Much running from one place to another without possibility to fast travel most of the time.- The special effects, combat movements and other graphical fireworks aren't anything to write home about... Obviously you have to take into acount that this game wasn't made exactly yesterday.- The aliens talk gets quite annoying after a while, specially when you realize that the alien has spoken the same phrase 3 times to  say completely unrelated things. Surprisingly, some important dialogues are handcrafted even if they are spoken in alien language.- The inventory UI in general suffers from both overcrowding and lack of information. My guess is that this is due to the game being developed in a time when lower resolutions were the norm. Today, most screen space goes painfully unused.Pros:- The feats, powers and other char-building attributes system is both engaging and understandable, it being pretty much a D&D 3.5 clone.-The game is about 40 hours long, which is quite good in my book. It has lots of sidequests, some of them rather irrelevant, some others can take you half an hour.- Most party-member characters are interesting and I pitied not being able to take all of them and see their dialogues.- You can visit the planets in any order you want, and many characters will have extra dialogues depending on which you have and which you haven't visited yet.- The plot itself is somewhat interesting. Not spectacular, but interesting, as far as the Star Wars franchise goes.Overall: I would give it a 8 out of 10, even compared to today's games. Despite the obvious flaws that more recent games have learned about and corrected before they hit the market, this game is still quite enjoyable and worth finishing. Maybe even replay it in the future.Addendum:Honestly, this whole sith thing makes no sense. I know it's just a fantasy world, but it's really stretching my suspension of disbelief when the world basically runs on:1. The siths being viable only because the evil guys comply with their principles. Literally. There's no reason why there couldn't be 2 siths fighting against eachother, but every single character in the universe seems to have come to accept that if there's a sith lord, then every other sith is at his command. Period.2. Which creates rather dumb situations. I'm growing tired of this whole ""I tortured you, so you now have to serve me"" ""Why?"" ""He... uh... because... dark side, you know"". Why the hell would any apprentice, let's say Bastila in this case, become the bad guy's wilfull servant, instead of stabbing him on the back 5 minutes later out of revenge?3. Unless of course, you argue that they've been brainwashed. Which makes it it's own kind of fun, considering that every fallen jedi ever loves to whine about how the jedi council has brainwashed you and how they seen the light (or the dark) of how much more strong the dark side is.4. Right after which you proceed to kick their collective asses repeatedly. All while they keep claiming that they are stronger. Nevermind that the only way they have grown strong is *because* people is buying into the collective lie. If people didn't *think* the siths are stronger, they wouldn't enlist, and the siths wouldn't be strong. This is basic sociology.5. Instead, in this universe whole armadas seem to turn to the dark side for no specific reason other than ""today I woke up and I was evil"". Because, much like the existence of the sith, apparently the existence of the dark side depends on people despairing over their own perceived fall to the dark side. I blame the Jedi masters for their never ending crap about how you will fall to the dark side if you do this or that. Obviously they make people fear their own feelings and think they've crossed a point of no return as soon as they have a spark of feelings.			",302,74,4,69,35,2,79

												IMPORTANT NOTES:Most negative reviews are about this Steam version, Windows 10 and other tech issues. I can't speak for all, but here's a few things I found, and what worked for me:1. WIn 10 works fine for me with it - I just made sure the .exe runs as an admin and in XP SP2 mode.2. The lack of widescreen is frustrating, but there are a number of fixes that work. And I found one that was even simple to use. Getting widescreen definitely made it much more enjoyable.I just cannot give it a thumbs down for these things. Yes, it'd be nice to have them fixed, but I've seen worse hacks on Steam, and this still rates as EASILY one of the more enjoyable RPGs I've ever played. So 15 mins surfing and 20 or so minutes of farting around were definitely worth it. Still two thumbs up.An the best bit? Reuniting me with one of my earlier NPC crushes... when I was younger MAN how I wanted to use my special light sabre on Bastilla - I swear the things I was thinking were definitely from the dark side...

												This is my number one game of all time, and I definitely don't say that lightly. I may not have a huge amount of hours on this, but that's only because I played this so much before it was on Steam. It's not perfect, but then no game is without faults. I love everything about the Star Wars expanded universe and this is the pinnacle of it, it rises high above the waste and filth that are 90% of Star Wars video games and stands proudly as an amazing story drive experience. Light Side or Dark side, you choose, it's all up to you and it will affect you're ending and which of your party members decide to stand with you.I'm not normally a fan of turn based combat, but they nailed it right here, the animations, the visuals and the effectsdo look quite dated now but believe me, at the time it was a sight to behold.It's hard to give this a neutral critical review because it would be like insulting my child if I were to say too many negative things against it. I cannot recommend this game enough. BUY IT WHATEVER THE PRICEPlus it has one of my favourite WTF moments in gaming.			",132,18,0,15,8,0,20

The Game I Spent Hours Exploring In My Younger DaysWow. When I was younger I was given this game. New to the RPG genre at the time, I played about 5 minutes and basically hated it. About a month later I decided to pick it back up. BEST DESCISION EVER. This game shaped what modern RPGs are. This game looked beautiful when it was new, and I had never seen anything like the massive amount of content inside it before. It was exactly as I remembered, and when I get some time, I'll sit down and play through a couple times. Of course I'll have to check absolutely every container and do every quest, but that's the great part.Good for nostalgia, or if you are craving a new adventure, you won't be dissapointed. 17/5 ",55,7,0,14,9,0,5

												Forget George Lucas's prequel trilogy, the best Star Wars story to take place before the events of A New Hope is Knights of the Old Republic. Of all the Star Wars games I have played over the years this is still head and shoulders above the rest, both in terms of gameplay and narrative.Prepare to spend the next 40 hours exploring the galaxy with Carth, Bastila, and the wonderfully sadistic, HK-47. Even for an RPG this old there is so much scope within the game. Before becoming a Jedi you can opt to be a solider, a scout, or a scoundrel like Han Solo. Each has its benefits and its pitfalls but the real fun is trying a new one every time and seeing which one best suits you.So as HK-47 would probably say, ""statment: do yourselves a favour, meatbags, and buy this game"". Although KOTOR II was a solid sequel, Knights of the Old Republic is still, not just the best entry in the series but, the best Star Wars game out there.			",27,5,0,9,5,0,8

												I highly recommend this game for any Star Wars fan. Its a fun twist of visual novel and rpg elements. After picking it up I found myself emmersed in the story and the characters. Every party member is unique and their progression is based on how you decide to treat them. This is definitely worth a try since it is relatively cheap. Warning: There are bugs in the game and you may find yourself constantly quick saving and loading to regain control over your character. Also, the opening movie crashes the game, but there are guides online to solve this problem quickly.			",66,6,0,24,0,0,4

												This is my first time writing a review ever. I will first start out with how this is one of my favorite game titles from the sixth generation of console's. I was never a true Star Wars game or movie fan, sure I played some games like; star Wars BF 1&2, Star Wars Republic Commando which I would also recommend to any Star Wars fan. Now the KotoR series shows a deep connection not to the history made by George Lucas(not to discredid the man since I do not know how much he has contributed to the historical lore of his series) which the fanbase has mostly made for the accounting matters of most stories before and after the Star Wars Saga(all 6 movies). This Game was the second Star wars game I fell in love with after the first few hours of playing on the original Xbox. The mechanics were something I never really liked in most games and I admit I shrugged it off in terms of not wanting to play it since it went far off what I was used to for gameplay. The story, the Characters, the complete immersion of the destinies of people you interact with that could alter the fate of an entire planet quicker than you would have known of in a game like this. In short I really love this and KotoR II. Because of this game in particular, I have started down the evil path in all decision based games with a morality center like Jade Empire. then I just do everything different on the next playthrough. A lot of the game is laughable in today's sense of ""Modern Gaming"" or in the everything about the game's graphical engine and motor physics of the semi-turn-based combat which was as close to a then modern miracle/innovative as it could be at the time in ""my"" opinion. So yea, I will love and keep supporting games like these and if someone knows of more games like this just leave a msg at the end of the comment or msg my profile. 100/100 Don't mind the almost no play time on the thing, I have logged more than 80 on console			",181,28,4,37,31,0,8

												If you're a Star Wars fan or someone who has some interest getting into the series then this is the game for you. Whether you're a peaceful and honorable jedi or a power-hungry sith I gurantee you'll have a great time. Also, HK-47 is the best.			",47,2,0,6,0,0,3

												IMPORTANT NOTES:Most negative reviews are about this Steam version, Windows 10 and other tech issues. I can't speak for all, but here's a few things I found, and what worked for me:1. WIn 10 works fine for me with it - I just made sure the .exe runs as an admin and in XP SP2 mode.2. The lack of widescreen is frustrating, but there are a number of fixes that work. And I found one that was even simple to use. Getting widescreen definitely made it much more enjoyable.I just cannot give it a thumbs down for these things. Yes, it'd be nice to have them fixed, but I've seen worse hacks on Steam, and this still rates as EASILY one of the more enjoyable RPGs I've ever played. So 15 mins surfing and 20 or so minutes of farting around were definitely worth it. Still two thumbs up.An the best bit? Reuniting me with one of my earlier NPC crushes... when I was younger MAN how I wanted to use my special light sabre on Bastilla - I swear the things I was thinking were definitely from the dark side...

												I can honestly say this is a great game. Played it on the original xbox and just bought it last month or so for Steam. Even as old as it is this game is excellent. the only issue I had was the grass texture whacked out at random, causing a visual mess. But that can be fixed by going to options while at main screen, selecting textures or display (can't remember which) and turning the grass option off. The ground will still be visible but it won't cause any problems.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best Star Wars games this has a fair amount or replayability. Ignore the hours played because I had this game before steam and have finished it multiple times.

												This game got me into RPG's. The greatest game ever, in my opinion. A rich storyline, amazing characters, great voice acting and fun combat. The game world has a lot of interesting things to do, such as side quests, campanion quests, Pazaak (a card game), swoop racing and more. The game is developed by the kings of story, BioWare, so obviosly you can expect a stellar narrative. But it also has something else. One of the greatest plot twists in a game ever in my opinion. People who have finished the game know what I'm talking about ;) You can also go down two paths, light or dark, with you character's appearence reflecting this. At the start you can customize your appearence, but only with pre-set faces. So not like Mass Effect, Skyrim or Dragon Age where you can change everything about your character.Also, it does not support modern resolutions, so it's 800x600 for most. But these are really my only two issues with the game. The rest is the glorious game that I fell in love with when it was released. Seriously, buy this game. You won't regret it.Out of the thousands of games i've played, KOTOR is my all time favourite. That's quite a distinction.			",84,17,0,19,7,0,22

												It's an old game for sure, but it's one of the better SP RPGs out there. It gives you freedom of choice in many circumstances, you can forge or destroy the relationships with your companions...and much more.It is even possible to go full dark side and change the outcome of the game. All in all it's stuff you want from an RPG.Exploration, freedom and a good story with great and annoying characters.However, of course this being a Bioware game, it has numerous bugs, from pathing to movement to quests not being completable, etc. It's what you would expect from this developer, which is pretty sad. And this happens with every Bioware game -.- One would think they would learn.Apart from that, obviously the game is extremely old. While it does even run on a Win 10 machine and looks rather ok, it does not support HD resolutions, the animations are rather clunky (but the combat is great) and the UI is ATROCIOUS. Inventory management is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ If you can bear with all of that you will still find yourself a solid game, even after all this time, but be prepared to make some adjustments...

The Graphics are amazing for it's time and still look alright today. It's got Dialog choices similar to the way Mass Effect works only your main character is not voiced. some of the companions are quite memorable when some arent (Hint: The best character almost shares a name with the AK-47)All and all Great game, for being over 10 years old now			",82,7,0,15,8,0,6

												I remember I tried to play this game a couple of years ago and just could not get into it. Taris felt boring and the combat felt stiff. I then bought this game on Steam and pushed past the Taris section and BOY am I glad I did. This game is simply amazing. Great story, fun progression, great quests and open-endedness of gameplay. Even today this game is very, very good except for some technical issues. Just save often and it won't be a problem at all. For the price, it's a steal. Buy it!			",453,127,4,37,29,6,40

												Overall, I would rate KotOR 8/10 and most definetely one of the greatest RPG titles out there!  Knights of the Old Republic focuses on the span of time after the Mandalorian Wars of the Old Republic, and follows a soldier with little recollection of their past.  The graphics are pretty well done, best enchanced with mods (I have tons of awesome mods on mine that add in content and bring in hd graphics), the gameplay is simple and well executed, and the storyline is a great one to add to your Star Wars repitoee (sp?)  There are some things that sort of get left behind for your character, such as melee weapons and ranged weapons and combative skills that go with them once you become a Jedi (or Sith if that's what you want to role-play) however they still help your companions.  The companion system is great, allowing either 0,1, or 2 companions - be sure to check with all of them for specific content related to your companions!  One game-breaking bug that should be mentioned... try to do Tattoine last if at all possible.  There is a companion mission that leads you to tatooine that gets broken if you have gone to particular places before getting the quest - I could provide more info but that would be a spoiler.  Pick up this great game and have fun!			",135,46,2,23,20,2,24

The twist in the story is the biggest twist in all of gaming, the story kept me so immersed that i couldn't put KOTOR down for more than 10 minutes. Character customization is perfect as you can choose light side or dark side options in dialogue. Dialogue makes this game shine. The first planet on KOTOR is very boring, but after you leave things get really interesting!A must buy for any gamer!!10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Like to mod, there's plenty for this game, including mods that restore content cut from the final release.

												Quite possibly the best Star Wars game of all time, Knights of the Old Republic (along with the Tales of the Jedi comics) opened a new era of adventure, tragedy, and drama that I might even like more than the movie era. Fantastic game, with great characters, wonderful voice acting and music, and the general awesomeness that comes from getting to choose your path: towards the salvation of the galaxy, or its destruction....In short, worth your ten bucks!

												I first played this game when I was ~17 and it was amazing and it still is to this day.  While the graphics are obviously dated it takes nothing away from the masterpiece that this game is.  If you like Star Wars or not if you like RPGs you want to play this game if you haven't.The gameplay is based on d20 role-playing game system.  You can pick your class and your skills.  Force powers are yours to choose.  There are different endings based on your choices as well.  The characters, THE CHARACTERS.  George Lucas wishes this was one of his prequel movies.  The chracters in this game are fantastic.  They don't need to make the story but the fact that they're good makes it an even better overall game.MODS!  There are a lot of mods out there as well.  You can get different lightsabre colors, different clothes for your characters, you can change it up a lot from the original game.Command: Play this game, meatbag. ",135,10,1,21,6,2,11

												This is honestly one of the best RPG's I have ever played. Considering that I played this on the original Xbox when it first came out, then bought it on steam because I truly missed the game. The story is interesting, and not too hard to follow. The gameplay is easy to use, while being accurate and fun. I recommend this game to anybody who wants a good rpg! Just remember that it is an old game, but it might surprise you. 9/10			",19,3,0,1,1,0,0

												This game is totally awesome and I totally recommend it.  I love being evil in this game and using my force power to break people to do my will, and nothing is better than chocking some one nearly to death and then electrocuting them with lightning!

												This is one the greatest games that I have ever played. I originally played KOTOR II on the original Xbox; it was one the best video game experiences I've ever had despite some of the issues with the game. Nearly 9 years later I started using steam and I noticed the KOTOR series on sale. I bought the two games and I must say that was the best decision I've made in a long time. Let me start off with a brief synopsis for those who are unaware of the story of KOTOR I. You essentially play a character with no background. Your first mission is to find a Jedi named Bastilla who was onboard the ship that you were on when it got attacked. Once you rescue her and escape with your new crew, you begin to learn the way of the Jedi on Dantooine. You get to choose the path you want to travel: the light side or the dark side. There is an evil sith lord named Malak who must be stopped, so you can either save the galaxy or become one of the most powerful sith lords. The choice is yours. Along the way you will befriend people and maybe lose them depending on your choices. Now I'm not going to go much more into the story; that is for you to discover dear reader.If you are a Star Wars fan, then get this. You can't call yourself a fan without having played this game. If you love RPGs, then get this game. Some issues are the d20 combat system that might seem unengaging and annoying at times. The story is a bit too black and white, but keep in mind that the Star Wars series in general has held a black and white morality viewpoint. This was just a minor issue for me because I had played KOTOR II before this game and it seemed to do a better job at making the morality of both the Jedi and the Sith greyish. The game might also seem a bit dated now, but trust me it holds up fairly well. The sheer mythology of Star Wars should be enough for you to buy this game. Even if you don't consider yourself a Star Wars fan, you will still enjoy this game. I hope this review answers any questions you had. Now I have a question for you: why are you wasting your time reading this when you should be playing KOTOR?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is both a fantastic RPG and a fantastic Star Wars game. BioWare excellently crafts meaningful outcomes for player decisions. This is mostly acheived through an accessible, yet deceptively deep combat system, beautiful character design and execution, imaginative world-building, and interesting dialogue trees. Role-playing as either a light, gray, or dark jedi delivers unique and fulfilling gameplay that stays true to the greater Star Wars lore. It really is a shame that so much Star Wars media from this time period has been declared non-canon, since SW:KoTOR's themes and stories really do pay respect to and benefit Lucas' original Star Wars. I should this game isn't for everybody. While it does deliver fun RPG gameplay for RPG fans and awesome Star Wars content for Star Wars fans, audiences outside these two sets might find issue with much of the game's offerings. The game is suspect to many of age-old issues with classic RPGs: points of no return, difficulty spikes, and unclear combat specs. Graphically speaking, the game holds up fine, but some animations and textures can be a bit jarring at times. The game's native aspect-ratio was developed with XBOX consoles in mind back in 2003, so displaying current PC monitor resoltions won't scale the game to the whole screen. That said, the game's general art design does make the low-res pill easier to swallow.			",137,31,1,9,14,0,8

												I highly recommend this game for any Star Wars fan. Its a fun twist of visual novel and rpg elements. After picking it up I found myself emmersed in the story and the characters. Every party member is unique and their progression is based on how you decide to treat them. This is definitely worth a try since it is relatively cheap. Warning: There are bugs in the game and you may find yourself constantly quick saving and loading to regain control over your character. Also, the opening movie crashes the game, but there are guides online to solve this problem quickly.			",66,6,0,24,0,0,4

												Forget George Lucas's prequel trilogy, the best Star Wars story to take place before the events of A New Hope is Knights of the Old Republic. Of all the Star Wars games I have played over the years this is still head and shoulders above the rest, both in terms of gameplay and narrative.Prepare to spend the next 40 hours exploring the galaxy with Carth, Bastila, and the wonderfully sadistic, HK-47. Even for an RPG this old there is so much scope within the game. Before becoming a Jedi you can opt to be a solider, a scout, or a scoundrel like Han Solo. Each has its benefits and its pitfalls but the real fun is trying a new one every time and seeing which one best suits you.So as HK-47 would probably say, ""statment: do yourselves a favour, meatbags, and buy this game"". Although KOTOR II was a solid sequel, Knights of the Old Republic is still, not just the best entry in the series but, the best Star Wars game out there.			",27,5,0,9,5,0,8

												This is my first time writing a review ever. I will first start out with how this is one of my favorite game titles from the sixth generation of console's. I was never a true Star Wars game or movie fan, sure I played some games like; star Wars BF 1&2, Star Wars Republic Commando which I would also recommend to any Star Wars fan. Now the KotoR series shows a deep connection not to the history made by George Lucas(not to discredid the man since I do not know how much he has contributed to the historical lore of his series) which the fanbase has mostly made for the accounting matters of most stories before and after the Star Wars Saga(all 6 movies). This Game was the second Star wars game I fell in love with after the first few hours of playing on the original Xbox. The mechanics were something I never really liked in most games and I admit I shrugged it off in terms of not wanting to play it since it went far off what I was used to for gameplay. The story, the Characters, the complete immersion of the destinies of people you interact with that could alter the fate of an entire planet quicker than you would have known of in a game like this. In short I really love this and KotoR II. Because of this game in particular, I have started down the evil path in all decision based games with a morality center like Jade Empire. then I just do everything different on the next playthrough. A lot of the game is laughable in today's sense of ""Modern Gaming"" or in the everything about the game's graphical engine and motor physics of the semi-turn-based combat which was as close to a then modern miracle/innovative as it could be at the time in ""my"" opinion. So yea, I will love and keep supporting games like these and if someone knows of more games like this just leave a msg at the end of the comment or msg my profile. 100/100 Don't mind the almost no play time on the thing, I have logged more than 80 on console			",181,28,4,37,31,0,8

												IMPORTANT NOTES:Most negative reviews are about this Steam version, Windows 10 and other tech issues. I can't speak for all, but here's a few things I found, and what worked for me:1. WIn 10 works fine for me with it - I just made sure the .exe runs as an admin and in XP SP2 mode.2. The lack of widescreen is frustrating, but there are a number of fixes that work. And I found one that was even simple to use. Getting widescreen definitely made it much more enjoyable.I just cannot give it a thumbs down for these things. Yes, it'd be nice to have them fixed, but I've seen worse hacks on Steam, and this still rates as EASILY one of the more enjoyable RPGs I've ever played. So 15 mins surfing and 20 or so minutes of farting around were definitely worth it. Still two thumbs up.An the best bit? Reuniting me with one of my earlier NPC crushes... when I was younger MAN how I wanted to use my special light sabre on Bastilla - I swear the things I was thinking were definitely from the dark side...

The Game I Spent Hours Exploring In My Younger DaysWow. When I was younger I was given this game. New to the RPG genre at the time, I played about 5 minutes and basically hated it. About a month later I decided to pick it back up. BEST DESCISION EVER. This game shaped what modern RPGs are. This game looked beautiful when it was new, and I had never seen anything like the massive amount of content inside it before. It was exactly as I remembered, and when I get some time, I'll sit down and play through a couple times. Of course I'll have to check absolutely every container and do every quest, but that's the great part.Good for nostalgia, or if you are craving a new adventure, you won't be dissapointed. 17/5 ",55,7,0,14,9,0,5
