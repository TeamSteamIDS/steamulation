												Many people buy this game thinking they're buying a System Shock or a Deus Ex. Maybe a Borderlands or a STALKER. This is an incorrect assumption to make. It's true that EYE features many RPG elements. It has dialogue, branching paths, levels, inventory management, stores and side-missions. But this is all plays second fiddle to what EYE is really aiming for. It's not a Deus Ex as much as it is a Serious Sam. It's not a Borderlands as much as it is a Painkiller. I really cannot emphasize this enough, it's my belief that the majority of the complaints directed towards EYE stem from a false presupposition of what this game is trying to be. That is not the players fault though, because EYE doesn't exactly make these things clear.EYE is a mess.Unless you are a Dwarf Fortress player, EYE is likely to be the biggest, messiest game you are ever likely to see. Right off the bat it gives you a character creation screen which makes absolutely no sense to anyone beginning the game without first googling what in the hell you are looking at. The dialogue is either intentionally vague, bizarre and most of the time incomprehensible. You will be thrown into a world which appears to have some sort of lore and backstory but you'll be lucky if you ever understand a tenth of what is going on. When the game presents you with the tutorial level, many aspects of that tutorial will need tutorials themselves, and you will be confronted with a library of tutorial videos on how certain game mechanics work. Your body can be hacked and destroyed by doors and ATMs. Sometimes huge monsters will appear in the level and fire rockets in directions you didn't even know existed and you have to kill it. Sometimes you'll be tasked to kill a high ranking enemy and he will zip about the game shooting and cloaking tanking hits like nothing else. This game is primarily single-player, but you can have 64-player coop. You can buy spells and augmentations and guns and big hammers all with a currency called Brozouf which you seem to endlessly gain in areas where you are doing something for some reason for someone. EYE is a deranged and twisted mess of Syndicate, Neuromancer, Warhammer 40k and the entire personal drug stash of Hunter S. Thompson. And you know what? It's amazing.There is no messing around with regenerating health, cover or killcams. You can go in fast and furious or heavy like robocop. The guns feel like they should. There is real impact when you shoot something. Enemies will go flying across the screen. You can teleport into people and laugh as they explode. You can hit people in the face with giant hammers and watch as they bounce off the walls. You can hack people. You can force push four-armed creatures into radioactive goo. You can block bullets with swords. This game can be anything you want, but above all it is satisfying. If you get this game, it's imperative that you know what you getting into. If you want a cyberpunk dystopia with thought provoking dialogue and choices that mean something, I don't advise you to get this game. If you want a crazy FPS that is a completely unapologetic mess that explains nothing but offers everything then I would strongly recommend this game.			",228,52,2,22,16,1,32

												When my friend gifted me a copy of this game for what was essentially 75 cents, I could have been forgiven for thinking this was some kind of insult to the worth of our friendship; just another bad co-op game to mess around in and laugh at for a few hours.I could NOT have been more wrong.Reviewers keep saying that E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy plays like some horrifying hybrid of Deus Ex, Warhammer 40K, Ghost in the Shell... I could go on. It is a fairly convincing argument, in that I can't say there is any particular gameplay element that hasn't been done in another game, in some cases, better than E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy. But there's something about the way all the numerous elements are put together that turns the game into something inexplicably unique.E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy was supposedly inspired by the creator's own tabletop RPG, and it shows. Leveling attributes, purchasing equipment, diverging quests and storylines, it is all pretty standard, but solid and really well thought out. Guns feel satisfying to use, and don't even get me started about the sword that explodes things. There's this super bizarre art-style as well, and this impenetrably complicated backstory. It plays like a lucid dream, and like a dream, it makes sense while you're in it, but once you wake up you're able once again to reflect on how absurd it was.In fact, this game is so odd, it defies criticism. Every complaint I can render can be immediately turned into a selling point.The confusing state of affairs and alliances in the story that would normally frustrate me is actually perfectly appropriate. It reflects how little you know about this strange place and adds weight to decisions. Frankly, it parallels how little I know about real world history, and that actually seems appropriate.The difficult hacking is incredibly hard to master, but a door can literally hack me back and kick my face in. Spending 10 minutes hacking a gunship to be back-hacked 5 times before finally succeeding and using the gunship to level a platoon of enemies is a great feeling.The bizarre interactions with enemies that can literally cause your character to have a mental breakdown, start hallucinating and uncontrollably shoot all your allies. This is a win-win situation when playing with your buddies. Just trust me, it is.The severe lack of explanation of controls gives this feeling of accomplishment to figuring out how to jump. The broken English adds to the atmosphere, the characters really seem like they're speaking another language, one designed to describe psychokinetic ghost monsters that we have no easy words for in our primitive language. There are however, easily installed mods to help clarify some of the worst gramatical errors.I should add as a last warning that when attempting to get the last ""ending"" of this game, I found that the final level was one of the most tedious areas in the game, filled to the brim with bullet-sponge enemies. However, the other endings were good enough for me to overlook this in the end.When it comes down to it, E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy is a very decent and enjoyable RPG FPS that takes every opportunity to completely screw with your mind. If you are a recovering drug addict and you're feeling withdrawal, this game could substitute for altering your state of mind. And that is why I love it.My legs are OK.			",109,22,1,5,3,4,5

												In a sense, it is silly for me to post a review for this game since this is such a love-it-or-hate-it game that there is no way to tell if you like it except by playing it yourself. (Quite conveniently there is a demo.)I will admit, I was afraid that this game would be next in a streak of bad purchases on my part. E.Y.E quickly showed me that my doubts were unfounded.E.Y.E is a combat focused fps/rpg, and the combat is amazing. In this game, an assault rifle is not a bullet hose; it is a deadly weapon with high recoil and each shot having extreme stopping power. The hunting rifle feels like it could kill a god. The Damocles sword causes explosions on hit and can block bullets.In addition to all that, your play style can be augmented with powers such as the cloak (A la Crysis) or the dermal sheath to enhance your armor. You can obtain spells that can drive a target insane to stir up chaos within a horde or you can implode an enemy and teleport to where it used to be.Most of this is unlocked by spending money (Brouzouf) at the temple HQ. In addition to that, you spend money to purchase cybernetic upgrades anywhere which enhance your powers and statistics. In addition to all that, you can save multiple characters that play wildly differently.Now for the bad stuff. This game is prone to bugs, including an unfortunate bug that causes saving to not work sometimes. That is the number one word of caution I'd issue to potential customers, but if you are willing to put up with it you will be rewarded.As others have said, this game does not explain itself very well. I didn't have too much trouble getting into it, but some will. (I would suggest using auto skill point allocation on your first attempt.) A more diplomatic reviewer would say that there is a strong element of discovery; the fact that this game tells you so little means you can play for months and still find something completely new.And there are bizarre and often unnecessary mechanics such as sanity, which can be nullified by the research system. Dying has potential to leave a permanent statistical penalty, except that it's not really permanent. You can also get rid of that with the research system. (The research system being one of the most bizarre and unintuitive parts of the game.)Having said all of that, I would still strongly recomend this title to anybody that has patience for a game that is a little rough around the edges. Very few games are as rewarding as this, and for $10 it is an excelent value.			",92,3,0,4,2,0,4

												You have to admire a game with ambition. Unfortunately, sometimes, a game shoots for the moon and misses – a game with incredible ambition just may not have the budget or staff to fully realise those ideas, but you have to give credit to a developer for trying something a little different. E.Y.E. Divine Cybermancy does not shoot for the moon. It hammers together a death laser from twigs and spunk and accidently blows up an orphanage. This game was sold to me as “Warhammer 40000 meets Deus Ex”, but really that does not do this game justice. Everything about E.Y.E is completely and irredeemably mad. Things start as they mean to continue. The game immediately asks you to create a character with a baffling recombinant genetic system – various genes are spliced together to form a statistical framework for your character, with absolutely no indication what the various stats might be used for nor how they’re calculated. This quickly becomes a running theme throughout this game, as you’re dumped into the universe with absolutely no clue what is going on - either in the games utterly labyrinthine underlying system, or in the bonkers story that surrounds it. You play a cyber-knight wizard from a monastic order of Space Templars – immediately familiar territory for fans of Games Workshop, though there’s definitely an underlying layer of French surrealism that goes beyond the weirdest nonsense dribbled out of Nottingham. From what I can gather from the largely gibberish story, you are trying to topple a poorly defined federation, as well as dealing with a schism in your order which has lead to cyber wizard  infighting.  You also conveniently have amnesia, or cyberbrain damage, or something, though in a break from tired tradition everyone treats you like a retard whenever you ask any questions you should blatantly already know.  There’s also monsters that come from, or are maybe made out of something called the meta-streumonic force. This force seems to give you psychic powers (because of course it does), but is otherwise unexplained. It mainly serves to add a bit of enemy variety, though considering how annoying these monsters are to fight, you might wish the developers hadn’t bothered. E.Y.E. is an RPG/shooter hybrid, one that takes heavy influence from genre luminaries Deus Ex and System Shock 2. The abilities and equipment available to even a starting character is surprisingly vast. In addition to the expected cybernetic upgrades, there are also psychic powers – you begin the game with the ability to clone yourself three times, which in addition to giving the enemies more targets also have an admirable level of firepower, though they appear to have graduated from stormtrooper marksmanship academy. Most characters will choose to specialise as the higher levels of psychic powers, cybernetic upgrades and weapons are only available to characters with an appropriately high stat. Unusually, every stat is useful, and it is quite possible to make a “jack of all trades” character without gimping yourself. The actual missions are a hectic, sprawling and confused affair. The mission maps are absolutely enormous, and there are multiple ways to complete a mission with various styles that are effective. Combat wise, a character based on hacking and cyberwear might use his cloak to close , drop a drone and hack an enemies brain, whereas a psychic knight might teleport (well, telefrag) about the battlefield cleaving up enemies with the preposterously powerful melee options. Enemies respawn and mill about the place, and unfortunately are ridiculously accurate over long distances – early characters can often find themselves turned into cyber mulch before they even work out where fire is coming from.  This can make a sniper weapon even for close range beatsticks an unfortunate necessity. The ways in which characters can complete objectives are also rather varied – hackers gain a variety of optional shortcuts, and most missions give you two or three ways to deal with a problem, including a diplomatic path. Now would be a suitable time to bring up the game’s dialogue, which is without exception mental. I’m not sure whether it’s a translation issue or the script was just this mad to begin with, but NPCs seem to switch characters multiple times throughout any interaction – a stoic character that starts out your best friend may become incredibly aggressive for no reason, or regress into surfer lingo. That last part is not a joke. In all honesty this just adds to the surreal atmosphere, and whether it was intentional or not it’s certainly entertaining.  What is not entertaining is the way in which this game deals with death. I appreciate that there needs to be a penalty for failure, but this game is needlessly punitive and it very nearly soured me on the whole experience. Every time you die, there’s a chance you will gain a fatal injury – which vary from a minor to an enormous permanent stat decrease. Some of these are the equivalent of losing two or three whole character levels – and considering most people will finish the game at around lv25, this is not a small issue. There is a karma stat that influences the likelihood of these injuries occurring, but I never worked out what influenced it – it seemed to go up and down entirely randomly. A few early mistakes can forever cripple a character, and even with a VERY late game way of removing these injuries it feels like a very poorly thought out mechanic. However, if you can put up with the rough edges, there’s definitely an intriguing game buried in amongst the madness. You might not love E.Y.E, but you will certainly remember it – and that’s more than can be said for some games with a hundred times its budget.			",277,65,3,45,10,1,26

												Enter the most precise instance of a gaming rough diamond. Before you waste away thousands of rifle rounds on hostile targets and feel frustrated with the unstable mechanics, this singular piece shall guide you through its uncanny corridors of ethereal aesthetics and awe-inspiring level design with cryptic conceptual texts and inhuman characters. What you are about to experience if you are ready to hit the “play” option on Steam is unlike any previous gaming session you have had.These French developers allowed no boundaries of sanity to sink into the game’s foundations, and even when facing the predicaments of low-budget production in building a massive world, they resorted to landscapes of colossal, dead skyscrapers or Martian rocks and alien sacred ruins. E.Y.E. is, in most of its characteristics, a unique game, and its architecture and depressing lighting and feeling of constant hostility might scare the newcomer away; if not, then the never-ending enemy hordes with minute aiming are more likely to cause that effect later on. After surfacing from such unyielding challenges, you might still be able to enjoy its wonderful vistas and its almost perfect FPS traits intensely – featuring the most creative and challenging hacking system I have ever tried.The death system is cruel, and unlike anything I have ever seen in RPGs. The infamous fatal wounds will drop your skill values permanently (at least until the BioRegen augmentations are researched), and Karma WILL weigh in against you when the dice of death roll. It is only one of the several nuisances that E.Y.E. will unfold (others include: the unrealistic spawning patterns, the unbalanced and unexplained mechanics, the sometimes unpolished visuals, the inconsistent research requirements, poor proofreading, etc.). But that obstacle is easily outtaken as your motor and psychological responses begin adapting to the game’s chaotic structure rapidly. The player may not feel comfortable with the vertiginous world that E.Y.E. portrays, but they shall respect the sensorial value of its audiovisual execution and the impact of its apparently “nonsensical” mythos about an unimaginably futuristic humanity that has populated several exoplanets and has fused cybernetics with the power of its psyche and dark thaumaturgy. Yes, the premise of the game goes that far.With all of its annoying flaws, this game amazes me every time I start it up. Unsure if it is because of its psychedelic telling of a bleak and metaphysical future or because of its entertaining gameplay, I choose to take on a holistic perspective on it and appreciate its hindrances and virtues, since it allows for that luxury. All that being said, I certainly recommend this Deus Ex/System Shock/DooM/Warhammer 40K - FPS/RPG hybrid for any fan of any such items.			",219,35,14,36,22,1,38

												E.Y.E.: Divine Cybermancy is probably the biggest video game enigma I have ever laid eyes upon, and as such I couldn't exactly give it a ""Proper Review"". All you need to know is that it's not for people who don't like experimenting and fumbling around in the dark trying to figure out what is going on. This game takes a lot of dedication and can be frustrating to those who will not take the time to figure it out.But you'll never play anything like it ever again. Take that for what you will, I'm going to give this game a recommendation on the basis of how unique and out there it is. I couldn't get into it personally since I'm not a very ""Experimenty"" kind of guy, but I could never in good conscience thumb down a game that is this creative. Besides, the general consensus is that you will love this game if you can get into it.			",510,87,9,35,15,4,22

												E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy has been coded by crazy people and is in its own way ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic once you accept that you just are not going to understand what's going on and that you have a katana that blocks bullets somehow and that it's almost as if a really wasted DM made a Shadowrun campaign then someone coded it while taking 15 minute breaks to stretch their legs and bang grams of coke.E.Y.E is a linear RPG with a collection of nice ideas but flawed executions. You can play alone or cooperatively with up to three other friends, taking on quests for the Culter clan. The gameplay is a mix of Deus Ex and Fallout 3, where you can take on some quests in multiple ways - alternate entrances, barging in through the front door, hacking certain access points to finish your objective. It's nice in co-op when one character can focus on building a particular skill (hacking was mine, for example) and another can spend points on other attributes to better round out the team.The biggest problem this game has is its low-budget trappings and short campaign length. While I was surprised how good the gunplay felt, don't expect voice acting, quality translation, a fleshed out story and characters etc. It's a few notches above a bare-bones mod running on Source. E.Y.E is also rather brief, about 10 hours or so with nothing to keep you playing afterward.This game is essentially Deus Ex but ten times f**king weirder and I love it for that, within the first 20 minutes you kill your mentor but you are not his murderer, fight a creature of the Metastreumonic-force, shoot a bandit with a shotgun from a mile away, and talk to people who may or may not even exist.If the story is too confusing for you, I'll provide a rundown: You are part of an organization whose primary goal is to rescue space turtles. You travel the galaxy rescuing space turtles. That is all you need to know.			",1666,682,61,226,179,19,307

												What happens when you take a bunch of french people, give them the source engine and let them run amok with it? The result is EYE: Divine Cybermancy, a game with no limitations or respect for the rules of game design, with over the top action, incredibly in-depth, flexible and at times daunting character progression, abusable physics, insanely powerful weapons and an perplexingly convoluted, mind-numbing narrative coupled with a generous host of bugs, 16+ player coop and generally just absolutely crazy gameplay. EYE is SO crazy that the player character has a sanity meter, and when it dips low, he can suffer vivid halucinations. EYE gives the player numerous options for negotiating its sprawling stages: Where negotiation, hacking and stealth fail, the player can employ a varying array of firearms, melee weapons, cybernetic augments and psychic powers to devastate your numerically superior but sorely outmatched foes. As you progress, even assault VTOLs and twenty-foot tall rocket-spewing psycho-deamons will not give you pause. EYE also lets you adjust not only its difficulty but the respawn rate and AI behaviors of its enemies, giving you fine control over its experience. EYE has a few major issues, most notably its poor English translation, easily (and necessarily, in my opinion) remedied by downloading and applying a fan-made translation patch, available from the steam forum. EYE was released around the same time as Deus Ex: Human Revolution, obviously to capitalize on an upswing in interest in cyberpunk games, but in truth, it is a very different beast. Where Deus Ex rewards the calculating, stealthy player who avoids the game's useless lethal weapons in favor of the almighty tranq rifle, EYE fully allows you to become an unstoppable, heavily armed and armored, posthuman super-warrior, and its setting and asthetic owes a great deal more to Warhammer 40,000 then, say, Neuromancer- amusing considering this game's developer has gone on to work on an actual 40k game, the upcoming FPS Space Hulk: Deathwing. EYE is a strange, awkward game, but well worth the price of admission.			",333,6,5,16,2,1,15

												It's hard to know where to start with a game like Divine Cybermancy, a game with more ideas in the first hour than most franchises.It's a shooter, so conceptually it's pretty simple: you click on things, and those things can generally be trusted to die when you've clicked them enough. But Streum On Studio has so many twists for the tired formula that the end result is barely recognizable, in no particular order: bullet parrying, summoning, real-time hacking, superpowers, non-linear levels, randomized objectives, real-time research, insanity, permanent debuffs, full difficulty control, spellcasting, cyber demons, augmentations, classes, PVP, and of course the old source standby prop killing. I could write a wall of text on any of these, but instead let's take an example. I was going through the campaign co-op with some pals, and at one point we had to seize a Federal scrambler, currently under control of a looter group. Mars was quite the war zone at this point--something we hadn't kit for--so by the time we finally reached the objective we'd lost most of our resurrectors to chopper attacks and were hurting bad. Despite our best efforts, negotiations with the hackers broke down and I had to try to hack it myself, which is fortunate because I'd rolled hacker for this character. It looked like a tough hack, but nothing to worry about. Worst case, the scrambler hacks me and I hack myself free before trying again. It turns out there's worse than being hacked, something I discovered when I failed the attempt and promptly exploded, consuming our last resurrector and putting an end to our comedy of errors. I blamed the party for trying to rush me, but still made a point to invest in my cyber brain more seriously.As you can see, there's a lot going on in the world of cybermancy; this is both the game's greatest strength and weakness. On the one hand, you can kill people with your healing syringe. On the other hand, you have no way to heal until you figure out the research system and actually get one. The price of depth is complexity, and this has to be the most impenetrable shooter I've ever played. Let's try and break it down: at its most basic level you have a very cyberpunk tactical shooter, think SMOD: Tactical meets Human Revolution. Now add Warhammer type melee weapons with ability to block bullets and complementary magic powers to go fast, summon allies, teleport, and whole lot else. There's also the obligatory cybernetic augmentations to wallhack, godmode, cloak, see sound, etc. But unlike those games, there's a comprehensive leveling system, which manifests itself in several ways. But before I explain what it is, I should be very clear on what it's not. It's not WoW/Everquest/Division where the battle is decided from the first moment by who has the bigger numbers. While a higher level confers certain advantages, it's still first and foremost a high-lethality FPS. So what is it? It's three systems working in tandem. First is the generic leveling template: kill and accomplish objectives to get XP to blah blah blah you could finish this in your sleep. Second you have an augment-alike system where you can choose from a selection of cyber limbs to augment for a sum of brouzoufs (currency), improving the related stats along with some more technical benefits. Cyber arms to become stronger, a cyber reflex system to dodge attacks and move/attack faster, a cyber skull to prevent headshots, etc. My personal favorite is cyber legs, which let you go (very) fast and jump higher than most buildings are tall. The third and most interesting system is that of research. Every enemy has a chance of dropping a briefcase, which contains the information for a cryptic research. Research can be started from any time ingame by bringing up the respective menu and paying the brouzouf requirement. The research continues in the background for a set amount of time depending on how many brouzoufs were committed, and when it completes unlocks a thing. The research is system is intentionally quite opaque: researches don't have explanatory names or descriptions and it's impossible to know what benefits they'll confer until after the research completes. Some research also requires other researches finished as a prerequisite, and the best researches have many such prerequisites. It's a great system, one that works exceedingly well to reinforce the game's mystery, something this game has in spades but more on that later.Take all this and drop it in huge, non-linear maps. Each map can be explored in its entirety from the start and enemies' spawn depends on your location. This is great because it adds significantly the dynamism of the levels and with it the replay value, perhaps Cybermancy's single strongest point. Every level can be replayed as a side mission, but instead with randomized objectives so that each play is its own unique experience. Add to this a fairly granular difficulty control and you have the chocolate to the maps' peanut butter. Namely respawn rates, reaction time, sight and sound detection, and accuracy can be configured. It's not great, but it's leagues above most of its competitors, the sad state of affairs that is. The downside is that there aren't that many levels in the game proper, about a dozen or so total. This wouldn't be a problem--the game supports custom levels--but for whatever reason the mapping community hasn't stepped up. So while the replayability is remarkably high, but you can expect to replay the same maps quite a few times. Again not as good as it could be, but better than the overwhelming majority of AAA releases.Now If you've heard just one thing about this game, it's probably that it's bat-ｓｈｉｔ insane. Indeed this is undoubtedly the single strangest game I've seen since LSD Dream Simulator, yet here it adds immeasurably to the charm of the game. You're dropped unceremoniously in the middle of the action, left to pick up the pieces and figure out what's going on. The game seems to delight in your confusion and very pointedly goes out of its way to never really explain what's going on. You'd think that a game being intentionally obtuse would be a major point of criticism, but honestly I quite like it. It lends the whole thing a very alien, almost dreamlike quality that works exceedingly well in context. I'd love to say more, but we're venturing awful close to spoiler territory as is. Suffice to say it's half-past the future and you're fighting the man in a cyberpunk dystopia that spans the stars and if you want anymore than that you'll have to beat it out of me.Like all decent cyberpunk games, Cybermancy makes an attempt at world-building and while I want to say the results are hit-and-miss, that's really not accurate. It's more like hit-and-didn't-shoot-out-of-budget. It's pretty evident Streum On wanted to make a huge living world but they ran out of money long before they could deliver. On the one hand, the maps are all gorgeous and bursting with personality in their architecture and such-like design, but on the other hand they're confusing ghost towns. About the only NPCs that aren't enemies are quest givers/targets, there's almost no obligatory background reading to be found, and numerous maps have strange and strangely empty dead ends that seem to exist as little more than monuments to cut maps. To its credit it's something I never really notice while I'm killing feds, but there is still a very palpable lack.In summary, Divine Cybermancy is one of the strangest games I've ever played. While that alone should be enough to recommend it, the excellent co-op tactical shooter, leveling system, replayability and sheer mind-numbing depth are more than enough to justify its purchase. The insanity is just the cherry on top. The game is far stronger in co-op than single-player, so bring a couple friends along for the ride.And always check your legs before moving out.

												Walked into a cave with three rasta bandits and one of my allies in it.My friend informed me the rastas had a powerful satellite antenna, but they wouldn't let us use it.I asked the rasta leader if we could use the antenna, he said no.I threatened them with violence and he laughed at me.Two seconds later they were all dead.We still didn't know how to use the antenna.I tried to hack it, but it hacked me back.Had to hack myself to get unhacked.Got angry, tried again.Antenna hacked me so hard I died.11/10 Would get hacked to death by a rasta satellite antenna again.

												Well bought this game because it was on offer and didnt really know what to expect.Now i know its had some terrible reviews and to be honest when i first started playing i really didnt know what i was doing and i could'nt really get into it.But then something happened,i found myself getting into the game and i actually started to understand what was going on (still learning now to be honest).The graphics are really not that bad (not up to the standard of some games though) and the music is ok and the voice acting-well dont really know as the voice overs are'nt in English (it gets put up on screen for you to read-and set your resolution high enough or it will just look muddy).In game the missions vary from defending a raider hacking a console whilst keeping creatures (that look like they belong in a RIDDICK movie) at bay to planting explosives to hacking consoles.The main problem is that the game only starts to give away some of its quirkier and more helpfull gear and items the more time you put in (so like me if i had given up after a short play time i would'nt like the game like i do now) and trust me some of this gear is really helpful in later missions (the cloak and vision enhancements are really important and usefull in doing missions and not getting noticed),but all these things cost money.You earn this by downing enemies and doing certain things whilst in level,from assasinations to hacking certain consoles and trust me the more you can earn the better (WELL OF COURSE DUH).You then spend this at the main hub where you receive missions and can do so with the medic (cyber enhancements like cloak and the vision ability that lets you see the enemies through walls),gunseller (new and better weapons,""YEAH NO KIDDING"") or the guy in the library that sells basically cyber enhancements that behave like magic.I have found that some levels are quite a challenge and that early on you will die a fair few times until you get good enough (or have enough enhancements) to best the level,dont worry you do get 9 chances in the forms of the ""RESORECTOR"" which makes you rise where you fell and continue from there.I quite like the story (what i can understand so far anyway) and i especially like the mysterious stranger who seems to know a lot more than he is letting on.I think that like a lot of games if they arent accesible straight away then this puts a lot of people of,not me i have played and finished both DARK SOULS and DEMON SOULS numerous times and find that the less you know in games about whats going on its all the better as there is nothing more inquisitive than the will to explore and not have someone telling me what to do or hold my hand.I do reccomend this game but only if you want to invest some time in it as it doesnt reveal all that it has to show in 1 sitting (unlike some other big shooters) and that the more you play the more you will learn and get to grips with it.

												Across my entire games library, there is no title I am able to call more confusing than E.Y.E. I've long sat on the fence between calling it the most incoherent trainwreck of a game I've ever seen and the one of the absolute best RPG shooters I've ever played. As the thumbs-up on this review suggests, I usually fall off the latter side of the fence.E.Y.E. is many things, but, as stated, it is an RPG at its core and an FPS at heart. These labels, however, hardly do it justice. Between its rich feature list and innumerable player statistics that can all be taken advantage of as one pleases, E.Y.E. is a game that can practically be played any way you want.Want to throw on heavy armor and rampage through levels with a minigun? Go for it. Want to strip down to nothing, grab a power sword, and speed through maps at 400MPH like it was Hotline Miami? Your call. Want to grab a shotgun, leap ten stories into the air onto the head of a cyberdemon, and pump your way through his skull? Entirely possible.Between character builds, weapon loadouts, personal playstyles, and the robust, unique hacking minigame, it would almost be entirely correct to say that there's little you can't do in E.Y.E. Every part of the game can be played cooperatively - or competitively - in multiplayer to further demonstrate the beautiful chaos of the games' overwhelming array of options.There is simply no way to properly explain E.Y.E.'s story and atmosphere. Even those people - such as myself - who have finished the game to its fullest extent still struggle to understand it. It is best described, albeit insufficiently, as every dystopian sci-fi universe in fiction smashed together and explained by a frenchman on 400 tons of LSD via Google Translate. And that's just the tutorial.E.Y.E. is dark, depressing, and its story will make the game feel hopelessly futile in the end - in a good way. Its lightless levels require permanent flashlight usage and often are so dark that even the flashlight is useless. Its music is pure brilliance that, once again, demonstrates how unnervingly powerful the game is despite its inexhaustible list of quirks.The quirks, however, aren't all good. It's clear very early on that the game may as well have been made exclusively in a shed after happy hour as it runs on Valve's Source engine, relies on Half-Life 2 content in a surprising number of places, and features models that run the gamut between professional quality to downright goofy.The prior mention of a frenchman on 400 tons of LSD is likewise accurate. E.Y.E. is the product of a French indie studio with a limited translation budget, leaving much of the text - its primary means of story dialogue - terribly confusing, at best. Strange mission objectives and complex level design can sometimes exaggerate the effects of the poor translation to an extreme and hold up gameplay.Questionable weapon balance, random drop-influenced player upgrades, a tutorial that often seems insufficient for most new players, and sometimes obnoxious on-screen messages all contribute to how E.Y.E. can often seem like a steaming mess. Some systems are completely discarded as the game progresses and some statistics end up entirely useless, leaving balance in yet more disarray.After I'd finished with E.Y.E., however, it left a mark on me that has since changed my perspective on games and dystopian environments. It's made me wonder why so many big-budget games with more experienced and less-pressured staff have been little more than drops of rainwater compared to the ocean of potential that E.Y.E., in all its indie-to-the-bone glory, is.And I still can't find my legs.

												An amazingly atmospheric and deeply complex game for those that can look past it's flaws. It's one of my all time favorites, but I'll be the first to admit it's not for everyone. You owe it to yourself to try the demo. The first level is one of the best so it should tell you if this game is for you or not.			",385,117,9,64,29,4,38

												What E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy boils down to is that if you like bad translations, flawed gameplay, but an overall brilliant vision, you will enjoy the game.E.Y.E. is essentially a cyberpunk Deus Ex set in the Warhammer 40k setting. It's French and the translation is awful, but there is a community mod to fix that. The gameplay is standard first-person shooter fare, with RPG elements such as stats, critical hits and misses (the words '♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t! Ultra-failed attack! will become very familiar to you), and cyberpunk elements such as psionics and body augmentation. The graphics are standard Source mod fare (the game runs on the Source engine), but the soundtrack and overall sound design is good and the maps are some of the biggest the engine can support, and the overall atmosphere is top-notch, grim and dark and grimy, very reminiscent of Alien and Blade Runner.The gameplay is a little repetitive and the story is incomprehensible at points, but the main charm to E.Y.E. is all of the things it attempts to do. There are hacking minigames where you can kill or take control of any enemy (except the Neo-streumonic force), even turrets and gunships - but what they boil down to is spamming commands while watching a bar fill up. Stealth gameplay is attempted, with cloaking devices and line of sight - but because of engine limitations, all of the NPCs know where you are at all times and simply choose to ignore you until you trigger them. The list goes on and it is essentially pointless to go through everything the game tries to do but does not succeed at. The leveling mechanics are flawed, the unlocking mechanics even worse, playing at higher difficulties without min-maxing like crazy is the definition of tedium, but the guns feel good to shoot, the melee weapons feel good to use, the game looks good, and it has a wild charm to it that, in my opinion, overrides all of the negatives to it.You should play E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy because of all it attempts to do; even though it doesn't succeed on many fronts, the sheer scope of its endeavor will be more than enough to satisfy.

												Do you enjoy smooth, satisfying gunplay? A story so convoluted that the gordian knot is jealous? Abilities and gameplay so over the top it's like you're living in Warmhamer 40,000? Then this is the game for you.Keeping it brief:+Gunplay, melee, abilities are almost all viable and incredibly satisfying+Story is incredibly convoluted, it takes multiple playthroughs with varying paths and snooping for secrets to discover the truth, if there is any.+Campaign provides meaningful choices and branching paths, each with unique rewards and challenges.+In-depth customization that can cater to any play style from stealth sniper, to hacker-ninja, to psionic swordsman, to walking tank, to minigun-toting murdermachine, and so on.+Game has robust settings for gameplay, including the altering and removal/addition of different mechanics (the most noticable being enemy reinforcements.)+Game has a variety of entertaining multiplayer modes, including co-op missions with randomly generated objectives, co-op for the campaign, and interesting PvP gametypes like Battle Royal.-Game's story is incredibly convoluted, you will never know what's going on.-No, seriously, you never have the slightest ♥♥♥♥ing clue.-Translation, while amusing, can lead to several frustrating situations and misunderstandings.-Clunky tutorials system is delivered in videos (Though the videos themselves are very informative and helpful!)-Hosting multiplayer servers and game stability in general can be an issue, especially on less powerful machines and when alt-tabbing.Highly reccomended, great fun with friends, buy it for you and everyone you know because it's literally 99c right now.

												You're allowed to like this game, but what other reviewers have said is quite true: It's a love it or hate it game, and I hated it. Something about the atmosphere felt very dry and devoid of life. You walk through huge, empty maps with nothing in the way of NPCs except for the people you have to fight and talk to for quests. The music loops through the menus and locations instead of changing based on where you are or what you are doing, so you might as well just listen to your own music while you play. The poor translation from the french language makes the writing look really sloppy and keeps you from being even remotely engaged with the story. Respawning enemies is such a poor design choice that I can't even begin to describe how much it hurts the game. It's like someone challenged the developers to find the worst possible subgenre of the worst possible genre to have respawning enemies, so they picked FPS/RPG.On the plus side, co-op is really easy to get into and is pretty fun. Graphically, the game looks sharp and the animations, while imperfect, are ahead of the curve for an indie title. Just be prepared for a very confusing experience if you choose to try this game out. Do NOT be expecting Deus Ex.			",249,44,4,13,35,0,46

												I really doubt people are gonna see this since I'm writing a review today on January 22, 2017 for a game that was released on July 29, 2011 but anyways here I go.First of all, this game is a real hidden gem the game is quite addicting to me at least but the grind can easily be done with a shortcut through an exploit xD but whatever this game is really good the mechanics like hacking, psi powers, equipment, armory, etc. are good and i'm saying that for a game that was made on the source engine I really wish this game would gain fame or popularity but I doubt that's gonna happen so to end this review i'd just like to say that I really recommend this game.edit:If you're really impatient and that you are not someone who is just ""easy going"" when playing games then you might find it hard to learn or understand this game but honestly the game offers tons of tutorial guides in-game.

												Underrated.+RPG+Fun weapons and abilitys+Good progression+Interesting story+Its a little wierd but the world is very interesting+AI are fun to mess with-Its exceedingly easy to get lost and very confused in this game.-Some of the story and core elements are poorly presented and not really explained.-Could have used more lore. This is a negative point because some enemies and spawns left me confused as well as NPCs that do little for the area and or its relation to the story. This lack of background info/lore hurt my exp.Overall this is one of my fav games to just sit back and mess around with. Its not heavy modding and console command friendly but the power given to you ingame allows for a lot of fun. It also provides you with large detailed areas to explore and fight through, each that can be replayed solo or with friends in a number of differant gametypes.The RPG system and inventory setup make for just as much stratigy as skill shot based combat.9:10Hours of fun for RPG fps gamers.Note: that its not supported by devs anymore, as far as I can tell so no DLCs, updates and probly no sequil. Though from my, admittedly lacking, exp with the story there doesnt need to be a sequil.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												- - - this review is a work in progress - - -Captivated.This is one of few games that completely got to me. I just can't get enough.It is an old school action RPG FPS, a dark yet playful, visceral shooter with high player agency and smooth, hectic coop or PvP action.The good+ Excellent gothic cyberpunk atmosphere (flavours of Aliens, Ghost in the Shell, Blade Runner, Warhammer 40.000, Shadowrun)+ Intriquing strangeness; bafflement, not knowing is an important story element+ I enjoyed figuring out the game (for some it remains confusing)+ Great music+ Power trip: jump high, fall from great hights, stomp, run fast, PSI powers, Cyber Implants, awesome weapons+ Low price+ Source Engine+ Sniping is satisfying+ Sword fighting, blocking, dual wield 2 kinds of swords with 2 different pistols+ Movement: falling acceleration is so spot on I feel it in my Solar Plexus; there is momentum when stopping from running+ Physics, ragdolls, floating, dismemberment+ Can move objects with PSI like with the Half Life 2 Gravity Gun, throw for damage, build barricades, trap NPCs, kill a monster with the severed arm of it's mate, reorganize rooms, throw bottles, break in windows...+ Over the top action, explosions, bodies flying, dodging fireballs and rockets, panic and mayhem+ Ingame video tutorials (!)+ Hacking minigame is tense, challenging, interesting; can posess enemies+ Challenging, but not unforgiving. Mistakes are not final. Wowen into story.+ Open maps, open gameplay (alternate routes and solutions)+ Maps are beautiful, well designed, often grandiose with lots of verticality+ Character progression+ Mental balance; can have panic, hallucinations+ Story is... interesting and confusing+ Branching, tricky conversations, some of them heavily affecting the storyline+ Voice acting+ AI uses grenades well, gets into cover, flanks+ Cooperative campaign and missions+ Anyone can host a server (forward these ports: TCP 27015, 27020-27039 and UDP 1200, 27000-27050) more info[eye.streumon-studio.com]+ Coop is awesome!+ PvP is hilarious, tense, skill-based (Battle Royal and Team Artifact)+ A game where it is okay to just watch others do their thing+ Can disable crosshair for added immersion+ Ingame voice gets reverb effect in appropriate environments+ ADS (aiming down sights) well implemented, beautiful weapons+ Blocking, good melee, excellent swordfighting+ Configurable radial menu+ Leaning keeps the weapon sights horizontal (should not tilt world though)+ Can use zoomed scopes to aim PSI/Cyber skills+ Water and underwater visuals and sounds+ Motion blur and vision focus well implemented+ Independently developed by a team of 12+ Loading screens have interesting quotes and useful tips+ AI can turn against each other+ Friendly AI can turn against you if damaged or insulted in a conversation (without breaking campaign progress)The bad- AI knows where you are even when it should not know, and pursues - stealth not an option- Respawning enemies are frustrating (arrival via transportation like the HL2 dropships would be better)- Annoying user experience: conversation sub-endings center the pointer, some screens can only be escaped via mouse clicking, cannot voice chat while in interface, mission ending screen covers chat and we can only move and jump but AI is still attacking...- No dedicated servers without lag from EU- Netcode not the best (with ping 140, single fire guns fire twice, no sound of own shots sometimes, laggy)- Typos and translated-from-French quirkiness- In a way it is a Half Life 2 mod, a total conversion (ladder climbing sound, sentry, scarab, grenades, enemy soldier melee...)- AI does not look for cloaked player, no AI uses EYE vision to see through cloak, they don't climb ladders, they don't jump to reach their enemies, they ignore flashlights and shadows- Aiming is cluttered (simple to fix with a mod)- Leaning tilts world (but keeps sights horizontal)- Some teleport gates put you facing backwards or sidewaysThings I would love to see modded into the game- freeaim, freelook- alternative crosshair: aiming dot- separate, shorter reload animations for when reloading while not empty: without chambering the first round (for some guns)- Mumble plugin for positional voice (cannot use ingame voice while in menu, Source Engine version does not support positional audio)- stop AI at the mission complete screen- display chat messages while in armory/character sheet- ability to see the last 10 chat messages- stronger flashlight with bigger range (mod solves this)- sliding, dodging, wall-jumpingTips and notes- sprint cancels aim (with scopes with two levels of zoom, this is much faster then clicking twice)- crouching improves accuracy, recharges energy and activates cyber jump (extended actions mod enables toggling)- server admin can 'kick <user>', 'mp_restartgame <seconds>', list 'maps *', start 'map <mapname>'- there is forums.steampowered.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=1179 and steamcommunity.com/app/91700/discussions and eye.streumon-studio.com- first playthrough took me to level 24, second to 38, third to 41 (coop only)- game tracks solo and coop campaign separately, in coop only the 'master of fate' progresses his/her campaign- there is a big difference between Master and Ghost difficulty: in Ghost the AI instakills via headshots often- the game assigns numbers to inventory items in order of putting them in, but then from top to bottom, left to right (katana is 1, but can be changed in Options, where I have 3-1-5-4-2 to have primary-secondary-sword-grenade-medkit; messes with Battle Royal though, where first weapon is 1, katana is 2)- armour makes a huge difference- crouched moving is not slow if unencumbered- turrets, clones, sentrys and scarabs will shoot you if you are in their line of fire- aiming HUD and scopes can be decluttered with [url][/url] and [url][/url]- beware of sneaky gunships: on higher difficulties the ones with rockets insta-kill, you have 1-2 seconds to hide or shoot them down- try playing without the crosshair, especially if you don't use the PSI powers much- it is cheesy, but collecting fatal injuries allows more points to be spent on them- SPOILER: campaign map order is: tuto > temple1 > tuto2 > new_eden > temple2 > forgotten > temple3 >  sheep > temple 4 > monolith > noctis > ... ...

												E.Y.E. is unlike anything you will ever play.Let me start out by saying this game is VERY confusing, even with tutorials you will still be lost. It took me quite awhile to understand the basics of the game. Any ailiments you encounter remember to press C, it is a life saver.The game is set in a futuristic cyberpunk world, with some very impressive levels, Great care and love was put into this games setting. Half of the time playing I would set there being in awe, the city levels in particular are gorgeous.The gameplay itself is where the game really shines, nothing is more satisfying than cutting an enemy with a sword only for them to explode into pieces. Any enemy you killed gains you brouzoufs, which can be used for different upgrades or can be used for research to increase your stats.One of my main gripe is the hacking part of the game, nothing about it was enjoyable which can lead to some frustrating encounters. If you failing hacking your character can be killed, so you have to watch your hp all the time. If you can look past some of it's problem, you've got a real hidden gem on your hands.

												If someone would ask me to name an example of an ""uncut diamond"" among games, E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy would be my answer. Not only that, but I would even call it the very definition of it. It has massive amounts of content, ideas, lore and features, all crammed together to a confusing, unpolished and clunky mess that is very rough around the edges. This game somehow manages to be both amazing and awful at the same time. It doesn't hold your hand and includes many things that aren't properly explained.E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy (subsequently called EYE) is a FPS/RPG hybrid. You'll spend most of your time going around sending your enemies to the game's equivalent of an afterworld. Through occasional dialogue, usually between missions, you can catch glimpses of the story, which you can try to put together yourself if you're up for a headache.Killing enemies rewards experience and currency that can be used to upgrade your character's stats and CyberTech (mechanized bodyparts), as well as to unlock new weapons, PSI powers and cybernetic implants. As you progress through the game, you can really feel how all the tiny upgrades come together for a huge boost in power. When you start out, your character can panic at the mere sight of a monster and gets his legs broken in almost every gunfight. After many hours of progress, you control an unstoppable death machine that jumps and teleports through the world, leaving even the strongest enemies at his mercy.One of EYE's strongest points is the visual design. Set in a futuristic cyberpunk world, the artstyle looks surreal and mysterious. It's easy to see that this game took inspiration from works such as Blame! and numerous others.The leveldesign is great. EYE has a rather small number of maps you'll encounter during the single-player campaign and can revisit for side missions at any time. They are large and nonlinear, with many different paths and corridors, and have unique themes and styles. The maps play more like ""arenas"" than traditional maps. When you're dropped into one of these for a mission, you're often required to find a far away objective while fighting off an endless number of constantly respawning enemies. This can be very annoying and even frustrating for newer players, but for the more experienced, it keeps the gameplay fresh and adds a lot of replay value. The detail put into these maps is impressive, especially given their size.However, the size and nonlinearity of certain maps can make them difficult to navigate. New players may find themselves aimlessly wandering in circles while fighting off the respawning enemies for an hour or more while trying to find that one mission objective with no idea how to get there.The game gives you access to a vast arsenal of tools to deal with your enemies. You start out with a number of weapons, and can unlock more from vendors after you've upgraded the necessary stats or completed certain research projects. Most weapons feel and sound satisfying and are fun to use, but once you progress to the later levels and start encountering enemies with armor, you'll notice an imbalance towards the few armor-piercing weapons. EYE does have some kind of bullet physics, which doesn't seem to be particularly consistent and can make it very hard to hit moving targets at a distance. Even close up, enemies strafing around you can be a challenge to hit. It feels more like lag and affects just you, but not NPCs.Once you've sufficiently upgraded your stats and arsenal of PSI powers, you can deal with enemies like a spellcaster, making them explode with your mind. You can also buy a number of implants for support skills that let you cloak, increase weapon accuracy, see through walls, reduce incoming damage and more.Unfortunately, both PSI powers and cybernetic implants require energy to use, the same energy that is also consumed by running and jumping, and you lack the means to reliably restore this energy on characters that aren't highly upgraded. What that means in practice is that you can use these tools only sparingly for a major part of your character's life while playing similar to a run-of-the-mill FPS, until you get certain powers, implants and CyberTech upgrades, after which you can spam these abilities as much as you want.When you're tired of killing your enemies, you can start hacking. Hacking is one of the game's main features in the form of a minigame, and you can do a lot of things with it. It lets you open doors, steal money or energy, make enemies explode, turn hostiles into allies to kill each other, and more.Personally, I found the hacking minigame to be annoying, frustrating even without a high stat in it. And the game forces you to hack on multiple occasions to open doors, or you cannot progress further. Although dependant on your hacking stat, it is still somewhat random in nature, and sometimes the enemy has much higher stats than you, which leads to unwinnable scenarios. Even defeating evenly matched opponents in the minigame can take quite some time, and while you're stuck in the menu, you are fully vulnerable. Since most maps have respawning enemies, you can (and most probably will) be interrupted by an attacker at any time. This is likely to happen even if you find some remote corner before your attempt. A character highly skilled in hacking has the potential to horribly mess with his enemies, but you're almost required to do all hacking before your cloak runs out of energy.The single-player campaign consists of a number of levels you can count on your fingers. If you only do the strictly necessary objectives, the game is pretty short. An experienced player with an upgraded character can complete the campaign in under an hour, while a new player should be done within a handful of hours, provided he/she doesn't get horribly lost on Noctis aka Mars.Where EYE really shines is the replay value, thanks to the large arena-like maps with respawning enemies and side missions that can add countless hours of fun. It also is said to be a great co-op and multiplayer experience, though I cannot comment on that because I've never done anything but single-player.EYE has plenty of both good and bad things about it. However, the bad stuff is mostly of the ""newbie-crusher"" type, that makes this game somewhat hard to get into because you don't know anything about how it works, or can't find your way around the nonlinear levels, or get obliterated by enemies you don't know how to deal with. Once you learn the mechanics and memorize the maps, many of the issues become nonexistant, while you grow accustomed to others. For someone just picking EYE up, the bad might outweight the good, but the longer you play and the more you learn about the game, the more this balance will shift towards the good. After a few dozen hours I have come to terms with most of the shortcomings and accepted them as features that ultimately make EYE to what it is as a whole.			",71,3,0,7,1,0,2

												You gain BrouzoufYou gain BrouzoufYou gain BrouzoufMy legs are OKYou gain BrouzoufYou....This game is a bit confusing at first, however once you take the time to sit down, read dialogue and learn the mechanics it is an amazingly fun fps/rpg. EYE is like a Russian Warhammer 40k mixed with ShadowRun, CyberPunk 2020 and D&D. You're in the future running around different planets in medieval armor, have cybernetic enhancements and magic all at once. The game is not forgiving for failure at all. If you fail to hack even a door or a bank dispenser you can be counter hacked giving you a sort of Laughing Man esque face over your screen. To get rid of this you have to then hack yourself. If you die, which is quite easy if not paying attention to your stats and ammo, you can get permanent wounds which reduce your stats. When single player isn't enough you can play the campaign in coop up to 32 players. The only downside is that there is no Friendly Fire, unless you backstab a friend with a melee weapon or give them a Medkit Overdose. Overall the game is very fun and a beautiful work of art once you get into it and soak it in.			",69,9,2,3,4,0,8

												Easily one of the hardest games to review, E.Y.E. is a game wherein you will have no idea what is happening on a gameplay level as you have no idea what is happening on a narrative level as you trapse through a cyberpunk world with an overly intricate history that will in turn intimidate you into questioning things even further.If you actually bother to bust through that wall of confusion, intimidation and minute complexity, you're going to be rewarded with an experience you're not liable to forget.Just understand you're going to have to spend at least 10-20 hours on the game just to understand what the hell is going on, and even then you may not truly piece things together once you have all the details.This is a very, very hard game to quantify on any level, as the player is handed incredibly overpowered abilities by the late-game, but the game acknowledges this and simply lets them have fun unless you raise difficulty, wherein you essentially need to be higher level to be on par.I recommend the game, but only if you're willing to jump into an ocean with no idea of how to swim, rather than experience the usual river most games provide, if not the kiddy pool you may be used to.

												This review might be a little lengthy and wordy, so I'm going to skip to the point.I have 30 hours on E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy. I have played through many optional paths, done side quests, and have probably completed this game about 4 times with different characters.This game, put bluntly, is bat%#@& insane. It has the depth of the atlantic ocean, the complexity of a 20-sided rubix cube, and the story-telling ability of a 7 year old high on acid.And it's wonderful.-----Still around? Wonderful.Let me tell you why this game is the best worst best game you will ever play. And I'll do it in the form of a story and example.I will playing with my friend in Co-op, and we were wandering through the first level. I was going for a heavy-armour wearing superman with my eyes set on a hammer that literally makes anything it hits explode. He was going for a more subtle, stealthy hacker.Very early on, in the first level, in fact, there is a bridge. A fairly long bridge with a deep hole to nothing but darkness beneath it.Having passed that same bridge countless times without thought, I decided to look around and see if I found any easter eggs. Lo' and behold, I found what looked like a small ventilation passage which we both jumped into.Now, considering I'm the beefstick here, I took point. Unfortunately, heavy armour is, well, heavy. And we, crouched down in this tiny whatever-it-was, were going at a snails pace. However, the tension in the atmosphere was almost palpable. It felt like an evil, twisted monstrosity would leap out of a small dark side passage at any point, and neither of us really *wanted* to go forward.So, take note of the following: The bridge has no enemies and we're moving slowly through an air duct.After about 20 minutes, maybe longer because of our bickering, we made it to the other side. I lept out joyously, about to explore this whole new area I'd never seen before. I turned right around and saw-The bridge.The bridge that takes about 30 seconds to cross.The bridge without any enemies, any dangers, or anything that could possibly be even remotely referred to as bad. Except maybe the texturing on some hazard paint.All that tension and build up was for nothing, and we both just burst out laughing-----Now, you might be wondering ""How the hell is that a positive for that game? That sounds like a complete waste of time"". And you'd be right, it was a complete waste of time.But it's also indicative of pretty much everything else in this game. I'm not gonna hide it, it's a janky game. It's got design decisions that any sane person would never consider. It's so weirdly obtuse in its workings and presentation that when something makes logical sense it seems completely out of order and strange. The movement between areas is jarring, where you can be fighting cyberminotaurs in a mining facility one moment, then be on desert Mars the next.You will then end the game, sit back, try to reallign your thoughts and what the hell just happened, and who was who. And then you'll start New Game+ or reroll and try again. And it'll be a fair bit of a different game this next time around.Wanna end the game halfway through and join the badguys? Sure, you can do that.Wanna sacrifice your soul to a cyberdemongod? Yeah, go for it.Feel like killing literally everyone who ever helped, supported, and cared about you from the start of the game, leading to you literally not being able to continue in the game? Yup. That's a thing you can do.-----This game is janky fun. It's a game that started showing the cracks of age from the moment it was released. But it's fun, it's weird as hell, and I really don't know to this day how it managed to be as much fun as it is.In fact, I'm considering playing it again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												E.Y.EThe only game I can think of where you can hack a door and the door can legitimately hack you back.It's actually a really fun cyberpunk game, but the problem with it is that it makes absolutely no sense, so don't try to make sense of it. It's a game in which you have a lot of options, it's pretty stable, and it has a lot of cool little features such as psi which allows you to do...well...pretty much anything I can think of, go invisible, give you better hacking, night vision, jump high.So where does E.Y.E start? I have no ♥♥♥♥ing clue, apparently in the middle of some war that's never explained beyond some alien race is strong enough to take over the human race with their awesome cyber powers or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ I got that from wikipedia so it's probably not real, it basically throws you into the game and gives you 23 tutorial videos, you have to watch them and they're so gruellingly long, jesus christ it took me like 5 minutes to watch all them.There's a lot of GUIs, and the GUIs are very unique, none of the game is in English (I honestly don't even know what language it is in.) the gunplay is fun, but the AI is very well...not so smart, you're definitely not going to get S.T.A.L.K.E.R. AI in this game, it seems like the AI phases out of the floor (not kidding.) and they'll just pile at you one by one into a room where you mow them down with a minigun that takes 5 shots to kill (that's not a joke, by the way.)You talk to NPCs to buy stuff, but you need to be a certain rank and have the certain skills in specific classes, not to mention the gun selling NPC is a ♥♥♥♥ing jew and jews you out of 600,000 brozoufs (this game's currency) and it seems every NPC is the same, they give you boring one liners that make you feel lost and uninvolved in the game.The textures are that of a Source game and feel extremely unpolished, it seems blue is the theme of the entire game, everything is blue except the player models which are mostly yellow and black, it feels like the models in the game are polished with a beautiful phong but everything else just feels like it was made in 5 minutes because they were running out of time on their deadlines.The music? It's great, I'm not much of an in-game music fan because I like to substitute my own music, but what little I heard of it was very impressive from such a small development team (I believe it was 12 people?)The gunplay isn't actually half bad, it's really fun to just blow people's heads off (yes, you can do that.) repeatedly, not to mention sometimes you get shot by people you can't even see, little can you expect it, there's people that go invisible, rockets, and other cool little things that really just make gunplay well...fun...it's not rewarding, but it's not awful.Hacking? Oh god it's confusing, very confusing, but once you get hold of it it's actually extremely fun to do, the hacking can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥at first but what comes out of it is awesome. Failing to hack a helicopter 6 times, getting to hack it, and then watching it drive by and shoot the hell out of enemy soldiers is always a fun thing to watch.The language really makes you feel out of place, like you don't belong, and a lot of interesting stuff happens in the game but none of it seems to make sense because you have no clue what's going on, so if you have to know what's going on in a game to enjoy it, E.Y.E is not your game.The missions are honestly, really dreadful to go through, it's basically your usual ""go here do that"" mission, go here, kill this captain, go to the other side of the map, plant this bomb...but the thing about it is, it gives you markers but it doesn't baby you through it so in looking for a mission, you can often end up in other places on total accident, most of which are actually really, really interesting to take a look at. I remember specifically on the 2nd level with your mentor, there's a tunnel and inside of it, well...on second thought, I'll let you find it.In conclusion?:Music: 8/10, it's good, but it's not my type.Models, textures, missions?: This is a hard part to rate, the models are beautiful but the textures and missions are dreadful. 6/10.Gameplay, gunplay?: I'd give this a solid 9/10, it's FUN, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, just shoot and kill.Interaction (menus, AI)?: I have to give this a really generous 5/10, I just can't follow it, the boring one liners and the half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tutorials leave a really bad taste in my mouth, you basically have to figure out what the hell is going on by reading books in the archive of New Eden. It's pretty awful, honestly.All in all?: I'd give this a generous 7/10, because I'm a sucker for games with a good atmosphere, it gives me a really STALKER-esque feel and that makes me give it a higher review than I would. I would recommend it to STALKER fans, but not many other people, hence the ""would you recommend this?"" Yes, but only to die hard cyberpunk/STALKER fans.TL;DR?It's okay, it's rough around the edges but if you can look around the problems, underneath lies a really fun gameplay experience.

												I don't think I have ever both loved and yet been so disappointed with a game before.  E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy is a FPS/RPG hybrid that seems to have some inspiration from the original Deus Ex, but plays more like the quick Source engine shooters such as Half Life and Counter Strike you would most likely be familiar with. However, while the shooting and gunplay is very solid, the rpg side of the game is severly lacking and as you get further into the main story missions you find yourself with less and less variety in how you can approach situations in the game.Creating a character takes you to a small menu where you can mix, match, and reroll three genes that will determine your characters base statistics.  You essentially play as a sword/gun wielding cyborg samurai with an aggresive behavior and poor social skills. Once you create the character, the game starts you off in a dream sequince as you begin talking to yourself in a made up language and enter a portal to find yourselff lost in a cave with amnesia.  You'll progress through the cave where we will run into the first major problem of the game, the tutorial system.  The tutorial videos are rather poorly labeled, as an example: you will be told to look up the super jump tutorial in order to make a higher out of reach jump, but there isn't one by that name and you'll end up fumbling around in the videos until you do come across how the skill wheel works. Once you do manage to find your way out of the tutorial level, you return to the games HUB world and rejoin the faction you work for, the Culter Dei, and begin taking orders from Commander Rimanah, your superior.  You'll be sent to do various tasks in various environments that are fairly large in size and quite eye catching as well with varied styles from a large run down city to the surface of Mars.  Moving through these maps will be confusing at first but will be fine once memorized. Enemies primarily fall into three catagories, or so I would assume, humanoids, machines, and monsters.  Humanoids are pretty much your standard gun wielding baddy that fall into several factions such as the looters, Federation cops, Jian, etc, the machines are pretty much small turrets and gunships, and the monsters, known as the Meta-streumonic force, are primarily melee ranged little creatures such as imps, small aliens, werewolves, women clad in white, and the cyber demon from doom.  Most enemies are pretty fun to fight and add a decent amount of variety to the game.As you progress you will level up your charcter and accumulate the games currancy known as Brouzoufs.  Each level up gives you skill points you can allocate into the eight primary skills your character has while the money you gain will be spent at the various shops for new cyber abilities, psi abilities, and weapons, used for research to unlock upgrades or stat bonuses, and to upgrade the cyber implants in your character.  While there are eight differnt stats to spend points in, you'll soon find out that the increases are very minor and specialized characters will find themselves having a difficult time.  If you wanted to play as a high strength melee character, a sneaky hacker who turns his foes on one another, or a mind crushing psi powered god you will be severly disappointed.  Melee will quickly become a series of deaths as you run out of stamina far too quicly when blocking enemy fire, hacking becomes less effective on groups and takes far too long to accomplish leaving you open to ambushes, and the harder foes are pretty much immune to psi abilities.  As you get to the harder missions in the game you will be falling back primarily on using gunfire to take down the strongest opponents.  Speaking of gunfire, the game has a decent variety of weapon catagories from melee, pistols, smgs, shotguns, sniper rifles, assault rifles, and heavy weapons each having two to four weapons to choose from.  However, a major issue with the weapon variety comes from how useful certain weapons become later in the game.  While you can get through the first four or so story missions using pretty much any weapon you like, you will hit a major standstill when you start to fight heavily armored enemies.  These enemies will force you into using specific weapons that use armor piercing ammo, which would be fine if there were more than just four to choose from.  To my knowledge the only guns with armor piercing rounds are one of the pistols, two of the snipers, and one of the heavy weapons.  I was playing primarily with shotguns and SMG's for most of the game, but there are no armor piercing shotguns and SMGs, so I was forced to use one of the starting sniper rifles in order to progress.  This is a major negative to me, as I was expecting pretty much anything I enjoyed using to remain viable throughout the game.  (Except for the Betty Boom sawn off shotgun, that gun is in its own league of bad which is a shame because I loved the way it looked.)Character interaction is pretty entertaining,  you'll find yourself talking to NPC's constantly.  The game has a standard choose your dialog option, and most responses are pretty goofy.  Hell, just the normal NPC dialog is a real joke in it's own right as you find many aggresive, dumb, depressed, or just outright insane characters through out the game to talk with. When it really comes down to it, everyone is pretty much a huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in this game as I don't think I found a single pleasant person to talk to outside of Tobi.There is a story, but I'm not even going to pretend to know it or explain it, if you buy the game good luck with that.Overall I really enjoy this game so far and will continue to keep playing but I cannot recommend it.  Most people will find themselves clueless with what to do at the start of the game and won't even get to my major complaints.  The game feels like a proper structure of a great game but clearly isn't finished.  Do not be fooled by the early trailers of this game, you will not be taking out groups in various ways as shown, you will eventually be shooting for the majority of the game.Things that need to be changed, in my opinon, to make the game into a proper or better FPS/RPG are as follows:Viable playstyles for every stat choice.  If I want to go full melee, I should be able to.  If I want to stack hacking and hack every enemy and clear a mission that way, I should be able to.  If I want to use shotguns as my only weapon, I should be able to.Strength should also decrease the amount of stamina you lose per point when blocking and the damage bonus should be buffed significantly.Wider variety in Psi powers and psi should have a chance to work on all opponents.All guns should be viable throughout the game or at the very least one weapon from each catagory should have armor piercing.Class system should actually do something outside of get achievements, each class honestly should have either a special trait linked to them or some kind of passive bonus at the least.Medicine stat should not only increase your healing effectiveness but increase lethality when medkit is used on opponents.  Not being able to cloak around and inject enemies to death is a huge missed opportunity.Level cap so there is a reason to build a character a certain way, I haven't tested yet but I'm certain it is possible to max all skills on a single character.  It would be far more interesting to have proper character builds instead of being a jack of all trades.Stat penalties on death should be healed by an NPC for money instead of getting a research to remove and be immune to them.It's a real shame but the game is most likely never going to be patched again as I'm certain the last one was two years ago and has now been abandoned.  ♥♥♥♥ I really wanted to say this was a good game but I honestly cannot, this game is not for most people.

												TL;DR: WTF?????!!!!!!I bought this game for 1€ long time ago and tried to play it, I was really expecting some cyberpunk Deus Ex game and was greatly dissapointed with what I got.The game is EXTREMELY NOT beginner friendly and very unforgiving, nothing is explained, or at least explained enough and you are just thrown inside with no idea of what you are doing.I ended up uninstalling it but somehow I knew I was missing out on something, I still did not know if it was something good or not, but I definetly knew the game had a lot of depth I had not figured out yet.Anyway I reinstalled it, read around in the wiki, the steamhub, and gave it a real try.Once I have really seen how it is, I can really say that Deus Ex is not the game you should be comparing this game to, but STALKER.You are thrown into a very dangerous and abandoned world, with a few armed NPCs you can talk to, some factions fighting among themselves and a lot of side missions.*** Negative points:- There are no civilians or innocents bystanders whatsoever in any of the maps, not even in the missions that are supposed to be happening in the city (which was a big letdown if you are expecting a deus ex game).- Enemies keep spawning after you clear an area, sometimes you can even see them respawn.- The User Interface is extremely unfriendly, it really takes a while to understand how it works, specially the hacking mini game, which is quite fun once you understand how it works (which takes a while because the tutorial sucks big time).- The game engine used is source which feels quite outdated today.- No manual saving.*** Positive points:- Characters are extremely interesting, even if they are not voiced acted at all (again, STALKERish). - You really feel the depth of the story and how enigmatic everything is and curiosity just makes you want to keep on playing just for the sake of the lore and the story. With out any doubt this is its STRONGEST POINT. I mean just look at the images, don't you want to know more about this world?- Headshots are extremely satisfactory.- Different endings, one of them is a secret one which can only be unlocked when you have reached all the differente endings which require a new playthrough each time (because you can't save). You won't understand any of them, as there's a lot of mysticism, allegories, philosophy and surrealism around them, but it is interesting to see the different theories people come up with in the steamhub.- New Game+ : you can (and should if you want to see the endings) play the game endlessly with all the augmentations/skills/weapons you have unlocked so far. Actually the player repeating the campaign is part of the campaign itself as you are supposed to be stucked in some cycle repeating itself that in theory only finishes with the secret ending mentioned before. Something like Groundhound day.*** ConclusionPlay this game if you liked STALKER, really make the effort of investing enough time to understand the mechanics because I guarantee you that it is worth it.I really think this game could have been MUCH better if it had been done slightly different, and I really hope a sequel is done sometime in the future which takes care of all these shortcomings.

												When I first read the reviews for this game, I assumed I would end up either playing a barely coherent, glitchy mess that one can only squeeze a mote of enjoyment from due to its inherent jank, or I'd get a barely coherent but functioning game that gets a passing grade only because of how much effort went into it.Neither of these scenarios ended up being the case. What $2.50 bought me is one of the strangest, deepest FPS RPG hybrids I've ever played, and I've only put 15 hours into it so far. I've dug up inches of dirt in the face of a mountain. On some level, I expected a Deus Ex like experience, and on some level, I got that. I also got Half Life, Ghost in the Shell, Warhammer 40k, and the ocassional feeling of Goldeneye, all while on what seems to be a quest to reach nirvana. This game is everywhere, and somehow it works. There's almost nothing I can say that hasn't been said before. The story isn't even something I can get into. Without a doubt, everything about this game is something that feels rewarding when the player discovers it, and that's just it - the player has to discover everything. If you came here looking for a game that tells you a story, you've come to the wrong place. You have to beg this game to give you its story, and when it does, it'll give it to you in the form of legends, hearsay, and double talk. The sense things make is the sense you give to it. The enemy AI is surprisingly intelligent and offers up a challenge not in terms of firepower, but actually acting like humans would in a real firefight. They take meaningful cover and fire back aiming to kill. Think you're about to sneak past someone? You better have found a way to be invisible and make not a sound, or else someone is giong to notice you. Likewise, your AI allies don't suddenly become bumbling morons, but can quickly end up taking out just as many or more enemies than you. Sprinkle friendly fire on top and suddenly everything feels very hectic and realistic. That's something that really sticks out to me - despite the subject matter, everything feels strangely realistic, while also staying firmly in the uncanny valley. The levels are massive and sparsely populated, but filled in from corner to corner. That being said, it still lacks something... even though it's gritty and grungy and obviously lived in, it doesn't feel ""alive"". There have been instances where I wanted to stop playing the game because things were getting just a little too uncanny, like the worlds in an N64 game - that kind of feeling. The very dated and strange looking NPC models don't do much to take away from that, but it almost feels like the surrealism is intentional. And did I say the levels are massive? Supermassive might be a proper term for it. There's FPS games that lead you down a hallway, and there's FPS games with multiple hallways, and then there's E.Y.E. There's what feels like miles of terrain that go almost entirely unused, or connect actually useful areas of a map to each other, adding to the realistic feel, even if it sacrifices convenience in most areas. The best I can equate it to is like going to Wal-Mart to buy bread, and then walking to the tire section. Duh, nothing you came for is going to be there, but there's something nice about knowing that the area is fleshed out enough to have that tire section.And hey, the more you discover, and the longer you play, the more you'll be looking everywhere but the bread aisle for the bread you so desperately want. You'll make visits to electronics and family planning, hoping for the day that you may find the special bread that they only stock in those departments.			",65,7,1,2,5,1,3

												Do you want to hit people with a hammer which causes nuclear explosions?Do you want to stumble through a next to incomprehensable story?Do you want a gun where the two fire modes are full auto and ""fuller""(?) auto?Do you want to pick up cars as if they were made of styrofoam?Do you want to get your brain hacked by a door?Do you want to play the campaign with 12 other players?Do you like Warhammer 40k?Then this game might be for you. -----The Good-----The gun play and the weapons themselves.Like I said, there is a gun which empties a 100 round magazine in under 3 seconds.And a hammer which blows people up in gigantic explosions. Enough said.The atmosphere.If you like Warhammer 40k and dystopian/cyberpunk SCI-FI future, you will feel right at home.The cool things that can be done with abilities.There is a skill which allows you to teleport inside of enemies and blow them up from within, at least, that's what I think happens, not sure on that one. Increasing your psychic skill also allows you to pick up cars and throw them at people.ReplayabilityThe game loops when you finish the story, there is a story reason for that and you should totally play again because there are multiple endings and the chance that you actually understod the story first time around is slim to none. There's also a ""freemode"" which can be compared to the adventure mode in Diablo 3. -----The Bad -----Explaining itself.It has an atrocious lack of explaning mechanics, the deep RPG system and the backstory of the game world to the player.The tutorial consists of a list of videos with short explenations on most subjects.And it throws you in the deep end right from the get go, this is going to turn some people off and it's really holding this game back from being more popular than it is.The AIThey're braindead.The UIIt's bad, really bad.The English translation.Lots of people complain about it, I didn't find it to be too bad.I still understood what was being said.There's also an unofficial patch which fixes it.There's more, but those are the biggest problems I have with the game.But should you buy it?Maybe.Im going to be honest, this game is not for everyone.If you're going into it expecting a great or even at first comprehensible story, you will be disappointedIt's okay though, the game's strength is it's gameplay, atmosphere and just being quirky and weird.It's far from flawless, but it has it charm and I consider it to be one of the best indie gems I've ever played.Buy it with a friend and run through the campain together.Have a fun time shooting some bad guys, gaining some brouzouf and checking your legs.

												Where to start? This game is awful, and you probably shouldn't buy it. I bought it, and I am me. You are you. Though when we talk about E.Y.E. the line between you and I goes a little haywire... a bit like the entire human race getting turned into red soup, E.Y.E. is a postmodern, zen, syncretist dystopian shooting game. In this world you're a cyborg. Nothing really makes any sense, and whatever meaning imposed on the world gets thrown away any time you try to make sense of it. The narrative jumps around and is the experiences of a schizophrenic person. It's like the very first version of Pathologic- a game by an unrelated studio, Ice Pick Lodge- in that whatever English translation has been done isn't really... ""done."" Even with fixes and updates it doesn't change the obscurity and esoteric nature of the story.Did I start by saying this game is awful? Well, it's... awful in that way that Turkish Star Wars or classic Doctor Who is: it's ♥♥♥♥ing strange, goofy, and a bit bad looking at times. It is, however, crazy and fun and has a great sense of imagination. At least that one crazy ♥♥♥♥♥ on the block was a good lay, I suppose. You wouldn't marry him/her but you'd chill out and smoke pot until the knife got pulled on the step-dad and you high-tailed it back home. If you like this game you'll probably sink deep into its madness and learn what's there. Otherwise you're gonna run around shooting things and damn it--- you don't need tutorials or any of that hardcore♥♥♥♥♥♥ you're just gonna learn as you go. That's not the developers' fault, you ignorant shmuck! That's your fault. This game is genius! It's just pointless genius wasted on dopes who can't see it for the shining gunplay, strange and often hilarious cyberpunk setting, and the deep and ♥♥♥♥ed up storyline. You have an app for fixing your damn legs and checking they are okay. You can hack people's brains. You can hack doors. Sometimes you can just hack some dumb♥♥♥♥♥♥ There are dinosaurs and xenomorph knock-offs that are the nightmares of humanity: this whole game is a ♥♥♥♥ing trip to shooty Serious Sam town, but it's actually a ♥♥♥♥ed up Shakespearean tragedy. It is the closest thing to Warhammer 40k's brutal grimdark universe in FPS form.""But this game is awful, dude!"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ right it is, but it's still better than most of the Call of Duty games that have come out since 2010. Since it's always on sale or is about to be on sale, get this game and talk♥♥♥♥♥♥about it because you played it, not because you heard about it. It is a one-of-a-kind sensory experience beyond imagining.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ever wondered what humanity was getting up to before the events of Warhammer 40k? Delve into the Age of Strife here with EYE: Divine Cybermnacy. It's Warhammer 20k!Great game, old school design ethos that doesnt hold you by the hand. Hundreds of options for character design. Good selection of weapons which all have unique behaviour. Not perfect but you'll come to love it, warts and all. If you like shooters and/or RPGs this is a game for you.And like the grim dark future of the 41st millenium everything is over the top, manly, batshit awesome. Clearly the devs tried sanity and found it boring. Pick it up today!			",140,32,1,31,1,1,9

												If you're bored of all those standard issue FPS games, E.Y.E. is definitely worth trying. Don't mistake this indie cyberpunk FPS for Deus Ex imitation, for it surely isn't. It has fresh ideas, vast well-designed levels, wide array of nice weapons, cybernetic skills and PSI powers and an interesting plot. The game is almost too ambitious for its own good, which makes it cumbersome at times and hard to approach. It has also some minor bugs yet to be squashed. But even with its flaws E.Y.E. is something very unique.The shooting is tight, the character progression is deep, the visuals aren't bad, and it's a hell of a lot of fun once you're able to jump 30 feet high, not to mention do everything else a cybernetic assassin is capable of.Taking into account the small development group and the price, I'm hard-pressed not to recommend this game as a must-have.Distinctive games like E.Y.E. are a rarity these days. Its colorful characters, good dialogue, entertaining non-linear story, and multiple ways to develop the main characters are enough to offset the shortcomings.			",2267,868,87,236,310,22,349

												This is definitely a love-it or hate-it kind of game. I happen to love it, but can definitely find some reasons not everyone would agree with this. The graphics aren't exactly cutting edge, but the world is really well designed and creates a really unique and interesting atmosphere that you genuinely enjoy exploring. The combat is great. Wide variety of weapons, abilities, and powers to choose from. Want to control the fight from afar? Try the 2-scope sniper rifle. Like a bit of melee? Try dual wielding some bullet-blocking katanas. Powers can be used to help give you an edge as well. You can use them to enhance your armor, see enemies through walls, hypnotize them, create clones of yourself to aid you in battle, etc. Lots of options that you can tailor to suit your favored play style.Now here's where some people might lose interest. For one, this is not exactly an easy game. Not that it's too difficult, just is a bit complex. There are a lot of different mechanics to consider, creating a higher learning curve than some might want. Despite the fact that there are in-game tutorials, not much is explained to you which leaves it to you to discover how things work. If you don't mind dedicating a bit of time to trial and error learning then you'll be rewarded with a really great experience.There's no save option, so in order to save your progress you have to complete the mission you're on. Some of the missions are a bit long, which can lead to some frustration if you're not able to dedicate the proper amount of time to playing and end up losing your progress. The game wasn't translated very well so some of what the NPCs say just comes off as plain silly. Personally, I find this to be humorous and actually like the little quirk it gives to the game. But if you want your dialogue to be clean-cut then this probably isn't the game for you. Overall, this is a great game and if you haven't been deterred thus far then I highly recommend giving it a shot.			",250,97,1,41,24,0,27

												Sometimes - very rarely, though - you encounter a game which you can only describe as a masterpiece. A game which obviously has its flaws, but also something very special about its atmosphere which completely makes up for them. This is entirely subjective and you may not agree, but E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy is such a game for me.Created by a small, independent studio, it confronts you with a creative mix of countless cyberpunk and sci-fi works, sometimes even directly adopting certain elements from these references into the game. It lets you create and enhance a character to your liking and play a weird, complex story. Being set in a grim future full of darkness and deceit, the game contains all the staples of a good dystopian world.As a member of a secret cultist society and elite warrior you are thrown into the world without any memory. Step by step, you progress through the story and learn more about the game's reality, or at least, you think so. You will soon learn that many things are not what they seem to be. Up until the end of the game, you will have many questions, just like the main protagonist. And if you are like me, you will take every chance to find the answers.In terms of gameplay, the game is solid: it features many classic projectile weapons (which are ancient by the standards of the time) and it has everything necessary to give you the typical shooter experience. But there is much more. Besides the melee weapons you have at your disposal, you can also make use of many PSI-powers which complement your personal play style. You can be a minigun-wielding juggernaut with near-impenetrable skin or a swift cyber-ninja with hacking skills and a cloaking ability.Some of the game's features are truly unique and turn out to be very interesting additions. For instance, if you are caught in the heat of the battle (or have a certain genetic predisposition) you can easily fall into madness which can manifest itself in five(!) different ways in the game. Besides your physical character, you have a virtual avatar as well, and can hack into computers or even people. But beware: Don't be too careless or your mind will fall victim to a counter hack and be possessed by a different digital avatar!The missions you get can be solved in many different ways, depending on your decisions and actions. There is no obviously good or bad path. You don't even know what's part of reality. Or if there even IS a reality! As you may have noticed by now, the game will not hold your hand. It is a diamond in the rough. Sometimes you will have problems, you may not progress the way you intended to, but the game still marches on. There are parts of the game you won't understand, but the only thing you can do is to make your way through and just experience it. Indulge yourself in the raw weirdness of the game.E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy makes use of the Source Engine and looks accordingly. Not too fancy by today's standards, but not ugly, either. In any case, the graphics are definitely of secondary concern in this game. I'm absolutely sure that you can't truly appreciate the game if you don't read what the characters are saying (text only) and also invest some thoughts regarding the meaning of what is said and done. It's not a game to play if you want to relax after a busy day, but a somewhat demanding (and rewarding) piece which could be compared to a story-driven movie or novel.All in all, the game's mixture of illusion and reality, science-fiction and mysicism, story and gameplay elements make it a memorable experience with great replay value. It is a unique experience which really stands out from the crowd.In short: I love this game.			",150,16,2,11,15,1,43

Posted: June 26, 2014
												I really should hate this game but I don't. I only give it a thumbs down because I can't really recommend it on good conscience, even if it is a guilty pleasure to me. Wait, I can recommend it as an example of what happens when a bunch of people on a forum start discussing their idea of a great game, then decide to make it a reality. They didn't quite have organizational skill to pull it off, but they definately tried. There are some good ideas in the game. Too bad there's twice the amount of bad ones. If only there was a 'thumb sideways' option.The first comparison that comes to mind is Deus Ex. The setting is as cyberpunk as it gets. There is a plot in there somewhere and quite a bit of lore, but I'm not sure even the developers knew where they were going with it. See, the first thing I realized playing was that English was not the makers' native tongue and the translation is cringe-worthy. It doesn't help the game is full of features and stats that are poorly (if at all) explained. The game plays like an FPS but everything is defined by stats. Let's just go over the good, bad and whatweretheythinking.Good: There is no permanent death. You have a defined amount of tries to get through a given level before getting kicked back into the hub area and having to try again.Bad: The game resurrects you right back in the same spot with full health but not full energy, so it's more than likely the same thing gets to kill you more than once.WTH: Dying can induce stat penalties that take a lot of grinding and resources to remove and happen randomly. Even if the cause of death was falling in a bottomless pit, which are common. Especially in the dark, non-combat hub area.Good: There is a comprehensive stat system you can set to either increase by what you do (ala Elder Scrolls) or by allocating points upon level-up.Bad: Some stats are way,WAY slower to level than others. Hacking seems impossible to raise while not using guns in a shooter is challenging to say the least.WTH: Since using points a stat gets more and more expensive to raise, sooner or later you will succumb to autoleveling, where a level up doesn't really mean anything. Despite what I try, the real challenge is NOT ending up a jack-of-all-trades.Good: There are mechanics called 'karma' and 'mental health'. Going in the red on mental health can cause nasty side-effects such as being unable to attack, attacking constantly or just hallucinating a bunch. Needless to say these happen mid-fight :/ A high karma supposedly helps prevent these lapses.Bad: The karma system makes no sense. Killing small vermin or clones of yourself is bad, completing missions is good. The dialogue trees give the impression of choice but don't seem to matter at all.WTH: At the end of the day, like most features the mental health thing can be cancelled out with an implant or some such.Good: More meaningful than stats are research items you get as drops from enemies. These do anything from stat boosts to unlocking new guns and implants to just making your shinbones unbreakable (yes, you can break both legs and hardly notice).Bad: You never know what a given item does prior to researching and that takes time and money. A lot of research needs several unlocks before appearing.WTH: The research drops are mostly random, and many are ridiculously rare. A player can log 100 hours without getting a certain weapon unlock, for instance. Oh, and there's one or two red herrings with no benefit to them.Good: The player has a lot of tools at their disposal from a cloaking device to spells like cloning themself or making people fight for them.Bad: These all use the same energy bar, which depletes very fast.WTH: Many times these are more flavor than a realistic alternative to simply shooting your enemy. The enemies always know where you are when you uncloak and the clone AI derps around.Good: While the story isn't that long, the player can build their character with random missions to their heart's content.Bad: Everything costs money and story missions pay peanuts. Gaining access to new levels still requires passing them in story mode. There are some grind-only levels, but their mission is usually just to kill everything.WTH: The mission could be to find a briefcase that could be anywhere in the area of several city blocks. Or to keep a group of thick NPCs alive through an ambush (I have yet to succeed in that one).Good: The player can hack doors, turrets and even enemies instead of direct confrontation.Bad: The hacking minigame is incredibly tedious and can take several minutes even at high stat. I was very disappointed I couldn't make a hacked sniper jump to his death.WTH: Hacking doesn't stop or even slow time around you so more often than not you click on icons and listen to annoying sound effects for minutes only to get attacked before you're done.TLDR edition:+looks quite nice+the atmosphere and lore is intriguing at first+a lot of venues to develop your character-plot is a grand illusion-gameplay quickly becomes endless waves of dumb but cheap enemies-random research drops-random death penalty-relies on grinding random missions over and over-the hacking minigame is mind-numbingly boring ",70,31,0,16,3,0,3

You will not get a similar experience from anything else, and you certainly won't find another game like this.

												Are your legs OK?E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy is a low budget FPS/RPG on acid.Take Blade Runner, Warhammer 40K, Deus Ex, Neuromancer and Ridley Scott's Aliens and chuck it all in a blender, add a hearty dose of your favourite recreational psychedelic, and I think you might have the smoothie Streumon were drinking when they made this game.It's beatifully complex. Your character has a web of stats, research, cybernetics, psionic powers and weapons to navigate. You can cloak to go invisible, turn enemies insane, spawn copies of yourself, and even teleport yourself INTO enemies and explode them from within.It's beatifully obtuse. A relevant quote from your own character in the game is: 'There's nothing to understand! Nothing makes any sense.' The story is on a meta-level to end all meta-levels. By the time you've reached the true ending (there's three 'not-true' endings you have to complete before the 'true' ending), you won't know who you are anymore, or what's real, or isn't, or whether you ever really escaped your cycles of guilt.It's beatifully insane. The map design varies from 'Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥is this even source engine?' to 'Eugh, this is definitely source engine.' The characters all seem to be batshit crazy, including yourself, if going by the dialogue is any indication. Speaking of dialogue, it's badly translated, but that just fits right in with the bizarre world anyway. If it's your first time playing you're likely to get lost a lot in the maps. Persevere. Gain Brouzouf. It's worth it.And you can upgrade your cyber-legs to go FAST.			",128,10,0,10,5,0,8

												E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy is unlike anything you will ever play. Despite my relatively short playtime, it's one of the most memorable games I've played in a long, long time.E.Y.E. has fantastic world design, extreme depth in its mechanics, and extremely well done core game mechanics, but it's also user-unfriendly, unpolished, and some of the text appears to be some sort of almost-English language. It has more quality content than most games on the market, even full-priced $60 games, but for nearly every good piece of content in the game, there's some factor that just makes you scratch your head.Both as a shooter and as an RPG, E.Y.E. have a very well-designed core. It allows you to build any kind of character, from a high-tech, heavily augmented super-hacker to a nimble assassin, a cloaked sniper to a heavily-armored living tank, from a berserker wielding explosive katanas to a psychokinetic mage who can telefrag people at will while your clones distract enemies. And each of these builds, and all the builds in-between, can be tuned and tweaked to your liking.There are no class limitations or restrictions, so long as you can plan your stats for what you want to use. These classes are defined by your stats you gain by leveling up, your research you commit to with items you find in the field, and your cybernetic augments that you graft onto yourself as you progress through the game.However, despite the fundamentals of this system being brilliantly done, in practice, there are some builds which are far less practical than others. While being a mind-hacker or psionic mastermind may be very appealing, they are ultimately far less practical than a simple soldier with good guns, or a melee fighter with enough accuracy for an anti-armor handcannon. Fortunately, playing E.Y.E. as purely a shooter, with no bells and whistles attached, is still a great time, but this may disappoint players that were hoping to jump into a first run with one of these builds.More straightforward builds will lead to a better experience for two reasons: difficulty of use, and utter non-information on the complex mechanics of certain builds. The difficulty comes from some builds giving you limited to no ability to directly fight enemies, leaving you with a lack of XP sources to improve yourself further. This is particularly egregious with hacking, as hacking an enemy takes longer, is less effective, and grants lower XP, and gives less money than just shooting the enemy in the first place would. And the greatest shame here is that almost every build in E.Y.E. is an absolute blast to play; it's a ton of fun. Some builds just don't give you the resources you need to reasonably progress like others do.The other problem with certain builds is that they aren't well explained. The first sign of this problem comes in the form of a tutorial system that's better off ignored with how poorly implemented it is. The in-game tutorial shows you how to run, jump, crawl, climb ladders, etc., all things you should already know. But the fine details are left to videos in a menu. The predominant limitation, however, comes from extremely vague descriptions of items and abilities, leaving you to occasionally guess at what things do. When fundamental, build-defining skills can't be identified without being told, there's a serious problem. Fortunately, many of these issues are front-loaded, and after a couple of hours, explanation issues taper down to a tolerable level.Speaking of incomprehensible content, the Research in this game is more of a crapshoot than anything if you don't look up a guide. Without researching it ahead of time, I couldn't tell you what my reward was for researching ""UbiCosif Substance"", or ""Alpha Bio Optical Connex"". According to tech trees, some of the research actually does nothing. ================================So far, this review sounds pretty harsh. I mean, it must seem odd that I'm recommending a game with such glaring issues, right?Well, the pros, in my opinion, outstrip the cons.The world and levels are wonderfully crafted, with obvious attention to detail being put into the atmosphere of the world. The levels are extremely large, allow you to approach objectives in any way you can imagine, and are very non-linear, with each zone feeling more like a mini-sandbox than a mission in a campaign. And it accomplishes this with completely procedural enemy placements, and occasionally with procedural objectives, and it works so well.The atmosphere is spot-on, with the entire world being filled with cybertech and dripping in environmental storytelling. In fact, the environments tell better stories most of the time than the actual story. While the graphics are somewhat dated, the designs are wonderful, and the game stands up in its own gritty, dystopian sort of way.The gunplay is also some of the best the Source engine has to offer, with every weapon giving just the right amount of feedback. The sounds for each one are unique and have fantastic bass and reverb, with the gunfire being just as deadly as the sounds would entail. Additionally, there's variety without excess, and each weapon ends up feeling unique, like there's a role for everything you could take with you.Melee weapons are equally satisfying, and a nimble brawler can be just as entertaining, sidestepping blows and covering space rapidly to slash targets with dual katanas, or chopping up crowds with a sword that makes people explode. Even magic powers feel great to use, with skills that make enemies violently explode into blood fonts, or even the power to clone yourself, all backed up by equally great sound design. Even the aforementioned hacker can be engrossing in its own way, with a few well-placed hacks driving enemy squads into two warring halves while you simply watch from afar. And the hacking is very fun, and an example of a minigame done VERY right, with some strategy and quick thinking required to break enemy defenses.The A.I. is also better than people give it credit for; on higher difficulties, enemies will be aggressive, flush you out with grenades, try to surround you, or even try baiting you into a bad position. It's not excellent, but when you crank the spawn waves to ""Invasion"" level, these small additions can really have an impact on your survival in the long-term.================================While the world is well designed, the plot is really fairly hit-or-miss. Some people love it, some hate it. It's very much a cliche storm, but it's so cheesy that I personally can't help but love it. You're part of a militarized secret society in a civil war fighting a totalitarian government, demonic supermonsters based on humanity's dark sides, and roaming bands of looters. There's at least three MacGuffins and up to five betrayals possible in E.Y.E.'s story, and it's fantastically stupid.On top of that, the localization for this game is hilariously bad. While there is a fan patch that un-Engrishes the game, the stilted, strange speech and swear-storms the characters get into could add to or detract from the experience. For the most part, this doesn't interfere with gameplay, so I won't list this as a negative; it's more up to preference. In my first run, I was only stuck one one objective to ""Realign the Parabola"", and even that was solvable within a few minutes. For those that don't like the transration, fortunately, everyone speaks in a made-up verbal language that works well with the environment, so thankfully, nobody's vocalizing the dreadful text.VerdictWhile E.Y.E.: Divine Cybermancy should, by all means, be a very terrible game, all the things it does well are done exceptionally well. For some, the problems will be deal-breakers. However, if you're looking for a unique game that plays like Deus Ex crossed with F.E.A.R. on cocaine, and you're willing to stomach some extremely rough edges, then this game is absolutely for you.

Posted: April 14
												When I started this game, I was very confused. After one playthrough, I am still confused. I don't understand this game, and I don't think I ever will. Maybe that's why I like it so much. Here is a sample of the questions this game has left me with:-Who am I?-What is Cybermancy, and what is divine about it?-What is E.Y.E., and why did I join it?-What does E.Y.E. stand for?-What is my position within the organization?-What caused my amnesia?-Who is my Mentor, and what is his position in E.Y.E.?-Why is E.Y.E. divided into Culters and Jians?-What is a Culter?-What is a Jian?-Why do I instantly gain Brozoufs when I kill something?-What is a Brozouf?-If Brozoufs are the currency, why can I dump thousands of them into myself to upgrade my cyborg body?-Why are fetch quests only ever half a fetch quest? (seriously, ""bring me this object"" objectives only actually mean pick the thing up and instantly get paid without ever returning it to the person who asked for it)-Why can I jump off a 10 storey cliff and get the notification ""my legs are OK"" but getting shot in the legs for a few seconds means ""my legs are broken""?-Why is there a video tutorial about the video tutorial menu?-Why is the video tutorial menu bound to a hotkey?-Why do none of the video tutorials contain much (if any) coherent or useful information?-How does one ""buy to a seller""?-Why do I sometimes start a mission from the beginning, but sometimes start at a random point? (for some reason I bypassed the entire final level and started it at the final boss. I died and had to redo the level and actually started at the beginning, but it was a strange experience that wasn't unique to that level.)-Why do I have to go to great pains to protect one of my comrades only to see him killed and get the dramatic announcement that the mission is failed and I have to blow up the building to contain the demon threat inside if that very same comrade shows up the VERY NEXT MISSION alive and well (though he gets killed again, of course)?-Why do I have to go through the very same tiny dream world level every time I start the game or die too many times?-What is Klaadum's ladder, and what does ""my note"" on it mean?-What is the karma system, and what does my ranking on it mean?-What is going on with the mental balance system? I don't see a pattern to what does or does not make me insane.-If my superiors keep telling me that I should be stealthy in missions, why are my loadout options 1 silenced weapon and a whole mess of other non-silenced weapons?-Why does one of my swords make people or monsters explode?-Why is my medkit nearly as heavy as a pistol?-If my medkit has unlimited charges to heal me to full health, why doesn't everyone in the universe also have one and use it regularly?-Why do I have personal access to so many scientists to research things for me?-Why are there ancient stone ruins on Mars?-What language are people speaking? The text is English, signs alternate between English, Chinese, and a language that as far as I can tell is just a made up fantasy language to put on carvings, and the spoken language I cannot identify whatsoever.-Why are my dialogue options generally 1. Insult person and agree, 2. Insult person and leave, 3. Insult person and threaten to kill them, thereby initiating combat?-Why are there armouries all over the place for me to fully restock my ammunition and weapons?-Who are the Federation, and why do they hate E.Y.E.?-Why are there encyclopedias worth of lore and backstory information in the hub world that make nearly no sense?-Why is the hub world so gigantic? It takes me 5 minutes to get from one end to another at a dead sprint the entire time.-Why should I care about anything or anyone in this world?Winston Churchill once said of Russia ""It is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma..."" If you substitute ""Russia"" with ""E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy"", you have a pretty good description of this game. Anyone who fully understands this game must have attained enlightenment or something. For anyone else, you will have no idea who you are, where you are going, or why you are doing anything, but you will probably still love it all the same.			",207,30,5,15,17,2,23

												NOTICE: This review is based entirely on singleplayer experience, on one playthrough using one character build. (Hacker with dual pistols and sword)Things that work as expected:► Based on Half-Life 2's Source Engine, so basically everything works properly.► No mouse acceleration or other console-age cancer► Very few bugsThings that exceed expectations:▲ A completely unique and intriguing world with many interesting factions and weird lore▲ A lot of mechanical complexity that still manages to not confuse you▲ So many variations and possibilities due to that complexity, that basically anything you can imagine, you can do if you try hard enough▲ Awesome art style of pretty much everything, nice juxtaposition of dystopian grit and fancy decorative fantasy and pseudo-historical ""thingies""▲ Great atmospheric music that reminds me of Blade Runner▲ You get a sword that makes your targets explode▲ ATMs can hack you to death when you try to steal money▲ Psychological gameplay mechanic that can affect your character's performance and can produce hallucinations that you need to distinguish from real things▲ A large amount of customization in the game options▲ That easter egg with the big hall with the pillars and the multiped tank from Ghost in The ShellThings that fail to meet expectations:▼ Well thought out and complex game mechanics that end up being wasted on a short and fairly ""meh"" story that might or might not make sense▼ Ridiculous enemy respawn rate even on lowest setting. Spawned enemies often automatically home in on the player, which can lead to onslaughts of endless enemy hordes▼ Hacking interface is a bit clumsy. Would have been better with keyboard controls.▼ Half-spent weapon magazines are discarded when reloading. Would be better if you could carry them and reload the magazines at an armory station.▼ Taking hits causes the player character to flinch, making aiming more difficult, but the same rule doesn't apply to the enemies▼ Autosave only▼ On-screen objective markers can sometimes obscure your vision▼ Cybernetic augmentations that let you jump higher but you can still take damage from falling▼ No clear indicator for debuffs such as crippled limbs▼ Binary social interaction choices that are always either an obvious insult or unwarranted praiseTL;DR: A fun action game with deep RPG mechanics, a weird story and world, and a nice art style. It's Deus Ex high on opiates and religion.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is one of my favourites. Despite cranky English texts and bugs (though my friend and I haven't encountered any of them), E.Y.E is awesome. It doesn't spell anything out for you, but once you grasp its mechanics, you're going to love it. It seems that E.Y.E was influenced by Warhammer 40,000, and it has allusions to Philip K.♥♥♥♥♥♥s works and other things, interesting visual design, what-the-feth-is-going-on story that gets progressively more wtf-y as you go through the game, lovely soundtrack, an opportunity to have fun together with your friends, replayability, and you can approach your target any way you want, stealth your way to it, hack your way to it, berserk your way, etc. Oh, and the wonderful possibility of getting hallucinations or being hacked by a door.The only major problem is, not many people know about this game.So, if you want to play something hard and mind-blowing, give E.Y.E a try. It's worth it.			",214,113,1,49,19,2,32

 Mistrust what you believe, ask yourself who you are! Nominating this for Whoa category.E.Y.E will not handhold you, in its plot or in its mechanics. There are difficulty spikes. Its confusing, from beginning to end, in multiple aspects. It will give you powerful weapons and a handful of options on how to defeat enemies whose power is not stupidly smaller than yours- sometimes, its the reverse. All that with occasional vague♥♥♥♥♥♥spouted at you. In other words, this game holds a special place in my heart, not just in the FPS category, but all time. No, I dont mean to mislead anyone- As is the case with other cult classics, its an old, trashy game. There are bugs; the two I've experienced were pretty bad: crashing in between missions, which ended up resetting the mission (but retained gained resources) (which I could solve by changing in-game config), and just up and crashing the whole PC, switching off the monitor and preventing non-hard-reset inputs. Fortunately, the latter seems to be very rare, oe even restritcted to my 7 years old PC. Its also pretty ♥♥♥♥ing awful that there are translation errors, and some of the confusion generated by the plot must be because of that.I dont want to pretend its plot just confusing either. Its badly presented. In the beginning, you know nothing, and then they dump a bunch of info onto you, and tell you to read like seven walls of text on backstory, and if you even bother to read, its still confusing, and then proceed to play the game, and just when you think things are gonna make sense... nope, ♥♥♥♥ you. But its good. Its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good. After reading a bunch of other reviews, I've come to a fairly solid conclusion that E.Y.E is what you make of it, even more so than other games are. I dont mean its like this just in its gameplay, but also in the feeling you get out of being there, in-game; If you're in it for the cyberpunk, you will find the atmosphere to be a sneaky hacker with the classic invisibility cloak, as you walk past by wires and drones and PCs. You can also find in here an appropriate level design to be a vanilla run and gun, righteously wielding Ghost In The Shell's high velocity bullets UZI as you kill lowlife bandits with trashy voice acting. Or, if you're more daring, you will also find there are hints of oriental culture here and there, even an entire jap temple stage, allowing you to literally play in a run-and-sword-and-gun-and-psychexplode style. Even still -and this is something I am impressed by- if, like me, you are paranoid about resources and life, you will find E.Y.E and its giant structures to be very atmospheric, and tense, and sometimes wonder to yourself why didnt anyone tell you this is a horror game in disguise. Divine Cybermancy is not a right, its an earned privilege- Get past the initial tutorials, get past the initial confusion, get past the spikes, and you end up with the (great) elements you'd expect from a weird♥♥♥♥♥game: Mentors, leaders, organizations, otherworldy monsters, insanity, weird symbolism, impactful philosophical cynicism, and triangles.Just... what else do you need?

												You're casually walking down the mean streets of Neo Tokyo when you feel your cyber watch going off in your pocket. You don't even have to activate the hyper sensors on your cyber brain to know who it is before the visual information is delivered to your cyber eyes. It is Mentor and he has been drinking too much at the New Eden underground bar again. You can smell it through the odour sensor implanted into your cyber phone and hooked into your nostrils. He is rambling on about commander Rimanah again and keeps mentioning something about dream sequences. You lower the volume on your  cyber ear implants but can't get right, so you have to stand there frustratedly fiddling with it between 51 and 48 for far too long. You realise that it's gotten very quiet until you hear Mentor clear his throat. He must have asked you a question and is waiting for your response.  Asking him to repeat himself is obviously out of the question, so you begin to panic and try to think of a clever reply to satisfy Mentor. Sweat begins to pour from your forehead, clogging your cyber curcuits and sending them into a frenzy. Smily faces flash rapidly across your cyber optics. You begin to shout uncontrollablyYOU GAIN BROUZOUFSYOU GAIN BROUZOUFSMY LEGS ARE BROKENMY LEGS ARE OKYOU GAIN BROUZOUFSYou see a quick movement in the corner of your vision, but your cyber eyes are malfunctioning too much to focus on anything right now. Someone above you speaks in a tongue you barely recognise and you explode into a fine mist of blood before everything goes black. When you come to it is already night time. You look up and see a beautiful full cyber moon. You are consumed by an uncontrollable urge to slap people upside their heads with your mighty extremities. You rear up onto your hind legs and let out a mighty HOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWLWelcome to E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy			",276,43,9,15,18,2,29

												E.Y.E Divine Cybermancy, I've got a long and mostly boring history with the game, for anyone interested I'll put it in the end of the review.AboutOkay, First of all, the backstory of the game is weird and the game doesn't really do a good job of explaining anything to you, yeah, it sucks, but bear with it, it'll be worth if you paid less than 5 whatever your currency is on the game, if you're looking for a good narrative shooter go to Mass Effect, for this one might be hit or miss for most of the cases.E.Y.E Is about a secret society that's about to go to war, the game speaks of betrayal, conspiracy and search for power, which it does really well.GameplayE.Y.E has one of the best gameplays source engine could offer, there's a lot of variety with the inclusion of psy powers(kind of magic thingamajigs), gun and swords(which can be used simultaneously), robotic implants, and stealth mechanics, it really satisfies everyone's tastes on how to deal with it's open maps, characters have a stats sheet with points on several stats, that might be overwhelming the fist time you see but it's nothing really complicated since you have hover the mouse over and be explained on what the stat influences, on your menu you can see your character, powers, researches, cybertech, missions and actions, those are a lot to explain to people only looking for a review so if you're interested here's a great GuideMusic and sound effectsYou better have a good sci-fi sound track for this one, can't remember one good track on, actually now that I think about it I can't remember even if it has music, one thing's for sure tho, the sound effects of hitting enemies and shooting guns are really satisfyingE.Y.E is really good, if you've got a couple of friends to join in it might even take away from the lack of explanation and how weird it can be at times, there are a good 4 or 5 ending to the game and it provides a fun challenge on harder difficulties, grab a for pack when it's on sale!What it took for me to actually play the game for real:I bought the game march 2015, got it when it was pretty cheap, flash sales or whatever, tried for a few minutes and got confused as ♥♥♥♥ storywise, it throws you in a world where everything is happening and names are being thrown left and right with few explanation, for you to get whats going on you first have to go to the archives on the HUB world and read a ton of codex entries, it's awfully boring so that was a nope at first for me, I uninstalled the game and forgot about it for a year, cue 2016 and I downloaded the game to give it another go, after all the combat is really cool, with swords and guns all over the place, it's really cool how it's easy to kill enemies(for the most part) but it's also really easy to get 3-shoted and die, so yeah, I tried playing again, and it was another NOPE, couldn't bear either not knowing what the ♥♥♥♥ I was doing or reading through the entries, cue 2017 and I was running short on games to play, so I gave it another shot, third time is the charm after all, and so I finally got my♥♥♥♥♥♥together and finish the game, trying my best to deal the random names popping up, and to tell you the truth, not sure if it stops after the beginning of the game or I got used to it.

When friends come together jolly fun was had!Be afraid for bad was also. Endings everywhere but not there if you found it. You should also not hug symbolism. However a chance is there and is inside. There is water in the clothes.Made sense to you? Then E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy is the right game for you.

												This game is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed fever dream of an FPS/RPG. I still have no idea what the story's even about but man do I enjoy blowing people away with a blocky SMG that shoots at sixty-thousand rounds a minute and then sprinting in with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ katana which is the stupidest thing you'd ever do in a firefight but man you're high off whatever the ♥♥♥♥ brouzouf is and you've got psychic powers too I guess so you'll make it work and this is a cyberpunk game anyways so ideally you're also hyped up listening to Lazerhawk or pretending this is Ghost In The Shell or something and there's also neon signs and that's cool and everything's green and orange and buy this game.

												5 Years on and this is still a fun, unique title that belongs in the library of people who are fans of RPGs, Sci-Fi/Fantasy and FPSs.On the subject of genre, you will probably have to be a fan of all three to enjoy this title. The story and a number of the gameplay elements live in the sci-fi/fantasy realm, from optic camoudlage to 'Psi' powers which are pretty much magic. The majority of the gameplay though, sits firmly in the realm of FPS, but with a lot of RPG elements from levelling to upgrades. Story wise, this is a psychological, sci-fi dystopia story, with metaphor and a small amount of 'mind f**king', that may have you questioning the world you find yourself. The story isn't very complicated, but nor is it overtly spelled out for you or particularly well told. I love a good story in a game, even if it's to the detriment of the gameplay. I would not say this is one of those stories that kept me riveted.But now we're onto the best bit, the gameplay. The gameplay is largely excellent. You have a variety of weapons, turrets, and other tools at your disposal that all work in typical FPS style. Instead of being limited to an arbitrary number of weapons or a weight, you're limited by the space in your various pockets and holsters in a system reminiscent of Deus Ex; a minor caveat to this is that carrying a great deal of weight will impact your movement speed. In addition to various tools, you have a variety of skills which vary from hacking to stealth, from X-ray vision to enhanced jumping. You also have access to a second set of skills, your 'Psi' powers, which are essentially magic spells that convert matter into energy, transmute enemies, or deal damage. Both, of these skills require resources that regenerate over time, so depending entirely on them will be tricky.In addition to skills that you can learn, you can also enhance your stats in a classic 'levelling' RPG style, these stats can impact your skills, speed, endurance, and allow you to unlock new weapons and skills. There are actually 3 ways to increase various stats, firstly through gaining experience, secondly through cybernetic upgrades that cost currency, and third through research, which is unlocked through looting or other research, it requires both time and currency to research, but there are other benefits to research.In addition to shooting, and levelling, you have one other major skill to master, hacking. While you can get through most of the game without touching this mini-game, utilizing it is often advantageous such as taking over the 'cyber brain' of your opponent, turning them into a minion, or deactivating turrets from behind cover, or even acquiring extra currency.Though sometimes you will be forced to shoot guns blazing, other times the game gives you so much freedom to play your own way, through cyber-warfare, stealth, sniping, or continuing to shoot everything.The death penalty in this game involves running the risk of acquiring 'scar tissue', which permanently weakens your character, opperating counter to the stats you gain while levelling. Since you're more likely to die on difficulties above your ability, this effectively penalizes the inexperienced yet bold, which may not be the best decision for a video game since sitting in your comfort zone is usually considered less fun. Scar tissue can eventually be removed and prevented through research, a research I consider 'mandatory' as this freedom allows you to experiment, push the boundaries of your skills, try new ways to tackle problems on subsequent playthroughs, and allows you to more freely use Psi powers, the strongest of which have the risk of causing a scar when used.Speaking of subsequent playthroughs, the game features what is essentially a 'new game+' system, allowing you to take your now much stronger character through the game again, perhaps to try a different ending, perhaps boosting the difficulty. Alternatively, you can revisit previously unlocked areas to complete randomized extra objectives, this can allow you to do additional 'levelling' or see newish content. All in all, this stretches out the longevity of the game a little, but with finite content and a relatively small number of areas to explore, don't expect to sink as much time in this game as some others.One minor annoyance is the enemy AI, which almost exclusively resorts to charging toward you and attacking with no real sense of self preservation or tactics. Enemy spawning is near endless at times (dependant on your settings), which can serve to further increase the feeling that enemies are nothing but expendable cannon fodder, reusing the same smallish number of enemy models over and over, which over time gets a little boring.If you get tired of playing solo, this game also features a co-op mode, your experiences will of course vary when going online. 5 Years ago, it was a little tricky to get going, and I have not tried it since. If you do struggle, make sure your router and firewall correctly forward/allow the necessary ports.Graphically, this game still looks better than a lot of small-studio / Indie games that are arriving on steam, despite being over 5 years old. Perhaps some things feel a little too-shiny, but that's a personal preference, not really a complaint.Overall I recommend this game and think it has stood up well to the ravages of time. It is a shame that few games have tried to capture the audience that this game managed to.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There is a sprinkling of redeeming features found in this game. It has a neat cyberpunk atmosphere. You can hack into an enemy soldier's mind and force him to shoot his comrades. You can block bullets with a sword like you're in some cheesy action movie. You can augment features of your cybernetic implants a la Deus Ex to run faster, hit harder, resist damage, et cetera. The rest of the game is a pile of garbage. The game is terribly short, and tries to make up for it by requiring multiple playthroughs. The single player story consists of five or so missions that don't take long to complete. You fight the final boss after a few hours and the game ends. On your first run through, the story is largely incomprehensible and completely nonsensical and only adds to the confusion you feel when the campaign abruptly finishes. The campaign is so short that there's no time to specialize your character, and even having enough money and experience to really explore the roleplaying elements of the game requires running through the game a few times. Sadly, it's very possible to beat the game without upgrading your character at all.You don't need to buy augmentations and abilities for your character to customize him, though: you can choose what kind of armor you want to wear (heavy, medium, or light) and manage a grid-based (again, think Deus Ex) inventory. This kind of freedom would be welcome and greatly improve the game--if there were any point to it. The balance in viability between different styles of play and equipment is terrible: trying to play a stealthy, melee-heavy character is extremely challenging, while wearing heavy armor, lugging around a minigun, and swiss cheesing everything in sight is essentially putting the game on easy mode.There are side missions that you can play to prolong a playthrough, but they kind of suck. There are two kinds: laughably easy and absurdly hard. They're over in minutes either way and there are so few of them that they barely serve to add content. If this game had actual, fleshed-out roleplaying and multiple ways to approach combat and a story mode that couldn't be finished in a single afternoon then I would recommend it. But it doesn't. Hell, there are other glaring, game-breaking flaws I didn't even bother to explain in this review. Avoid this poorly made game.			",75,10,1,1,9,0,8

												(Edited for the purpose of a spelling error)It's essentially a bunch of good and fun ideas mashed together with no pacing or blending. It's not really a bad game, and I'm sure after a while you can get an understanding of how everything works and what you should do, but after almost 4 hours I still had no understanding of my character's complicated abilities.If you like complex cooperative shooters with a semi-open world touch, give it a try. It definitely wasn't for me but with enough interest in time I'm sure you could learn to love it.			",114,7,0,12,10,0,6

												I can't remember when I got EYE or how much I've paid for it, but it's been as cheap as 99 cents before and it was at one time given out as a gag gift for Christmas, like Secret of the Magic Crystals or Bad Rats.  Don't let that speak of its quality, though.  I also didn't record how long one go-through was, but I've also gone through this game around three times before writing this review, and I of course lost that save.  I played EYE entirely with keyboard and mouse.  I've heard EYE be described as Deus Ex set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe (not officially of course), and though I don't know much about the latter series, it does kinda play a bit like the first Deus Ex.  There's a grid inventory, your crosshairs shrink when you stand still, augmentations, skills affecting performance like an RPG even though it's an FPS--that sorta thing.  You're one of the elite Culter Dei, one of the sects of EYE, which is itself a branch of the Secreta.  And you've just woken in a cave with severe wounds and amnesia.  Things are pretty bad elsewhere, too.  Looters are everywhere, the Federation is investigating your employers, you're in a secret civil war with another sect of EYE, and there's this Metastreumonic Force that's creating monsters out of our darkest fears and desires.  Plenty of targets...right?EYE starts with you rolling stats.  Pick three genes and hit Reroll until they look good to you.  High Strength lets you hit harder with melee weapons, high Endurance lets you take more damage, high Hacking makes the hacking minigame easier, etc.  What I thought was kinda nice is that there are two ways to manage your stats:  The first is to manually assign your three stat points you receive on level-up.  You can play any way you like and you have fine control over how your character develops.  The second way is to let the game automatically assign your points based on how you play.  If you shoot enemies a lot, you gain points in Accuracy; if you get shot a lot, Endurance, and so on.  Most people would go for the first but it's kinda interesting to see how you develop with the second method, which I did this time around.  While there is a pretty big variety of weapons and augmentations and powers available by default, there are many that require specific stats on top of the need for research and money too.    As for weapons, you have melee weapons, handguns, assault rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, heavy weapons, and a couple of other categories.  Though there is a grid inventory, it is broken up into regions unlike Deus Ex's single big block.  What this means is that you are usually limited on the guns you can carry since several of them are only big enough to fit in your big 3x5 slot on your back.  Not to say you can only take one gun with you--handguns and the basic submachine gun can fit in your lower leg slots, but you'll likely be filling your arm/shoulder/upper leg slots with ammo.  And this game did something I've rarely seen in other FPSes though it does come up--if you reload, you lose all of the ammo in your current mag no matter how full it was.  You need to strike a good balance between literally wasting ammo and having enough loaded to take out your enemies without being forced to reload under fire.  There's also a weight system where your choice of light/medium/heavy armor and all of your current gear slows you down, but I was pretty much at the 95% encumbered limit anyway.  Several weapons have a firing mode toggle, like the HS010 submachine gun drastically boosting its fire rate at the cost of accuracy.  I didn't really do much with the magic/powers, the enhancements, or even the augmentations.  There doesn't seem to be something like a basic fireball, but you can instead teleport into your enemy and telefrag him.  Or with one of the end-of-route powers, cause your enemy to get hurt when you do and you heal when you hurt him.  There weren't too many but you start with being able to make several weak clones of yourself that can attack the enemy and being able to convert dropped weapons and ammo into health.  Augmentations are things like invisibility, making your shots 100% accurate, being able to see in the dark, and so on.  Both powers and augmentations (and sprinting and superjumps) used your slowly-regenerating stamina bar, which refills faster by crouching.  I very often found myself running low but that was due to my build and the lack of upgrades.  Finally, enhancements are largely stat buffs, things like ""run faster and jump higher with Cyber Legs"" or ""take less headshot damage with this upgrade"" and so on.  There are many Research projects to find.  Kill an enemy and they might drop a silver briefcase which contains a random project which you can then pay scientists to research for you, with an inversely-proportional slider for the speed of research versus the cost.  Thankfully it doesn't take real-time days and hours to resolve.  Once finished, you're given a notification and that research is permanently unlocked and you are able to move to the next thing to research.  There's still a bit of a random element since you cannot unlock the entire research tree without these drops.  But researching is always worth it, and I'd very strongly suggest researching the Medkit ASAP because it is the only other way to heal other than one of your starting spells.  You'll be using it a lot, believe me.  This game does have three different routes, though the split is pretty far in the game.  There are some different ways to approach mission objectives, but not to the extent of Deus Ex (the 'number of ways to solve a locked door' image doesn't apply here).  Several maps have optional sidequests though it's hard to tell what is and isn't required to advance the main mission since they all use the same marker/icon.  What's neat is being able to load a Temple HQ game and be able to visit any map you've cleared previously.  You're given a set of objectives, but you're largely there to farm enemies for EXP and money.  The maps themselves are pretty big and there are no loading screens except when you load them initially, like with other Source engine games.  The wait times on an SSD are pretty minor.  Music is pretty ambient and voiced dialog is apparently not in any actual language, but it's there.  I had a bit of slowdown in graphics but I don't know how well the ""Source game so you can run it on a toaster"" applies here because the game can throw quite a lot of mooks at you in these huge levels--and there are even options to make it do just that.  Scenery isn't even what I'd call pretty because it ascribes to the ""real is brown/grey"" idea, but maybe that's the point.  Part of the backstory is that the Metastreumonic Force apparently cropped up because of aggressive ecological destruction and expansionism by human hands, so places looking dull helps with that.  A few areas were incredibly dark and I had to crank up the gamma just to see.  As for low points, the story is there but it's pretty hard to wrap your head around.  I used to say that the story was incomprehensible, but it's just...weird.  Some of the dialog comes off as poorly-translated, but I don't know if the translation was improved in EYE's big update a couple of years ago.  You're probably not going to play for the story, though there's a pretty interesting one to dig up.  And I didn't really like the hacking minigame, though you're thankfully not pitted against hardy targets the few times the game forces you to do it.  Granted, I had bad stats for hacking too.  I enjoyed it, though it's pretty rough around the edges and the difficulty is all over the place.  Even if it plays a lot like Deus Ex, it still does its own thing pretty well and there are zero non-fatal options here, though there's always the potential for stealth or different playstyles or builds, so there's probably something for anyone who likes RPGs mixed with FPSes here.

												Alright, I have nothing better to do so I'll go ahead and write an in-depth review about E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy.First ImpressionsE.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy doesn't waste any time getting you into the game. After a mystifying dream sequence, you begin in a limestone cave partially submerged in water, a red flare in the distance. Immediately, you recieve a transmission from someone or another, telling you to exfiltrate.It is pretty obvious that a battle has occured within the cave system, however, your character is as clueless as you are. Immediately, you start asking questions. What was that genestealer-like creature that just attacked me? Who are these faceless ""federals"" and why am I fighting them? Why do all the thugs have goggles for eyes and cheap grenadier helmets from the 1800s?Honestly, not much is explained. The intro mission was oblique but confusing, and the exposition in the temple afterwards doesn't explain much either.VisualsI wouldn't really say anything positive or negative regarding the visuals. It was made in source; some areas are beautiful and finely detailed, other areas are wide open canvases with very little to satisfy one's gaze. Some areas, such as the temple, were vast but impractical, with enourmous brown spires that were massive but created too much empty space in the enviroments detail-wise.The weapon models are exceptional, however, it is obvious most viewmodels/weapons were designed before the general motif of the game was accomplished. Whereas all characters wear contemporary ""knight"" armor, the player's  hands look like a ninja's from a Japanese cyberpunk anime.Enemies were mostly conglomerates of other creatures in fiction. It is clear that the bandits are modeled off of classical cyberpunks, E.Y.E. agents from WH40k, struems from Aliens and WH40k as well.StoryVirtually nonexistent, hidden between sentimental cliches of science fiction and war. It was hard to tell if there was a deeper message shoehorned into the generic, easy-to-catch story of ""this man did so-and-so, kill him"" or ""we need to insert on Mars, help us with the assault"".The dialogue mechanics were likely the sloppiest parts of the game. All characters read (no voice acting, save for the alien gibberish) like brosephs from gym, and did very little if not detract from the mood of the game. Emotional attachment to any character at all was rare (I felt this way for Mentor, since he was just such a nice guy). I won't say much about the ending, however, I disliked it.GameplayAs a shooter, E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy is pretty solid. The weapon handling was decent, inventory system was simple but satisfying, and the open-choice system when it came to tactics was pretty solid. However, combat suffered from the Source issue of AI; all enemy AI is programmed to always know your location once they see you, and will follow the closest node to reach and engage you. Of course, this rendered conventional stealth tactics useless.The grinding required to apprehend efficient gear is despicable and not enjoyable at all. Every mission followed a similar formula, in which you try to reach the objectives as fast as possible in the midst of the infinitely-respawning enemies.Overall OpinionE.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy was enjoyable enough when it came to the sense of adventure it gave you going through each level, however, it isn't something I'd neccessarily play through again.As far as reccomendations go, I do not reccomend this game; not out of spite, but because it's simply not for everyone. If you are able to get if for a discount like I did, it definitely is a steal.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The weakest thing about this game is its English.The gunplay is stellar, the character creation and levelling are amazing. Everything feels so good and the feeling of progression is unbelievably strong.People often say the plot is mysterious or difficult to grasp, but that's only true at a glance. Read everything. Talk to everyone. The plot becomes surprisingly straightforward, and one of the smartest games I've ever played.In conclusion, I've gained brouzouf, my legs are OK, and this game is a masterpiece.

												Excellent if you have the patience for broken English and cumbersome mechanics. E.Y.E. is a dystopian fantasy rpg/fps set around a board game created by the publisher, the game's story is a little convoluted and almost demands that players complete the game multiple times to get it all; there are three separate endings and fourth hidden one. Ripe with science fiction and cyber punk lore E.Y.E.'s campaign can be played single player or cooperatively. Philip K. Dic k would approve.			",355,37,4,32,109,1,42

												E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy is a weird, crazy, broken mess of a game that awkwardly mixes an incredibly strange world, heavy RPG mechanics and FPS combat. And I utterly love it.This game isn't for everyone - its tutorials are so terrible I didn't know half of what I could do until 20 hours of play - but if you can persevere through its flaws you will find an incredibly engaging and unique experience. The gunplay is exceptionally rewarding, the stat systems have powerful effects on how you play, the Psi Powers are all fun to play with, implants like the Cloak add new depths of stategy to combat and movement, and no feeling beats the first time you hack one of those blasted Interceptors to turn on your foes.For any new players I have two essential words of advice: Get a Medkit ASAP, and the Power Conversion implant soon after. The two together will save you innumerable minutes of waiting crouched in a corner for your stamina to refill.Finally, this game is even more fun with friends. Battle Royale is like a souped up callback to old days of competing in DOOM, though it locks away special abilities in the interest of balance, and co-operative missions can be insanely satisfying as you blow away hordes of enemies. To me this game is like the incredible pie your grandmother baked for a picnic that someone kicked over in the car - it's crushed and broken, the pastry strewn everywhere, but if you get past its appearance and give it a taste you'll find it's more delicious than you ever hoped. I love this game, and when the open worlds and grand vistas of newer games get stale E.Y.E is where I return for a few fun hours of hacking doors and smashing heads.8/10. Brilliant game, lacking presentation.			",170,26,0,23,9,1,13

												I don't even know where to begin with this game. If feels like a mod for HL2. I'm not just saying that because of the loading screens, and the borrowed sounds. It's rough around the edges. The textures look fine, the models are okay, but the sound is rubbish, npcs speak in gutteral nonsense, enemies spawn randomly, animation is a stiff, the plot is advanced by onscreen text, and the game plays through as levels. This game feels sterile and hollow. I feel like I should be playing this game a decade ago.I wouldn't reccomend getting this one.			",381,117,3,68,29,4,47

												Game turned me off at first with its unintuitive UI, mechanics, and strange setting, but once I got used to all that the game became immensely satisfying. Gunplay is actaully really solid and the story while weird is intriguing when you figure it out. Loved the deep RPG mechanics and the multiple paths you could take throughout the campaign and the game highly encourages replayability and trying things out differently which is great. Very fun to be a badass cyborg/knight/psychic/ninja.Liked this game a whole lot. Highly recommend it to anybody that loves FPS/RPGs that gives you lots of freedom to play however you want. It's like a surreal French Deus Ex mixed with Warhammer 40k mixed with Jacob's Ladder (the movie).This game also gets huge bonus points for having the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ CYBERDEMON FROM DOOM as an enemy type!

												This is a great game but I only recommend it if you don't mind reading in depth, complicated storylines with zero context from our known world. In other words, you'll probably be lost with the story for a while but you'll get a lot more enjoyment from it if you understand what is going on.Pros:originalitygritty feelcool cybernetics and psych abilitiesdecent story line with alternate endingsimmersionCons:-written by people whose first language is not English, so there are grammatical mistakes and unnatural phrasing (this wasn't a big issue for me and I didn't feel like it pulled me out of the story while I was trying to figure out what they were saying but I see that a lot of people complain about it)-confusing, almost disappointing, ending at first (but finish the game and then google alternate endings)-something like 24 tutorial videos that put me off from playing for a while-the A.I. is very 'meh' and it shows its ageI wish there was a button between recommending this game and not recommending it. I would not recommend this game to most people because I don't think they would have an appreciation for it and it definitely has its flaws. However, I bought this game because it gave me a certain feeling when I watched the gameplay videos and I was not disappointed.			",67,12,0,14,4,0,23

												Excellent game, if you're a fan of Deus Ex: Human Revolution, this game is right up your alley. Although, don't expect in-depth RPG decisions, or a ""Pacifist"" way of playing the game.That said, all the weapons handle pretty good, they are satisfactory to use, the segmented grid-like inventory system allows for diverse loadouts without becoming extremely overpowered, few maps, but big and plenty to do in each of them, and up to 32 player co-op.Graphics are what you'd expect from the Source Engine, nothing too impresive but looks great in some areas.Dying, however, has almost no consequences. You don't lose Brouzouf (money), or experience, or anything really, just a few seconds while you respawn exactly where you died, the enemies don't even heal. You can respawn up to 9 times (upgradable), and after that, you only get a smack on the wrist by an NPC, telling you something along the lines of ""You should really stop dying so much"", and then you appear at the start of the map where you died with the exact same objective you were doing before you died, and you get your 9 respawns back. It's essentially what would happen if you quit the game mid-mission. There is a mechanic where you can get ""permanently injured"" if you die too much, but as far as I'm concerned, that happens so little, it's not worth taking into account.This game is honestly a hidden gem, and will not dissapoint.

												If you liked Deus Ex Human revalation, and if you like your legs being ok. I present, Deus Ex, The more guns edition. In a world you can die from failing to hack a door open, shoot a clone of yourself in the face. Not understand what the voice actores are saying. Then later laughing as you hacked one of your foes and let them shoot their friends in the face as you sit back and watch. Also did you know there is super jump, no fall damage and invisibility? Also at level one you get a mini gun that costs you nothing regarding in game money and you can spam to your heart's content.  If you like moving at the speed of a turtle.			",212,21,1,44,47,2,61

												It's a weird game. In my opinion the greatest flaw is the AI, they will spot you no matter the distance. For instance, there is this windy, foggy level with dust storms and you're on a 200m high cliff and you peek a tiny bit over it... the soldiers below immediately shoot at your head... WTF, I can't even see them and I'm supposed to be a genetically modified super future super warrior.A lot of mechanics and upgrades come unexplained and dialogue is really bad, the NPCs will immediately turn hostile for things like ""Hmm...Ok!"".It also has cool weapons and okay gunfight, but a nonexistent incoherent story, at times boring and wide level design. It's almost completely shooting based, but people call it an RPG...it has other not as useful mechanics.Also with it being a source game it runs pretty good but some of the mechanics create unbeliavable lag, like ""infrared"" vision, which makes it useless on my machine.And the ending:It was all you, it was all a dream, it just restarts the game ",113,21,3,7,17,0,18

												E.Y.E. Divine Cybermancy is a weird♥♥♥♥♥game. It's an example of a bunch of interesting ideas stapled to a game that doesn't fully take advantage of most of them, and has a ridiculously open approach to character development.If you can appreciate games that aren't the most polished things on the planet, this might be for you.

												This is one of those cases where you will either hate it, or love it. Or, more likely, hate it, then love it.This game is an embodiment of confusion. While the mechanics themselves are not that complex and opaque, the way they are presented makes understanding them quite a hard task. But once you get a hang of them, you suddenly begin to have loads of fun.The gunplay is solid, and every weapon feels actually useful, although some are clearly outclassed by others (I'm looking at you, Rotten Mound). Apart from Betty Boom, shotguns here avert the classic disease of extreme spread and low range. Assault rifles all have a semi-auto mode, which immensely helps at long range. Then there is a pistol that can shoot through walls and disregard any armor you target might be clad in, an automatic sticky proximity grenade launcher, minigun (which is REALLY awesome), thermonuclear cannon with 10m blast radius and an ancient warhammer capable of killing almost any enemy in the game in one hit.Art direction is kinda all over the place stylistically, with classic cyberpunk tropes like implants, megacorps, oppressive government and violent anarchists in the slums coexisting with 40K-esque high fantasy stuff like psionics, the eponymous E.Y.E, metastreumonic force, ancient civilizations and necromancy. But in the end it feels vary wholesome and high in quality.The story is something you have to experience on your own. It's very confusing until almost the very end, where you get the general idea of what's going on.Cybernetic implants and psionics are VERY cool and VERY fun to use. Upgrade you cyberlegs and you'll be able to outrun a cheetah and jump a dozen meters high. Get the Dragon's Breath psi power and you'll be able to literally telefrag your enemies. Makes for a handy quick way to move across the levels, too.Speaking of levels, they are vast and sprawling, full of little nooks and corners with extreme amount of detail everywhere. Although their size can make them somewhat tedious to traverse early on.Difficulty is completely customizable with half a dozen of default presets and a plenty of options which can be fine-tuned individually to suit your preferences the best.

												Kind of like a bootleg, broken english Deus Ex, sprinkled with akira references and occult jargon. Arguably more RPG than FPS. Good map design, easy to get lost. The story is borderline incomprehensible in the first few hours, and things get even weirder as you progress.I honestly have no idea what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on, but I like it.			",57,12,0,13,2,0,0

												This game can be considered a RPG with a heavy-lean towards the RP part of it. The gameworld is very flourished with creativity and surroundings to a cyber-punk world. The feel i missed from Deus ex:HR for example. It's rpg elements come from character customization from skills, items and weapons. The game is great, even if some shun it for it's simplicity, but then again as many have said, ""It is a game to love or hate."" For me, the first.			",198,17,0,29,11,3,15

												The game MAY be good. I'm not sure. It's so obtuse that it's hard to be certain of anything. The interface is poorly laid out, the tutorials are an awful jumble, the controls are a mess, menus upon menus with invented gibberish words marking the path... They need a Director's Cut version of the game that makes the brick wall you ned to smash through to enjoy it just a little smaller. As of right now, it could be the greatest game in the world, but most people playing will never know.			",1617,639,68,228,151,17,265

												This game is pretty hard.

And the npcs will just come, in unlimited numbers and in endless waves. Some researches will give you back the lost stats tho.

												The best way to describe this game is to. ""Give a french development team a copy of source. Tell them to develop deus ex meets system shock 2. And then give them a bunch of crack and red bull.""It is a role playing shooter that feels like a shooter more than an rpg. I could equate it to being a more action packed version of the original deus ex or system shock 2... prob closer to system shock 2 in terms of system, but its quite interesting.Its cyberpunk to the core. The story is about corporations hiring and cloning their own security force, which they cybernetically augment. There are multiple endings, each gives you a different psionic spell to cast. Get all 3 and you get a 4th super powerful one that will obliterate any enemy you come across.You gain states, you research and use cybernetic augments like stealth, the ability to see through walls, jump higher, etc. If you die there are sometimes permanent stat losses that can only be negated through researching a lot of items.Its very hard to peg down why this so enjoyable, as its fairly insane in every aspect... But I have quite enjoyed it. Plus they have a sword that implodes enemies.			",285,19,5,41,11,0,42

												This is the best bad game I'd ever play! This abomination, is well worth your time and the money it costs to buy. Basically, you're an amnesiac killer power-armored psychic bioenhanced cyborg member of a secret fraternity of warrior-monks which is fighting the legitimate government. Truth be told, I barely understand it, but that's not the reason I like it.It includes rpg elements and character upgrades, including cybernetic upgrades, leveling up, buying superpowers...Many ways to play; if you want to play the game as a stealthy hacker ninja, you can. If you want to put on heavy armor, grab the (stupidly overpowered) minigun, and pretend you're the Terminator and walk through a dozen rockets and about a thousand bullets, you can too. If you want to summon hordes of clones and unleash them on your foes, you can do that too. Did I mention you can hack enemies into this game and possess or MIND CONTROL them? Well... you can.If you get bored of guns, you can use melee weapons. And this isn't just a joke, the melee weapons in this game are death machines. You have swords that cause people to literally explode. And you can parry bullets with them like a jedi!Also, the game's designers and writers are all French, so there is that amazingly hilarious bad translation. Nothing in this game makes sense, but it's a good kind of insane.And, of course, it has that superb full coop gameplay, really fun.			",168,121,3,54,48,1,39

												""Hey, I just finished E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy!"" Did I?Everyone who did a playthrough will know what I'm talking about. So, my second time is still to come but I completed one complete possible storyline or how you might call it.So what is this game like? [Note: You can still read my very first impression at the very bottom.]One word that describes it - many might agree: ""Strange."" Well, that doesn't say much though it really is the case with this game. It has an overwhelming feel to it - this is the case for the writing, the style and the gameplay. Though you don't necessarily have to sink into this universe and can just scrap the surface (gameplaywise and storywise) I recommend to take your time with this game. It pays off. Much has been said so I will just list some things I find worth mentioning to give you an impression:- Art/Style: Set in a Sci-Fi-dystopian world with an asian touch - it feels like a...well...futuristic, steampunk chinatown universe at times.- Music: What shall I say, this creates atmosphere at it's best.- Gameplay: Confusing right from the beginning as it's a blend of FPS with deep RPG-similar mechanics. Your possibilities range from Research, to classic leveling up to some sort of skill tree etc. At the very beginning you can pre-customize your character in the way intended. It may be decisive if you want to choose a certain approach like stealth, hacking, combat etc.The maps are huge and you get lost pretty easily - one might criticize that. Also the level design isn't the best at times. The campaign is loosely structured with somewhat missions - each has its specific main goals and possible side-goals you may want to achieve or not, you can progress though without caring. From time to time the interaction with the NPCs will let you or force you to make decisions that affect your playthrough experience.- Other feature worth mentioning: This game is ""circular"" in it's very best sense - multiple playthroughs intended, there is no real ending as there is no real end (storywise, gamewise). Replayability: 100%________________________________________________This is a very very first impression comment on the game and I just want to share one thing with you guys because it's something remarkable for me as a gamer:It was the first time after a long period of FPS-gaming time that holding a gun in my hands evoked some kind of feeling. It just felt fresh and astonishing and I can't explain why. Well, there is something more to it.There has been a lot of talk about shooters and immersion and experience.Immersion - there you go.(I will elaborate on this after I progress in the game. For now - there has already been talked about the cyber-steampunk setting with the asian touch a lot as well as the soundtrack and so on. Go have a read if you like.)			",533,153,9,67,39,3,54

												Reviewing a game like E.Y.E comprehensively isn't an easy task, none the less lets have a stab at it.The game makes a thematic spin on a common premise:- You are a super soldier with Amnesia- There is a war going on- You are going to kill your way to victory in FPS gloryThis is where is leaves the standard model behind both in gameplay, aesthetic, theme and story.From a Gameplay perspective all skills and utilities are provided as a means of killing things. Even the medkit can be used to overdose someone.Hacking? use it to fry someone's brain or turn them crazy and make them attack their colleagues.Magic? Create a clone army of yourself and send them in to battle, or if you prefer the direct approach just teleport yourself ""inside"" your target enemy and make them explode.Stealth? Cloak up, jump over buildings, snipe people or slit their throats (or crush them with a hammer... or crush them by falling on them super-mario style)Guns? Guns.And on the topic of guns, this game really brings home the bacon with satisfying weaponry. Admittedly there are no super fancy guns that shoot lightning and razorblades and fire and particle effects and♥♥♥♥♥♥ but there are guns that will consume their entire magazine in a single trigger press because ""Why only shoot one bullet when  you can shoot all the bullets?""There are handcannons that can destroy attack choppers, machine pistols that will decimate entire squads of terrorists and melee weapons that can be used to not only deflect bullets but cleave entire swaths of would be enemies in two.Even the entry level pistols are very satisfying to use as you put round after round into the ribcages and craniums of your aggressors.Theme? Dystopian cyberpunk inspired by somewhere between the matrix (it's shame that movie never had a sequel), bladerunner, johnny mnemonic and pretty much every major sci-fi movie from the 80's onwards, it's a real melting pot of♥♥♥♥♥♥and at times you will even notice design influences and likenesses to cult sci-fi shows like Farscape and videogames like shadowrun (the Genesis version, i never played the xbox/PC version).It is very atmospheric, and very well fitting. If you can ignore some of the now dated and chunky environments, but hey, the source engine can only be pushed so far.Now, story... Story is very difficult to explain in a simple review, but just be aware of the following: if you WANT a story, it is there, a full narrative of what's going on and who you are, but it is not going to hold  your hand. This isn't CoD where it's straightforward ""good against evil"", this isn't Deus Ex with it's over-arching evil corporations and terrorists (although there are plenty of both in E.Y.E), and this isn't <insert generic RPG> where the protagonist undergoes Tom Cruise syndrome (He's a good <x> but he has his doubts, UNTIL FEMALE <y> CAUSES HIM TO HAVE A CRISIS OF FAITH, AND IN ORDER TO WIN HER LOVE HE BECOMES A GREAT <x>. no really, that's every tom cruise movie ever.) before eventually facing off with the nemesis antagonist.tl;dr? wacky off-form shooter with RPG elements and a batshit crazy plot with cyberpunk aesthetics.

												E.Y.E....where to even begin?This game is an amalgamation of different genres. FPS, strategy, RPG, other ones that escape my mind at the moment. And it doesn't put them together well. It's unpolished as hell and it will most likely, no it WILL confuse you within the first 5 minutes of playtime.To me, that lack of polish and confusing game mechanics adds to its charm. Of course, for the first 10 hours, it really frustrated me. Starting your first game in E.Y.E is like sprinting full speed into a running saw blade. There's a huge learning curve. No one goes into this game an expert, but people who stay in the game long enough usually become one. It's not like most modern FPS games where you already know exactly what to do. Maybe there's like, 5 new things added in, but for the most part, it's the same formula. And it's like that because the developers already know that they can profit off of it.This game takes a completely different approach and it does it WELL. It gives no regard to what you, the player, are used to, or want in a game. No, this game exists because it WANTS to exist.There is no pandering to playerbases or boring, seen-it-all-before gameplay. Nuh-uh, this is something special.When you discover a game this..exotic, it makes you feel like you just found a gem. And while it most definitely isn't very refined, it doesn't honestly matter in the end if you keep with it. You come to appreciate its differences and love it for them.TL;DRjust buy the game already			",66,8,1,10,12,0,3

												Sooooooo..... let me tell it to ya straight...E.Y.E. is weird... It's really frickin' weird...You are futuristic space monk hacker badass, who's part of a rebellion against an Evil Federation(?) who rules the galaxy with an iron fist, all whilst kinda fighting/kinda not fighting amongst your allies, The Jian, who also hate you in return yet you guys both hate the federation, but are very willing to stab each other in the back on your merry way to freedom. Not to mention the space demons that show up at random times and ruin your day.And you also have a wife. Like seriously... WHAT!?All sillyness aside, E.Y.E.'s Plot is, while very good in some respects, very convoluted. There is soooome character development, but because of all of it's wackiness, I Didn't really feel very attached with most of the characters or even why I should care about them. Like, it literally takes THREE playthroughs before you finally figure out what's going on, not to mention the game doesn't explain itself very well. Especially when it comes to actually 𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑔 the game.""Why Ciro, what do you mean by that? Doesn't the game give you a tutorial at the beginning of the game, like everygame should?"" I hear you casual gamers out there say. And yes, it does and it does it decently. But only when it comes to the basics of the game. That's it. Okay, I kinda lied. It dooooes tell you how to hack and use some of your powers, but where this game really shines is it's damn near endless possibilities of approaching combat, (Which I'll get into later), And it doesn't tell you squat on how to use that or even understand it. And when you have a specific playstyle you want to use, but can't figure it out....Welp... Let's just say the game doesn't care and you have to result in being RunGunShootMan. And grinding.....Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuugh......Now I normally enjoy grinding, I find it very therapeutic at times. But Grinding in E.Y.E. can be a pain in the groin at times, especially since everything costs money and though getting money is easy,( Just kill everything!^^), Everything is expensive. And when I have to pay a lot of money to get further in my game.... Welp.... It's just not fun. Like space demons. Lemme tell you what, while the enemies are generally a joy most of the time because of their well designed AI and tendency to tactics and team work that always keep you on your toes,(which I like... Alot!), The Metastreumonic are different. They bum rush you with as many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ creatures that they have on standby and just.. keep.. on... coming!! NO PUN/INUENDO INTENDED!!!They're annoying, They're difficult in large numbers,(which they will always be in large numbers. accept that now my little newbies.), and they are just uneccesary in this game.So after all of this, you would be thinking that I wouldn't recommend this game right?Well you would be wrong. Dead wrong.While I don't play this game as much as I do other games, this is still one of the best games I have ever played in my entire life. I started out with all the negatives, not because I hate this game, but because I wanted to let you, dear noobs, know what you were getting into. While E.Y.E. has some very strong downsides, It's positives more than make up for that.For instances, Character building.Oh my GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWD the character building in this game is nigh perfect! Hell, at the very beginning of the game, you get to choose what genes you have in your brian, (WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT BTW!!), for it affects what your character can do in the game. And as I stated before up above, the possibilities of combat are damn near endless. there's almost nothing you can't do in this game! you want to run and gun your enemies with Matrix like finesse, Go for it! you want to tank up and mow your foes like a bloody lawnmower, Do it! If you want to hack your enemies into joining your side or even control their body movements have at it! You want call upon the very fabric of space and time and use your mystical psychic powers to summon forth clones of yourself while you make your strongest foes explode and turn into a horrific lovecraftian beast that drives your enemies insane as you and your clones cleave and gun down fleeing foes... IF THAT'S YOUR FETISH!! And those four things are just the tip of the ice burg!With LOTS of patience effort, you can do all kinds of things that you could only dream of and become a freakin' battle god/goddess! And speaking of battle, combat in this game is on point! Pending on how high your accuracy is, (if you're like me you don't have to worry about that! >:3), you can pretty much nail enemies with pinpoint accuracy and slaying foes is always satisfying! weapon's are usually a joy to use and there are many of them to choose from!And don't even get me started on the cybernetic enhancements and implants! though pricey and require some grinding to use, I find Cybernetics in this game to be handled very well and it always makes me feel like a total badass when I use them! I mean, Cybervision to see enemies in the dark or to make them more visible, Sound triangulation to found out where moving/talking enemies are on the map, even a freaking cloaking device that renders you almost completely invisible! It feels like I'm from Ghost in the Shell!With that being said, E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy at first may seem like a very intimidating game and very broken to it's core. But once you see past those flaws, You'll find that this game has many redeemable qualities and is very close to being a perfect cyberpunk game that, if you're still interested in, deserves a total recommendation.Give it a shot! ^^𝘓𝘓𝘓𝘓𝘓𝘈𝘛𝘈𝘈𝘈𝘈𝘈𝘈𝘈𝘈𝘈𝘈𝘈𝘈𝘈𝘈𝘈𝘈𝘈𝘈𝘈𝘈𝘈𝘈𝘏𝘚!!!

												If Cyberpunk is currently your thing and Half-Life's Source Engine has always been your thing: then I think you are probably going to find E.Y.E. Divine Cybermancy to be a very interesting game. If a Cyberpunk, FPS/RPG, with some of the most ♥♥♥♥ed up achievements aren't enough to entice you to play this game, then I don't know what will.My friend is a really big Cyberpunk fanatic and one day, he started showing me his progress in the game and I have to be honest - the Source Engine was noticable (almost straight away), but I feel like that isn't a bad thing, since it adds unique features, such as: a few RPG Elements (Levelling-Up, Research/Skills and Stats, Purchasing Item...), Psi Force (A variety of mental/phsycic powers: sort of acts as the games Magic system), Not only is it a Dark Cyberpunk world, but you can get really cool Augmentations/Upgrades for your character! (Enhance your Vital Organs, Limbs, Nerves, Skeleton, Natural Resistence and much, much more). The GENERAL combat system is what you'd expect from a Source Engine-based game, however; the extra features, selection of weapons, qwerky stat system, Psi Force abilities and the option to enhance your body with augmentions, just makes the combat a lot more vercetile, than any FPS or RPG that I have ever played.Oh yeah, EXPLODING MELEE WEAPONS - 93/100!

												The game is a horrible mess of a weird♥♥♥♥♥plot, odd translations, weird mechanics, lack of any real direction initially, and a horrible unuser friendly way of getting any multiplayer games going.The game is a joyous empowering romp through hundreds of enemies warhammer style, with tight first person shooter/hack n slash gameplay, with gorgeous cyberpunk graphics, and a philosophical tale that will make even the most studied scholar scratch his head, and rpg elements that feeling meaningful and non hindering to the gameplay.Expect to be lost, confused, amazed, frustrated, unstoppable and hopeless. When you finnaly understand what the game is you will become addicted to the lore and gameplay in such a way you may never feel like you will understand it all but at the same time feel like you uncovered some weird secret to life.Buy it if you are open minded, not expecting fallout/deus ex, and don't need closure.

												EYE: Divine Cybermancy is one of the most f*cking out-there games I've ever played. No, scratch that; it's the most out-there game I've ever played, by far. I remember reading somewhere that one or more of the developers of this game at Streumon Studios suffers from schizophrenia, which would make sense, because if I had to choose one single word to describe this game, it would be ""schizophrenic"".An absolutely gut-bustingly hilariously bad translation from French makes the balls-to-the-wall crazy plot of Jians vs Culters vs Feds vs bandits vs hyperdimensional aliens (?? maybe? I think????? I've played this game several times but I'm still not 100% sure), set in the darkest, grittiest Sino-Japonic-influenced cyberpunk setting I've ever experienced (seriously, the atmosphere rivals Snow Crash) and an insane variety of gameplay mechanics that all mesh together in an extraordinarily well-balanced and thought-out way, extensive replayability despite only a dozen or so maps, a choose-your-own-adventure ""plot"" with multiple endings, and brouzouf for days (JUST GAIN SOME YOU DOUBLE JIAN), and the ability to literally get combat-induced PTSD, all come together to assuredly make EYE hands-down one of my favorite games ever.In short, if you like cyberpunk, bad English, good gameplay, and insanity, EYE: Divine Cybermancy is most undoubtedly for you.

												Imagine playing a lot of Deus Ex and S.T.A.L.K.E.R, ingesting illicit substances, knocking yourself out, and living in a terrifying dreamland for the next 24 hours. That dream would be E.Y.E: The Divine Cybermancy.  You play as a psychic cyborg space marine who has the power to jump several stories in the air, turn invisible, hack computers, clone himself instantly, and much more. If you want, you can sneak around levels stealthily and backstab enemies, or you can put on heavy armor and blow everything up with a minigun. Enemies still overpowering you? Use your psychic powers to drive them insane with hallucinations. If none of those work, you can remotely hack any computer on the level, including the cyborg brains of humans, and then mind control everyone. Once you hack someone's brain, you can see the world through their vision and give them commands. They'll struggle against your control, but if you keep mashing the ""attack"" button then sooner or later they'll kill all of their friends for you. Be careful, because any of these techniques can be used against you too. Invisible assassins can snipe you. Psychic monsters can empty your sanity meter, causing you to see imaginary enemies and explosions everywhere. If you chose to hack an enemy, their computer can load a counter virus and blow up your cyberbrain.As the plot develops, you slowly realize that your secret organization, the Secreta Secretorum, is wrapped up in a multilayered conspiracy bent on controlling all of society. Depending on the choices you make, you may learn that someone has been pulling the strings on all of the game's mysterious events, or you may discover that you're mind is being manipulated and nothing you've seen is real. Perhaps the entire game is only a recurring dream inside your character's mind. The truth may or may not be revealed in the end.I haven't even mentioned a lot of the other surreal aspects of it. Up to 32 people can play together in the campaign at once. About half of your dialog options will tell characters to ♥♥♥♥ themselves. Occasionally, after shooting someone, the game will inform you that you just killed a loving and caring daddy. You can use x-ray vision to shoot people through walls, make werewolves explode out of people, goomba-stomp people, deflect oncoming bullets with your katana, and at any time you can open a menu to research things XCOM-style. But even though you can assign a hundred scientists to analyze an eyeball you just found on the ground, you never even see a laboratory in the game.Unfortunately, the game suffers from many bugs and other issues which can make it frustrating for new players. It doesn't start you with any of the powers that make the game fun, and you have to grind for a lot of money to unlock them. Objectives often don't make sense, and the levels are huge, so finding the one thing you need can be frustrating. Even just navigating the main hub can be a chore. However, if you can get past all of that and enjoy the core of the game, then it's a ton of fun. ",110,47,1,15,7,0,27

												A lot of people say E.Y.E. is ""flawed"" and that is has ""unrealized"" potential. However, this implies that E.Y.E., bugs and unintended glitches aside, did not turn out the way the developers intended it to be. That's not really the case. I think a lot of misunderstandings  about E.Y.E. stem from the fact that a lot of people misunderstood what E.Y.E.is supposed to be. If for some reason you really want to understand the mentality that spawned E.Y.E. and why it is the way it is, here's my suggestion. Install Half-life 1 and play it if you haven't already, then play a bit of Sven Co-op. Then once this is done, go install the HL1 mod ""Syndicate Black Ops"". This mod was actually created by the devs of E.Y.E. and is it's predecessor for most intents and purposes.  After that, go play E.Y.E. again. There is a good chance that E.Y.E. will suddenly make sense, and its intentions will probably turn out to be not quite as lofty as you might have thought. E.Y.E. is not Deus Ex, STALKER, Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines, and it was never meant to be. It sort of reaches in that direction but it stems from a different place. The notion that E.Y.E. was supposed to be like one of those games was shot down by the devs early on, but people wanted a game like that so badly they were willing to believe that it was one of those games anyway and so eventually they just rolled with it. E.Y.E. comes from an alternate world where games like Deus Ex, System Shock 2, and STALKER became huge successes and sold as much as CoD does in our world. It has RPG mechanics, various tools, a hacking system, inventory management, leaning, and all the sorts of mechanics we associate with a more ""sophisticated"" game, but these are just a means and in this case they are not matched with ""sophisticated"" ends.  In this case, they are all here to further the objective of ""killing tons of enemies"" and ""being a badass"".E.Y.E. has respawning enemies because if they didn't respawn you'd run out of enemies to kill. Stealth is not fleshed out because stealth is not intended as a gameplay approach by itself, it's just another tool to help you kill more enemies, and in this case it works quite well. Hacking lets you do all sorts of interesting things, but it's also meant to be just another tool you use to be a badass killing machine and is not its own separate play-style. The cybernetic and magic themes are not there to provoke deep thought, they're there just for flavor and to cram in more abilities to make you a badass killing machine. If that's not enough gameplay for you by itself then you're probably going to hate the game because that's what the gameplay is and for better or worse that's what it intended to be. The game was mad by and for people who find this sort of play to be satisfying. The confusing plot that people like to speculate about is just the icing on the cake and excuse to have the sorts of weird locations and maps the game has. It has a story of course but again it's mostly there to justify sending the player to odd places. The game has magical werewolves and space stoner hippies, that should have clued people in that this isn't a super-serious plot or setting. There's a random guy in one of the levels who's depressed and you can talk him into incinerating himself. He doesn't exist to change anything, he's there for the ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles. That's a pretty good summary of how ""serious"" or ""deep"" the plot is meant to be. Anyway, there's my review of E.Y.E., interpret that how you will.			",101,11,0,11,27,0,28

With a very special thanks to RoosterTheRed for proof-reading this review, E.Y.E is a first-person shooter roleplaying game set in a futuristic society in which several factions compete for resources and overall control. You play as a custom character comprised of a chosen set of skills, races, and equipment; as with many other roleplaying titles, these attributes can be altered during the game’s course. Though complex in the beginning, E.Y.E delivers a fantastic overall theme that only enhances the gameplay and in-game decisions. This game includes solo, cooperative, and competitive play options, though it is recommended to play this game with friends or other individuals you know given the fact that the online community is quite scarce in number; this should not be too much of an issue since the base game presents a wide array of playability.Here are just a few things I found of interest in Blat-Blat: Sneaky Shiz (inside joke):Roleplaying Aspects - Within E.Y.E’s in-depth theme, described more thoroughly in a further segment) is the ability to generate and decide conflicts as a character of your choosing. There are multiple humanoid racial archetypes you can choose from, and three can be selected in any combination to grant favored bonuses; a guide is heavily recommended for new players deciding on what race or races to be lest their original tabletop, A.V.A, was reviewed. Beyond this elaborate statistics system in which players can assign skills more pertinent to their style of play by allotting points into such expertise as Hacking. As the player gains levels, they may apportion more points into their skills, and specific upgrades and abilities can be purchased if the player’s character has the prerequisite skill efficiency. Throughout the campaign there are many decisions that can be made to influence the remaining story or side quests, which causes the balance between the multiple existing parties to shift slightly. Another interesting topic is Research, which can be performed from the in-game menu at virtually any time. Research grants the player items such as the healing syringe, as well as additional lore and weapons.Unique Overworld - This title’s theme is widely regarded as steampunk, though I find it to be more reminiscent of Warhammer 40,000’s flavor. Regardless, it maintains a glimpse of a grim future, with rivaling factions, psionic powers, monsters, and magic. Character designs are engaging, and enemy forces are both laughable-referring to the forces with afros-and menacing at times. Scarabs-similar to Skull Servitors in Warhammer 40,000-and other technological advances blend nicely with the atmosphere since a given majority of objects can be hacked or modified. The overworld has a gloomy noir feel to it which amplifies the theme of warring parties while retaining individuality.Gameplay - E.Y.E melds several interesting components together into one combat system which can be experienced in a variety of ways. Items are displayed in an overly of the character in a depiction as to what they can carry in a grid-based format; this generally means that you can bear as much as can be “on your person.” Gameplay is fluid, with varying forms of firearms and melee weapons at the player’s disposal to aide in eliminating hostiles. The previously described Research system also plays a vital role in weapon selection since weapons and items such as the Gatling gun and medical syringe, respectively, can be developed for use. Players are able to hack objects for certain gains such as opening a secret compartment behind a locked door, and are even able to be hacked back by the object they are targeting; it’s strange but highly humorous. Psionic powers can also be used in combat. Examples of this include creating multiple clones of the player, performing a devastating sprinting melee attack, transmuting all grounded items into health pickups, and passively increasing jump elevation. There are also several purchasable upgrades from venders which add new powers and improve known skills. All of these allow the player to develop their own style of play apart from the usual ‘kill everything that moves and forget anything else’ approach many other first-person shooters adopt.Hidden Content - Though mostly prompted by side missions, there are many undiscovered bounties stowed around the map. One such is a treasure that few players have discovered-including myself-within the vicinity of a huge map. These objectives add a great amount of depth to E.Y.E, as well as replayability.TL:DR - E.Y.E offers an enormous amount of content for players who enjoy roleplaying games and intriguing lore combined with a variety of actions, upgrades, and choices in-game. This title does have its quirks in regards to certain features but its gameplay style makes up for this as a motley roleplaying experience unlike many. This title is highly recommended for those who pursue games that blend tactics and combat, as well as those how persistently go out of their way to unravel secrets.

												Okay so I got this game when it was 90% off for just $0.99. I excpected it to be one of those, well you know, $0.99 games. Turns out, I was totally wrong.I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game. The aethetic and storyline (to me) is awesome. The coop is great. I love the ideas they implemented into game, things like hacking, psi force, and your character's mental stability. The combat is enjoyable.Now there are a couple of cons. The new things I mentioned, while I like their ideas, I feel like some were implemented poorly, making it less viable to be a certain class, but this is something that doesn't bother me too much, and I don't think it will bother you much either.Personally, I hope one day, one ♥♥♥♥ing day some gaming company sees this and buys the rights to it and makes a sequel. I firmly believe that if a sequel was made and it refined not just the graphics physics engine, and added voice acting, but fully developed the features added to the game, this could easily be GOTY material.Thanks for reading.

												Wonderfully original and mind-boggling.I'm not sure how much of that is due to the poor translation, but if you choose to play this game, know that there is a lot of unexplained information.It's the game that combines religious, military, cyberpunk, and revolutionary themes that I never knew I wanted. Sometimes you feel strong, and other times you feel weak. I was mostly occupied trying to figure out what's going on while I completed objectives, but it all came together for moments that made me feel like I was watching a big movie like Star Wars for the first time.Definitely play this.

												I'll recommend this game, but only if you can get it on a sale of some sort.While the game is a little bit glitchy in terms of saving from time to time, most of the time it holds up really well. After validating, I've only had it crash once. Translations aren't perfect, and some of the words are just really hard to pronounce, much less know how to spell off hand. Though, this isn't really obstructive to gameplay, given you can easily figure things out if you think for a few moments.The game won't tell you all the default keys, you're going to want to check those, as the tutorial isn't going to answer that for you either. The tutorials frankly aren't that beneficial, they'll give you the very basic, but fully employing something is going to take trial and error.Actual gameplay wise... The game is great really, you're not restricted to just being the heavy armored titan who shambles along mowing down everything he sees. Sure, in the beginning you're going to be more or less locked into the basic strategies of, long range versus close range... But very soon, you'll be able to make yourself capable of stealth, tanking, hacking, and more.To explain what I mean to those thinking of buying this game:The game does have a stealth system. It's normally impossible to be stealthy unless you use the cloak implant that you can buy pretty early in. If you hit someone who hasn't detected you, you will get a pretty nicely sized modifier to your hit.Hacking; is actually a very powerful tool in the game if you can get a few good strategies for it going. You can quite literally make your enemies turn against each other, ignore, and even defend you. You can take a glance through someone's eyes... Or you can flat out cause brain death by hacking a person. However, hacking isn't possible on all enemies in the game.There's varieties of every type of gun in the game, each with a unique aspect. Just looking at melee, the Distortion Hammer is big, heavy, slow... But it causes massive damage, and it can work great as a shield (yes, you can block using weapons, bigger weapons are better at blocking). There's also the dual blades, which are fast, lethal, but lack the damage per hit and blocking power of the hammer. In short; you can play it light, quiet and quick... Or big, heavy, and monsterous... With any weapon really.Your ""special"" stuff doesn't come from killstreaks or anything like that, no, they come from two branches of specials, which are purchasable/earnable. Cyber Implants and Psy Powers. Implants are all purchasable, but psypowers; some are purchasable, others have to be earned.Cyber Implants have mostly basic effects, improving your aim, hardening your skin, making you invisible to enemies, making you jump higher and run faster...Whereas Psy Powers... Are much more specialized. Creating tissue paper clones of yourself to shoot at enemies, turning ammo into health, health into energy, killing and teleporting to your target, among others.Now, the reason why I say that you should buy this game if it's on sale...Is that while it's well made in terms of creating an atmosphere, being unique, and giving you plenty to play with... The actual stuff you'll be fighting.. Is pretty slim in diversity.Sentries, Scrabs, Jiang, Carnophage, Looter, Manduco, Synicle, Federal Cop, Special Force, Deus Ex, Interceptor, Kraak, Perigrum Forma, and Patrol.That is every non-named in the entire game. Which as you can imagine gets pretty repetitive. Different weapons but pretty much the same thing.You can configure AI, but most of the time, enemies seem to be great at finding, and shooting you even from long distances. Even on the lowest ""reinforcement"" spawn, you might find yourself swarmed with over a dozen of a single enemy, who automatically path towards you from their spawn point just a few feet away. Yes, that is a problem with the game, respawns of enemies are pretty bad. They'll spawn at set points, ones which can be easily memorized given they're largely just open space most of the time, and you can literally walk to that spot... Wait, and then take newly spawned enemies by surprise, mowing them down with ease.Not all gamestyles are that rewarding.If you hack a lot, you'll find you're getting a disproportionate amount of XP to money.If you sneak a lot (ghosting through missions, which is possible nicely enough), you'll find you're low on everything, given there's not much of a bonus to being unseen at all times aside from getting shot less.If you raise a machine army of Scrabs and Sentries... Expect them to die. If a non-machine ally gets hit by one by accident (very easy given sentries are machine guns), they will kill your machine.Ally AI is pretty bad, you'll find yourself getting trapped in corners and in hallways by allies who don't realize you trying to walk through them is a cue to move out of the way... And often times, when they do move, they'll move just to get in your way again, because you found a way past them. They're also totally dumb in terms of vision and sound. If they didn't get shot, and they're not looking at whoever's firing dozens of rounds a minute... No matter how many times you get hit, they will not turn around to help you. Your only hope is to just pray they randomly turn in time to help you. Allies especially are pretty bad when it comes to getting in the way of you defending yourself. They are quite literally the last thing you want when you're using a sniper rifle at long range, as they won't hesitate to step in front of you right when you're aiming, or even shooting, causing you to have to move so they're not blocking you anymore... Or just kill them.All in all...The game is a great idea, it's got a great design... But the amount of small things that will make you go, ""That's such a simple thing... How could they not get that right? Or at least fix it?"" is pretty high in number.  The game does make you think though in terms of strategy, using your environment to your advantage, which is definitely it has going for it. But I digress...Unless you have played it before, or you have cash you're willing to gamble, or it's on sale...Don't buy it.If you end up liking this game, chances are... You will LOVE it. But it really depends on who you are and what you look for in a game. It's not your typical FPS, it's not your typical RPG, it's not your typical anything really. It's a mash of several genres, and while I do love it, and recommend it...I do understand it's not for everyone; the environment/lore might be a turn off for people, or you might find it to enhance the experience. This formula works out for many aspects of the game.... And so like I said;It's one hell of a game. Whether or not you love it, is on you.			",33,4,0,10,14,0,2

												While it may say 42 hours on record, my actual record in E.Y.E is 84. So I think I have enough experience with this game to finally review it.First off, I'm just going to warn future buyers that E.Y.E is a game that appeals to a very specific kind of player, generally players who are fans of the first Deus Ex from 2000's. I had to learn this the hard way after suggesting this to many of my friends only for them to judge the game as broken or unfinished. It's not for everyone, and even though I enjoyed this game I can understand why people don't like it.So what exactly is E.Y.E? E.Y.E Divine Cybermancy is a cyber punk FPS RPG drug trip published and developed by Streum. In E.Y.E Divine Cybermancy you customize your character(s) and shape them into different paths that the game has set for you (and no, you cannot customize your character's gender or body type, it's only on a stat level) The game has quite a learning curve at the very start of the game so when the game throws a needle in your face and tells you to inject yourself full of cybernetic Chi...You pick some traits that sounds cool only to find out you've made the worst character in existance.You can also select different armor types for whatever playthrough you're going with, such as: Light armor, which allows you to run faster and cloak more effectively but very fragile and next to useless at the end game. It's good for a stealth or Psi run if you are sitting on a large amount of stamina, but that's about it. Medium armor, a bit slower than light armor but can take a fair amount of punishment. This armor is decent from early to mid game and sometimes late game depending on what role you went with. But chances are you're going to want heavy armor on mars. And finally Heavy armor, this armor is a little too strong for it's own good. It can tank massive amounts of damage and if you have a chaingun, you might as well be considered a living turret. There isn't a whole lot of mobs in early to mid game that can potentially stop you other than demons. The only flaw to this armor is it's speed, but when you look at the Heavy armor's benefits, it simply makes the game a whole lot easier to play. The Plot  It's really hard to say what the plot is, or at least where it's going. There are several different theories floating around on the forums and none of which have managed to explain as to what in the hell is going on. You play as some cybernetic ninja/samurai/knight/zombie. And if that hasn't already driven you off then I congratulate you, you are perhaps more devoted to insane indie games than I am.You wake up from some nightmare (or vision) only to find yourself in a cave cluttered with bodies and blood stains. You then recieve a message from your 'Mentor' saying you need to get out of the cave before the federals find you. Once you have arrived at the HQ you will get a lecture from your mentor about how you were captured and a reminder of the curent state of the proxy war with the two factions within E.Y.E, the Jians and the Culter. After your chat with him, you are greeted by some kind of floating metal box with a gun attached saying you left a message for yourself.  You learn that you have amneisa (obviously) and that there was a mission on mars that went to hell and back with you somehow in the mix of it.That's pretty much the easiest to understand. But after that the story itself takes a nose dive into the chaotic storm that is insanity, leaving you with no idea as to what your objective is or why you are doing it.A lot of players claim that's what makes E.Y.E enjoyable, but I had to play the game in small sips because of the garbled plot. So you better like Source engine, shooting the same models of enemies over and over again, and grinding for research items because the story is not worth paying attention to. The Game  I'm not going to lie to you, this game is a fresh breath of air in this MoBA/action shooter dominated industry. This game does a good job of creating a unique Cyberpunk setting despite being limited by the constraints of the Source engine. And if there is another E.Y.E installment, I would prefer it still used Source simply because it seems to work well with the game. You also have the advantage of anyone on a potato could play it. But there are many problems with E.Y.E that make it hard to create an enjoyable experience. First of all the guns and the way they feel are horrible. This is once again, probably because of the Source engine because so far I have yet to play a Source game with satisfying gunplay. The other flaw with guns is the progression (or the progression of this game in general) in which they are unlocked. The majority of them are already unlocked and most of the default weapons are far better than what you can purchase (excluding the power hammer and the Bear Killer) I'm not sure what the development was like for this game, but this is basic progression logic completely ignored.Finally the maps- The true problem with the maps in E.Y.E is just the emptiness, there aren't any civilian NPC's (no I am not counting the bandits as civilian NPC's) Without civilians walking around it just takes away the atmosphere. It's that hateful moment when you stop and think ""oh yeah, I'm in a video game..."" Hell, there's even a map called New Eden where you can run into apartments and quickly find out that there is no living human being in a single room.Speaking of human population, if you aren't fond of the whole ""women as trophies"" thing then you are not going to like any mission involving bandits. Because a large portion of their quests involve stealing sex slaves or some rubbish like that. Ironically, there are no in-game female models, they are only mentioned....So as far as you know you're stealing nothing but a poor man's depraved wet dream. Have FUN!And lastly the multiplayer. The multiplayer is really disappointing simply because there are only two game modes and next to no population playing them. The first game mode is Battle Royale where you spawn in the map with a random selection of armor and weapons, there is also perma death so caution rewards. The next game mode is a little bit different, you take a spiked orb from one side of the map to the other with your team, so death basket ball royale to be frank. This game mode unfortunately only has about 2 or 4 maps and zero population playing it. So Co-op is really where this game's strength is, but I still consider PVP as content so I'm including it in the review. Final Verdict  There is a lot more to cover but some of it could potentially spoil the game or turn you off completely. So my rating for E.Y.E Divine Cybermancy is a 7/10! The game offers a lot of choices but ironically doesn't allow you to pick a side between Culter and Jians, or develop your character's personality. But what really ruins the experience is the plot itself. If the game kept a plot and ran with it instead of sending you off on a wild goose chase, I might have been easier on it. But that would have to be my biggest complaint with E.Y.E.However, E.Y.E Divine Cybermancy is reasonably priced at $9.99 and even lower on sales ($2.99 or $0.99) so if you don't enjoy it you won't be horribly punished by your purchase. But between the limits of the Source Engine and the lack of experience with game progression it's understandable why some people would call this unfinished. I cannot blame anyone for saying so, but I also cannot agree that this game is worthless. So a 7/10 would have to be the best I can award it without being too biased.			",112,1,0,6,2,0,16

												E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy is a shooter with one of the most interesting setting I have ever seen in a video games, and it has an amazing atmosphere too! While the writing is really bad, it doesn't get in a way too much and the story can be ignored. While the game is just decent in singleplayer, E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy is probably the best co-op multiplayer shooter I have ever played. It's not just about shooting too, as players can use various PSI abilities and other kinds of skills too. I recommend getting it with friends to play together. However, if you have no friends, then it's pretty good too, albeit you will miss the strongest point of the game.			",390,117,27,79,52,1,87

												EYE is one of those few games that leaves me severely wanting more but is also almost perfect the way it is. The almost is there because there are some annoying bugs, and you may need to do what I did which is backup the save files every time you exited due to some of the bugs. There was one stage in particular that gave me a great deal of grief, but the elements were there, especially the hacking, and the story kept me interested too. It's true, the story will not make sense even if you do get the 'true' ending, but it's possible to piece together some idea of a story which has worked for games like Killer 7 or Hotline Miami. If you like reading into things and speculating about story, it will probably capture you too. Just look into those bugs and back up from the beginning.			",205,74,0,14,13,1,7

												The trailers suggest that EYE is an indie Deus Ex, allowing varied playing styles. Sadly this isn’t true. It’s combat heavy with constantly respawning enemies. The cloak runs out too quickly, the maps are huge with wide open spaces and not enough cover, to make stealth a viable tactic. The plot doesn’t make sense to me, partly due to a poor translation from the native French language resulting in NPC dialogue lacking proper grammar, and partly because allies give updated orders during missions while you’re too busy trying to not die, so it’s hard to concentrate on what is being said, and every mission becomes a case of just following the waypoint marker and shooting some guys or pressing a button without ever really knowing why. Yes, there are some complex character stats and abilities and the shooting is okay, but nowhere near as entertaining as Serious Sam for mindless violence. Ultimately I can only recommend EYE on a Steam sale if you’ve got nothing better to play.			",145,31,0,15,8,2,16

												It's been a while since I last reviewed a game on Steam - or anywhere else for that matter - and to break this trend I decided to write up some of my experiences with the things I've been playing. As a bonus, I will try to make use of the text formatting that has been introduced by Steam in the meantime.IntroductionFirst up on that list is E.Y.E Divine Cybermancy (abbreviated as EYE from here on), an FPS/RPG crossover made by the relatively unknown ‘Streumon Studio’, which should sound familiar if you have played the Half Life 1 total conversion mod called ‘Syndicate Black Ops’. On a sidenote here: people have been notifying me that some of the games I write about are rather old and as such my efforts might not be read by anyone. I’m fully aware of this and it is no problem to me. Some games stand the passing of time well and others even manage to become more appealing as they age, a phenomena caused by nostalgia and the fact that this industry is being saturated by bad titles.MeritI would consider EYE one of the latter category. While it is certainly not ugly, I wouldn’t dare call it a beautiful game either. A disadvantage with realism as far as graphics are concerned is that they do not measure up to titles that release later on. Of course that’s an unfair comparison, but it’s one that will be made regardless. Games like World of Warcraft that go for the full comic book style graphics can sport ‘kiddy’ visuals for years to come, but has it done their setting any justice? Only a fanboy would concur. Instead, realistic graphics has to come with dramatization in order to increase the shelf like for the demanding gamer. The most obvious examples would be the brilliant bloom effects in Lineage 2’s Angel Waterfall, the gold shaders in Deus Ex: Human Revolution, or the blend of drawings with old graphics used in the Mount & Blade series. While EYE has constituted their theme pretty well, the use of some low resolution textures and models here and there can still break the immersion. That aside, it’s a very good effort that is very commendable, especially during the dream and certain parts of the HQ. In fact, in some parts it's quite extreme, think of huge power cables running through the streets and even fighting on Mars.The strength of EYE definitely appears to be the character customization but the sounds and shooting mechanics are actually more fleshed out. At first this might seem like an odd thing to say as there are many powers and augmentations to choose from, however, as you progress through the levels you will come to find that specializing your character in a specific playstyle does not pay off. With the current state of the variables it is much more viable to build a generic tank/gunner as  the other powers are either too taxing or influence your character too little to make much of a difference in battle. My character is currently level 40+ and having failed to be a drone master – since every enemy in the game gets tougher and my drones only gained a one time marginal HP increase and cannot be replenished during firefights – I noticed that straightforward upgrades related to gun performance and health will give you better results. It’s rather sad, but I understand that these niche playstyles are uncommon so they are represented less.Last, but not leastIf you read my reviews before you will probably be wondering why I haven’t mentioned anything about the storyline yet, the reason for that is that I can’t. The storyline isn’t bad, just very complicated! I will really need to finish a couple more playthroughs to really get the gist of it. In conclusionAll in all, E.Y.E Divine Cybermancy is a well designed game assuming a setting that is underrepresented in comparison to other themes. If you enjoy cyberpunk then you have probably come at the right address, though keep in mind that the theme is anything but subtle and the customization could be better.			",116,12,7,6,17,0,15

												So let's try writing some review for these games I have. Anyways,E.Y.E. You're a stupidly wierd game.Good:The gameplay is fun for what it is, and I never got tired of the cool factor of being able to block machine gun fire with my sword or being able to hack into someone's skull to make them explode. Couple of other gadgets you start with too, and you have quite a few upgrades and new guns you can get that may or may not be fun to use. It never really gets painfully hard either, which I consider a redeeming factor for this incoherent game.There are plenty of free missions and locales that you can play, several fun to use weapons, pyschic powers, a campaign that doesn't overstay it's welcome, and an awesome atmosphere that is both tense and unsettling. The entire setting has a nice cyberpunk feel to it, and there's plenty of cool factor to spare.Bad:If you are expecting any kind of story to enjoy than good luck. Confusing English and a lack of explanation makes the story hard to follow at best. It doesn't help that the story plays with some insanity tropes as well; making things even more confusing. The rpg mechanics are worthless, and I never really felt like I became anything special aside from just a samurai guy. Some of the systems like magic/psychic power feels underdeveloped, and the insanity thing, which actually is an interesting mechanic for the game, can be removed by an 'upgrade'. As far as combat goes: the A.I. is ridiculous. One little detection can result in the entire enemy army walking in a straight line towards your location. There is also this weird critical hit/negative hit system, but I've killed enemies in one hit with a ""Failed Attack"" several times so I don't know what to make of that. Overall, The whole thing just feels marred by poor design choices.The story is confusing as a story can get. The core rpg mechanics lack complexity. There are way too dang many large empty areas. A.I. is clumsy at best. And you'll probably go through the whole game without buying or upgrading anything. Don't expect to be impressed anywhere here; there's just a lot of boring trash beneath a paper thin shine.Overall:It's a game you have to play simply for the experience. Just to play for the overall unique strangeness of the setting. To get sucked in to the weirdness of the story about a cybernetic super samurai who may or may not be insane. It has it's cool moments to help things a long too, and to say again, you start with a sword that can block pretty much anything and sets people on fire.But, if you are expecting a solid experience then you probably won't be amused by this at all. The game requires you to overlook a lot of problems. If it were even a little bit better I would change my overall opinion here. But there is just nothing to guarantee you will like this, so that's why I would not recommend it.			",112,17,0,10,2,0,2

												Where to ♥♥♥♥ing start?Okay, the reason I am recomending this game is not necessarily because it has the capacity to be enjoyable, which it totally does, but because this game is just so ♥♥♥♥ing weird that I like it, or I hate it, I'm not quite sure. It is a game that defies criticism and defies review.The game is absolutely littered with problems and it isn't really designed spectacularly well, yet, just look at it, look at it, with your face, use your eyes and see the mess that is this game. I feel like I am going crazy here. Am I the only one seeing this? They literally included 32 player co-op as a thing because... why the ♥♥♥♥ not? It totally breaks the game but have it anyways.This is probably the most horrifying thing I have ever played and it isn't trying to be a horror game, it has given me nightmares since I bought it over a year ag because I have literally had panic attacks while playing this game. One of the bullet points on the steam page says, ""Psychological and mental trauma management,"" which is totally meant as like a feature of the game but it really means the mental and psychological trauma this game will cause you, in real life, to your sanity. I think I have enough evidence to file for psychological abuse.You may think I meant for this to be a would not recomend review but no, I totally 100% recomend this game. I sincerely believe everyone should buy and play this game. You just have to see this♥♥♥♥♥♥ it is truly baffling. It's bad but it's good, it's really good. It's a world you will keep coming back to because you want to try to understand it, but you won't, you won't understand it. I know, I've played it. This game is, to me, an example of what all sci-fi should aspire to be, a complete non-sensical mess that gives you more questions than answers.Oh and I guess there is multiplayer now.TL;DR - Panic Attack Simulator 2011 GOTY edition			",246,48,2,22,18,1,21

												This is an RPG combined with FPS.It has some great ideas, but they're hard to spot because of overall crudeness.First and the most annoying: it's dark. Too dark. Unless you're walking with your eye implant always on - you can't see a thing.Second: lack of descent tutorial and explanation. Here, have this complex game, figure out by yourself how to enjoy it.Third: I understand that devs wanted to force players to use tactics other than brute force... Well, it's great for hardcore players and all, but there is a huge downside: if you don't know beforehand which tactics you need to use to win this mission, you'll fail. More than once.Fourth: and here we arrive to ridiculous saving system. Your progress is saved. All the time. But every time you're brought back to the last checkpoint (these are VERY rare). For example: I talked with Mentor during the mission, got a ton of exp, disconnected... Resumed the game and I can talk to Mentor once more to gain ton of exp once more. I just happened to do that 5 or so times.			",50,14,0,10,3,0,8

												The game struck me a cross between Ghost in the Shell and Deus Ex fighting in Total Recall.There is a great deal of build customization to suit your playstyle from jaunting sniper to ogre brute with a sword. The tutorial is not very helpful at all. If you don't like trial and error tinkering you should probably go straight to a guide for mechanics and loadout.I enjoyed the game for its novelty and variety of playstyles but ultimately abandoned it. For some reason any lenghty gameplay sessions left me with some annoying headaches (literally, not sure if it was the lighting or the movement).I can't really recommend this game unless your a big fan of the dystopian sci-fi genre or are looking for something different to play and want something like Fallout in an Unreal Tournament world with tighter gunplay and less need for talking.

												ONE OF THE BEST GAMES I'VE EVER PLAYED!I don't understand the amount of complaining. It's a complex, RPG/FPS. This game is not for the weak minded or impatient. This game has a STEEP learning curve but once you learn it, it's honestly one of the best games you will ever play. I picked this game up a few years back, tried playing it, regretfully said, ""Eh, to complicated, I'll play it later."" I just recently actually gave it a shot. I had to read through forums to learn essentially how the game works, but now that I have given it a chance, this game is hands down one of the best I have ever played. Sure, it's aged and sure it has some issues but this game is so ♥♥♥♥ing addictive once you get it going. 10/10			",229,29,0,13,5,0,5

This game has the open world maps of Metro Last Light and all the augments, weapons, and complexity of Deus Ex and Metal Gear Solid. A Cult classic that is just begging for a sequel.

												Simply put, that game is boring, repetitive, and once you're in mission, unless you know exactly what to research to become invisible, you'll be CONSTANTLY attacked.Add to this that maps are big but full of nothing, that dialogues are boring, that the enemy can sometimes be hard to spot in the darkness, and you get a boring game, with a boring overly-complicated plot.It doesn't help that the fanbase is extremely biased, with explanation such as ""if you don't understand, you're clearly a moron"", and ""it's made that way, don't play if you don't like"".Wouldn't recommend.

It's true that EYE features many RPG elements. It has dialogue, branching paths, levels, inventory management, stores and side-missions. But this is all plays second fiddle to what EYE is really aiming for. It's not a Deus Ex as much as it is a Serious Sam. It's not a Borderlands as much as it is a Painkiller. I really cannot emphasize this enough, it's my belief that the majority of the complaints directed towards EYE stem from a false presupposition of what this game is trying to be. That is not the players fault though, because EYE doesn't exactly make these things clear.EYE is a mess.Unless you are a Dwarf Fortress player, EYE is likely to be the biggest, messiest game you are ever likely to see. Right off the bat it gives you a character creation screen which makes absolutely no sense to anyone beginning the game without first googling what in the hell you are looking at. The dialogue is either intentionally vague, bizarre and most of the time incomprehensible. You will be thrown into a world which appears to have some sort of lore and backstory but you'll be lucky if you ever understand a tenth of what is going on. When the game presents you with the tutorial level, many aspects of that tutorial will need tutorials themselves, and you will be confronted with a library of tutorial videos on how certain game mechanics work. Your body can be hacked and destroyed by doors and ATMs. Sometimes huge monsters will appear in the level and fire rockets in directions you didn't even know existed and you have to kill it. Sometimes you'll be tasked to kill a high ranking enemy and he will zip about the game shooting and cloaking tanking hits like nothing else. This game is primarily single-player, but you can have 64-player coop. You can buy spells and augmentations and guns and big hammers all with a currency called Brozouf which you seem to endlessly gain in areas where you are doing something for some reason for someone. EYE is a deranged and twisted mess of Syndicate, Neuromancer, Warhammer 40k and the entire personal drug stash of Hunter S. Thompson. And you know what? It's amazing.There is no messing around with regenerating health, cover or killcams. You can go in fast and furious or heavy like robocop. The guns feel like they should. There is real impact when you shoot something. Enemies will go flying across the screen. You can teleport into people and laugh as they explode. You can hit people in the face with giant hammers and watch as they bounce off the walls. You can hack people. You can force push four-armed creatures into radioactive goo. You can block bullets with swords. This game can be anything you want, but above all it is satisfying. If you get this game, it's imperative that you know what you getting into. If you want a cyberpunk dystopia with thought provoking dialogue and choices that mean something, I don't advise you to get this game. If you want a crazy FPS that is a completely unapologetic mess that explains nothing but offers everything then I would strongly recommend this game.			",39,0,1,2,1,0,1

												Ah, this title is a devisive one.If you want to have a game with fun, tight, intense shooting, atmospheric enviornments, lots of ways to accomplish objectives, non-linear gameplay, and really in-depth systems, then pick this one up. However, if you're getting it to recieve gripping story and/or narrative, user friendliness, or just polish in general, then I wouldn't recommend this one. It's simple as that, really. If you do plan on picking it up, prepare yourself for the learning curve- it's pretty brutal. Nevertheless, I enjoy the game. It was worth the dollar I spent on it.			",103,7,1,11,7,1,1

												I strongly recommend this game if you want to play a unique game which offers you (IF you manage to get into it) an fantastic gameplay with tons of fun.PROS:- good story with 3 different endings- tons of sidemissions (All randomized)- huge maps- modable (But no Workshop)- Source engine- SPLATTER!- unique gameplay which offers you to play the way you want- many psi powers- possibility to jump around the map and kill everyone like a ninja on drugs- really fun with friends- realistic injuries and causes of death (e.g. drugoverdose because of too much healing)- there is ALWAYS a server to play- NO DLC's (!)- COOP and PvP- different enemy ranks (e.g. Captains, Seargents, etc.)- different enemy types- ...CONS- graphics not the best for todays expactations- hard to get into (but with the T-key most problems will get solved (it opens ingame videos in the game))- sometimes the game is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (because it is so hard, well which is also a PRO I think?)- there aren't many players around to play withWell thats it. I recommend it to buy it when it is on a sale for 1 or 2 bucks so you dont make a mistake if you dont like it (Though 10 bucks aren't much).89/100PLEASE READ: The videos you see above are just some multiplayer PvP modes. But the game is not about the PvP!			",193,24,3,23,27,0,33

												There are absolutely no words for this game, and yet it is probably one of my favorite RPGs now. Sacrifice 27 humans to the skeletal king of the werewolves! Enter a paranoid hallucinatory trance! Marvel as a man you shot and killed on Earth not five minutes earlier returns to life, shakes your hand, and runs into combat... on MARS! Become a psychic god and decimate enemies with brain-powered clones of yourself! Create an army of sentry turrets and watch them slay enemies eternally as you hack gunships for backup! Charge directly into battle with a nuclear-powered warhammer! THERE IS NO WRONG WAY TO PLAY THIS INSANE MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING GAME.I urge you to buy and play this game at length. 4 endings minimum and a branching story. Join the villains, even! It's cool with that choice.			",2447,961,90,309,287,27,386

												You gain BrouzoufMy Legs are OK10/10Jokes aside, this game is probably one of the best games that exploits the Source Engine at it's finest.I can't give you a story background on this, because it's really hard to understand, but you're somewhere near 2500, and it's the end of times, factions fight each other.This game is mostly about Co-op with your friends or as much people as you'd like.You pick your weapons, level up, spend Brouzouf to raise certain stats or buy certain locked weapons and just have fun!It may feel weird at first, but play this with friends and I guarantee it's worth it.

												E.Y.E ...... This game is a mash up of system shock, borderlands and deus ex. But the thing is that it does it so well. The game has a very steap learning curve in terms of the skill system and overall RPG elements, but the game is insanely good fun, combat is insane and over the top with weapons that could level nations. The story is good as well. A couple of twists and turns keep you on your toes. I recommend this game to anyone who wants to play something ""Different"" in terms of the linear titles out today.Final Score: 79/100			",227,11,6,18,16,2,32

												A delicious game that took many by surprise, E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy is one of those purchases that will keep you coming back for more.What you need to know:Amazing use of the Source engine, sporting great visuals and environments.  Even the weapons have several animation states!Sounds are pleasing, and the soundtrack is VERY pleasing.  (Though, you will have to dig into the game files to grab the music.)Melee weapons, handguns, rifles, shotguns, high-explosives, and even a hammer.  Not to mention crazy psychic voodoo-magic.  Also you can clone yourself, and your clones will even level up based on your stats, as well.Some great, uh, voiceacting.  Trust me, you'll find it quite amusing at times.Gameplay is excellent.  Hacking is a challenge, and the gunplay is satisfying.  Also, you can kill people by throwing hamburger boxes at high speeds and that's funny to me.Standalone missions to play outside of story mode even support randomized enemy spawns, and random-picked objectives.  And to add to that, cooperative mode allows many players to play through the story mode seamlessely.  Lots of achievements, if you're into that.---------------The downsides:A blast in singleplayer, but the game truly becomes a gem with friends.The translation quality on ingame texts is.. err..It can take some time to find the randomly-dropping researches, and money grows on your character a bit slowly.  Dying is EXTREMELY dangerous, as it can apply perma-debuffs to your character's stats.  That is, until you sink enough time and money into research to prevent them entirely.Community for it is a bit stagnant, and while custom maps are possible, pretty much none exist.Multiplayer PVP feels strange, and multiplayer itself has some odd bugs.  IE: Lives are shared across all players, meaning somebody dying multiple times can kick EVERYONE back to the lobby map.  Some maps even end up killing the host when a client dies in some areas.  All physics objects also effect other players, so you CAN kill someone else with a high-velocity object, even if PVP is disabled.  Oh, all NPC's (even friendly ones!) are affected by damage, so it's easy for one player to null-void the entire lobby map of NPC's to buy from.  Ouch.Re-playability tends to DIE after some time of playing it, but it has enough to offer to make you come back after a while as well.  (You'll probably get tons of hours through a single chunk of playing through it all, though.  Even more with friends!)---------------All in all, great game.  REALLY glad I was able to play this, and hope you will too.			",154,7,2,9,6,1,17

												This game makes me sad and angry. Because it has so much potential, but it has some fatal flaws that just ruin the experience. Enemy spawning issues, enemies knowing where you are all the time, enemies have ridiculous sight distance that far outclasses your own, making stealth basically impossible in some areas. This game has lots of issues like these that really dampens the experience. Which is a shame, because it seems like it has potential to be a fantastic game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is hard to get into, hard to master, and for most people the first hours are a real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥. Yes, you´ll either love it or hate it, it´s a very unique game.        <<<<<THE BEGINNING>>>>> You are thrown into a world you probably wouldn´t imagine in your weirdest weed-caused dreams. You are a guy who lost all his memories (yes, this setting is very commonly used;). You make your way out of a dark cave, where you get attacked by the first enemy: a rather small two-legged red monster spitting fireballs. After some minutes in, you realize that somehow the cave leads to the very top of a industrial building used as Military base. You gear up: Double Katanas, Pistols, , Revolvers, MGs, Assault rifles, Sniper Rifles, do you want Armor? A light, medium or heavy one? Drones? Medipacks? Remote Turrets? Grenades?)  You then kill some old-fashioned fallout-like brotherhood-of-steel guys who decided to spend their free time and roam around in a lonely cold wet canal next to the building complex. Jump into the sewers, bash annoying punks there, get out, make an attempt to hack a door but fail desperately the first time, get hacked back by the door as you think                   ""What am I doing here?!""  At this point, most people quit the game and uninstall it. E.Y.E makes it very hard for beginners to get into the mechanics, and you have to figure out almost everything by yourself. But after you get used to it, the game is definitely worth your time. There are 10+ unique designed open-world levels you can replay anytime with optional side quests and randomly-generated objectives.          <<<<<GAMEPLAY>>>>> It´s up to you how to beat the level, if you want to go rambo with a minigun, go sneaky with your crysis-like nanotek invisibility suit and kill guys with your bullet-blocking katana, hack enemy turrets  and control them, summon  allied ghostsoldiers, use drones and remote turrets, sniping using infrared vision, bribe NPCs,......<<<<<WEAPONS>>>>>The weapon feel all pretty solid, there is a wide range to choose from. Every weapon has it´s requirements, but once you unlocked it with the in-game currency ""bonzoufs"", you can equip them for ""free"". Assault rifles don´t f**** around, they are single-shot at the distance, very accurate and can bring down the early-game enemys with 1-2 shots. Overall well balanced  <<<<<GADGES>>>>>    You can choose from Medipacks, Remote (""Half-Life"") turrets, flying drones, and Grenades.Many of these Items have to be researched before you can unlock them at your HQ`s. The best thing is that besides your limited inventory space(""System Shock""), there is no limit how many of what things you equip. So if you are a Rambo style player, you might want to get a nice Assault Rifle, double pistols and fill the remaining ""backpackspace"" with mags.  Items do not cost something to equip, they only have to be unlocked, which gives you a lot of freedom since you don´t depend on money                                        <<<<<STORY>>>>> The Story is very confusing. There are no intro video sequences, you have to figure it out by yourself by either reading 30+ pages of written stuff in your HQ´s libary or search online for a fanmade story intro;). The story is poorly told, but not bad at all. Depending on your choices, there are different endings. (No ""Mass Effect endings"")The replayability is very high, you can go on side missions, and if you roam around in the levels, there are may people to meet, things to do, equipment to get.... Almost every guy in the game has a quest for you, it´s up to you if you accept it and how you beat it.Also, there are many strange things to discover in this weird world;)   My rating: 8/10, pick it up while on sale, not everybody likes the game;) And please don´t go in and be like ""oh, there are soldiers shooting at me. F*** what is he throwing at me? DAAAAMN I got killed.... *uninstall* Give it it´s time! You didn´t explore the van Braun/Majestic 12 HQ´s in one day, did you?PS: read the beginner guides in the forum and play the demo (read them before playing the demo;)[If you think I have not mentioned important facts/ have suggestions to edit the review, please comment] -carrot/eM			",96,3,2,2,4,0,15

												This game is awesome. I'll give a pro/con listPros:- awesome gunplay- beautiful area design and aesthetic- many different ways to develop your character- large and open mapsCons:- lacks close quarters maps. most maps are very open, and it means that cqc situations like in half life are pretty rare- the rpg systems lack punch. you can't REALLY tell the difference between a character with 50 accuracy and a character with 80 accuracy All in all I'd recommend it. It's pretty cheap, and it's got a lot of replay value			",100,5,0,9,6,0,10

												In my highschool P.E. class we would go to the local bowling alley sometimes. We would take the school's bus and my friend would always sit in the same exact seat. The seats were made of foam and covered in a fake-leather material. My friend would always poke at a tear on the seat in front of him, but I initially thought nothing of it. This is important.The bowling alley had a food court near the entrance with a bunch of packets of condiments. My friend would always grab a handfull or two of them and stuff them into his pockets on the way out. One day back on the bus I noticed my friend poking at the hole on the seat again, and he started emptying into it  the contents of the mayonaise and ketchup packets he took from the bowling alley.I asked him what he was doing and he only said, ""It's the sauce hole.""Also E.Y.E. is pretty good.

												This thing is completely strange. It's a source engine shooter that has an ""A"" typical dystopian cyberpunk setting blended with Warhammer 40K with a bit of French-sounding VO. You are given a smorgasbord of powerful weapon options from the get go in the tutorial. There are a multitude of separate character upgrade paths that are impenetrable without some research (including research as one of the paths). Missions are semi-labyrinthian style maps with re-spawning enemies. Some are huge. You can alter the difficulty AI, and respawn rates in the options on the fly at any time. There is no manual save...auto save by way of a character profile. You can take your character online, offline, coop, and in-between independent from the single player campaign. There's a hacking mini-game with 4 different starting options and an additional layer of 5 options during the hack. There's over a dozen Cybernetic upgrades and implants and PSI powers (like Magic) on top of all that. It is a bit overwhelming with so many options. The game isn't without its host of problems but suffice is the say I love games that confuse me and challenge the norm. Recommended if you want something woefully different.			",244,55,3,42,17,1,67

												I'll be frank...this game has a lot of potential. Its only real draw to me is it's like Deus Ex... if Deus Ex was a horribly translated, pretty shotty source mod and hadn't been funded by some pretty large companies at the time. That being said, what there is to the game is fun. E.Y.E. boasts nice multiplayer, interesting leveling systems, a cool crafting system but is plagued with issues like limited enemies and the quickly dying out source engine. As much as source has brought us joy and happiness, it just isn't modern game material, even back in 2011.With all of those factors in place, the enemies can be ridiculously easy, often running around randomly into tactically horrid spots. The hacking in the game is another game to its self, like a small RPG that is played in a minute or so. The Tutorials are also extremely lengthy, have no sound, and because of the communication gap caused by the games horrible translation, hard to follow. The story is told to you through your collegues and mentors since you for some reason have amnesia, which is one drawn out story mechanic this game could have done without. Overall the game is a fun tech demo, if source wasn't already out for almost a decade, I would have been wow'd by this. It's a good buy if you can get it for $5 or less, but definitely isn't worth the $10 price tag.			",397,48,3,36,31,2,39

												Shooting mechanics are plain. Graphics are poor, but the art style makes up for it for me. It's great. Story and translations are nigh-on incomprehensible. Sound is mostly Half Life 2. I can't even remember the soundtrack.But you know what? It's pretty amazingly original. The constant effect of YOU CAN DO THAT? is so cool. Absolutely worth playing, at least to see all the things they could come up with. If this game had the AAA treatment, it would be GotY, but if it did, it wouldn't exist.			",114,19,0,12,4,0,11

												E.Y.E is not a game for the light-hearted, but can easily be fun when you have a solid grip on it's mechanics. If you're just starting out, you'll notice there is a fairly large and extensive RPG element despite this being an Action/FPS title. Do not be overwhelmed! This game is simply trying newer things and mixing up the genre a bit. You can use money you've gained to research new weapons, better abilities, and better cybernetic implants. Your character slowly becomes this god-like being whether you just want to run'n'gun or be more ninja like. Either way, what's infront of you usually dies. A very ambitious title.Not to mention that there are branching story archs.The artwork and design is a well blended cluster of Warhammer meeting Cyber-Punk. The weapons feel heavy and powerful. The cities have smog and droopy colors. Everything comes together really giving the world this depressing ""hell was already here"" look. Sadly, the Source engine begins to show it's age. That didn't stop the great map development or modelers though. Bugs tend to still pop up and physics can go haywire, but that has not stopped me from enjoying 200+ hours of entertainment. I bought this years ago and still enjoy it. Even if it isn't on sale, I would recommend this game. I can only pray for a solid sequel. I even see this on sale for $1 USD every now and again. Don't let the price tag fool you. It's way beyond a bargain (if you're willing to let go of what you already knew about the FPS genre).Get it.Love it. ",268,24,2,28,10,1,26

This review presumes you already read other stuff about this game.""Heavy is good, heavy is reliable. If it doesn't work, hit them with it""And oh, how heavy is this game.Fristly, i'd like to say that i watched an entire PT on this game before buying it. Don't take my 8 hours of GP seriously.The essencial about this game is covered pretty much everywhere, i won't go over it again. I'd like to add, however, that calling it ""batshit crazy"", ""old tech"", ""flawed gem"", ""a mix of deus ex,warhammer 40k"" or whatever is to sell this game short. I will discuss about how this game plays and then about how it feels.The gameplay itself is quite simple. It is heavy and reliable. No fancy cutscenes, no quick time events, no nothing. mechanically wise you can buy this game for its face value, there is nothing hidden here. Or at least not in the game itself. You see, this is very true to the 90's fps in this sense. Wanna take cover? you have to actually move yourself behind the wall. Wanna dodge something? good luck with WASD keys. Wanna hit a moving target? (oh they move fast) Gotta train it for good, and the game gives you all the time in the world... for training at least. This game requires some very raw skills kinda forgotten since modern FPS style. If you are 25 YO or older, you already know where i am going with this, if you are younger, this could be a very intresting experience.Some say this game is not an fps, but an RPG with fps elements. Maybe, maybe not. For all i care this is irrelevant. What matters is that you will end up shooting sooner or later. And shooting here is so tight that i could lick my guns to polish it with a blanket after each mission. It feels so damn good! i had actually grown emotionally attached to the guns i use often, hell, i might even start giving them names. The AI has an attention span of a golden fish, true... they are♥♥♥♥♥♥ But somehow this doesn't bother me. It actually makes the game play nice. About how it feels: heavy, solid, yet... oniric.It is very half-life ish when we talk about feelings here. You know, that brutal immersion those games offered us. The way you interact with the world helps a lot in this sense, but there is something more about it. The level design, the neo-noir main approach and the art style walk the lore talk, it feels coherent. You feel a growing confusion about what is happening, you feel so... alone. This provides a most unique immersion for the player, and if you are a social freak like me, you will end up addicted to it very quickly and very strangely. This feeling when you are sneaking around to find some advantage and you spot an enemy. ""oh, so this is where you stand... now- where are you going?"". This game gives you all the time in the world, and it feels... yeah, it surely feels. In some aspects, this is better here than in, let's say, DE:HR or even than MD, being slightly pushed back by the forseeable AI.Tl;DR: If you are a millenial or older, this neo-noir Diesel punkish looking game feels strangely familiar, and it just might warm your heart with it's cold dark atmosphere.ps: don't try to make sense out of the main plot. There is none to be found.			",22,3,0,15,7,1,8

												Confusing and broken but still a stand-out FPS in too many ways to express to someone who hasn't played it yet.  It's not balanced, it doesn't need to be.  It's not well translated, it doesn't need to be.  It doesn't make sense.  It doesn't need to.

												I am so happy that I came across this game. It literally personifies everything I love about action-adventure RPG's. A perfect hybrid of modern shooters with an inventory development system, point distribution and augmentation / booster system as a in-game mechanic for maxing one's toon. Using a punishment system where even the most fatal of deaths can make a perma-dip in hardstat, this game forces the player into researching and mastering skills and cybernetics to become a literal God. A glorious hub world, endless skirmish content, a story driven expirience with a dash of sword and board / shootem-up gives me the desire to log back in something serious, sometime soon.Using the source engine, supporting multiplayer porting and massive explorations Id recommend this game to everyone. Badge and achievement progression for the farmer in all of us. Play this game, and begin the spiral decent into madness when we ask ourselves ""When is modifications going to far?""Not bad on the eyes for the date released, and OMG the replayability. So good.

												It's fair to say I love this game. It's a true gem, a diamond in the rough. When I first tried to play it, I couldn't get into it at all. I got my legs broken, I gained no brouzoufs, I couldn't do diddly squat. I abandoned it, thinking it was an awful game.But then I returned, spurred on by people saying that actually, it's a pretty good game. And this time when I played it, I found they were absolutely right. EYE is an acquired taste. A buggy and broken mess of a game that does enough things right to make up for its plethora of problems. A game with a plot so ridiculous yet fascinating when you get invested, with characters that can come back to life as the plot demands. EYE should not be nearly as good as it is.If you've never touched this game before, or you've tried to and hated it, try finding yourself a nice guide on character creation and abilities. Before long, you will become a walking tank with electronic warfare capabilities, invisbility screens, psychic powers, and carrying miniguns, small nuclear cannons, or a revolver that can kill God. If you put in the effort, if you put in the time, if you manage to invest yourself in EYE, you'll be in for a wonderful experience that you can't quite find anywhere else. Buy it, Play it, Gain Brouzoufs, and make sure your legs are OK.			",83,7,0,16,6,1,1

												You’re a full-on medieval knight (like on a ♥♥♥♥ing horse medieval, like ye olde english medieval) who is a member of, I guess you call it a cult, which is operating in Blade Runner/Neotokyo setting. This cult is run by, get this, ♥♥♥♥ing space marines from Warhammer. To be precise by two space marines from Warhammer who are constantly at each others throats. The cult itself is at war with CYBER CHINESE WHO ARE PART OF THE SAME ♥♥♥♥ING CULT. The cult is also at war with the government and the government is at war with ♥♥♥♥ing everyone.It gets better. The starting location is uh I think it’s your dead cyber-brain which is pierced by ♥♥♥♥huge katanas and the dead bodies of the two key space marines are there too. There’s also a cyber chinese dude who is I think an intentional reference to Morrowind’s Jiub. The chinese dude appears there only when you die. Death mechanics are really interesting, basically you can be resurrected by your implant called Resurrector but the number of resurrections is FINITE, when you die for real you get back to the katanas and♥♥♥♥♥♥in the DREAM.But wait there’s more. The first tutorial starts in PLATO’S CAVE. Yep. I guess this is the only time my philosophy class came in handy. All those sleepless fresman nights, the professor had us manually copying all of Plato’s works in the notebooks for a whole ♥♥♥♥ing year. There are shadows and I guess what passes for prisoners and I guess you get the knowledge of the true reality right from the start but… I don’t even ♥♥♥♥ing know man.There’s also Captain Dutch, who is the only character who’s not a huge♥♥♥♥♥♥to me in this game. I mean those space marines are ♥♥♥♥ing insufferable.IT WILL BLOW YOUR MIND			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I particularly enjoyed this game more than most others for the simple fact that its a montage of all sorts of things without having to be a strenuous game for peoples computers. Theirs nothing like being a level 130 with max everything, playing multiplayer, sprinting so hard you break your legs, while holding a fork lift in your hands. I mean, who doesn't love crushing their enemies with a fork lift? After a certain point, people will begin to realize, they cant pick up that fork lift because they're too weak. So instead, they'll find a way to get it off the map. Theirs pleanty of sandbox DM. Lots of laughs to be had, and lots of fist slamming on the desk. I recommend this game even though its pretty much on its last legs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												EYE is probably my favorite game of all time, but it isn't really a game I'd describe as something one plays for the game's story, or even for the gameplay. One plays EYE for the stories about the game. That being said, the gameplay's pretty good too, if you like Source engine shooters.I was killed by being hacked by a door I attempted to hack. The first time I ever fired the Excidium, I got the achievement for killing yourself with the Excidium. It's possible to make everyone in the hub area hostile to you by jumping on someone's head while there. I found out the hard way that you can kill yourself by controlling an enemy you've hacked and possessed to a position where it can shoot you. I've cleared a mission just by carrying a defense turret around in front of me. It's possible, and easy, to kill the insects and rodents and walrus-creatures scurrying around on the floor, but you'll lose karma.You can get a PSI power that kills whatever you hit with it, but it also gives you brain damage.The plural of Brouzouf is Brouzoufs, except when the plural of Brouzouf is Brouzouf.There's a sword that makes enemies explode. Or does the sword itself explode upon contact with enemies?Or, the above in condensed form, for EYE veterans:You gain BrouzoufYou gain BrouzoufMy legs are OKYou gain BrouzoufAuditive Hallu...You gain Brouzouf			",75,6,0,10,3,0,1

												Holy crap this game, this game holy crap.One of the most fun games I've ever played. Single Player is HARD but fun... Co-Op is a whole new ballpark.This game has anything you could ask for in the realms of FPS/RPG. Co-Op Campaign over LAN or Internet and randomized quests.... I really don't even know where to begin. E.Y.E may be a little bit overwhelming at first with all the dozens of different stats/skills/""spells""/classes and weapon combinations but once you get the hang of it, you're in for a real treat.I was gifted this game and didn't play it for over a week... The moment I started playing, I didn't stop for two full days. I'm writing this review under complete mental exhaustion, the addiction of this game had me playing until I beat it completely twice in a row.If you like RPGs or FPSs, I can almost completely promise you that you'll be enthralled with E.Y.E.It may not have randomized maps but everytime you enter a map, there is a plethora of randomized quests with all kinds of nifty enemies and game mechanics that require quick thinking and skill.The story is super confusing but you'll understand it after the second or third play-through... Or just do what I did at first... ""yes, yes, yes, yes, yes"" and then go kill whatever the computer throws at you.HOWEVER, this game is SUPER indepth and every single choice you make with the NPC's will alter the entire game; so if you care about story, I suggest at least brisking through the dialogues when prompted.9/10The only thing that saddens me about this game is the fact that there is no mod support and never will be... Sure,  you can create your own maps and even campaigns but there is no easy way of doing so.Seriously, another must-have. Get it now. I wish I could go back in time and shake myself for not discovering this game much sooner.			",122,31,0,32,32,1,21

												Glitchy, buggy, but I still like it.I don't love it, but I do highly enjoy it.\One thing that PARTICULARLY bothers me is that the Malstruem (Malstrom? Malstrum? whatever they are called. I can't remember anymore, it's been a while) always come for me, wherever I am, unless I am cloaked. They don't search, they just follow the shortest path to me, even when they can't see me. As soon as I cloak they leave to pursue another target, and as soon as I uncloak, even as they walk out the door all the way across the warhouse, they turn right back around to chase me.It does make it somewhat difficult to play at certain parts, but mostly it's just REALLY annoying.I'm not very good at hacking with the one character I've made, so that means that, well I can't hack stuff so easy. That it is good. I wish I could hack better though, for that experience, so I have to make a new character or get better.I kind of wish that there were more items to buy in the store, maybe customize the armor some more or customize the guns.It's still fun, expecially if you can laugh when a game works weird or bugs up and still legitimately enjoy it.

 TL:DR at the end, scored 5 / 10 as of 26th April 2015 Borba likes:Genre - First Person Shooter melded with RPG elements that seems inspired by Deus Ex, System Shock and a hint of X-Com, carrying a great deal of depth through stats, abilities, research and bodypart upgrades.Replayability - Open ended gameplay with replayable levels holding different missions and objectives. The story also has a few different endings and meaningful choices. Cooperative and competitive multiplayer also add to the longevity of the title. Also, achievements.Gameplay - Melee combat and shooting make up for most of the game, and are enjoyable once the character becomes stronger and the player figures a build that suits his playstyle. Blocking bullets with swords, dual-wielding, rapid movement and stealth are few of the many possibilities.Music - Music blends in nicely without being distracting.Sound - The sound effects are decent, just not extraordinary.Borba dislikes:Design - A frustrating early game experience due to lack of a better tutorial makes out for a terrible learning curve, relying on community guides and / or patience. Poor level design, with several maze-like levels that offer little in terms of navigation other than a waypoint without trail. Grindy at times, mostly because almost every mission throws dozens of enemies at the player, and keeps spawning them over and over, which feels like a cheap way to keep the player busy while chugging along the overly large and often confusing levels.Graphics - Cyberpunk with a touch of the occult, spoiled by Washed out textures that contrast with the better looking character models.Interface - Non-intuitive interface that will require time and effort to get used to, but will never feel right.Narrative - Poor writing and dialogues, sometimes even confusing, which is a shame since the game is pretty heavy on text. At times I had the feeling two completely different writters got their works mixed up.Polish - Bugs and lack of polish, such has having enemies spawn on top of you from a fixed spawn point, ability shortcuts not working and not knowing what researched entries provide until they are researched.Borba feels like the game can be either loved or hated, providing high value and replayability only to those who can dismiss its raw state and shortcomings. He didn't enjoy it too much though,playing through it fueled by little more than a spark of curiosity felt more of a chore than anything, and for this reason he can't recommend the game.5/10 ",1232,348,31,186,139,5,190

												One of the best games I've ever bought.  E.Y.E. is rough around the edges, no doubt, but if you can look beyond its sometimes laggy multiplayer and occasionally sketchy english translations it holds some serious entertainment value, as well as a good story.  Although the storyline is pretty incomprehensible at first (ok, for the first 3 or 4 playthroughs most likely) there is a deeper meaning to it than meets the eye, even after completing all the endings.  The single player gameplay is fairly confusing at first, but there's several guides on the steam community that should help get you set up.  EYE claims to be a mix of RPG and FPS elements, and that it is, with a character creation and leveling system that's not unlike that of an RPG, and solid FPS gameplay on top of that.  The level design as well is very good, and personally I find that EYE has an atmosphere that very few games can pull off successfully.  On the multiplayer end, the game comes with four game modes:  Co-op Campaign, Co-op Missions, Battle Royal, and Team Artifact.  The two Co-op types are pretty straightforward, Campaign is the game's campaign mode with multiple players, and Missions is non-story missions set in the story maps that are fun to run through and good for gaining additional Brouzouf.  Team Artifact is a team-based PVP mode.  The goal of the mode is to take the artifact to the enemy's base, and score a touchdown.  Battle Royal is essentially an elimination PVP mode with random weapons, armor, and health.  Unlike Team Artifact, which plays best with at least 3v3, Battle Royal works well with any amount of players.  The server runs on SRCDS, and setting up a dedicated server if you are so inclined is a cinch, provided you know how to port forward.  Setting up in-game temporary servers is similarly simple, although again port forwarding is required to have your server visible over the internet.  Even if you don't want to pay $10 for EYE at full price, it often goes on steep discounts during steam sales, so if you're patient you can pick it up for $5 or even less.  EYE is well worth the price, and if you can convince a few friends to pick it up along with you, you'll find a great Co-op and PVP experience waiting for you.			",114,10,8,9,7,1,8

												Hoo boy. This is why I love independent games. Not going to lie. This game is rough. It has issues. But you know what? It's easy to overlook because of how ambitious it is. In this game you play an agent in a shadowy organization dedicated to fighting... you know what? I don't even know what the plot is. There's infighting in the organization. It's distracting from your true purpose of combating a corrupting force. There is background text that hints at a complex setting, though it doesn't have much impact on what you will experience in the assorted missions.The plot itself is a complete head trip. And the ending gets really meta. In terms of game play, it's a first person shooter. You get money and in between missions you can unlock items. You have a number of inventory slots on your person you can place those items in.  You gain experience, and levels, which you can use to improve skills. You also can purchase cybernetic implants and psionic abilities. There's a lot of ways you can pull your character. But you probably want to decide exactly what they are ahead of time because it doesn't pay to generalize.There are a number of glitches and exploits in the game. And it can be a bit of a grind. Very much a wiki game. Has a cooperative multiplayer mode, and you retain your progress in both.			",237,55,3,53,27,1,58

												This is the most begrudging recommendation I've ever given. Gameplay will make absolutely no sense at first. For example, enemies respawn on a timer and will appear literally just after a blind corner. Thus, there will never be an ""all-clear"", and thus you will find hacking to be a non-option without literal invisibility because most areas have zero hiding spots from the all-seeing armed thugs. If you can handle the repeated trial-and-error, the confusing text, and the dead ends of research (there's research that takes ten minutes to do IRL and costs resources but gives you nothing, you'll only find out which if you check the wiki or waste your time researching them) (and on that matter, research sometimes requires items  that are dropped by random mooks in a black case that blends in with their environment. Seriously?), EVENTUALLY you will find a game that is fun with satisfying weaponry and, near the end, wonderful and powerful skills. Most importantly, you can get one that kills and enemy and teleports you straight onto them so you can murder and teabag in one fell swoop.But there's just so many bad aspects to the game. I can't say it should be bought for full price. Especially not on Steam where  much better games can be bought for less than ten bucks. I guess I can say it's worth it if you have plenty of spare time and don't know what to do with three bucks this holiday.			",88,13,0,13,11,2,8

												This game definitely has some potential but it's not fleshed out enough.I didn't care about the story or anything and the tutorial system, and overall quest system is not that good. The gameplay is good though, there's definitely some really good assets in there. The game looks pretty good and it has an interesting art style. I'll keep an eye out for the developer in the future for sure.The game just needed some more development time in my opinion. But it ends up being just a real shallow experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To be technical, it's an FPSRPG with all the usual flair of stats and cybernetic upgrades, inventory etc.Apart from that it's probably the weirdest game I've played in a while. It doesn't seem to follow any of the usual rules of modern game design and ends up feeling very fresh because of it. But the weirdness is almost certainly going to cause the lowest common denominator hate it because, well, it's not easily accessible.The setting is, as someone put it, a mix of Deus Ex, Warhammer 40k, Stalker and a whole slew of 1980's scifi films. Some of the maps would not look at all out of place in a Blade Runner game, for example.Given how cheap the game is, especially when on sale, I just have to recommend it. Even if you are disappointed, you won't be down too many bucks for it, and I can pretty much guarantee that you've not played anything quite like it before.			",90,18,0,9,14,0,20

												A strange mix of Deus Ex and Serious Sam. Not only is it aesthetically influenced by films such as Ghost in the Shell, Blade Runner and Alien, but it is influenced sonically too. The soundtrack by Oliver Zucarro provides an amazingly atmospheric backdrop to the game's crazy action and large maps. Highly recommended to all shooter and RPG fans who don't mind something a little rough around the edges, or hard to understand.			",117,13,3,17,3,0,24

												I played the demo and was immediately hooked. Bought the full game and, even though I'm only a few hours in, I already love it. I do advise you download a text mod that better translates and otherwise explains aspects of the gameplay mechanics and story, but regardless this game has a bit of a learning curve.Let's get one thing out of the way - this is a shooter first, with RPG elements. The general combat is pretty straightforward. The weapons are fairly point and shoot, but are affected by stance and the Accuracy stat. I haven't tried melee combat much since I'm more of the marksman type, but the swords do hack off limbs nicely. :D The nuance comes from the cyber and psi powers as well as the hacking, which are all governed by a surprisingly expansive stat system. Level ups occurr fairly often (my advice - use a sniper rifle and go for headshots as much as possible, lots of XP!), and there are a variety of skills to upgrade, in addition to new abilities to buy and upgrade, as well research projects to undergo which yield new items and stat bonuses. Point is, this system is much more fun to play with and certainly more fleshed out than other Role-Playing Shooters. It's closer to Deus Ex 1 than it is to, say, Mass Effect 2.Beyond the game mechanics themselves though, I find myself drawn in to the world. The mix of Templar-ish Culters with the Oriental/Samurai-like Jin factions of the player's organization is really cool, and contributes to a multicultural feeling that extends to the streets of the game's world, which itself is patrolled by ragtag-looking looters and the glowy-eyed stormtroopers of the Federation. As far as rundown, gloomy cyberpunk worlds go, E.Y.E. has it down pat.I highly encourage you to pony up the meager fee to check out this little gem. It has its flaws to be sure; understanding the world and history requires lots of front-loaded reading in the Temple archives, the A.I. isn't the best and you may want to remap some of the default controls, but in a sea of Source shooters, this 12-man effort stands above as one of the best. E.Y.E. Divine Cybermancy restores my faith that there are still people out there who appreciate a good single player RPG.			",168,8,0,7,3,1,2

												This game is an interesting one, but it also suffers in some ways.The general design aesthetic of the game is possibly the most compelling feature. Imagine Warhammer 40,000, but with more of an pseudo-oriental theme. In it; katanas, large suits of armour and mystical powers. While these are interesting, sadly, the game suffers in gameplay. It is based on Valve's Source engine, and so, like familiar games such as Counter Strike, the shooting system is very good. The guns are all *fairly* unique, and that is all well and good. However, the fighting is very boring. You basically fight waves of highly unintelligent A.I. which more-or-less throw themselves at you for a long time, chewing up your ammunition in a way that feels like it is being put to waste.I read some other reviews about this game which, to paraphrase, said the game put the player head-first into the deep end. Both in the story, and the class/leveling system, implying, or outright accusing the game of being convoluted and unfriendly to new players. In my opinion, these are nothing but excuses for laziness. I'll talk about the class system, since I don't feel like regurgitating the story (also, since I haven't finished it). The class system is sort of 'dynamic' in that it assesses the way you have attributed  skill points to your character, and then 'labels' it. You gain experience, and upgrade stats. The game also earns you 'Brozoufs' (money), with which to buy special upgrades. Everything is written down. If you don't know what something does, then you more than likely did not read its description. Moreover, if you still feel as though there is too much confusion, the game includes 20+ tutorial videos, and there exist game guides for stuck players. If, dspite this, you still need to complain about the difficulty of the game, then regrettably, you are only asking to be spoonfed.The graphics are pretty dated-looking as well (as a result of its being based on Source Engine, no doubt), and this gives the game an 'outdated sci-fi' appearance, and that's sort of unappealing. But you know, it isn't the end of the world.So, to summarise, the game is quite mediocre in important ways. It is an inexpensive game. If you feel the need to try something mildly original in concept, then I would recommend it, but do not expect something groundbreaking.			",139,11,1,13,15,0,14

												My god, do I have mixed feelings about this game.  It clearly ran out of money half way through its development and it has some unbelievably annoying glitches all throughout.  (I also have some problems with certain parts of the story, but in the interest of not giving spoilers to a very story intensive game I won't bring them up here.)  Still, for as annoying as this games flaws can get, they are completely outshown by the amazing, deep experience this game provides.  With the single best Cyberpunk world I've ever heard of, a fascinating (if flawed) story, and the best gameplay in a serious shooter I've ever experienced, I can only recommend this game to shooter fans and RPG fans alike.  (Oh, did I mention they have a really fun and (mostly) balanced character specialization and weapons system?  'Cause that's really important.)  I think my friend put it best; this game does ""tacticool"" flawlessly.  Be warned; it's very challenging and it does glitch on occasion.  That said, this is one of the best games I've ever played and one of my favorite of all time.			",46,4,0,5,4,1,9

												EYE is a source engine game, meaning you'll find the playstyle reminicent to that of Half Life, Left for Dead, etc. But that's just the tip of the iceberg as far as gameplay goes because on top of being a FPS, this game also has RPG elements. You have stats that benefit your melee damage, accuracy, hacking, run speed, Psychic powers, and so on. On top of that you can spend ludicrous amounts of money to get cyber body modifications or to preform research on artifacts which will boost your stats even higher. At a certain point you will be able to run at ridiculous speeds, turn your foes into a fine red mist with a cybernetic claymore, and backstab helicopters with warhammers.However there are a few places where it, debatibaly, falls short. There are a lot of bugs in the game, not including the ones that you can shoot. Even with an extensive ingame tutorial a lot of gameplay mechanics are somewhat unclear. Every character in the game talks and swears like a grizzled bandit, from actual grizzled bandits to your fellow psychic space illuminati assassin paladins. A karma and rating system that 'somehow' are intregal to gameplay probably. Getting shot in the face so hard that it breaks your legs, you get the idea.The story is an absolute trip, even if you do get the final ending there's a lot that you probably wont grasp. With elements such as alternate/nonexistant timelines, internal conflict in past-present tense, and the psychic force of the universe lashing out in the form of monstrosities in retaliation to rapid cyberascension and the squelching out of other species. I honestly have no idea what's going on and neither will you. Shut up and gain brozouf.			",129,7,0,16,2,1,11

It has its flaws to be sure; understanding the world and history requires lots of front-loaded reading in the Temple archives, the A.I. isn't the best and you may want to remap some of the default controls, but in a sea of Source shooters, this 12-man effort stands above as one of the best. E.Y.E. Divine Cybermancy restores my faith that there are still people out there who appreciate a good single player RPG.			",168,8,0,7,3,1,2

												A strange mix of Deus Ex and Serious Sam. Not only is it aesthetically influenced by films such as Ghost in the Shell, Blade Runner and Alien, but it is influenced sonically too. The soundtrack by Oliver Zucarro provides an amazingly atmospheric backdrop to the game's crazy action and large maps. Highly recommended to all shooter and RPG fans who don't mind something a little rough around the edges, or hard to understand.			",117,13,3,17,3,0,24

												What is E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy?Well that's the million dollar question, isn't it?I don't think it would be possible to fully describe this game in one go, nor would it do the experience that is EYE any kind of justice. Instead, here are a few vignettes and examples of the insanity in store for you.-As you may know by now, you don't create your character with anything as mundane as stat points or sliders. Instead you select three genetic modifiers from a pool of eight or so that randomly affect certain stats in certain ways. What do any of these stats actually do? Stop asking questions and resequence your Tipherath.- The second line of dialogue will you will encounter in the game is the line ""I know that I killed my mentor, and yet I am not his murderer."" Deep and introspective? Overly pretentious? Poor translation? No way to know for sure. This line essentially sets the dialogue's tone for the rest of the entire game.- You work for an organization called E.Y.E. (abbreviation unknown), which in turn works for an organization called the Secreta Secratorum, a secret society of secrets so secret that absolutely everyone in the game universe knows it exists. In addition, you belong to a subfaction of EYE known as the Culter Dei, which is in an internal war with the other subfaction, the Jiang Shai Di. The Jiangs dress up like post-apocalyptic cyber-samurai, while the culters all look like Space Marine Chaplains from Warhammer 40k. Aside from this, absolutely nothing is known about the two subfactions.- The time period the game takes place in is hard to describe beyond just ""Da Future"". It states that the current year is 15, but in another area it shows the date as Year 0.100. Apparently the year number reset sometime during the 2300's, but it also describes that in the game's history, humanity began using Psychic soldiers in 1890 and Psykers became part of the civilian public in 1970. Also, you happen to be trapped in a non-linear time loop, but you'll figure that out later.- The in-game currency is something called Brouzouf, or Brouzoufs (both instances are described as being plural). The strange thing is, unlike other games, this currency is never seen in physical form. There are no loose brouzouf that you can pick up off the ground, no ancient treasure caches of the stuff, no credit chits or loose bills. In addition to being rewarded with it from quests, you also magically gain it every time you kill something. You don't have to loot them, it just appears in your... bank account I guess?- There is a sword called the Damocles which causes anything it strikes to violently explode into little chunks, limbs, and a thick red mist. Why it does this is never explained, or at least if it is, I cannot find it. There is an achievement you can acquire with it by decapitating someone with it. Seeing as they essentially vaporize after you hit them with it, I am not sure exactly how you get it or how I even got it in the first place.- Sometimes you will kill homeless people, politicians, caring fathers, or soccer players. You never know when this is going to happen, but it will, and there really isn't anything you can do about it.- When you hack something and fail, there is a chance that you will be counter-hacked. Either your head will explode, killing you, or your HUD will be disabled and replaced with a laughing smiley face. If your HUD gets scrambled, you then have to hack yourself in order to cure it, which can also have lethal consequences. What kind of sinister machines can do this to you? Doors. Environmental controls. Ventilation systems. ATMs.- There is a sequence in which a bandit stops fighting you and spontaneously tells you his life story and how miserable he is. If you off-handedly remark that if you were him, you'd kill yourself, then he will drop the conversation, pause for a moment, and then casually stroll into a nearby mining laser. You will get an achievement for this.- ""My legs are okay."" Hell, I was crippled? I didn't even notice. Wait, but being crippled is also a lethal wound. So I was crippled, but I wasn't crippled?All that and much more. EYE is not a game, it is an experience, and love it or hate it, there's nothing else quite like it. The funny thing is, for all its strangeness, the gameplay is solid and the RPG elements mix with the FPS elements better than in almost any other game I have ever played. The guns have serious kick and you can hear the bullets ricochet off your armor. For a game made by only twelve people, EYE is nothing if not an accomplishment, even if its only accomplishment is being completely and utterly incomprehensible. And it's only ten bucks when its NOT on sale. E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy gets my recommendation.			",182,22,0,30,4,2,20

												A very surreal Cyberpunk game, everything is foreign and unexpected. The game is fun and has some really enjoyable RPG elements like researching new skills for you to use and strengthening specific body parts to get bonuses like increased gun accuracy for arms, faster run speed for legs etc.Only downsides would be that the story can get confusing and arguably the game not being that polished is bad although I think it adds to the charm of the game.

												Unique game, greatly deserving of a sequel. Quite dated by today, but it's so cheap & fun that it's still worth playing. Nonsensical story, but the wackiness of everything provides all the entertainment you need. Multiple different ways to play the game. Focus on melee combat, ranged gun combat, hacking & psychic powers & combat, or a mess of all of them together. You really feel like a giant super cyborg cultist soldier, where you can be so heavy in armor and metal body augmentations that simply stepping off of the sidewalk can cause the earth to shake.In my opinion, the game is a gem, maybe not a diamond of course, but a decent, unique gem. It's a shame it isn't super popular as the multiplayer is really cool too, with almost a sort of MMO-esque element to it. The best thing that could happen to this game would probably be either the community suddenly re-gaining popularity, or a sequel be made with modern textures and engine tweaks.

												It's not bad game, and I noticed on certain sales this game was like ~$1. It is worth much more than $1 for what it provides, with that being said it isn't perfect. It feels very much like an old school game, no hand holding, no checkpoints, you go through a level and you complete it in one ""go"". It has an ambigious and kind of meta storyline, which is fine, but this game feels...I don't know if this is the right word, but unpolished? If they made a sequel that was more polished it would be an amazing AAA game. I give props to the crew who made this game, I heard it was a very small group and given that fact it is a pretty solid game. As you level up, trying to get certain items, researches, tech and spells can get very grindy. Once you play through the game a few times it feels kind of short, especially when you learn the ""shortcuts"" in each mission where you can skip most objectives. If they made it so there were more twists and turns in dialogue and actions (not too much but some more), more variety in endings and missions, and put in more customizability to guns/spells/tech/hacking, it could be amazing. I hope they make a sequel, even if it is only a spiritual successor (seeing as...well you will know what the ending(s) are when you play it and understand why I say it would have to be a spiritual successor)			",209,25,2,23,14,2,49

												E.Y.E Divine Cybermancy is a unique first-person shooter game combined with role-play and stealth elements, the game is based on modified(?) Source engine, graphics are good and detailed, cyberpunk atmosphere is very well done as well.Mechanics may seem confusing, but its not complicated as it seems, the main story is something you have to experience on your own, its not really clear until almost the very end, where you get the general idea of what's really going on.If you want to play something unique then give this game a try especially if you like FPS/RPG/Stealth and cyberpunk.

												E.Y.E. is a hybrid RPG-FPS that tries to re-capture the feeling of Deus Ex using the Source engine and WH40k aesthetics. Does it work though? Partially. The stealth aspect is heavily nerfed in comparison to Deus Ex and most of the time you have to brute-force your way in, but still the game delivers what made Deus Ex good - freedom of approaching your objectives and battles. Add a layer of upgrades, customizability and good weapon selection and you have a rather solid gameplay. But E.Y.E. is not an easy game. It will take at least 2-3 failed attempts to understand how to play it properly. Even with the cheat sheets, it's very easy to misunderstand basic concepts and utilities role. The difficulty ramps up very quickly and by 3rd level it's very easy to get overwhelmed if you're inexeprienced. But once you master the system, the game delivers an amazing experience in terms of many builds you can use. The three main systems - guns, hacking and spells can be used seprately or merged and more often you'll find yourself trying to find a fun build that is in line with your playstyle rather than making a jack-of-all character.On the narrative side, E.Y.E.'s broken English and dialogue choices that range from a calm responses to psychotic threats of violence certain give the game a really weird flavour to it. Some of the messages you get in game ""You gain Brouzouf"", ""My legs are OK"" and ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T! Ultra-failed attack!"" have become loved by the E.Y.E. community to the point that no discussion is complete without copious amount of Brozouf, checking your legs and making sure your attacks are not Ultra-failed. There is a story hidden behind that facade of poorly translated writing, but it takes a little bit to get to it. It feels more like a forgein film than anything in that manner - it's rough around the edges but ultimately it's enjoyable after watching it twice.It's really hard to describe E.Y.E. - what started out as a clunky, buggy mess of a game with some patching and community turned into one of the ""Must-played"" cult games. E.Y.E. is an experience. A wonderful experience in the most psychodelic gaming trip you can ever imagine.I recommend it.			",278,79,5,29,31,4,58

												Freakily addictive for a game that's wierd as all hell. There's nothing to compare it to, because there's nothing that it's like.It looks Warhammer 40k-ish, but plays a lot closer to Deus Ex. The story is what you'd get if Tolstoi had just finished reading the Bourne series, if it was set in the Fallout universe, and he'd been mainlining LSD the whole way. I've played the game twice through, and I'm still trying to work out WTF is going on... but in a really good way... was I dreaming? Hallucinating? Jacked into the Matrix?! Also, WTH hasn't my character put his pistol in his mouth just to make it all stop, please, mommy!The graphics are pretty reasonable, but the sound can get a bit repetitive and the voice-acting is... well... none of it's in English, so I've got no idea whether it's ""good but intentionally odd"" or just badly done. My only real complaint is that very little is explained. Don't even bother with the tutorials, they're utterly useless. Your best bet is to work it out yourself with some online research to give you a boost.All in all, it's totally worth the price if you're looking for a fairly competent shooter with substantial RPG elements, and a massive dose of WTF that will leave you scratching your head for ages.

												Up is down, and down is up. Left is right and right is wrong, you dream while conscious and the wall between reality and daydreams becomes thinner and thinner with each passing hour. You think you know who you are, what you are, when you are and if you are, but you're wrong about all of that. Or are you? You're not very sure, because maybe you bought this game thinking it was just going to be Deus Ex with multiplayer. What you think might be a story is a distant fog you can't quite grasp, and treading through it only gets you lost. You don't know who you are, what you are, where you are, when you are or even if you are. All you know is that you're playing a game with fantastic gunplay, awesome psychic skills, multiple interesting possible playstyles, many long-term consequences and it just leaves you begging to come back for more. Not to mention the extra difficult levels to truly test your skill, and not to mention, potentially 32 person multiplayer. But this game is complex, and may not be for you. You may simply not be able to grasp it, but you have to try. This game is utterly fantastic. And for its price, absolutely worth it.			",37,9,0,5,1,0,3

As a wandering Space Illuminati Knight Samurai Magician Predator-alien with amnesia you find yourself questioning your role in the Space Illuminati and how the other faction of Space Illuminati Kung-Fu Samurai Sorcerer Ninjas intertwine with your destiny, as a man who writes his own destiny in the neon golden blood of the Space Illuminati temple he lives in, which he calls his soul.E.Y.E. Divine Cybermancy is a FPS/RPG most comparable to Deus Ex gameplay mixed with Source engine physics, Warhammer 40K aesthetics and a story that's meant to be as confusing as possible.The story revolves around power struggles. Between governments and rebel organizations, between different factions in the same organization, between members within the same faction, and ultimately power struggles within individuals. There are multiple endings and the player has a choice in what factions to side with or betray as well as how they want to accomplish the tasks they've been given. The gameplay is a mix between an FPS and an RPG. You have stats and classes but how well you can point a gun still determines whether you will hit or miss. Your stats affect everything from your ability to use weapons to how prone to hallucinations your character is. It's likely you will be overrun by the amount of stats the game throws at you. You character has weapon/item unlocks, armor types, robotic implants, research, cybernetic upgrades, stats, and semi-permanent debuffs to deal with. Because each of these affects other stats in one of 4 different ways. using a guide isn't a shameful thing in this game when it comes to understanding mechanics.One the FPS side of things it's pretty satisfying and in-depth too. There are keys to lean your character left/right, and they are used often. The guns are also satisfying, whether they're the default ones or higher tiered unlocks. Admittedly all of the guns are crazy accurate, even with a fairly low accuracy stat. Firing in bursts will keep most guns at a near sniper rifle accuracy due to this. Movement can be anywhere from ponderously slow to Arena FPS fast depending upon your equipment weight and your speed, with jump height ranging from a measly little hop to a 4 story leap. Psi powers are the only other thing to talk about and they keep with the weird over the top action by allowing you to literally make enemies explode into red mist before teleporting to their location or just letting a werewolf explode out of their chest and eat their friends.Overall, the game feels like a neon colored, futuristic Bruce Lee movie with robots, demons, robot-demons, afros, garbled English, confusing choose-your-own-adventure book plots ripe with betrayal, and werewolves. Considering it's often below the $5 mark how can you pass that up?			",264,34,5,42,17,0,38

												My personal favourite.That's what RPG should be in my opinion.It is an FPS RPG, really hard even if you play on normal (yeah, there is difficulty setting, but it is normal by default and you have to set it in options), you play as you want: you can be heavily armored assault fighter carrying a minigun and a good pistol, you can play marksman, sniping anything you can see, or go stealth... many ways of fighting, some fit for your current mission, some don't.I completed this game 9 times on normal to hardcore difficulties and I'm still unfinished, this game can't be completed for 100% achivements, but worth playing a lot.

												Disappointing. Imagine a stoned Russian telling you a story mixing up many of your favorite sci-fi tropes. Elements from Alien, Deus Ex, Stalker, Doom, Roadside Picnic, and Half-Life thrown in. Sounds great and weird, right? Sadly, it's not.The game consists of running through vast empty levels of dark brown and fog, instantly populated with waves of respawning enemies that will headshot you from across the map, or rain fiery death on you before you can turn around. And that's AFTER you crank both the difficulty and respawn rates down. Gameplay for every level is either ""run over here"", or ""run over here and kill mobs"". The game has many elements thrown in - there's 2 or 3 stat systems (all poorly explained, all seeming to do very little), half of a vendor system (you can buy but not sell), psychic powers, and hacking. Great ideas, but not executed well.The game is built on the aging Source engine. It runs more or less fine, it's just not worth it. I really wanted to like this one. Couldn't.			",105,26,0,23,6,0,10

												The best way to look at a game like EYE: Divine Cybermancy is through the lens of a person who has not played any other game. Ever. Why? Because it doesn't make any sense. The game deviates so much from the norm, that it would be impossible to compare it to any other game. It isn't really an FPS, nor an RPG, but it has some of both. The story is... satisfactory. It is one of the only games I've played where it hurt to follow the story, but this was only because of my previous experiences with games. Through a lens of a person who hasn't played a game before, the story is fantastic and deep. The rest is average. Playing with other people is semi-fun, servers are semi-populated, and the graphics are semi-good. My legs are okay.So why is this a positive review? Well, first and foremost, I had to change my perspective for it. Not many games made me do that, but EYE: Divine Cybermancy did. Not that it was a good shift, nor a bad shift, but it was a shift. Next, there was little room for buyer's remorse from my dislikes. I got it for only $0.99, cheaper than chips (about half as much where I live), so value wise, it is great.It is unpolished, has an overly complex story with little explanation, and most of the mechanics are left unexplained, but it wasn't BAD. In fact, it was an interesting game, that not only forced me to change the way I saw stories in games, but was a great value at the same time. For $9.99, the shift in perspective is not worth the price, but for $0.99, it very much is. 7/10			",124,10,3,9,18,1,7

												To say E.Y.E. is an excellent game would be a lie. It's an independant game, and it has it's flaws. The most noticable is it's badly trasnlated English, which makes the already confusing story even harder to initally understand. Aside from that, the other problem is some animation problems, making the characters move around in odd ways. Finally is the various glitches that come up during online play such as saves being corrupted and skipping levels entirely. Pass all of this, comes an expansive world full of exploration and deep lore that with ability to be expanded on even further. The gun play is exremely solid, and while some items are not great choices, most guns are and it makes for interesting and dynamic class specializations. The melee is fair enough, though there is something to be desired when playing a ninja-like monk. The PSI powers are satisfying to use and the way the games handles hacking is challenging but fun. The RPG-like skill points let you specialze  in things like PSI or gunplay or melee and make each new character unique. I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of RPGs, it's a unique experience that hasn't been matched by much other games.			",89,5,4,6,9,1,15

												Its great, its RPG elements are pretty deep, almost having a Fallout-ish feel to them. It has mechanics from Deus Ex, like its Cyber Tech and Hacking elements.  Another thing it takes from popular RPGs is its inventory system. You have a limited amount of space, so you cant just carry everything around.Character creation is not very big, it doesn't let you create the physical appearance of your character, but its not needed, because you never see his face. You choose 3 genes to splice together to make your character, each one having a positive and negative effects on your different stats.It has a speech system not unlike the AAA RPG franchises. It consists of choosing dialogue options and seeing what they have to say about it.  If you anger a character, he might get annoyed with you and tell you to shove off, or even attack the player.I haven't played it all that much, but with my time spent in Skyrim, Dragon Age, Mass Effect, and Fallout, I know i'm gonna love this game. I highly suggest checking it out.			",52,8,0,10,3,2,5

												E.Y.E. Divine Cybermancy is a defining achievement in the FPS/RPG hybrid genre. Congratulations to the developers at Streum On Studio for turning my indifference toward FPS games into an anticipatory itch for each new mission, city, and world to explore (and survive). This is the game that broke my faith in Metacritic.com (and the first game I just had to write a recommendation for). Its average metascore (60) and rumored learning curve warded me away at first, but the dark and futuristic world shown off in the trailers kept making me curious.Good thing I gave it a try. E.Y.E. Divine Cybermancy has earned more than just a spot on my short list of all-time favorite RPGs. It's also among my all-time favorite fictional universes, which includes books and movies as well as games. Don't just imagine what happens when the FPS and RPG genres have a baby. Imagine what would happen if Bladerunner, Equilibrium, Cyberpunk, Call of Cthulhu, and Warhammer 40,000 shared their DNA.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I has a wierd and unique atmosphere, the RPG elements dominate the game even though it is in the core a shooter and it is a good one too. In a way some gameplay mechanics are simmilar to Hellgate London, but this is a way much better game. The game is a bit hardcore too, you get killed really easy even trough the late mid-game. For the price it goes it's an awsome game. 8/10			",134,16,5,24,6,2,17

												You gain Brouzouf.E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy is a cyberpunk FPS/RPG/Thing where you play as a Warhammer esque cyber-man-soldier-ninja-samurai-sorcerer-guy who is tasked to save the entire universe from an otherworldly plague known as the ""I dont even ♥♥♥♥ing know"". In the game, a bunch of these similar cyber fellows give you quests that you'll have to solve by either killing everything that stands in your way or sneaking past them, except that the sneaking isn't actually even working so you'll just have to shoot everything. The game even gives you an option to disable enemy spawning so you wont actually even have to do anything, i'm pretty sure you'll even get an achievement for that. You also get granted with a hacking system which works a bit like rock/paper/scizzors on crack, it's really hard to explain but i wont even try to. Let's just say i've heard rumours of people getting killed by doors they have tried to hack.I seriously dont know how to write a review about this game, i've been trying to do so for a very long time but whenever i start doing it, it just ends up getting deleted. This probably happens becouse describing the game is extremely difficult, one could easily say it's a ""Deus Ex'ish game with 4-player coop"" but that's not really even close to what it actually is.One thing you probably notice is how the game suffers from the Human Revolution syndrome, meaning that everything is presented in an extremely orange/brown way. The game runs on Valve's source engine and as such looks pretty good, although it has some pretty clunky animations.So, i'll try and write it as objectively as possible and tell you what the game is like, i hope that gives you some info on whetever you want to make a purchase or not.A silly thing one might also notice is how the game gives you the regular bad guys to shoot at first but then all the sudden decides that you now need to kill demons and xenomorphs from other dimensions, it makes absolutely no sense but is pretty hilarious to look at.After writing this so called review i scrambled all the parts in it so it would make the least amount of sense possible, that's probably exactly what the developers of this game tried to do and since they succeeded so exceptionally well i think mimicing is suitable.So what makes E.Y.E so weird then? Well the dialogue is one such thing, one questgiver actually tells you that nothing makes any sense and that there isn't a point to anything, and that you dont even actually exist. Some of the other dialogue can just be people swearing a lot, it's really strange and doesn't fit the game whatsoever.So in the end, did i like the game? Yes, no? No. Yes, yes i did. It's a strange one, it has some really bad design decisions and flat out stupid stuff in it but is very entertaining nevertheless. Also the price they are asking for it during sales is so ridiculously low that you might as well just get it.			",707,83,10,93,25,5,85

												E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy puts you in a dystopian future where the all-controlling Federation is being overthrown by the Secreta Orginization. You play an agent of E.Y.E, a private army which fights for the Secreta, while fighting a civil war between themselves.The story is quite interesting and inspiring, but the dialogue isn't voiced, and when anything is spoken, it's spoken in a weird sims-gibberish language. However, character choices do affect the missions, such as choosing to shoot up a bar, or calmly speak with the owner. You can help your fellow E.Y.E agents, or choose to abandon them and do the mission solo. The world fits the tone of the story well, putting you in cities, slums, colonies, factories, other planets, and sewers. However, there aren't enough NPC's. The world feels empty, just you and bad guys. There are no civilians to avoid, no merchants hiding in corners to sell you a boost. Gameplay is very smooth, and has several tutorials in case you didn't understand some of the more advanced mechanics. One can build their character with a specific endgame in mind, or they can continue and simply put points into whatever they want, which makes progression very simple to manage. The inventory management is clunky, and simply hindering, limiting your full potential, but it could have been worse. Campaign missions are ridiculously long and easy, whereas secondary missions seem to be harder and shorter. Adjusting the difficulty on the secondary missions changed it into a fun and exiciting challenge. The general feel of the game is exhilarating, fighting monsters, looters, cops, and watching their bodies fall to the side, explode, or watch their limbs get sliced off. There hasn't been an end to the content, and even if I do reach level 50+, there are still more weapons to unlock and purchase. I haven't gotten all the cybertech upgrades, or psi powers, or finished all the research. This game simply never ends, you choose where to stop.Gameplay - 10/10Story - 7/10World/Environment - 9/10Overall - 9/10 I would definently reccomend buying this game and playing it with a few friends.I hope there will be an E.Y.E 2, I would back it on kickstarter if there would be! I am looking forward to seeing more games by Streum Studios as well.  ",168,25,1,16,20,1,22

												The very definition of Diamond in the Rough. This game delivers one of the most complete cyber-punk role playing experiences ever seen in a video game, complete with different endings, character specialization, inventory management, stats and a truckload of other things. The aesthetics are unmatched, and few games exploit the Source engine capabilities as thoroughly as this. Truly a must have for any hardcore RPG enthusiast.Word of advice, though: The game is hard, and it has tons of bugs. But nevermind those. This game is truly unique.			",335,25,9,23,12,3,37

 Positive + Akin to games such as System Shock 2, Deus Ex, and other FPS/RPG hybrids, E.Y.E.: Divine Cybermancy allows you to customise your character how you want, with a wide variety of cybernetic implants to choose from, and research to further power yourself up. Combined with solid gunplay (though the enemy AI may tend to idle around quite often and not get behind any sort of cover) makes the gameplay department quite enjoyable for the most part+ Utilising the Source Engine, the game may not excel in the graphical department, but it does manage to present a well-detailed environment, combining cyberpunk elements and a dark tone; topped off with great physics that complement the gameplay+ Adding onto the atmosphere, the music is certainly eerie and matches the quality of the visual aesthetic. This is probably one of the best aspects of the game. Negative - The biggest negative here is the games interface. Not only does it have a steep learning curve, but the supplied tutorials are lacking and don’t explain all of the necessary elements of the game very well. While I was able to get used to it in the end, there’s no denying that the interface makes it very hard to get immersed into the game due to how unintuitive and clunky it is- While the level design may be commended for being more open and spacious than the average linear FPS, the size of some of the levels actually ends up hurting the experience. Though I may have never gotten lost, it’s not very exciting travelling through the environments at a slow pace, combined with the fact that there is no real reward or gratification from exploring the empty levels; adding more secrets and hidden side quests would have made exploration much more appealing- One of the minor complaints of the RPG elements the game has is the fact that you will need to do a lot of grinding if you want to be able to buy/upgrade implants or weapons. You don’t need to upgrade or buy anything to beat the main story, but it’s unfortunate that you are required to grind for hours just to buy weapons that you may want to use, which means you’ll be stuck with the base equipment that you have in your starting armoury unless you go out of your way to grind for better ones- Lastly, the story is very poorly presented and convoluted; the dialogue especially is a pain to read through (which may unfortunately be due to poor translation). Though the game may have multiple endings, none of them feel complete or give a satisfying conclusion to the overall weak plot. The story barely strings together fully and feels like it’s tacked on rather than integrated well with the gameplay. The game is an okay length at 6 ½ hours (Normal difficulty), but there are only about 11 or so levels to progress through; however, playing the game in co-op could make the experience more fun. Verdict “A game marred by some visibly weak elements, E.Y.E.: Divine Cybermancy has both its high and low points. With a bit more polish, this game could’ve been truly amazing, but it sadly falls a little short. Though if you are looking for a good and cheap co-op FPS (and a decent single-player experience), this will certainly entertain you for a few hours.” 7/10 TJBs  ",336,61,9,32,4,1,8

												E.Y.E. is unlike anything you will ever play.Let me start out by saying this game is VERY confusing, even with tutorials you will still be lost. It took me quite awhile to understand the basics of the game. Any ailiments you encounter remember to press C, it is a life saver.The game is set in a futuristic cyberpunk world, with some very impressive levels, Great care and love was put into this games setting. Half of the time playing I would set there being in awe, the city levels in particular are gorgeous.The gameplay itself is where the game really shines, nothing is more satisfying than cutting an enemy with a sword only for them to explode into pieces. Any enemy you killed gains you brouzoufs, which can be used for different upgrades or can be used for research to increase your stats.One of my main gripe is the hacking part of the game, nothing about it was enjoyable which can lead to some frustrating encounters. If you failing hacking your character can be killed, so you have to watch your hp all the time. If you can look past some of it's problem, you've got a real hidden gem on your hands. There's no other game like this out there.			",303,52,3,24,13,3,12

												This game is definitely not the best mix of First Person Shooter and Role Playing Game out in this catalogue: The enemy AI is a bit too smart at times, making the game unnecessarily difficult, and you're gonna need to read a very extensive tutorial file in order to get any heads or tails of the interface and its intricacies. But if you manage to get beyond that, you will find a game that is ambitious, but knows what its doing. The story is non-linear, spiritual and at times a bit mindscrewy, with interesting dialogue and intriguing characters which you can't actually read with a mere shallow look, and the gameplay does the job well. If you like bleak, gritty cyberpunk games, give it a try, it will not disappoint you.			",361,116,4,82,34,2,80

												Intricate and ridiculous, EYE has earned every wise word spoken for it. It may also subvert every wise word spoken against it, even mine. EYE is not a success, and it is not always fun. On optimized systems you can expect protracted load times and glaring proofs of the Source engine's age. Much is amateurish; little thought seems to have gone into refreshing whatever was borrowed from Source assets (namely physics and other special effects. In EYE, your hand is the Gravity Gun). And you may be unimpressed by the character models, and sickened by the abrasive sound effects and voices, and the ugliest browns and greens you've ever seen.You will be tested. Here EYE hints that some of its flaws are not accidental, that they fit into a larger scheme. Perhaps you have played Pathologic, or STALKER, that other difficult game about acronyms. You have a suite of weapons with no clear utility and you will have to work for an hour to figure out which ones are useful. You have all sorts of abilities, but they are also spotty, and finding a way to even use them will take you at least one minute. You begin play with a rough idea that you can improve"" by spending resources on various things, some of them new weapons, some of them abstract representations of the things you can do. You may or may not figure out a plot; you may or may not sort out an efficient way to become better using one of two unexplained single-player game modes, or to become functionally better (as in more skilled) using the insane multi-player game mode. When a game puts up one kind of road block, who would I be to assume its other obstacles are accidental? I would have to be some kind of games journalist. I know that I am no kind of games journalist, because all deep questions recede as soon as I do the thing EYE most enthusiastically invites you to do: commit thoughtless virtual murder using a toolkit too large for my IRL kitchen. I blew up a man with a handgun called The Bear Killer today. I then hacked a computer in his friend's brain and compelled his friend to kill their remaining friends. I then summoned three psychic clones of myself to kill the confused survivor. Some mutants came, and I murdered them, too. EYE: Divine Cybermancy gives you all of these gifts, but it taxes you. Somehow, this feels thematic: when it is as easy as Hell to disappear a million mutant men with a single shotgun, the real antagonist might be getting *into* it in the first place. I sense deep genius, and complex fun. EYE makes you compromise for pleasure. When you ask why it might, you see that it wants you to think - but only for as long as it takes to reload.

												This was such an incredibly frustrating game. For every neat aspect that drew me in, there is another poorly designed or badly explained one to push me away. I played about 1 1/3 playthroughs (it seems that 3 playthroughs equals game completion). The first playthrough I did with a friend. I used a minigun, and my co-op partner used a sniper rifle. This combination was able to handle just about everything we saw on the normal difficulty, me taking out close to mid-ranged enemies and him mopping things up at long range. There was always plenty to shoot, as the game continually respawns enemies. Though I suppose some might find this a way to keep the game engaging and keep you on your toes, I just found it to be tedious and it made me feel somewhat ineffective. We liked the ability to hack and possess bots and enemies, though this system is somewhat poorly explained. Hacking was very time-consuming, and it never feels good to be harassed by the continually-respawning enemies while in the middle of a hacking battle. We wanted to use different weapons, but it never seemed clear exactly how to unlock some of them. The research system has quite a bit of potential, but it too just ending up being frustrating to me. You don't know exactly what researching something will give you (sometimes it actually gives you nothing at all), and you are only able to research things for which you've received the appropriate random briefcase drop. This makes it difficult to plan a ""build,"" and because the research can take a bit of time, you only can get so much done playing the game at a moderate pace. The ""Cybertech"" tree seems like another missed opportunity: it's difficult to figure out where exactly to spend your money, as you also are attempting to save up for weapons and research. Each point put in a ""Cybertech"" discipline is very expensive. Lastly, I have to comment on the simply absurd story. We couldn't figure out what was going on - the game was tonally inconsistent, and sometimes seemed cryptic for no particular reason.I attempted to begin another playthrough where I used resources online to plan my build: I wanted to use a little floating robot to help me fight (think ED-E from Fallout New Vegas). I planned my research to give me the strength I needed to buy the weapon at the weapon shop, and completed the ""Drone Forcefield"" and ""XSP345"" research to maximize the robot's effectiveness. I finally reached the prerequisites and bought him, only to find that I couldn't get him to fight with me. I went into the menu and clicked the button to summon him, I saw him briefly, and then he seemed to disappear. I looked for an option to give him orders. There was an option called ""Drone and Slave commands"" that was unbound in the keybindings. I bound a key to this option, and found that when I hit the key I heard a dull noise seemingly indicating that nothing was happening. So, I gave up on my ""build"" experiment and deleted the game.

												is the game worth getting? YES!!!!PROS decent story with some translation bugsgreat sound effects and musicgood combatvery replayabledifferent ways to playvery different from other shootersfunny (but could be considered poor) characterscan be fast pacedslighly customizable AICONSthe game doesnt teach you how to playvery complexcan be VERY overwhelminglow player populationanimation could be better and no ladder animation at allfew weapons and items to unlocksemi unbalanced playstyals (personally feel like its pretty spot on)no longer being developedthe game is not very nice to new players cause it is very complex and teaches you nothing. the game throws you to the wolfs and is confusing but know that this game is really good. you have the option of how you want to play for example you can be a stelthy assassin or a marksmen, you could be a hacker and use your foes to your advantage or maybe a lightning fast melee fighter or maybe a more tanky fighter if you prefer , would you like to use special powers? then try and make a mage type.no matter what you play this game is rewarding and granted it could be more polished but it it very well made and i feel this game if it were stil being developed could be better then any halo, COD or battlefield there is. you may want to do some research on the game to figure out some things or you could watch the video at the end of this post and it will explain everything in very good detail. NOTE:i didnt make this video ifound this video and used it as a guide.the game has a lot of flaws dont get me wrong but it has alot to show and i feel that this was very well made. i plan on making a thread and somehow getting the developers to come back.. (might be hard but i feel that strongly about this game)this video will explain more

												This game have a very unique atmosphere - very scary and mysterious. By the genre it's an FPS with RPG elements, but the thing I like the most about it - is how atmospheric enviroments and all around you is.Though this game not the easiest to understand (I still have no idea what's going on with it's plot), but I have to say - I strongly reccomend to at least try and play demo version to see if you like this type of gameplay. It's scary but without any jumpscares - the whole graphic and sound design is very appealing to me. Visually it borrows heavily from Giger's art for alien environments, and from Blade Runner for city ones - and it works great!E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy is very hard to compare to any other game.Warframe is apparently heavily inspired by this game Only Divine Cybermancy doesn't have a $hitty F2P aspect - you buy this game and you get full experience without the need to endlessly grind for resources.

												Уникальная игра! Она позволила взглянуть на киберпанк по другому, прочувствовать его. Признаюсь после темного киберпанка E.Y.E., в другие проекты той же направленности не шибко веришь. Действительно интересный сюжет, которые может отпугнуть на первой половине игры, но развязка первой концовки, заставила приоткрыть рот в изумлении. Но есть еще одна проблема связання с сюжетом, что бы понять всю исторю, вам придется последовательно пройти игру 4 раза!!! Да да, именно 4 раза, не у многих хватит терпения. Графически игра выполнена на движке соурса, не чего уж шибко великолепного, но дизайн локаций отличный. Саундтрек тоже вполне не плохой. Геймплейно игра немного странновата, на каждой локации, в которую мы поподем, практически всегда на нас будут переть толпы врагов, от которых придется постояно отстреливатся выполняя определенные задачи, не каждому такое по вкусу придет. Но есть такие уровни которые просто никогда не забудутся! Один из них - это уровень на военной базе с которой потеряна связь и, черт возьми, его атмосфера просто ложит на лопатки недавний Aliens Colonial Marine. Впринципе игра сугубо на любителя, для людей которые не боятся позновать что то новое. Всем другим, которые любят блокбастеры с крутейшей графикой, казуальщиной и одноклеточным геймплеем, не рекомендую приближатся на растояние пушечного выстрела!			",614,142,15,101,29,3,60

												Once in every generation a game defies classification, no matter how hard you try.E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy is a game you have not played before, it is as unique as it is flawed.Imagine if you will that you crossed an FPS, a resource strategy game and an RPG and wrapped it into the cyber-fantasy setting.  E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy is just that, a unique genre-blend that exceeds expectation in game design while unfortunately failing at presentation (spectacularly).E.Y.E Divine Cybermancy isn't a pretty game by an stretch of the imagination, its washed out low resolution textures, low polygon count, completely asinine UI, non-existant soundtrack, terrible voice-acting and translation will make many recoil in disgust. Yet, it succeeds where many other games do not by providing a gameplay experience so unique and well-crafted that all these flaws can be forgiven. The blend of cybernetic warfare, stealth, first-person shooting and resource management provide for untold hours of replayability. Add on top of that multiplayer co-op and the game becomes a fantastic title well worth your time.There is something incredibly visceral about running into battle, blocking bullets as they impact your swords, landing in a cloud of dust to unleash a power-attack at your helpless foes. Similarly, the same scenario can be played by hiding behind a wall and hacking the one of the troops, taking over his implants and making him shoot his own soldiers. Or perhaps, if you prefer the ranged alternative, unleashing a torrent of projectiles from your minigun while summoning the demons of hell with your psionic powers, warping the frail minds of your opponents as they collapse in their own excrement.E.Y.E Divine Cybermancy allows for all this, and more.The haunted atmosphere fits perfectly with its setting and while it might not be the prettiest of games, it certainly is consistent in art-direction. Everything you encounter will be gritty, run down and punk, yet also etheral and dream-like. The world is empty and hollow, and it fits the theme incredibly well. As your body suffers, your mind does as well and you should be prepared to deal with the consequences. Sanity is a rare commodity in this universe.E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy offers an experience like no other, it is gritty, it is creative, it is unforgiving, and you will love it.-------Read more video game news, reviews and editorials at gatheryourparty.com ",128,10,1,16,8,0,11

												Great and kind of unique cyberpunk game, mixture between FPS and cRPG genres on the Source engine. Great artwork (overally - models, textures, maps), atmosphere, interesting story and classic gameplay are big ""pro's"" of the game. Very fun and gives you at least few ways to complete your tasks (not mentioning you first create your own character, later on you buy upgrades for him like cyber-implants or access to new guns or new ""spells"" if you go the ""PSI"" way). The game includes campaign and single missions with randomized objective's and enemy, both of these can be played in the multiplayer (which is great for ""farming"" \ ""grinding""). Limited, but classy gore and one of the best guns ever found in a video game.It might be confusing at the start, but it's a very enjoyable product. It succesfully mixes the elements of the Warhammer 40.000 realities with some other, sometimes more, sometimes less original elements. If You liked Crysis and you don't puke on the first sights of cyberpunk and cRPG - you should enjoy the game all right, because the gameplay is closest to Crysis (using implants like cloak, superstrenght, etc).

												I'm going to preface this review saying that for a game made by 10 people and a half-finished HL2 mod it is a really neat game. It has great combat and story. The XP system has a lot of potential.Unfortunately, the save system is BROKEN. BROKEN. It only saves after (some) major missions, so if you save and quit halfway through a mission your XP is in tact but you have to start from the start of the mission the next time you play. Keep in mind that the missions are about and hour and fifteen minutes each. It's a real grind to play. If they had a simple quicksave or manual save the game would be great. Also note that the maps are HUGE for sourcemod. They aren't huge in a good way though. Sprint eats up your power and there is a lot inbetween objectives. Reinforcements sometimes respawn right behind you and score a quick kill, taking away a ressucitator, which take a lot of work to get. It's like I'm playing terrorist hunt on Rainbow Six 3:Raven Shield all over again.			",191,25,7,11,11,1,35

												This game is not for everyone, it has high learning curve, it doesn't hold your hand, it's confusing at times, infinite AI enemies are challenging (invisible laser snipers are complete BS), death mechanics is unforgiving, but if you look past this E.Y.E Divine Cybermancy will be one of the better games you've ever played.E.Y.E has a variety of huge levels (Monolith map is one of the scariest locations I've ever played through), awesome weapons, intense gunfights, excellent RPG elements, cool psi powers, sanity meter, crazy movement, atmospheric sountrack and convoluted storyline.Tips: I usually use B.O.S.C.O sniper rifle (silenced, huge zoom, infrared, accurate, large mag, wall penetration) and 444 Bear Killer Revolver for as a side arm (ridiculous damage, extreme accuracy, huge wall penetration) against humanoid enemies and Depezador pump action shotgun against metastreumonic creatures due to high ammo drum.Research Medicine first and foremost, it's the most reliable method of healing, far superior to ammo/weapon transmutation. It recharges as long as you hold it in front of you, just don't use it if the charge is below 20 or there is high chance of overdose. Secondary fire to heal yourself and primary for NPCs.Purchase Cloak augment for invisibility, it will save you a lot of time moving through levels.Use maintenance to stop bleeding.Infinite exp/ money (might be patched out): pick two first dialog lines when talking to your mentor in New Eden (2nd level) for 6k exp and 7k-9k brouzouf. Reload the level from Mission tab on character screen. Rinse and repeat. Will get you to level 50 with some patience.More Karma: kill small critters until you hit red 0 in karma meter. Reload the level (mission tab again) and you should have 100 Karma which will prevent fatal injuries.Hit Esc and quit the game if you are killed, it will prevent you from using up precious ressurections.Follow these tips and your legs will be OK. Good luck.			",55,11,1,11,4,0,1

												This game harkens back to the old school action rpg days of the original Deus Ex.  The game boasts decent controls with interesting settings and plenty of intrigue.  This game has a soul and atmosphere that is lost in most modern games.  As a bonus it isn't that pretentious of a game despite it being indie.  This is a good game for people that enjoy more classic fps/rpg hybrids a la Morrowind or the orginal Deus Ex.Pros:Good Atmosphere ( grimdark edgy world with edgy people, but the small things, like the ads scattered around the city, add some semblence of life to it )Semi-Complex RPG elements ( implementation may be a little clunky, but the customization and opportunity it allows the player is always preferred over ""streamlined"" casual♥♥♥♥♥♥)Decent Controls ( for an indie game i'm content, though why i can't lean and walk makes me upset, sometimes the world just needs to be diagonal and on the move )Actually has lore ( it's mostly optional and not really shown in the game world, but world building shows care and makes a setting all the more interesting )Cons:Clunky compared to AAA Titles ( no♥♥♥♥♥♥really )Tutorial videos are boring ( and optional, I probably don't know half the♥♥♥♥♥♥i can do )Slow beginning ( really off putting for me until i powered through the first segement or two ) ",235,27,5,20,16,2,25

When you learn how the abilities work and how to use them , there are some awesome stuff you can do , like super jumps and converting objects in the environment to go towards your Health Points.You can dual wield weapons aswell , which is really awesome.If you do pick up this game , read a guide or watch a tutorial on Youtube or something.Oh , you can also play the whole campaign with up to 31 other friends.

												The complete and total lack of a real tutorial for this game makes it almost 100% unplayable.  It just throws you in and expects you to get going on your own.  There seems to be a lot of really promising parts of this game but with no real way to get started I do not see a reason to waste any time on it.  And don't even get me started on how dull and boring the beginning of the game is.  No explanation of what is going on or why you are doing what you are doing.  This game is a let down to say the least.  I have not totally given up however.  I will try and play it some more and see if it changes my opinion with a little more time.

												Went in expecting Deus Ex, only to find it was more like Dark Souls with guns. Now I like Dark Souls, but at least Dark Souls follows certain rules and conventions. This game is just all over the place. The real 'prepare to die' experience starts here!-Objectives are often vague, and while venturing around a large map trying to figure out how to get to the waypoint feels like a nice touch of exploration, it's ruined by the respawning enemies (see below).-Damage is way too high (even on Easy), and a grenade in a tight corridor is effectively a death sentence.-The fact that enemies respawn means you'll often be attacked from behind just when you thought you'd thoroughly cleared the area. At least you can always run back to the mobile armoury for ammo...-The grammar and tone of the dialogue feels like it was written by a high-schooler who averaged Ds in English.-Can't make heads of tails of the plot. The story beginning with an amnesiac protagonist thrown into the middle of a civil war / political coup (is that what's happening?) doesn't make it much easier. I've heard of 'in media res' but this is ridiculous.-WHY ARE THERE SO MANY ENEMIES, I TURNED THE RESPAWN RATE WAY DOWN, OH GOD THEY'RE ALL OVER ME-Stats and classes are also a little tricky to figure out. I'm sure they do something, but I don't really feel any different after multiple level-ups.-Occasional difficulty telling which doors can and can't be interacted with.-Reloading causes you to waste any unused bullet in the current magazine (WHAT the ACTUAL ♥♥♥♥). Add in the fact that there is no automatic reloading when you run out of bullets and you will choke in almost every single high-pressure situation.-Some odd level geometry causes problems with movement here and there, particularly when moving in and out of vents or past deceptively small-looking bits of rubble/pipe/what-have-you.+Saving up for upgrades and equipment is a nice incentive. You get currency bonuses for high-performance combat (headshots, backstabs, etc), so you get rewarded for not just spraying and praying.+The style of clothing, technology and - in some cases - architecture is pretty cool.+Some levels contain posters of hot girls with guns.+The melee weapons all look really cool, and the ability to defend against projectiles makes them HUGELY useful.+/- what language is everyone speaking and whyMaybe I'm playing this game wrong, but honestly, it just feels bad and unenjoyable to play. 4/10, would not recommend.

												E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy is an interesting game with ambitious features and design but that is also the games ultimate downfall. While looking a little dated on the Source engine it's certainly not ugly. The art style is very consistent and it has a great atmosphere that draws you into this weird cyber world.The one big problem the game has is the horrible interface and hacking mechanic. Like so many games before it trying to include a hacking mechanic it ultimately fails not because it's bad but because the interface and feedback for the user is horrible. The whole inventory management is a chore that take out the fun of an otherwise good game.The gunplay is decent and the AI while simple can still surprise you sometimes.3/5 Kangaroomice+ Atmospheric Religious Cyberpunk Mashup+ Complex character development- Horrible UI- Awkward controls - Simple gunplay			",832,275,44,132,120,7,177

												E.Y.E. Divine Cybermancy is definitely one of the most fun and innovative games I’ve ever played. Set in a futuristic cyber/steampunk world, you play as a member of the secret society called E.Y.E. A special society trained in using psi powers and other high tech gadgets to accomplish their mission.  E.Y.E. is a top notch FPS/RPG game that allows for multiple styles of game play and plenty of character customization. You can go guns blazing, take the stealthy approach or even hack into your enemies and control their every movement. You are also in possession of a huge arsenal that carries machine guns, snipers, mini guns and even grenade launchers. With all these things at your disposal, you know this game has an amazing replay value to it. You can also go co-op with up to 16 players and wreck havoc upon the open world maps. It’s a refreshing and addicting title that I think everyone should pick up.			",371,58,4,49,2,1,15

												What happens when a game is developed and instead of focusing on a core idea, it puts all the ideas into the game. Answer:  E.Y.E. Divine Cybermancy. Now let me get this out of the way.  This is a fantastic achievement for 10 people, it has an amazing level of design and programming included, more systems than most people even attempt to conquer, and some very novel ideas. And yet it doesn't work.  Instead of just a typical game like Bioshock where you can shoot or use plasmids, in EYE you have cyber attacks, gun attacks, psiotics, drones, inventory management, hacking, and stealth.   And that there is both the benefit and negative. Yes you can play this game your way (Though it appears you need to be able to hack)  Which is an interesting idea.  However there is so much going on the player will be overwhelmed quickly in this game.  Every system is overly complicated as well.  Let's just look at the shooting system, there's many different types of weapons, each with it's own bullet type... well here's the problem with that system, it is also completely realistic.  Reload? You lose your ammo.  Want 10 magazines? you better have 10 slots.   And you WILL go through that ammo fast.  Want to pick up an item of a specific size? Better have the slot for it.   All this goes on at a breakneck speed as well. The real problem of the game is every system is like this, overly complicated, overly deep, and the player is expected to deal with these systems as fast as possible from the first moment.   What's worse is there's a bare bones tutorial system.  That means there IS a tutorial, but at the same time, the tutorial really doesn't have enough to help the player get comfortable in the system.  The fact is there's enough systems in the game to support 4 games, but because it never is delivered in a clear way, the player is left floundering. If you're willing to spend a long time learning how to play this game, you'll find a deep and engrossing world... but it's kind of hard to get over that initial hump. Of course all that ignores one final fact.. this is a source engine game.  Which means the UI is horrific... And that's really off putting.   A shame, because I think a good UI might have actually helped this game more than everything, and the developers REALLY try to make the UI work...I just don't think it really is there yet.

												E.Y.E has the strange distinction of being an FPSRPG that does not sacrifice FPS for RPG or vice versa - the gunplay is solid, but the RPG gameplay is also on par with it. The setting is also very unique with its ""neo-midieval cyberpunk"" aesthetic. However, the story is confusing and there are plenty of rough edges. Something to be careful of is that this game is very much a 90's game - it will not hold your hand, almost ever. Though at the same time, this game provides a rock-solid gameplay core and unparalleled custom mechanics. You can even tweak spawning rates, mob difficulty, and AI settings in the options.To wrap up, get this game if you want to experience a very left-field, experimental take on FPSRPG core gameplay. I highly recommend you read wikis and other resources as you play, as they make discovering this game more enjoyable than going blind. Personally, I love this game just because it's not afraid of what it is - an extremely ambitious game with rough edges.			",240,34,3,7,9,0,19

												10 hours in... Campaign so far is mehh. Presentation: Mehhh - low budget; hardly any voice acting and music is so-so.Graphics wise - well, nothing spectuacular but won't disappoint - Source engine after all.Gameplay: Awesome, quite retro to the sense of Deus Ex - You develop attributes and purchase powers based on those said attributes. Tactical depth is pretty deep - sniping, possessing turrets/drones, gun-blazing, or a combination of those makes any engagement a blast.Solo gameplay feels very difficult at times when enemies become numerous and difficult to bring down. I have yet to try multiplayer as of this moment.Side note on gameplay: Hacking enemies is tedious, at times I think more annoying than anything because you WILL be coming under fire while doing so - unlike the trailer it presented. Steep learning curve - The numerous options availble to you creates this paradox.8/10, I'd give this game an 8 for gameplay more than anything else			",74,7,0,18,6,0,15

												Alot of people don't know this game exists until a sale. But it is an interesting take of a dystopian future in the source engine with a few more graphical effects and features, such as the armory and weapon dealing. The thing it lacks is probably a map or something to levels  as you mostly feel lost in the cities or canyons. In terms of story, you are, i suppose, a divine knight that utilises the pistols, katanas, miniguns, sniper rifles, assault rifles, grenades, sentry guns/drone and psi powers against the set targets of a mission. You can use skill points from experiance to upgrade the usual stuff, and can even hack into other peoples sentrys and even themselves, to control, or destroy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a game where you play as a psychic-cyborg-warrior-monk thing of a man wielding a katana that's not only powered by some eldritch thing that keeps blinking at you, but can also slice your enemies in half AND block freaking lasers! You can hack people so that their brains explode!You can clone yourself and unleash a small squad of yourself on your enemies!You can run as fast as a Olympic-sprinter and jump twice your own height! This is a decent description of your character at the start of the tutorial.AFTER THAT YOUR POWER GROWS!!!In the name of honesty, there is some bugs and (unintended) weirdness, but if the above sentences didn't grab you then nothing will. Imagine Deus Ex if it had been made by french people on peyote, while they played WAY too much Warhammer 40K and re watched Blade runner and Ghost in the shell for the hundredth time and you won't be far off!

												Firstly, the concept is amazing. Kind of like a cross between Warhammer 40K (as has been said before), Blade Runner, Dune, Total Recall, Equilibrium, and probably a few other classics I can't think of right now, with a lot of original - and borrowed, stuff on the surface and underneath, including paranormal phenomena, cyberpunk and genetic body mods, hacking, genetic manipulation for basic skill boosts/affinities, and futuristic Rastafarianism. The quintessential Sci-Fi nerd's game, IMO.There's a money system for investing in physical/cybernetic enhancements and weapons, and research toward the same, all funded by things like bounties, hacking bank computers, and lump-sum mission completion rewards. There's also a skill point-based leveling system with lots of options for specialization, e.g., stealth, brute force, finesse, faster/greater health/recovery, athletics/acrobatics, psychic control/telekinesis, hacking enemy machinery/weapons - even their  brains to do your bidding (but watch out, you may get hacked if they're better than you!), et al.Some say it tries to do too much. I like all of the things it does too much to agree. Granted, the dialogue seems to be poorly translated, but in a far-flung future, a significant change in vernacular isn't inconceivable. I think it adds depth, in that respect. Maybe it was deliberate. There's also a bit of a learning curve due to a clunky tutorial, but creating a couple of throw-away characters while practicing and figuring out what you like isn't at all uncommon.

												Fun game, though totally insane.  The story is there, but I certainly can't figure out what's going on.  It might make more sense if I read through the game's history, but the writing is so bad that I can't do it.  All that being said, the game is incredibly fun in it's schitzophrenia.  I can use a sword, pistol, assault rifle, or psychic powers to kill my enemies.  I gain levels.  I play a bizarre hacking mini-game to take control of doors and turrets.  I am a jedi/samurai/sharpshooter/cyborg with amnesia.  Also, E.Y.E. Divine Cybermancy is probably the coolest trio of nonsense words ever.			",202,46,10,37,9,2,23

												Absolutely recommend picking this game up. It's a bit difficult to grasp, but once you get rolling, (and this is all assuming you're a cyberpunk fan) you won't be able to drop it. The eerie and gloomy atmosphere is sure to immerse you completely, the fun, innovative gameplay is bound to keep you constantly searching for new ways to overcome a problem, and if all else fails - the randomly generated missions will always be there for a quick jolt when you're in a race with time.The story is a marvel the likes of which I haven't seen yet. I read a lot of books, I watch a lot of movies, shows, but E.Y.E.'s incredibly complex, multi-dimensional, multi-layered allegorical presentation of consciousness was genuinely one of the greatest experiences of my life. As a matter of fact - I believe that the specific story (which I leave for you to figure out) is in its optimal medium; no book or song could ever transfer the atmosphere the same way this game does. The amount of thought I put into the thematic of the whole game, and the amount of time I spent trying to understand the underlying philosophical problems - both in the game, and transfered into real life - is unprecedented.As many agree, if you're one in favor of immersive, drawn-out, atmospheric surrounding, and if you're a fan of the strange, -AND- an enthusiastic problem-solver, this masterpiece will become one of your favorites, too. The game offers too much of the three for anyone to miss them during gameplay, and is sure to have something for everyone who doesn't play video games just for the pure time-wasting aspect of it, but for the artistic value.And before you decide to opt out, riddle me this - ""Are you lost? Or have you been lost since the very beginning?""			",60,5,1,1,4,0,3

												tl;dr: Good: The level design, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ story if you're the kind that likes to speculate, and weapons not saddled by the need to be ""realistic"" or even balancedBad: They're not the smartest cops or looters. LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG loading times. The story if the storytelling style isn't something that you can't really appreciateWherever you go, whoever you side with, you will always Brouzouf. This insane first person shooter/RPG hybrid has one of the craziest stories ever written, where the story lapses in and out of coherence and continuity, yet still works very well. The enviroments are amazing and highly inspired, and massive. Quite a feat, especially with source engine. While there is one huge loading screen at the beginning of the huge levels, they are the only ones, there are no loading screens anywhere within a level, in the the massive ones like the Headquarters or Mars. Enemies look great, although their intellegence leaves a bit to be desired. One looter blew his buddy up after shooting him with his shotgun that he was aiming at me. Well, the first one shouldn't have stood in his way anyways. Enemy spawn can be a bit of a pain, too. New Eden has a spot next to some shipping containers that spawns Federal Police whenever you're not facing, even if you're facing away but standing next to the spawn point, they'll spawn. Then shoot you. Secreta help you if they have the dreaded Bear Killer. That would mean you have the demon gun too, though. You do have it, right? Brings up another point: the weapons. Dear God those weapons. A handgun that is an effective anti-air and anti-demon cannon. A minigun good against large groups of squishy Feds, Looters, and beasts, although not the best choice for armored enemies like Interceptors. A shotgun that goes further, so much further, than a sneeze. A katana that blows people up. Even the AK knockoff has an awesome feel for it. An SMG that has two firing modes: Full and Fuller. It all comes from the magical Armory of Holding in the beginning of each level that makes you feel like you're going through a candy store with a ""all you can eat"" coupon. Some minor complaints. Again the AI. You've probably already know my gripes so no further. Furthering the skill tree involves randomly dropping briefcases, in which those have randomly generated technology dropped, some of them being much rarer than others. You can find S.O.B 13 easy, though if you find Cybernecromancy, go ahead and buy a lottery ticket right after. It can be a pain to unlock weapons and technology because of this. If you play on the lower difficulties, it can also be difficult to gather enough brouzouf, cold hard cash, to fund research, cyberlimbs, PSI abilities, and most importantly: weapons. This is easily remedied by not being a wimp and cranking the difficulty up: Ghost usually has you swimming in cash, particuarly if you unlock the Bear Killer and go Dues Ex Machina and Interceptor hunting with it. The AI I can forgive because the rest of the game carries it, and also because this game gets cheaper than a meal at In-N-Out during sales. The rest of the issues can be remedied or at least fixed with a bandaid by adjusting spawn rates and AI behavior. Overall, I highly recommend this game. It looks a bit dated but the design is great, the guns feel deadly, and it doesn't feel the need to limit the player in case he gets ""too strong"".			",57,3,7,8,5,0,9

While the engine is old, the translation not-so-awesome, and the rate of research drops absolutely silly, the rest of the game is well worth $10 any day.

												Firstly, the concept is amazing. Kind of like a cross between Warhammer 40K (as has been said before), Blade Runner, Dune, Total Recall, Equilibrium, and probably a few other classics I can't think of right now, with a lot of original - and borrowed, stuff on the surface and underneath, including paranormal phenomena, cyberpunk and genetic body mods, hacking, genetic manipulation for basic skill boosts/affinities, and futuristic Rastafarianism. The quintessential Sci-Fi nerd's game, IMO.There's a money system for investing in physical/cybernetic enhancements and weapons, and research toward the same, all funded by things like bounties, hacking bank computers, and lump-sum mission completion rewards. There's also a skill point-based leveling system with lots of options for specialization, e.g., stealth, brute force, finesse, faster/greater health/recovery, athletics/acrobatics, psychic control/telekinesis, hacking enemy machinery/weapons - even their  brains to do your bidding (but watch out, you may get hacked if they're better than you!), et al.Some say it tries to do too much. I like all of the things it does too much to agree. Granted, the dialogue seems to be poorly translated, but in a far-flung future, a significant change in vernacular isn't inconceivable. I think it adds depth, in that respect. Maybe it was deliberate. There's also a bit of a learning curve due to a clunky tutorial, but creating a couple of throw-away characters while practicing and figuring out what you like isn't at all uncommon.

												This game may be seen as a mess at first, and honestly it is, but there's something very special about that seperates it from other FPS games of today. Imagine a universe with a combination of Deus Ex, WH40k, Half Life, and Killzone, mix it up in a blender and you got E.Y.E Divine Cybermancy. This game has so many choices and so many options that it actually seems too complex for the player at first (if buying this game, I'd recommend watching How To's first as the game does not explain each of the features). Don't despair, and press on as this game has wonderful immersion and you will be able to catch on quickly. I almost immediately got addicted and played nearly 9 hours straight. I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves Deus Ex			",266,16,4,26,19,2,50

												E.Y.E. is a difficult game.Not only in terms of unforgiving gameplay, but also in terms of game quality.On one hand it amazes and revolutionizes the fps genre with such an incredible and deep gameplay that is should baffle even deus ex players what this game pulls of there.On the other hand the game can be very bugging, frustrating and partially random; this is clearly a game for hardcore fps/rpg players, and it is without any doubt the hardest fps I ever played in my whole life.If I would need to describe the gameplay, I would say it is a fps/rpg grindgame. There is a story (which is a bit confusing, but pretty awesome once you got it)  and an own world with it's punks and metastreunomic forces, but it doesn't really matter that hard cause you play the game to level up your character.Also the shooting mechanics are very fun!A secret tip for fps/rgp players!

												The main draw (for me at least) in E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy is the atmosphere. With great ambiant music and story, you feel very immersed in this cyberpunk title. Despite people complaining about the translation, you can still follow the story farily well as different factions vie for power among completing other objectives. This game often goes on sale (for as low as $0.99) and it's worth every single penny. Very indepth RPG elements, fun fire fights with enemies, and overall just a surprisingly pleasing title.If you're a cyberpunk fan, you shouldn't pass this up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												E.Y.E is far from perfect. It's weird, obtuse to the point of being frustrating and the dialogue often feels like it's been run through Google translate (Streum On are French, so it probably has). The weirdness is actually one of the things I like about it though. The grammatically flawed text not so much; Streum could definitely benefit from a native English speaker going through all the dialogue and making it less obviously written by someone who isn't.But the weirdness works. E.Y.E comes across like a blend between 40K's Inquisition and one of the evil megacorps of Syndicate; with it's bizarre mix of psionic techno-magery, cyberpunk gadgetry and John Blanche-esque armour suits. It gets compared a lot to a 'fever dream'; and given the developer's stated enjoyment of H.P Lovecraft, this is not a bad comparison. E.Y.E's very openended and that can work against it for some - too much choice, especially with little guidance as to how those choices will affect you in the field, can be off-putting. You do have to read around the little windows and you sometimes have to live with a choice that might not have been exactly what you were expecting. Enemy levels can be a tad overwhelming, too. Freely re-spawning legions of mooks are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥when combined with big, dark, labyrinths and vague mission briefs and this can make the side-quests (which are pretty basic; essentially retreads of levels you've completed with different random objectives like Kill X, Fetch Y), feel a touch grindy as you mow down two gangs of mooks only to be set on by two more as you reload and scavenge bullets from the corpses. Steam's recommendation windows are really too small - so, yeah. E.Y.E's interface and tutorials are almost ferociously unfriendly to those of us who've grown accustomed to the hand-holding of more recent RPG / FPS releases. E.Y.E leans more to the school of ""Here, work it out for yourself."" Which has been one of the big bones of contention about it for many. Purely for clarity; I mean good, old Syndicate, not the shoddy modern FPS with the brand name tacked on. But it still feels fun; the guns work well and slicing and dicing the enemy with your psionic katana and blue-glowy psi-fist is still satisfying (see also the teleporting into other people to make them explode method). Although it's billed as an FPS/RPG, the RPG side of things is mainly a case of what numbers you put up on your character sheet, although there are plot twisty things down the line.Me, I like it. As has been observed, what other game lets you cloak and teleport yourself into the body of an enemy so that they explode?Also, it's cheap. And has trading cards :gordon: Give it a whirl.

												       Let me tell that you will have a love-hate relationship with this game while playing it. First of all, it has really a really unclear story and poorly translated dialogue plus the narrative is poorly delivered and mostly received through dialogue.Information in this game is also very poorly delivered as the game's tutorials will teach you chicken♥♥♥♥♥♥The A.I  is a mix of super intelligent and incredibly stupid, here's an example; the A.I  is smart enough to detect a dead body and spot you from a mile away but will often run straight towards you and get shot plus they deal alot of damage and this game can be really hard at times [trust me I played DarkSouls] Besides that, the game has alot of glitches and is repetitive in quite a number of aspects throughout gameplay.  Although it lacks content it makes up for really satistfying gunfights, really fun cyber implants and augments, a really nice art style and soundtrack and good character models. Overall the game ends up being just above average I would recommend this game to anyone who can tolerate a little bad medicine..  [actually alot]     My Rating: 6/10     P.S  If you plan on playing this game you're gonna have to read a quick quide first...			",38,3,0,9,2,0,1

												Amazing game, one of those games where you have to be a lot more tactical than strong.  The chance of getting a failed attack can mess you up, or you could get yourself hacked and killed. The different cybertech limbs and and implants along with the ability to hack almost anything has changed this gaming experience from anything I have ever seen.			",142,16,1,30,9,1,26

												The main draw (for me at least) in E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy is the atmosphere. With great ambiant music and story, you feel very immersed in this cyberpunk title. Despite people complaining about the translation, you can still follow the story farily well as different factions vie for power among completing other objectives. This game often goes on sale (for as low as $0.99) and it's worth every single penny. Very indepth RPG elements, fun fire fights with enemies, and overall just a surprisingly pleasing title.If you're a cyberpunk fan, you shouldn't pass this up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My hacking attempt had failed and so Rimanah stood there with the Black Crow to my head.  As I waited for him to pull the trigger I realised that he wasn't going to.  He wasn't going to because he was waiting for me.  Why?  Because he wasn't there to begin with.  I was holding the Black Crow.  I and I alone.  I lower the gun from my temple and slowly stand.  The wind blows with force now, carrying the stench of half remembered crimes.  I put the Black Crow away and see that my legs are Ok.  So I draw the Damocles and, with a force that sunders the ground beneath my feet, hurl myself a titan's span into the grinning face of the Deuse Ex.  Why?  Because my hacking attempt had failed.  My hacking attempt failed because you can't hack a dream.			",153,67,0,10,4,2,7

												I bought it a couple of years ago, played for a few minutes, then gave up... I reinstalled it today because I couldn't remember why did I give up playing it before. Now I remember why: the terribly complicated interface and its tiny writings. If you want to understand what's what, what's not and what's going on, you'll have to do a lot of reading, and I have to say, reading those tiny little letters in a greenish/grayish kind of environment involves a lot of eye strain... Now I realize that the name of the game must be a hint as to what you'll be in for, should you decide to play it. Now the gameplay and combat are alright, if you can look past the dated graphics. Overall, its an OK shooter with some RPG elements, unfortnatelly I cannot tell you more because as I said, the interface drives me crazy and I cannot get myself to like the whole thing because of that. For the price it normally sells (on sale today for 1,99), I'd recommend anyone to give it a try, maybe you won't find the same issues I did, and you'll get to have a nice experience. Good luck.

												5/10 It's a very good idea in a very bad casing. The interface and the control system is chaotic. The game is lack of regular tutorials, instead it contains a lot of small videos of ""how to use"" things. It wouldn't be bad, if you don't have to open them manually and search for that one what you actually need. A little more effort and design by the developers side, and this game could become one of the best games...The singleplayer is confusing. The multiplayer is dying. If you have at least four people to play with, give it a try.Else this game will be some kind of bittersweet experience.			",471,132,17,52,47,4,74

												tl;dr: Good: The level design, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ story if you're the kind that likes to speculate, and weapons not saddled by the need to be ""realistic"" or even balancedBad: They're not the smartest cops or looters. LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG loading times. The story if the storytelling style isn't something that you can't really appreciateWherever you go, whoever you side with, you will always Brouzouf. This insane first person shooter/RPG hybrid has one of the craziest stories ever written, where the story lapses in and out of coherence and continuity, yet still works very well. The enviroments are amazing and highly inspired, and massive. Quite a feat, especially with source engine. While there is one huge loading screen at the beginning of the huge levels, they are the only ones, there are no loading screens anywhere within a level, in the the massive ones like the Headquarters or Mars. Enemies look great, although their intellegence leaves a bit to be desired. One looter blew his buddy up after shooting him with his shotgun that he was aiming at me. Well, the first one shouldn't have stood in his way anyways. Enemy spawn can be a bit of a pain, too. New Eden has a spot next to some shipping containers that spawns Federal Police whenever you're not facing, even if you're facing away but standing next to the spawn point, they'll spawn. Then shoot you. Secreta help you if they have the dreaded Bear Killer. That would mean you have the demon gun too, though. You do have it, right? Brings up another point: the weapons. Dear God those weapons. A handgun that is an effective anti-air and anti-demon cannon. A minigun good against large groups of squishy Feds, Looters, and beasts, although not the best choice for armored enemies like Interceptors. A shotgun that goes further, so much further, than a sneeze. A katana that blows people up. Even the AK knockoff has an awesome feel for it. An SMG that has two firing modes: Full and Fuller. It all comes from the magical Armory of Holding in the beginning of each level that makes you feel like you're going through a candy store with a ""all you can eat"" coupon. Some minor complaints. Again the AI. You've probably already know my gripes so no further. Furthering the skill tree involves randomly dropping briefcases, in which those have randomly generated technology dropped, some of them being much rarer than others. You can find S.O.B 13 easy, though if you find Cybernecromancy, go ahead and buy a lottery ticket right after. It can be a pain to unlock weapons and technology because of this. If you play on the lower difficulties, it can also be difficult to gather enough brouzouf, cold hard cash, to fund research, cyberlimbs, PSI abilities, and most importantly: weapons. This is easily remedied by not being a wimp and cranking the difficulty up: Ghost usually has you swimming in cash, particuarly if you unlock the Bear Killer and go Dues Ex Machina and Interceptor hunting with it. The AI I can forgive because the rest of the game carries it, and also because this game gets cheaper than a meal at In-N-Out during sales. The rest of the issues can be remedied or at least fixed with a bandaid by adjusting spawn rates and AI behavior. Overall, I highly recommend this game. It looks a bit dated but the design is great, the guns feel deadly, and it doesn't feel the need to limit the player in case he gets ""too strong"".			",57,3,7,8,5,0,9

												This game may be seen as a mess at first, and honestly it is, but there's something very special about that seperates it from other FPS games of today. Imagine a universe with a combination of Deus Ex, WH40k, Half Life, and Killzone, mix it up in a blender and you got E.Y.E Divine Cybermancy. This game has so many choices and so many options that it actually seems too complex for the player at first (if buying this game, I'd recommend watching How To's first as the game does not explain each of the features). Don't despair, and press on as this game has wonderful immersion and you will be able to catch on quickly. I almost immediately got addicted and played nearly 9 hours straight. I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves Deus Ex			",266,16,4,26,19,2,50

												E.Y.E has the strange distinction of being an FPSRPG that does not sacrifice FPS for RPG or vice versa - the gunplay is solid, but the RPG gameplay is also on par with it. The setting is also very unique with its ""neo-midieval cyberpunk"" aesthetic. However, the story is confusing and there are plenty of rough edges. Something to be careful of is that this game is very much a 90's game - it will not hold your hand, almost ever. Though at the same time, this game provides a rock-solid gameplay core and unparalleled custom mechanics. You can even tweak spawning rates, mob difficulty, and AI settings in the options.To wrap up, get this game if you want to experience a very left-field, experimental take on FPSRPG core gameplay. I highly recommend you read wikis and other resources as you play, as they make discovering this game more enjoyable than going blind. Personally, I love this game just because it's not afraid of what it is - an extremely ambitious game with rough edges.			",240,34,3,7,9,0,19

												This is a game where you play as a psychic-cyborg-warrior-monk thing of a man wielding a katana that's not only powered by some eldritch thing that keeps blinking at you, but can also slice your enemies in half AND block freaking lasers! You can hack people so that their brains explode!You can clone yourself and unleash a small squad of yourself on your enemies!You can run as fast as a Olympic-sprinter and jump twice your own height! This is a decent description of your character at the start of the tutorial.AFTER THAT YOUR POWER GROWS!!!In the name of honesty, there is some bugs and (unintended) weirdness, but if the above sentences didn't grab you then nothing will. Imagine Deus Ex if it had been made by french people on peyote, while they played WAY too much Warhammer 40K and re watched Blade runner and Ghost in the shell for the hundredth time and you won't be far off!  You'll either love it or hate it, but try the demo at least, if nothing else it's unique.			",116,51,0,24,8,2,24

												This game is... really odd. It's an FPS RPG on the source engine with some strange mechanics that make gameplay difficult and confusing. It's also one of my favorite games of all time.Aside from the run of the mill gunplay (which is really solid and satisfying for the most part), theres a whole world of complicated menu-based spells, some of which (mainly hacking anything, like ANYTHING in the game to aid you) begins an RTS-like miniagme in which you manage a variety of stats to out-hack your opponent.The game is not friendly to newcomers in both it's gameplay and lore, but an intriguing story, cool visual style, and gameplay thats fun wether you know whats going on or not, make it something definatey worth playing.

												The main draw (for me at least) in E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy is the atmosphere. With great ambiant music and story, you feel very immersed in this cyberpunk title. Despite people complaining about the translation, you can still follow the story farily well as different factions vie for power among completing other objectives. This game often goes on sale (for as low as $0.99) and it's worth every single penny. Very indepth RPG elements, fun fire fights with enemies, and overall just a surprisingly pleasing title.If you're a cyberpunk fan, you shouldn't pass this up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There's a lot of unusual features added that are a bit clumsy to use. Still, clearly a lot of work has gone into it. Might be worth checking out if you like Half-Life 2 mods.

												The whole game feels so alien, so strange, but there are just enough common threads along this winding, confusing, rambling journey that make the whole game feel not just unique, but damn good. Like a recurring dream that, despite not making any sense, is pleasant and always feels like it's going somewhere, but then, you always wake up, wondering what will happen next. And you'll keep wondering as you play, and after the game's conclusion. But you'll have to work for that. This game is brutally dificult, and it's more difficult the more badass you want your character to be. This can be alleviated by inviting friends with their skill trees leveled in all the skills you've neglected, but regardless of the route you take, becoming a good, independent player will take a lot of time, and a lot of patience.The combat is... Well, what you'd expect from a Source game. Bullets hit their targets, melee is either useless or incredibly effective with no inbetweens, the ragdolls and gore are pretty nice, the textures are adequate and the sound design is good. The soundtrack is lovely and captures the dark, surreal cyberpunk atmosphere of this game perfectly.This is by no means a perfect game, but it is crafted in such a way that even its odd little quirks and subtle flaws do not detract from the experience, and in some cases, even add to its charm.No game like this has been made quite like this one before in terms of its overall presentation and atmosphere, and perhaps there will never be another game like this one, even if a sequel is made.But hey, that's just me- I understand that this is, at the end of the day, a strange product with a niche audience, and one could safely say that you could go your whole life without buying this and playing this, but I sincerely hope you do anyways.

If you like classic FPS/RPG mixed games along the lines of Dues Ex or S.T.A.L.K.E.R. then you will love this.  Or if you enjoy either FPS or RPG games.  There is a lot of content in this one, and it is pretty stable.  Still a bit buggy, and some features arent full explained.

That's also pretty great, even if they die in one shot.Then you unlock the ability to telefrag enemies on command.Then you get a pistol that destroys helicopters in two shots.Then you get a hammer that destroys them in one hit.Then you get the ability to just throw a car at the helicopter to destroy it.All of this while sprinting at 50 miles per hour.In heavy armor.it's pretty neat			",325,155,6,80,28,5,83

It is really, really fun, despite its issues.However, I will say; there are issues. Balance does not exist. Enemies will destroy you if you're not careful, and generally everything is ridiculously overpriced.I think the complete lack of balance doesn't hamper the fun of the game, but I do know people who feel that way.If you enjoy a well-rounded RPG, and yes, this game IS an RPG full-sale, this may not be for you.If you enjoy a game for how ridiculous it can be, like roguelikes?

You spawn with a random weapon and one full magazine. So you might get a double barrel sawn-off that only slighly scratches somebody or a nuke launcher in tight spaces. And if you are lucky you might get a medkit which is also considered a weapon, because at low charge it has a chance to overdose the target.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Lets say, I love this game.Huge RPG elements (story, experience, leveling, store interface,) with good combat mechanics, and an interesting world. Simply put, the type of game I've been waiting for since I was 4.If this game had been made by a highly funded game studio, or with kickstarter-like backing, it would have been absolutely amazing. As is, the over-the-top awesome is shaded by some serious problems. A very steep learning curve, and a truely vile interface take some of the wind out of the game. Add in the occasional random deaths, and the occasional game-breaking bug, and it can be an exercise in rage management.That being said, if a dozen games came out just like this, with different stories and slightly varied mechanics, I would buy them all and play 100+ hours on each.Goods:Fluid combatWell designed/implemented RPG elementsExcellent world/universeBads:Awkward interfaceOccasional awkward bugsLimited tutorialConsistently mediocre translation/language use			",203,43,0,73,41,3,78

												This game is a hard game to review. I love almost everything about this game from the surreal cyberpunk atmosphere to the sick sense of humor expressed through character actions and dialogue.Unfortunately, it isn't wrong to say this game is incomplete.It is complete as far as the developers are concerned, but it lacks a proper tutorial system, the game is generally riddled with bugs, the level design can be confusing and sometimes monotonous, and the story is utterly devoid of a conclusion. This game is not for the impatient. You really have to be willing to experiment and explore to thoroughly enjoy this game.All of that said, if you have the right mindset and a couple of good friends to play with this game can be a blast. The story is deep and is very good overall, but it can be confusing and difficult to follow. The upgrades and leveling system can be very rewarding and the powers and abilities are very useful in certain situations. And if you have enough friends this game supports 32 player coop, so thats pretty fun.			",156,14,3,28,15,1,35

												The game's pretty fun, there are lots of ways you can take out your enemy, by shooting, by hacking, by hitting with melee weapons, by blasting with psi powers, etc.Despite what people say, this game isn't stable... it's liable to crashes, sometimes the multiplayer bugs out, the ranking system sticks to the first rank you attain and doesn't upgrade further (besides the Eqillibrium ranks). Some of the achevements don't work. The stealth system isn't much good unless your have a cloak upgrade. Some of the enemies are overpowered. There are fatal wounds which forever affect your stats, which can be pretty annoying (especially for those who are focusing their skill points on single skills to earn ranks).Other than all that, it's a fun and challenging game. I highly recommend you play the demo first before buying the full game, just to see what it's like.			",169,61,1,25,8,0,25

												Messed up, confusional, mysterious, and a story hard to understand, but easy to match it up by yourself (if you're insane enough). That's why i love this game.E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy is one of the best shooter RPG i have ever played, with a story set in a futuristic cyberpunk world and a plot full of mystery, with a gameplay that gives you great freedom of customization for your character with lots of ways to upgrade your character.Also being the game set in a distant future, there are surely some features in the game that fits this age, like the hacking system, since everything is computerized (even your mind), that will let you get into particular objectives, control your enemies, rob some money and more.Another feature of the game is the sanity meter, that is pretty much self-explanatory: you will lose sanity when you see too much strange or bad stuffs, or when your mental power is low, and when you lose too much of it, you'll start seeing and hearing random things.The game has almost infinite replayability, with  different kind of ""endings""  and extra missions that you can do for the different map models, or obviously to gain more money and experience.The audio of most important dialogues is chinese, so better you put the subtitles on if you don't understand the language, to get something more about the game.For the multiplayer, there aren't much people playing into the servers, but you can surely grab some friends to play the campaign togheter (i had to use the Hamachi tool to make it run and modified some stuff in the console, since the game is powered by the Source engine).That is it. I loved the game once i understood how to play it and how to give a sense to the story, since  it's damn hard to give it a sense if you don't put together all the pieces of the puzzle, because this game is, infact, a puzzle game. EXTRA NOTE FOR WHO NEEDS: In the game's folder located into steam's one, you can find the soundtrack of the game: ""Steam/SteamApps/common/EYE/EYE/sound/music"". Here you'll find in order the tracks you'll hear during the game,  and the one named ""qnJ""  is the most awesome one, that you'll hear for very little time during the game. You're welcome. EXTRA-EXTRA NOTE: Illuminati approves.			",334,41,5,35,10,3,35

												-Serious Review-I would like to say that before you say anything... i'm gonna review this game as a ""coop experience"" instead of a Singleplayer one... this game has been promoted to have a very good coop and that's why i got it ( if you will say that i have to play it SP... i think this is a ""borderlands"" type of game, where if you play it solo you'll get really REALLY bored).... But the coop experience to this day is♥♥♥♥♥♥ its unplayable... Not even with the fastest internet or fastest rig a good server can be hosted... if you're going to get it for the coop PLEASE BE AWARE THAT ITS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE.Since i couldn't complete the game and i'm not interested in complete it i'll point out what it's worth of this game:+ The level design is amazing , the only con to this is that almost all of the levels are really confusive. although it's meant to be explored you can get lost REALLY easily+ Some designs although just mix cyberpunk with medieval are really good+ Plausible gunplay+ kind of plausible melee fight+ Interesting hacking minigame... Simplistic but fun, the only con is that if you don't do it very good or you're not in the mood for hacking it will get REALLY frustrating.+ 5/10 soundtrack... some are good ... others are REALLY innecesary.- The enemies in this game ( all of them) feel bland. really nothing to offer, even the cyberdemon monster type it's really uninteresting to fight ( it's so op too... well this reminds me of Doom some how lololol)- REALLY BAD VOICE ACTING ... even Far Cry voice acting is better (believe me)- lack of tutorial or explanations about the gameplay features ( all of them are in a list of minivideos... and even the minivideo list doesn't cover much of the core gameplay)- REALLY IMPOSSIBLE MULTIPLAYER I DON'T EVEN RECOMMEND ( YES THIS INCLUDE THE MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING COOP EXPLANATION I PUT).- Really bad story, narrative, Everything... THE GAME DOESNT EVEN MAKE SENSE... DONT EVEN TRY TO MAKE SENSE OUT OF IT AS OTHER REVIEWS SAYS.I was going to put a hand down... but in the end at least the concept idea of the game its interesting... this game is a game you have to make a run and forget about it... don't even try to get a replay out of it... play it solo , finish it... and boom. end it... you're not missing much.i'd get this game if it's 3-0.99 dollars... that's what is worth... don't waste more.if you want to waste your time exploring a bit or get away with a ""different game type"" ...  i recommend it.BUT if you want to play this game in coop, make metagame coop with your friends, do the coop missions and all of that stuff: DON'T.glhf.

												It's a video game.Whatever I say about it will not be enough. Just go play it.

Also paranoia, visual and auditory hallucinations and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t! Ultra-failed attacks!Give it a chance. Or 3.

												This game has been very thought out and you need to take your time and pay attention. Since it is only a couple dollars right now I would suggest that anyone get it to try it out. Otherwise be warned that it is a challenge game that requires you to count your bullets and think tactically. Also if you are motion sick sensitive, do not get this game. Ontop of the game having insanely difficult challenges it makes it even harder to kill the enemy when you are trying to shoot them. Also do not use the sniper rifles cause getting out of the scope view takes forever. I have died a lot because of the scope view, even though I needed to snipe out some enemies in order to continue on.			",33,5,0,6,1,0,1

												This game require you to but 100% of your mental focus to it while playing or else you won't understand sh!t.The setting of E.Y.E. is...... Special, even though there's alot of games and movies that have a somewhat next to the same setting, E.Y.E. managed to deliver it in a rather strange unique way.......Gameplay is too much complicated but it's really fun once you get the hang of it.Story wise the game have massive plotholes that are only covered by reading tons of codex entries and history books and talking with different NPCs, It's really good once you get to understand what's going on (And you won't until you finish the game for the first time) but in my opinion if it was a bit more polished it would have been a AAA tragedic/Sci-fi story.all in all I would recommend E.Y.E. to anyone who's into deep sci-fi games and is ready to isolate from the outside and spend sometime reading, reading for a game that you will never forget.

												This might be the most bizarre FPS I ever played. So much, in fact, that reviewing it is a challenge itself. So here goes.It claims to be an FPS, and yet has a ton of RPG systems, including a DNA combiner with stat rolling. It has melee combat, which includes badass dual-wielding katanas (or dual-wield with guns!) and a ginormous hammer, and yet stealth doesn't work well, as they can spot you from literally a mile away (even when you can't see them yourself!) and you'll be easily overwhelmed by the insane spawn rate in certain areas of the game, with many of them having ranged enemies, and some with absurd amounts of health.There are amazing (and balanced!) PSI powers in this game, including certain ones that you earn thoughout the game, and can really help you out, and yet you use PSI for almost everything in gameplay that isn't shooting or slicing, such as running, jumping, blocking with melee, and maintenance. Research and medicine are present and very useful (you can even overdose people to death with your syringe!), but good luck finding all the random drops that you need for actual research. Hacking also exists and can be pretty useful, whether to disable turrets or open doors and posess/destroy something or someone, but you may or may not like the system used for it and you definitely need to apply a good amount of skill points to be any good at it.It has some of the most atmospheric and beautiful places and art style I've ever seen, but also many underused or even plain useless areas. It happens to be one of the most stable games I've played, with only only 1 crash during actual gameplay in my 20+ hours of game time, and yet trying to load certain maps after a few loads will frequently make your game crash, not to mention certain effect like Ultra Violence will make a successful load almost impossible, and the framerate is consistently awful in many places no matter what settings I use.There's a fascinating story to be found, with multiple paths and even a hidden ending that seems more along the lines of Deus Ex, but first time players might find it extremely confusing until they play through it a first time and start checking out all the logs and getting info from other living beings. You can switch from Light to Heavy classes and use a crazy variety of weapons and gadgets, but not only do you need to level up your stats for dozens of hours in certain cases, you also need the large amount of money to buy them... the hammer is especially insane.The game has a lot of replayability, as you can come back at any time into the maps and do side missions with random elements applied, special missions (custom maps) or jump online and play Coop or PvP with other players. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to test multiplayer myself since the community is incredibly small, even after the summer sale, which is a real shame.I'd like to end this review by saying that, unlike what many people are claiming, I actually found this game pretty easy to get into. Yes, the story and the many systems implemented are confusing at first, but starting out in the Campaign and slowly finishing it will make things much clearer for you. There are also many tutorial videos integrated into the game if you need them, and the openness of the map and objectives make you feel more at ease, since you can tackle things the way you want to. Get past those first steps and you'll understand exactly why I enjoy this game so much. It's totally worth it!			",626,190,31,121,93,17,112

												This game is a wonderfully weird cyberpunk action-RPG with weird yet interesting plot and clunky gameplay. Think of this game as original Deus Ex's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ son, now going to meet his father and having couple of beers together. That's what this game is. It is not the best shooter nor the best RPG around, but the weirdness and innovative things (Like hacking being battling) and interesting mechanics, make the game seem a bit less clunky. Still, around the sales when you can get the game cheap. It becomes from ""Try"" to ""Must-Buy"" for all the RPG fans. You must try this madness and hopefully, enjoy it as well.

												An exceptional, standout action-shooter rpg, with a few quirks, brilliant art style, and a unique vision.The gameplay is punchy, colorful, and varied enough that I find myself continuing to come back.This game is heavy with customization which will create a bump in the road for some, but once you get over this initial (5 minute) hump of the menu system, you'll have yourself onto a rocking ride set in an intriguing universe.Combat seamlessly mixes GUNS, SWORDS, and PSYCHIC POWERS, while fusing with machinery.Its a lethal combination that can be crafted to your personal taste.Hacking, Machine control, rambo-style play, stealth, super-human abilities... its all here. Whatever you want.This game sets itself apart in art style, excellent combat, nonlinear branching story (with meaningful plot points the player can influence), and a setting/mood that REALLY takes you somewhere else.If you take time to pick up the snippets of story and explore a bit you'll enjoy it more.The ambient-orchestral soundtrack is peerless for games in this category.The customization is deep and allows you to truly craft any character style you can think of.The fact that this was an indie game made for less than $1m is stunning. The production values for a game of this type are rather high.While lacking in extensive voice overs, I found that the quirky dialogue and text based story actually added literary charm from the game and did not detract from the main idea.Excellent gunplay, co-op, deathmatch, cool characters, and meaningful branching story choices will create a sense of intrigue, deep moods, and powerful action.The only thing that would stop you from enjoying this is You are tossed into the game and expected to figure it out. Please take the time (5 minutes tops) to do so. You won't regret it.For ten bucks (I got it for $5 steam sale), its a steal. It's been almost 3 years since this game came out and I'm still playing it.Somehow it just hits on all of the right notes.Play it. And if you do, message me for a multiplayer game.Good job. I hope to see more updates from this studio.			",72,5,0,1,3,0,5

												At first I didn't want to buy this game because it looked like a game focused on multi-player (Counter Strike, Neotokyo), but then I found out that it actually has single-player story and some rpg elements, so I bought it on sale and decided to give it a try.The game has a lot of potential, but the mix of genres they were trying to go for just doesn't feel right. It kind of feels like deus ex occasionaly, but the feeling is so subtle you can hardly notice. Everything in this game is a mess, you can't talk about something in it without also mentioning some poor design decisions. It has good level design, and yet it hasn'tIt has good rpg elements, and yet it hasn'tIt has a good story, and yet it hasn'tIt has a good idea behind it, and yet it feels emptyDo you see where I'm going?I feel like if the devs had more experience and a clear goal of what they want to make it'd be a great game comparable to Deus Ex and System Shock. Yet you can draw inspiration from this game, you really can. This mess of ideas makes this game unique in it's own way. I'd recommend buying this game just because of that, just because it tried to do something new and different			",108,17,1,20,8,0,13

												This is a completely insane, awesome, awe inspiring and beautiful well thought out game. The mechanics are indepth but not buggy. The weapons are fun and a little OP on lower difficulties, but easily able to change the difficulty setting. The artwork is gorgeous absolutely stunning. I can not recommend ths game more highly. It has a nice mix of RPG/FPS that isn't to far inclinded either way. There is almost a steam punky element to it, it is definetly a co-op game. I've had no problems at all so far, the only real negative i have for it. Is that sometimes it's a bit hard to see during the day, and the load times for joining a LAN is a little bit annoying. If you enjoyed Deus ex/ watch dogs you'll definetely enjoy this. It was a bargain at $1 but for me personally it was a $1 well spent. The story line is very indepth and can take quite a bit to adjust to but, you can skip a lot of it if you just want to skip straight to the action. You can go all guns blazing but you may die a lot it does cause you to think about how you select your load out for each mission. And that is the great thing your not stuck with one class you can use all weapons and change if you come across an amoury in the larger maps, they are scattered and easy enough to backtrack and find. There is a steep learning curve but if you keep at it, you certainly get many hours out of it.			",70,11,4,7,4,3,3

												It's a video game.Whatever I say about it will not be enough. Just go play it. Find the joy in getting hacked back by turrets, killing video game censors, pretending you're a samurai Rick Deckard and breaking your legs over and over again. Also paranoia, visual and auditory hallucinations and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t! Ultra-failed attacks!Give it a chance. Or 3. Game is impenetrable, but once you make sweet sweet love to it, it will open up like the most beautiful cyberpunk flower. 11/10, fun for the whole family.			",201,64,0,38,17,1,27

												What a dark, grim, obtuse, and frankly, uninteresting game.  Playing it I feel like I couldn't care less if I die because my existence is one of suicidal thoughts anyways.  And I thought, “This game is a joke, everyone must hate it.”  Untrue, other reviews have said its love it or hate it, I can't imagine who loves it or why.  To me it seems that there are so many games that are so much better than this.  Why bother?  But some people loves this game.  Maybe they live in an over-saturated perfect mecca and need something terrible in their life.			",243,61,11,29,32,0,23

												One of a select few games where the world and lore genuinely interests me. The world combines elements from things like Warhammer 40K, Deus Ex, The Matrix and is... absolutely weird, in the best possible way. The game has a stylish cyberpunk/ religious theme with some stunning level design (levels are huge too), particularly early on. The game is a pretty good shooter, guns feel good and the enormous range of unlocks, stats, researches etc. leaves plenty to be discovered. One of my favourite features is the completely customisable difficulty which includes factors such as enemy hearing radius, sight radius and respawn time. There are a few downsides, the game is pretty obtuse (although some, me included, might like that. There is no hand holding). Also, the game is pretty buggy and I suffer from frequent crashes and derps.TLDR: The game has problems, but if you like the orignal Deus Ex and enjoy themes from things such as Warhammer 40k, then this game HAS to be experienced.EDIT: One feature I forgot to mention is the element of persistence and the way your profile levels. It's pretty cool. You can also do secondary missions, which act like challenge maps, if you just want to shoot some enemies, or test new abilities. So far I have spent more time in the secondary missions than in the story missions.			",222,31,6,34,23,1,33

												A strange title indeed. You will love it and you will hate it, something only EYE can do. Its cyberpunk setting bleeds with style that deus ex wishes it could be. A nicer UI and translation is something to be desired but the true beutiy in EYE is how you can build your character anyway you want. You want to be a sneaky ninja, sprinting though front lines and slicing off limbs or stick to the shadows you can. You want to be a hacker and break in to ATMs and other's brains and make them attack on another. You can do that too.It is a game that will keep you comming back looking for new ways to handle situations and try out diffrenerent play styles untill you have built a character that is almost godlike with all your cyberimplants and spells.It is a unique title that treads where others are to afraid to go, and there is co-op so you and some firends can run around this distopian cyber wonderland together.

												Highly underrated.A surprisingly unique and in-depth game, especially for a budget title.The campaign is not that long, but with the game's multiple endings, there's a lot of replayability, especially since there's a lot to keep building up your character with. The secondary and special missions are not at all required, but some of them are very rewarding.The game is flawed in a lot of ways (bugs, hilariously bad translations,...) but the unique experience makes up for it.Note that E.Y.E. doesn't explain too much about the game. The tutorials are not that useful. However, gradually figuring the game out while playing is a lot of fun. The lore and the main story are vague and sometimes cryptic but totally worth getting into.  Do not expect much of the server browser, but playing with friends can be a lot of fun. Do I recommend this game? Hell yes.Also dirt cheap during sales, so no reason to NOT buy it then.

												.....this is a difficult one. This game has some serious issues, it has flawed mechanics, unplayable classes, unbalanced weapons as well as a very strange story. But there is something about it that I love.It has deep music, a very interesting plot. Scary elements as well as mind-screw abound. It also has the darkest techno-future atmosphere that I have ever seen. But it's a pig. Really, it's hard to love and easy to hate. It is a game where you can go invisible and strike enemies with samurai swords. A game where you will have great difficulty completing on your first run and will be left wondering at the end what to make of it all. I won't lie it isn't a game for most people, it's very offbeat, very unclassifiable. But underneath all the poor gameplay and bad story-telling, there is something about it I like. It has atmosphere. It's sombre, dark and sometimes scary. Darkened corridors where beasts could come at you from nowhere if you don't pay attention. Red alert lights flash while you thud your cyberboots around, looking for an access panel to hack to stop the damn defense turrets from targetting you. All while on an alien and completely inhoispitable planet somewhere in a distant future which is calous, cruel or downright ignorant to your plight. Or closer to home where cyber-punks fight the megacorp soldiers. Chinese writing sprawled in holographic advertisements accross walls. Tenement blocks under siege from monstrous creatures. The spawn of an alien force known as the metastreum. They are relentless, and they never stop coming. But you have a mission to complete, you can let the soldiers and beasts fight amongst themselves. It's the future and it's dark, just like it should be. That is the atmosphere of the game. But ultimately, it suffers from too many set-backs to make it a good game, or even an average game. Really, it's worth no more than £3. And even then, only if you are a certain kind of person. Check it out on youtube to see what I mean.			",133,21,0,11,2,0,12

												Have you ever wondered what's it like to be insane? Well, then this is the game for you. E.Y.E is an RPG that does a great job of fooling you into thinking it's an FPS action game. Kill scores of enemies, make made brozouf, get used to constantly repairing your broken cyber legs and learn what it feels like to get hacked by an ATM. Use your experience points to become the ultimate magical space warrior, spend your brozoufs to replace your cheap space chinese manufactured legs with slightly better ones. Weapons, drones, invisibility cloaks, space magic - all are for sale as long as you got the brozoufs to pay the greedy space merchants. Oh and don't trust anyone, they're all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, including you - the main character. Fight, struggle and do ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ all in an atempt to escape the cycles of your guilt and figure out what it all means, then do it all over again.			",260,31,3,42,16,1,63

												Story:The story itself is not so bad, but badly written/translated dialogues are a big drawback. By the way, english is not my native language, but even I spotted some errors.Design:The design its not so bad, it is a real cyberpunk game with some fantasy elements. The style of the game is not bad, but its unpolished and cheap (I will talk more about it in graphics section). The game system is not bad, but there are things like ""permanent wounds"", too many respawns (there is no game over), endless enemy spawns and researches, that were really bad ideas. The interface is not intuitive at all, if you never played games like Deus Ex before, you are going to have a hard time to figure out what to do and you will need a lot of patience, to watch many ingame video tutorials.Graphics:We can not really talk about graphics in this game. It is a source engine game, but when you play Half-Life 2 nowadays, you can still say, it has good graphics, but you can not say this about this game. Same ugly textures are used repetitively. There is lack of variety in character models. By the way, you can not find any characters with full face, everyone have at least half of his/her face covered. The level design is terrible and lazy, very lazy. There are many empty spaces and many impasses with no point. The best map is ""New Eden"" and even there you can feel the cheapness.Audio:I really like the music, it sets the dark mood of the game. There is no voice acting at all, you need to read all dialogues.Gameplay:Shooting with guns is fun, but some powers that you can unlock later are very unique and really fun to use. Missions can be done aggressively or in stealth, but do not expect any chances for pacifism (this is something I like in this game).Conclusion:Well, after so much negative said, you maybe think that there is no reason to play this game, but if you have some good friend/friends with which you can play this game, then it is enjoyable. Even if you play alone, you can have fun for several hours. But to be honest even with friends, this game can be really boring after few hours of gameplay.			",371,104,14,34,36,4,46

												     Well, here we are, EYE Divine Cybermancy. This game is confusing. This game is hilarious. There's a lot you can say about this game, and honestly, it's hard to find what to say. And that's a good thing, because if there's so much you want to tell to someone who might play the game that you can't fit it all in a review, then it's definitely a good game. To describe why this game is so good, allow me to abridge my 100+ hours of experience in it into a short story.     As I began the game, I had no idea what I was doing. The story was so convoluted I laughed it off, I had no idea how to regenerate hp, and the menus were almost unitelligible. The entire effect was compounded by the french to english translation, which while not poor, has some funny errors. Nevertheless, I picked up a katana that zaps people so hard they explode and went huntin'.      After playing through the campaign once, hitting level 15 or so, and still feeling completely brainf$&%d, I tried out the multiplayer, joining up with my friend soon gaining a taste for blood in laggy katana combat and hilarious multi kill OHK man portable nuclear launcher shootouts. Sure, the multiplayer wasn't balanced, but that doesn't matter when you're having so much dang fun. Playing even more campaign and missions, I soon began to wonder about the gameworld itself to some extent, learning the names of creatures and weapons. And, while at first blush EYE appeared to be nothing more than a meaningless gibfest of dirty space rasta pirates and future holy space warriors with BIG ZAPPY KATANAS, I suddenly comprehended the extent of this game's universe.     Fast forward to where I am now, #1 ranked active Battle Royale player and almost level 10 in all cyber part stats, and I still don't know everything about this game (and that's not stemming from the fact that I haven't played enough campaign!) Everything in this game has an intrinsic meaning to the complex and psychological storyline, and it seems the more that I figure out about the games protagonist, the more I want to know (and fervently hope for a sequel.) This game is chock full of anything you could want from a videogame. It's got all the explosive gibs and schlock you might want from something senseless and violent, but at the same time it has a storyline with a depth that rivals some of the most thought provoking games of this generation. For 10 dollas, you can't go wrong.			",37,6,1,2,3,0,1

												This game goes on sale often, and can be bought for a dollar. Would I buy it for $10? Eh. maybe. The game is entertaining, and even though it says co op, you may end up having a lot of issues with co op.  Me and my friend did, and there are guides all over the web on how to fix it. But with those kind of guides I'm always the kind to mess them up. But, those guides are not by the devs, and they never did anything to fix the issues. So, dont expect to play co op. It ran alright with Hamachi (thats how you spell it right?) but I noticed I was lagging considerably while playing with Hamachi. I dont know if it was my friends connection or mine, although I was the host of the server. His connection wasnt the best at the time, but we havent tried recently. Everything else though, is entertaining, and I think worth the play alone. Although, Im the kind to be playing Borderlands alone. Overall I recommend it, but if you're looking for a fun co op game, I do not recommend.			",140,12,8,9,9,0,9

												An interesting game with bad execution due to a low budget and inexperienced developers.The game feels like a Source mod. (partially because it IS running on the Source engine)The story itself is interesting, but at times I felt that the character dialogue was written by an amateur or a fan fic writer.The UI is rather clunky at times and looks bad in some places due to bad usage of text color, text font and overall spacing. Not to mention, the game has received multiple updates and yet a certain bug (UI text not updating often) is not yet fixed.Some weapon/power sounds feel unsatisfying and the voice acting is weak.The use of stock Source engine sounds break immersion as well.The mapping is horrible in certain areas, not to mention that some of the maps perform badly on a considerably high-end PC. (some might say that this is because the engine is outdated or that designing a large scale map in the Source engine is hard, but I beg to differ, as I've seen outstanding maps done in Source mods or by single mappers.)The weapons are rather out of balance - at the start of the game, you have access to 2 weapons in most categories, and most categories have 1 COMPLETELY superior weapon to the other. Why bother adding 2 weapons if there are no trade-offs at all and you start out with 2 weapons in each category with one of them being completely superior to the other?Not to mention the SMGs are COMPLETELY inferior to every other weapon in every single way.The graphics are bad as well. The textures on some objects are low resolution, the bump maps on some weapons are bad and some world textures are not that pleasing for the eye either.What I did like is the depth based depth of field shader (which I haven't seen in any Valve games) and the holographic sights, but even then, it's something you see in most modern games.The game's difficulty is strange. The starting mission is easy as pie, yet the moment you get to play the first mission, you get your♥♥♥♥♥♥wrecked if you're not experienced at FPS games. (luckily that's not the case for me)This game will NOT hold your hand. It's very brutal and unforgiving. If you're a CoD kiddie, don't expect to like this game.The RPG elements, on the other hand, are nicely thought through and there are a lot of things to level up and unlock, which is very good.The gun play is robust and satisfying, although it's really ♥♥♥♥ing annoying to die because of the good ol' Source engine's physics ♥♥♥♥ing up by blocking your movement because you bumped into a prop and got stuck in it while you're getting shot at.All in all, I'd give this game a 4.5/10. I'd say that this game is a flawed gem, and if it had a bigger budget and more developers, it'd be an amazing game.Lastly, I have to admit that despite it's flaws I fell in love with this game.

												Brought this ""Diamond in the rough"" on sale for 1 buck, certaily lived up to it's name, alright. A horrible experience, no wait, i take that back, the WORST experience ever in an fps game soon ensued after i turned it on. There are so many things wrong with this game and it's made me wonder if this is still just a damn mod for hl2 or an indepedent game. It's just...bad, the control is just disgusting, the A.I is on life support, the overall HUD just felt unfinished and could probably use a belt sanders on it, yadda yadda yadda, it's bad. But not all parts of the game is mind-numbingly horrible, the dreadful piece of entertaintment still contains some neat features likes: Hacking and Remote controlling an A.I(The only reason why i beared with this thing for 2 hours), Pyshic power, Cybernetically enhanced strength for your character(A tad like Crysis with the temporal super power thing) and the genral them of the game(Grimdark and Cyberpunk have a baby).To sum it all up: Neat features and ideas, poorly executed. 6/10P.S: If you're a masochist at heart, buy this and don't bother to read the reviews. :D			",156,12,1,15,10,0,9

												This game has a lot of technical problems. And by ""a lot"" I mean ""it took me several installs and tweaks to get it working."" Once I got past that, though, I found a cool cyberpunk-inspired (albeit relatively empty) world of intrigue with an interesting visual style in front of me. In some ways, it's like Deus Ex, but its primary focus is combat rather than role-playing, and this is where it succeeds beautifully. The shooting mechanics feel just right and even the melee isn't a broken mess. Another interesting feature is the hacking minigame, which is surprisingly challenging and requires quick action and thought to succeed. If you can get past the absolutely absurd storyline, technical issues, and somewhat empty world, it's pretty solid.			",740,242,1,116,60,4,125

												why do i always get tricked by developers who go for the cyberpunk style? i'm such a huge sucker for cyberpunk games.this is one of those tales that never really got translated from french properly, and probably wasn't that good anyway. i think it's an emotion piece, but i don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about any of the dudes in power armor. the only way you can tell plot characters apart is by how fancy or stupid looking their armor is.oh, and i know that if you really shot another testosterone fuelled 'roid raging power armor friend, they would probably be quite mad, but i doubt they'd instantly turn around and fill you with bullets from their minigun.what's really irritating, is i mistakenly killed the traitor before he revealed he was a traitor on a subsequent playthrough, and failed. BUT I KNOW I HAVE TO KILL HIM TO FINISH THE LEVELit's a quirky game, with some strong points, character and generally feels like a cohesive, yet poorly lit, experience. i wouldn't recommend it though. unless you're obsessed with power armor and mysterious plots that seem to have no engaging aspects, you probably will find this dull and uninspired.

												If you ever played Dark Souls and think it's the hardest game in the world, this game will prove you wrong, and then it'll anally penetrate you with a cactus, continuously pounding you with it afterwards. That's just side missions on Normal difficulty. This game truly knows how to tell you ""♥♥♥♥ YOU"" the most harsh way possible.But oh wait, it has a higher difficulty? Not just that, on it's highest difficulty you'll die before you even see that cloaked ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the other side of the map.Other than that, it's a highly enjoyable game if you really get into it and ignore all of the faulty parts, like players twitching like druggies in co-op mode from time to time... or weapons making zero sense at some points... or your hands completely mismatching your suit... But hey, it's a Source game from 2011 and it's low budget, so chill out.No wonders it has an asian mode difficulty level though, because everything in the game is asian as ♥♥♥♥. The first character you'll meet, who actually has voice acting, will start talking gibberish. Good thing there's a massive translation text in the center when they talk though. Every single thing like an ancient scroll or hologram on a computer will also be asian or in a binary code which can't even be translated.Hacking in the game is pretty simple, but it can be annoying as hell at times.You have 5 options in hacking : ""Attack"", which deals damage to your opponent's virus, ""Mask"", which reduces your opponent's virus' damage, ""Scan"", which weakens their virus' shield, ""Shield"", which hardens your virus' shield, ""Overflow"", which trades some of your shield for some damage points.Each action in hacking takes time, and you can only pick one at once, so choose wisely.Also you can't protect yourself while hacking, so good luck trying to hack a bank dispenser while being molested by 10 semi-invincible guys with miniguns or a massive robot-demon-imp-cyborg-thing that has a cannon machinegun, which will probably instakill you.Gladly, stealth is an option in this game, which is great... for those who want to focus on that. However, you can also be a heavily armored terminator or a crazy monkey with a gun if you want, it's all up to you.Useful tips for this game :-Never ♥♥♥♥ around in the HQ/sanctuary when you're near friendly NPCs(and don't kill Jians, despite them being complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to you). Even jumping onto someone's head off a certain height will make everyone mow you down.-Play on ""Normal"" or ""Easy"" diffculty if you don't want to get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-Don't experiment with weapons on high difficulty, just go straight for the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and overpowered gun ever.-Be ready for sp00ks-Don't let anything hack you unless it's for the achievement, especially in combat zones.-Don't be too trigger happy, some NPCs are friendly in campaign mode. Even a creepy♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ing monster that's hidden in a wall.-Don't challenge heavily armored minigun guys with your sword.Oh, and remember I said this game is asian af? Yeah, also every character has blank white eyes and your mentor is an animated armored statue with a golden head. Awesome, right?			",120,7,1,4,5,0,12

												I had to replay the first level over and over and over and over again because of a crash-to-desktop without any possibility of saving the game. So, NO, I won't recommend it. In addition, I would recommend to ignore all text on screen, since it is translated in most horrible possible ways. And that is without mentionning the overly kitsch universe (some people call it original - I have to agree that such a level of kitsch in so many aspects is really rare) that you will have to cope with. I could continue on for hours on how this crap is to be avoided at all costs, but I don't feel like giving so much importance to such a terrible experience, for my own sake.

""The same dream again... I'm here... but...I don't know or remember where 'here' is.""You awake in a hazy ruin, feeling nauseousand your vision blurry. You find yourself cladin light armor plating with a small pistol and katana in your possession. You walk to the light source of the ruin; the portal, the one that brought you here... you think.E.Y.E. - DIVINE CYBERMANCYYou see the corpse of someone in moreornate armor and check the surroundings,seeing thousands of gigantic blades andkatanas embedded everywhere. You findyourself monologuing about having killedthat man on the ground, your mentor, butyou don't know why.You enter the portal and are transportedback to reality of E.Y.E. A dystopian futurewasteland inspired by Blade Runner, yousee the trappings of a familiar reality madeby Source. You report to your commander,a powerfully built man named Rimanah whois suspicious of your Mentor who is namedthe Mentor.In this hellish world, you remember howfractured and disjointed the storytelling ofDark Souls was, and this game- this realityis none the wiser. Although steeped in fog,murky shadows and drab colors, the worldof E.Y.E. finds you wanting to explore more,making you lost within its complex worldand its engaging gameplay.Finding yourself in the role of an E.Y.E.agent of the Secreta Sectorum fightingagainst the larger dominion of the strangeand ever-present Federation, the forces ofthe Culter Dei and the Jiang Shang Di, theremnants of East and West in this blastedreality have come to work together toestablish order and fight back the spawnof the Meta-streunomic Forces which havebrought the world to ruin.On every death, the HUD shows your""resurectors"" activating, even as youswear that the typo in the display isindeed deliberate. When you die andyour resurectors are spent, you findyourself standing at the portal with thethousand swords, but no Mentor, butwith a mysterious man greets you inJiang Shang Di armor, warning youcryptically that all this, all that is tocome is yet to be revealed.The first-person perspective and thelack of focus on graphics creates atense, brooding environment filled withpersonality. As you undertake missionscleaning out gangsters in nondescriptcities and uncovering that there is moreto both your Mentor and CommanderRimanah themselves, the world of E.Y.E.has not only immersed you fully within it,but has made you forget your purpose.""Starboy Coldheart."" You hear one someone call out to you asyou are about to leave on another mission for Commander Rimanah, with your rifleand the greatsword Damocles with you. The Mysterious man in your death looksat you from a distance. The HUD now presents him as ""The Nightingale"" andyou draw your sword.""In my dreams... my death... I saw you,stranger. Who are you? What are you?""The Nightingale gestures slowly, but ina way that shows he is in perfect control.""This is not your world, Coldheart. Andyou have been sidetracked here... yourmission lies elsewhere."" Puzzled, andrealizing that this 'Nightingale' knowsmore than he is letting on, you pointthe Damocles at him accusingly, youreyes narrowing.""...what DO you know of my mission?""You hiss at the Nightingale, defensiveand afraid of the truth that you haveforgotten since arriving in this world.""That Summer-Rain is still out there...and that you seek a chance to bewith her again."" The Nightingale nowwhirls his staff, and in a blink, the E.Y.E.fortress is no more and the ruin of thethousands swords and the portal greetsyou again. ""Starboy Coldheart..."" TheNightingale begins, readying his staffto fight you- ""You must leave... youcannot finish E.Y.E.""You pull back the Damocles to readyyourself against The Nightingale, yourresponse a shout. ""NO! I AM AN AGENTOF THE CULTER DEI! I WILL FIND THETRUTH OF E.Y.E.!""You charge and meet with him, TheNightingale; in combat, his mysteriousstaff channelling the Meta-streunomicforces against the technological mightof the Damocles. The vicious duel lastsmere moments, before The Nightingaleuses the Meta-streunomic force tooverpower and send you hurtling intothe portal.""I do this for your own good, StarboyColdheart... you are needed elsewhere.To finish E.Y.E. is folly."" The Nightingalewarns again, walking to you as you holdon to the edges of the portal, your handand face the only parts of you still withinthe world of E.Y.E. ""I can do this. I canstop the Meta-strunomic force before itdestroys everything!""The Nightingale readies his staff to hityour hand away to send you into onlywhat the Gods know. ""No, StarboyColdheart. You have never understood.The Meta-streunomic force has neverdestroyed..."" With a swing, you feel your hand let go as the staff hits and sends you into the portal fully, The lastwords of the Nightingale ringing in yourears. ""...only changed.

												A game that's a mod of half life 2.It's really rough in a lot of places: The translation and complexity of the lore text is awful, unfinished and generally rushed.The stats system doesn't have a strong enough impact on the game, I put loads into hacking and it was still challenging instead of easy.If you don't grind and pick certain upgrades for your class early like cloak or dermal shielding you can get really far into the game without realising you are crippled and it takes a lot more effort to win.The games ending was rushed and ridiculous with a werewolf throwing out sentences like a child would do to explain whats happened in a hurry.Lots of large areas in the maps containing nothing at all, except lots of walking.I can't recommend this game to anyone as it's a rough, unfinished product.

												surprised i never wrote a review on this.you can do the entire campaign co-op.  only bad thing is only one player initiates\talks to the important NPC, all your co-op buddies can do is just tag along for the killing.  co-op with any server lan stuffs you can.  As of this review theres only like... 5 publicservers left online for anyone to freely join.very strange neat game.  mostly shooter, partial hacking, magic, melee-ing, explosives mayhemthe hit boxes are extremely hard vs moving targets (unless you using explosives)campaign is very replayable due to multiple endings n pathways etc.  Plus you can kill everything you meet.  if its campaign advancement NPCs you kill, you'll hafta restart the level depending on when ya kill an important fellow.oh and there is a yummy learning curve.  every time you die is a chance of perma stats reduction (until later on... or not depending on the random loot you gain fighting)it has a Random generating for enemies and loot they drop when you replay levels later on. Which is why i've invested so much time in this accursed game.  I've gotten 98% loot possible, and i need the remaining 2% to unlock the 'cannon' weapon of the game!?!			",325,75,2,33,12,0,32

												A poor man's deus exPros-Relatively cheap download and buy-Captures the sci-fi dystopia atmosphere-Reminds me of 'Deus Ex'-Fun shooter-RPG Elements-You can play this game in a various amount of ways-Skill tree-Fun played co-op-A whole collection of gunsCons-Bugs-Frustrating and weak A.I.-It has some bugs-Its user interface is bad-You're a machine-The bugs really ruin this game-I don't enjoy reading dialogue (of english) while they are speaking a language which  I don't understand (unless its jap)-Some bugs here and there-The learning curve Overall, this game isn't bad. I mean its already a cheap download so I can't really expect too much from it but from what I have played the game is good enough for me to recommend it to my friends. I mean, incase you haven't realised there are some bugs. Like in the beginning I picked up the gun, then I logged out and later went back on, it started back all the way in the beginning but this time I actually had the gun. If you're a deus ex fan or you see this on sale, pick this up. Even with all the bugs and other crap, its still good, it impresses me to give a recommendation through its amazing atmosphere, RPG elements and sci-fi setting.Rating: Pick it up, sometime in your life. As I mentioned before it does have a lot of bugs yes but its gameplay elements, RPG elements greatly exceed those.Final Verdict: 6.9/10 ",247,36,1,17,13,2,17

												One day I woke up with a thought: 'I want new shooting type game' and later I saw this one is on a sale... EYE is one of the wrst games I've ever seen. RPG part is far too complex, while it is hard to figure out how do all stats work. There is info about it in game but very short. As well as in game movie-type tutorial doesnt help more than just clicking and watching.Very anoying is lack of 'save'. Especialy that game somehow doesnt remeber when I talk to a NPC important in story line.Fight itself is also not my type. Unless distance is huge (I mean HUGE) all enemy instantly know player's location. It is like being on a pan.I won't write about graphics because it is not what I think is most important.

												A very confusing yet fun cyberpunk shooter to play. Originally playing it back during release in 2011, it was a buggy mess full of broken translations and glitches that had further convoluted the game even worse than the present version. Over time, these issues were ironed out but the game still remains a very confusing yet enjoyable experience.This game is primary a FPS with character leveling, allowing your character to grow even stronger as you continue to play through the title. You start off as a rather weak soldier, but as both your character levels up and you gain more experience playing the game, you will end up as a cybernetic powerhouse able to take on entire groups of heavily armored enemies in both gratuitous flair and efficiency. Generally all the weapons here outside of a few are generally worth using, much like an RPG you'll unlock more weapons and equipment as you level up and earn more money.The story is both one of the greatest and worst things in this game. This game doesn't give you all the information outright and only gives small pieces every so often and the player is expected to piece all of this together over time. This can be a turnoff for some players used to more modern games that by the end of the playthrough, there is nothing new to learn or find out even in NG+. To the players that are patient enough to piece it all together, you do get a mostly intact yet shattered picture of the game, the factions and so on.The campaign of the game is one of the high points with this game for me. You can do the campaign both in singleplayer and in coop, and unlike what the game description says you can have up to 32 people in one campaign. It's a fairly short campaign in comparison to other games, but requires NG+++ in order to 100% the campaign. When you get a group of people together to play through the campaign, it's something magical that reminds me of playing a Serious Sam title in Co-Op mode. There are other multiplayer modes such as a CTF like mode with classes and a round based deathmatch mode for multiplayer, but the multiplayer for campaign is overall a more solid experience than these.In short, it's a fantastic yet confusing  FPS that is especially fun with friends. Typically it goes on sale anywhere from $1.00-$2.50 which is well worth it at this pricetag.			",391,31,42,31,70,3,63

												There's not much that can out-cyberpunk a game in which you can hack the phantom memories of a dead person's brain and, should you fail, get counterhack-attacked by the ICE he had installed. Mind you, this wasn't in the story campaign, this was a randomly generated mission that popped up while I was messing around on one of the maps. The game makes no sense, is extremely user unfriendly, poorly translated, has a trial-and-error steep learning curve, most of the achievements are completely random and your legs are always broken. But I'll recommend it forever and always for the brouzouf.			",537,177,27,83,65,9,61

												surprised i never wrote a review on this.you can do the entire campaign co-op.  only bad thing is only one player initiates\talks to the important NPC, all your co-op buddies can do is just tag along for the killing.  co-op with any server lan stuffs you can.  As of this review theres only like... 5 publicservers left online for anyone to freely join.very strange neat game.  mostly shooter, partial hacking, magic, melee-ing, explosives mayhemthe hit boxes are extremely hard vs moving targets (unless you using explosives)campaign is very replayable due to multiple endings n pathways etc.  Plus you can kill everything you meet.  if its campaign advancement NPCs you kill, you'll hafta restart the level depending on when ya kill an important fellow.oh and there is a yummy learning curve.  every time you die is a chance of perma stats reduction (until later on... or not depending on the random loot you gain fighting)it has a Random generating for enemies and loot they drop when you replay levels later on. Which is why i've invested so much time in this accursed game.  I've gotten 98% loot possible, and i need the remaining 2% to unlock the 'cannon' weapon of the game!?!			",325,75,2,33,12,0,32

												This game can be boring to start, but once you get to the first city it changes a lot (maybe 15-20min of gameplay), shooting is not so good, and you have to shoot all the time, enemies respawn constantly. To get the real ending, you have to finish the game two times, that was the only frustrating thing for me.But there are some features which make this game so unique in cyberpunk genre: abilities, weird hacking process, sophisticated lore and storyline, dark and mysterious atmosphere. There is also some online co-op and pvp which i haven't tried because was too busy with the story.And all made by independent company.Enjoyed this game immensely,			",381,104,3,41,26,0,11

												This game is great. It has a wide set of weapons and abilities that allow you to specialise however you want. There is a storyline, but I'm yet to figure out what it actually is. Half the game is spent wondering what you're actually doing, but that's the funnest thing about it! Co-op is just as fun, if not more confusing. Buy it; it's not expensive, and you'll have a blast trying to figure out what's happening.			",101,16,0,20,15,0,5

Graphics resembling the original halflife and an AI that is somehow laughably stupid (You can rampage through and entire level with a Para-type weapon and the enemies at the end will still be cluelessly patroling) and yet still beyond frustrating (You can sneak on to a roof yet every sniper within a thousand yards will know you are there and hit you with lasers that prevent you from aiming) .

YouTube™ Video: Well that's about enough life... - JonTron 

			Views: 250,567		

			...for me for one day. *From JonTron's review of Birdemic.*		

Actual Review:This game is very fun to play if you can get past all of the problems with the game.Pros: Very nice RPG elements, including skill trees, class systems, character generation, and even a very in depth hacking mini game. Nice gunplay and mostly intelegent AI, including flushing you out, flanking, etc. Lots of replayability due to the many skills and playstyles, (hacker, stealth, running and gunning, etc.) Awesome guns and even a sword that makes stuff explode. Extremely fun multiplayer. Pretty decent music, (but I mean, I couldn't do better).Cons: Really bad translations. Very bad balance between playstyles. It is EXTREMELY confusing to start, and for that reason I recommend reading a character generation guide.I personally think that the pros outweigh the cons, since as long as you can stick with the game it is very fun.Also blood games looks pretty cool, but I wouldn't know.

												So I hear that some people don't like this game, but I don't really understand why. Most likely they're expecting it to be a different type of game, but it's basically an RPG style mod for an FPS game. That's what it is and what it's supposed to be. In my opinion it's pretty successful at this.The main problems with the game are relatively minor, like the font size is too small for modern displays and there's no way to increase it. There are some other minor UI type issues that basicaly seem to stem from the fact that it's an FPS engine mod being sold as a game, and from the fact that the game is a bit dated.The art style in the game is great though. It's basically a combo between the Necromongers from the Riddick movies and the usual cybrpunk stuff (hacking, implants, etc.) The overall level design isn't amazing but it isn't too bad. (It sort of looks like maybe someone designed the levels without too much regard to what quests would be in those levels or how they'd work, then the quest/mission content was added later.) So the levels don't naturally lead you toward quest objectives, but this could be good or bad depening on whether you want your hand held or you want a more realistic experience. (Quest markers exist, but they don't necessarily lead you easily to a waypoint because the actual path you need to take to get there may be kind of convoluted. However there is a ""spell"" that does pathfinding toward the next quest marker.)In short, it's a unique RPG FPS game with a few rough edges in the UI, and it's kind of dated at this point, but it's cetainly worth picking up especially on sale. If you want CS:GO don't buy it, but if you want a uniqe FPS RPG with a cyberpunk psionic necromonger type theme and don't mind that its an older game then do buy it especially since it's inexpensive.

												This game is a hybrid of First Person Shooters and Tabletop RPG's. Like a tabletop, you need a little reading, friends and patience to get the fullest out of this game.Conceptually, EYE is basically Deus Ex meets the Imperium of Man. You've got some pretty good gun play, mixed with tabletop conventions like having skill points, rolling critical hits and critical misses, and permanent stat reductions for dying in an embarrassing way.  Like Deus Ex, you can run and gun or stealth your way around the environment, but more akin to tabletops you can also hack other enemies and machines to do your bidding or even be a psychic cyber samurai.As far as I can understand it, the story takes place in a distant far flung future where everything and everyone is computerized to the point where there’s almost no organic madder inside anybody anymore. You work for EYE, a secret agent army working for a mysterious megacorp, fighting against everything from other megacorp armies to the feds (who look like Helghast) to lawless bandits by various means of sabotage, subterfuge and sometimes strait up pop’ in dudes.The entire game can be played in coop for up to 4 players (It’s actually 32 players, but good luck with that) and should very much be played like that. Think of it like D&D, one wizard venturing forth isn’t all that great and pretty hard, but if you have a party of four with varied strengths and weaknesses, you can overcome your enemies as a team.The game may seem overly complex and janky at first, but as you learn your way around and excuse the♥♥♥♥♥♥translation, you’ll have a blast with having cyborg ninja adventures with your friends. Just be careful not to overdose.Here's a mod for a better translationHere's a guide on character generation and mechanics ",250,40,6,18,12,2,25

												If you're looking for a game with a ""plot"" or a ""coherent storyline"" or even ""charecter development"" you should probably look somewhere else.If you want to blow up werewolves with an exploding katana in a Cyberpunk-but-not-really setting, levels built like Gmod RP cities, 32 player Co-Op, Dakka and more Dakka, and poorly translated ""hip ghetto slang""... then your search is over.11/10 would gain Brouzouf again.

												Fundamentally a cool idea, but in practice, a confusing and unwieldy mess. There's all sorts of neat stuff you can ostensibly do, but when it comes time to actually do it, you'll be too busy blundering about trying to figure out where the ♥♥♥♥ you are, which way to go, and what you're supposed to be doing, let alone what buttons to press or menus to go into, to accomplish much. The rot goes deep; I doubt it's within the reach of any amount of patching to fix. Unless you're really desperate for cyberpunk dystopia, I'd give it a skip.			",150,23,1,21,21,1,21

												I really tried to like this, but it just bored the hell out of me and I couldn't get more than 3 hours or so into it.  The controls are also sloppy, even when I mapped them to my liking, and the perks and leveling system isn't well explained and shrouded in the games lore to its detriment (and researching what things mean in-game is a convoluted chore.  Tooltips would have been awesome).  Maybe the game picks up as you get deeper, but that I may never know (unless I really need to cure a case of bad insomnia).  You're better off just dropping a couple extra bucks and going for Deus Ex:HR.			",202,84,2,18,11,3,27

												This is an interesting game to say the least. Lots of RPG mechanics built into an FPS that uses Half Life gun mechanics. The AI slider bars are pretty innacurate since it seems no matter what you set it to they still see/hear you from a mile away.The multiplayer can be fun but experianced players have an intense advantage over newbies especially if you havent played through the main campaign. The graphic style is interesting and the storyline is actually unique however a lot of the maps ive seen feel empty. The objective system is pretty nice (I personally enjoyed assassination missions) and allows for open ended gameplay.Graphics: 6/10Gameplay: 6/10Story: 6/10Replay Value: 3/10Overall Rating: 4/10			",152,39,3,27,15,1,9

												Wouldn't recommend it even for FPS-RPG aficionados. One of my worst purchases. And to think I was actually anxious to play this one...There are several systems such as sneaking, hacking, but they are all broken, no exceptions. The game is pretty easy if you stop trying to be original and go straight out head-clicking as in any other FPS out there and ignore the RPG part, go with the obvious.The storyline is best part of the game, but not enough to compensate horrible gameplay.I know there is only 1h listed, but I played this game a lot offline, and have over 6hrs played. I tried it.			",323,84,5,56,49,4,56

												So, this is one of those it's a steam sale and it look interesting buys. As it was only a few dollars and it seemed like something new to play that I might start up every now and again for something new. Starting it up the graphics weren't anything to be thrilled with, but if it's a good game you don't have to have HD textrues. Plus, for a game type like this it's not really needed or the most important quality. Now I want to preface everything in this review with the simple fact that I only played it around an hour of the game.This game when you first start it up starts to seems like it's one of those games that slips through the cracks and is a hidden gem. Though right after it started to try and teach me how to use some of your basic special abilities I was confused. As what it tells you to click and where to go doesn't always match up with what you need to do. So you just get a view of all of the massive amount of skills/abilites you can have, without having even any solid knowlage of how to use the basic skills. This doesn't even include the charcter creation section where you choose what three gene types you want to splice together with a vage idea of what atruibutes fit your play style. Then when the tutorial promp pops up to have you click the video for what it wants you to do. What it tells you to do isn't the same as what the video is called so you spend a few moments guessing and hopping you click the correct one.So, once you get past the tutorial and actually start to kill people it doesn't hold your hand on how to get to the objective. Which I actually liked, but there where so many options that it just kinda felt like none of them were fully fleshed out so to say. As if there were too many ideas just thrown together when ended up with something stand alone, but it's so much at once you don't know what you are doing or how some skills work. As well as feeling like everything was half finished before they added on new features and abilites. There is also the issue that it really likes to lag and glitch from time to time which happens much too frequently to be something that I can just ignore and keep playing. As it got to the point a few times that it just kept me from doing anything.Also, there are so many menus to go though that it feels more like it was made for a console/controler then a keyboard with the ability to lessen the amount of menus. By menus, I mean menus with in menus. Not just a lot of seperate menues.Over all, this is a really intresting game and you might like or even love it. Though you will really need to devote time to this game to figure out how everything works, but I couldn't as there were just too much meh feeling about it.			",211,29,2,40,42,1,33

												A very confusing yet fun cyberpunk shooter to play. Originally playing it back during release in 2011, it was a buggy mess full of broken translations and glitches that had further convoluted the game even worse than the present version. Over time, these issues were ironed out but the game still remains a very confusing yet enjoyable experience.This game is primary a FPS with character leveling, allowing your character to grow even stronger as you continue to play through the title. You start off as a rather weak soldier, but as both your character levels up and you gain more experience playing the game, you will end up as a cybernetic powerhouse able to take on entire groups of heavily armored enemies in both gratuitous flair and efficiency. Generally all the weapons here outside of a few are generally worth using, much like an RPG you'll unlock more weapons and equipment as you level up and earn more money.The story is both one of the greatest and worst things in this game. This game doesn't give you all the information outright and only gives small pieces every so often and the player is expected to piece all of this together over time. This can be a turnoff for some players used to more modern games that by the end of the playthrough, there is nothing new to learn or find out even in NG+. To the players that are patient enough to piece it all together, you do get a mostly intact yet shattered picture of the game, the factions and so on.The campaign of the game is one of the high points with this game for me. You can do the campaign both in singleplayer and in coop, and unlike what the game description says you can have up to 32 people in one campaign. It's a fairly short campaign in comparison to other games, but requires NG+++ in order to 100% the campaign. When you get a group of people together to play through the campaign, it's something magical that reminds me of playing a Serious Sam title in Co-Op mode. There are other multiplayer modes such as a CTF like mode with classes and a round based deathmatch mode for multiplayer, but the multiplayer for campaign is overall a more solid experience than these.In short, it's a fantastic yet confusing  FPS that is especially fun with friends. Typically it goes on sale anywhere from $1.00-$2.50 which is well worth it at this pricetag.			",391,31,42,31,70,3,63

												There's not much that can out-cyberpunk a game in which you can hack the phantom memories of a dead person's brain and, should you fail, get counterhack-attacked by the ICE he had installed. Mind you, this wasn't in the story campaign, this was a randomly generated mission that popped up while I was messing around on one of the maps. The game makes no sense, is extremely user unfriendly, poorly translated, has a trial-and-error steep learning curve, most of the achievements are completely random and your legs are always broken. But I'll recommend it forever and always for the brouzouf.			",537,177,27,83,65,9,61

												surprised i never wrote a review on this.you can do the entire campaign co-op.  only bad thing is only one player initiates\talks to the important NPC, all your co-op buddies can do is just tag along for the killing.  co-op with any server lan stuffs you can.  As of this review theres only like... 5 publicservers left online for anyone to freely join.very strange neat game.  mostly shooter, partial hacking, magic, melee-ing, explosives mayhemthe hit boxes are extremely hard vs moving targets (unless you using explosives)campaign is very replayable due to multiple endings n pathways etc.  Plus you can kill everything you meet.  if its campaign advancement NPCs you kill, you'll hafta restart the level depending on when ya kill an important fellow.oh and there is a yummy learning curve.  every time you die is a chance of perma stats reduction (until later on... or not depending on the random loot you gain fighting)it has a Random generating for enemies and loot they drop when you replay levels later on. Which is why i've invested so much time in this accursed game.  I've gotten 98% loot possible, and i need the remaining 2% to unlock the 'cannon' weapon of the game!?!			",325,75,2,33,12,0,32

												This game is amazing. It's a cyber-steampunk indie game that if you play alone, you're gonna have a bad time. It's alot of fun. It plays out seperately each time I've played it. Granted at one point the game becomes more survival than RPG. There are so many aspects of RPG although character customization is.. well. lemme put it this way, if you've never ever ever played morrowind, you'll never understand the ammount of tiny adjustments the customization screen is. but this game is awesome I recommend. 10/10 would buy again			",100,12,0,15,9,0,3

Swords are fun and it looks pretty  and dual-weilding swords and pistols is probably the best thing that has ever been put in a game since like the Skylines in Bioshock Infinite. Controls are wonky, like I wouldnt ever think to hit ENTER to use items, and powers and sometimes moving can be weird too.  ",103,7,2,7,3,1,11

												Ever play a tabletop game of Shadowrun or Warhammer 40K and find yourself asking ""Wouldn't this be awesome if I took some  LSD and played this as a video game?"" If so you are the target audience for one of the most underrated games of the decade. The game has to be played to be believed as it is a very odd FPS/RPG Hybrid with an odd plot, strange characters, and all the anime-esque cyberpunk katana wielding hacker action you can stomach. It is the closest we've gotten to a modern equivilent to Deus Ex.			",202,14,0,24,17,1,49

												Overview:   A great cyberpunk RPG. Don't expect to be able to follow the storyline without outside sources as all dialogue in the game is written in some language not yet seen to humankind and risen from the deepest pits of the nine hells. Also, some of it is in French and untranslated. The Storyline:    EYE's storyline is incomprehensible. None of it makes sense, and it isn't supposed to. There is an underlying storyline that is impossible to notice without venturing into the dark pits of the EYE forums that is only discernible if you manage to understand the dialogue which would require some form of extra-universal 10th dimensional being to assist you. The main storyline revolves around you, a futuristic Cyborg-Templar-Inquisitor. Your character is a member of a Templar-ish space wizard order who recently fractured and now theres also Ninja Space Wizards as well. You mainly fight against 'The Federation' a type of dystopian space government that has no real motives or beliefs behind their actions, and you're never told why you're attacking them. You also combat space-werewolf lizardmen xenomorphs called 'meta-streumonic creatures.'    Most of characters you meet are prone to excessive bouts of mood shifts and are generally mentally unstable. Also you have amnesia, and people get mad when you ask them about things your character should know, but that you donts because its never explained to you. Your character also has a wife, who is mentioned once, but never again, and is never seen. The final boss fight makes no sense and I have no idea why I was even fighting him. Also, there are Space-Jamaican Pirates on Mars.   At the beginning of the game you're told that some captain sent his wife into the forbidden place and she was executed as result. That captain was you. Then you went insane because you basically killed your wife. None of the events in the game actually happen, and your character is actually just living some kind of screwed up nightmare which kind of explains why nothing in the game makes any sense. 10 / 10 would recommendtl;dr  version:you gain brouzoufyou gain brouzoufmy legs are OKyou gain brouzouf ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So, this is one of those it's a steam sale and it look interesting buys. As it was only a few dollars and it seemed like something new to play that I might start up every now and again for something new. Starting it up the graphics weren't anything to be thrilled with, but if it's a good game you don't have to have HD textrues. Plus, for a game type like this it's not really needed or the most important quality. Now I want to preface everything in this review with the simple fact that I only played it around an hour of the game.This game when you first start it up starts to seems like it's one of those games that slips through the cracks and is a hidden gem. Though right after it started to try and teach me how to use some of your basic special abilities I was confused. As what it tells you to click and where to go doesn't always match up with what you need to do. So you just get a view of all of the massive amount of skills/abilites you can have, without having even any solid knowlage of how to use the basic skills. This doesn't even include the charcter creation section where you choose what three gene types you want to splice together with a vage idea of what atruibutes fit your play style. Then when the tutorial promp pops up to have you click the video for what it wants you to do. What it tells you to do isn't the same as what the video is called so you spend a few moments guessing and hopping you click the correct one.So, once you get past the tutorial and actually start to kill people it doesn't hold your hand on how to get to the objective. Which I actually liked, but there where so many options that it just kinda felt like none of them were fully fleshed out so to say. As if there were too many ideas just thrown together when ended up with something stand alone, but it's so much at once you don't know what you are doing or how some skills work. As well as feeling like everything was half finished before they added on new features and abilites. There is also the issue that it really likes to lag and glitch from time to time which happens much too frequently to be something that I can just ignore and keep playing. As it got to the point a few times that it just kept me from doing anything.Also, there are so many menus to go though that it feels more like it was made for a console/controler then a keyboard with the ability to lessen the amount of menus. By menus, I mean menus with in menus. Not just a lot of seperate menues.Over all, this is a really intresting game and you might like or even love it. Though you will really need to devote time to this game to figure out how everything works, but I couldn't as there were just too much meh feeling about it.			",211,29,2,40,42,1,33

												Have you ever wanted to play a gun-toting, sword-wielding, cyborg knight with the force caught up in a corporate war?EYE is not for everyone, but if you've ever wondered what it would be like if in-depth Morrowind-style RPG mechanics got mixed up with Half-Life 2's FPS mechanics, and the whole mix were turned up to eleven, buy this game.In one mission I got overwhelmed by monsters and my character snapped under the pressure. I had to run like a sissy while my character fired his weapon uncontrollably at shadows and hallucinated explosions.In another, I accidentally got caught in crossfire between some allies and the enemy forces, and my character freaked out and hallucinated that my allies were the bad guys.I tried to hack a security console and it hacked me back.I overused my psionic powers and my head exploded.---This game does have issues. If you like to have allies (this game lets you conjure them with sci fi magic), you'll find they get in the way quite often, especially in cramped areas. If you head back into an area outside of that area's mission, you'll find that enemies are set to respawn very frequently, which is not everyone's cup of tea. You can tweak the AI settings and respawn rates in the options menu, but not quite enough for some areas. As many people mention, the English translation in this game is poor, but there's a community-made patch that fixes most of that. Sound quality can be hit and miss, but on the whole the gunplay sounds satisfying. Sadly there is very little voice acting in this game! The bulk of all interaction you'll have with NPCs is done through text.---If you're willing to deal with that and you want a game with excellent gunplay, hardcore RPG mechanics, and inventory management, that overwhelms you with options and makes absolutely no apologies for its learning curve and occasionally brutal difficulty, pick this game up. If you're unsure whether this is your cup of tea, I encourage you to at least watch a Let's Play and check out the demo. This game will definitely be sucking up a lot of my time.6/10 without community grammar patch, 8/10 with.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Where to start? I don't want to say that this game is terrible, but...it's awful. Don't get me wrong, there are a LOT of really good concepts in this game. Head trauma, limb wounds (though some of those seem to be thrown around at random with no real cause) bleeding out from wounds. The cybertech is all fairly cool, but that seems to more or less only apply to long-running multiplayer servers or single player, though to be honest, ♥♥♥♥ if I could tell what was going on half the time because of the horrible, rampant Engrish. The single player campaign seems like an afterthought, cooked up by a sweatshop worker on his breaks between contemplating his lack of shoes and staring at those steam pipes.One of the good points of the game, however, is that you have the absolute freedom to attack and kill anything. And I mean ANYTHING. Enemy? Sweet. Helpless animal? Go right ahead. Non-essential NPC? Blow him away! Essential NPC? NOBODY IS SAFE! However, the poorly designed interface makes it so hard to tell friend from foe that I spent half of the time running from my friends popping cyberclonespell or whatever it was and trying to find the next armory. The Armory system is by far one of the best systems in the game, combining inventory tetris from Diablo and the carry weight from Fallout. Good game? No. Good B-game? Ooooh yeah.

												So I hear that some people don't like this game, but I don't really understand why. Most likely they're expecting it to be a different type of game, but it's basically an RPG style mod for an FPS game. That's what it is and what it's supposed to be. In my opinion it's pretty successful at this.The main problems with the game are relatively minor, like the font size is too small for modern displays and there's no way to increase it. There are some other minor UI type issues that basicaly seem to stem from the fact that it's an FPS engine mod being sold as a game, and from the fact that the game is a bit dated.The art style in the game is great though. It's basically a combo between the Necromongers from the Riddick movies and the usual cybrpunk stuff (hacking, implants, etc.) The overall level design isn't amazing but it isn't too bad. (It sort of looks like maybe someone designed the levels without too much regard to what quests would be in those levels or how they'd work, then the quest/mission content was added later.) So the levels don't naturally lead you toward quest objectives, but this could be good or bad depening on whether you want your hand held or you want a more realistic experience. (Quest markers exist, but they don't necessarily lead you easily to a waypoint because the actual path you need to take to get there may be kind of convoluted. However there is a ""spell"" that does pathfinding toward the next quest marker.)In short, it's a unique RPG FPS game with a few rough edges in the UI, and it's kind of dated at this point, but it's cetainly worth picking up especially on sale. If you want CS:GO don't buy it, but if you want a uniqe FPS RPG with a cyberpunk psionic necromonger type theme and don't mind that its an older game then do buy it especially since it's inexpensive.

												THIS IS THE CRAZIEST SOURCEMOD EVER CREATED IN THE HISTORY OF MAN.Install the improved translation mod before you do anything -at all- with this game. Play as a rambo character and become overpowered first before specializing in hacking or psi powers.If games were like alcohol, EYE is like a terrible-tasting and mysterious throat-burning whiskey that also makes you hallucinate and you have no idea what is even happening, but it is awful and amazing at the same time. The balance of the game is absolutely horrendous. Stealth, hacking and psionic builds will be hard-pressed to gain any experience, money or leverage at all; If you are not a ghost-in-the-shell holocaust murder agent you are the equivalent of someone with an english major.The only way to make money or gain experience efficiently is to kill hundreds and hundreds of enemies or speedrun side missions, which could take up to an hour. The maps are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly huge and are designed to be labyrinths. The maps are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥LY XBOX HUGE. It takes maybe 5 minutes to run from point A to point B, where dozens of high-level enemies constantly spawn close to you and make it impossible to catch a break or to heal yourself. Always upgrade your cyber legs.The AI is actually kind of smart and very vicious; they will throw grenades, rush you, corner you and flank you for any chance they get; when there is a 6-story tall cyberdemon only inches between you and a foot soldier, you are still enemy number one. If you dislike constant long-range combat, modify it such that enemies will only notice you at shorter distances and you'll have an easier time with both stealth and gunplay.Besides all of that, this game has an overwhelmingly chaotic atmosphere, very well-done dystopian aesthetics, and swarms upon swarms of enemies that present a constant threat and danger throughout the game. The developers crammed so many elements into the game that an invisible rambo super-fast armored gunslinging cyborg ninja who hacks into people's brains, uses psionic powers and jumps 6 feet into the air is UNDERPOWERED.Cons: Bad translation, incomprehensible to the layman, horrible balance, STUPIDLY GIGANTIC XBOX HUGE MAPS (I cannot stress this enough), no tutorials, a few bullet sponge enemies and a punishing autosave system.Pros: It will all be worth it if you want your head to explode from all of the chaos. I still have PTSD from the Mars mission. This game leaves me wordless to say what really went on in my mind when every element culminated into blasting down helicopters and cyberdemons the size of grand canyons left and right.

												TL;DR:A mashup of Warhammer 40k, Shadowrun, and Deus Ex. The ingredients are right for a perfectly cooked masterpiece, but you have to eat it with chop sticks. Hard at first, but fun once you get the hang of it. Also now a days when it goes on sale it's now only $1, so you can't go wrong.Pre-face:Right now before I get into the meat of this, this game currently has a horrible tutorial for its mechanics and was impossible for me to get into the first time I picked it up, but...Interesting Tidbits:From last I heard the development house has gone through some rough patches. With people up and disapearing from work, and certain complications. Right now the game can be seen as incomplete, but it is a hidden gem of a game.Pros:(+++) Point for point customization (Inventory Tetris, Augmentations, Psionic Powers, Hacking, Cybermancy)(+++) Nitty gritty cyberpunk done right(++) Multiple paths to victory in a given objective(+) You can have special eyes(+) On sale it goes for almost nothing(+?) Tons of complexity (Note, the complexity is the currency with which you buy depth)Cons:(---) No true ending(---) Terrible explination of how the game works (I'm looking at you research)(---) game crippling mistakes that can ruin playthroughs (Dying with low Karma can incure persistent debuffs to stats without expensive research)(--) No more then 3 weapons of a given class(--) Enemy AI is lack luster at times(-) The game is sadly as is. The chance of a update is almost non-existent.Tips:WIKI WIKI WIKI, people have made your life easy. Don't be afraid to make mistakes at first, we all restarted at some point to remake our characters.The heavy sniper can shoot through walls, have fun.Conclusion:A experience akin to the original Deus Ex, little to no handholding. Character customization closer to pen and paper table top games. Play any character you can think of in this world. Sadly despite all these things, I can ignore the obvious faults. Not as bad as the hundreds of pages I had to read in Dungeons and Dragons, but a hefty time investment. If you are iffy on this title wait for a sale to take it down to a couple of dollars, and give it a spin.			",139,24,1,31,10,1,40

												How would one describe this game to a gamer unaware of it's existence and is looking for something new and is interested in what your have to say about it. Well, luckily you now know about this game seeing as how you maybe reading this review so that's a plus. So I'm going to write a review based off the idea the person reading it hasn't seen any trailers or gameplay videos, and hasn't had the story or world explained to them.This game lookes better then most that came out that same year. For an Indie title that's impressive. As for the gameplay... it's unique yet familiar. You have your FPS/RPG style game. You jump, crouch, shoot, aim down the sights, you have an inventory with VERY limited space so there's no bottomless pockets on your armor, you get to choose your loadout from a very good number of possibilites. You can mix up have one sword or three, dual-weilding both swords and pistols, you can have submachine gunes, assault rifles, sniper rifles, shotguns, a minigun, and a sword that makes people explode when you hit them with it. Grenades, med kits, and at some point you can purchase turrets. I found the ""speed malus"" intriguing. Instead of just having limited space (which you do) how much you carry on you and the weight of each individual item will slow your base movement speed. This also applies to the three different armor types you can have (light, medium, heavy). You also get powers in this game. The story takes place in the future. I don't know how far but it's pretty damn far in my opinion. And your a part of a cult of cyborg wizards... I'm serious. OKay more accurately a secret organization that deals with weird things that are created from your worst nightmares and brought to a physical form in our realm. There's also civil issues with a government group and a rival ""cult"" apart of the same organization as you. But that's all I'm going to give away. Back to the powers. You can create clones, of which you can slaughter at your behest but becareful cuase you can lose mental stats which do actually effect you in this game. You don't want to be some cyborg wizard with no sanity to speak of do you? Anyway, you can teleport to an enemies position making them explode into pieces and your end up taking there spot in line at the local alien MCDonalds. There's tech abilities as well as your weird magic abilities like the ones I just described. You can cloak, sprint faster and jump higher (similar to the Crysis game but you get faster and jump higher as your stats increase as well so eventually you'll be jumping around like Alex Mercer, or the Hulk for those of you who don't know about the game Prototype) you can get a special vision that helps you target enemies and see anybody who might be cloaked, and you can perform maintanence on yourself if you get message saying you've got a broken leg or something. I told you that you were a cyborg wizard.Anyway one of the things I find most interesting about this game is the research aspect and the upgrades to your body that you can make. Now there was a reviewer who said not to expect Deus Ex and quite frankly other then this part I'm about to explain I don't know why you would, Deus Ex was about the controversy and challenges of living in a world where you could enhance your body and become part machine where E.Y.E is about... well I'm still not entire sure I haven't gotten that far yet. SO! There are objects you find while traveling that help you research for new alloys and upgrades, although I will admit it's been awhile since I've played and even then I didn't fully understand how it worked but I know that researching is necessary. IT's cool to because it'll give you a time of how long it'll take to complete the research how you can speed it up by spending money on the research. Now the part that is somewhat similar to Deus Ex is that you can upgrade individual parts of your cyborg wizard to improve his performance. For example, putting funds into upgrading your eyes will help your accuarcy and reduce the effects of flash bangs and other such quirks. Upgrading your legs again makes your run faster and jump higher. Improving your body will make you take less damage and you can upgrade your brain so your better at hacking. Yes you can also hack just about anything in this game. Enemies and there turrets, security systems, doors, you name it. The hacking aspect is like a fast paced mini-startegy game.I can't possibly explain everything in this review nor do I want to but that is a lot of the aspects of the game in what four paragraphs? Anyway I recommend this game it's fairly enjoyable and it doesn't hold your hand. Oh and I almost forgot to mention enemies will send reinforcements to an area so standing around isn't a good idea. Also, another fun fact is you can change the difficulty of the game and the rate at which enemy reinforcements arrive to the area your in. Anyway have fun.			",258,28,0,34,4,1,22

												Like all other reviews before this and surely those to be written in the future, this game has it's flaws. Certainly you're enticed by its cyberpunk themes and I don't blame you. I know I was. It's good fun, when you get about 3-4 hours in. The initial response to this game is one of overwhelming confusion and anger as you find yourself getting gimped in some cheap ways, shot at from across the map, or the scores of enemies who attack to no end. Build your character up a bit, and you'll start to see the game shine. I know I am, and having a damn good time.			",38,1,0,1,0,0,0

												This is a game that can easily be described as a poor man's Deus Ex. It's short, it's dumb, it's hard to follow, and it looks ok at best. But there's a massive degree of freedom that this game just throws at you right off the back and an incredibly deep level of complexity to the way you kit out your character with guns, cybernetic upgrades, skills, and even spells that not even Human Revolution was able to pull off, and I'm not even exaggerating about this. It may seem confusing at first and it's a lot to take in a first but it all meshes together so well it even impressed Jim Sterling himself.It's dumb, but it's a lot of unbridled fun. It's crazy dumb fun all over the place and it's cheaper now than it was at launch you won't regret it.			",344,57,10,34,39,1,49

												The graphics are immersive somehow even with the 4x4 texture limit generously given by the Source engine.  The storyline is decent, though it's very hard to understand.  The ranged weapons feel good, melee feels meaty, and hacking is partly dynamic on how good you are rather than your stats, which is something I appreciate.If you have high expectations, don't bother.  This game has many flaws (none of which are gamebreaking), but the concepts are well thought out, if a bit lacking on execution.The menu is strange at best and there's so many things that I don't even understand, but the research system is neat.  You can also augment yourself very much in a Deus Ex style to boost your abilities.If you've played Deus Ex or games like it: Yes.If you can enjoy a game with minor flaws: Yes.If you use a controller: No.If you have high expectations: No.If you're just reading reviews: Play the demo, it'll give you a much better idea of what you're buying.

												THIS IS THE CRAZIEST SOURCEMOD EVER CREATED IN THE HISTORY OF MAN.Install the improved translation mod before you do anything -at all- with this game. Play as a rambo character and become overpowered first before specializing in hacking or psi powers.If games were like alcohol, EYE is like a terrible-tasting and mysterious throat-burning whiskey that also makes you hallucinate and you have no idea what is even happening, but it is awful and amazing at the same time. The balance of the game is absolutely horrendous. Stealth, hacking and psionic builds will be hard-pressed to gain any experience, money or leverage at all; If you are not a ghost-in-the-shell holocaust murder agent you are the equivalent of someone with an english major.The only way to make money or gain experience efficiently is to kill hundreds and hundreds of enemies or speedrun side missions, which could take up to an hour. The maps are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly huge and are designed to be labyrinths. The maps are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥LY XBOX HUGE. It takes maybe 5 minutes to run from point A to point B, where dozens of high-level enemies constantly spawn close to you and make it impossible to catch a break or to heal yourself. Always upgrade your cyber legs.The AI is actually kind of smart and very vicious; they will throw grenades, rush you, corner you and flank you for any chance they get; when there is a 6-story tall cyberdemon only inches between you and a foot soldier, you are still enemy number one. If you dislike constant long-range combat, modify it such that enemies will only notice you at shorter distances and you'll have an easier time with both stealth and gunplay.Besides all of that, this game has an overwhelmingly chaotic atmosphere, very well-done dystopian aesthetics, and swarms upon swarms of enemies that present a constant threat and danger throughout the game. The developers crammed so many elements into the game that an invisible rambo super-fast armored gunslinging cyborg ninja who hacks into people's brains, uses psionic powers and jumps 6 feet into the air is UNDERPOWERED.Cons: Bad translation, incomprehensible to the layman, horrible balance, STUPIDLY GIGANTIC XBOX HUGE MAPS (I cannot stress this enough), no tutorials, a few bullet sponge enemies and a punishing autosave system.Pros: It will all be worth it if you want your head to explode from all of the chaos. I still have PTSD from the Mars mission. This game leaves me wordless to say what really went on in my mind when every element culminated into blasting down helicopters and cyberdemons the size of grand canyons left and right.

												TL;DR:A mashup of Warhammer 40k, Shadowrun, and Deus Ex. The ingredients are right for a perfectly cooked masterpiece, but you have to eat it with chop sticks. Hard at first, but fun once you get the hang of it. Also now a days when it goes on sale it's now only $1, so you can't go wrong.Pre-face:Right now before I get into the meat of this, this game currently has a horrible tutorial for its mechanics and was impossible for me to get into the first time I picked it up, but...Interesting Tidbits:From last I heard the development house has gone through some rough patches. With people up and disapearing from work, and certain complications. Right now the game can be seen as incomplete, but it is a hidden gem of a game.Pros:(+++) Point for point customization (Inventory Tetris, Augmentations, Psionic Powers, Hacking, Cybermancy)(+++) Nitty gritty cyberpunk done right(++) Multiple paths to victory in a given objective(+) You can have special eyes(+) On sale it goes for almost nothing(+?) Tons of complexity (Note, the complexity is the currency with which you buy depth)Cons:(---) No true ending(---) Terrible explination of how the game works (I'm looking at you research)(---) game crippling mistakes that can ruin playthroughs (Dying with low Karma can incure persistent debuffs to stats without expensive research)(--) No more then 3 weapons of a given class(--) Enemy AI is lack luster at times(-) The game is sadly as is. The chance of a update is almost non-existent.Tips:WIKI WIKI WIKI, people have made your life easy. Don't be afraid to make mistakes at first, we all restarted at some point to remake our characters.The heavy sniper can shoot through walls, have fun.Conclusion:A experience akin to the original Deus Ex, little to no handholding. Character customization closer to pen and paper table top games. Play any character you can think of in this world. Sadly despite all these things, I can ignore the obvious faults. Not as bad as the hundreds of pages I had to read in Dungeons and Dragons, but a hefty time investment. If you are iffy on this title wait for a sale to take it down to a couple of dollars, and give it a spin.			",139,24,1,31,10,1,40

												If you've played Deus Ex, then you'll see some similarities in the two games.  This is based off of Deus Ex to a degree, but takes its own spin.  Its definitely not as highly stealth based, since the enemies will aggro to you pretty quickly... But its still a pretty good game.  Worth checking out if its 75% off.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's an atmospheric FPS RPG in which you go through missions being a badass augmented ninja, completing objectives, and taking out enemies with an array of weapons, such as pistols, machine guns, shotguns, sniper rifles, or my favorite; melee weapons. How about a sword that explodes enemies on contact eh?You can buy stuff from the store with money gained from killing enemies, etc, and research misc items that enemies can drop, which can unlock abilities or improve existing attributes of your character.Hacking is also an element in the game, you can do things like hack a door open, turn a turret to your side, or even hack an ATM! But if you lose a hacking minigame, you will get hacked yourself. When that happens you get quite an annoying overlay on your screen saying HACKED!, and cannot hack anything else unless it either goes away on its own, or you hack yourself to get rid of it. You can even lose a hacking battle against yourself! HACKCEPTION!It can get frustrating at times, but for the most part its pretty fun, also its a great value for 10 dollars.

												EYE: Divine Cybermancy is what happens when Deus Ex takes up Warhammer 40,000 as a hobby. A brilliantly atmospheric and characterful game, EYE's world is not fine and dandy. From offering to relieve potential business partners of their heads to encouraging a man to commit suicide, you play with the lock on the door between mean and downright vindictive. Of course, the rest of the world is waiting for you to open the door; spirit werewolves, federal soldiers, bandits and giant cyberdemons are amongst the various enemies you can face in this game.You can use a number of means to go about this game; from straight up rifle combat, heavy weapons use and melee to stealthed sniping, hacking and psychic prowess, there is no singled out method by which one can complete missions. A particular air of revelation is about EYE, making it one of the most enjoyable FPS games I've ever played.The worst thing that could be said about this game is that the translation from French isn't always coherent. Some of the menus are less than intuitive and there isn't a lot of help moving between interfaces. However, personally I reckon the slightly broken English adds something unfamiliar enough to the game to make it feel more alien a world.			",170,22,1,10,9,1,43

												As it is now shortly after release I'm having a hard time recommending this game. Maybe when its been out for a while and had a few patches. The game has very big potential, but the development team has tried to implement way too many things inspired of other games. And with a limited budget as a indie team, it might have been a bit too ambitious.			",276,49,2,15,13,1,33

												I appreciate this games  'ultra-hard' attitude and attention to detail. What I don't appreciate is  the auto-save system. Auto-save is all well and good but save points are far and few between, according to some players hours apart. I nearly completed the first mission when I had to leave for a social event. I came back and found that I was smack dab at the beginning. I don't feel like I should be punished for having a life outside this game. I will recommend E.Y.E. when they fix the save system.

												This game is interesting from a design standpoint, if not nescessarily terribly good. It has an incredibly complex character system and allows you a huge number of different approaches to completing its missions, then sabotages itself by making simply mowing everything down with a chaingun by far the easiest method of getting by. This game is often confusing and tries to tell a story that is hard to follow.Worth a look if you're into games that have unique mechanics and settings, but not worth buying if you're looking for something that comes without major frustrations and shortcomings.

												Pretty hardcore cyberpunk FPS-RPG. It's like a twisted and weird occult version of Deus Ex and System Shock 2, with emphasis on the shooter side. Bad translation and the incomprehensible plot add to the confusion and the game doesn't spoonfeed you (which is a good thing). Don't expect too much polish and some of the areas are frustrating, but otherwise a fine solid game. Ignore singleplayer, the game shines in coop when players can specialize their classes more. Also, NECROCYBERMANCERS.			",554,177,10,94,66,6,114

												Recommended but only just.The Good:The story is certainly interestingThe settings are also interestingCyber Ninja powers (!)Certain sections look very nice indeedThe Meh:The controls are funky and rebinding them is almost mandatoryThe graphics in the majority of places are atrocious for a 2011 release and could easily be from 2003The gun and sword play is decidely averageThe Bad:The ******* translation. To say it is bad would be an understantment. For a story as conveluted as E.Y.E.'s you have to be able to read the text with minimal difficulty. I believe the studio is French but that is no excuse. England is only 30 minutes away!The world is empty. Oh, sure, there are monsters and bad guys aplenty but there is no one else around at all. It feels extremely lifeless and isolating.The AI is below average. If you are not behind something. or cloaked, the enemy will magically turn on the spot and come straight for you with guns blazing.Infinitely spawning enemies. 'Nuff said.Conclusion:With the current trend of remaking everything, from classic games to film franchises, E.Y.E. Divine Cybermancy would be a prime target for such treatment. Updated graphics, AI, translation etc could easily put this game in contention for GotY.I may have listed quiet a few negatives there, and they can be extremely aggrevating,  but, for those willing to push on through, you can find the sparks of a great game and I do recommend giving it a fair shot.

												Straight to it: the save function is quirkly designed and unexpected. The gameplay itself is rather clunky, too. I've no interest in playing a RPG that doesn't allow me to save my progress whenever I want, or that has checkpoint saves so far apart that it literally would take hours to reach each one if you chose to opt for sidequests. For that matter, I've little time to play anything built on the Source engine. It's decrepit; the graphics feel like late '90's, and player interactions with the environment feel decidedly antiquated.  Finally, why is the game so dark? It's really freaking dark! In the same vein as Doom 3.TL;DR: Bad save system by design and old engine leaves this one for the hardcore nerds who have LOTS of time to blow off.			",101,22,2,14,3,1,17

												edit: if you think I've totally missed the point, then please comment and tell me what I've missed! I really want to like this game, but I think it misses the mark.Original:I haven't got the remotest ****ing clue what is going on in this game. And not in a clever, mysterious, well-crafted-world-where-not-all-is-as-it-seems way, which it's clear the devs were trying for. Even overlooking the english-as-a-second-language mistakes, the writing is utter garbage. Too many factions and characters introduced too quickly and making no apparent difference to what's going on.I have amnesia and don't know anything about my situation, yet I have opinions and memories about various characters?More importantly, I don't understand the gameplay mechanics and there's very little explanation. You need to remember the briefing dialogue, because despite there being a high tech character UI it doesn't record dialogue and the objectives it does record don't give you any idea why you're doing them if you don't remember the details.This game is a mess. It wants very badly to be a blend of Syndicate, Deus Ex, and possibly Fallout's Brotherhood of Steel. It doesn't succeed. There's probably a good game somewhere in there, but there's so much mess that should have been stripped out or implemented better.Not explaining anything in game is not a substitute for cleverness. It's just an inscrutable, badly put together mess.			",121,27,0,10,21,2,25

												As others have said, it's near impossible to know what is going on due to bad translations and seemingly a lack of good organization, therefore it is difficult to maintain interest in the plot...whatever that is. The dialogue reads like a child whose second language is English wrote it; overly simple and full of mistakes. This GREATLY affects immersion. Immersion is kind of important in a story-driven/RPG game.Speaking of the dialogue, it's text-based and a ton of reading. If I wanted to read a badly written story, I'd pick up a book by whoever wrote 'Twilight'. Despite that, the premise is good from what I read on the store page; it may not have been half as bad if the translation were better and the dialogue less childlike.The graphics are good but devoid of anything interesting or much that's interactive, there is a lot of empty space to trudge through.UI and UX are an absolute mess. If you want to play with a controller, forget about it. You won't be able to access most anything via controller besides cycling through weapons, using the weapons, and pausing the game. Though you can control movement with a controller... Everything else (picking things up, hacking, dialogue, accessing UI, etc.) must be done with the keyboard, so it's simpler to stick with the keyboard/mouse combo throughout. I feel there is way too much going on with the various menus, it was not intuitive whatsoever and took too long for me to grow accustomed to.0/10 -- I found no redeeming qualities, even the low price I paid. In an RPG I want to INTERACT, be a PART of and guide the story. None of those things were possible for me here. I don't hate this game, I simply find nothing to recommend it.1/11: edited to include more info re: gamepad vs. keyboard/mouse			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A surfeit of good ideas undone by♥♥♥♥♥♥poor execution.  I can't think of another game which is, by turns, as awesome and awful as E.Y.E.  It creates a great first impression, however, with one of the biggest and (seemingly) complex stat and upgrade systems of any action RPG out there, with lots of different unique powers to buy (invisibility cloaks, the ability to clone yourself and control enemies with your mind, etc, etc) and scores of different weapons (most of which handle pretty well).Unfortunately, all of these good ideas can't do much to counter the game's terrible A.I., boring combat, constantly respawning enemies, erratic level design (some are well done, while others are just big empty boxes), and incomprehensible writing/storyline.  So at the end of the day the game's RPG pretensions are for naught: no matter how many upgrades you buy or how many times you level up the game still plays like an amateurish, unfinished, sub-mediocre Half-Life 2 mod.

Warning: This Game is not Controller Friendly.This may not be an issue for a lot of people, but it was an absolute deal breaker for me.  Normally, when a game is listed as having Partial Controller Support, it is mostly playable with your controller and only occasionally requires you to use your mouse or keyboard.  This is simply not the case with this game.  There are far too many required functions to be able to map them all to a standard controller, so you will need to use your keyboard so much that even attempting to use the controller just seems pointless.Again, I realize that this isn't  an issue for a lot of PC gamers, but I feel like those who, like me, prefer to play their games wilth a controller will be disappointed with just how hard it is to play this game with one.  It's too bad; this one looks like it could have been a fun cyberpunk adventure.			",240,159,2,57,25,2,32

												This game has a lot of interesting ideas, but they are poorly integrated into a clunky, unintuitive and ultimately disappointing mess. Like hacking? Even with loads of point in hacking everything but doors take way too long. The respawning enemies patrolling around the level will spot and unload into you before you can hope to finish. Regular things are a chore to hack. Even with 50 points in hacking I had trouble opening a ventilation shaft in a later level, necessitating several runs of spamming the shield and attack options for minutes on end.Like blowing things up with your mind? EYE fares much better here, but the stat requirements for the most powerful psi-spells meant that after wasting many points on hacking I had to resort to heavy grinding to be able to use them before the end of the campaign. By the way, dont even bother with the methods listed in the grinding guides on the community hub, a custom map ""cm_farm_alpha23"" will get you your brouzoufs/xp much, much faster, without the infuriating and frequent stat penalties incurred from falling down a hole on the Minos map.Cybernetic implants will be familiar to any Deus Ex player and do what they need to, however if you wish to use several of them as well as psi powers your quick actions menu will be overloaded, and the psi-power selector is far too cumbersome when you are switching between over five powers in the heat of combat. The clunkiness of the controls is made worse by the actions menu leaving the flow of game time at its normal pace, and that weapons are assigned hotkeys based on the order you last added them to your inventory, leaving you stumbling to find your medkit when you have a sliver of health left. Deus Ex easily had a far better system of weapon/skill hotkeys, 11 years before EYE was released.Everything is poorly explained. Game is listed as having co-op, but it only works if you and a friend are willing to jump through many hoops. Dialog sucks, bad english and criminal surfer gangs abound. Many dialog trees have half the options end the conversation and initiate combat, while redundant the hostile option switch in the order of responses, seemingly to punish people skipping through text. Weapons all seem pretty fun but prepare to grind if you want to use the biggest and baddest ones within your first campaign. Enemy and ally AI is abysmal, humans will stop the exact spot they see you and fire their semiautomatic weapons without end. Mutant enemies will run into your bullets single file. Levels are apparently designed to have you drain all your energy sprinting around. If you come to this game with low expectations and dont bother with hacking, it might be worth buying at 90% off. Otherwise stay clear of it.4/10			",188,18,4,26,15,0,42

												So much is wrong with this game that I can't recommend it. Not for ten dollars, and not to anyone but the biggest cyberpunk fans. There are just so many common sense things missing and so many awful design choices that I cannot recommend it, not even for a dollar. It's a shame because the game is ALMOST good. The only thing keeping it from being good is the sheer number of things wrong with it.Things it does right:- A somewhat interesting story that I won't spoil here.- The story has choices that slightly alter little things later on in the game, and they are EVERYWHERE, even if the spelling and grammar leaves a bit to be desired.- There are multiple endings. The game is designed to be replayed over again multiple times to get all of the endings.- Graphics and art direction are top shelf stuff, for a Source game.- Soundtrack is great, I really enjoyed it.- The weapons look and feel good, and the gear is generally pretty useful (turrets, for example, which you can place up to 8 in a game).- MOST (not all) of the cybernetic upgrades really do make you feel more powerful as you upgrade them.- Lots of cyberpunk references, which is great if you like cyberpunk.And now to list all of the problems this game has (that I can think of):- Absolutely horrid multiplayer component that requires you to forward your ports and then jump through a specific set of hoops in order for your friends to be able to join your game every time you start a server. Your friends also have to have their ports forwarded to be able to join. This is unacceptable for a game in 2011, let alone any time after that. The devs have decided, however, that this is perfectly fine and have made no attempts to update the game in order to make online play work smoothly.-♥♥♥♥♥♥poor admin controls. By default, you're only able to use the addid command to temporarily ban a player from your game. The ban only lasts for the duration that the server stays up, and doesn't seem to add the player to the banned players list. The banned player will not be told they are banned, and upon trying to reconnect will just get instantly disconnected. There's no excuse for this, especially considering that the Source engine, by default, allows you to have a list of banned players by SteamID, and actively adds banned players to the list as you ban them. Why was this removed or altered in any way? Even if there is a way to ban players using third party tools, this is unacceptable.- While we're on the subject of console commands, this game lacks them. You can't cheat, most of the commands you enter will give you a ""HURR STOP CHEATING"" warning. This means you can't even noclip if you get stuck somewhere, let alone any of the other fun or useful stuff that you can do with console commands.- The levels all seem to have been poorly playtested, as there are areas where enemies can go right through solid walls and shoot out at you.- Awful enemy spawning system, which ties into the statement above about the game being poorly playtested. There will be spawn areas where enemies will start to spawn practically right in front of you if you turn the camera away just enough. This happens in almost every level in the game, and there are some levels that are especially bad for it.- Number of enemies and how often they spawn is very inconsistent from level to level. The devs added options to change spawn frequency at some point, which helped, but not much. Some levels will have an overwhelming number of enemies pouring in at you, while others, with the exact same spawn settings, will pretty much be a drought. Again, this seems to be a problem stemming from lack of playtesting.- Dropships with rockets are contrastingly powerful when compared to almost all of the other enemies in the game. They can catch you off guard (read: SPAWN RIGHT ABOVE OR BEHIND YOU) and blast you to bits in less than three seconds flat. This is especially troubling in some levels that have poor visibility. They can see you but you can't see them. Better yet, there are certain areas where they can somehow go right through a wall and then shoot at you back through said wall.- Tons of grammar and spelling errors.- A weird little glitch in the inventory system where your ammo count will not match up with what's actually in your inventory.- An asinine and pointless karma system, which is attached to a system that gives you semi-permanent stat penalties if you die while you have low karma.- A leveling system that can be abused by way of gaining semi-permanent stat penalties from killing yourself or dying. Once a stat starts requiring more than one point in order to increase its level, just get a semi-permanent stat penalty so that you only have to pay one point. Once you're satisfied, research the items necessary to remove these semi-permanent stat penalties, and there you go, you spent significantly less points than you otherwise would have on your stats.- The game is hard for new players to understand, and can be very alienating for new players- Whatever is left of the multiplayer community is comprised of tryhard fantards of the game. They'll try to order new players around, aren't very helpful, and generally act like elitist♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ This is awful to have to deal with when one of them joins your game while you're playing with friends and decides to start acting disruptive. When you ban someone, you also have to kick them in order for it to work, and they won't be permanently banned. Kicking someone restarts the level. This is a huge problem, and also probably the main reason you don't see many servers up. People who want to play co-op will play it privately with their friends in order to avoid dealing with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who wanna ruin their easily ruinable fun.Overall a 4/10, maybe 5/10 on a good day. Get it on sale for a dollar if you like cyberpunk and don't mind putting up with a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in your games, otherwise avoid at any price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is as indecipherable as it is boring. The control scheme is impossible, the quests have no conceivable purpose and the every aspect of the game lacks basic instruction. There's no tutorial to speak of for the more complicated functions of your character. Fact is, it's not that the concept is bad (although gun-toting samurai in space seems pretty random) it's that it's executed so poorly that the game is simply impossible to play. Don't buy this. It's not even worth the $2 it costs at 80% off. It's terrible. TERRIBLE.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Terrible game with terrible keybinds, just a mess! All I wanted was to get some cards to the steam winter thingy, and I went to play it... Geez, the problem starts in the creating of your character! You don`t know who you are, You don`t know what you are and you have to choose betwen some weird combination of things that you don`t know what are you doing! You finish randomly choosing whatever and going in... Then part of the tutorial is like any other games: Letters pop out and you know what to do, then some ""press enter to pick up the pistol"" appeared and... guess what... The action button is the enter. Yep. Then, the tutorial tells me to press T to watch tutorial videos????? Really??? Nope, pressed up any button and I could pass through that part. I had a pistol and a katana. found some enemies, went to kill them with my pistol and i had no precision at all, even in the sights, pulled out my katana and the enemies start to throw grenades at me? Wow, that scalated quickly. Passed through that too. Finally, Some strange door is in my way, with ""hack"" on it. 5 minutes to figure how to hack that damn door and guess what, the door hacked me and killed me. At that point, I alt tabbed the game, got the cards and damn, uninstalled that ♥♥♥♥♥, because that's what you do with this game.			",152,19,9,11,12,0,17

												Terrible game. A stealthgame which stealthmechanics doesnt work, enemies jump at you all at once, too much unique mechanics that are introduced to you all at once, making ""you"" uninterested about what they do. An FPS with an extremly limited inventory space which means only one item can be hold at once, if you run out of ammo you can pick up the one who is laying on the ground but then you have to go into your inventory (wich doesnt pause the game) and have to drag it away at the same time you´ll get nuked by all enemies on the map.

												Ever imagined what a game would look like if you combined Half-Life 2, Deus Ex and Warhammer and put it in a steampunkish world? Sounds great? Yeah, it would. But now remove everything that's awesome and you get this pile of nonsense.I really tried to like this game. It has some great ideas, but it all gets butchered away by those massive flaws.Pros:- The weapon design is pretty good.- The handling of the weapons when hitting enemies was decent.- Fighting was very tight and actually really fun!- Overall graphics, there was nothing to complain about.- The design of the characters was very refreshing. Seeing how the Inquisition could look in 200 hundred years? OH YES!Cons:- The first level / dream sequence. To introduce a gamer properly to a game, what would be the best way? Ah yes, of course, the worst level the gaming industry has to offer. What could go possible go wrong?- The ingame currency is called Brouzouf. Well, did they just took a dictionary and looked for the worst-sounding word they could find? Surely they did, and succeeded.- The ingame menu. Ho. Ly. Hell. Is it even possible to make it even more complicated and frustrating to use? I don't think so.- The story. What the hell is even happening? It was very hard to focus and follow anything.- There is some kind of helping section / FAQ within the game, but it's so useless you're more confused after reading it than before. It just states ""Look for the Hacking entry in the help section."" Why can't the game itself put up a dialog or window to show me how to do it?- Having PSI powers and such is a great idea, but I don't had the feeling they helped much.- The levels are great in general design, but ridiculously gigantic. You're feeling like an escaping lab rat. Ever played Serious Sam? Well against this game, Serious Sam has tiny levels. Other problem is, they are extremely dull and there is almost nothing to exlore; only dead ends that lead absolutey nowhere, only one door that you can open and so on. Here and there are NPC with a mission for you, but these sections are so offside it almost feels like a different level.- Enemies are sharpshooters. No matter what weapon they have, they will hit you at ANY distance with the accuracy of a sniper. Most of the time you're being hit and you have absolutely no idea from where.- Once your enemies see you, they'll hunt you and they know exactly where you are.- Respawning enemies. Because ♥♥♥♥ you, player!- The inventory is horrendous to use. I constantly picked up ammo and was also constantly running out of ammo of the same type. What the hell. Reordering is a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and you have to drag and drop the ammo clip in the exact corner of the cell of your inventory or it doesn't work. Guess the developers had never ever ever ever played this game by themselves.- The hacking system? I don't have a clue, this has to be the biggest, most imbecil implementation of any hacking system ever invented. And the so called tutorial is an even bigger joke.- Voice acting is terrible. It sounds like the same voice actor was first punshed in the throat, then chained in a huge tin and forced to read all those lines.So, I really can't recommend this game. It has some great ideas in a postapocalyptic steampunkish world, but the interface, the enemies, the huge levels... everything is a huge disappointment and letdown.			",224,20,13,20,11,1,19

The cyberpunk theme is there but they tried to put too much into it and its just far too unpolished... and I don't think they could ever polish it enough to be nice. ",236,23,10,28,12,0,34

Interspersed are puzzles like, jump-over-the-wall, or hack-the-door.It looks like a game that had grand aspirations that just went flat over time.			",68,10,1,22,1,0,6

												I want this game to be so much better than it is... It is frustrating when you die and end up 4 missions back from when you died, especially when the thing that killed you gave no warning (not even a sound, just a red screen and then a loading bar) before doing so.     This is supposed to be a traditionally hardcore shooter, but the things that supposedly make it hardcore instead just make it stupid. To make it ""hardcore"", I'd recommend removing the resurrector completely, reducing the amount of ammo you are allowed to utilize during an individual mission, and then fixing all of the idiocy of the A.I. and polishing the actual mechanics of the game.     It's a solid game, but the issues add up fast. Bugs aren't the issue; I haven't run into a bug yet. The issues lie with the game itself. There is only ever really one approach to beating each mission: kill everything that isn't marked as an ally. The other methods of completing objectives are much harder than mowing down enemies with big guns and grenades, and provide fewer benefits. Hacking a bank dispenser gives you less experience and money than just standing next to the bank dispenser and killing the spawning waves of enemies.     Rating of implementation for various things:Menus? You have to figure them out a bit, but once you do it's simple to see they did a great job here.7/10.Cybernetics? I love that these all actually make sense and that careful observation will show a noticeable difference upon upgrading them. They're much too expensive, however.7/10.Research? The element of mystery is something they should keep, to some degree, but the cost outweighs the benefits most of the time.7/10.Lore? Take Warhammer 10k (not 40k) and then spice it up with some major Deus Ex, then twist the whole thing until it's only recognizable by the threads that link things together. Decent, but a little too vague and washed-out. Also, there's almost zero backstory for any part of the game.6/10.Gameplay? The epic feeling of rolling around in heavy armor with a minigun and trashing hordes of monsters and men alike is interrupted annoyingly every time anyone ever carries an armor-piercing weapon. You cannot survive single-player without heavy armor, either. Every resource uses the same pool of energy, which is a huge detractor from the game for anyone wanting to use psychic powers or even for the folks that want to sprint everywhere to make things go faster. That's it's own point; the game is slow as molasses even though action is constant, which is amazing (in a bad way) in its own right. The game has some pacing issues, and there needs to be a clearer sense of development for the characters you interact with, and that's before mentioning your own personal character lacking any sort of depth beyond ""don't trust mentor"" and talking to yourself. I'm surprised enemies don't go insane from fighting a juggernaut with a minigun that blew up half their allies into chunks of gore, too, since a single carnophage that does no damage to me (blocked with my sword) made me go insane and start shooting randomly once I pulled out my gun; maintenance as a super easy fix to this actually makes it amusing rather than scary, however... And insanity isn't exactly something I'd prefer to pull my humor from.3/10.Bugs? I haven't found any, but I'm placing ""color scheme"" here; this is more of a personal issue, but I can't tell apart most things in this game due to the coloration. I can see text and screens in-game, but I cannot see the monsters or people without using cyber vision or the second zoom of the sniper rifle. It's supposed to be cyberpunk and/or steampunk but it really just comes across as dirty and otherwise empty. Upping the brightness doesn't help.7/10.     Overall Rating: I'll put it somewhere around 6/10. It's a decent game, but the group of people that will enjoy it is likely much smaller than the group that will be dissapointed by the difference between the reality of the game and the potential of what it could have been.     It should be noted that the game is pretty cheap, so if you're buying it during a 75% or 50% sale, I would instead recommend it. I mean, it's worth at least $5.			",15,3,0,6,1,0,6

												I don't really know if i reccomend this game or not, Its a very....Different type of game. There are no health kits, the enmies can kill you in one or two swipes and most of the time your character is too tall for lots of doors and you end up banging your head and having to crouch walk under door ways. The ladder climbing is So slow, its like the ladder climbing from metal gear solid snake eater but without catchy music, and Not to mention the Tutorials are not very clear on how to do things.The Story is great, It looks absolutely beautiful, but overrall im kinda...Meh about it. It was not exactly a good game, but not a bad game. Just wish that the enemies could scale to you, And that your heavy armor actually made you feel you have heavy armor, not like your wearing a tunic made out of crafting paper.So since there are more negatives then positives i guess its a No reccomendation.

												Bad things first: Awful, just awful level design. I would expect something like this when i was playing 15 year old games. Levels are huge and empty and just feel confusing as someone with multiple personality disorder would design.Level design is not the only thing that is 15 years old - user interface is also something out of 90's. To open an inventory, you have to hold down C, drag mouse down, let go of C, select inventory from full screen of text and other stuff. There wasnt a way to bind a key to the inventory. Why would you design it like this?Respawning enemies. What were they thinking? I am just curious how the playtesting was, because this makes you constantly out of ammo and makes the stealth almost useless. Aside from the fact that AI's basically have unlimited sight nor does the level design support the stealth.Things that are good:Text is good. It is well written. I enjoyed reading the background lore, but when you are not reading, the levels jump from one location to another and you have no idea what's going on. Conclusion: 15 years behind in level design, UI design and gameplay design. That's a sunken boat that even interesting text could not save. I do not recommend this game. Only buy this if it is on sale and try the demo before you buy.PS: I am probably a minority expressing this opinion of this game. If you like this game then we don't have the same taste in games.

												I most heartily do not recommend this game. Monumentally awful. Literally so bad as to be painful to play. Don't  be fooled by the gameplay videos making it look like a fun, fairly original game - it is so hampered by an utterly incomprehensible and ludicrously convoluted control system as to be quite unbearable. And that's without even taking into account the awful (and french. Yes, really) voice acting and the poorly designed missions. Genuinely, probably the worst game I've played in a decade. Grim.

												Attempting to explain this game is like trying to describe the plot of Neon Genesis: Evangelion. You think it's doable, but as soon as try you have no clue where to start and just end up with a confusing mess of description.You're a guy, you're a part of an elite order, you're fighting against another elite order. Doors can hack you, and girls still don't talk to you. So your character goes ''absolutely mental lad'' and does some weird♥♥♥♥♥♥ I honestly don't know if this game has a happy ending or not because my character was so far gone all i could do was grunt, go on killing sprees, and leave mean comments on Reddit.It's fun though, and quite the experience.

												Very unique experience. Amazing world-building and lore with tons of attention to detail. Gameplay is great and the fps and rpg elements don't intrude/distract from one another. Hacking is well-designed and feels like an extension of the game instead of a silly minigame. Level and character design allows for multiple playstyles with a good variety of weaponry and psi powers (basically magic). Artstyle is nice and pays homage to its inspiriations rather than ripping them off.The only downside I've really found is the low population. The multiplayer is extremely fun but there are very few people on (the most populated server I found had 5 people playing, and the few others had 1-2).  ",125,11,2,21,12,1,25

												There's very little hook to get you interested in the story, and what little story this title presents is crumbling under the weight of an incompetent or simply nonexistent editor. Don't expect to be emotionally invested in this game, because both the story and the mechanics are both so poorly presented as to be incomprehensible. There might be a really great experience hidden somewhere beneath the broken tutorial system, the completely uninteresting characters, and the mediocre environment design, but this strictly amateur work is turning me off from digging any deeper to try and find it. Forget about ""polishing"" this, what this title needs is to have the finish stripped, the paint sanded off, and to have the entire user experience reworked from the bare metal.You can tell that a lot of work has been put into the foundational elements of the gameplay - the damage/HP/healing system, the level-up system, the different abilities and weapons, and even the hacking mechanic - but it's all presented in a bland way that makes me think the team got bored with making this game halfway through and decided to phone it in as soon as the levels were designed and the largest bugs in the gameplay were ironed out. It feels like an ""Early Access"" title that never made it to version 1.0.			",49,9,1,4,8,0,4

												I really like E.Y.E., but it isn't exactly a good game.On the one hand, the english translation is pretty terrible, so its almost impossible to understand what you're trying to do at any given time. The tutorial is pretty much a list of videos with unhelpful descriptions and it only gets more confusing from there. Maybe it makes more sense in french, but I doubt it.On the other hand, are there any other games out there where you can kill friend or enemy with a medkit? Are there any where you can try to hack a door and have it hack you back? Use a revolver to take out a helicopter? When was the last time you saw a game featuring rastafarians on mars?If you can get it for around a dollar, I'd say E.Y.E. is worth the time just to see what kind of crazy stuff you'll run into. Co-op is pretty fun too, so if you can convince your friends to split a 4 pack you're in for a pretty good time.			",166,33,5,13,10,1,21

												Certainly not an easy game to get started with on Normal difficulty with the endless waves of enemies that will once in awhile shoot one another or at another faction, but 90% of time gang up on you if spotted. Tutorial vids are a bit of a joke, the voice acting is all in a made-up language (subtitles for all!), controls are complicated without rebinding, and the over-all feel is that of a mod and not an original, stand-alone title. Biggest gripe I have is the ""weapon group"" keybinds; every single time you start a game or load a level, they RANDOMIZE what groups they select. So one level your AR, SMG, and swords are 1, 2, 3; next level its your swords, grenades, and medkit on 1, 2, 3; level after that its your AR, grenades, medkit. It's frustrating to rely on the mouse wheel to cycle through ALL your weapons/gear when in a firefight. This is apparent with manual reloading, as its quicker (or SHOULD BE) to change weapons than to reload, especially with something like the minigun or the .50 sniper rifle. But no, unless you're a 2 guns, no gear, player, the wheel will annoy ya. Overall, ONCE YOU GET THE THING GOING, it CAN be fun. Feels like an arena shooter with a poorly written plot. With friends, maybe more so, but solo it does get old quick, and the main campaign isn't easy to follow. Can't honestly say I recomend this game to the pick-up-and-go style players. Fallout 3 was once described as Oblivion with Guns. E.Y.E. Divine Cybermancy is like Morrowind with Guns, but only with it's complexity. So final verdict: nay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There's very little hook to get you interested in the story, and what little story this title presents is crumbling under the weight of an incompetent or simply nonexistent editor. Don't expect to be emotionally invested in this game, because both the story and the mechanics are both so poorly presented as to be incomprehensible. There might be a really great experience hidden somewhere beneath the broken tutorial system, the completely uninteresting characters, and the mediocre environment design, but this strictly amateur work is turning me off from digging any deeper to try and find it. Forget about ""polishing"" this, what this title needs is to have the finish stripped, the paint sanded off, and to have the entire user experience reworked from the bare metal.You can tell that a lot of work has been put into the foundational elements of the gameplay - the damage/HP/healing system, the level-up system, the different abilities and weapons, and even the hacking mechanic - but it's all presented in a bland way that makes me think the team got bored with making this game halfway through and decided to phone it in as soon as the levels were designed and the largest bugs in the gameplay were ironed out. It feels like an ""Early Access"" title that never made it to version 1.0.			",49,9,1,4,8,0,4

												I bought this game with high hopes seeing as it's received good reviews overall and is made with the Source Engine. After playing it through to the ""true"" ending, I feel like I can now properly write a review. This game was a HUGE disappointment. The UI is god-awful, the story is confusing and poorly-presented, and the terrible translation job is super distracting. I'm not terribly picky with FPSs. As long as they either have enjoyable gameplay or an engrossing, well-done story, I'm satisfied. E.Y.E fell short in both aspects. I kept hoping the story would begin to come together, but even after reading other players' explanations, I find it poorly done. It's like the developers have an actual interesting idea in mind for what's going on, but they never properly deliver it. Heck, maybe they don't even know wtf is going on in the game. I don't recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There is a particular kind of game that one describes as a 'cult classic': It has many, many good features, but these are undermined by the simple fact that, to the unobsessed mind, the game is just bad. For all its brilliant moments, it is still dull.Well, let me tell you, E.Y.E Divine Cybermancy fills that niche like nothing else.Yes, there are good parts, I won't deny that. The combat is fun and diverse, and the hacking and resurrecting systems are so damn clever I found myself wondering why other developers hadn't ripped their ideas off already. It's great stuff, really. Trouble is that's where all the good parts run out.See, the game is French, and the poor translation makes it so that a fellow like me has no hope in hell of understanding the already obscure and tangled plot thanks to terrible, awful translation. Even if it was translated decently I still suspect I wouldn't like it, because the dialouge from the protagonist and like the two permanent characters in the game is this hypermasculine bullcrap that doesn't sound like it could ever come from human mouths. Beyond that, the overlying plot is this whole cliche cyberpunk tangle of mixed metaphors and randomly running into folks from the enemy faction, talking to them, finding that your only responses are insults, and then walking away from them as if you haven't been turning their brethren into crispy giblets for the last couple of hours.Now that might not be a problem if these NPC's were placed in sensible places, but the map design is utter garbage both visually and mechanically, so you'll find these dudes just hangin' around inside bombed-out cafes. The levels are these small nonlinear maps that are lifeless masses of grey and brown palettes with a bit of bad neon slapped in a few places if you're supposed to be in a city. Everything's big, ugly, blocky, and roped off to the point you just really want to stop.And the enemies don't help this either! You mostly fight two different types of humans with no differences between them beyond more ugly or less ugly, and when the token zombie faction shows up its enemies are even worse, consisting of a pink xenomorph clone, a werewolf, a nondescript DOOM demon, and a big dude with hammers that looks like he crawled out of a fantasy game!So, my verdict? Stay away. Buy it if you're curious, but don't expect returns. Expect to crawl through the same environments over and over again, asking yourself if a solid foundation justifies shoddy scaffolding, and finding the same answer every time: NO.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It feels more like a very ambitious Half Life mod than a full fledged game. Maybe it gets cooler if you put some hours into it, but so far its a very mediocre shooter with clumsily glued-on elements like Hacking and Stealth. I dont mind an amateurish tutorial that informs you from time to time that you should now look up a minimalistic video from another menu.Same thing with the sad AI. Smarter is not automatically better (although the game makes modern FPS bots look like Turing-Test-beating quantum-machines).The terrible pacing- my inner cyborg can still cope. Lots of games have terrible pacing these days.Even E.Y.E.'s  inability to communicate even an excuse of a story is not the final nail in the coffin.What REALLY kills the mood is the terrible art direction. I signed in for some Cyberpunk gawddammit- this is just a mess! Think late 90s FPS: Barely recognizable enemies amidst giant, barrel-filled halls that follow no sensible design or function.The reviewborg shed 1,5/ 5 tears ....in ... rain			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is... Well, I'll just give a brief synopsis.You play as a cyborg ninja-samurai person, who works for an organisation that's pretty much the Illuminati, that's currently preparing for a coup in order to overthrow the intergalactic government. You've recently suffered extreme memory loss due to a mysterious mission you embarked on, and you work for a secret team within your organization aiming to resolve a long-standing rivalry within itself between two major factions (The ""Culters"" and the ""Jians"")  by destroying the Jians completely. Meanwhile, your mentor intends to try and bring peace between the two factions, and you're going to have to decide where your loyalties lie.While trying to progress the story and resolve the whole situation, as well as discovering all of your forgotten and darkest secrets, you will enter environments where you can't get more than five seconds of peace before being continously assaulted by horrific entities born from the deepest essences of humanity's impurities, cops, looters, other cyborg ninjas, giant minotaurs with gatling guns that are bigger than a bus, werewolves, or a combination of the six, all in pursuit of the universal RPG goal of making an absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of money so you can keep upgrading your jump height and laugh at the fact your character can now moon-jump across entire maps.You'll also invest your money in funding research, and your researchers should revolutionise the entire universe's perspective on technology around every week. You'll buy new weapons, abilities, psychic powers and implants in order to continously make yourself more powerful. You'll hack sentry guns, ATMs, doors, people, and even yourself (no seriously you can hack yourself). You'll learn how to telefrag your enemies and create clone armies. You'll deploy armies of robots to do your bidding. You'll enslave lesser beings to obey your will. You'll slay monsters ten times as big as yourself.And most importantly, you can run around with a sword that makes people explode when you hit them, and get paid for doing it.			",120,15,0,13,15,0,8

Are there any where you can try to hack a door and have it hack you back? Use a revolver to take out a helicopter? When was the last time you saw a game featuring rastafarians on mars?If you can get it for around a dollar, I'd say E.Y.E. is worth the time just to see what kind of crazy stuff you'll run into. Co-op is pretty fun too, so if you can convince your friends to split a 4 pack you're in for a pretty good time.			",166,33,5,13,10,1,21

												Certainly not an easy game to get started with on Normal difficulty with the endless waves of enemies that will once in awhile shoot one another or at another faction, but 90% of time gang up on you if spotted. Tutorial vids are a bit of a joke, the voice acting is all in a made-up language (subtitles for all!), controls are complicated without rebinding, and the over-all feel is that of a mod and not an original, stand-alone title. Biggest gripe I have is the ""weapon group"" keybinds; every single time you start a game or load a level, they RANDOMIZE what groups they select. So one level your AR, SMG, and swords are 1, 2, 3; next level its your swords, grenades, and medkit on 1, 2, 3; level after that its your AR, grenades, medkit. It's frustrating to rely on the mouse wheel to cycle through ALL your weapons/gear when in a firefight. This is apparent with manual reloading, as its quicker (or SHOULD BE) to change weapons than to reload, especially with something like the minigun or the .50 sniper rifle. But no, unless you're a 2 guns, no gear, player, the wheel will annoy ya. Overall, ONCE YOU GET THE THING GOING, it CAN be fun. Feels like an arena shooter with a poorly written plot. With friends, maybe more so, but solo it does get old quick, and the main campaign isn't easy to follow. Can't honestly say I recomend this game to the pick-up-and-go style players. Fallout 3 was once described as Oblivion with Guns. E.Y.E. Divine Cybermancy is like Morrowind with Guns, but only with it's complexity. So final verdict: nay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Why are full version reviews much better that demo's? Becouse in the first 20 hours you won't understand anything. At the beginning story and character development was black magic to me. I even quit this game for some time. But after solving few mysteries i found this game brilliant. You can be anyone you want: hacker, ninja, tank, technology freak or even a wizard. Playing this with friends trying to be stealthy and then just killing everyone is extreme fun. To bo honest one of very few coop games that don't end after 5 minutes. Did i mention that my legs are OK? Also, there's a man with saw blade instead of hair.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Between losing my legs and gaining Brouzouf, I've found myself in a strangely weird world filled with very odd enemies and questionable allies. I'm really enjoying myself in this crazy world. If you are off put by the source engine then this might not be the game for you, but If you don't mind that, this is a very deeply complex and indepth shooter RPG that gives games like Morrowind a run for their money.

												This game is... Well, I'll just give a brief synopsis.You play as a cyborg ninja-samurai person, who works for an organisation that's pretty much the Illuminati, that's currently preparing for a coup in order to overthrow the intergalactic government. You've recently suffered extreme memory loss due to a mysterious mission you embarked on, and you work for a secret team within your organization aiming to resolve a long-standing rivalry within itself between two major factions (The ""Culters"" and the ""Jians"")  by destroying the Jians completely. Meanwhile, your mentor intends to try and bring peace between the two factions, and you're going to have to decide where your loyalties lie.While trying to progress the story and resolve the whole situation, as well as discovering all of your forgotten and darkest secrets, you will enter environments where you can't get more than five seconds of peace before being continously assaulted by horrific entities born from the deepest essences of humanity's impurities, cops, looters, other cyborg ninjas, giant minotaurs with gatling guns that are bigger than a bus, werewolves, or a combination of the six, all in pursuit of the universal RPG goal of making an absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of money so you can keep upgrading your jump height and laugh at the fact your character can now moon-jump across entire maps.You'll also invest your money in funding research, and your researchers should revolutionise the entire universe's perspective on technology around every week. You'll buy new weapons, abilities, psychic powers and implants in order to continously make yourself more powerful. You'll hack sentry guns, ATMs, doors, people, and even yourself (no seriously you can hack yourself). You'll learn how to telefrag your enemies and create clone armies. You'll deploy armies of robots to do your bidding. You'll enslave lesser beings to obey your will. You'll slay monsters ten times as big as yourself.And most importantly, you can run around with a sword that makes people explode when you hit them, and get paid for doing it.			",120,15,0,13,15,0,8

												This is some WEIRD game. It has A LOT of things that -at least- could have been done better (some may argue that they're strictly BAD, and maybe they're right). I'm not even sure why i'm recommending it actualy. Maybe because i liked it a lot, even when it left me with a sour taste in my mouth.I'll try to give some pros and cons.Pros (?):+ Its a shooter / ""cRPG"" hybrid, and a pretty messy one if you're not into some kind of RPG background, but once you get the idea, its kinda cool.+ It has not the best graphics, sounds or music, and yet it gets the job done: it depicts a nasty, lonely and weird dystopic future with [Cyberpunk, Warhammer 40k, Alien, Blade Runner, Matrix, etc] elements. Cool mix if you ask me.+ It has a wide variety of weapons, armor, psi powers, cyber augmentation.+ The hacking minigame its cool. Hard to understand at first maybe.+ Campaign Co-op+ You are part of a faction within a secret order that works for megacorps against the Federation. It consists of Cyber-Psionic warrior-monks that look like Templar Knights and Samurai. YAY! Cons (?):- It throws you into some weird as ♥♥♥♥ situation and doesn't give a single ♥♥♥♥ about you. You're on your own. Tutorial you say? Mmmm... good luck with it. Yeah, sometimes it is a good thing, but E.Y.E. fails at execution here.- The save system may be a pain in the butt.- Pretty weird / bad AI.- The level design its great... but sometimes they are HUUUUGE and E M P T Y, devoid of any sign of life. Good concept maybe, terrible execution for sure.- Poor story and background development, althoug i like it (more about this later)- You are part of a faction within a secret order that works for megacorps against the Federation. It consists of Cyber-Psionic warrior-monks that look like Templar Knights and Samurai. WTF?I may be missing something, but you get the idea by now.Now, one last, important and HUGE point: the key is the ending. All this whole mess of a game makes sense (and be warned, not necessarily a good one) when you reach the ""end"". The actual one. After you've completed the game AT LEAST three times. This ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lets you wonder WTF just happened and, again, it doesn't give a single ♥♥♥♥ about you, your feelings, your expectations. Anything. And i like that. What were you expecting? This has some heavy cyberpunk influences after all!But seriously, the end demands you to think about the whole experience, something that not many games do.So, to get this to an end, should you buy E.Y.E?Only if you can see through some far-from-perfect indie game, if you like cyberpunk, weird and not so conclusive stories.If you're in doubt, wait for a sale.

												Editing-- and am early in my ""career"" into this one because it delivers.Only a few short hours into this unique experience of a RPG / FPS, and I find myself falling in love.There almost nothing missing, and thoroughly adds more to the genre than most (a sense of zone and melee as you will drop your gun barrel or blade low, for instance).Interface is a little bizzare and unoccomodating at first but is a beautiful tapestry of the art theme, to which this game looks grand and psychological.I immediately felt welcomed though with the tuturoials (wiki and community is really helpful and necessary), if not immediately challenged the dangerous world of E.Y.E. where an alien world is at the very heart of a surreal and deep plot of warring factions and hightened sense of mechanical combat.This game came out in a good year when FPS games were starting to spread wings, and this game flew sky high, if unnoticed by many.Recommended?  DEFINITELY!For everyone?  Not necessarily, I like the pace, but we pick our own poisons~But... if you enjoy cyberpunk, gothic / victorian themes, massive architecture, Blade Runner, Shadowrun, Warhammer, Deus Ex-like themes this game has the best and funnest features of each of these and is so pleasing to the eye.

												E.Y.E Divine Cybermancy.Man, what to say about THIS game.Is it a Warhammer 40,000 rip-off, or something else entirley?It is BOTH. E.Y.E. Divine Cybermancy is a First Person Shooter/Role Playing Game hybrid, that takes influence from Deus Ex, Warhammer 40,000, System Shock 1&2, Ancient Japanese Samuri lore (I think), and the book Dune.This is one of those games that comes along once in a while, that shows a REAL depth and attention to lore and universe in a way not seen since Halo, Warhammer 40,000 or Doom, but it too complex and confusing to really catch the E.Y.E. (pun intended) of the average gamer today. It is made at a time when people who mde games for the PC MADE it FOR the PC. As such you should remember 90% of the buttons on the keybord or use 5 different options menus.  So as you can tell, Deus Ex is a big influence on E.Y.E. You play as an Agent for the secret society E.Y.E. as they try to stop a fight between two rival factions.To be honest the story was confusing to me, and maybe if I spent more time focused and payed more attention to what's going on, I would of got the story.Like you REALLY have to be COMPLETELY FOCUSED and IMERSED into the story to make sense of it, and it can be a bit off putting.The gameplay is like Warhammer 40,000 meets Deus Ex. If you have played System Shock 1&2 and/or Deus Ex, you should know what to expect from this game.That's all I've got to say about this game.Play it. You'll either get a great & enjoyable experiance, or a confusing, unenjoyable one instead.Broken 3/5""A beutifully ambitious broken masterpiece""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love the open level design of the game which gives ya multiple choices on how to take on each mission whether it be charging head on guns blazing, or using stealth tactics to assassinate each target. Adding onto that exploration in each level is highly encouraged as  side missions, secrects, and such are to be had. The only drawback I see are that the UI may be a little overwhelming for new players, the translation from French to English is a bit shoddy, and the story can be quite confusing albeit intriguing. (Least to me anyway >.>)			",140,13,0,19,4,1,16

												Heres da thing. Its a grass roots indie game developed by a small international studio using the source engine. This means several things: bad translation, rough presentation, bugs, and a very dated look. The game sometimes feel more like a mod to another game, then an actual game of it's own. You would be tempted to think then,  that the game is rubbish. It's not. In fact, it's a blast. Because when things do come together (and they do more often then not) its a really well done piece with plenty ambitious ideas. I would warn you though, this game is not for the faint of heart or for those who expect to some level of handholding at first. This initially turned me off of the game years ago. I see now though, after sticking with it, this is a great game and if you are fan of cyberpunk-likes then I think you would enjoy it too.			",339,76,3,85,33,3,78

												This surprisingly well made game built on the Source Engine is challenging, fun, and a great multiplayer game. I bought a four-pack without knowing whether or not this game would be any fun. The learning curve, even for an FPS game, it tough due to it's rudimentary UI and RPG-hardened gameplay. Overall though, it's a great game that even RPG-haters like me can appreciate. The art style is the best I've seen on Source, and the singleplayer/multiplayer will keep you on for more than 40 hours.			",311,53,24,19,29,4,16

												Fantastic game concept, great models and textures and original sound effects. One of the most creative and original FPS games to ever be designed. It has a plot with a rich backstory!The downside? Unplayable. Endless waves of cheater AI destroy your character with no break in the abuse, from the minute you step into a level. No room for strategy. Just endless, pointless hack-and-slash....except your character is the only one hacked up and slashed. The skills system is completely pointless and you will never have the opportunity to use it--all you will be doing is taking a beating from an endless cavaclade of indestructible cheater-AI bots.I searched desperately for a patch, thinking the game had serious bugs that have since be resolved, only to find out that the gameplay balance is seriously broken by design. What a bitter disappointment. ",41,3,0,0,1,0,10

												For the price of the game, it's quite a deal (right now of course, when the deals' still on). The gameplay is heavily dependent on your play style, with new ""tools"" such as (hacking and psi abilities) at hand, you choose how you want to play and how you handle certain situations; stealth assassinations, rushes, hacking, and many more as shown in the trailer.The game is fun but can sometimes be a lil' frustrating due to the new key binds unlike HL2's (e.g. ""Activate"" is <Enter> as opposed to <e> in HL2). Also, with the new UI; weapons, skills, hacks and psi the game may be quite confusing to new birds however there are tutorial videos built right in the game.Weapons ranges from swords to shotguns to minigun but may be underpowered. Ammo is abundant as armories are almost everywhere.Graphics-wise is somewhat improved from the original HL2 series but not as good as current games.Game is still buggy but I guess it'll be fixed soon with regular updates as this is a promising game.

												  Such an interesting game. Sure it has literally the roughest start to any game I've ever played, but once you surpass that obstacle, you then realize you have found a game that you will remember for being so weird, interesting, and incredibly fun.  The amount of freedom you have to make your character strong is unbelievable, I ended up making a quick medic that uses heavy weapons, but dies quickly.  The story is very interesting aswell, atleast, if you enjoy reading in on alot of stuff. Though I highly recommend you do, it's certainly not one I'd forget anytime soon.  Sure graphics are dated, but the locations are so interesting, plus the music is pretty good, and sets the mood really well.  Also, it supports coop, coop generally makes things more fun, so if you can, bring a friend!  I highly recommend this game, it's weird, which is why I love it.			",119,14,0,15,7,2,4

												E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy is not really the best of games, but it really depends on what you enjoy. If you enjoy what sounds like a made up robot language, poop green backgrounds half the time, tedious and mediocre missions, hard to achieve achievements, and a rather boring and seemingly political (they talk about their politics all the dern time) campaign, then you clearly have no sense of fun, but might enjoy this.Anybody looking for a fun action game that doesn't require complex controls, you're out of luck and honestly won't find it here.I truly think it's both bad and good, you'd have to be really interested in the stuff in the first paragraph to truly love this game, but maybe there's something I'm missing5/10			",163,8,1,23,6,2,9

												A strange game of a sort you don't see much these days. Its core strength is the gameplay. The game sets you loose in large open levels, while providing an assortment of toys and powers to mess around in whatever way you see fit. In regards to the story it is better to just go with the flow, soaking in the atmosphere while not trying too hard to figure out what is going on. It isn't a game that will appeal to everyone, but in its own little niche it shines.			",163,47,4,46,30,2,27

												  Such an interesting game. Sure it has literally the roughest start to any game I've ever played, but once you surpass that obstacle, you then realize you have found a game that you will remember for being so weird, interesting, and incredibly fun.  The amount of freedom you have to make your character strong is unbelievable, I ended up making a quick medic that uses heavy weapons, but dies quickly.  The story is very interesting aswell, atleast, if you enjoy reading in on alot of stuff. Though I highly recommend you do, it's certainly not one I'd forget anytime soon.  Sure graphics are dated, but the locations are so interesting, plus the music is pretty good, and sets the mood really well.  Also, it supports coop, coop generally makes things more fun, so if you can, bring a friend!  I highly recommend this game, it's weird, which is why I love it.			",119,14,0,15,7,2,4

												This game is an absolute mess, but it's the best mess i've ever seen.The gunplay is horrendous, but at the same time ridiculously fun, from smg's with 1000 rps rate of fire, to revolvers that can take down gunships, to more sane weapons such as an assault rifle or a warhammer.The story and dialogue are completely screwed up, maybe because the developers are french(?) and probably used google translate for the text, it's some of the most profane and sometimes profound text i've seen in a long while.

Sure.A covert invisible infiltrator? Why not.A Big Guy with a warhammer and a minigun, staring the danger in the face as you obliterate them? Go on.Hacking the enemies to turn them against each other, avoiding direct combat whenever possible? Completly possible. Just be wary, THE DOORS CAN HACK YOU BACK. YES, YOU CAN BE COUNTER-HACKED BY DOORS.Becoming a cyberpunk magican to make your enemies explode while suffering from hallucinations? Got you covered.A more conventional FPS playstyle with guns and taking cover? WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT but yes you can.Go gain some Brouzouf.			",264,66,3,30,27,5,43

												A variety of characteristics and odd design elements that shouldn't work, but work amazingly.  Combat is fast paced like Doom, but with more modern elements (aim down sights, various psionic options, placable turrets...).  There's an RPG element sort of like Deus Ex, but not at all like Deus Ex.  It's translated from French, but intended to be a futuristic mode of speech, so it's hard to know what's translation errors and what's just supposed to be atmospheric.   Everything should make this a mediocre game, but it's amazing.  If you don't love this game you are probably a horrible person who hates fun.			",557,91,17,65,45,5,107

Product received for free
												I'll try to be a brief as possible.I literally don't know where to start, but i guess that the first impression that this game gave me is of a huge unfinished project; but I understimated whatever that got finished.This is a game that will take you from ""not knowing how to open a door"" to ""fight colossal monsters on the surface of mars"".And i think that the part of the game that got me involved the most was trying to figure out how the game worked; and of course the realisation that the key for a true experience was the replayability the game has, in which of course you have a vast variety of guns and skills to shape your style however you want. And of course a lovely progression system built around brouzoufs.To sum up.Play it, get frustated, keep playing, gain brozoufs, get some friends, check your legs, grain more brouzouf, enjoy.

												A simple yet impressive game that has one of the most interesting atmopsheres and feels to it of any game I've played. I would call the feeling I get from it similar to the one you get from the atmosphere from Dark Souls but different in it's own unique way to where it's not the same feel in an fps. As an avid fan of Warhammer 40k games this game gives you a seemingly copyright infringingly close experience to games of those vein but less of the Space Marine machismo and more of the simple pathetic human thrown against the tides of space. Game is rather unpolished, but that some how adds to it's charm in generating that unique feel. Overall 7/10, a bit of spit shine and polish of the game design, character advancement, and in a few other areas and would easily be 9/10, but still overall a very fun and rewarding experience.

												A strange game of a sort you don't see much these days. Its core strength is the gameplay. The game sets you loose in large open levels, while providing an assortment of toys and powers to mess around in whatever way you see fit. In regards to the story it is better to just go with the flow, soaking in the atmosphere while not trying too hard to figure out what is going on. It isn't a game that will appeal to everyone, but in its own little niche it shines.			",163,47,4,46,30,2,27

												A very strange yet unique and intriguing game.  The game has you playing as a secret agent working for a shadow corporation of some sorts working for another shadow corporation, I think.  The story and back story are the most interesting things in the game.  They did a very good job with the plot, history, and setting up an immersive world.  The gameplay is its weakest point but still very enjoyable if you spend the time to learn it.  What I mean by this is it basically just drops you into the game, with the ability to level, research, melee, sneak, hack, etc from the get go with an optional tutuorial that is confusing and doesnt explain things in well enough detail.Honestly it took me about 3 hours to learn how to play the damn game, but once you get there its a blast.  On normal it feels a bit easy though, balance is not this games best feature.  If you can get past its flaws in the gameplay, it has a very indepth story and universe that will make you play it for hours and hours.			",267,74,4,27,19,5,66

												E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy is not really the best of games, but it really depends on what you enjoy. If you enjoy what sounds like a made up robot language, poop green backgrounds half the time, tedious and mediocre missions, hard to achieve achievements, and a rather boring and seemingly political (they talk about their politics all the dern time) campaign, then you clearly have no sense of fun, but might enjoy this.Anybody looking for a fun action game that doesn't require complex controls, you're out of luck and honestly won't find it here.I truly think it's both bad and good, you'd have to be really interested in the stuff in the first paragraph to truly love this game, but maybe there's something I'm missing5/10			",163,8,1,23,6,2,9

												Not that impresses.  The game is heavy on text.  It throws out a lot  of names that I have trouble wrapping my name around.  It's like I'm in another world....where they speak....or at least have the translation...in english but all the names (hundreds of them) are wrapped  up into a complex story that doesn't make much sense.   Controls are NOT intuitive.  I'm really not too impressed.  There are too many sub-menus that you have to go through and it's too eqasy to die as you're trying to change wepons/tactics through the interface.  Also, there's no ammo counter on guns.  I pick up ammo, but it doesn't re-load the guns...I also can't re-load wepons.   A ""life"" counter would help.  Really a waste of money.			",204,40,1,8,6,0,7

												""Different"" is the best way to describe E.Y.E. RPG gameplay similar to Deus Ex with gunplay rivialing even the best FPS games of its time. A very deep RPG base has you  placing points in everything from Psionic Skills to Hacking Abilities along with upgrading your own cybernetic implants to let you run faster, jump higher, or even resist being hacked. E.Y.E has many different ways to deal with one problem and after a while of ""running and gunning"" you'll find yourself wanting to hack and corrupt your enemies or even mind contol them with your Psi energy, jedi style, to turn the tide of battle.

												If its not on sales dont bother yourselfrate :7/10This game make me pass few hours of fun shooting around but still its not worth the 2.90 euros i gave. despite the blades-katanas and the miningun that you can go berseker this game is really a game that you play more to go from one place to another rather than shoot or actualy do what makes you happy (killing)BEFORE YOU BUY IT BEWARE THAT GAME GOT TOO MANY CONSAnd here we go the cons are differnt though even if you want to enjoy this game the producers wont let you...1st) And propobly most annoying, in the game you get brouzouf (its the coins of game) even when you end the campain you got so few that you want to cheat to get some more for upgread's but the creators didnt make a cheat for this so you can unlock the 7-9% of 100%,  you will say its ok... NO ITS NOT you got to make reasherch in unknown type of thing that you find in game,upgrade biomechanisms of your body and buy upgrades for your body.... and when you get around 2-3.000 for a kill of reallyyyyyyyyyyy strong enemy when you go to the reaserch you should pay more than 70K to unlock it (in campain only you get around 240-320k), you can only gather more in free maps (the guy right guy when you are in airport will show you the maps availeble) 2nd) BUGS, yep you see it coming do you? this game can crash for no reashon happens 1/10 times that you will play it, if you go check another tab for example facebook and you reteurn to game its more likely to close than play and even if it go to play you will have visual problem with dialogs (all npc dialogs will be hiden and you will answer to their questions blindly) and letters will go either heavy bold or really small (in both cases you can barly read them)3rd) when you finish the game the game SEND'S YOU BACK FROM THE START , hell no, i aint gonna play over again the same missions with the same freaking objectives ( at least you continue with all of your stuff including upgrades etc)4th)HUGE F***** DISTANCES, its not cool when i must walk 1-3 killometers in average ( not mention that you should find the right way or else you will get your self in deadend) why you dont put one veichle, a teleport  or something at least tha it goes quicker than foot ( think that if you go heavy like me it will be a big pain in the arsh)5th) This is only for Achive hunter, when you play the game you got to choose (savegames are not exist to load back and take the achives) exept  the fact that you can only unlock some and only some of achives through the campain if you want to unlock more you should REAPLAY THE WHOLE GAME  and thats not all, you got be lucky as hell to find or to be accurate to spaw close to you a ""thing to kill"" for example the gray to take the achive (in few words,no matter how many times you play the game,if you are not lucky enough to spaw near you the huntable monster you wont get the achivement).... no more comments to add 5th) TOTALY BLACK, brightness is really low in this game even if you adjust it from the panel the world will be still darker than night withought moon and starsand nowpropobly you wonder why i am still recomend this game...Allthough this sh***t crap i really enjoy the plot of this game, especially in end that you find out that nothing that you belive as real is not.. really mess up huh? Still you pass all the campain solo with no other players add you BUT you can spaw 3 clones :D that will follow you althouth i pass a great time with my heavy sniper and took many headshoots... Some parts of game really travel me to another games for example in mars base with all this monster-type beast's the first thing came to my mind was Dead Space...And beacause i wrote too many i rate it 7.10 and i Recomend it ONLY IN SALES ( lower than 2.5 euros)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fkin awesome, dont unerstand why this game is not popular, graphic is good, gameplay is interesting. Darkpunk style of game is pretty good, sometimes spooky. Mission r fkin hard, when u need hack, buy u dont have hack skill. Perk and talent system is awsome, interesting. Some NPC are funny, for example Han in temple. Weapon and psi-force system is weird, but not bad, i think, than its good game at all. Buy it!			",55,5,2,1,3,0,0

												this is an awsome RPG first person shooter the art is great and the story lines not half bad ...once you piece it together that is. the great extramissions you can do to level up on makes a big help to prepair your charecter for the main mission/quest. theres all sorts of factions and being the cool merc. you play as you can join any group and then kill anyone ya wont.

												E.Y.E.: Divine Cybermany is an interesting game where the developers tried to cram as many features into it as possible. Best description I can come up with is the original Deus Ex with a healthy dose of Anarchy Online after binging on Warhammer 40k lore and William Gibson's Neuromancer. The Story takes place in the grim-dark of ""whatever the hell year"". You are an agent of the Culter Dei who is rivaled by and allied with Jian. Both who are part of E.Y.E, that is the militant portion of Secreta Secretorum. A cult/government/secret society. That everyone seems to know about. You fight against many different factions, each who hate eachother just a little bit less then you as they have no problem concentrating their efforts on you rather then eachother. There are the ""looters""; space pirates on bath salts, basically. The Federation. An oppressive government that is never actually shown ever doing any oppressing. Just trying to kill some cult fanatics, looters and ""demons"". And the ""metastreumonic forces"", who are... something. Demons, manifetations of emotions, nature fighting back. Take your pick.Gameplay itself is a  solid First-Person Shooter that will feel very familiar to those who have played the original Deus Ex at any lenght. If only a bit smoother. Your movement is influenced by everything. What you wear and carry, how advanced some skills and implants are and what kind of injuries you have sustained. Though at times it does feel like your character is moving on ice, it in general feels very smooth and well made. Controls can get a bit overwhelming at times as there are quite a few buttons to keep in mind. Movement, skills, leaning and weapon functions take up quite a bit and it can feel daunting to remember the essentials beyond movement but it is nothing too complicated. Character development is extremely deep with the stats system being influenced by the implants you have and their level of advancement, and what researches you have done with the randomly generated pickups that enemies drop every once in a while. Stats themselves seem to not have a cap as far as I have seen and the benefits they give just keep going up the more points you put in. To the point that if you go on long enough, you'll be jumping 20m into the air in the heaviest armor, wielding the heaviest weapons and running around at mach 2, absorbing rockets and armor piercing bullets with your face while your health bar refuses to budge. Best place for a Deadpool in Ironman armor imitation. Also to note is that when replaying the story, your character retains progress. Meaning every play-through will make you progressively more powerful as you level up and sink points and money into your skills and implants. The AI, however is both smart and stupid at the same time. Unable to open doors, but very capable of taking cover and flushing you out with expertly thrown grenades and not from Storm Trooper Scool. They are also completely incapable of any other action but charging right at you in combat. Thankfully the game lets you tweak how many enemies spawn and how often. But even on modest and lower settings the game can still sometimes feel like you were playing a first person StarCraft game against the Zerg as there will be a steady stream of tireless, seeking, flesh-missiles jumping out of walls behind you. Thankfully, even on the higher difficulty settings, guns are very capable in killing the enemy in a few well placed shots. Very little in the way of ""Bulletsponges"" in the game, though they exist. But you can also make yourself equally spongy and twice as deadly so it sort of balances out. The environments you go to are in general very bleak looking. Very dystopian, channeling Blade Runner and select few animes, but unique. Mostly urban landscapes, but with enough variety to allow you to play anything from a sniper to a melee fighter. And anything in between. The game's age does show itself in the art and textures. As does it show the age of the Source engine. At some moments you will notice very high quality textures and assets mixed in with some very simple ones. In fact some parts in the maps look more like they were made in the original Unreal engine. But You won't really have time to notice all that as you'll be hip deep in enemies who can blend into the environment. Enemy visuals tend to repeat as there are only a handful of head and body types per faction with a few additional attachments. But that still makes enemies more varied then in most other AAA titles currently on the market. In conclusion.This game is flawed. But it is fun. A convoluded but still followable plot demands that you play it through more then once and with the sheer mass of choices you can make in both dialogue and rest of the gameplay give a lot of replayability. Allowing you to become the warrior you want to be in any imaginable combination of skills and weapons or lack thereof. A solid game well worth the price and time to play. If anything, a guilty pleasure game to play when burned out on everything else. Wholly recommend.			",57,0,0,6,5,0,15

												By some french devs, it's an fps in a dystopian future with quite a bit of a shadowrun feel to it. It's a mod made with the source engine, the devs gave it plenty of content to warrant the cost.You can play it with friends, and it has a pretty dead online last I checked. The story feels very convoluted at first since the french weren't very good with english, after a few playthroughs you start to understand it more.Playing it alone is super boring, so get some friends to co-op it with.

												Fantastic game concept, great models and textures and original sound effects. One of the most creative and original FPS games to ever be designed. It has a plot with a rich backstory!The downside? Unplayable. Endless waves of cheater AI destroy your character with no break in the abuse, from the minute you step into a level. No room for strategy. Just endless, pointless hack-and-slash....except your character is the only one hacked up and slashed. The skills system is completely pointless and you will never have the opportunity to use it--all you will be doing is taking a beating from an endless cavaclade of indestructible cheater-AI bots.I searched desperately for a patch, thinking the game had serious bugs that have since be resolved, only to find out that the gameplay balance is seriously broken by design. What a bitter disappointment. ",41,3,0,0,1,0,10

												  Such an interesting game. Sure it has literally the roughest start to any game I've ever played, but once you surpass that obstacle, you then realize you have found a game that you will remember for being so weird, interesting, and incredibly fun.  The amount of freedom you have to make your character strong is unbelievable, I ended up making a quick medic that uses heavy weapons, but dies quickly.  The story is very interesting aswell, atleast, if you enjoy reading in on alot of stuff. Though I highly recommend you do, it's certainly not one I'd forget anytime soon.  Sure graphics are dated, but the locations are so interesting, plus the music is pretty good, and sets the mood really well.  Also, it supports coop, coop generally makes things more fun, so if you can, bring a friend!  I highly recommend this game, it's weird, which is why I love it.			",119,14,0,15,7,2,4

												I wouldn't get this for 9.99, but for 2.49 I feel like the sensation of total loss of understanding coupled with almost constant insano cyberpunk fps gunfire is sort of an o.k. cost even though the graphics arent great and something was lost in translation of something already weird.  I know thats a long sentence.  I also feel like it'd be fun to play coop, but haven't yet.  I think maybe a dead philip k. d-ck's ghost sometimes haunts individual games of this as they are being played live whether or not you are online.  I'm really using it like a ouija board to try to channel him. No joke people.  Plus, my legs seem to be ok now, which is a good thing.  I'm sorry but so far this is one of the strangest fps games I've played.Brouzoufs are good to have apparently.  Also, play the demo first so you know what you're getting into.  Seriously its the exact same WTF weirdness.  I played the demo for four hours and didn't understand anything going on it outside of shooting the guys who were trying to kill me, which is the only reason I bought this anyway.			",43,1,0,7,0,0,0

												EYE:Divine Cybermancy is this weird little pseudo-gem of a game. In a way it's like Deus Ex, but multiplayer, but also janky as hell and buggy to high heaven.The Plot:The story makes pretty much no sense at all, and all the characters are weirdly aggresive towards you if you ask questions-- even though it is established and widely known you have some sort of memory loss. ""Why would memory loss factor into the plot?"" you may be asking, well... that is because there is hardly anything in this game that it can expect you to understand. The plot is bonkers, things happen with no warning at all. It's sort of cyberpunk, but also sort of old-timey, but also sort of post-future-pre-futuristic (???). Basically the sort of plot where futuristic cyber-nuns fight a bunch of police officers but they use street-slang for some reason whenever they talk about them. The translations in general will make you go ""Um...Okay, I don't understand this at all."" and then a man with a gun will shoot you in the face and you will enter a coma. The maximum number of comas is 10, unless you upgrade your number of comas. Yes. Exciting.Gameplay:The gameplay has that floaty feeling that all source games seem to have, but there are lean mechanics, a hacking minigame, stealth, and a ton of augments. They're all fairly broken, but it's nice that they decided to pay a visit. Enemies will wreck you, this is a standard of EYE. Even if you upgrade your guns and armor, you are a fragile little pool noodle and your enemies shoot a million shots a second with pinpoint accuracy. At higher difficulty levels your augments will mean nothing (Unless you can always cloak, cloak is good).Overall:EYE:Divine Cybermancy is a janky, buggy, bonkers homage to Cyberpunk RPGs blended with a metric buttload of other things, pushed back and forth through google translate 7-10 times. If someone remade this game without the bad bits, and made some of the less fun features of the game (ie. Hacking is boring as hell, but you need it a lot) more fun, I would be in heaven. For now however, I highly recommend this game for a confusing, bonkers, but mostly fun experience.			",150,11,0,14,19,2,11

												The title and cover art alone are what pulled me to this game. However, once I started playing I was amazed. This is such an indepth game and one that is crafted with love. Shadowrun meets Elder Scrolls. One of the best games I have ever played and I have hardly touched it....I am in love.			",144,20,0,20,7,0,8

												You know, I actually bought this game when it came out, I still remember how the trailer showcased the different ways to defeat enemies. When I saw the dragon spell I was sold, who doesn't want to enter another's body in an explosion of gore? But that aside, this game has provided me with hours of entertainment, the characters are interesting and the storyline really draws you in, mix that with the almost trippy soundtrack and it will feel like everything IS just a dream. I must also say that it is awesome alone or with a friend, unfortunately the online servers are pretty much dead, so it is unlikely that you find a versus map. But if you do, it is really a blast. 10/10			",402,139,11,94,39,5,87

												E.Y.E is surprisingly complicated, and throws you into action without explaining what is happening. But with a little help from the tutorials that the game provides, and fiddling around with the key bindings, this becomes a fantastic game.The futuristic cyberpunk setting populated with raiders and monsters makes for an incredible atmospheric shooter game.You're probably going to want to look up a guide though, or things can get overwhelming. E.Y.E is definitely worth the brouzoufs			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A simple yet impressive game that has one of the most interesting atmopsheres and feels to it of any game I've played. I would call the feeling I get from it similar to the one you get from the atmosphere from Dark Souls but different in it's own unique way to where it's not the same feel in an fps. As an avid fan of Warhammer 40k games this game gives you a seemingly copyright infringingly close experience to games of those vein but less of the Space Marine machismo and more of the simple pathetic human thrown against the tides of space. Game is rather unpolished, but that some how adds to it's charm in generating that unique feel. Overall 7/10, a bit of spit shine and polish of the game design, character advancement, and in a few other areas and would easily be 9/10, but still overall a very fun and rewarding experience.

												A strange game of a sort you don't see much these days. Its core strength is the gameplay. The game sets you loose in large open levels, while providing an assortment of toys and powers to mess around in whatever way you see fit. In regards to the story it is better to just go with the flow, soaking in the atmosphere while not trying too hard to figure out what is going on. It isn't a game that will appeal to everyone, but in its own little niche it shines.			",163,47,4,46,30,2,27

												It's got more quirky bugs than a Battlefield game, and it crashes more often than my drunk ex-girlfriend's Honda Civic, but E.Y.E is a unique creation that demands multiple playthroughs to get the full experience. A decent game to waste away the hours while waiting for Deus Ex: HR to finally come out.			",670,158,23,80,35,6,86

												9/10 Would buy again.Probably one of the most underrated shooter/rpg/open world games out today.  The story behind this game is great and I love the combat system, solid controls and gameplay, great active online multiplayer, and community is still active as well. The campaign missions are very fun and can always be completed in multiple ways.  The combat in addition to the conversation choices you make in missions, or in-between missions, do inflict what happens in others, not only in conversation like what mainly happened in the Mass Effect Series with your background and initial choice with that, but also in events in some missions.  The combat is balanced, you can choose various types of playstyles from melee/close quarters, to sniping, and anything in-between.  There is a wide selection of weapons and even more enememies to kill as you play the game.There is a hacking mini game that can be as big or as small a part of the game as you want.  You can use your skills to upgrade your abilities to further gain information for a mission, enhance the story, or complete a mission in an alternate manner, it all depends on how much effort you put in.Solid online games and co-op as well. There are various Steam groups that do co-op events and online events.  The events that happen online affect your single player character as well.  You can level up online and increase your skills offline, and gain some small experience points and money for offline use, but the effects are still noticeable.This single player and multiplayer link means there is a sort of drm, in that the account your start your game with and use in your campaign will be the same one as online.  That being said, it is really just like a save game, you can have multiple ones and switch between then with ease.This game is worth full price, and if nothing else, just enjoy it for the multiplayer if you are not into that whole adventure story free roam kind of thing.*A feature I've found when I play that the only way the game saves is at the start of a mission, at least I haven't found a way to save manually, but the missions can be completed as quickly or take as long as you want, depending on how you play, so take that into account when you sit down for another go at gaming.

Standard controls are clunky, the tutorial is a joke, and the moment you train your crosshair on a target OMNIPOTENCE makes sure he shoots the ♥♥♥♥ out of you.			",348,83,8,38,18,2,44

												Bluntly - this game is a mess. Now, don't get me wrong: I love RPGs and FPS. I love Cyberpunk, sci-fi, Warhammer 40k, Blade Runner, Robocop, Deus Ex and pretty much everything else that this game was supposed to be a combination/comparison of according to other reviews.But the sad truth is that this isn't supposed to be some sort of insane, sci-fi acid trip; this is supposed to be an open world RPG with FPS elements, more akin to Fallout style game play, but instead what you get is barely intelligible English shoved into an over complicated plot and combined with FPS and open world mechanics from about 10 years ago.For example, if you do 1HP damage to a friendly NPC by accidentally setting off a power (which was poorly explained anyway), then everyone in the area will stop at nothing to kill you. You either kill everyone and annihilate any semblance of plot, or you die, either way it's game over. 20 minutes into the game, you'll suddenly find yourself doing a lot of reading as a bunch of characters start spewing the basic world premise at you. Various mysteries start to appear, relationships start to materialise, motivations become apparent... all within a few extremely large chunks of texts that are very difficult to decipher in broken English.It's not all terrible: the world itself is fairly interesting and original. I will not take that away from the creative forces behind this game - they have made something truly different which they are obviously very passionate about. And the saddest thing is that if this had been picked up by a large games developer and given a multi-million dollar budget then, wow, this game could have an instant cult classic.As is, it's just a big mess of outdated indie amateurism and I'm afraid to say that I think a lot of these good reviews just come from the fact that is a large and very cheap game - the kind of thing that appeals to kids and people unwilling to spend £30 on a polished, up to date title. So sure, if your gaming budget hasn't allowed for anything by Bethsada in the last 15 years, then get E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy and maybe you'll like it. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother.

												This is a dangerous game where you can suffer from the horrible disease known as Sulfatum addiction where you become bodily ill unless you are holding down the trigger on a bulky minigun gunning down lootersSulfatum addiction patients may also suffer from a holy-♥♥♥♥-this-smg-has-a-second-fire-mode complication with their disease, allowing them to violently eject their magazines through the barrel.Those with sulfatum addiction may recover, eventually becoming ridiculously fast blurs of katana-wielding death that simply don't need a gun to deal with anything the game throws at them.If you get past the gun fun, you can get yourself confused by the game's lore, which is surprisingly deep and has spawned some frustration and speculation from fans. There are also two levels that are cyberpunk enough to tide me over until Cyberpunk 2077 comes out. It's a rough game yes and it really shows sometimes but as a first mainstream game, it shows a lot of promise.Also, this game has a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of references. The devs must have had some fun making this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is just a surprise hitter in alot of ways. For alot of people, it's either a love or hate cause of it's style; it's a wierd mix of rpg/fps, and its own lore, but it's a REALLY great game in my opinion, and that's not even considering the multiplayer that's supposed to be awesome as well. I originally torrented this game honestly and then had it gifted to me, and I'm so happy to have it here, cause it's worth the buy fully, especially for a base price of $10 alone. The game can be pretty wierd, but funny as well in alot of ways, give it a shot! Cheers!~ Beeps			",225,47,7,27,24,1,20

												Some people want indepth RPGS.Some people want FPSes.This combines both in an experience that will drive you nuts. You can go in guns-a-blazing, go for a more stealthy approach, or just hack everything on the map. If you hack though, be careful. Things you try to hack will fight back, and can hack YOU. You will at one point in time, be hacked by a door. But that's the charm of this game. At the time of this review, it's ONLY A BUCK. Get it already!			",221,44,2,24,10,3,18

												E.Y.E. Devine Cybermancy - I was VERY sceptical about this game. It simply sounded too good to be true, the discription was too ambitious for it to work I thought. Than I've read that it was indie game made by 10 people.I was than SURE it's not going to be any good. Than I've read those 10 people were Franch, suddenly I thought - hah, it propably can't even be called a real game!What can I say? I was totally wrong, the game is actually genious, despite some flaws that I think will be repaired soon enough. The game is addictive, despite using old Source game, instead of UnrealEngine like ""the good stuff"" these days. Game is very complex at beginning, but after a while it's almost intuitive in every way. Creators also seem to be reacting to the community and they wish to perfect the game, so I can recommend this game to just about anyone - perfect blend of RPG and FPS, allows players to use different approaches, playestyles, solo or multi-player mode.IN SHORT: BUY IT!

												EYE: Divine Cybermancy has you fill the boots of a special agent working with a special forces group in a world strife with political backstabbing. That said, I wouldn't consider plot to be the biggest pull to this game. Between the wide variety of weapons, hacking, psionics, stealth, and mechanical augments, the game is a veritable playground, with each mission being able to be completed in a variety of ways: Slowly hacking into the augmented brains of your enemies and turning them into mindless slaves to act as your meat shields to wearing heavy armor and mowing down hordes with a minigun, or even using psychic powers to fling broken cars across the map. Perhaps the most alluring aspect of the game is the power the protagonist can obtain, vaguely reminiscent of Deus EX, you have no conventional classes, and your progressive character building eventually results in an incredibly powerful, flexible--or specialized--protagonist. The main campaign can be played alone, or with friends on LAN, moreover, there's competitive PvP gamemodes to keep things fresh. The game itself is fairly adequate in length, requiring six to ten hours to complete, but with endings for four complete playthroughs. Moreover, your characters will maintain from one gamemode to another, so if you play multi-player a lot, you can then port your character to the main campaign, or load it in to play with a friend in co-operative missions. As such, the same character can be made to play through the game multiple times, hitting ever high levels of power until you're jumping over apartment buildings and slicing through gunships with a Katana--that's also a demonic cyborg.If you enjoy things like Warhammer 40k, Ghost in the Shell, or Shadowrun, this is likely the game for you with its dystopian cyberpunk FPS/RPG themes. While the plot, gameplay, and atmosphere holds up for solo play, the game is best done with a group of friends.			",90,20,0,24,4,0,18

A lot of the ""pre-true endgame release"" theories went in hard and was real mind-bending♥♥♥♥♥♥ Even now I'm still a little lost, though it has been a while. The only downside I see is if you want to try out all the nice toys, it does require some grinding to get the money to earn it all. There's several different endings, one of which requires the others to be completed first. Anywho, this game is friggin awesome for how little it costs. Still think it's too much?

												Really unique game, I love the whole world. I feel as though they could make a second game with this exact same engine, maybe improve upon the general complaints like AI. They could also maybe modify weapons, or add others. The choice of weapons is excellent, it's not enormous, but with your limited inventory it defines your play style and you never really feel that confined or restricted in weapon choice. I do have to say that little things need to be tweaked such as the AI, maybe adding in a better tutorial. I feel as though the tutorial would be a huge improvement as this game does sort of throw you into it. But once you get into the game a bit, you learn as you go. For $10, I can't say that it's not worth the risk.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A very strange yet unique and intriguing game.  The game has you playing as a secret agent working for a shadow corporation of some sorts working for another shadow corporation, I think.  The story and back story are the most interesting things in the game.  They did a very good job with the plot, history, and setting up an immersive world.  The gameplay is its weakest point but still very enjoyable if you spend the time to learn it.  What I mean by this is it basically just drops you into the game, with the ability to level, research, melee, sneak, hack, etc from the get go with an optional tutuorial that is confusing and doesnt explain things in well enough detail.Honestly it took me about 3 hours to learn how to play the damn game, but once you get there its a blast.  On normal it feels a bit easy though, balance is not this games best feature.  If you can get past its flaws in the gameplay, it has a very indepth story and universe that will make you play it for hours and hours.			",267,74,4,27,19,5,66

												E.Y.E. Devine Cybermancy - I was VERY sceptical about this game. It simply sounded too good to be true, the discription was too ambitious for it to work I thought. Than I've read that it was indie game made by 10 people.I was than SURE it's not going to be any good. Than I've read those 10 people were Franch, suddenly I thought - hah, it propably can't even be called a real game!What can I say? I was totally wrong, the game is actually genious, despite some flaws that I think will be repaired soon enough. The game is addictive, despite using old Source game, instead of UnrealEngine like ""the good stuff"" these days. Game is very complex at beginning, but after a while it's almost intuitive in every way. Creators also seem to be reacting to the community and they wish to perfect the game, so I can recommend this game to just about anyone - perfect blend of RPG and FPS, allows players to use different approaches, playestyles, solo or multi-player mode.IN SHORT: BUY IT!

												Some people want indepth RPGS.Some people want FPSes.This combines both in an experience that will drive you nuts. You can go in guns-a-blazing, go for a more stealthy approach, or just hack everything on the map. If you hack though, be careful. Things you try to hack will fight back, and can hack YOU. You will at one point in time, be hacked by a door. But that's the charm of this game. At the time of this review, it's ONLY A BUCK. Get it already!			",221,44,2,24,10,3,18

												I dunno, man.On one hand, there's a large amount of grinding evolved. Enough that you will actually learn all the paths of the levels, which is a feat of itself! They're huge!The game is incredibly well done. It's very grim and dark, and carries a really strong tone of cyberpunk.It's absolutely a hot mess of game, I've more than a few times crashed near the end of grind-missions, and the story is hard to understand, even with a mod that translates the game better than the♥♥♥♥♥♥poor translation.Then you replay the first large city level and get completely immersed in the opening music track that play once you emerge from the door, and it all comes full circle.An absolute gem that only satsifies a few niche gamers, but something everyone should experience. It's basically deus ex anywaysThe first playthrough is absolutely awful if you take the path of Grey Master and become a jack of all trades. You end up majoring in nothing and it takes longer to unlock the things you want.After the first playthrough and character, the game immediately opens up. You can do nothing but put all points into one specific stat and actually main that stat, so you can become a pure hacker/PSI force user, pure tank, pure speed, anything.Amazing once you figure out the gameplay and how it works. Until then, however, it's very frustrating with deaths and stat loss on death sometimes and other things.Also, once you figure out that the real fun is having a low mental balance stat, it adds to it.

												E.Y.E is an obtuse and inane mess of half-baked ideas. It's an interesting idea suffocated by high concept and poor design. Nothing about E.Y.E is intuitive; the game would rather flood you with useless exposition than introduce you to new ideas in a digestable fashion. It's really a shame, too, because E.Y.E has potential. Stylistically, it's a standout title; it takes the cyberpunk aesthetic and drapes it atop a psuedo-knightly religious sensibility. It brings an atmosphere that is undeniably intoxicating. It offers players a number of options in regards to play style and objectives, which is always a point of praise in my book. Despite being visually engaging, the levels in E.Y.E are maddeningly large, sparsely populated, and there is no map function. Enemies are wildly inconsistent, in some missions you'll encounter colourful multiple armed creatures, the xenomorph from Alien and.. werewolves? There's no explanation. It just happens. The tonal shift is jarring, moving from oppressive looking storm troopers to colourful aliens and then back again without rhyme or reason.E.Y.E's story-telling is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ atrocious. I'm not sure if there's a good story in E.Y.E, because I understood literally nothing it threw at me. What's a Brouzouf? Meta-streumonic? Jians? Federation? It is a confusing mess of high concept sci-fi that seems more concerned with sounding exotic and unique than actually being comprehensible.I don't think E.Y.E is terrible. I actually think it's an okay game, but it's infuriating to see such potential muddied by avoidable design disasters. If the developers had eased the player into the mechanics and the lore, if they'd cut the fat off maps and made them compact and rich instead of large and vacuous, E.Y.E would be a knockout.I can't recommend E.Y.E. However, I really hope there is a sequel or follow up at some point, and the developers take the strengths of this game and pour them into something more carefully designed. I mean that. I hope this is just the beginning, and that in the near future we get to experience this world again.			",176,13,2,9,12,0,25

												Althought the concept of a farflung (or alternate) time when religion and technology are one and the same is intriguing, the game itself is horrid. The UI is clunky, at best. The dialogue (since it's mostly an rpg, there's a ton of it) is all in large blocks of text using language that's sort of confusing at first (they don't speak english). The controls are abyssmal. The inventory managment is pretty damned bad, as you can only fit the guns and ammo you need into a weird man-shaped block set up, as well as being required to look directly at whatever you want to pick up, which sucks during combat. And we come to the center of the shrubbery maze. For also being an FPS, the combat is terrible. A silenced sniper head-shot from far enough away that the second zoom must used to see the target, WILL draw every infintly spawning enemy from the entire area. Once you're spotted, there is no hiding. They will find you. As a disclaimer, this is being typed out after playing it for hours and only getting to level 9. I'm hoping my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ time is because the attempted stealth/hacking play style isn't well suited to being low level, or I just can't figure out how the hell to level up in the way I want to. If it ever goes on sale again for $5 or less, try it, until then, avoid it.			",273,57,3,33,26,1,43

Ugly HUD, awkward UI (no button for inventory, seriously?), ABSOLUTELY no save/load (only in the beginning of the missions) and lack of actually useful in-game guide.The guys REALLY should learn a thing or twenty about game design before going to Steam!

												This game has some very cool ideas, but overall, poor excecution. The setting and atmosphere are wonderful (despite the relatively unsophisticated graphics), and the soundtrack does well to create a unique experience. The RPG elements of this came are complex, offering a great amount of potential depth. However, said elements remain mostly unexplained, which leads to confusion on the part of the player. This is most apparent when it comes to the 'hacking' minigame. The poorly translated dialogue and abstract plot only add to this effect. My biggest gripe, however, is the ending. The finale of any game ought to be reminiscent of standard gameplay; the player feels a sense of mastery, while their newly acquired skills are put to one last test. E.Y.E. mostly consists of sparesly populated levels, in which the player engages generic enemies in small numbers. The final level thrusts you into fighting groups of over a dozen concentrated enemies, with little warning or preparation. After slogging my way through the boss fight (a big mob of generic enemies with one slightly tougher generic enemy in the middle), I discovered that the true ending is only possible after completing the entire campaign thrice. I have no desire to work my way through the same levels again. I promptly uninstalled E.Y.E. ",21,2,0,1,0,0,0

												This game is exceptionally flawed. It is incredibly confusing both in terms of mechanics and storyline. It also attempts to emphasize stealth but all of the enemies automatically know where you are at all times. Even if you are crouched and moving silently, enemies will run around corners firing shotguns at your head before you can react.Just go play Deus Ex: Human Revolution if you want a good game in this genre. EYE Divine Cybermancy is nothing other than a monumental disappointment given how good it could have and should have been. Not worth the $2.49 that I paid for it.			",170,27,2,32,8,1,16

												It's like an insane over the top Deus Ex, stuffed into a Serious Sam game, heavily inspired by Warhammer 40k, made by people who a) don't speak English and b) are French.Don't mistake this for merely a pretty jolly game, it's one of the best FPS campaign experiences on Steam. Like Serious Sam, Duke 3D and so on before it, the entire game can be played in coop. The not very long campaign has a few branch situations, and in general mission objectives are slightly flexible as to which ones you complete and how you go about it, so the game has a whole bunch of replay value. You can play as many playthroughs as you want with your character.The game isn't afraid of being hard and making you die, and as there's semipermanent (i.e. not easily fixable) death penalties eventually, it also strongly encourages playing well.Be aware that singleplayer and multiplayer campaign progress are saved separately in your character file, so you cannot start a game on your own and continue with others (unless you start it as a MP game and play alone). One player is the campaign host in multiplayer, this is separate from the actual server host.(There's also competitive MP nowadays, but I don't think anybody's ever played it.)

												I've tried to like EYE, I really wanted to like EYE. I waited for the game to be patched, I've tried the fan text revamp. But in the end the entire game is just so obtuse, esoteric, and poorly put together it just all falls apart.The levels are often far too large for what is in them (the hub level is this to the extreme), and and the lack of a map and any clear indicators as to what is intercative or not adds more confusion along with the poor lighting. The enemy spawn system is a nightmare and the gunplay is ok at best. The plot is also a gibbering mess that would give Stanley Kubrick a headache.In the end I'd give it a 3.5/10			",253,23,2,29,20,0,17

												I honestly don't get this game. I like the visual style and the cryptic atmosphere, but nothing else in it is compelling enough for me to play it.I don't see how this is an RPG. Because there are stats and you occasionally get to pick an answer in a cringeworthy dialogue? Maybe 4h is not enough to judge, but from what I've played this is a shooter, and not a very good one at that. There's nothing terribly wrong with it, but the interface is very clunky and everything else is just kinda mediocre. The psychic stuff seems kinda nice, but thanks to the clunky interface I was just shooting everything with the same gun and it worked 100%. Ammo is effectively unlimited, every mission has a ""gun case"" where you can pick up whatever you like, as long as you bought it (just once) earlier in your base. You also respawn when you die, I think it has limited resurrections, but I just don't feel like playing to find out what happens when you run out. Enemies respawn too. It's like they were designing a multiplayer only shooter and then changed their mind and tried to make a singleplayer/co-op game with a story, but it was already too late to fix the gameplay to reflect that (or to add the story for that matter).The game does a terrible job at explaining anything, which is acceptable when it comes to the story, but less so when all you get in terms of tutorial is a collection of short video presentations on some gameplay subjects. They didn't even link the videos to what's happening in the game, it will just occasionally say “press T to view tutorial” when it really means “press T and pick the right video from the list for this situation, we couldn't be bothered to do it”.If you want to play a shooter in a weird setting with a cryptic (or maybe just poorly explained) story and you get this on sale for 1€/$ like I did, it's maybe worth a shot, you're not risking much, but I don't recommend it.

												I've tried to like EYE, I really wanted to like EYE. I waited for the game to be patched, I've tried the fan text revamp. But in the end the entire game is just so obtuse, esoteric, and poorly put together it just all falls apart.The levels are often far too large for what is in them (the hub level is this to the extreme), and and the lack of a map and any clear indicators as to what is intercative or not adds more confusion along with the poor lighting. The enemy spawn system is a nightmare and the gunplay is ok at best. The plot is also a gibbering mess that would give Stanley Kubrick a headache.In the end I'd give it a 3.5/10			",253,23,2,29,20,0,17

												E.Y.E. can be described in only one sentence:""great idea, horrible esecution"".It has some neat ideas, like the way you can customize your pg and loadout, but it lacks ""the gasp"". You have to dive in the lore trough not exactly the best speeches ever written to understand what the hell is going on around you. And even then, all you'll get will be a sad excuse of lore, a more cybernetic Warhammer 40k like universe, twisting and collapsing around its fallacies.And don't let me start about the gameplay and the mechanics. GOD, the level design is boring, the AI's just plain dumb and, since it seems to run on a capped version of the Source Engine, random things, borderline enough to not be called glitches, will happen.Tl;dr: sendthisasagifttoyourworstenemy/10			",111,33,0,18,15,0,37

The dialog was so vague and long that the story was hard to follow and make sense of. Visually, you were knights with guns on mars fighting robots.

												It's entirely possible that with a group of friends and a lack of other games to play, I could get into this, but as it stands I have so many other things that are so much more worthy of my time.From the little I've played, gameplay is stilted - all the environments and levels are too large for how slowly you move, completely breaking the flow of the combat. Guns are vastly more effective than melee weapons, as I often died just getting into melee range. You expel the remainder of your clip when you reload, which leads me (as a compulsive reloader) to accidentally lose all my ammo. The writing is... 'poor' is an understatement. It's clearly a bad language port. No real story is given, literally every npc I met was absurdly rude to me, and it was generally just a really poor experience.			",124,24,1,8,13,0,16

Game breaking bugs; my quest giver kept falling through the floor or randomly aggroing on me.Overall when it works its quite fun, but the constant bugs and infuriating controls and menus just make it almost unplayable.

												I could insert a few jokes about how EYE blew my feeble mind and thusly, is the deepest game with the most horrid translation ever and you NEED the (♥♥♥♥♥♥) translation to understand 5% of the story. You're wrong, and i'm right, the story is easily understood lest you need open brain surgery, in which case my condolences. If not for the decent Source-esque gameplay, then the locales, atmosphere and audio design will please you, as it did my nether regions plenty of times. It's constantly on the  cheap, and hopefully the few dosh each purchase makes encourages Streum On™ Studios™ to keep pushing for total global frenchination. They have my support at least.

												Terrible characters and translation issues climb atop a mountain of poorly explained gameplay to create E.Y.E., one of the most frustrating and enjoyable games I've played. There is a great deal of depth here, but the only help comes in the form of boring, mostly useless video ""tutorials."" However, even if you watch the videos and reference the community, you will still likely find yourself making mistakes to the point of needing to start the game over entirely. Research this game a great deal before purchase; I recommed an excellent review/analysis by a guy named Sexbad on youtube:

												AN HORRENDOUSLY BAD  PILE OF RPG/FPS OFFAL: Everything about this game says amateur. A disjointed, odd and hashed together plot. An unintuitive interface that feels unfinished and just plain BAD. The characters and scenario are ripped off from other games, particularly Warhammer 40K and Duece Ex (according to others) Very disappointing in every way. I cannot understand why people like this game. Too bad I didn't see the the available DEMO before paying $10. THIS IS CRAP			",30,8,2,2,2,0,4

												I came into this game knowing it wasn't going to be extremely great. It has a neat universe that is intriguing, and I like the cyberpunk kind of stuff.   First off, creating your character in the very beginning is a hassle, I had to look up what each ""chemical"" would do.Another thing, hacking is crazy difficult, and boring, yet it seems to be one of the main points of the game.Enemy AI must have X-ray/something-vision, as soon as I start one of the maing missions of the story (where you have a choice to be stealthy) the enemy is shooting and converging on me within walking two feet into the map. (mind you I have a sniper rifle and cannot hardly see the enemy from across the map with my scope 2x zoomed.)It's neat to explore around the game, and other than the very odd AI and leveling system ect, it's really fun to use the powers and watch the enemies tweak. And the gun play is good as well.Haven't done much multiplayer but it's seeming like this is going to be more of a multiplayer game for me.Overall it's a neat game, if it goes on sale get it, I bought it for one dollar so i'm not too bent out of shape, more dissapointed than anything.

												I don't realy recommend it or don't but im leaning towards recommending it a litttle more, the game has the aspects of borderlands , it VERY glitchy at times, bugs in the game that most likely aren't going to be addressed due to the fact that the devs have put their full attention in another game, so If you don't mind getting put on a map going and fullfilling missions moving back and forth OFTEN then be my guest, the game does offer a interesting skill/leveling system, and not so overpowered money making system as well, and multiplayer isn't so bad the community's well rounded but maps often fail due to bugs  ( example: your on a mission it requires you to kill all enemies and you guys have killed them all but the game doesn't wish to give you the mission complete because an enemy spawned in a wall or didn't register when killed or it just doesn't wanna move on to the next map)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, E.Y.E is certainly something. It's a shooter with great upsides, and downsides, so only buy this if you feel the good outweighs the bad (i certainly do)Pros:-Interesting class system, your class is determined by the skills and augmentations you get, and not vice versa, and doesent really affect anything aside from giving you an aesthetic title - there is no actual limit to the combination of powers/augmentations you can get.-Good cyberpunk/surreal atmosphere - not many games have that kind of feel-Massive levels, with multiple paths for completion of each mission, so you can play it the way you want (you don't have to fire a single shot if you don't want to)-Fast paced gunplay, and action-packed awesomeness (you can jump onto a helicopter, shoot some guys below you, backstab the helicopter and jump off as it falls to its spiralling demise)-You play as a psychic cyber ninja monk paladin with amnesia who everybody seems to despise for no reasonCons-The story is completely and utterly insane, half the time i hve no idea what the hell i'm doing, or why i'm killing who i'm killing-Death is punished a little too harshly - i mean seriously, permanent stat debuffs? (well, I say permanent, there IS and endgame way to cure them, but as I said, it's endgame)-Enemies have ridiculous accuracy, though it is quite amusing to suddenly get sniped from accross the map by a bandit with an unscoped SMG-Playerbase is essentailly dead, so multiplayer (which is actually quite enjoyable) isnt really playable anymoreOverall Verdict:EYE is a game that seems to have been born out of the eldritch realm of Cthulhu during his reign of madness, but if you can see through all its unpolished edges and random shenanigans, you will find a unique game that you will not regret buying. (also, it costs only 10€, so why the hell not?)			",87,1,0,5,2,0,4

												This looks like it could be a good game but sadly after multiple tries I have no clue as to who I am, what I am doing, how to use skills like cyber jump etc. I can pick up a weapon and shoot it though. So that's about it really as I can't seem to progress and die many times trying. So seems like a good game that sadly takes many times more effort trying to work out how to play than actually play.Keeping that in mind I, strangley perhaps, still recommend it.

												AN HORRENDOUSLY BAD  PILE OF RPG/FPS OFFAL: Everything about this game says amateur. A disjointed, odd and hashed together plot. An unintuitive interface that feels unfinished and just plain BAD. The characters and scenario are ripped off from other games, particularly Warhammer 40K and Duece Ex (according to others) Very disappointing in every way. I cannot understand why people like this game. Too bad I didn't see the the available DEMO before paying $10. THIS IS CRAP			",30,8,2,2,2,0,4

												Not recommended for more casual gamers, certainly. I tried liking it, and though I saw some potential here, it was wasted by the game itself. Unusually stupid a.i., bad sound design, bad weapon balance, and overly complex menus are some of the more off-putting elements that made this game a novelty that wore off quickly. I didn't even bother attempting to delve more deeply into the story elements of the game, it seemed to be just a plagarized, inferior version of sci-fi tropes that I normally like.This game's greatest strength is the number of ways you can customize your character as you level.This game's greatest weakness is that you'll never be able to do anything else with your cool character than play in this boring, vapid, derivative world.

												This game is extremely weird... But also extremely cool. Genetically enhanced samurai-mafia and militia-gangsters and lots of science-magic! I have no idea what's going on in the game, but I think it's fun and makes somewhat sense. It's a bunch of skills you can upgrade, which in my opinion gives you alot of character-personality. I believe there is some kind of varied play-style, by for example summoning a bunch of cyborg-ninjas to fight for you, or you could run and gun. You can even just take the use of a mother♥♥♥♥ing hi-tech longsword that when you right-click, you summon a big♥♥♥♥♥vortex-shield that blocks of incoming bullets. And when you have blocked a few bullets,♥♥♥♥♥♥gets real and then you can play shadow-ninja and blink behind the enemys back and stick the blade up their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s! The only downside is that it lacks the biggest feature; weapon customization! The multiplayer contains jumping and a little bit of drugs... Fun! The games atmosphere is also quite cool-i-ool on the Source-engine.Ducks in sewers; 7/10.It's♥♥♥♥♥♥cheap, buy it! Buy a few copies to your friends and threaten them to cut of their ears if they don't try it!			",255,16,7,13,17,1,17

												Very ambitious game with amazing visual design and a fairly interesting plot that requires multiple playthroughs and possibly a few visits to some discussion threads. There is a lot the developers tried to do here and much of it ends up falling short, but even when taking that in to consideration it manages to be a more interesting game than many of the titles you'll see on the front page these days. With more time and a larger budget I'm sure this would have turned out to be something really amazing. The price is always criminally low during sales so if you ever see it at 80-90% cop this♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, it's probably the best dollar or two you'll spend all year.			",242,54,2,37,9,0,23

												First off, what I love about this game, is the open-ended craziness. What do you do? Where do you go? WTF is that thing?! At every turn you are shown something new and wierd. It never ends. As for difficulty, very hard. It's not just relfexes though, you have to use your ""brain"" to solve puzzles or track down an npc. And if you get surrounded, get ready for the fight of your life. This game is for the hardcore only. All others, go back to CoD.			",71,0,1,3,1,0,18

												A game experiance not unlike trying to juggle banie babies inside a tumble dryer full of bowling pins. with a story so convoluted and twisted, one is reccomended to bring along some heavy gin or asprin should you dare to try and understand it. clumsy video tutorials you need to shift through one by one make it difficult to get a clear understanding of the controls. areas and setpeices that seem devoid of life, not helped by the fact that all enemies spawn constantly and run at you in droves (usually in a straight line with no attempt to take cover) and an insanity system that seemed to effect me so badly I was unable to even read the instructions on how to rid myself of the madness induced blurry screen.Granted many of these things may be seen as positive things, and to be fair I did not play too far through, and for al it's faults this game is interesting if nothing else. give it a try on a sale but do not expect a warm welcome from E.Y.E.

												An interesting world, with a very unique art style and it's all ruined by frustrating controls and bad voice work. I really tried to enjoy the game, which promises to be a new-Deus Ex sort of game where you can pick and choose exactly how to develop both as a character and narratively, but between limitations of the Source engine and the controls, I simply could not enjoy myself.

												I've tried to come back and play this game several times since I first got it, but i can never make it more than 10-20 minutes before I get frustrated and quit. I can't recommend this game any more than I can properly review it as I haven't really played it. Everything I've read about this game and the trailers I've seen of it make it look really good, but from my personal experience, it's too confusing and clunky. All I've done in this game is create my character and make it to where the first enemies are. I've never seen them, but I can hear them shoot at me and their bullets end up killing me. aside from moving, jumping, and slashing with my sword, I'm not sure what there is to do in this game. I keep thinking I need to come back and give it a fair chance, but I can't bring myself to do it. I simply don't see the appeal. It mentions a multiplayer aspect and maybe that's why people play it. As for me, I only got it because it was on sale for $1. I don't plan to beat this game or do much more with it and I don't recommend it unless you think it's worth your time to try and  figure it out.			",229,55,4,55,24,1,35

												This game isn't that complex really.  You pretty much have 4 or 5 options.  You can be a use psy powers to summon clones or teleport into battle, you can run around with a sword and deflect bullets, you can build yourself into a cyber warrior that can jump 500 feet in the air and throw cars, you can hack enemies and atm's taking direct control and you can be a gunslinger that headshots everyone. If you want, you can also lay down turrets and send around drones that will also help kill guys for you. You can be a mix of any of those things if you want. The game definitely has it's own lore and terminology and it really has so much going for it in a first person shooter it may be confusing. All of that being said, the game is open, your choices send you into new stages you may never have seen, and to truly beat the game you have to beat it 3 different times allying with 3 different forces and gaining 3 different superpowered psy powers.  One thing that I wasn't expecting with this game is that for the vast majority of it enemies spawn endlessly, you can customize the frequency of it but keep that in mind as it does make a difference. It's also important to note the game is incredibly insane.  Seriously, it's very crazy.			",580,77,5,86,30,2,72

Product received for free
A game like french womenMade in 2011 but its no skyrim - visually. With a disgusting and clunky interface only french male are able to use. But if you overcome the french strangeness it will ease your pain for cyberpunk since the genre seems dead.Its like with french women. You dont get what they're talking about and you won't call em beauties at the first sight but with time they may teach you real passion ... but first you have to go to the library and restore your memory! To do that spend -75% or less Brouzouf on your steamy psi dealer don't ya dare do pay more!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great atmosphere, challenging missions and good gameplay (thanks to the source engine), but at the end of the day it feels like a mod because so many things have been directly transported from the Half-Life series. Sometimes I think the developers suffered from delusions of grandeur when designing this game and have obviously missed a lot stuff. The game is also ridden with bugs at the moment but there is some hope on that matter, as the developers are listening to the community and acknowleding the bugs - but it needs much more than one patch to be actually good. Right now, it will be good for a small percentage of hardcore sci-fi/atmospheric shooter fans like myself. Fans of games like S.T.A.L.K.E.R. might find it good as well, because the punishment you'll take here is just as high...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Im in Australia. I was bored one night and i paid like $2 for this game i think?Well....... If you are thinking of buying it because it so cheap - Do not. Simply don't. I cant understand anything about the game because its broken? It must be, there's no way a game could be this stupid. Even the menu system is down syndrome authentic. If your looking for a shooter where you vs other players, wont find any games here. And when u do it will render a few hundred ping too lagy. The maps will also be down synd'er, plus if u don't play single player you only get to use the poorly made melee weapon that like trying to swat a fly with a samurai sword. (In zero gravity) (when the fly is not effected by the zero gravity) <- LOL?If your looking for an adventure game with lots of loot. You will not find any here. Simply because I don't know how to start the game mode that lets you collect & use guns for multi-player, nor do I have the patience to bother trying longer then 30seconds or 5 clicks of my mouse.Im not that low to ask for a $2 refund but its the principal... Why would you even give such a 'I don't give a ♥♥♥♥' company a dollar? OR EVEN TWO! $$?Take this game, throw it in the recycle bin & don't even bother un-installing. Money hungry savages, they had 1 man working on this game I would bet.  Its that crap.In all i cannot give more of an accurate summery for this thing they call a game. Only played twice, 10mins each time.It now rests in the recycling bin. In its new home. Congr@s what ever the name of the company is. by the way, the word cybermancy sounds like the name for a homosexual favour robot. Or a cast-able spell from World of Warcraft. Zero points for everything.That bring you to a total score of:♥♥♥♥ing get this game off steam.			",73,0,1,12,7,0,17

												Typically, bad games make the player realize how bad it is about halfway through. E.Y.E. is a bad game, but at least you realize how bad it is right from the begining. I guess that is actually a pretty polite thing on the developers part. So at least there's that.The game starts you off in a character creation screen with no idea what you're doing. You see a bunch of stats and 3 gene code things which modify the stats in different ways. It's really complicated and totally overwhelming. You have no idea what kind of character you're creating or what he will be good at. A good RPG needs to have a helpful and clear character creation screen so players know what kind of character they are creating. You don't want to absolutely overhwelm them so they don't know what to pick. The exception, of course, is games based on rulesets that already exist like D&D or Shadowrun, which for EYE is not the case. When you finish with that you get thrown into the actual game without any kind of backdrop. You have no idea why you're there, what you're doing, or even who you are. An npc starts talking to you pretty quick but it must be some foreign language or made-up language because I didn't understand it. (An extremely bizzare stylistic choice). Thankfully, there are subtitles but its distracting to read them while you're playing! When you finally have an actual conversation nobody tells you what is going on. The writing is really, really sloppy too. The NPC's don't act like real people, more like robots in a museum (they just spit lines of dialouge at you without any emotion.)If you play RPG's you know what I mean when I say that the game needs to immediately draw the player into the game right off the bat. You want them to know what is going on and get them interested so that they will want to continue playing. You don't want to confuse them and make them feel lost. These are the barest basics, and yet EYE fails at it. The gameplay mechanics, such as hacking and leveling your character are also pretty confusing. You get tutorial videos that try to help you out, but they move too fast and aren't voice acted. There are subtitles but they moved too fast for me to read. As far as I'm concerned, the tutorial videos are useless. EYE has the lowest budget and worst design I have ever seen. It's like the developers were ADD high school kids who made it in a week on 100 bucks.			",67,21,0,24,2,0,15

												This is a horrible Deus Ex clone coded in the Source/Halflife 2 engine. Missions are a bit weird (and some maps are TEDIOUSLY large), hacking mechanics are stupid, combat is dumb, stealth is impossible, and you will die before you figure out what is killing you far too often. Also the story-telling ends up coming off as convoluted instead of mysterious. While EYE would probably be a little more enjoyable in multiplayer, i don't see why anyone would ever encourage their friends to get this game.			",314,74,4,58,20,1,43

Prepended edit: The wasted potential I'm seeing the more I think about this game is getting to me. This is one of the most love/hate reviews I've ever written. I'm going to try one more time to salvage this. I'm going to find a translation mod. I'm going to screw with the reinforcement settings and try to turn off the nonsense without making the game trivial. I'll try one more time and update the review accordingly if anything comes of it. But I'm not getting my hopes up.Phase 1: Already seeing issues with the  text revamp mod. I like how clean the dialog and UI text is made in places it needs it but it kind of changes the characters and lore in a way I don't think the developers would appreciate. This is why I said it wasn't enough.Phase 2: Even turning down the reinforcements to minimal and checking the ""limit reinforcements"" box results in getting mobbed and having enemies spawn behind you (this is something source is know for, but usually authors utilize such spawning in a better way). I've seen this compared to Diablo or other ARPGs but that's not true. Usually in these sorts of games the mobs don't spawn behind you and are limited per floor. Not the case here.Phase 3 (final): One more thing to add. The branches of the dialog trees tend to merge quickly. Meaning that oftentimes something you choose to say will get an equivalent response to the other option. This is fine and lets you have some roleplaying but the problem is understanding when those branches are going to merge and in the cases where they do lead to different responses understanding if those branches are hostile and lead to you getting shot several hundred times. This is not an easy task given the localization. Besides that, the hacking minigame (mentioned below) has a lot of potential (like the rest of the damn game) but the implementation needs work. The AI's algorithm relies heavily on a loop of overflow (increase your attack at the cost of defense) -> Attack -> Shield (raise defense). This is quite exploitable since they bring down their own defense so much. You can get it stuck somewhat in a loop by continually masking (reducing enemy attack), overflowing and then attacking. It seems to put a lot of priority in its attack points which lead to its downfall.So yeah, consider all of the above when you read the main review and remember that I gave it a hell of a chance and tried to love it as my time proves. But like Frozen Synapse it rejects me utterly.----I've never played a game that claimed to be cyberpunk and felt so disappointed. This is Serious Sam without the competence of croteam. Seriously, the RPG parts are impossible to understand because of bad localization (which makes speaking to NPCs and other lore pointless) and in the end the character leveling and such doesn't even matter because the enemies spawn endlessly and have no real identity. There is an option related to enemy reinforcements but that doesn't change that the combat is very badly done.I tried hard to like this because on its face the lore looked interesting and I enjoy it when games don't stick their head up their♥♥♥♥♥trying to do full voice acting (text allows much greater detail, like it or not). I tried hard enough that I played for 5 hours and dealt with aforementioned combat, broken Russian english and mildly annoying UI. Through those 5 hours I still feel as if though I'm not understanding much. Be it gameplay or plot related. Despite carefully trying to read all the archive logs, NPC dialog and every tutorial video I feel as if though I missed a ton of stuff.I'd rather play Fallout honestly, and I would be if I wasn't so afraid of the massive timesink it tends to turn into.Also, I couldn't help but notice that this borrows quite a few concepts from other stuff. Which is fine but honestly the plot isn't anything special. Nor is the backstory. From what I (barely) understand the early years of the game world was something akin to Warhammer 40K. Right down to them mentioning psykers by name and how the army would hunt them one way or the other and the ones that don't join willingly are killed sooner than the ones who do.I will say this much though. I loved the hacking system. It's just about the closest thing yet to what I've always wanted one to be. It's like a combat in itself with status text and attacks and everything. It's not just a dead simple ""you hack this, connect these stupidly easy dots, you get monies"" sort of deal. That's part of the reason I wish so desperately that this was better in every other regard. There's some technically interesting stuff hiding behind all of this somewhere.Edit: After thinking on it for a while. I can only summarize it thusly: The most truly depressing thing about it is that if they had did a decent localization. I could deal with all of this and like it even. No. Fan made loc patches aren't good enough for this much stuff. You need the authors' original intent carried over directly as best as possible. As is it you basically just randomly fight through the masses to get to whatever waypoint and figure out what to do by whatever vague hints you get. Then do stuff, then repeat without ever actually knowing what you're doing.Super duper final edit: 14 hours. I've tried for 14 hours to convince this game to let me love it. It's not working. I've uninstalled it and reinstalled it 4 times now. Now I'm not joking. I seriously did. Every time I attempt to play again I just see the insta-spawn enemies mobbing towards me and the incomprehensible dialog I think ""Hrm, I could be playing New Vegas right now"".  Even the hacking lost its novelty once I discovered the rather simple pattern of the AI. Probably going to do the final uninstall now.			",212,50,0,19,13,1,17

												I purchased this game two hours prior to writing this review. I paid 99 cents for it. I've played it for less than half an hour.In that half an hour, I walked through a portal, found myself in an ugly cave, fought an ugly beast, spent a significant number of minutes trying to understand confusing tutorials, cursed the horrible menu design, dual-wielded katanas, shot some dudes in the face, shot some more dudes in the face with a different gun after stabbing some other dude in the back, almost got killed by a sniper, leveled up some abilities, made it to a friendly temple, accidentally punched a friendly guy in the face, and proceeded to get murdered 4 times in a row while trying to figure out how to tell the exceptionally large number of people shooting at me that I didn't mean it.10/10... would get murdered repeatedly while not understanding a single thing that's happening again.

												It took me a long time to get into this game, but the end result is still disappointment. I really like the Blade Runner meets Deus Ex (original) vibe this game was going for. I think it pulled that part off spectacularly well. The gunplay is also visceral and satisfying. So why don't I recommend this game?For starters, the brouzouf system is pretty awful. It's like the souls from Demon's/Dark souls - it does everything! Too much, as a matter of fact, for me to care considering how expensive all of the research, personal upgrades, weapon unlocks, etc. are. The starting weapons are a little too good, IMO. Because after grabbing a farming map and unlocking a few of the weapons, things like the TRK (?) sniper rifle are still just completely dominant in terms of accuracy and damage output.Another item is the checkpoint/saving system. One moment, it's saving after certain missions; the next, it's not saving throughout the course of a level I invested about 2 hours in. IT'S RIDICULOUS THAT THIS IS SO INCONSISTENT. Just put in a damn quick save button/manual save option.Side problems, I cranked the brightness way up because during underground levels, I couldn't even see enemies without the EYE vision (more often than not, way too zoomed in to be useful with any scoped weapon).If you are major into grinding and farming games, I guess you'll like EYE. If you want a game with a tight feeling to all of its elements, this definitely isn't for you. It requires a lot of personal motivation to figure out what is going on and enjoy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While I think this is a solid game with a very interesting and bizzare world to explore and learn about, there's one thing that I dislike so much that I'm giving this game a thumbs down, and it's the ""fatal wounds"" system.This system causes you to have a chance to permanently loose stat points upon death or when using high-level abilities without enough energy.  I dislike this because this implies that even if you reach the max level, you can still lose stat points that may be irrecoverable.I dislike the idea that you can't recover these stat points.  There may be a way to recover the points that I'm unaware of but that doesn't stop this concept from being frustrating.  I don't want to loose something as important as stat points permanently.

												It's like a FPS Diablo like but a lot more fun and a lot more original than Hellgate : London which was the first FPS using that approach.There's a strong coherent mood build from graphics, Cyberpunk thematic, story and lore background. It makes the game quite bizarre and fascinating. The writing alternate both very good parts mainly from lore and too many dialogs with a very exaggerate vulgarity. If you can go over the vulgarity problem the writing complete very well the mood and setup a quite fascinating and bizarre game.The action too is very fun and offers many different approaches depending of the RPG elements you choose to develop for your character. For example you can focus on hacking with many stuff to hack including some enemies or even yourself to remove a hack on your character, or you can use stealth a lot or not, or use more sniping, and so on.The shooting is rather great and sometimes quite challenging, the levels are large but also quite non linear. There's also good puzzles and tricks to find that are well merged to the action and to the story evolution. It's not a perfectly polished game but that's a unique great FPS with RPG elements.

												Well ladies and gentlemen, I must admit that I am stumped. I'm not sure how to review indie dev Streum On Studio's latest title, E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy. so instead I will describe the experience I have had while playing it.E.Y.E starts out by asking you to chose gene sequences to define your character's traits. After you have decided on your character's attributes you start out in some sort of dream sequence/trance. After exiting the door in said dream/trance, you are immediately thrust into a combat situation against rival factions, and this is where I admittedly lost track of the plot. That's quite alright though, because at that point I got to experience the wonderful combat system.Combat and inventory management in E.Y.E is a little bit Deus EX, a little bit System Shock. You are limited by what weapons/ammo/items you can fit into your inventory grid. I was able to carry a minigun, dual handguns, and a lovely katana into battle, along with plenty of ammo. The minigun just chews through your foes like nothing else, and at 500 rounds per clip, reloads are few and far between. Successfully dispatching enemies earn you ""Brouzof"" points, I'm still not sure what they do however.Once you get past the initial missions in the game, and start to get your bearings, that is when you start to realize the vast scope of the developer's vision. It may not make a whole lot of sense, however you can still appreciate the intense Matrix on LSD vibe they have going. E.Y.E is a surreal experience that is not for everyone, but if you have a taste for a deep world with plenty of secrets to unravel, this may just be the game you have been looking for.Hacking is an interesting feature in E.Y.E, it works out like a realtime battle whener you have to apply hacks and counterhacks, and stay one step forward of what it is that you are trying to gain access to, because every hackable item in the game, be it a door or a computer, can hack you back. In the case this happens, you are infected with a virus that you have to deal with before you can continue.I have thoroughly enjoyed the time I have spent in the trippy world of E.Y.E, and my only real complaint is that you cannot save anytime/anywhere, instead the game saves your progress at predetermined checkpoints, and also when you enter a main hub. One of the devs assured me that this is so you have to consider your actions carefully, instead of just rushing in guns blazing.			",2217,824,67,269,240,21,271

												The Dualist Pan-Techno Knowledge of the Puppet Master my♥♥♥♥♥ This is basically a collection of multiplayer maps with NPC enemies in them and some really badly scripted missions. Even years after release and numerous patches there are still game breaking bugs. Plus the broken techno French - English makes even the easiest missions into confusing puzzles where you are not sure if the scripting broke or you are just doing it wrong. Also creating servers is a pain so if you are thinking co-op will make it fun, you are out of luck.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not even feeling like wasting time on a bad review, it's a game systems of features implemented with bad UI and crap for story. I bought when it promised 10x more.  It's just all over the place.  The shining parts are just piecemeal bits and pieces.  Don't buy for a reguilar single player gaming experience.  This could have been great if fleshed out properly but it isn't.  Don't buy for story, big emphasis.			",539,170,27,62,56,5,67

												This game, is honestly terrible. Most of the mechanics presented in game (""Hacking"", etc) are INCREDIBLY half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to the point they're pretty useless. In regards to combat, it's pretty ""meh"" and enemies, once they detect you -Which isn't difficult in the slightest- suddenly become omniscient beings who know where you are forever, with perfect accuracy.The inventory system is a major pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to deal with. You have a limited number of slots to put items in, and each item added reduces your overall speed.Also, thanks to the downright AWFUL translation job (The original FF7 had a better translations!) the story is a nonsensicle MESS.Overall, avoid this game like the plague.

												Don't buy it...unless you are curious and see it on sale for $0.90 or something less!!! I recommend you save your money...I paid full price so it's partly why I'm p'ssd.  I didn't bother to check when this game was made and I should have, but it feels like pre-2000.  There is no voice acting all the interaction is all text like pre-2000 so there is a huge amount of reading, something you don't expect for an rpg/shooter type. The environments etc are weird and not entirely clear to where you have to go.  Probably because there is so much crap to read during interactions I can't be bothered to read and so not clear on stuff.  The hacking is muddy to say the least... It's crap in short... Stupid game because there's far too much you have to figure out on your own because of the poor design... avoid it... there are wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy better games out there!  Unless it's on sale for super cheap and you want to satisfy your curiousity ... or it's getting handed out for free somewhere!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Its the biggest total bunch of b0ll0cks if i have ever randomly encountered i'd rather play time rammfu*k made be sergy baws cousin. Seriously that hacking mini-game can fu*k right off to Mars because its flawed as nissian micra with no wheels and no micra. pish. Rather play an unfinished early access tetris game than this communist piece of sh!t. Did dean balls take his inspiration from this when he made G@yZ? Fu*k knows!? Best advise for this game pour some runny gravy into the pc fans holes and watch your computer be clensed from this contagious monstorsty. I can tell this was made in the budget of 2 gyros, programmer was problay stoned out of his t!ts, the rest of the development team, (other than his programming cat) was problay using and abusing crystal meth or some subtance. If i gave a copy of this to kojima he'd problay wouldn't even wipe his @rse with it (no that you would anyway because you would get disc ebola from it anyway.) This game must have proper sneaky beaky past right through quality control or mah boi gabe was on a lunchbreak having himself some fried butter or something like that (perhaps gravy?) The best part of this game was watching the friendly AI rinsing each other around the stronghold my personal favorite part is when i uninstalled it. If you like getting jammed in elevators, getting rinsed by op as f*ck AI that can sniper you from 2 levels away with a rocket launcher and a stupid as sh!t hacking mini_sh!t this game is for you! (but if i see you playing it IL DDOS the sh!t out of your runescape account ya dig?)			",297,20,1,20,13,3,8

												This is a Valve SDK Deus Ex Fan Mod rather than a game. It is very ambitious but suffers from terrible interface and dialogue. I would skip this and play Deus EX: Human Revolution instead. 5/10			",236,129,2,30,12,0,37

												Only on $1 sales.Bought this game very cheap and only cos its screenshots pushed me as a nice game.In fact it isnt that nice, mostly because is a kind of a complicated cybernetical rpg stilished in half life 2 engine.It is very deep in combination of skills and details that are a little hard to get by in the beginning and the TUTORIALS are a huge list of menus to click.Only if you re a fan of the Half Life 2 engine you may like this game.It isnt a terrible game, actually you can notice that it s well polished and seems to have a consistent campaign. But not my style of game. The skills menu were a pain.Got the cards tough, which were added last year.			",277,55,19,45,21,2,46

												Um. If this game is supposed to have partial controller support then why doesn't anything show for it, to set up the controller interface that is, in the Options Menu. Anyone got a suggestion on this one? I'm starting to think that Steam doesn't actually fully check the games out before they are thrown on here for purchase and download. Before anyone says something though, YES, I DID LOOK THROUGH THE REVIEWS, SO FORTH AND SO ON.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game, in a single word, is baffling. I cannot see any reason why a semi-intelligent human being would invest more than an iota of time into what is, quite franky, the worst excuse for a game I have ever played. The gameplay is awful and unintuitive, the character development (and development is a generous word) is disappointing to say the least, and, perhaps most tragically, the graphics (renders) are dogshit. The tutorials couldn't explain to a grown man how to open a tin of beans. This game sucks♥♥♥♥♥ and I give it a well-deserved 2/10.			",152,43,4,22,13,1,28

												DO NOT PURCHASE IF PLANNING ON PLAYING MULTIPLAYER/COOP!!!We purchased this game for the multiplayer aspect, and after spending over an hour trying to configure the settings we couldn't get it to work.  We have followed online guides, and just couldn't work it out.  You have to mess with router settings, port forwarding, console commands, and have your friend connect through the console with your IP address. We both have refunded this game now, it's a shame they never added a multiplayer system where you didn't have to be a skilled IT professional to get working.			",48,5,0,9,1,0,4

												This game is terrible. On the first mission I played there was a marker that said I had to get to an elevator but I checked everywhere and couldnt find it. The enemies are way too hard. The first mission has too many enemies. I cannot figure out how to beat it. The maps are too big and the story is very confusing. Enemies respawn way too frequently. I would not recommend this game to anyone ever.			",96,17,0,3,4,0,1

												Giving this game credit for the few things it tries to do spectacularly ignores the many many many things it does wrong. Sure, small studios doing something different is good, but when they fail this badly at everything, it is infuriating.  It is equally infuriating that I spent money on this game and it proves that Steam seriously needs to raise its standards.This game makes no sense, the writing is abysmal and the animations are rather poorly done. Dopn't flock to this game if you are just a fan of cyberpunk as it is bound to disappoint in other important ways. Not to mention it is broken and very buggy.			",125,34,0,26,28,0,36

												If you like video games that have terrible tutorial systems, bad audio, and not telling you a thing at all about making your character than this is the game for you.  It totally wont hold your hand but it wont teach you anything at all.  The game will even tell you to look up abilities in the tutorial that are not actually listed in it.  I hope you like intros that are just walking through a dank cave with no context and audio that can make you physically ill because that is what you are getting.  This game is absolutely NOT new player friendly and if you expect a game to actually be understandable, you should not play this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
