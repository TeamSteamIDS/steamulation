												Ok, I bought this game for 14 cents and I'm gonna write a serious review and not ""bought the game, sold the cards, earned a cent, profit"".Pros:+Many options, you may change resolution and keys and sounds etc.+Difficulties - you can play it on 3 difficulties.+Reminds a PS1 game (for those who had one)+Keys are comfortable to play+Detailed tutorial+Controller support+Has cards+Combat is pretty good+Community made levels (?)+Many save slots+Cheap (even in full price)Cons:-No story at all-Needs achivements-I said in the 'Pros' that the combat is good, but, you can't stand still, or you die-Enemies do too much damage-Graphics aren't too good and the character's face is scary-No background music-Enemies are pretty the same-Enemies that get hit just turn red again and again until they explode, it's cool for the first minute but then gets boringNeutral:~Dash after level 1 is imbalancedBottom line:Recommended with a score of 6/10			",183,40,9,17,11,2,19

												Despite the dated graphics, this game can be great fun in short bursts.  Playing around with the terrain, running at super-speed up vertical cliffs while machine-gunning energy bolts at mite-like things chasing you, dodging projectiles and then capping it off with a super-high jump that lands you hard enough to deform the ground?  That's a sort of rush that doesn't really appear in a lot of titles, let alone one with system requirements as relaxed as this.  The weapons are pretty unbalanced and you'll only be using one or two once you get them, but that's not really a problem given that competitive balance is a non-issue here.I only wish they'd given you more opportunities and incentive to use the terrain deformation powers to your advantage, in ways that would make you feel that same exhiliration.  It does lack variety and interesting strategy, which is sad.  Community support and quality custom levels and stuff would make this so much more worthwhile, given the core gameplay conceit, but even as it is, it's got a charm to it.  When it's bad, it's dull.  When it's good, it's that kind of game that's fun for the first few days, then you forget about it for a while, and then you pick it up again and relive the magic that hooked you the first time.  It's worth a buy, especially if it goes on sale.			",184,55,0,34,13,3,24

												To be entirely clear, Caster is pretty terrible. It’s also a ton of fun, in large part because it’s only just barely holding it together and doesn’t really give a damn if anything makes sense as long as it’s entertaining.Everything about Caster is more than a little insane and nonsensical. It’s always trying new stuff just because it can, and though this means the whole game feels like a crash course in engine experimentation, somehow it works. It really has no business being as fun as it is, but something about running around as an immensely overpowered MegaMan-reject is so stupid I was barely able to keep it together while playing the game.I have no doubt Caster would be a huge chore if it insisted on imposing any restrictions on you or ever became an actual challenge (though a few moments in the second half begin to weigh the game down), but for the most part it lets you do whatever you want. It doesn’t matter if it unbalances the game or even breaks it in places, you’ve been put into this sandbox to blow stuff up and run really fast and that’s about all I needed.Caster might be barely competent but I can’t help but admire how little it cares or tries to pretend it’s anything but a bit of super dumb fun. I can’t stress enough how stupid everything here is and how delightful I found it. So, sure, I could tear it apart as an ugly piece of garbage, but apparently I was in the mood for something so-bad-it’s-good and Caster more than fit the bill.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												Caster is an average third person shooter that does not contain any notable qualities, aside from the ability to destroy terrain and perform ridiculous map-crossing leaps.Your objective in each level is to either kill every enemy or do a generic fetch quest (there are a few other missions with different objectives but they're uninteresting, for example; shoot a tree). Every level is incredibly short, and even on my first time, each one averaged no longer than a minute. Speaking of game length, the entire thing isn't longer than an hour. The game abruptly ends with a ""To Be Continued..."", and despite being released in 2009, there has been no continuation, and it seems the website does not hint at anything of the sort either.Enemies are all very generic, and each one of their attacks can be easily avoided by just sprinting around or jumping. Even if they do manage to hit you, they deal hardly any damage, and they are easily dispatched; even more so with the weapon upgrades. The story is uninspired, and unless you've never heard or seen the ""It's humans against aliens, you're our only hope!"" plot, then I doubt you'll be interested. As I stated earlier, the game ends at a very unexpected random point with sequel bait. A map editor is available, but I did not use it or download custom maps, so I cannot comment on that.I did not find Caster to be particularly interesting in any way. Terrain destruction and super speed can be fun and worth it if you paid 0.14 cents, but beyond that, there's not much else that the game offers.			",169,16,6,17,8,0,5

												I bought it for $0.14. If I'd know it would have been this good I would have happily paid $5. This game is a fantastic indie gem. It really gives me hope that not ALL the indie games on Steam are awful trash.PROS:+ Terrain deformation is fun and quick but doesn't feel gimmicky or normally required. It frees you up to play with things as you like.+ Running and jumping is smooth and handles well.+ The few enemies the game has are varied and interesting and also deform the terrain.+ Finding the hidden collectables isn't compulsory (it would be very annoying if it was) but makes for a fun extra goal to lengthen the game a little.+ The game doesn't stretch itself longer than it should be. There's not enough content here for 10 hours of gameplay so they didn't make that much.CONS:- The game is short, very short. There's probably more that could be done by adding a few more enemies and a few more levels.- Little problems with all the weapons. Not game ruining, just minor gripes:  > The blaster's crosshairs don't line up perfectly with its ostensibly straight shots. This only becomes apparent at extreme range.  > The eruptor is very hard to aim as it doesn't have a light effect or cast a shadow and just appears as a distortion on the screen. It's very hard to tell where one is in 3D space (how close/far). This also makes enemies that shoot it odd to fight.  > The homing shot has a very hard time hitting enemies. It flies around in circles and ends up slamming into terrain about 75% of the time.  > The shield attack is a neat idea but doesn't have an applicable purpose.- Very few enemies in the game, both in type and actual number. The game would benefit from a little more crowded levels. Some very large levels only have like 6 enemies in them.Final Verdict: Buy this game.If you see it on sale BUY THIS GAME.

												Caster is a third person platformer shooter with slight RPG elements. Basically, this is a mission based game. You select levels and get missions upon entering them. Missions are generally things like, collect all the orbs or kill all the enemies. Although there are more complicated missions, especially later. As you go through the first set of levels, you'll learn the basics, get new weapons, and collect in=game currency. You use the in-game currency to buy upgrades between levels, such as boosting your natural abilities and powering up the weapons you have collected. You can walk around, jump, and shoot for basic controls. However, you can also hit jump again and hold the button to do a super jump, which can help for dodging enemies and clearing distances and obstacles. The other special ability is a dash, which allows you to run quickly. This can help run up slopes and across water. Combining these two special abilities can make for some great techniques. There's also an interesting mechanic of being able to destroy and build up the land with your weapons. This can make tough situations easier depending on what you choose to upgrade and when. There are three sets of levels. The first set are there to help you learn the basics. The second set will make you use your abilities in more interesting ways. The third set will challenge your skills. It's a simple design that has lots of potential. The art is very colorful and pretty, even if I had to run it in minimum settings for my old worn out computer. It still looks really nice, and the music is alright too. It also has a low level of story investment. What I mean by that is... there's only vague story connections from mission to mission, and they don't have much to do with an overall plot. Also, not everyone will be thrilled with the graphical style, as it is dated in terms of modern games. Plus, the level selection method may turn away mordern minded gamers, as well as the simplistic gameplay. The third set of levels are made by the community and aside from the fact that they are very difficult, they're just a bit of a hassle to get. They aren't included with the game download, nor are they available through Steam workshop. To get the third set of levels, you need to go to their site, download the levels, and place them into the correct folder. It's not complicated, but it's a hassle that I'm guessing most won't bother to do, even though it's worth it for more levels. And you'll want more levels because the second set of levels, designed by the developer, is unfinished. There's one mission that, when selected, simply says to be continued. This game, according to the Steam store page, came out in 2009... and it's still not finished. This leads me to believe it's not going to be finished, or if it IS then it's going to have to wait until the developer isn't busy with other projects, which is a shame because this game has lots of potential and I'd sure like to see it through to the actual end to see know what it has been building up to.Still, Caster is tons of fun if you're into platforming third person shooters. It's kind of like a 3D Mega Man if they had done the Mega Man Legends games differently I guess. It has simple rules that create so much potential for cool and interesting levels and missions. While it's not complete yet, it's still worth the 3 dollar asking price. I got it on sale thinking I'd hate it, but it's actually a lot of fun. You could wait for a sale, but it's worth the money anyway. Just make sure you get those extra levels for some more fun. Caster gets a 7/10 for being a very fun third person platformer shooter similar to those a few generations ago.			",222,48,1,22,12,3,19

												It's a quirky and fun, fast paced game where you have to destroy creatures called ""The Flanx"" because they are evil.To defeat these Flanxers, you can sprint really fast, jump super high and can use 6 weapons, all with their own abilities.One weapon, destroys the landscape and one weapon adds land. This makes terraforming a great part of the game.However, it would be wrong in this case, half of the weapons are pure♥♥♥♥♥♥in terms of usability. Even in the levels where you get a new weapon, you can easily use another. I've, for example, never used the Stun weapon and just blasted and destroyed so much land, that I bet I would get Greenpeace or such at my back.The campaign is also really short unless you really want a perfect score but what would that even be?You could be finished with the first campaign in about 30 minutes to an hour. There are 2 campaigns and possible even user-made content.Additionally, half the levels are pretty repetitive.Does this all makes the game bad? No. It's a nice game if you want some quick action and when it's on sale, it's certainly nice to possibly buy. Just don't expect something big however.			",135,21,3,28,19,0,35

												QUALITY ""I AM A GOD!""POSITIVES:-Soundtrack, Length, Variety The gameplay is in hyper drive, but it doesn't feel nauseating or unmanageable.The initial controls are awkward, but the reset is easy. NEGATIVE:-the visuals. It hurts to be taunted with all the high quality concept art in comparison to the highly polished but outdated 3d graphics. This is one of the best examples of a game that was held back by the creator's & the hardware's limitations.But the game is still great regardless. Every little details adds to the epic all powerful thrill.Suggestions: -Update graphics, more character options, and release the soundtrack. oh and btw, this is what a Sonic game should feel like!

 My Review :Rate : 9/10 Game Information :Genre : Indie, RPG, Third Person ShooterEngine : Custom BuiltPlatforms : Windows, MacDeveloper : ElecornRelease Date : 19 Mar, 2009This game is cheap and fun. You can attack enemies in six unique and cool ways with two playable characters. Best part of this game is terrain deformation which allows you to change the structure of environment. I recommend buying it when it's on sale. Pros : ● Trading Cards ● Enjoyable Music ● Useful Tutorials● Simple Story ● Three difficulty levels● Good combat environment ● Terrain deformation ● You can run on water! :pCons : ● No achivements● Face texture needs to be fixed● Very Short ● No Multiplayer● Good controls but sometimes difficult to aim.

												I paid 14 cents for this game so my expectations were extremely low, I figured if I got 10 minutes of gameplay I got my money's worth.What I ended up getting was a delightful Sonic the Hedgehog/Megaman hybrid, in a 3D 3rd person setting that harkens back to the N64 PSX days when 2D platformers were first experimenting with the 3D style, except Caster's mechanics work fine.  You go from level to level, which for most of it is a choice as to which level you take on.  Each level has different objectives, there are about 3-4 different styles each with the occasional story sequence thrown in.  There are plenty of weapons to choose from, my favorite is the seeker, you probably should upgrade that first among the other weapons.  Performance wise I haven't ran into any issues, this game despite being made in 2010 knows I have a 144hz monitor and caps at 144 fps.  Major credit for that.  You would think this game would be great for a controller, but on default settings the camera control on the right stick is all messed up, best to just stick with the keyboard and mouse for this one.In conclusion, for 14 cents it's a no brainer, buy this game.  It's regular price is $3.00 I really don't think that is asking for too much for this game either.  Plus this game supports modding so it's worth it just for that.  I should also mention that the soundtrack is pretty awesome too and is worth the money alone.For the low price, and for what it is, with the inclusion of mod support, I give this game a 4 out of 5.

												If you want to become god and kill everything and jump across maps with the speed of sound. This game has it covered.But let's review the description of the game.- ""Massive terrain deformation!"" - Making the terrain go up or down is not massive.- ""Use strategy to destroy hordes of bugs with a variety of unique behaviors and attacks"" - Not really. Just get and upgrade missiles and stun and everything becomes a joke.- ""Bring trees back to life and collect energy to purchase upgrades"" - Bring trees back to life? How's that a feature.  - ""Upgrade your skills to run on water and jump hundreds of feet into the air"" - Pretty much the fun part of the game, which is the movement since some maps are pretty big. Running on walls could have better controls.- ""Pulse pounding music by Trance Emerson"" - Music is pretty nice but nothing to brag about. How you like your music is your own taste and opinion.- ""3 levels of play (Casual, Normal, and Extreme)"" - Even on extreme its easy if you upgraded your sprint. If nothing can touch you whats going to kill you? If you guessed lava, acid and sorts. You're right. Enemies suck.- ""2 playable characters"" - It's pretty much the same character but with a different gender. They both have the same abilities and whatnot so there's nothing different from one another. It's pretty much if Mass Effect said theres 2 characters but one is male Shepard and female Shepard.- ""6 unique attacks"" - I wouldn't say unique. 3 attacks are lasers which 1 goes foward, the other you can cast multiple and the last its a homing laser. 2 change the terrain and the last one stuns enemies.It's not amazing and the graphics are meh. Don't get me started with the player models and the enemies. Jesus how did that go so wrong. (The fact that the concept art was pretty cool and interesting).Crosshair is a lying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.The camera controls, I really don't know what to say about it. It's just wrong.Apart from messed up lazy models, the messy controls and camera. On and all, I had fun. I think it's a game where you can easily spend 2 hours on it without feeling bored or stressed out. Get it on sale thou. ",179,14,2,4,7,1,9

												keep in mind I paid 20 cents for this. Very simple, rough around the edges, and fun. The weapons: are pretty cool overall. And when you select them you change color like megaman... added bonus. Most weapons are useful, i thought the seeker and the yellow guns could use some fine tuning. but the fact that there are 2 weapons that raise and lower the terrain is very cool. The levels: small, very rough around the edges, looks like one of my first farcry maps. But at the same time the basic design of each level is pretty in its own way. It is easy to get where you want to, whether it be running up a giant vertical wall or jumping 500 feet over it.Game Mechanics / physics: Superfast, it is a reflex based game when it comes down to it. Again REALLY cool to jump super high like matrix / Hulk and land with a shockwave. Once you get the dash and jump leveled up it becomes a bit more fun. Most of the weapons fire satisfactorily. Music and SFX: Good Electronic soundtrack to go along with the fast-paced gameplay, pretty much house music. Sound effects are also good. People have compared it to Sonic and Megaman. I agree, I would also give it a comparison to flower because of the healing trees with your gun fire thing going on not to mention the short levels. Game is not finished... you feel like you are 75% done and it just ends abruptly. Hope they finish it! Maybe add some moves to it, you end up flying through the air a lot at the end of the game with no way to land if you jump to far besides holding the opposite direction which slows you in mid air. Maybe a mario ground pound or dive bomb to give you a swift landing. Could use some more interaction with the environment, vines to swing on, wall jumps, something else to do besides shoot and jump all the time.  ",15,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So, I played this game for roughly 5-6 missions or so and I got a decent bit of feeling for the game. This is what I have to say:~====~Graphics~====~This game is good for what you are into when it comes to gaming though the graphics aren't the best which is fine, but sometimes if someone would want to have the best graphics on because they are used to it or they just want full graphics then this won't be the best for you. The characters are a bit blocky which is also fine, but in ""This day in age"" we aren't used to seeing super blocky characters unless the whole game is made like that. For example, Minecraft is made to be a blocky game so that you can enjoy the building aspect in it to it's fullest extent, though when you play this game you would assume it to be a bit more adjusted to the kind of graphics we see today. The animations are pretty good and the game has a lot of potential in this category but for now I give it this:~Not the Best but hopefully be improved upon~~====~Combat~====~There isn't much to talk about in regards to combat in this game but, the combat in this game could be a bit better and also a bit less repetitive in it's own way. Basically, you spawn into the mission, you're given an objective to do then you do the objective and the mission is done. The objectives aren't all too complicated but they do get repetitive after a while of playing, I know I have only played for 35 minutes or so but that's because I don't feel like going through the same stuff constantly. So I would give the combat this:~It gets Repetitive after a while~~====~Story~====~I am not gonna lie but I didn't pay attention to the story all that much, I started the game and I was given a black screen with text explaining the story. After about a minute or so I realized I had to click the mouse to continue the text scrolling so I kept reading a few more messages. After I read a bit more, I figured that this would just show me millions of text boxes to read so I just skipped through them so I could actually play the game. So, I would give the story this:~Possibly Good if you take the time to read~~====~Final Verdict~====~This game isn't really worth to buy unless you get it on a great sale like I did or you really like these kinds of games. I would check out videos by players about it to get a better feel for the game before you buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The developer spent six more years developing it from release in 2009, and it plays just as ♥♥♥♥ing badly as when it was first released. That's some David Gonterman level of hopelessness going on there.Some people claim that you should buy this game just to make money off of trading cards. I'm willing to bet most of those people are unemployed.			",452,99,7,53,31,2,53

												The premise is clear: the Flanx have invaded Middon, which is short of experienced mages, and you, a noob Caster, gets the job of owning the bad guys.Right away, you’re put in this action shooter game that has a remind of a 3D Megaman. You’ll be dashing, double jumping and collecting  several diferent weapons that will by fired by your arm and many of which can be charged before firing. Among the arsenal you will find from energy blasts and bombs to seeker missiles and a stunner, including some kind of gravitational gun that will deform the terrain increasing its height. If it was not enough, you can actually deform and destroy all the terrain by all your attacks, which also spices the combat mechanics.You will face from cockroaches and flying beetles to giant worms. Each enemy is very different in all aspects starting by the models, and including their weapon and combat approach. You should even be prepared for enemies lurking out from the ground and find yourself running while saying ugly words. What is a bit strange is that, having put the time in differentiating the enemies so much, most, if not all, of them just use the same weapons available to you just colored differently.The game packs 15 short levels and the progress is quite fast. You will start with just an energy gun and the ability to do some small double jumps and dashes and a small health bar. However, in each level you will collect energy by killing Flanx and healing trees, which then you will be able to spend upgrading yourself. There are also some weapons that you will have to find -not that it is hard- to unlock them, and your character will even change color when changing weapon -what does that remind you of, again?-.Caster can be completed in a couple hours, maybe a little longer, although you won’t be able to upgrade everything -and I mean everything, your jumps height, dash duration, health level, weapons power…-, which may take an extra hour replaying some levels. However, if you really want to play more, you can find mods in the game’s website that will give you some extra content. And you will probably want to play some more, since it’s one of those games where you’re just telling yourself after each level ‘Only one more level and then I walk the dog’ and more soon than later there is no one more level.About the soundtrack, I should mention it’s not constant. It packs some tracks that you won’t notice to be there and some others that will really pick your attention because they’re actually good.Overall, Caster is one of these very beautiful indie games that also packs good controls and gameplay and will leave you a taste of wanting more.

												This game is like megaman but in free 3D world.3rd person shooter game when you just run, shoot and dodge while completing the mission.What aspects of the game that makes this game fun?Run and dodge the missile like attack from the enemies lol.Pro :+ Low spec game and low capacity+ Free movement and easy control+ Just shoot them all + Run+ Dodge+ Good for killing timeCons :- Low graphic quality (What did you expect with low spec game dude?)- Makes you bored in long run- Some minor bug with mouse movement when you hold your left-click mouse- There is no solid storyline, just doing some missionsDon't buy with full price, because i think it's not worth with full price, if it gets discount, you can consider to buy it.Be sure to play moderate or extreme difficulty, because the easiest one is way to boring.And I recommended to play it in extreme difficulty and see how could you dodge those incoming missiles lol.8/10 would run and dodge those missiles.

												the gameplay is surprisingly really fun. multitude of different enemies and attacks. you also have a dash that you can upgrade so you can run up walls and over the surface of water (or lava that wont damage you when you are sprinting over the surface. very useful, though if you stop sprinting, then of course you fall in and take a lot of damage.there are additional maps after you beat the first. the first map dosent take very long. luckily there is more, just go back to main menu then load to see the new area available. the game is rather easy, if you play it on hard mode it gets a good bit more challenging, especially on the second map, really fast paced moving and shooting to keep from getting killed. I recomend playing it on hard.			",110,22,1,7,10,0,6

												As I see the only real reason for so many positive reviews is some kind of PS1 (and others from that era) nostalgia. But I still cant understand it. Good PS1 games made 15-20 years ago had much better composed graph and animations, more interesting gameplay, worlds, overall design. In the late '90s this game would be mediocre at best. Two decades later its simply bad.Good games remain good games even after decades. This one is far from catching up with them.			",1593,562,59,156,179,16,251

												I really enjoyed my time with Caster.  This is a 3d combat platformer.  Most importantly the game is just fun.This is a good example of a game that excels without having top end artwork.  The art is decent, and they really like using particle effects.  But, the textures and models are dirt simple.But the GAME.  The game is great.  Controls are tight.  That is super important in an action game.  Your super jumps and dashes FEEL really powerful.  The animations are smooth.  And there are a decent number of options to customize your experience.Play follows through a number of stages.  After each stage, the amount of energy balls you pick up allows you to purchase upgrades for your character, thereby allowing you to specialize your strengths to fit your playstyle.  I also really liked the music, YMMV.  Don't overlook this one.9/10			",36,5,1,4,0,0,8

What's bad:Still unfinished, 6 years after release. Poor visual quality with short fog distance, basically looks like something you'd find on a demo disc for your PS1.  Very basic gameplay, pick up orbs and destroy enemies. The worst gamepad control layout I've ever seen.  (Left and right on your right thumb stick to look up and down, oh and it also fires your weapon, SERIOUSLY?).  Pretty short game, 22 missions, many of them only take a couple minutes to finish.What's good:And yet, its strangely entertaining to play.  There's a good sense of speed when you sprint and super jump around the maps, and the terrain manipulation, while often not needed, is a cool gimmick.  It also controls great with mouse and keys for a third person game.Worth getting?Even if its a bit short you can still get some hours of reasonably entertaining action here.  So yes, there's far worse things you can do with your €3 than getting this game.  I've also seen the game discounted so deep, that putting the trading cards from it on the market basically pays for the game as well.			",172,15,7,38,3,0,44

												THE GAME IS FUN. But I wouldn't recommend it to an average gamer with an average tolerance on games. Here's why.> World is too dull and the designers were obviously lazy.> It has dialogue but no story/plot.> Levels are too easy. > You can easily max out upgrades without even really trying on the game.> Environment gets too ♥♥♥♥ed up when you use the other guns.> I don't mind boxy models but this is too boxy even for an indie game. There are plenty of people who would do you a model of one character with a bit better quality for free.> Mods... I'm expecting custom characters and all but all I get is more lazily designed maps.> Terrible interface and main menu.

												★★★★★★★★ Review Time ★★★★★★★★★★Game yang baru saya beli dan saya mainkan selang beberapa jam ini sepertinya memiliki Good Side dan Bad Side tersendiri bagi saya (+)1. Harga nya cuman 1299 pas saya beli , dan untung nya Drop Card dari game ini jika dijual lagi malah dapat balik modal. Win Win Very Win2. Badge nya tergolong murah. 5 set badge cuman kurang lebih 20.000 pas saya beli3. Musik jadi Best di game ini .4. Lumayan jadi pengenang game game jaman dulu dari PS1, Game cube, dll5. Simple gameplay. Hanya loncat, lari, menghindar, tembak. Itu Doank (-) 1. Komponen di Map nya sangat sedikit. Cuman ada Pohon, air, gunung. -_-2. Grafiknya okelah masih jadul , but lihat lah Muka dari karakter nya, Serem Abissss 3. Tidak adanya fitur Multiplayer, mungkin bakalan rame jika ada MP di game ini. Ya, walau game nya sesederhana ini.4. Nggak cocok dimaenin gamer yang dewasa. Boring abisss.5. Control kamera yang masih rada rada melenceng dari yang kita gerak kan6. Sering Crash sendiri pas Loading60/100 For Me. Lumayan lah mengisi Library karena penjualan drop card nya masih ada nilai tinggi daripada harga game nya			",284,43,11,20,29,1,24

												Extremely repetative and simple score attack shooter. No story or anything to take you along.If oyu like running and bullet hell in 3D this is your game. But I wouldn't recommend if you are looking anything more than hour's worth of gameplay.There isn't much here, specially at the start to keep you interesting and the good, but few in selection, of songs only keep you interested for a while.The weaponry is interesting and allows manipulation of the polygon based environment, but other than that will not offer anything else.Enemies come in 3 variety, Fast, Stationary and Bullet hell. The simple graphics allow you to view some cool effects of the weapon but other than that, doesn't offer anything to look at, bland textures, boring level design. Having low production value doens't mean it is bad, it is just way blander than it should be.There was extreme amount of potential at show.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While Caster can be fun some of the time, there's really no other value there. If all you want to do is spam overpowered weapons while sprinting around at mach speed, this is probably the game for you. But if you like your games with actual value in them, actual story, playability, difficulty, challenge or what have you, then look elsewhere, because Caster lacks all of those and then some. The graphics are very outdated and the textures/models can be glitchy as they clip a good amount, but even if they don't they're still not pleasant to look at. The character isn't even aesthetically pleasing and that's the one thing you have to stare at the entire game. Not to mention his/her face is just down-right creepy at some angles. The balancing is dreadful, as you get a game-breaking weapon at about level two, and the difficulty spikes up and down more than a heart monitor. Also, once you max out your health and sprint ability (which can be done very early game, mind you), you can just sprint back and forth to avoid every projectile, while spamming you're broken weapon that shoots as fast as you can click (and if you're like me, that means it can be spammed at speeds that will melt bosses in no time). So there's no balancing and the graphics are bad, what else? Well, the story is worse than both of those cons combined. The easiest way to describe the story is by saying that there just isn't one. You're a new recruit and you're sent on missions to combat what seems to be an evil creature-empire that's expanding and trying to take over the world(?). You go place to place and just clear each level, there's no more objectives than that. Also, there's only like two themes of levels, and they're repeated over and over. Later game you run into a few levels that are almost impossible given the game's engine, where you have to keep a small ship out of the water even though it goes way faster than you can terraform the ground in front of it, and a boss battle that just drags on so long no matter how much damage you deal per second, and you just have to spam and dodge for like five minutes straight. The game is also very short. And last but not least, the developer decided to incorporate a destructible environment... everywhere. Weapons that deal a little bit of area damage will also chip away at the ground on every level, so if you max out your weapon and you're spamming like hell (as is the custom) the ground will basically meltdown out from under where you're aiming. It breaks the map and it breaks the game, even though it was already broken from all the other previously mentioned problems. When it's all said and done, I would not recommend the Caster to- well, anybody. The only reason it's not getting a 1/10 is because sprinting back and forth at mach speed while spamming your blaster like you have some sort of turrets is actually quite enjoyable in a weird way. So because I ran into a little bit of fun there, I give Caster a generous 3/10. That being said, do not buy this no matter what, not only because you'll waste money, but mostly because you'll just waste your time. I got it on sale for pocket change and I feel like I still got ripped off.3.4/10			",653,290,30,72,70,8,107

												Fast paced action game with destructable terrain, although few modes (Kill all enemies, collect energy orbs or uninfect a tree). The graphics are very good for a 3D indie game. I had experienced a few bugs on one of the levels although it was very minor. The fighting style makes for a nice change compared to the current standards, and it is always nice to see such a good game with low resource usage.			",137,31,6,11,14,4,11

												Once you go Blast, you never go back.As in you only need like, one power to basically sweep all the enemies in this game. However, I do enjoy playing this game, even if there isn't any real story. But its practically this (I'm assuming):In this world these insect beings known as the Flanx have been destroying the environment, as well as people. Humanity rises up to this challenge by calling for the help of people known as Casters. Casters, having vast amount of magical energies can run fast, kill Flanx with lasers, and restore trees to their natural beauty. Now its up to one caster to defeat the Flanx and restore the land.That's the ""story"", imagine Megaman and Sonic like someone else said in the review section :)7/10			",33,5,0,11,3,2,2

												Caster is a fast paced 3rd person shooting game that has a lot of interesting ideas that don't really pan out properly. They give you multiple interesting weapons to use but you only need one to beat the game and two to make it even easier. There's also a nifty upgrade system that maxes out too quickly and leaves you feeling way too overpowered very early on in the game. That being said I still had fun with the game though it is disappointingly short and the story doesn't make much sense since there's a lot left out of context. I bought this game for $0.14 and am happy with what I got but if I had even paid the regular $2.99 amount I probably would have been much more upset with this game and wouldn't have been able to enjoy it as easily. The developer seems to still care for this game and I hope that with some constructive criticism and their continuing to approach this game in a creative way it can get better over time and I can recommend it for the full price that they want.

												READ NOWThe thing is:This game hasn't actually been abandoned as some people say it has, the creator (Elecorn) has been working on and off on a massive update for a while now and he's probably going to comeback with a big bang on this game at some point, thats why its starting to get a bunch of PROMOTION SALES in the past 18 months or so. Anyway, My review:I'll start with the bad things about this game:- When i first played through the game, it left me a bit downhearted because i enjoyed it, but then this message pops up saying it hasn't been finished yet and to check a website for updates, WTF (this was at that moment anyway) i mean this game was released quite a while ago (Release: 2009) and it hasnt been finished past two chapters? (Disapointment filled my heart)- The Gameplay: Extensive in terms of moving around the environment, however extremely limited to what powers you use, The enemies constantly appear and are very repetetive to fight against, and it feels really wasteful as to understanding what it is you are supposed to do, makes a game feel rather pointless, especially if it isn't visually amazing either.- And I feel that this game could beso much better with a certain amount of... satisfaction in terms of succeeding, this could have been introduced by introducing achievements or special in-game rewards that add to the exxperience, but this isn't such a big deal.THE GEWD STUPH:- Potential! Potential! Potential! : I dont give a s hit if this game was made over five years ago, knowing the future may probably hold a great deal of gameplay is good enough for me, like i said, it hasn't been abandoned and there is hope for this game.- As awkward as the graphics were, it was also very creative, this game is certainly a unique and creative piece of unfinished work, the terrain is potenitally extensive and could be editted a fair bit more, but the concept is very exciting.- As limited as your options are in terms of fighting styles, there is no denial in the fact that it is extremely accreting in the sense that it makes you feel superior to the world you are being introduced to, this goes along the lines of games like Forced Unleashed and Prototype as a listed ""Badass simulator"", it just feels awkward because the developer hasn't 100% succeeded at creating it yet, I certainly hope he will finish it.Stylisticly (even when finished) this game isn't going to be appealling to a fair few people. BUT if you think about how much this game may or may not evolve from here, you could be finding your ideal game that will extend your feel for the indi-game genre, and besides, there isn't really anything to waste, i mean, the amount of sales on this vary between      10-50 cents, i mean come on, thats cheap af.Realistically (for all the Stiffs out there) Rating: 5/10, buy anyways, its cheap.Optimistically (For sick-dawgs to support there fellow gamer/dev) Rating: 8.5/10, BUY NOW, because the opportunity in this could go from what it is to a great stylistic game introducing a new genre of gaming as well as bringing out thing like possibly multiplayer or even more stylistic traits. ;) ",80,6,0,9,9,0,2

Don't play with a controller unless you enjoy insanity. Keyboard controls are so much easier and work quite well.The game doesnt make sense and its all a bit of a mash up graphics wise. There is something there though that once youve been playing it a while (desperately hoping that the last trading card gets added to your inventory so you can stop playing) becomes quite fun.Maybe if this game was released 25 years ago itd be awesome but it wasnt - its poo!

EPIC! i got it on sale, the last level is missing, and i played the whole thing in almost one go xD it's a really fun game, short and action packed, it was a little challenging on the extreme difficulty, didn't try the normal and easy mode but i think they must be easy			",329,87,6,40,22,5,32

												Caster is reminiscent of the playstations Megaman Legends. While it may be lacking in graphic detail the gamesplay certainly makes up for it, fast-paced action and various abilities to chose from and upgrade. Missions are simple and easily completed. I had quite a bit of fun just messing with the ability to change the hieght of the ground, fun game.			",209,19,0,28,11,1,21

												Hi dear developers! I am not gonna lie, I bought this game becuase it was the first 3D game on Steam when ordered by price (and I am drunk as ♥♥♥♥ writing this review too). I  enjoyed this game more and played it more than I though I would. I think it is like Dark Souls if you start on Expert and don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on.

This is 5, my Friendsa Good and interesting (!!) game that  does not give a lot of reasons to think about kindness and  almost does not carry the significance,  moreover, any bad creatures try to destroy the light of the world (do not know to what, but it's always a bad thing ), moreover, clearly they want  capture that world and to parasite here.

Its seems a bit quiet alot of the time!Add in an endless modeAdd in a boss rush (all of the bosses in a row)Add in more characters (steam workshop?)(this one seems a bit small but it would make the game cooler) Add particles in when charging arm cannon and dashingReally good game for anyone who wants a good time!

												I only bought this game because at the time it was 9p or something. So played it to get the trading cards. Its so strange and cheap and weirdly fun!? Don't play with a controller unless you enjoy insanity. Keyboard controls are so much easier and work quite well.The game doesnt make sense and its all a bit of a mash up graphics wise. There is something there though that once youve been playing it a while (desperately hoping that the last trading card gets added to your inventory so you can stop playing) becomes quite fun.Maybe if this game was released 25 years ago itd be awesome but it wasnt - its poo!

												I do not understand the negativity surrounding this game. I bought it for 16 cents and sold the trading cards for 18 cents. This alone should give reason to buy it. However, there is so much more. The game is amazing. Sure, the graphics are terrible, and sure, there's no story. But the gameplay is stellar. By the time you've fully upgraded every power, you feel like a god among mortals. Heck, you only have to upgrade dash and jump to enjoy the game. You can easily earn more money than you spent on this game, but even at full price it's a steal.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let's say something honest about this game.This game makes me sad. Not because it is mediocre (just mediocre though, not utterly shameful), but because it tries and fails.Caster has a few features which got me entertained for some time despite the poor overall quality of the game. The character movements are well-done and it's pleasant to jump n' run around with actually quite much fluidity. The entire terrain deformation feature also made me have a bunch of fun at it's well-included in the level design (I'd even say this is pretty much the only thing that keeps the lev-des acceptable along with the variety of the environnements).BUT.The first thing which will strike you is the graphics. Jesus. I know it's Elecorn's first game, but the game came out in 2009 and I felt like I was playing an early PS2 game. The textures are low-res (giving by the way to your character the face of an eternal suffering) and the models are quite polygonal.While I'm at it with the general graphics, the particle and pyrotechnic effects are horrendous. When you cast an attack, you really don't have a feel of empowerment because they just look so weak and unimpressive. Some fire and explosions would be welcome in order to take these pew-pews to the next level. Even the attacks from your ennemies are looking unthreatening, while they in fact at medium defficulty deal a good bunch of punch. This seems like a detail, but that will make the boredom come at you in an even shorter time.Now 'bout the the gameplay. Like I said, there are a few interesting things which brings some spice to your adventure. But the gameplay is seriously too repetitive. There are tens of levels and the objective is always the same. Either kill all the ennemies, pick up some energy balls or make a dead tree come back to life. And it's a shame, because this game has potential. There could've been much more things to do, especially with the pleasant movement system and the different attacks to gather along the game.Oh, yes, the attacks. There's a total of six attacks which are, like I said, pretty unimpressive, but fun to use for a little time. You have a basic pulse laser attack, a charged blast attack which deals great damage to both the ennemies and the environnement, an ability to raise the level of the ground, seeking missiles, stunning lasers and a (quite useless) shield.Not only they look pitiful, but their upgrade system is too classical and bulky, and you just gather these attacks by approaching spheres which are spread in the in-game world. You don't acquire them by defeating bosses or gathering an out-of-the-ordinary object, nah. You just encounter 'dem spheres and yoohoo, magical attack learning. That is and will remain too simplistic and it totally does not give any feeling of accomplishment.I could bash this game for a longer time, but this is just sad to look at. There's been effort and you can feel it. And I don't want to be too harsh on somthing that's been the output of many hours of work. So I just hope Elecorn will learn from its failures of the past and make us a neat Caster 2 in the future. Because they really seem to have good ideas, and good ideas leads to potential.C'mon. You can do it, guys.			",92,12,2,5,9,0,11

												Fun concept, decent enough execution. Wish there was a bit more replay value on the individual stages, but aside from that they are well crafted and fun to roam around. It doesn't seem like you earn anything special for achieving all the objectives, and sometimes the orbs are hard to find. Not a point of frustration though, just an unnecessary annoyance.

												Absolutely sensational quality content. The integrity displayed overwhelmed me with three main points; the divinely hand crafted atmosphere most games lack, the unassailible and limitless ways to share your victories with others, and the enticing graphics to draw you straight into the action.Without doubt, the setting portrayed throughout the stages perfectly inveigled me into the story like no other have I experienced. The peachy skies and flawless earls encrusting the curiosity held in deep under the covers. I would suggest one to visit the profile of yours truly, to absorb the scenery in the screenshot photography I specialise in.Many a time, I would be left alone in other games, a lonely tension in the air. Fear not, for caster consumatley fulfills this hunger for companionship one so desires. To quote Nicholas Sparks:  “She was struck by the simple truth that sometimes the most ordinary things could be made extraordinary, simply by doing them with the right people...”  I would highly encourage this lively experience for anyone sociable or not.In most cases with mainstream games, one would be marketed to a particular audience, focusing on one factor such as story, gameplay, or graphics, etc. Caster? nop. Caster is a game that is truly extraordinarily well blended, like a single malt Glenmorangie fitted in a round bottomed dummy, dohdoh, or binky (Pacifier for the uneducated). The immense effort put into the adrenaline pumping, delicately balanced partition in the clouds that this piece of artistic genius presents can only be summarised by a quote from Barry himself:  ""Every day should have its golden moments, it's the diamond standard"".

												Well, i have beaten the game on medium difficult and i seriously didn't have that much fun, the game has an interesting concept but that's about it. This is more like a prototype, a ""test"" from the developers and it does have some interesting mechanics. Music was great, loved it. Graphics not so much, it is too much ""meh"", they look like some sort of graphic that a ps1 game would have, which not necesseraly makes it bad, but there is simply nothing unique about it, it doesn't catch your attention, it has absolutly no proper style. And the gameplay, oh the gameplay, so much mixed feelings about it... First of all, it is quite fun to search for all the weapons, but after you got all of them (about halfway through) it absolutely doesn't make you want to continue. As you upgrade your gear you start becoming OP, very early in game i maxed my normal gun and a few moments later my dash and my jump, it wasn't very hard to do this and yet, i became a monster. Max Dash+Max jump = saints row 4 flying mechanic. Max laser gun = Continuos beam of death. What irritates the most is that the developers though they could fix this by making the enemies even more OP. Bosses are bullet sponge, flying mosquitos are almost impossible to kill and do WAY too much damage. Plus, minus 1 point for that freaking Toxic cloud. After all, it was a short game, a interesting concept, a very nice music and that's about it. Worth 2 dollars? I don't think so, you probably will just keep in your steam library and never play.Want to buy this game on sale so you can sell the cards and ""win"" money? Good luck, i have beaten both campaings and won a single card. ",290,54,6,34,20,1,20

Played a bit and found the game average at best. But for 14 cents I say give it a shot. You aren't losing much if you end up hating it			",186,43,2,16,9,3,14

												Now let me tell you, this game is fun. It's fun for all the wrong reasons however. Upgrade your jump all the way in the first few levels and you can just ignore the rest of the game. What's that kill the enemy? nah, I'll just jump him and the next few continents. This game made a mistake by giving me a weapon that allows me to lower and raise the ground. What was supposed to be a cool canyon maze quickly became the envy of all salt flats. A level in which there were lakes of lava, no worries, raised all the ground now it's a resort. Oh? The enemies die in water then allow me to get rid of all that silly land.Tl:drJump higher then you ever have before and play god.			",90,28,0,17,12,1,3

												This game is pretty awesome, it might seem like just a third person shooter but for some enemys you have to find their weak spot. For example, in one of the later levels there are a bunch of little flies everywhere so you have to use your stun weapon in order to stop them, then you have to use your homing missles to take them out. This is really fun and for $0.14 it's an amazing deal.			",260,60,5,21,33,4,36

												I want to like this game. For the $.20 I paid for it, I wasn't disappointed. But for what this game COULD be I am extremely let down. It feels like a half-finished project, especially when you get to what is currently the last level and it says ""to be continued, check the website for news."" This game was released 6 years ago and there's about 2 hours worth of play currently. This game is due for a major update or at least a well-rounded sequel, complete with an actual story-line, explanations as to what the hell you're doing and why, and some variation to gameplay other than ""hold down mouse button, run fast, collect orbs.""This game looks ♥♥♥♥ing neat. It looks like it should be amazing. I REALLY want to like this game. But I can't honestly say I'm thrilled with it. For it's cheap price, it's totaly worth it. And for that alone I'm reccomending it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Going into this I wasn't expecting much.  The preview video and the screenshots revealed little about its gameplay, and the art style didn't look like much, either.  But boy was I pleasantly surprised!  The spells you cast are really fun to use and each have their place against certain enemies, the movement is so satisfying and fun (dashing at the speed of sound and leaping across the entire map, anyone?) and the enemies, at this stage in the game, are easy but varied.  My only gripe is that the game hands you too many upgrade points at once.  I'm not even an hour in and I've already maxed three abilities (jump, dash and Pulse) and it's making the maps trivial at best.  Maybe this was the intention?  All in all, a great purchase (on sale for $0.14 USD) and I also think it's a good purchase at its full price as well.  Definitely worth your time.  Also, community maps!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got Caster for something like 20 cents. The game is similar to a PS1/N64 game and has that kind of quality to it. I grew up with these so I knew what to expect. The game looks ugly, but it reminds me of those PS1 games making me like it a little. There are different powers to try out and they're all fun, the game is challenging and makes you use all of your skills. I enjoyed it because there was no right way to beat an enemy. You can run rings around them looking for an opening or leap into the air and rain death from above. Don't expect anything amazing but for the price it's worth it, you can just have fun with it. Also if you had a PS1 or N64 it has a really cool nostolgia factor towards it. 6/10			",75,4,3,7,2,2,1

What is it with this game being crazy!? The enemys are completely different from what ive seen in any game, the use of weapons on enemys and the way they (Sometimes) blend into or go with the environment.Overall rating: 8.3/10:This game is Totally out of my comfort zone inside gaming, and im SO glad i pushed the boundries.

												I bought this during the sale with some spare Steam Wallet cash, and I mean, this isn't the best game I've seen, but I mean, it's not a terrible game. I like the way the game controls for the most part. I liked the dashing and double jumping. The shooting was easy, and the weapons were at least varied enough to actually all be interesting to see what they did. I mean, I probably won't play this game to its end, but I mean, it has some good parts, and some bad. The levels felt open and barren, but each one was at least somewhat unique for as far as I played. The graphics could use a bit of work in my opinion, but I mean, I think for the sale price, I'm not really going to complain too much.I only really recommend this with the sale price, I mean, 3 bucks for this wouldn't be too bad in my opinion, but I mean, I probably wouldn't have picked it up myself at this price.

												A great game for it's price. Still learning the game, yet it seems like the power scale of the weapons is a wide range, to the fact where, unless I need a specific weapon is needed for an area, I always use it (SPOILER: orbit, it shields from attacks fires fast, and can be held down to make many different things). Not sure about later in the game though. The tutorial and the pop-up texts explain almost everything you need to know. It's a bit dark in parts of the game, and hit detection on a few of the enemies are off, but aside from that and me getting lost in some of the bigger maps, I have no complaints. I've seen other complaints about the game not being finished, but it seems pretty much done to me, aside from a few bug patches.			",90,33,0,10,13,0,6

												It's quite an interesting game actually. 1st off, i love the game mechanics, that is what makes this game really fun and enjoyable to play. I really didn't expect it would be fun when i bought it but hey, it is, however, although this game has fun game mechanics, the level design and graphics are awful. It looks like the developers just spent 1 hour creating each level. That makes this game seem so cheap. I want to reccommend to the developer that if they created some amazing levels, i would consider this quite an amazing game. Take the map of Skyrim for example, or titanfall. The map/s in those games are detailed and amazing. Something similar in this game would have made it even better. I would have also preferred voice acting. So in conclusion, it has fun game mechanics but horrible level design and graphics. They could have upped the texture res a good bit at least.			",136,24,5,11,17,2,7

												So then.Caster.I guess the only way to describe this is with a story.Imagine you are sitting at a bar. There you are with your group of friends, sitting, drinking, eating, normal bar activities. You glance over the shoulder of your friend and see a very ugly woman sitting at the back of the bar. You point her out to your friends and she notices, blushing harshly under the glare of you and your group.Everyone stands up and laughs at her because she is so horrifically hideous, however she then stands up and laughs with everyone.It turns out she is actually a really fun person, you look past her ugly exterior and you slowly fall in love with her. But after a while you realise she is only fun in one or two situations, all of the other times you dont even know what to say to her, or what to do.You leave her, she cries for a few days but she gets over it.Turns out you only gave her 9p.Worth it.

												I think this is my first indie game on Steam I liked (though I am new to them). Caster is a well-designed game with very tight controls and unique enemies that can change the way you play levels for a very fun experience. The story isn't the most well put-together and neither is the main character, but it serves well enough to get the game rolling. I think the levels are built very uniquely and not only cater to Caster's abilities and need for space when fighting enemies but also show how large and empty the world that Caster lives in. And while the Middon levels were fun, I think the ones in Lydonia were the more superiorly designed levels, though I hope the creator ends up making that last level, because that was a bit of a harsh slap to the face after having played so many engaging levels. This is definitely a game I recommend you don't pass up.			",184,74,0,14,4,0,2

												Well, it was on sale for 17 cents. I expected absolutely nothing and got a bit more than that. All in all, it's a pretty good game... It's strikingly evocative of a sort of slightly-crappy but still ""Cult classic"" PS1 game, from the visuals to the early-2000s-esque techno music in the background- Which might turn some off, but honestly, it's exactly the sort of game I feel I would have rented at the video store growing up.The gameplay's fairly simple and straightforward: Run around at high speed, shoot at enemies, rinse and repeat. The first weapon you get shoots rather slow-moving lasers- Brings back memories of the golden days of fast movement speed tied with non-hitscan weaponry, at least for me. As you progress through the levels, you pick up more abilities for your suit, as well as upgrade the abilities you already have, eventually ending up basically flying around the map at the speed of sound spamming homing missiles that kill everything on the screen pretty much automatically. The game has one of those really early terrain deformation systems, where you can raise or lower points on the map to your heart's content (After acquiring the weapons that let you do so, of course), which is cool I guess? It kept me engaged for the two and a half hours the main story lasted.Onto the story: To put it mildly, there isn't one. Really, there's three characters: You, a mute anime-ish-looking boy/girl in a suit of what can only be described as power armor; a two-dimensional portrait of a lady that gives you instructions at the start of each level and congratulates you at the end of such; and the commander, who you never even see and who only shows up through text at the beginning and end of the main story. The story itself is that there are a bunch of bug-things and you have to shoot them. It's really not that deep. It also happens to stop halfway through and suggest that you should wait until some sort of update.The graphics are like a Nintendo 64 game, and not a good one. Enough said.All in all, it's not what I'd call a great game, but if it's on sale, go ahead and pick it up. Put it this way: It's cheaper and much more fun than going to Wal-mart and getting a gumball from one of the machines.			",119,23,4,9,9,0,11

												I want to like this game. For the $.20 I paid for it, I wasn't disappointed. But for what this game COULD be I am extremely let down. It feels like a half-finished project, especially when you get to what is currently the last level and it says ""to be continued, check the website for news."" This game was released 6 years ago and there's about 2 hours worth of play currently. This game is due for a major update or at least a well-rounded sequel, complete with an actual story-line, explanations as to what the hell you're doing and why, and some variation to gameplay other than ""hold down mouse button, run fast, collect orbs.""This game looks ♥♥♥♥ing neat. It looks like it should be amazing. I REALLY want to like this game. But I can't honestly say I'm thrilled with it. For it's cheap price, it's totaly worth it.

Unless it's on sale, don't buy it. This game released it 2009 but 6 years later there are no updates. The mods are easily completed and it doesn't give you points to upgrade.Think of this game like Sonic + Megaman ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I think this is my first indie game on Steam I liked (though I am new to them). Caster is a well-designed game with very tight controls and unique enemies that can change the way you play levels for a very fun experience. The story isn't the most well put-together and neither is the main character, but it serves well enough to get the game rolling. I think the levels are built very uniquely and not only cater to Caster's abilities and need for space when fighting enemies but also show how large and empty the world that Caster lives in. And while the Middon levels were fun, I think the ones in Lydonia were the more superiorly designed levels, though I hope the creator ends up making that last level, because that was a bit of a harsh slap to the face after having played so many engaging levels. This is definitely a game I recommend you don't pass up.			",184,74,0,14,4,0,2

												Now let me tell you, this game is fun. It's fun for all the wrong reasons however. Upgrade your jump all the way in the first few levels and you can just ignore the rest of the game. What's that kill the enemy? nah, I'll just jump him and the next few continents. This game made a mistake by giving me a weapon that allows me to lower and raise the ground. What was supposed to be a cool canyon maze quickly became the envy of all salt flats. A level in which there were lakes of lava, no worries, raised all the ground now it's a resort. Oh? The enemies die in water then allow me to get rid of all that silly land.Tl:drJump higher then you ever have before and play god.			",90,28,0,17,12,1,3

												Caster was able to provide just less than one full hour of entertainment--just about as much as one would expect. It's short, but that hour is more enjoyable than most of the other dime-shelf games on sale. Considering the low price, and of course the trading cards that'll likely offset it, you might as well give it a go.			",73,17,0,7,8,1,3

												I got Caster for something like 20 cents. The game is similar to a PS1/N64 game and has that kind of quality to it. I grew up with these so I knew what to expect. The game looks ugly, but it reminds me of those PS1 games making me like it a little. There are different powers to try out and they're all fun, the game is challenging and makes you use all of your skills. I enjoyed it because there was no right way to beat an enemy. You can run rings around them looking for an opening or leap into the air and rain death from above. Don't expect anything amazing but for the price it's worth it, you can just have fun with it. Also if you had a PS1 or N64 it has a really cool nostolgia factor towards it. 6/10			",75,4,3,7,2,2,1

What is it with this game being crazy!? The enemys are completely different from what ive seen in any game, the use of weapons on enemys and the way they (Sometimes) blend into or go with the environment.Overall rating: 8.3/10:This game is Totally out of my comfort zone inside gaming, and im SO glad i pushed the boundries. I got this game on sale, but for me, full price is a ♥♥♥♥ing steal.

												Caster is a 2009 game that would have been a big hit on the Nintendo 64. I'm talking about the good old Rareware quality before Microsoft turned it into just plain Rare. In spirit the developer should earn a Miyamoto award! I think the developer was a senior programmer at Hidden Path Entertainment, they are known for games like CS:GO and Defense Grid 2.Instead of writing a long review (which I may semi-do anyways ;P) I'd like to show some gameplay footage. From this hopefully you can deduce things like how quickly you can pass Caster and level of fun.


YouTube™ Video: Caster -  Various Play 

			Views: 48		

			I play four maps. No particular reason for selection. There are a few maps with some interesting features and slight variations to spice things up.		

The game directory contents is quite interesting. It uses SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) and some other familiar DLL files. The assets are open to look at. For example the levels consist of two image maps. One for depth and one colour coded that represents the actual design. Essentially you could just create a level in Photoshop or Paint.The biggest problem with Caster is that it freezes my PC randomly. It may have something to do with the graphics since the game works fine in safe mode. The only thing you can do is press the reset button on your PC when it happens since Ctrl + Alt + Del won't even work.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game could have given so much more. To give you an idea, I beat this game in 89 minutes, that's with exploring, and completing EVERY little objective this game has. As soon as I beat it I never touched it again. Here are some pros and cons...Pros:-The game is fun, and gives you a break from hardcore games.-I've never really seen any other game like it, it's fresh.-Easy to pick up, easy to play.-Fun abilities, and once yo finish the level you don't have to leave. There was a couple of times where I kinda dicked around a lot, but it was fun.Cons:-The levels/worlds are not very expansive, it can take anyone not even 2 minutes to walk from one side to the other.-The games levels also kind of seem unfinished, they made landscaping where they wanted you to go. Only one level was actually good, it was kind of a swampy level.-Small variety in enemies.Over all, this game was a bit rushed, or it was someones first project, I have no clue. If you have an hour or two to waste, buy this game, it's only $0.49. ",101,25,0,24,5,0,2

												I have never played a more holy game than this. It is the best game since lego harry potter to use a function where you have to switch out the weapons manually while the Flanx attack you. What I liked most personally has to be the reset of the game after you apply options. Other than that, I customize my characters left and right varrying from male to female. I have died a dozens times trying to figure out how to defeat Flanx, but then I noticed that they clearly explained how to beat them.

If you want graphics, you're at the wrong game and you should probably check another one, but if you wish a decent game with some really interesting gameplay mechanics that can offer a lot of fun, don't hesitate to get Caster and help out the dev, since he deserves some love as well!

												Basically this game is a engine demo for a Mega Man Legends inspired game. It doesn't have tank controls though. You have 8 abilities and the ability to dash super jump. Jumping 500 feet into the air is super satisfied. You can upgrade all weapons, health, dashing, and jumping though points earned during the level. So you're Super Jumps become flying. The story is nearly non existant. You are Caster (seemingly a spell caster) who gets spells to destroy monsters and revive trees from evil flanks (creatures). The character looks inspired by Megaman. Theres a missions system where in the level you get the power up for certain creatures is similiar to megaman. The only other character in the game is a blonde who tells you a basic mission and says good job when you do it (Like Roll). IT IS A UNFINISHED GAME! But every level introduces new mechanics. The floor is destructable which can lead to some strategy on some level. The levels are basic, but have a general mechanic they are built around. Later missions I actually died. You are getting swarmed by flying enemies and little ground swarmers, and the chaos gets pretty fun. Seems like this game was made by a few people in thier free time. It's a shame nothing more came out of it because with money and polish if feels like it could have been a series. First 3 levels are meh. Then it gets more interesting. It is bland, but what is there is interesting and endearing. It's just sad because more resources could have turned a good tech demo into a great game. It's definitely worth a peek if on sale, you are a diehard megaman fan, and can appreciate the simple things. I shouldn't like this game as much as I do, but it grows on you. Which seems to be the general sentiment in reviews.			",203,27,8,12,20,2,14

												Clearly an unfinished game (and should probably be advertised as ""Early Access""), but even in its raw state ""Caster"" is a lot of fun.  It's basically a third-person shooter with extreme low-gravity jump effects and a bumpin' techno soundtrack.  Not a game for graphics snobs (it looks like something from the Playstation One), but I did get a giddy rush as I leapt two hundred yards in the air and let loose with a barrage of heat-seeking energy balls upon the ant-aliens firing their pathetic purple lasers at me below. Sometimes it's all about the simple pleasures...I played through it in about four hours on the normal difficulty setting a few months ago. Enjoyed it so much that I'm coming back to it on the ""Extreme"" difficulty setting now, and finding it tough enough going that it feels almost like a new game.For what it's worth, the dev says in the forums that he's (she's?) got more content for this game in the works, which might be ready for early beta testing soon.  I'll definitely be buying it when it comes out.			",139,124,0,13,5,1,8

												I've finished what appears to be the first chapter of the game and I totally enjoyed it. The game is worth the money even at full price. It reminds me a lot of Dragon Ball since the gameplay mechanics are similar. If you want graphics, you're at the wrong game and you should probably check another one, but if you wish a decent game with some really interesting gameplay mechanics that can offer a lot of fun, don't hesitate to get Caster and help out the dev, since he deserves some love as well!

												I have never played a more holy game than this. It is the best game since lego harry potter to use a function where you have to switch out the weapons manually while the Flanx attack you. What I liked most personally has to be the reset of the game after you apply options. Other than that, I customize my characters left and right varrying from male to female. I have died a dozens times trying to figure out how to defeat Flanx, but then I noticed that they clearly explained how to beat them. I now look forward to the many days where I shall replay it over and over. It was pretty smart. 10/10			",9,1,0,0,4,0,0

												A mildly interesting shooter reminiscent of the PS1/N64 era shooters but a bit smoother. The music is killer and the sense of movement is really fast and satisfying. It's a shame, then, that it's all marred by uninteresting design all across the board. There's barely any story, the graphics are poor, the levels are emptier than my bank account and there's barely any sound effects.The music is pretty cool though but even then there's not enough tracks to keep me satisfied. You're looking to buy this game either because 1- you've played every other 3rd person shooter out there... EVER, and you want to play Caster as your last resort or 2- you're interested in the indie scene and think the game looks cool. For both camps, I say you can definitely do better than this game.So unless you get some chance to get this game free in a bundle or gift, go for it but I don't think it's worth the money spent at current price.

Caster isn't a deep game. Caster isn't really a pretty game. But Caster IS a fun game.The meat of Caster is using your energy powers to blast giant bugs to hell. You have 6 powers you can unlock (With additional abilities for running, jumping and shield regen):  Pulse (Basic projectiles) Orbit (Defensive orbs form a shield that is also used as a weak attack) Seeker (Guided missles that go for all available targets) Stun (Does exactly what the name implies) Blast (Modifies the terrain by blasting it down) Eruptor (Modifies the terrain by blasting it up)Though Eruptor and Blast could have easily been a single power, and Orbit is basically useless, the powers are all fun to play around with. Especially when fully upgraded, which is done simply by purchasing them in the menu by using points obtained after completing each level. You can get more points by killing all enemies on the map, finding all the large power orbs, picking up all the small power orbs dropped by both enemies and trees aftter ""healing"" them (shooting them with your powers). The levels themselves are fairly large and sparse, perfect for the breakneck pace you'll be running and jumping after upgrading your basic abilities.The bugs, your enemies, have a few interesting designs. But by a few I mean a few since there is little actual enemy variety in this game. You have swarmers, shooters and grabbers. Bosses are more or less bigger, badder versions of the basic enemies.Graphically the game is no better than an early PS2 title, which just adds to the charm. That said the article effects look pretty damn good. The only thing I can say looks outright bad or ugly are the character portraits which look like they're right out of someones DeviantArt account from 10 years ago.Music is enjoyable, no annoying tracks to be found but nothing too memorable either.tl;dr if you want a fun little arcade-y game where you're super OP and go ham on hordes of enemies then play this game ",230,27,1,26,22,0,46

												This game could have given so much more. To give you an idea, I beat this game in 89 minutes, that's with exploring, and completing EVERY little objective this game has. As soon as I beat it I never touched it again. Here are some pros and cons...Pros:-The game is fun, and gives you a break from hardcore games.-I've never really seen any other game like it, it's fresh.-Easy to pick up, easy to play.-Fun abilities, and once yo finish the level you don't have to leave. There was a couple of times where I kinda dicked around a lot, but it was fun.Cons:-The levels/worlds are not very expansive, it can take anyone not even 2 minutes to walk from one side to the other.-The games levels also kind of seem unfinished, they made landscaping where they wanted you to go. Only one level was actually good, it was kind of a swampy level.-Small variety in enemies.Over all, this game was a bit rushed, or it was someones first project, I have no clue. If you have an hour or two to waste, buy this game, it's only $0.49. ",101,25,0,24,5,0,2

												While I liked what I've actually played of this game, I honestly cannot recommend it even for the 3EUR, or whatever it is in your country, right now.For one thing, the game looks like, well, s**t. And I'm no graphics w****, but this game just looks... really, really bad. Mind you, I don't really care, but if graphics are something you care in any way about, this game isn't for you.Of course, other problems include level design, which tends to be completely generic and uninspired at its best, and just s***e at it's worst. One level is just a bunch of squares arranged in rows, like so________|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |Well. That's the closest thing I can get with ASCII art, anyway. Others can be a bit more interesting, with mountains and stuff, but the game's level design is nothing special.Of course, the real problem with this game is how hilariously unbalanced it is. It's not long before you can throw around mighty balls of energy that deform the landscape at will, are capable of jumping hundreds of feet in the air, running around faster than Sonic on steroids, etc. etc.And while some of this is alleviated with the fact that some enemies have huge amounts of health or are capable of one of your mighty super-move-esque blasts, it's not nearly enough.To be honest, something I felt the game could have really benefited from is some multiplayer, because that could genuinely be interesting, with groups running and jumping all over the place, deforming the landscape at will and attempting to hit each other, but alas, it was not to be.So there you go. That's my opinions, based on what I've played. Might've missed some things that somehow magically fix all this, but the game lost me before that if that's the case.			",42,5,0,8,0,1,3

This makes it a very nice purchase for anyone who wants an action-y game on a netbook or other low power computers (do use an external mouse, though).And no, you can't run it on a Raspberry Pi 2 with Windows 10.

												Oooooh my. This was a interesting one. So here is my list.Great buffs1.A really good combat system.2.Destruction into the world basically you can put holes in the ground on that mission aka the level.3.Really cool Ideas for the weapons I have to say to myself.4.Amazing enemies and level Ideas.Spoiler5. Upgrading system was a pretty thing to add in the game.Debuffs!1. Character models look wierd as hell.2.Not like a long story I could possibly beat this game less in 2 hours heck 1.3.They just had area block off like a big wall not like a certain area sealed off.Not much for the debuffs.One thing I was ok with!The game was really slow in the start but becomes really fast paced later on.

												Even though recieved at a 75% reduction in sales price, well worth the full $2. As I see other reviews giving it a hard time for it's outdated graphics and negative comments, I wonder why there are people hating on a developer such as this who took time to create a small indie-sized yet enjoyable sandbox-like, bullet-hell masterpiece but the same ones give AAA games that lack nearly any creativity the ""10"" rating that it doesn't deserve. If you are like myself who can play a games and can overlook small flaws to design in areas like grahpics and clunkiness from time-to-time, then I'm sure you will find the price is well worth this Electronic-soundtracked indie dark horse.

												Never have I been so excited to run and shoot things in my life.For those who want the short and simple review, Caster is fun. Alot of fun. Get it.For those who like to read:Caster is an overall great game, but it has its ups and downs. The colorful array of powers and the interesting #D terrain makes for a great experience. I especially enjoy the fact that I was able to play with a controller, as it requires a little more skill. What KILLS me about this game is the general lack on contect. I was able to complete the game within in an hour on its normal dificulty. Graphics wise there is alot to be desired, but that's just me being picky. All in all I give it a 7/10, definitely worth playing considering its price.			",40,4,0,2,2,0,1

												i'M CURIOUS AS TO WHY THIS HAS so much ""positive"" feedback. OK, the gameplay is solid, the guns are cool, the enemies are varies, if simple.... but it's an unfinished storyline.

												Price / hour 0,58€ (there's some sales to get it cheaper)First off why it's a masterpiece in it's own way: It's unique and featured in ""250 Indie Games You Must Play""Before I move to Pros and cons, I say this: If you like the trailer (ignore the music), buy it. It's not like the new game trailers that doesn't have anything to do with the gameplay, this Steam trailer fits the whole gameplay pretty well. People who like fast and different movement in gaming like me, this is absolutely a good choice for it.Pros:- Soundtrack. It's not like in trailer, it's peaceful with little power in it, so heck it's awesome and enertaining.- The speed. As I said about the different and fast movement, it's true.- Destroyable enviroment -  The weapons destroy (or add) some ground and you can use it to example avoid attacks.Cons:- Length- Bonus maps by mods. Mod pack 1 took like 20 mins to complete, there's no much fanbase to this game and therefore no more maps, doesn't affect so much to the interest of this game.- Unbalanced weapons. Seriously I used almost only one weapon to complete the game because it was simply the best when upgrading to best- Super jump is too.. superior. You can kinda just fly through the map and kill the enemies above. It's not what Caster is about as you can see from the trailer. ---> I like the upgrades and stuff, but it makes stuff way too easy. If this game would be longer though, this issue could be removed, because you can't get half of the upgrades at the first levels.- Ignore the partial controller support - at least when my Gamecube controller was attached to my computer, it somehow bugged that it forced the mouse to go upwards 24/7			",164,33,6,18,5,0,2

												Disclaimer: I've been playing offline, that's why it says I've only played 0.2 hours. In reality it's closer to 1.2 hours.The game has 2 chapters, and at the time of writing, I'm about halfway through the second one.The main complaint I have about this game is that it's just way too easy. I played on Extreme difficulty and I could still get through most of the levels without even taking damage. The Dash move, which is unlocked at the start is basically just a sprint which makes you run at about 3 times the speed of sound. After each level you can buy upgrades which cost about half as much as a ♥♥♥♥ing Twix, and after upgrading the Dash a few times you can dash for about 30 seconds with a 3 second cooldown afterwards.While dashing, you can walk on water, toxin and lava don't hurt you and you move too fast for enemy projectiles to be able to hit you. The only times you even need to bother with killing enemies are the levels where the objective is to clear out the area. When the objective is just to heal the tree at the end, or to collect all of the energy orbs, you can just sprint past the Flanx (enemies) and finish the level in about 30 seconds.For attacks, the only one you need is the Pulse, which is basically a rocketlauncer that you can charge to do more damage, but just spamming the uncharged attack is enough to kill most enemies in no time once you've upgraded the attack a few times. Even the big♥♥♥♥♥bosses are a piece of cake once you know how to spam the attack.The controls are good, and I like how your attacks can affect the level (shooting rockets makes craters appear etc.), and the monster design is pretty good and creative as well.That said, the difficulty is really a dealbreaker and therefore I can't say I recommend Caster.4/10			",183,23,7,17,23,2,8

												I played a bit of Caster and I didn't find it particularly interesting. I don't care about the graphics, which doesn't look good, but the game is simply not fun to play. You have 6 different weapons (that you collect as you progress) with which you can kill/stun your enemies, but the enemy variety is little, and basically it's always a question of running around the enemies to avoid being hit and shoot them until they die. Levels are really small, and with the instructions + map it's very easy to finish them.Sound effects are basic, and there's no story to get involved with. A plus of the game is the options' menu, very rich, but all in all I simply wouldn't recommend playing the game. Pick it up only if it's heavily discounted.One final thing: on Mac, this game crashed once while I was playing, and once it failed to launch.			",97,60,0,9,5,1,8

												8/10 - Sonic with a gunThis game is really fun. I was suprised to be honest. The movement theme is similar to sonic, but you also have a gun to kill enemies. Different upgrades, boosts, enemies and bosses makes this game pretty addictive quick. Easy to pick up controls and the game is pretty rewarding so far. Worth the full retail price of $3!

A grafikája finoman fogalmazva szar, de nem ezért rossz, sőt még ki is lehetne bírni. Egyszerűen annyira monoton ez a játék, mint a Terminátor új része.

												This game was okay. It was pretty fun for the first 20 minutes or so, after upgrading the jump and dash things. Running around was really fun,  but it got old pretty fast. I idled for the cards, and I'll probably never touch this game again.			",36,9,0,3,3,1,3

												Man... I thought this game was soooooo cool back when I was a kid because I could run super fast, jump 50 ft into the air and level or raise the freaking ground. Now that I am playing it now, this game is terrible. The controls are all whack, you move too fast to even aim, I don't even know the story. Perhaps I am illiterate but You shouldn't get the game, unless you enjoy jumping high and running fast for a couple of minutes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a  game.Interface/Menu/SettingsYou are able to change the Music volume everytime by 10%.You are able to change the Sound volume everytime by 10%.All resolution sizes are available.You can toggle between fullscreen or windowed mode.There is a camera sensitivity.You are able to change the controls on the keyboard.You are able to change the controls on the controller.You are able to play the game with a controller. Obviously.There is ""How to play"".There is a difficulty level available.There are many save slots available.About the game.You are playing with some kind of thing and you are send into a mission. You have to complete objectives to move on to the next level. Mostly killing enemies or collecting orbs. The game is getting dull very quickly as it has nothing to offer. You are basically doing the same stuff over and over and over again. You got a shop to upgrade things and a mini-radar at the bottom.You can choose between male or female character.However the scenery in this game is very bland, and i mean VERY VERY BLAND/EMPTY.The animations are very dull.The game Graphics are from N64. The music is the best part of this game.Enemies are easy and not very interesting. I am playing this on the highest difficulty and there isnt a big issue to deal with.Other things.It would be better to only get this game during a sale or discount, otherwise you are better off playing a different game. Don't expect too much form this game.-------------------I Give this game a 3/10			",467,171,6,45,49,1,62

												It's repetitive, generic, short & unpolished even for a one man indie game. The most creative idea in Caster (reforming terrain with weapons) is only used functionally in 2 levels in the main storyline in 2 short puzzles. The shooting gameplay involves very little thought, you'll find yourself spamming the attack button with the reticle pointed in the general direction of the enemies alot while running in circles or backwards to avoid getting hit. Enemy AI is extremely predictable, they literally do the same thing every time without variation, e.g. everytime you shoot a certain type of bug, it will jump into the air & land until you shoot it again, another type of enemy walks back a specific number of units every time it gets hit.If you can sell the cards you get & essentially get the game for free, then you might as well try it, but I doubt you will enjoy it. Most 5th/early 6th gen store attack shooters are better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Caster is a really fun, action-packed shooter game. You're able to run super fast, and also jump very, VERY high, which makes the game quite interesting. You get throughout the game 6 different powers (different attacks) which you'll be able to use in the later maps. These 2 combined together makes a quite nice punch, as you'll be able to jump quite high and run fast to dodge the enemy attacks and at the same time shoot the enemies (this made the game quite easy for me tho). This reminded me very much of Megaman -series, since the character also looked alot like Megaman.The game took about 1,5 hours for me to play through. ",224,34,5,17,16,3,7

												Caster is probably not for all people and its not for me either. In caster you play as a rookie caster who is asked to fight off a deadly waves of aliens called flanx. It gives you diffrent powers to fight them which is cool because some of those powers are pretty cool. The worlds you visit look awfull and look dull its just fields of nothing. The flanx types look awfull and sometimes just a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to fight them off. With infinite lives you cant die so that helps to fight some of the tougher enemies. But some missions are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥such as Acid meadows. In that missions you have to escort a boat by lifting up the ground through the acid lake and the boat can be destroyed. Overall this game is just awfull in all ways horrible graphics, bland worlds, terrible gunplay and awfull enemies its just a title you need to stay away from so if you want to buy it be warned i give this game a 2/10			",905,350,32,94,59,7,85

												Ehh, I wonder why there's so many positive reviews.This game is just another example of hello-buy-me-sell-cards.The idea of gameplay is hello i'm mage on drugs and i hate ants and stuff. The release date that steam shows is a year of 2009. Well maybe in a year of .. erh.. 200x where's x stands for something under 4 or so.. that could be a good game. But no, it's no fun, it looks old and even gameplay, sorry, is bad.2 free flash games of 10.			",230,40,7,40,39,1,42

I snagged this little gem for only 14 cents with a 95% Steam week-long sale.It's a lot of fun, is very fast paced and the controls are tight and responsive.You got levels to beat, lot of baddies to shoot down, towering cliffs to double jump on, and pools of water to jump into from far above to create an epic splash effect!  Super Fun!The options for both graphics, screen resolution, and sound are nice in an inexpensive game like this as well, plus it offers over 10 different game saves.At the regular prices of $2.99 USD, this game is a good deal... but at the 14 cent sale I bought it at, this is a no brainer.  ..If you play it 10 minutes, you've gotten you money's worth, lol.  Thumbs up all day, every day.  Pure win.			",438,131,5,67,63,1,41

												Drawing inspiration from such blockbusters as Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing and Jurassic Park: Trespasser, elecorn presents to you his magnum opus, Caster. In Caster, you follow the legend of a young boy (or a feminine frame boy), his face tragically crippled at birth by low poly counts, fighting against an unknown alien threat known as FLANX, determined to sit there and do nothing or walk at innocent humans in straight lines as they go about their day. To defeat such a menacing threat our hero is granted the power of super speed and must fly through rin- I mean collect orbs of power, granting him powers such as running up vertical walls, jumping so high he crosses the entire level, and homing missiles that _very_ accurately track their enemies.The game also features a myriad of references to previous grand slam titles often overlooked by the casual gamer. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics are a reference to Final Fantasy 7, one of elecom's favorite games when he was 5. The physics reference legendary racer Big Rigs, with the ability to instantly stop while running 172839127 mph. And of course, who could forget the large number of bullets and badly drawn characters, clearly a reference to ZUN and Touhou.Caster's main strength is in its simplicity and accessibility. With levels lasting between 3 seconds and 2 minutes, you don't have to worry about a commitment when you sit down; you can simply play! The controls are very intuitive; some may critcize the heavy mouse acceleration, but it's by design so that all players, newbies and pros alike, have equal trouble aiming and controlling their character ensuring a balanced experience no matter who's playing.However, no matter the level of quality of a game there are always a few negative points, and Caster is no exception... one of them being that there are some issues with the PC port of this game. In the optimization process from Linux to Windows and Mac, a large amount of autism was left in. I for one cannot stand for excess autism in my games, and so I cannot ignore this sloppy port job, no matter the quality of the actual game. Further, in his rush to get the game out for the holidays (a goal which he ultimately failed at, thanks to Steam wrongfully delaying his game in their rigorous review process), elecom unfortunately left the game unfinished. Not in the traditional way though, where devs don't have time to add their layer of polish, but actually unfinished. When you attempt to enter the final level you are given a ""To Be Continued"" screen. What's there is golden, but what COULD have been there could have been so much more...  It's a real shame elecom didn't get to finish his title, as it would have been a good nominee for game of the year.In the end Caster will be put on the long list of visionary video games tragically cut short by time and budget constraints, dreams brought down by the crushing reality of checkbooks and deadlines. Do yourself a favor and pick up elecom's game. For only 99 cents, you can't really go wrong. You don't need supersize fries anyway. I give this game a 7/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I will list this game pros and consPros    - got it on sale, sold the cards the game gave me, made a profetCons   - the graphics are not so great. The face of your charecter is REALLY WIERD!   - out off all the cool abilitys you may ever get in this game you only need one and use one   - upgrading those abillitys is so one sided since you only ever need and use one   - mainley the game was just tooo easy. you cant really lose even if you dont try playingIn the end the only time you should buy this game is when it is on sale for 25 cents. play for a little and get 4 game cards. sell these cards for 7 cents a piece and make 3 cents. Otherwise NEVER GET THIS GAME			",24,2,0,3,2,1,11

												I bought this game because it looked like it had some potential. However, this is clearly someones first game as it is basically the engines default graphics and such. You have a poorly made character with poorly made animations. The controls on the controller are misconfigured, so you have to essentially use the keyboard. The game consists of you running around collecting orbs that are scattered over the world. I'm sure there are enemies and such later on, but, there's nothing unique about the game. I'm sorry to have to write such a poor review of the game, but it's really really terrible. It's so bad, that in the intro level, you collect an orb that says, hey, there's some extra graphical settings we included, but didn't program into the settings, so you have to manually edit the .ini file if you want them. And another that states, if the controller isn't working right, you need to manually change it around.I can't stress enough how boring this game is. I would highly recommend against buying it, even if it is just 50 cents on sale. Go buy a candy bar, you'll enjoy it more.To the devs: do a better job. If you're a programmer making a game, hire some artists and designers. If you're an artist trying to learn to program, hire a programmer. If you're a 12 year old and this is your first game, then you're on the right track, but don't try and sell your 1st, 2nd, or 50th game until it's actually worth playing. If you're a team of artists and developers, then shame on you for producing this horrendous abomination trying to make a quick buck.			",660,124,8,73,44,7,65

You get 6 different weapons with their own physics and abilities that are pretty neat.Some cool mechanics with how you can use different to change the landscape.I'd say it's worth the price especially when it's on sale.

												As far as value for money goes, this game is pretty good. It doesn't hold any real replay value, and the game itself is very short, but it just doesn't care about itself enough to be anything but silly fun.Pros:+ Movement is very smooth+ Music is very good for an original indie game.+ The attacks are varied and require at least a tiny bit of strategy to complete, even if the game is easy+ Levels aren't too binding and rarely serve to frustrate or go on longer than they should+ Lots of options to play around with, including controlbinds and difficulty levels+Optional objectives in every level for completionist types+ Doesn't last any longer than it should, and ends before the fun wears out+ Boss levels are pretty satisfying to beat+Trading cards! Cons-Graphics are pretty bad, but forgivable as it feels strangely retro.-The game is very, very short. All in all you could get about 4 hours of enjoyment out of this game before it becomes stale-The story is plretty much nonexistent. -No character development whatsoever-No achievements-Enemies aren't too well varied-Minor gripes with weapons, their hit registration is sometimes off-Dash makes the game extremely easy-Running up walls and other surfaces essentially cancel out environmental hazards. -Some levels are hilariously easyFinal verdict: 6.5/10Definitely worth a go for 14 cents.If you're looking for a bit of silly fun or something new you won't be disappointed . Just don't expect too much, it is an indie game after all. ",42,2,0,4,4,1,1

												I can't tell you why, but I really enjoy this game. Easily one of my favorite games ever made. There are many many problems, I know,  but for some reason this game just speaks to me. The fighting and the movement are the things that grab me the most, I love the double jump and how far you can fly with it. I deffinetly recommend this game.			",279,55,3,26,33,2,19

												Meh 3rd-person Megaman wannabe, except there are better 3rd-person Megaman games out there.Ugly artwork: Anime-esque, but cheap and shoddy.Ugly graphics: Worst shading I've seen. Textures appear to be drawn crudely, then stretched over a few polygons.Even at 14-30 cents this game isn't worth the buy.

												So, after having played Caster for a good while...What do I think of it?On my first time, I started and stopped the game due to controller issues, but it was likely a problem on my end. I'm unsure if it's accostumed to XInput or DirectInput... Anyway, the controls are pretty simple and fluid, since it's the basic move-shoot-jump combo with a Dash button. You have an upgrade system, in which you can up your shield (Lifebar), your pickup distance, Super Jump, Dash (which becomes really handy as you go on), along with the six weapons. The graphics are reminiscent of the early PS2 era, meaning that if your computer is the equivalent of a toaster you shouldn't have any problems running it. You have three difficulties - Casual, Normal, and Hardcore - that are all functional in their own way. You have a good bunch of levels, though the objectives are straightforward. The gameplay in itself feels like a cross between Megaman Legends and a Bullet Hell, when you have loads of enemies. The music has a touch of electronica, neither ill-advised nor well-suited, but it gets the job done. The story's pretty simple, as you're a completely new Caster trying to go up against an alien race known as Flanx. As usual, it's all up to you as you traverse through the game. As you power up your weapons, you're going to have to play a little bit differently as each weapon intensifies its use - as an example, Blast blows small craters on its first upgrade, developing into giant holes as you further upgrade. The scenery, as advertised, shifts along with the battles you have in the level, in a level of terraforming I haven't seen in any game of yet - reminding me a bit of the Dragon Ball Z series, in a way. It's not exactly a time-sinker, as it is Single-Player, but it's always good for a round or two if you're a little bit bored. It does have mods, but you need to go to the game's site to get them. At the time of this review, there's only one modpack - that assumes you have everything upgraded, as it ups the challenge. Perhaps if this game had enough of a fanbase, it might qualify for a Steam Workshop...?tl;dr - Forgettable if you let it slide back into your games library not to touch it, but your first playthroughs are decisively fun and entertaining, and likely enough to keep you entertained.4/5 - Gameplay3/5 - Sound3/5 - GraphicsFINAL SCORE:3/5 - Reasonable!

												I VERY much enjoyed playing through this game, very fast moving combat with upbeat music. The only thing i can complain about would be the ubrupt end. This was rather dissapointing, asking me to check the website for updates, but the game hasnt been updated in 5 years, they JUST added steam badges and cards, not really something I care about. I only hope that this recent update will mean they are back to developing the game!  For 14 cents got well more then my money's worth			",66,4,0,5,5,0,7

												So, after having played Caster for a good while...What do I think of it?On my first time, I started and stopped the game due to controller issues, but it was likely a problem on my end. I'm unsure if it's accostumed to XInput or DirectInput... Anyway, the controls are pretty simple and fluid, since it's the basic move-shoot-jump combo with a Dash button. You have an upgrade system, in which you can up your shield (Lifebar), your pickup distance, Super Jump, Dash (which becomes really handy as you go on), along with the six weapons. The graphics are reminiscent of the early PS2 era, meaning that if your computer is the equivalent of a toaster you shouldn't have any problems running it. You have three difficulties - Casual, Normal, and Hardcore - that are all functional in their own way. You have a good bunch of levels, though the objectives are straightforward. The gameplay in itself feels like a cross between Megaman Legends and a Bullet Hell, when you have loads of enemies. The music has a touch of electronica, neither ill-advised nor well-suited, but it gets the job done. The story's pretty simple, as you're a completely new Caster trying to go up against an alien race known as Flanx. As usual, it's all up to you as you traverse through the game. As you power up your weapons, you're going to have to play a little bit differently as each weapon intensifies its use - as an example, Blast blows small craters on its first upgrade, developing into giant holes as you further upgrade. The scenery, as advertised, shifts along with the battles you have in the level, in a level of terraforming I haven't seen in any game of yet - reminding me a bit of the Dragon Ball Z series, in a way. It's not exactly a time-sinker, as it is Single-Player, but it's always good for a round or two if you're a little bit bored. It does have mods, but you need to go to the game's site to get them. At the time of this review, there's only one modpack - that assumes you have everything upgraded, as it ups the challenge. Perhaps if this game had enough of a fanbase, it might qualify for a Steam Workshop...?tl;dr - Forgettable if you let it slide back into your games library not to touch it, but your first playthroughs are decisively fun and entertaining, and likely enough to keep you entertained.4/5 - Gameplay3/5 - Sound3/5 - GraphicsFINAL SCORE:3/5 - Reasonable!

												This game was boring right off the bat, but it seemed to be getting more interesting so I kept playing.  I finished the entire first campaign.  It actually managed to get worse.Nothing in this game is done well.  The combat requires no skill, just persistance.  Instead of actually ramping up difficulty, the designer just made a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of bullet sponges.  The various attacks and upgrade system are horribly imbalanced, with some things being almost completely useless.  For example, the stun ability has an incredibly short effect time.  The levels are horribly designed.   There was one level where the mission briefing told me to elmininate all the enemies while climbing what was essentially a huge spiral staircase around a tower.  It then allowed me to just run up the side of the tower, ignoring every enemy, and complete the mission by reaching the top.  Of course, I'm sure I don't need to tell you that it looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥too.  After all, you have eyes.I really cannot see how anyone would have terrible enough taste to reccomend this.  It's slow, easy, tedious, unoriginal, and ugly.It's trash.			",214,76,5,32,24,1,23

												Out of boredom I used the last coins in my wallet to buy this game, at first I was thinking it would be a terrible mistake, ironically, this game has potential, and got me playing it for 2 hours 'till I found it's end.The spells at their first levels aren't that interesting, but after farming those trees for a bit and unlocking more powerful levels, I found out that it's incredibly fun to blow several enemies with that acid blast spell while jumping several feet high and creating a massive hole on the ground at the same time. I think the development should continue, and maybe in the future this game can earn a sequel, or a revamp in these graphics, because it's really worth it. So to sum it up, I love this precious mini-game, but I'd love to see the full version of it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Caster ReviewPro Tips:1) Upgrade dash and jump first!2) In the first level, hit all the trees and kill all the enemies! You should have a total of 6895 orbs!Caster is a good game for only 1.99. It’s definitely nothing great but you can definitely get some fun out of it. If your new to PC gaming and your not fully adjusted to keyboard controls this game is definitely a good place to start. This is an indie game so I don’t expect much from this game, but the graphics are nothing to cry home about. I understand the person was trying to go for a PS1 type look but it needs refinement. Also a story though not necessary would have helped this game out a bit. My final score is as follows.Final GradeB			",370,46,0,27,5,0,11

												A tech demo.  Bad graphics.  Good EDM music.  Repetitive gameplay: collect this, kill that.  You get different weapon power-ups.  Deformative terrain.  Upgrade system for weapons, health, speed, and jump.  15-20 stages; completes in about 2.5 hours.  Each stage is at least unique.  3 Environments: grass, snow, lava.  Last level is a ""to be continued"" but the game seems to have been abandoned/dropped/given up.Do not recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Caster is an addicting little game, I felt so powerful playing it, like a superhero, like Astro Boy. I would have loved to play more of it, the game was too short but I heard that more episodes will be released in the future, for free(only if you buy the game, of course). Until then I can enjoy a few mods that I found on Caster's website. I definitely recommend it.			",1506,598,36,178,114,14,197

												This game was on sale for $0.14 so I bought this game for cards but when I started playing it, I just couldn't stop ! Despite the poor graphics, this game is incredibly fun :D The environments keeps getting interesting as you progress, the terrain being affected during combat, the electronic background music and other stuff perfectly bind together the game. The gameplay is easy and quite smooth, killing bug-like things running at you, exiciting terrains, vaious attacks and upgrades and several other factors will add hours to your gameplay :)On the flip side, it has some cons too. It lacks some strategy and variety. The game is very short and the levels got only a few enemies, and it also seems that the developers spent more time on the environments rather than the characters. Overall, this game is awesome ! Worth a buy, especially if it goes on sale. I would rate this game 8.5/10 :)			",280,67,9,21,24,6,31

I also used to throw all my garbage out the window and it would hit my neighbor's car... But again, through the power of Christ, and this game.. My life has been changed... Buy this game, it was a life-changing game, that brought hope to my soul... 11/10, I would buy it thirty more times... To make it the price of a Triple A game... Please, I'm not an automated robot made to write this heart-fulfilling review, but a real boy who used to be made of wood (Like Pinocchio)... I love this game so much... *Starts Crying* That I would make it my son... If it were my son... I would love him like this game... Thank you all for your time... Read this review with the urge to buy this game, I believe it will change you as well.. Goodbye everybody.. I've got to go... Got to leave you all behind.. And face truth... Mama.. OOOOOOOO...

Dated and UnengagingCaster feels, in every way, like a game I might've rented for Nintendo 64 back in the day and completely forgotten about by the time the weekend came to an end.Clocking in at about an hour, the game is incredibly brief and simplistic--loosely guided by a storyline so insufficient it's difficult to understand what is actually going on, you dash across barren landscapes for a couple of minutes to fulfil what is usually one of two objectives: kill all flanks on the map or collect all energy balls on the map.The energy balls act as a currency enabling you to upgrade your shield, dash and jump abilities, as well as your arsenal of six weapons, which along with the rudimentary environmental deformation adds a little variety to the game. Regardless, I solely used the Blast weapon throughout the first campaign because none of the others ever offered any advantage. The second, shorter campaign simultaneously makes Caster more interesting and frustrating, posing more thoughtful objectives and stronger enemies yet forcing you to use useless weapons such as the Seeker, whose supposedly ""seeking"" missiles hit their target about 10% of the time.Frankly, this game wouldn't have made it past the bargain bin back on the Nintendo 64, and thus it's embarassing to see such an incredibly amateurish product released in 2009, indie or not, at the laughable price of 4.99. The fact that the second campaign still leaves you with a ""to be continued"" message, five years on, is telling of the fact that Caster has likely been abandoned, and rightly so.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												  Megan Man-esque with the ability to alter terrain. I was shocked in just how interesting this game would become. I wasn't expecting much, but it became interesting. The thing is, the premise and the concept...it could have been SO MUCH more. Not that this is bad, I just think the creator could have taken this and made something amazing. But this is what we have. Beautiful in its simplicity. It's definitley unique, and I hope the creator went on to big things. It's still a great game, especially for the price I paid: (17 cents). But for full price ($3.00 USD) I would still say it's worth it. In terms of value: I paid .17 cents. A scale from 1-10. Ten. For the full price, I say its around a 7.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In this Dragonball inspired game, you play as a 'rookie caster' who is the only one left to restore the world and defend against the infestation known as the Flanx. This game will have you dashing about at high speeds blasting enemies and altering terrain with several different abilities. Launching this game the player's eyes will be assaulted with a fuzzy polygonal mess and a crudely conceived UI design. The nicest piece of art this game has to offer is the Steam thumbnail. Having bad production value doesn't mean a game isn't fun but unfortunately Caster has very little to offer in terms of gameplay. Caster is a third-person shooter with a camera angle that can very from directly behind the player-character to a top down perspective.  It can be fun to zip around the map and lay waste to enemies but the player won't experience this until at least one hour into the game. Caster requires the player to collect energy in order to upgrade abilities and as a result the first hour or so of gameplay is very slow and tedious. After this first hour there will be a brief moment of mild amusement and then the player is immediately introduced to enemies and situations that require a slower playstyle. In my opinion the developers would have done well to skip the whole upgrade process that made the first hour or so of gameplay a waste of time and focus on high speed gameplay that this game advertises. Just shy of two hours, my gameplay experience was ended by getting killed because my character was held motionless for a cutscene. This happened to me two consecutive times. This game supports USB controller gameplay however the controls seemed pretty bad (and maybe unworkable). I played with the keyboard and mouse. Score: 2/10			",509,60,3,44,29,0,78

Product received for free
												I got this for free and I still feel cheated.• The visuals. Textures look like they've been pulled from the 90s. Maps are big, floating rectangles with some hills here and there, surrounded by invisible walls. Trees were probably added ten minutes before the deadline. UI, well, exists, and that's the best I can tell about it.• The mechanics. Camera movement is a joke. Above you it doesn't show anything useful, and behind you it distorts the distance between you and your goal. Enemies can jump bazillion metres in the air and you cannot aim at them. But they can still hit you. You can upgrade your skills for credits, but the game doesn't tell you how will it affect them. For example, first upgrade for ""dashing"" (basically sprint) made it last 10 seconds instead of 1.• And the other stuff. Dashing makes you glued to the terrain like trucks in Big Rigs. That means you can climb terrain even at 90 degrees. Tutorial tells you, as an ADVANCED tip, that there are graphics options unavailable from settings menu and YOU HAVE TO MANUALLY EDIT CONFIG to access them. Pathetic.Overall: 1/10. I feel like I've put more effort into this review than devs into the game. Disgusting.			",137,49,3,11,13,1,8

												Nevermind the graphics, try the Caster demo on the game's website to see how it plays.  Caster isn't perfect, but it's a decent 3D arena shooter with a variety of shot types and a feeling of power.  A second episode was added and there might be more to come.  In the meantime, players can add their own missions.http://www.elecorn.com/caster3d/ ",809,175,6,67,43,6,106

												[ENG] Seriously is this a game? At the price of 3 Euros? LOL. I just bought this game for 30 cents with a random coupon, i'm playing it just for trading cards...

												Psychedelic masterpiece owing a debt to the Serious Sam school of fast-paced game design. Solid colors rammed through the bleariest of lighting filters. Megaman running and gunning on the transforming terrain of ExciteTruck, a 3D shooter spiritually in tune with by-gone arcade shooters. Flashbacks of Ratchet and Clank: Going Commando and the Jak and Daxter games but with a DIY cell-shaded anime aesthetic. On max settings, it is all bold tones smeared in radioactive light. Tune in, turn on, and be taken in the soft parade of energy orbs.			",584,102,6,57,33,5,49

												Gameplay is somewhat ok, other than that its bad. Its like playing megaman on 3D with the same graphic as megaman X from the 90s. The control is badn, its way too hard to aim unless you have a perfect sensitivity, which is hard since the sensitivity option is very limited. Once you finish about 2 levels, it  gets repetitive and boring mostly because there is no story. And don't forget the characters' faces, they look like PS1 charachters.			",16,2,0,0,2,0,1

												Fun, but incomplete.The game is fun, it is a little indy game with retro like graphics. it is less fast paced than it look like in the trailer, but the feeling of speed and liberty is great. Pros: -speed depend on the player, go all gun blazing or take your time-really open environement-liberty to play with terrain and weapons-interesting world-upgrading system that permit player libertyCons:-the control of wall running are a tad clunky-the camera is not alway your best friend, but could be worst-barely any explaination on the world lord, your there and you kill baddies-incomplete (end on a ""to be continue..."")I virtually finish all avaible levels, from my gaming experience the first 80% of the game is pretty much a tutorial and when you unlock the second chronicle it is when the difficulty spike up a lot. It is not really an extremely hard game not at all rather the ennemies turn from total push overs to actually being able to kill you. The best way I could describe this game would be a sort of shoot them up mixed with a bullet hell, avoid the baddies and shoot the baddies.I personally liked the game, but it is really short, but I do believe it worth the price, especially when it is on sale. 19 cents for some game with more a less a good replay value. question of price/fun this game is well balanced.

												Very nostalgic, reminds me of PS1 games I played as a kid (sort of reminded me of terracon). The terrible camera control definitely added to this nostalgia, as I remember spending many a tantrum over not being able to see what my character was doing as a child.All sarcasm aside, I enjoyed the fast paced gameplay, and didn't even care that I sold the trading cards for a cent less than what I paid, this is a 9/10 game, definitely worth a play.

												This game certainly looks dated (to put it mildly), but it employs a number of gameplay mechanics that I've never seen before, and I had no trouble getting into it.There is a story, or at least the skeleton of one. I either don't remember the details, or none were offered up.The gameplay is where this title shines. You'll find yourself having to change the face of the terrain in several levels in order to accomlish your objectives. I'd say more, but I don't want to give too much away.I hope the developers of this game go on to bigger and better things. There are some great ideas in this game, and they don't suffer from the game's simple design. This is an interesting little game, well worth purchasing while on sale.			",64,9,0,5,2,2,1

												I remember I was on vacation in Cape May when I found this game.  I bought it because it was on sale for $0.19.  Little did I know, I had just purchased the greatest game ever made.  The game looked terrible, crashed constantly, and was insanely difficult, but after doing great amounts of research, I found out that the game was actually made in the year 2564, and is simply not meant to be played on any technological device of this era.  The mechanics and graphics are in fact actually SO advanced that they made a full circle in their quality and ended up looking worse than Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase for the Sony Playstation 1.  The game is clearly glitched from the most basic files up because it is being played in a world that isn't yet ready for it.  I urge you to buy Caster in hopes that with enough exposure, modern sciences can better analyze its ways and create a device capable of providing the world with its technological advances 510 years early.  For the good of this world and all worlds to come, please buy Caster.			",38,9,0,3,4,0,2

												[ENG] Seriously is this a game? At the price of 3 Euros? LOL. I just bought this game for 30 cents with a random coupon, i'm playing it just for trading cards... Even if the game was released in 2009, it has a very bad graphic and the gameplay is very stupid. Maybe it could be nice for its simplicity, but seriously, it's nothing special... this could be a random flashgame on the internet. I would not spend more than 5/15 cents.[ITA] Seriamente questo è un gioco? Al prezzo di 3 euro? LOL. L'ho comprato per 30 centesimi con un coupon, ci gioco giusto per le carte collezionabili...

Forse proprio per questo e quindi per la sua semplicità può piacere, ma seriamente, non è niente di speciale... potrebbe tranquillamente essere un flashgame su internet.

												Quite literally, I have seen worse games than this. I bought this game for $0.17, worth it. $2.99? Ehh, not really. I've seen better games that are cheaper (even the ones that aren't on sale, ex: Orion: Prelude) Once you get the upgrades for your characters (and not the guns just yet, except the first one you get) it's just going around the whole map in seconds, shooting everything! If you see the game on sale and you have nothing to do for an hour or so, you should get this game. Best game ever? Far from it. But, I could of seen this game being probably a really fun game on the classic consoles (ps1, n64, snes, and possibly a sega 32x or sega cd. But, considering those consoles only have so much they can do, i would probably think ps2, dreamcast, xbox, and gamecube would be the only ones to be able to handle it. Plus, this game would have probably been a game that was at launch with the consoles, showing off what the consoles could handle. Also, once you know what you're doing, you can beat the game pretty easily). So, all in all, it's not bad. I would just recommend if you're killing time and feel like just destroying a big map, this game is a time killer for you.			",65,1,0,4,1,0,7

												Gameplay is somewhat ok, other than that its bad. Its like playing megaman on 3D with the same graphic as megaman X from the 90s. The control is badn, its way too hard to aim unless you have a perfect sensitivity, which is hard since the sensitivity option is very limited. Once you finish about 2 levels, it  gets repetitive and boring mostly because there is no story. And don't forget the characters' faces, they look like PS1 charachters.			",16,2,0,0,2,0,1

												This game is consistently available for under 20 cents.It's not great, but it does two things exceedingly well that are rare features in many other games, AAA or indie:1) Fairly impressive terrain destruction. Instead of handling destructible terrain in the traditional way of having set destructible parts of the environment which will explode in a physics-based manner, Caster just creates entire levels out of fully terraform-able terrain. It's easy to create dents, craters, hills, and mountains out of the world around you on a whim, and that feels pretty cool.2) Empowering movement. Your character has two big movement abilities which make it very easy to cover huge distances in short time. There's a ""super jump,"" which behaves like a double jump with absurd height to it, and a dash ability which increases movement speed, and allows you to run on water and up any walls. It feels fantastic and I haven't played with anything quite like it before.Outside of those two features, Caster is pretty dull. The combat, music, aesthetics, graphics, and general polish are all sorely lacking. That said, if you can spare fifteen cents and fifteen minutes, I'd recommend checking this game out for just long enough to experience how fluid and satisfying it is to run around in this game's world.

												Fun, but incomplete.The game is fun, it is a little indy game with retro like graphics. it is less fast paced than it look like in the trailer, but the feeling of speed and liberty is great. Pros: -speed depend on the player, go all gun blazing or take your time-really open environement-liberty to play with terrain and weapons-interesting world-upgrading system that permit player libertyCons:-the control of wall running are a tad clunky-the camera is not alway your best friend, but could be worst-barely any explaination on the world lord, your there and you kill baddies-incomplete (end on a ""to be continue..."")I virtually finish all avaible levels, from my gaming experience the first 80% of the game is pretty much a tutorial and when you unlock the second chronicle it is when the difficulty spike up a lot. It is not really an extremely hard game not at all rather the ennemies turn from total push overs to actually being able to kill you. The best way I could describe this game would be a sort of shoot them up mixed with a bullet hell, avoid the baddies and shoot the baddies.I personally liked the game, but it is really short, but I do believe it worth the price, especially when it is on sale. 19 cents for some game with more a less a good replay value. question of price/fun this game is well balanced.

Sprinting and jumping over huge distances, scaling mountains, and running circles around enemies is a blast. The powers allow you to raise or lower terrain, shoot homing missiles, slow down enemies, and more - Very fun!

												Caster is an unchallenged masterpieced with next generation graphics (for 1980). It's enticing story line and playtime is rivalled only by the intense cliffhanger and the tension of what is to become to the protagonist in the much anticipated sequel. 10/10 would buy this game (for 0.14).

												I have to say ""No"" to this game. Sure I got it for 14 cents, but that was on the Steam Summer sale, usually it's $3 and I can't recommend this game for $3. Some history. I first played Caster when it first came out on the IOS in 2009. I had a fun time, but was dissipointed when I got a ""To be Continued"" screen. Imagine my excitement now in 2015 when I could pick up the game again 6 years later! Sadly, it did not hold up in the years. No progress has been made to the game whatsoever. I checked the guys website and while this is a side project, he seems to have started working on other things. I found 2 ""update"" posts on updating caster in the past 3 years, but so far nothing has changed. I feel like the person who made this game just wants to move on and this game will never be finished.Story wise it's meh. You are a Caster which are people who fight against creatures called the Flux. You are coming out to be a prodigy, and are a great asset to the Caster Community with your help in the research of Nega Orbs. That's where it ends because the game isn't finished. It's an interesting concept, but it's not execute to its full potential. 3/10Graphics wise, its decent. The enviroments are nice considering its very basic. A few issues I had are mostly with the main character. He looks horrible. While from behind it's ok, his face is terrifying I couldn't help but be pulled away from the experience everytime I saw his messed up eyes and weird smile. I really would want to change it. Also his animation cycles are also meh. With his run and jump being but faster or holding it, I feel it could have been approached diffrently. 5/10Music is pretty good. Honestly if it wasn't for the music, this game would be way more lacking. It's good electronic for the setting. Nothing else to really say about it. 7.5/10Gameplay is mixed. At first, you start off pathetically weak as the first 2-3 missions are a challenge. But then Early Mid game becomes fun as you level up your abilties. You actually feel very powerful with the destruction of the envirmont, almost godlike. However, later on the game falls off. Missions are repeated, just in diffrent stages. Enemies either take way to many hits for the ""powerful"" feeling. Or they are impossible to hit like the flys. No joke, I spent a good 10 minutes trying to kill a group of flys, because the only way to hit them is with the seeker power, and even that it's almost impossible. Creature design was pretty fun, I especially like the battle with the flux that would grab you and slow you down, but most of the enemies are boring. The one's that really do shine are the bosses and the creatures with abilities like yours. The game also moves to fast for it's own good. I had a hard time being able to hit enemies because I had to run at max speed dodging bullets while I tried my best to charge and fire my shots. Also most of the abilities are kinda worthless. The blue laser, the seeker and the land destory abilites are the only real abilities you should put into besides one mission were you need to use the land build up to move a orb to the other end. 5/10Final Verdict 5.5/10. It's a fun game that you can play to burn up an hour or so. But I can't recommend getting this game at the full $3. It's a bit weird and won't keep you invested and finally, you will never see this game finished most likely.			",49,8,0,11,4,2,4

												I do not see any real reason this game should have bad reviews other than personal expectations being set too high.Right now it is 20 cents, I bought this game back when I first got my account, I still buy copies to give away or to encourage a trade.The simplistic nature of the levels pairs well with the arcade feel to the platforming action shooting gameplay.Yes the graphics are kind of oldish, but why complain, you play on PC... everything back to the text adventures can be had on your super rig, not just the hyper 3D flare.Really, you just blast stuff and upgrade your weapons.  The ability to morph the terrain is just great, and really reminded me of my time spent digging holes through levels in the first Red Faction.If you liked Mega Man 64, or maybe P.N.03 you really can't go wrong with a low requirement 20 cent title like this.A game like this EASILY could have been in an arcade, 25 cents a go.Like I said, the only real reason for a negative review from anyone boils down to their personal expectations, even if the game ends up feeling a bit like a work in progress, it works and it is fun.

												Was this worth 20 cents of my time, yes.  Is it worth it full price, HELL no.  The game feels more like a proof on concept than anything else unfortunately.  The different weapons were what kept me entertained and leveling them up.  As for the rest, remarkably uninteresting and forgettable.  There was some snow... a big thing... a big thing that split into many other annoying things... and more snow. It's worth 20 cents, not much else.			",148,11,0,25,3,1,6

The game is unfinished as once you reach the final level it says to check a website for further updates, but the game came out in 2009 so I dont forsee any more updates.

												There are some GREAT ideas, and some terrible execution.First is terrain deformation, at first you think COOL! they figured it out, that's awesome. However, in reality the game is using auto generated planes as 'terrain'. and the deformation is either a + or - in height. There is NO other detail or deformation other than height. The texture is low quality, and doesn't deform with the mesh, so you get stretched and grainy textures all over the place. In addition to this, the tiniest 'down' deformation on an otherwise flat area will trap your character, stopping you in your tracks. Super annoying, and a tip that the terrain is calculated as a series of boxes, instead of a mesh (lets stack boxes under a blanket, and ignore the fact that you run into the box and can't move, despite the blanket still being flat).Second is the mouse controls. Do you really expect anyone to play at such a low mouse movement speed? I'm REALLY glad I've got a G9x where I can adjust sensitivity on the fly. The menus are great on my 'normal' but at this speed it takes 6 swipes across my XXL mousepad for me to look in a circle. I adjust it up once, and it takes 3... which is reasonable. Then there is the fact that you start each level staring at your feet. You can move like normal in this view, which caused my death in the training... I was shooting my feet the entire level. AND this is the normal start for EVERY level.Lastly, Powerups are cool, but the default 4 are the obvious choices. ""oh, I can pull money from the entire map if I level up this one first?... nah, I'ma go with leveling up a weapon first."" The lack of damage counters, or additional effects also makes any weapon upgrades underwhelming.

												my first impression of Caster was ""Darn, that's ugly! And the running animation looks really stupid."" However, once I got into the game, the graphics were completely forgotten.It's a fun game to play when you want to destroy a horde of enemies by endlessly blasting, zip around the map at superspeed or nearly fly with a superjump.My only big complaint so far is, it is too short.

												I do not see any real reason this game should have bad reviews other than personal expectations being set too high.Right now it is 20 cents, I bought this game back when I first got my account, I still buy copies to give away or to encourage a trade.The simplistic nature of the levels pairs well with the arcade feel to the platforming action shooting gameplay.Yes the graphics are kind of oldish, but why complain, you play on PC... everything back to the text adventures can be had on your super rig, not just the hyper 3D flare.Really, you just blast stuff and upgrade your weapons.  The ability to morph the terrain is just great, and really reminded me of my time spent digging holes through levels in the first Red Faction.If you liked Mega Man 64, or maybe P.N.03 you really can't go wrong with a low requirement 20 cent title like this.A game like this EASILY could have been in an arcade, 25 cents a go.Like I said, the only real reason for a negative review from anyone boils down to their personal expectations, even if the game ends up feeling a bit like a work in progress, it works and it is fun.

												A fun little ""blast all the things"" game with a bit of a twist. Terrain damage starts to matter after awhile; too deep and your in acid, too high and your in poison cluds. different shots affect the terrain in different ways, giving you some control. However the ""create terrain"" shot seems to make spikes better than flat ground, leading to really awkward terrain.For the price, it's a blast! You pretty quickly go from the one running away to blasting whole hordes of enemies! If you're looking for some frantic action and can look past the graphics being a little dated, can't do much better than this!			",56,14,0,8,2,0,11

												Well.... I have no idea what I expected for 14 cents but dang it really was something.Basically the map and graphics look like something from the N64/PS1 era except slightly more crudely made. (A rough 3D map tool basically) From there you take the speed of Sonic, the jumping ability of Moon Shoes on a Pogo Stick, the physics of Big Rigs, awesome mech warrior/magic powers, the landscaping tool from Rollercoaster Tycoon and combine  them into one game. And it is just... a once in a lifetime experience. Other then that, the game has some variety in missions, enemies, and things to do albeit very easy even on normal and ""extreme"" difficulties. For 14 cents... Yea, I'd go for it. It's something to remember.			",210,24,1,8,20,2,11

												I can see this being a test run for very, very new devolopers in the video game scene but it is not a completed project. It resembles a poorly made PS1 game in which the atmosphere of the game is very blank and dry, little to no features in it. The game itself physically looks like a Shooter met the Sims 2 environment creator. This game is not worth the time or the money if you are seriously interested, but if you have throwaround money and a spare two hours of your time then go for it.Pros: Very cheap cost         Not graphically intensiveCons: Everything starting after the game loads          Weak and generic storyline, no depth          Looks like a failed PS1 title          Makes you reconsider your life decisions			",29,6,0,7,2,0,14

												This game has a few issues. Now if you enjoy it that's cool. But here are my issues:1. It is not finished, and they do not work on it anymore. I got to the second map, and they said there were going to be more levels. There have not been any new updates for a good deal of time. 2. The characters look like they belong in a 70's or 80's anime. There is no customization and the characters are kind of ugly.3. It doesn't have enough Powers. This game is based around the obtaining of powers to use agains the Flanx. You get all the powers pretty early, and as I said earlier, they do not have many levels. 4. There are mods, but most of the 6 do not work. This is a minor complaint though.Overall, it's not a terrible game, it just has a few more downs than ups. but if you want to try it, it honestly is worth the $2.99 + Tax.			",78,8,0,11,9,0,0

												I gave this game a chance, then another, then I asked my friend to try it, it all resulted in the same verdict: complete wate of time. Graphics are aweful, even on a retro game level but the worst are the controls, which are totally unintuitive. It's as if someone tried to make a game that had all the flaws of the worst PS1 games. Seriously: I read some positive reviews and I couldn't make out if the writers were trying to troll me. Possibly, the game gets better after playing it for one hour, or five hours, or maybe fifty but I don't really care because the first half hour was so awfully annoying that I regret even trying it.

Although by modern standarts the graphics are somewhat 'simple' but the game does compensate well by introducing interesting array of 'powers' to be upgraded and used in the missions.  The level architecture is well done and poses different challenges as you progress through the game. Thumbs up to the developers and a strong recommendation.			",91,8,2,6,4,0,7

												I have to say ""No"" to this game. Sure I got it for 14 cents, but that was on the Steam Summer sale, usually it's $3 and I can't recommend this game for $3. Some history. I first played Caster when it first came out on the IOS in 2009. I had a fun time, but was dissipointed when I got a ""To be Continued"" screen. Imagine my excitement now in 2015 when I could pick up the game again 6 years later! Sadly, it did not hold up in the years. No progress has been made to the game whatsoever. I checked the guys website and while this is a side project, he seems to have started working on other things. I found 2 ""update"" posts on updating caster in the past 3 years, but so far nothing has changed. I feel like the person who made this game just wants to move on and this game will never be finished.Story wise it's meh. You are a Caster which are people who fight against creatures called the Flux. You are coming out to be a prodigy, and are a great asset to the Caster Community with your help in the research of Nega Orbs. That's where it ends because the game isn't finished. It's an interesting concept, but it's not execute to its full potential. 3/10Graphics wise, its decent. The enviroments are nice considering its very basic. A few issues I had are mostly with the main character. He looks horrible. While from behind it's ok, his face is terrifying I couldn't help but be pulled away from the experience everytime I saw his messed up eyes and weird smile. I really would want to change it. Also his animation cycles are also meh. With his run and jump being but faster or holding it, I feel it could have been approached diffrently. 5/10Music is pretty good. Honestly if it wasn't for the music, this game would be way more lacking. It's good electronic for the setting. Nothing else to really say about it. 7.5/10Gameplay is mixed. At first, you start off pathetically weak as the first 2-3 missions are a challenge. But then Early Mid game becomes fun as you level up your abilties. You actually feel very powerful with the destruction of the envirmont, almost godlike. However, later on the game falls off. Missions are repeated, just in diffrent stages. Enemies either take way to many hits for the ""powerful"" feeling. Or they are impossible to hit like the flys. No joke, I spent a good 10 minutes trying to kill a group of flys, because the only way to hit them is with the seeker power, and even that it's almost impossible. Creature design was pretty fun, I especially like the battle with the flux that would grab you and slow you down, but most of the enemies are boring. The one's that really do shine are the bosses and the creatures with abilities like yours. The game also moves to fast for it's own good. I had a hard time being able to hit enemies because I had to run at max speed dodging bullets while I tried my best to charge and fire my shots. Also most of the abilities are kinda worthless. The blue laser, the seeker and the land destory abilites are the only real abilities you should put into besides one mission were you need to use the land build up to move a orb to the other end. 5/10Final Verdict 5.5/10. It's a fun game that you can play to burn up an hour or so. But I can't recommend getting this game at the full $3. It's a bit weird and won't keep you invested and finally, you will never see this game finished most likely.			",49,8,0,11,4,2,4

												Well, this was a surprise. I saw this for $0.17 about and purchased it on a sale. I downloaded it on the side, and said that I'd eventually give it a shot. I was not expecting much but I was surprised!The gameplay is very fun, and the concept of the game has a lot of potential (you can terraform with your guns). On the other hand it feels like the game might have needed more work.There are mechanisms for storytelling, but they were not used to the fullest potential - in fact if the game had a writer or some good storyteller, I could easilly see this incorporating a simple, but nice story along all the action.You can expect 2-4 hours of gaming if you casually play this game.Apparently there's mods but I haven't really tried anything out yet.I would recommend this game on a sale (or not) if you don't mind a few rough edges!

												This is a kind of a bullet hell game,it has alot of energy blasts flying everywhere when you are fighting and thats really itThe graphics arent very great,it feel like n64....and the main male character looks like the kid from Quest64 too.But it makes up for it very well by build really fluid and feeling great to move around and fight.The music fits really well to the battle and style of the game,and it all works amazingly wellThe power ups you use to fight can also be used to change the land around you which is really fun and a neat idea.The enemies are kinda generic and are all pretty easy but the combat is still fun with the how short the game is kinda works in its favor where you dont really notice the repeating fightsI beat the game in about an hour,I didnt 100% every level but it still wouldnt add that much time to the overall playthrough,There is one level that i found to just be made to be annoying and bad,basically mixing terrible A.I. and weird terraforming power ups and it turns the enjoyable experience into something i hated and almost gave up the game but i wanted to give it a fair chance.(and plus the level is in the 2nd part of the game)Overall,this game was way above my expectations and i really enjoyed most of it(that one level i really hated) Play it for a short and fun time			",228,28,6,43,9,0,24

												Quite literally, I have seen worse games than this. I bought this game for $0.17, worth it. $2.99? Ehh, not really. I've seen better games that are cheaper (even the ones that aren't on sale, ex: Orion: Prelude) Once you get the upgrades for your characters (and not the guns just yet, except the first one you get) it's just going around the whole map in seconds, shooting everything! If you see the game on sale and you have nothing to do for an hour or so, you should get this game. Best game ever? Far from it. But, I could of seen this game being probably a really fun game on the classic consoles (ps1, n64, snes, and possibly a sega 32x or sega cd. But, considering those consoles only have so much they can do, i would probably think ps2, dreamcast, xbox, and gamecube would be the only ones to be able to handle it. Plus, this game would have probably been a game that was at launch with the consoles, showing off what the consoles could handle. Also, once you know what you're doing, you can beat the game pretty easily). So, all in all, it's not bad. I would just recommend if you're killing time and feel like just destroying a big map, this game is a time killer for you.			",65,1,0,4,1,0,7

												This game certainly looks dated (to put it mildly), but it employs a number of gameplay mechanics that I've never seen before, and I had no trouble getting into it.There is a story, or at least the skeleton of one. I either don't remember the details, or none were offered up.The gameplay is where this title shines. You'll find yourself having to change the face of the terrain in several levels in order to accomlish your objectives. I'd say more, but I don't want to give too much away.I hope the developers of this game go on to bigger and better things. There are some great ideas in this game, and they don't suffer from the game's simple design. This is an interesting little game, well worth purchasing while on sale.			",64,9,0,5,2,2,1

												Not a great engine, visuals are very mediocre and I randomly got stuck on inclines for no apparent reason. Funnily enough, you can normally dash up vertical inclines; the level 'Treacherous Tower' allows you to dash straight up to the exit and skip the level. Pretty generic action shooter, there isn't really a story. Levels aren't really too varied in objectives or visuals. The only things that exist in this world are you, enemies, trees and the terrain. There are several varied types of weapons and shooting the terrain can change it (usually lower/raise). You don't really use the terrain until the second chapter (currently 'To Be Continued'), where one unique level requires you 'escort' a ball to the exit point by raising the terrain in front of it to remove the acid.I first upgraded Dash and Pulse and could skip enemies, collect orbs, and skip through the levels. You don't need to fight enemies in most levels. After upgrades, you have pretty good mobility to run around, shoot things and collect orbs which is the whole game (or run around, avoid things and collect orbs like me).If you don't care about graphics or story and just want to run around shooting random things and collect orbs, then you might like this game. This seems more fit as a decent 3rd-party game for the N64. It's not a terrible game, but there doesn't seem to be a point to continue playing except if you like the combat for mindless fun.

												  Ever so sweet and oh so simple. A beautiful mix of modern and retro styles; the music, the physics, the monsters... this is definitely a game you might expect to find in a modern cici's pizza arcade room. It's the kind of game you'd spend $25 in quarters on over the course of just one summer. That is, if you're playing on hard mode. Casual and novice gamers can still play for hours on end, but a certain balance of the environment is lost without feeling the heat. Either way, it's an eerily elegant adventure with little story and expansive gameplay. Only two things are missing to make this game an instant classic: a music album for purchase, and multiplayer mode, but something tells me both are in the works. So, yeah, you've got a great deal staring you in the face. Get it before they start charging what it's truly worth. ",105,59,1,10,9,0,9

												Got this game for £ 0.14...What's good:- Music is pretty good- Terraforming/destruction of ground- Prettyyyyyy colours- Pace of game is slow at first but there is a character weapon/skill leveling system- Tutorial is friendly as hell... or should that be heaven?What's not so good:- Levels at first are mostly the same- Could do with a bit more dialogue, possibly spoken.- No unique enemy monster attacks- Loses its challenging feel after fully leveling up- Lack of man made scenery/structures on levels- Game was a part time project no longer updated as far as i'm aware			",89,17,1,5,13,3,5

												This game certainly looks dated (to put it mildly), but it employs a number of gameplay mechanics that I've never seen before, and I had no trouble getting into it.There is a story, or at least the skeleton of one. I either don't remember the details, or none were offered up.The gameplay is where this title shines. You'll find yourself having to change the face of the terrain in several levels in order to accomlish your objectives. I'd say more, but I don't want to give too much away.I hope the developers of this game go on to bigger and better things. There are some great ideas in this game, and they don't suffer from the game's simple design. This is an interesting little game, well worth purchasing while on sale.			",64,9,0,5,2,2,1

												Well.... I have no idea what I expected for 14 cents but dang it really was something.Basically the map and graphics look like something from the N64/PS1 era except slightly more crudely made. (A rough 3D map tool basically) From there you take the speed of Sonic, the jumping ability of Moon Shoes on a Pogo Stick, the physics of Big Rigs, awesome mech warrior/magic powers, the landscaping tool from Rollercoaster Tycoon and combine  them into one game. And it is just... a once in a lifetime experience. Other then that, the game has some variety in missions, enemies, and things to do albeit very easy even on normal and ""extreme"" difficulties. For 14 cents... Yea, I'd go for it. It's something to remember.			",210,24,1,8,20,2,11

												This game has a few issues. Now if you enjoy it that's cool. But here are my issues:1. It is not finished, and they do not work on it anymore. I got to the second map, and they said there were going to be more levels. There have not been any new updates for a good deal of time. 2. The characters look like they belong in a 70's or 80's anime. There is no customization and the characters are kind of ugly.3. It doesn't have enough Powers. This game is based around the obtaining of powers to use agains the Flanx. You get all the powers pretty early, and as I said earlier, they do not have many levels. 4. There are mods, but most of the 6 do not work. This is a minor complaint though.Overall, it's not a terrible game, it just has a few more downs than ups. but if you want to try it, it honestly is worth the $2.99 + Tax.			",78,8,0,11,9,0,0

												I gave this game a chance, then another, then I asked my friend to try it, it all resulted in the same verdict: complete wate of time. Graphics are aweful, even on a retro game level but the worst are the controls, which are totally unintuitive. It's as if someone tried to make a game that had all the flaws of the worst PS1 games. Seriously: I read some positive reviews and I couldn't make out if the writers were trying to troll me. Possibly, the game gets better after playing it for one hour, or five hours, or maybe fifty but I don't really care because the first half hour was so awfully annoying that I regret even trying it.

												Very nice RPG game.The graphics look like that this game came out in PS2 generation. I don't really mind about the graphics so this game looks beautiful to me. Plenty of levels and the enemies you face can be challenging. You have 6 abilities and they are upgradable. There are abilities that have the power to cultivate or raise the ground. I recommend this game to those who want to past time playing a quick RPG game. And if your system specs are not for high end gaming, this game would run very fine even on weak notebooks like mine.  10/10  ",73,14,3,9,3,0,1

												This simple title was a pleasant suprise. Although by modern standarts the graphics are somewhat 'simple' but the game does compensate well by introducing interesting array of 'powers' to be upgraded and used in the missions.  The level architecture is well done and poses different challenges as you progress through the game. Thumbs up to the developers and a strong recommendation.			",91,8,2,6,4,0,7

												This game is actually a lot of fun for the price. Starts out slow, but builds quickly as you unlock more and more abilities in subsequent levels, and it soon becomes downright addicting.  It's like a fast-paced 3d platformer that's also a shooter with the sorts of weaponry I've come to expect from top-down airplane variety shooters, and it actually works pretty well.  It's got N64 era graphics which might disappoint some, but it flows smoothly and they work with the world.  Pretty solid mechanics and enough variety to keep me entertained riiiiight up until some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t escort mission that I can't be arsed to finish, because ♥♥♥♥ escort missions. Still, that first 2/3rds of the game is pretty fun. It'll keep you amused for at least a few hours, longer if you can beat the level that I quit on.  For five bucks, it's definitely recommended.

												I bought this game for $.14, and for that amount of money it's worth it. The graphics are ridiculously dated. Older farts like me will remember the original ""Jedi Knight"" with an early 3D add-on card that looked amazing. We're talking mid-to-late 1990s here. Yes, this game looks worse than that.As much as I hate to admit it, as crappy as the graphical quality is, the game is actually kind of fun but not for prolonged amounts of time. It doesn't take much to build up your various characteristics (weapons, shield, speed, etc.) and you're not going to get a lot of gameplay out of it.Buy this game when it's available for less than $.50 and mess around with it until you get your cards. The game probably won't get played much more after that, though.			",305,203,3,17,19,0,9

												I found this game by browsing through steams cheapest line-up.Let me tell you, just from playing Beginner difficulty, the game length changes depending on the difficulty setting you choose which I mean makes levels longer.The Graphics are actually pretty good, considering it has a nostalgic low-poly feel.The Gameplay is outstanding and I really enjoyed the upgrade system.The only two complaints that I have is the fact that the game is so damn short, one play through took me 90 minutes.The other is in the 3 stage of the Legonia Chronicles, you aren't given any indication of what to do to the nega orb.You have to either wing it or look up how to do it online. (You descend the ground to make it fall into acid)Which brings up another point, helping the infected tree inside that level before you destroy the orb breaks the levl.			",211,23,8,28,11,1,12

												Picked this up for £0.09 and for the price, definitely worth it, if only for the money back from trading cards. The game doesn't look great, or even play very great, but it's not bad for wasting an hour or two, but that's pretty much all the playtime you will get from it, the first level was quite difficult if only because of the speed that the enemies move, and how slow you are until you have a few upgrades, after you have bought an upgrade or two though the difficulty nose dives, with only giant homing missile seeking firing rock? monsters being the only thing that can really hurt you, though with ant of the starter weapons maxed out they do go down fairly quickly. As long as it is on sale, I would say this game is worth a try, however I would never pay £2.00 for this.			",174,46,3,36,12,3,47

												The game is okay. I mean, It's kind of not so well done, and very rushed feeling, but It's okay.It's basically Sonic with an energy bar. It has a small range of weapons, basically powers for one gun that is given to you. I mean, the game is all skill, sort of. The bosses are tough, regular flying enemies are nearly impossible to kill without a special slowdown gun or whatever, so until you can get that power, those flying enemies are hard as all hell to kill, kind of ruins the game for me. You get your second weapon after a few minutes, then you get a new weapon every level, which just feels overly rushed. The health system is kind of like Halo's, where It's less of being health, and more of a shield, but you can't really die, you just respawn where you died.Overall,4/10TL;DR Can be enjoyed for a quick ten minutes, gets tedious, and old fast.

												This game isn't perfect. But hell if it isn't bloody good. You know why? Because it's pure, simple, innocent fun. It's so much fun. All you do is jump and run around really fast while shooting your various magic spells at stuff. That's literally the entire game. I could do a full blown review of the graphics, and the sound quality, and the ""story"", and all of this, that and the other.But I'm not going to. You don't need that, and I don't want to write that. All I need to tell you, all you need to know, is that this game is fun. And in the sea of games out there fighting for the money in your bank account, this is one of the few that actually deserves it.			",28,9,0,8,12,3,10

												This is a neat little gem that I believe many will pass on just because of the graphics. However you guys should really pick this up. It's its a fast third person shooter packed full of fun. You can upgrade your spells and other stats. The action is a bit dull at first but once you increase or get the other spells swapping through spells dashing and super jumping to take down enemies and change the terrains elevation is pretty darn neat.Also the game has an amazing soundtrack I very much enjoyed speeding around zapping flanx to some nice techno music! The game has a bit of narrative but nothing overwhelming your the new caster and your job is to heal the area by collecting energy, defeat enemies known as the Flanx, and heal the trees... BY SHOOTING THEM WITH LASERS! It's pretty darn neato if I do say so myself.I very much enjoyed it and i think you will too.			",613,210,9,122,44,3,55

												Best emoticons ever.In this game you shoot and dodge stuff and get orbs, while getting new powers.You can upgrade your weapons and other stuff through cash you get from missions.You and your opponetts can shape the terrain with your attacks, which was a pleasant suprise.Defeating enemies is fun and simple, don't ever stop moving though, or you'll get hit.Don't expect an in-depth game though, or you'll get bored.The textures can be muddy and unappealing, especially the protogonist's face...The game can feel empty... because it kinda is. There's not much to do other than shoot enemies, get orbs, upgrade, then repeat. They do show new enemie types and the aforementioned powers, which spruce up the game.I give this game a 7/10, it's a nice shooter game with simple controls and simple gameplay, but it suffers from lack of depth.

												For the little I spent for this game, I did not expect to have such frantic fun throughout my short playthrough. Reminiscent of a budget GunValkyrie crossed with a bit of MegaMan. While you start out very week and vulnerable, within a few levels your character becomes a map jumping, earthshaping war machine that somehow surpasses the multimillion dollar budget that Fracture had, as awful as that game was.That being said, even with a decent amount of levels, you'll be able to collect just about everything and wipe out the main story within a couple hours. The real meat is found in community made maps, but by the time I got there the game had lost its draw as I had seen just about all I was going to see.The combat is fairly fluid, and a variety of weapons with multiple functions offering your preference of extermination. There are some extremely basic puzzles, and a good handful of secrets, all adding up to upgrading your tools, but once you max everything out, that's it. The rest is just for personal achievement. You can always start a new game on a higher difficulty, but there isn't any bonus content that I could percieve. I've poured hundreds of hours into vacant games and came away with only the ghost of fun, but this, for the short time it offers it, is a more genuinely fun experience, and left me wanting more. While the late game levels were a bit more tedious than anything else, I was engrossed in reviving trees and blowing holes in the earth. For a sale or even for its base price, Caster is a short and charming experience that definitely struck a cord with me. A game that even without the story and collectables is a blast to play, and really, isn't that what made a lot of us fall in love with games to begin with?			",435,225,7,73,34,5,72

												I bough this game for the price.I like it.You can run like sonic and jump a lot.You learn new abilities as you beat the levels.You can use your abilities to kill the enemies.One cool thing is that you can use your abilities to break the terrain and dig holes where you can trap your enemies.Controls are really confortable.The AI is not very good.The graphics are beatiful dispite not having many polygons.9/10Reco			",32,11,1,3,4,0,4

												There's no denying it. This game is fun.I'm not sure what to plot is, or what the ultimate goal of the game is. Heck, half the time I don't even know what I'm doing during a level. The main thing this game has going for it is it's just fun. You can jump around, manuever around the map quickly, and even mold the terrain. There's just something about dodging lasers while shooting a monster (Flanx) and jumping around that is just really enjoyable and satisfying. I bought this game with little expectations, but I expect to be playing it quite a bit in the future.Also, you can shoot trees. And they grow REALLY big. It's awesome.			",93,25,0,17,8,0,11

 CASTER On the surface, Caster is a generic third-person shooter with absolutely horrid graphics.Have you heard of a little phrase that goes ""Don't judge a book by it's cover""? I know its cliche, but, Caster fits into that little phrase perfectly.Play beyond the original generic shooting and bad graphics and you'll find several fun and interesting things.To list a few:A fun and smooth movement systemInteresting and diverse enemy typesPower-up abilities AND enemies that affect the terrain of the levelA multitude of different levels, with community support for even more levelsTo be honest, I've had more fun with this game than some games that cost 10x the amount this does, mainly because of the mechanics it includes that, on paper, seem game-breaking and/or horrible but actually make the game extremely fun. For example, in one of the first few missions, I was running along when I run into this huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ scorpion thing that comes out of the ground and shoots a giant reflective ball at me. Naturally, I move out of the way of the ball and look to where it lands and realise that it just created terrain. I swear I spent about 15 minutes just screwing around with what was now my new best friend and making what was once a grassy plain into a deslote wasteland full of mountains. Its that sort of thing that makes me love this game. Not to mention, not long after that mission, you get a powerup that lets you shoot, get this: THE BALLS THE FREAKING SCORPIONS CAN SHOOT. That point is the happiest any game has ever made me feel. However this powerup is a little unbalanced, as it does ridiculous amounts of damage AND is AOE. Basically, this game is full of silliness like that and it is surprisingly fun. I would recommend it to anyone who just wants to screw around with a game.			",103,12,0,11,9,1,14

												  Ever so sweet and oh so simple. A beautiful mix of modern and retro styles; the music, the physics, the monsters... this is definitely a game you might expect to find in a modern cici's pizza arcade room. It's the kind of game you'd spend $25 in quarters on over the course of just one summer. That is, if you're playing on hard mode. Casual and novice gamers can still play for hours on end, but a certain balance of the environment is lost without feeling the heat. Either way, it's an eerily elegant adventure with little story and expansive gameplay. Only two things are missing to make this game an instant classic: a music album for purchase, and multiplayer mode, but something tells me both are in the works. So, yeah, you've got a great deal staring you in the face. Get it before they start charging what it's truly worth. ",105,59,1,10,9,0,9

												I really enjoy this game. I expected a load of garbage based off how low the price was (+sale was only 14 cents!), but I found myself having a really good time. I love games like Crackdown and Saint's Row 4 that allow you to fly, run, and jump at incredible speeds. Caster is just like that, but then again, it's not. The game feels (and looks) like it was a test run for the developer. There's no real story, graphics look like a cross-breed of N64 and PS1, and the levels are small and have almost nothing of interest in them. However, the physics in this game were very interesting. Certain attacks did certain things, like leveling the ground or erecting it. You're attacks can also ""heal"" trees, which I thought was pretty nifty. The enemies are creepy, and (even though they were nearly barren) the maps were fun to explore. I spent the first maybe ten minutes of the game just messing around with the physics, jumping and running around, shooting holes into the ground, just having a fun little time. I hope the devs make something out of this game (or finish/update it), I honestly love it. For 14 cents, yeah, I do recommend this game. However, for five bucks? Maybe not. Basically, if you're lucky enough to see this ""review"" before the sale ends, what's spending/blowing 14 cents? It's not going to harm you. (At least, I hope it doesn't.) So why not check this little gem out? And hey, if you end up loathing the game, you can just sell the card drops for a profit. It's a win/win. So whatta ya say?			",108,20,0,8,5,0,5

												First of all, I purchased this game for a mere € 0,14 which is almost insulting to the developer. But alas, as I stream cheap games every Tuesday I just had to try this one, and after 3 hours of streaming me and my viewers were not disappointed.""Caster"" reminded my viewers of Megaman and Sonic games from the past, a genre I was never good at because of the speed of gameplay required. But this game is pretty easy on normal, so I did not die as often as I expected and had a great time killing the few enemies present and gathering the objectives.The graphics are simple, but after an hour of playing I did not notice it anymore and was just busy doing things that had to be done to complete the levels. At first I turned down the music in the game, which I often do, but was I wrong: the electronic beats are what make this game better than what you first think when you start it. They push you to greater hights and I would not mind having a few of those songs in my iTunes library.After 3 hours of playing, near the end of my planned streaming session, the game crashed on me, but nothing was lost, I could start it up again and play from where I last was. I have yet to finish it, which I cetrainly will, and do not regret buying this game and spending an evening on it. It has been a long time since € 0,14 gave me this much fun...

												This is My first review in a while so it may be a little rough sorry if someSpelling mistakes are made anywayCaster is a 3d shooter with a lot of character creation you can change your sex,gender and that's pretty much it, though don't worry because the character looks just as good as the ones inCastlevania 64, the enemy's are really unique on the second level IFound a beetle in a tortoise shell and don't even get me started on the shift keywhich The best key if you wish to be Dash form the incredibles for a couple seconds (can be upgraded),also ifYou shoot dead trees they come back to life and give you credit (the games currency)overall the game can be enjoyable and it is quite cheap, it also didn't give me any problems or crashes soRead the review as you may but, I actually enjoyed the game for the short period ofTime I played it			",213,37,5,28,27,3,11

												Dirt cheap on steam sale, pretty fun for the price, i mean i think the only other thing you could buy this cheap is like a single stick of gum, you chew that for 30 mins and its gone, whereas this youll atleast get a few hours out of it. I like to throw it up on the 2nd monitor and play it while league is queueing or loading. Pros1. The price obviously2. Very fluid controls for a cheap game, doesnt feel clunky at all (just make sure to adjust mouse sensitivity)3. Pretty decent music, definitely easy to zone out on4. It might not have the best graphics but its actually fun to playCons1. Zero depth, zilch, none, if this was a pizza it would be those little dollar totinos pizzas, its not great but hey its there!2. Very little diversity among enemies, you have the ones that shoot at you and the ones that move and shoot at youIn all honesty throw this same style of game in a new game engine with modern graphics, add some voice acting and a few cutscenes with some more enemy diversity and i would happily pay 20 bucks for it.

Even if the game was released in 2009, it has a very bad graphic and the gameplay is very stupid. Maybe it could be nice for its simplicity, but seriously, it's nothing special... this could be a random flashgame on the internet.

The control is badn, its way too hard to aim unless you have a perfect sensitivity, which is hard since the sensitivity option is very limited. Once you finish about 2 levels, it  gets repetitive and boring mostly because there is no story. And don't forget the characters' faces, they look like PS1 charachters.			",16,2,0,0,2,0,1

												An underrated and fun third-person shooter with customizable weaponry and powers, Caster offers a fast pace, an addictive game-play and great in-game music, while suffering very few flaws, namely its length and the graphics, which to some may appear crude. I highly recommend it for everyone.			",108,24,2,23,9,0,2

												Well, this was a surprise. I saw this for $0.17 about and purchased it on a sale. I downloaded it on the side, and said that I'd eventually give it a shot. I was not expecting much but I was surprised!The gameplay is very fun, and the concept of the game has a lot of potential (you can terraform with your guns). On the other hand it feels like the game might have needed more work.There are mechanisms for storytelling, but they were not used to the fullest potential - in fact if the game had a writer or some good storyteller, I could easilly see this incorporating a simple, but nice story along all the action.You can expect 2-4 hours of gaming if you casually play this game.Apparently there's mods but I haven't really tried anything out yet.I would recommend this game on a sale (or not) if you don't mind a few rough edges!

												  Ever so sweet and oh so simple. A beautiful mix of modern and retro styles; the music, the physics, the monsters... this is definitely a game you might expect to find in a modern cici's pizza arcade room. It's the kind of game you'd spend $25 in quarters on over the course of just one summer. That is, if you're playing on hard mode. Casual and novice gamers can still play for hours on end, but a certain balance of the environment is lost without feeling the heat. Either way, it's an eerily elegant adventure with little story and expansive gameplay. Only two things are missing to make this game an instant classic: a music album for purchase, and multiplayer mode, but something tells me both are in the works. So, yeah, you've got a great deal staring you in the face. Get it before they start charging what it's truly worth. ",105,59,1,10,9,0,9

												There's no denying it. This game is fun.I'm not sure what to plot is, or what the ultimate goal of the game is. Heck, half the time I don't even know what I'm doing during a level. The main thing this game has going for it is it's just fun. You can jump around, manuever around the map quickly, and even mold the terrain. There's just something about dodging lasers while shooting a monster (Flanx) and jumping around that is just really enjoyable and satisfying. I bought this game with little expectations, but I expect to be playing it quite a bit in the future.Also, you can shoot trees. And they grow REALLY big. It's awesome.			",93,25,0,17,8,0,11

 CASTER On the surface, Caster is a generic third-person shooter with absolutely horrid graphics.Have you heard of a little phrase that goes ""Don't judge a book by it's cover""? I know its cliche, but, Caster fits into that little phrase perfectly.Play beyond the original generic shooting and bad graphics and you'll find several fun and interesting things.To list a few:A fun and smooth movement systemInteresting and diverse enemy typesPower-up abilities AND enemies that affect the terrain of the levelA multitude of different levels, with community support for even more levelsTo be honest, I've had more fun with this game than some games that cost 10x the amount this does, mainly because of the mechanics it includes that, on paper, seem game-breaking and/or horrible but actually make the game extremely fun. For example, in one of the first few missions, I was running along when I run into this huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ scorpion thing that comes out of the ground and shoots a giant reflective ball at me. Naturally, I move out of the way of the ball and look to where it lands and realise that it just created terrain. I swear I spent about 15 minutes just screwing around with what was now my new best friend and making what was once a grassy plain into a deslote wasteland full of mountains. Its that sort of thing that makes me love this game. Not to mention, not long after that mission, you get a powerup that lets you shoot, get this: THE BALLS THE FREAKING SCORPIONS CAN SHOOT. That point is the happiest any game has ever made me feel. However this powerup is a little unbalanced, as it does ridiculous amounts of damage AND is AOE. Basically, this game is full of silliness like that and it is surprisingly fun. I would recommend it to anyone who just wants to screw around with a game.			",103,12,0,11,9,1,14

Very few issues with the game, my only qualm being the overwhelming damage one of the enemies does to you in one of the levels near the end. Otherwise, it's a Nine-and-one-half out of Ten from me.

It is fun to fly through the levels and earn credits to upgrade your abilities at first, though it feels so EMPTY and lasting appeal suffers because of it.

												A short game that combines sandbox with MegaMan-esque power-ups. Two powers affect the terrain around you, which creates some diversity, two are for crowd control, and the other two are strictly for damage. Though personally, Blast (terrain damager) is the most powerful because of how fast you can fire it off and how much damage it does when fully charged.The levels have the same few objectives: go this tree/kill all the enemies/collect all the orbs. It's rather mundane, but for a fantasy? It's great. You run around each level, jumping really high and dashing really fast, obliterating everything in your way.At the current price ($1.99), I would not recommend it. During a sale, definitely.

Way better than AC Unity. EA Better be scared. Hype was real when me and 12 friends bought this. <3 I wish to add before I conclude this review that all of my friends were either drunk or just plain ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to spend 9p on this game. Does that make sense? Whatever.   To conclude, this game is worth a buy if its 50p or less. Anything above is silly. Get it for 9p.

												This game is actually a lot of fun for the price. Starts out slow, but builds quickly as you unlock more and more abilities in subsequent levels, and it soon becomes downright addicting.  It's like a fast-paced 3d platformer that's also a shooter with the sorts of weaponry I've come to expect from top-down airplane variety shooters, and it actually works pretty well.  It's got N64 era graphics which might disappoint some, but it flows smoothly and they work with the world.  Pretty solid mechanics and enough variety to keep me entertained riiiiight up until some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t escort mission that I can't be arsed to finish, because ♥♥♥♥ escort missions. Still, that first 2/3rds of the game is pretty fun. It'll keep you amused for at least a few hours, longer if you can beat the level that I quit on.  For five bucks, it's definitely recommended.

												Caster is ugly as sin but god damn if using terrain deformation powers to level a mountain and raise another beneath the feet of your enemies, running up an 89 degree wall, and wiping out a gang of dudes with a spirit bomb from a mile in the air isn't the most fun I've had in a while. Get it.			",823,240,35,76,66,10,81
