												A mix between RPG and RTS, this game shines with its immersive adventure quests, yet technical problems spoil the fun.This review was written February 8, 2012. It is based on about 20+ hours in the main campaign, and 20+ hours in the prologue (dead legion DLC). I will update this review when I beat the game if it changes anything.THE GOOD- Text adventures make a welcome come back; they are pretty well done and are the main element that gives KA its flavor and uniqueness.- Voice acting has improved since KA1, at least this voice seems deeper and better at reading the text without rushing it. Sometimes however the voice acting becomes very bad, especially when the same actor tries to voice other characters (women, monsters) while telling a story.- Big improvement on the graphics, especially on the campaign map which is a lot more detailed, believable, and immersive. (Especially in the prologue DLC.)- New spell protection system is a welcome addition, no more having multiple stacks getting decimated in a blink because of one well-placed spell. Addition of a casting delay to spells helps by giving you a chance to react.- New diplomacy system with other factions. It adds some welcome depth to the game.- Pacing seems better than in the original. At least I didn't see any enemy going into an army spawning frenzy, or what the community called the ""whack the mole"" mechanic in the first game.- Estimated play time seems decent. It should take you about 40-50 hours on a challenging difficulty, maybe less if you auto resolve a lot of the battles. There is some replay value since you can do the text quests again with different decisions to see what happens.THE BAD- Horrible performance even on beast machines. I was getting 9-12 FPS on high settings (on a 6 core 3.2gh), and finally managed to get 20-25 with everything on lowest possible. At lowest settings problems surface like being unable to see clearly which units are selected, winter time turns into a white light mess, and so on. This might be a deal breaker for a lot of people.- Loss of the province management aspect. No more management of gold and food incomes. In fact there is no more food in the game, and you only gain gold from quests and battle loot. Other elements like natural disasters (floods, plagues, etc.), and all the laws and decrees are gone too. As a result the whole ""kingdom management"" aspect of the game is mostly gone and reduces the depth of the game.REVIEWKing Arthur makes a comeback, and the result is overall ""good enough"" by being neither great nor bad. The text adventures are still fun as ever, adding a wild card to the gameplay which puts you in a wide variety of situations, and gives a unique flavor to the story telling in this game. The biggest change seems to be the simplification of many aspect of the game, which results in a clear loss of depth and replayability, but at the same time makes the game more accessible to casual players. The first King Arthur was a trinity of battle, management, and text adventures. King Arthur 2 is a duality of battle and text adventure only since the management aspect is mostly gone.Even if regrettable, this change isn't all bad. The campaign seemed to have more ""flow"" to it than in the previous game. You will find yourself passing the turns faster since you don't have to take as many decisions, the game is now more comparable to a relaxing read of a book than a struggle to expand your realm, fight the enemy, and deal with the random events and quest spawning frenzy. In other words, the kingdom management is gone but the game is now a more refined adventure game.Unfortunately some of the more serious technical shortcomings present in the first King Arthur are still present. The random crashes seem to be mostly gone; thankfully I only crashed a couple of times so far. But the extremely low performance and framerate problem is still here. I also found quite a few bugs, like having the narrator reading the wrong text for a quest, campaign map objects flickering, reserve units disappearing, and archer upgrades from buildings affecting their melee damage instead of ranged damage, etc. Also I encountered 2 game stopping bugs myself, and other players reported half a dozen game breaking bugs just days after release.CONCLUSIONYour experience with the game will vary wildly depending on the performance you get. If the game runs well, you will probably enjoy it as it is a very charming game, and even if it has lost some of its depth I feel the game gives enough entertainment value for its pricetag. On the other hand, if you are getting bad to horrible performance, the game will be near unplayable and it might be a deal breaker for you. I highly recommend you try the demo to see how the game runs on your machine. The first KA still gets 12 FPS on my machines after 7 patches, so if history repeats itself as usual a quick fix to the performance problem is not going to happen. However it is worth mentioning that the Neocore team is active on the forums and seems to be working actively on fixing bugs.Of course if you consider yourself a fan of the series, you will probably want to buy the game and play it even with the bad performance and the buggy release. I know a number of people will do this, as I did myself since the game is somewhat playable for me (25fps) on minimal settings.So the bottom line is:1) If you are a fan of the series you will want to buy it and be patient while bugs get fixed.2) If this is your first King Arthur game you might want to wait for a couple of patches or a sale.3) In all cases trying the demo first is highly recommended since the performance issue is probably a big, if not the biggest factor in your purchase decision.

												This game has a great mix of Total war style rts combat WITH PAUSE and RPG elements something like the HOMM series.The Art style is pleasing and the voice actors do a nice job. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic and adds to the immersion. Throw in some text based quests for spice and you have a very satisfying experience. The city management and crafting systems are basic but do have an effect on gameplay. The heroes advancement and marrige systems are interesting. The game is not without flaws, including some graphical glitches especially around flying units. The overall pace is very slow, I have about 300 hours into beating the game twice. All the problems for me were minor compared to the great joy I got from playing this game. Tips: Sell unwanted artifacts to traderDont uprgrade buildings in lands that do not have lordsTake leadership when its offered at leveling up to get the better unitseventually you will get 3 armies so look to upgrade the reserve unit castle capacity in diplomatic exchanges that injur a heroe, you can choose a heroe in the reserve unitsits better to have an ally land than to capture it in most casesRessurect in the righteous line is VERY handy*also, I played this game first, shared from a friends library on steam, so it was free...I loved it and have since purchased it, but I do think that steam and my friend deserve thanks. I never would have played it with the 66 metascore and many poor reviews, but it has become one of my favorite all time games.			",426,169,9,68,57,2,108

												King arthur 2 is a Turn-based Strategy rpg. It takes place (as is obvious from the title) During the mythical time of king arthur and his knights of the round table. This aspect adds alot of fantasy elements into the game and is a nice change of pace from all the historical strategy games on the market today.The story and narration in king arthur are very well done. Quests feel fun to do with multiple ways to complete many of them.The only let down with the questing is that it generally falls into 2 types of quests: text based and combat quests meaning you either have to read tons of text or go to a set area with your army and kill something,Thats all you really do.The fantasy elements come at a high price: Basic human units feel weak and lackluster when compared to high fantasy golems, dragons and shape shifting warriors.Therefore by games end you will have replaced the majority of your army with fantasy units rather than human infantry and archers.The addition of magic into the game adds more depth to the way you fight battles, But sadly magic in both King arthur games feels overpowered to the extreme.It is possible to win battles without ever firing a single arrow or engaging in hand-to-hand combat.The enemy AI in the game also has to capability to decimate your entire army with magic.Lastly heroes in the game are capable of winning entire battles almost single handedly.As a result the rest of your army is reverted to a support role,Taking damage so your hero can close the range to engage with melee or magic attacks.All these things mean that you will be forced to fill your armies with as many overpowered fantasy units as possible. Because you can rest assured that the Ai armies wiil be packed with them. overall unless you find this game on sale i would say avoid it.The game constantly nudges you in the way it wants you to play rather than allowing you free reign to go where you want and attack whoever you want.

												This game had the potential to be amazing. Instead, we were given an untuned and buggy catastrophy. I LOVED the first King Arthur and sunk 100+ hours into it. I had to force myself to finished this game despite the numerous fatal errors and poor graphic performance. In the end the game fails and is not worth the price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Medieval: TOTAL WAR meets Heroes of Might and Magic(s). I have fixed a common FPS problem by ensuring all .exe files in steamapps>common>kingarthurii are marked ""run as administrator."" After solving this issue, running the .exe through Kingarthur's game folder (NOT STEAM), the game runs great! The graphics are an improvement from King Arthur 1, and the campaign-map gameplay has changed significantly. The ambiance is pleasant and the battles challenging (if you want them to be) enough to keep my interest for much longer than anticipated. After 20 hours of gameplay, I have not yet completed the third of four acts, so expect to invest a good (estimated) 30 hours into completing the game.			",72,17,0,17,6,1,37

												To begin with, it is not King Arthur 2, it's rather King Arthur 1.5 or something. It's not completely bad, however I would recommendt it only to fans of the dual strategy genre (turn-based strategic level and realtime battles).Pros:1. It's beautiful, both on the strategy maps (the daylight changes!) and during battles.2. There is an enormous number of units types, particuarly including the expansion.3. It has all the great things from King Arthur 1 and its expansions in one game....Cons:1. ...but nothing more - and in fact, less.2. Where is a proper economy?3. Why can't I create armies when I want to?4. Why the adventures are still a series of dialog choices? (in fact - more limited, as the characters attributes are stripped down)And if you want a challenge, play at a higher difficulty level.			",349,258,4,119,142,4,124

												This is a pretty cool game. The game could have been very enjoyable if the devs decided to actually polish it and fix the thousands of issues that will cause the game to crash for absolutely no reason. It's unplayable, my loading screens give me an error for no reason, whether its after a battle or after trying to load a save it will crash whenever it feels like it. Even moving units makes it spazz out and crash. Im glad i got this for only 6 bucks. I don't know who in their right mind would charge 40 dollars for an unfinished beta of a game.

												The best way to describe this game is how the title describes it, the role playing wargame, that essentially boils down to a Total War game with RPG elements.  Unfortunately the units and battles are not very balanced at all, there is no incentive to having cheaper units as there is no upkeep or economy, so there is no point in not just stacking your armies with the best most expensive units.   The rpg elements in the game are pretty good though.   You essentially start out by choosing a class which gives you a bonus to either leadership, magic, or combat and gives you different spells to learn.  You choose how to level up your character and units by choosing different spells and stats to upgrade.  You then go out and fight armies and complete ""quests"" to gain new items and bonuses.  Your decisions effect your morality (akin to Medieval 2 total war) moving from tyrant to rightful or christian to pagan ruler.  A decent game for strategy/rpg fans but i would wait for a sale to get it.			",193,30,0,41,24,0,52

												As of a couple of hours in I think a few things need to be pointed out for fans of the original. One, archers are no longer the godly force they were in the first game. Second the army strength bar is gone, so if you're enemy is still hiding forces in forests you will have no guess as to how many there are. Third, I am not sure if this is a coding issue, but the game chews a lot of system resources, and my PC isn't slow, but without being on max settings the game glitches if I try to alt+tab, shift-tab or do anything else that involves leaving it. Also the loading times are pretty unpleasant.Otherwise it's the first game all over again with a graphics touch-up, some redesigned features from the first and actual voice-acted RPG sections. Good? Yes. Worth buying right now? Probably not. Wait for some patches or prepare for horrific loading times.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After a certain point, the game becomes buggy and crashes often, and the battles become the same formula over and over. And before you think the total war association means it's good, there is no management at all. You get gold from battles that you then spend on units, no management or province development at all. Overall, fun in the beginning, but boring when you reach the max upgrade on units.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An intresting game, I personally like the first one better in the army mechanics and how you ran your lands, but the story in king arthur 2 is an intresting enough for a play though.  I think the magic works better than in the KA1 and it pretty epic to watch a whole group of spearmen get taken out by a lighting bolt.  So if you see it on sale pick it up.			",170,19,6,26,51,3,43

												To me, this game is like Kings Bounty meets Total War. A turn based strategy map where you move your hero around completing quests but unlike Kings Bounty during fights it switches to a Total War real time combat with armies. Being a fan of both games, i definitely enjoyed King Arthur II. I loved leveling up the various hero units and equiping all manners of artifacts to them. Regular army units can be leveled up and customized in various ways as well. The amount of unit variety and their abilities also made experimenting with different units fairly enjoyable although you could stick with the same standard units and still steamroll the enemies. I also liked the magic shield and spell mechanics in battle. The 'choose your own adventure' RPG quests also allows you to reap different benefits/penalties depending on your choices which is also fun.However, i did find the game somewhat linear and short. Beyond the main quest plots  you really can't deviate that much. Sure you could make evil choices during the RPG portions and become a tryrant but the main quests still remain the same. Enemies or allies are fairly scripted and don't really do much of anything that could alter your strategy. And the controls can be a bit clunky. My biggest annoyance was with the holdings/fiefdoms management. I had to constantly click through many windows to upgrade the buildings and to figure out who was the liegelord of which holdings etc.  Overall i enjoyed the game and i think that if you liked Kings Bounty, you would probably enjoy this game as well.

												 What do you call a game that had amazing potential really nice designs and an awesome story like with good old RPG elements in it that the developers never realised? A sad story, and thats exactly what this game is a sad sad story.  To begin with the positives the gameplay is nice units get some pretty nice upgrades when they level up and you can use a lot of different army compositions in this game. The heroes (or generals) also have some really nice specialities the wizard for example is adept at killing big masses of enemies in a split second or changing the weather in order to stop contain certain types of units from dealing massive damage to his army, the champion is really good in being at the front lines hack and slashing your enemies and providing CC to help the whole of his army maneuver or flank your enemies and last the warlord is...what one would expect, a good old classic general buffing his army and providing support for units while also fighting in the front lines. The units are really interesting, there are a lot of different upgrades for your units to check out and all of them have their uses and you can customise your army in any way you want. So thats all nice right? A rather nice game with interesting gameplay and storyline a few puzzles here and there etc etc. Well yes, untill you realise that some units are just broken some certain builds have by far the strongest units the wizard class is just hands down over powered and you can also bring more generals along if you so desire allowing you to decimate entire armies while keeping your spell shield so strong that the enemy wont be able to cast a single spell appart from a few supportive ones. The cavalry just crushes everything they find in their way with enough momentum and suprise suprise they have a skill that maxes it instantly, monsters are kind of useless (archers and spearmen make short work of them due to the extra damage spearmen have and the damage archers have the ability to rain down on them in combination with wizard heroes in your army monster are just big fat masses of flesh that die before they manage to reach your light infantry which they are expected to take care of), there is absolutely no reason to upgrade any of your castles since you will never fight in them even if the enemy attacks you while you are defending them, you can not create more armies than what the game gives you, for example you get pendragon morgana and lancelot. THE END no more armies even though the game gives you somewhat about 12 more heroes. The strategic map has no value any negotiations with other kingdoms are 100% worthless and overall all there is to do is the quests... Thats it, you do the main quest choices do not matter appart from the ones that give you points towards you religious believes and wether you are considered a tyrant or not and thats it, anything else is compeletely pointless and if you want to do it you do it just for your own personal reasons like roleplay etc. they provide you with almost nothing appart from different looking units and thats it... Over all this game could potentially be a great one it really is a shame because I wanted to see this game becoming great the ideas in it are really nice and fresh, it's just a shame that the developers stopped supporting the game...Lets hope creative assembly makes a good job with their warhammer title.

If you succeed in getting this game to run, you will find yourself treated to a well-designed and original strategy RPG with breathtaking visuals, fun gameplay, and a beautifully presented branching narrative.

												Ignoring bugs and weak combat aspect, this game is leagues above its competition. It introduces mind blowing systems which stupid developers will never think of like ACTUAL MORALITY SYSTEM. It also have highly interactive and immersive campaign map which gives you quality experience far beyond trash like total war warhammer can offer even up to this day. This game is simply too advanced in terms of game design. We have nothing comparable to this game up to the current day and failure of this project is just another proof that gamers do not need quality, just mass produced bland garbage to consume.

												First off, I haven't had any issues with the game crashing, not loading, etc. From what I can tell from other reviews, this game plays similar to the Total Wars series. I can't say since I haven't played them before, but I have played the first King Arthur. This game plays similarly to the first game with a few exceptions. The developpers have tried to make a few balance changes from things that generally seem overpowered in the first game; namely magic, cavalry, and archers. There's now a magic shield that helps prevent your units from getting completely mashed before they even make contact with the other team, along with cast times for most spells. Cavalry now actually gets mashed by spearmen instead of the other way around, but they still pretty much trample everything else. Archers have a much lower starting accuracy, and you can't get skills to prevent decrease in shooting distance to take advantage of combinations such as Storm of Avalon to counter cavalry. Of course, by the end of the campaign, all of these points are moot anyway because units level up to 15 and destroy pretty much everything regardless.The campaign has an interesting story, but runs into the same issues of the first game after a while. Namely that auto-batlle becomes an extremely appealing option regardless if it causes more casualties to prevent the tedium of fighting the same battle over and over again. This is especially an issue since you can only have 3 armies by the end of the campaign, thus giving you little room to vary your tactics.All in all, it's a fun game, especially for the price during sales. I enjoyed the story and the puzzles in the campaign, but should probably have stretched out the game a bit more so battles didn't become a chore.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I emailed the developers and Pardox Interactive pointed me in the direction of the developers (yes, you read that correctly). Unfortunately support@kingarthurthewargame.com forwards to Paradox without their knowledge. So they politely pointed me in the direction of.....you guessed it.... Neocore Support. One month - no reply.So long as this game is and remains broken, I can only recommend that you do not spend your time or money playing what should be and could be a phenomenally enjoyable game.

												If you really want to experience a fantasy version of the tale of King Arthur, this game is a solid take on the classic story. The scenery and animations are gorgeous and hyper-stylized, the story is in depth, and your choices feel like they have actual consequences.That said, the gameplay leaves quite a bit to be desired. The camera will fight you at every opportunity and in many battles is more of a nuissance than the enemies themselves. By about the 1/3 way mark, I ended up fighting every battle on auto-complete which actually ended up giving better results than if I had fought myself. I would recommend it as a pretty solid trip down memory lane with a unique take on King Arthur, but dont expect to be overly entertained by the game otherwise.			",279,45,6,77,32,3,28

												This game is recommended for ppl that loves RPG games, the whole game has an beautiful history, and a cool theme . Have been playing for a while and i can call it a good game , but only if you pay a good price for it. After some hours you just dont care anymore with the quests and story things , you just click the first option that appears and go to a battle, that happens a lot, and often you realize that the previous options wouldn't make a difference after all .The battle is a problem, if you compare the role-play battle mechanics of this game with some other of the same style like Total War etc.. you'll find the game stays behind on that point . Well , just as i said, its worth buying it on a promo or something like that , you will like it and wont regret after all. 7.5/10 :)			",70,9,0,10,15,0,25

												I'm only in chapter I of the game, but what I've seen so far, I liked astonishingly. I'm more of a fantasy fan as strategy fan, and I'm not so much into Total War - don't like too much of strategy map micromanagement. That said, this game is quite right for me: Don't command too many armies at once (1, and I've read later 3 at max) plus a bit of diplomacy and building (s well as Hero/Troop micromanagement) is quite enough for my taste. As a newbie, I messed up my first battle a bit, but since in normal (there would be also casual) difficulty the enemy troops are much weaker than comparable troops of mine, after that battles seemed too easy. I didn't experience performance issues or bugs yet and played at ""graphics: very high"" @ dual core 3,2 GHz and Radeon R 7 200 series - no high-end machine.  Update starting Chapter III: I still like the game - plus still no bugs -, but the whole story seems a bit less imaginative and creative than King Arthur I. Still recommend this, liked KA1 more though. Apart from some enemy armies (e.g. one army with many flying units, which I have to adapt to), battles are still very easy in normal. Micromanagement is a bit too much, but luckily much is not really necessary to do if you don't want to.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												King Arthur II is basically the same game as the first except there are ton of new units. A ton of new choices, epic new fights and an improvement in literally every aspect of the game save two.The first one is building.In the first one, you got one city where you would build all your upgrades. In this game, you have multiple ""villages"" or ""forges"" scattered around everywhere. An enemy can walk over one and grab it easily because you can only have up to three armies and that's at the very end of the game. Nothing is centralized and it just makes you do a lot of extra button clicks to do the same thing.The second part is story:The Story is VERY forcefully linear. You can't attack or use diplomacy with neighbors until you enter a certain part of the story and by that time. Your own empire is so huge they are almost no consequence. You don't have a single challenge outside of one fight which is just stupid because of the restrictions they added to it.If you like that building style and story method. By all means, buy this game but otherwise, I'd just replay the first one.			",152,21,0,30,23,0,52

												ok so having had problems to start and after airhead techies from paradox who did not know what to do, i figured out and fixed my own problems, afterwhich i have enjoyed playing the game (as long as it worked properly).NOTE:-lowering graphics can help-making sure it is searching for a graphics card you catually have (for some reason it looked for one i did not have)-don't mess with the raw code if you don't know what you are doing.    -if you do know what you are doing changing thie number of bites it takes to run can also helpif you exit mid battle it will shift all your text axises from your last save on, to fix: manually fight the battle with the messed up axis and save after battle. then restart whole game.yes there are bug and man that can get annoying, but i have yet to play the truly PERFECT game, and so the flow was nice the strategy was fun and playing from random points forward.  all having been said i liked the ability to have better control over resources and armies in the first king arthur, i likes the shards, crafting recipies, building upgrades, and the story, and story quests were easier to follow logically, and  know what to do. though a hint about not getting a second army until i complete Morgana's quest would have been nice.  a truly good mix between RPG, Turn-based, and RTS each played a part, but to win you need to be decent at RTS.if you are looking for an in depth story-line from both main quest and prologue then this is the game to have, but remember there will be bugs to deal with, and in order to stay sane you'll have to stay patient.

												This review is about King Arthur II:The Role playing Wargame but in the current Steam deal  other Arthurian games are included and they seem pretty good as well, just older..First up the game looks pretty good,runs fine in Windows 7 64 bit,it even manages to look,I think,like Britain.Nah I don't mean its raining all the time and the M25 wagon track is gridlocked yet again  I mean the green and pleasant land aspects of Britain.Battles are fine, lots of units, control is ok I would like to get in a bit closer but can not unfortuneatly,might be me,  but the usual Total War tricks don't get you at some footmans armoured shoulder. Never mind. Also may not be the best game for the  seriously paranoid as your magic seems pretty damned feeble  but what the AI is zapping you with is whamo straight off the main  grid.Music fine, voice acting ok,role play seems to be choose between ending up a really nice guy or a complete card carrying  prat and the only bug I have encountered so far is that start and end the game will lock up  promptly if you don't move your mouse.Other than that this is lots of pretty good wargamery for not much cash with the current deal. Check it out.....			",65,11,0,19,31,0,46

												Sadly, there were too many bugs for me to enjoy King Arthur 2.I really liked the presentation. (The artwork was outstanding. Really, very fun.)I really liked the idea of playing in this magical, medieval world.I liked most of the combat.I didn't like how the cities were managed, but I dealt with that.I didn't like how I could only control one or two armies (maybe later there will be more, I don't know), but I suffered through that.I didn't like how players were herded towards attacking certain territories instead of where they wanted, but I went along with it, because I knew the developers were trying to tell a linear story.However, the few quest-breaking bugs (such as the game sometimes being unable to handle it when the AI attacks you two times in a row during the same turn), a few poor design decisions (such as allowing heavy cavalry to charge in dense forest during combat phases), and random crashes destroyed the experience for me.I tried. I played for nearly forty hours and got to the point in the story where Arthur is closing the Roman gates.But, after refighting one of those ""invincible"" armies and having the game bug on me, because I didn't close a window in time for the AI to attack my other army... nope, done.If the next game can get rid of these issues, I'm sure I'll buy it, but I'm done with this one.

												I bought the game this couple of years ago and was last I played it. I love the stories of King Arthur and his knights and I absolutely loved the first the game because I made a good effort to stay on the true narrative. Although this one haves a lots of problems.Pros I liked the prologue chapter on the Romans. ConsThe flying creatures are truly unfairRemoving Arthur from the game was a dumb choice, basically it all about his sonThe two other heroes: Lancelot and Morgana le Fey are both negative characters in the Arthurian legends. Why not sir Gawain, or PercivalWhy is Sir Galahad Evil? Galahad should be dead and burred in the holy land after the grail quest. Merlin is alive? If so why can't he be a playable hero?To get dragons, giants, arch angels, or Faerie warriors is not easy to acquire even after you have the right morality position because they you need X amount of command points.Cities and building is pointlessExtremely buggyNot a well thought out storyIn conclusion don’t buy this game, I would recommend if instead you are interested in the subject is to buy a book on the Arthurian legends (It’s cheaper and better).

Many other small thing like no settlement controll, only gain gold from battle and loot.Well I hade my hopes up and it didn't live up to my hopes, if your not a total war fan you might like it			",22,16,0,38,4,2,22

												*Minor Spoiler Alert!*This game is fantastic, with varying diffuculty levels allowing vast sweeping battles for the Casual Player who just wants to give some orders and then watch as his units slaughter the enemy, and extremely difficult random battles that will test your resolve and your will to survive the fall of Rome in one of her most far flung colonies. A deep and intriquing story with many choices along the way, ultimately leading to the foregone conclusion - Rome is dead, you are a ghost of rotting empire, and you are no Hero.8/10Would Commit Heresy in the name of preserving the Light of Civilization again.

												The story plot holds you back to much forcing you to do it. No freedom what so ever. Play Total War if you like freedom to do anything and pick any faction you want. If you want to be shacked down doing nothing but the story plot in Total War style. This is a game for you. I have uninstalled it cause the story hurt the game play to much.			",231,49,1,70,49,2,59

												When it comes to the subject of King Arthur I can’t help but be intrigued by it. Nor am I the only one. There are plenty of books, movies, and a few video games that attest to how popular the Once and Future King is. In King Arthur: The Role-Playing Wargame, I took part in his rise to power but the sequel does not continue on in a positive manner.In King Arthur II: The Role-playing Wargame, the golden age of Arthur is no more. Known as the Maimed King due to a magical wound, Arthur and his kingdom suffer together. Monsters roam the torn kingdom, the Knights of the Round Table have disappeared and a new threat looms on the horizon. Now it is up to William Pendragon, son of Arthur, to find a cure for his father and restore the land.This is the setting in which I found myself.Read the rest of the review at Press2Reset: http://press2reset.com/reviews/review-king-arthur-ii-the-role-playing-wargame/ ",344,72,5,59,47,3,79

												KA2-TRPWbuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuugo and see my review of the first one cause its like this same!so king arthur  2 takes place in time after all legends of King arthur ends. sounds awesome? its is awseome you are king arthurs son and you will have to fight of fomorians, humans, more fomorians, and more humans. but ok let me say whats what is bad in the gamescripting and game mechanics- buuuuuuuuuuuuuu they are just ruining the game! land battles didnt change from KA 1 ( and thanks god cause if they would try, they would be even worse)  campaign map is heavy storie driven... to heavy storie driven- in first KA it was like more total war expirience- here its just su***! and since everything depends on campaign map mechanic everything suffers from it. so yeah... mechanics and scripting bad...whats good?damn everything else is good! and its even better than in the KA 1 ! pre play- you could play a pre play of KA2  where you was roman commander who stationed in britan- you know in britan where is magic!- and storie of it was gooooooooooooood, was so goooooood that you ended up us a evil emperor of hadrian wall with ghost legioners at your command. AWESOME and KA 2 take places after those events. and you fight the Emperor !storie- is AWESOME, now every quest is voiced, and you as a protagonist have to work with morgana le fay and lancelot to restore the kingdom. (its not like lancelot is acused of wounding king arthur. and morgana well... we all now who morgana was ). if you liked storie in KA 1 you will like the storie of KA 2atmosphere and designe - its better than it was and even the troops variety is biger:) but thanks to new leveling system of troops ots totaly ruined. new feature- new buildings- new diplomacy mechanics- new artifacts and posibility of creating your own artifacs. just yeah!so what can be said about KA2? you should play the first one in the first place. secendly you have to be open minded for evrething it comes here. and you have to find this inner strenght ( and cheats , and easy mod) just to play game for the stories, and be blind for the games broken mechanics. i would rate this game like 3/10 dor its mechanics and 9/10 for storie ( cant just give 10/10 for stories cause stories are affected by game mechanic and cause of that some of them are yrg...). so like  5 /10 for the whole?

												This game isn't quite sure what it is.  RPG and wargame...  It tries to be similar to the Total War franchise in regards to its combat.  Unfortunately, a number of the units are unbalanced, and so the combat can take a lot longer than it should.  It adds spells, which I found to be an annoyance, as my archers were always literal lightning rods.The overarching strategy seemed deficient as well, as there aren't many ways to get gold so tech, infrastructure and army all suffer.  It also limits the number of armies that you can have roaming around, so wandering armies just take over buildings of mine, which admittedly didn't seem to affect me at all.As far as the RPG factor goes, it again struggles.  For some reason the player is fighting Irish demons.  You don't get to see or use King Arthur, and end up killing multiple knights of the round table.  Other knights don't even appear, which would be understandable for most, but they cut out Gawain, and left in Agravain?  A lot of the leveling really didn't feel like it mattered for heroes.Overall, depending on what you want there are games which do what this game does, only much better.  I can't recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Biggest fault with this game is that it tries to do to much things. It has elements of :Total War Style Map and Battle system, Old school Text RPGS, puzzle adventure, inspirations is also taken from Heroes of Might n Magic when it comes to hero progression.That is just a start, you will find you jumping between typs of game play often, it does most thing pretty well and some things like the Hero progression and story telling it does a good jobb.As a fan of RPGs and the strategy games, I really enjoyed this game and is under rated, because you need to like many types of games to enjoy this because it incapsulate all of them.Finaly I would say that you grab it if it sounds intresting but if you have any dubt grab it on a sale, still at of now it is 10€ on steam which is cheap for about 15 hours plus of gameplay.

												Very good mix of the role-playing aspects of the game and the Wargaming aspect of it. Story was relatively solid, but the ending was anticlimactic. Noticed a few graphical glitches toward the end as corpses that are around the battlefield can get stretched out and if enough of them do it then the frame-rate bombs. Character and Unit designs are amazing, even if they do recycle some models with a different skin or effect. All in all, however the game is very good, even if it doesn't break new ground. I'd give it a 7.5/10			",29,1,0,7,2,0,7

												WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ IS THIS...This is not King Arthur....  It's like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-son of King Arhtur Role Playing War Game....Oh my god...On rails.  And the first battle I was so confused and didn't know what the hell was going on...BAD.  BAD BAD BAD.And I love all the other games this company made like Crusaders Thy Kingdom Come and King Arthur 1.This is a classic example of DO NOT CHANGE AND DEVIATE FROM WHAT WORKS SO WELL!!!   OMG this is bad.  People are not kidding and I wanted to give this game a really good shot but it deters you from very early.  I wanted this to be good.Not like the first one.Which the first King Arthur was so perfect... I don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ this is.... ",8,0,0,0,0,0,1

												This game is a mix of RTS gameplay (similar to the Total War series) and roleplaying elements. You have a campaign map that echoes the Total War series and the battles that unfold are very similiar in control and style as well. This game is like total war with a fantasy setting and some text based role playing added in for good measure.King Arthur II is far from perfect, but it's well worth it if on sale or in a bundle.

												I bought this long before there was the user review option on steam. From what I remember, I guess this game would be great if you enjoy boring stories, mediocre role play, overall chees \y battle mechanics that feel like a bootleg of a total war game, that universally make history irrelevant, the legend of king arthur confusing to understand, and ultimately dissapointing gameplay.  What a shame, i'd like to think the developers put a lot of work into this game, but i guess this game came along well before any developer could realize that, thanks to steams user review, that there will always be medicorce results for a mediocre product. I give it a    poop/10			",151,14,1,25,37,2,38

												Critically praised by reviewers and gamers alike, King Arthur was received as one of the biggest surprises to emerge on the gaming scene in 2010. Now the Fantasy/Roleplaying RTS returns in a sequel set to push the boundaries of the genre even further.Our story begins long after young Arthur pulled the enchanted sword out of the stone, united the war-torn land of Britannia, gathered the Knights of the Round Table and secured peace in Camelot aided by the might of the Holy Grail. Where legends normally end, King Arthur II begins on its own gruesome tale...			",1115,462,53,160,159,14,251
