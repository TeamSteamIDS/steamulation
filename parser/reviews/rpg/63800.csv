												I gave this game a shot, I really did. I wanted to like it, and even with it's obvious, glaring flaws, I dug deeper to see if there was something there, but after it was all said and done, there wasn't.The game presents an interesting idea, and it reminded me of something like Dungeon Keeper. You have dwarves, and you have them mine these caves for you in real-time, collecting resources, which you use to attack the other team. You can find treasures, and different items that give you temporary upgrades for that match, and eventually, one team becomes the victor.Sound great, right? Well, no, actually.On paper, the game sounds like it'd be cool, and really fun, but in practice, the controls are just awful. You're forced to move the camera around by clicking and dragging, and issuing commands to your units just feels really cumbersome. The artstyle is interesting for a bit, but once you realize how limited the whole thing is, and how many assets they changed the colors on and re-used. that also begins to lose it's appeal. There is basically no storyline to speak of, and what little bit of flavor text they do try to put in there just comes off as bland and annoying.I could forgive ALL of these things if the design of the game was fun... but it also fails in that aspect. Nothing I did in the game felt rewarding or satisfying, and I think that's the most damning thing you can say about it. It just feels like a bunch of cumbersome clicking without any payoff. It's a bland, useless, mess of a game, and nobody should waste their time or money with it.			",558,151,13,49,35,7,75

												Delve Deeper is a game about dwarven greed. But mostly TREASURE! Go down there and grab as much as you can for your most exhalted king. And more importantly, get more than the other teams!You'll go in with five(5) dwarves, and will need to collect as much loot as you can in games that seem to go by pretty quickly. It's a good game to start up when you're bored or don't know what else to play, or just because you want to grab some more of that sweet gold.Of your team, you can select 3 classes. The slow, powerful fighters. Fast, but slightly weak scouts, and miners who are a bit average at everything but can haul the most loot. Of course, being dwarves, all classes can mine gold, gems and mithril and carry chests of loot out, but some can carry more than others, and some fight better than others. And since you are trying to prove you are more loyal to your king and better at extracting riches, you may end up fighting the other dwarven teams as well. It's a simple game with solid mechanics, where you start your turn with a tunnel piece you can put down somewhere to expand your tunnels, or to unleash a massive horde of goblins into your opponent's tunnels. After that, you move your dwarves and end your turn. After that you fight with whichever dwarves are in tiles with enemies on them. A simple and easy to learn system with plenty of maps and plenty of replayability. And on top of that, it's cheap tooWorth grabbing whenever you have some cash left over for it. It's cheap, amusing to play, has plenty of replayability(So long as you don't play it all the time) and a most worthy king to deliver all your gold to who occasionally comments on things going on in his own special kind of way.

												Delve Deeper is a local 1-4 player game where you play against each other to try to get the most treasure. At the beginning of the game, you choose from 4 different coloured dwarf mining teams (red, blue, green, yellow), each consisting of 5 dwarfs.  There are 3 different ""classes"" of dwarf, these being miner, scout, and fighter. Each class differs in fighting ability and the number of tiles they can move in each turn. At the start of your turn, you can choose a tile from the right side which basically causes one area of the map to be auto-mined, creating a tunnel. Once the tile has been placed, you can move some or all of your dwarfs, having them pick up treasure, mine for gold, and fight monsters or other dwarves. When a dwarf's inventory is full, you direct them to go back to base to off load their treasure. Rinse and repeat until the game is finished.This is a very simple game, and it's actually pretty fun. Until it crashes. And it crashes a lot. In fact, looking at the forums and other reviews, it seems that this bug has been in the game from the very beginning and in two years since the game's release on Steam, the developers still haven't fixed it. Until this bug is fixed, I can not recommend this game.			",515,368,32,109,89,3,137

												Fun little game, though without much DEPTH to it. I'd still say I rather DIG this game, despite some of its FAULTS. Like, say, no saving feature when a single game can last for over an hour so it can be TUFF to finish it in one sitting if you lack the time, and it eventually gets a little BORING. DD's devs have been STONE silent for a while though so don't expect any bug fixes or new content, however the free DLC is still quite a GNEISS addition. But you just gotta admit that this little game is just a STEPPING STONE towards something greater.Speaking of which.A sequel with multiplayer included is currently in the works, as far as I'm aware, but devs are taking their sweet time with it, and as for the ETA for its release... Well, your guess is as good as MINE.I'm done.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Interesting board game.Players take turns digging into the field by placing tunnel pieces and then sending their dwarves down to collect as much treasure as possible. Your dwarves can mine for treasure, but that takes time. Larger caches of treasure can be found by killing monsters wandering around the board, although this involves fighting and is much more risky depending on your team makeup. Artifacts are a form of treasure that can have a wide variety of effects, good or ill, and make the game more exciting. The game ends after a certain amount of turns, where the player with the most treasure wins.It can be quite fun, but for god's sake find a friend to play this with. That is essentially the whole point of a board game, really. And to all of you who bat your eyes at my calling this a board game: you could conceivably convert this to physical form very easily, with a human dungeon master taking the place of the monster AI.I don't know why all these other reviewers want this game to be something it clearly wasn't supposed to be. I mean, how hard can it be to talk about this game in the way it was designed to be played?			",226,22,1,46,8,3,56

												Very amusing game best suited for a causal play during a lul at a small party. Playing solo more than three or four times will pretty much end most of the interest in the game for you - so I strongly suggest hooking this up to your TV and passing the controller around.Drinking rules encouraged.The other reviews, I think, want this game to be more than it is. But it's a short, fun, game that doesn't take itself too seriously or try to be a time sink. And you know what, it's ok for a game to be that (especially with the quality put into this one.)

												Delve Deeper is a funny and interesting strategy game. You send gangs of dwarves deep into the mountain to gather riches for their king, and whoever finds the most is the winner. The game has many smart strategic elements, but lacks depth and content to be anything but an amusing interlude between greater strategy games.The retro aesthetic really works well for this type of experience. There's a nice attention to detail in the sprite work. That said, the art style isn't as consistent as I would have liked. The backgrounds, text, and some elements of the HUD don't quite fit in line with the throwback vibe.The biggest issues I had with Delve Deeper, however, was the camera and tile placement. Simply put, the camera is erratic. As for the tile placement system, it's overly complicated.Delve Deeper is one of those flawed, but much-loved gems. Lunar Giant was wise to set the game at such a low-risk price; you can get quite a lot out of it, if you are willing to put up with some minor to not-so-minor annoyances. When you get into a groove with this game, time slips past you.Overall 7/10.			",2266,868,87,236,310,22,349

			here is the review for this game on steam http://steamcommunity.com/id/blinkdoggie/recommended/63800		

this is like a turn based board gameyou play as 1 of up to 4 dwarven teams venturing into a mine full of monsters and loot.you have 5 dwarves of 3 classes (fighters-slow but hit hard, miners-can carry more and hit ok, scouts-fast but week).each turn you can dig out 1 space then you move your dwarves.they can grab from piles of loot or artifacts (you can only carry one and when you turn it in it has a random value) without stopping but will need to end a turn in front of a deposit to take 1 chunk of ore or gems from it.you need to take all loot back to your base or find a bank for it to count.if you run into an opposing dwarf or any dungeon critters you'll have to stop and attack them.you win by having the most loot at the end of all the turns.not everything in the depths want to kill you, here are some things that will help you out.gnomes - these guys will collect ore & gems for a small cut of the take.beholders - they will turn in artifacts for you.fairies - if you start your turn on one of these fields you'll be healed to full health.

												Delve Deeper is a simple turn based strategic game.The tutorial in the game is a big dialogue that goes into detail of what the game gives (building tunnels to selecting a dwarf and point it to a tunnel where he can mine gold).The game resolve where you can play from 2  to 4 players and the game is decided by how much gold you have earned through mining gold, gem, mithril, loot from defeating monsters/players and relics.(To play multiplayer. You need to play it on the computer the game is on. Meaning you can't play from over the world. (Which is actually a must for a game like this)).Before you start you can choose to three classes:- Miner:This class can hold up to 6 items for gold, gem and mithril. Can walk 4 steps and is overall the points getter in the game.- FighterThis class can hold up to 4 items for gold, gem and mithril. Can only walk 3 steps and is overall the one who protect and fight- ScoutThis class can only hold up to 3 items for gold, gem and mithril. Can walk 6 steps and is overall the one to kill weak monsters and light tunnels that is farther away.The relics in this game make said classes stronger, but said relic will only have effect on the said dwarf who picked said relic up.Relics can be turned in at bazaars or the camp (where you start) and might give favourable effects that will last the whole game.(Relics also have some references to pop culture, Dwarf Side of the Moon as an example).The enemies in the game (monsters/players) make the game a little more strategic as well with building tunnels.Building tunnels is optional. you can use it to progress deeper in the mine or give an opening for monsters to attack other players. Making the gameplay a little more fun. Tunnels is at first dark, but everytime you or the other player/computer goes to a dark tunnel. the dwarf will light the tunnel up preventing spawning for more monsters.Every map have it's set amount of rounds that varies. (creating a map will automatically give an amount of rounds).making your own map is at first a great feature. Only that you need every hex to be filled to make it truelly playable.Picking out tunnels without showing what pieces you can select (picking a wrong piece meaning you need to click said hex to redo it). You will be taking a lot of time to create a map. since it's a lot of trial and errors.Overall it's a solid game and maybe a must for all strategic gamers out there.But for me I can't recommend this game.Pros:- Easy, Fun Gameplay- Strategic to it's coreCons:- Slow Gameplay- Creating a map is (kinda) frustrating- Multiplayer is local-onlyFeedback for this review is appreciated.

												This is a fun little stategy-turn based game where you compete with other dwarves to dig tunnels and the mechanic for digging the tunnels is interesting. It can lead to you creating a path from the monsters to your enemy's miners, beating his men down so they spend more time fighting and less time mining. I often find myself getting sucked in and lost in it as it's quite addictive and worth a buy if you are looking for a time wasting oppitunity, but there's nothing really amazing to consider it a must buy, by any streach of the imagination.

												Delve Deeper was a little confusing at first, but after spending an hour learning the ropes, I found the game does offer some mild fun. It's a short turn-based strategy game where you and up to three other players control a team of dwarfs and compete against one another in search for the most treasure. There's a handful of different treasure types that are worth different points plus collectible relics which can modify your team member's stats. Each game is played for a finite amount of turns (usually between 10 and 30) and the player with the most points after all turns are played wins. Nothing over the top--just short and simple. It's a very similar game style to Worms.There are three classes of dwarfs each having different stats like hit points, movement points, and inventory slots which you choose before the match. Each team starts at a different mining location allowing you to decide whether to battle your opponents and take their stuff or avoid them and just mine for gold. There is also an evil team which is computer controlled made up of various monsters throughout the dungeon to thwart your treasure collecting efforts. The old school battle system works pretty well with the rest of the game's simplicity.Now there are a couple game breaking bugs that you'll need to avoid otherwise the game will just crash. When you are on an invalid dig location and click on the yellow area where it says ""No Valid Plays"", the game will crash. Very repeatable and very annoying, but if you don't click on the yellow area, the game seems to be stable. Also you'll want to turn off the tutorial, otherwise the game randomly locks up during some battle sequences. I found a few forum posts about these plus claims that the developers have moved on to a sequel so there likely won't be any future fixes.If you can work around these bugs, the game isn't bad. I can't really recommend a game with major lingering bugs, but there is a decent amount of replayability for fun in small doses.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												I enjoy the game, and could easily sink endless hours into it.  It's like a really complex board game where you collect treasure by mining, fighting monsters, and competing with other dwarven mining teams. However, there's a a fatal defect where the game crashes to the desktop basically at random. That, coupled with the inability to save (or autosave), means that I'm unable to complete a game. Tried different remedies suggested by the developers to no avail. I want to love it and recommend it, but any game with this severe of a defect 1.5 years after release is awful.

It's a turn based game and I haven't been able to get past a second turn without the game crashing.It's a known issue, you can read about it in the forums, look for all the posts about the ""invalid tile bug"".  It seems that it's been known and unpatched since at least November 2012.There are no saves or checkpoints, so if you do want to try again after the game crashed, you have to start over from the beginning every time.

When multi is only you with botsDelve Deeper is a tactical-management game where you are a dwarf in campaign to be the best miner, your objectif like all dwarves (it seems) is to collect as much gold as possible. But there is a problem, multiple problems, the mine is infested by creatures and there are other dwarves interested by your gold & gems.Delve Deeper could have been a small fun game to play with friends when you are bored of big AAA games but the problem is Delve Deeper accept multiplayer games ONLY IN LOCAL (and the game costs 5€ which is expensive to play it 3 times)! So if you are bored to start an hamachi room (and explain to your 1/2/3 friends how to do it) you are s*****!Sorry Delve Deeper, but a multiplayer game only in local in 21st century, it's not possible.You can play it against computer, but is it really interesting?Gameplay: 3/10Graphics: 5/10 (because there are nice old school RPG monsters)Music: 4/10Story: -/10 ",230,102,2,34,23,3,33

												I have to give Delve Deeper a thumbs up. It's basically a board game, and requires board game thinking: cards and pieces and everything. You move around and get gold, count your spaces, open up parts of the area strategically to make you earn more or screw with other players. I played this a while ago and was addicted for a while until that computer died, and I then loaded it up recently to find it still holds up. I got the base game and the DLC because it was so cheap and because I saw the graphics for the characters released free on Open Game Art. I don't understand the low ranking here at all, unless it was the Delver game people lured into a fight about the name after this had already been out. The only bad thing about the game is sometimes waiting for the computer characters to move, but I see now there's a setting for that, so it's my own fault. If you go into this thinking it's going to be an RPG you will be disappointed, sure, but that would be stupid seeing as how there's all the preview stuff available before you buy. If this looks like your type of game, get it. If you want a 3D soldier game with fantasy trappings I'm sure you can find one of those on here instead, and you should.			",419,224,5,80,65,5,106

												The most boring game ever created? May be.Crawl through boring tunnels for no purpose other than to get more points than the other guy. Combat is dull, moving characters is slow and getting anywhere takes forever, which is made even worse by the fact you have to make repeated trips to the surface to turn in your loot. Everything just happens at a snails pace, yet there is little strategy involved to offset this methodical pace. Only 5 bucks so it's got that going for it, but really, better off saving the money. I dont hate this game, but it dont cost that much.			",109,9,3,4,1,1,1

												Delve Deeper is a game which on the surface seems cute and innocent.  However, below the exterior is a game which is deceptively difficult and unendingly fun.Is the ultimate goal is to make more money for your king than the other team.  You will need to excavate tunnels in order to get at the wealth which is hidden from view.  Where will you dig your tunnels, and what strategy will you use when placing them in order to find the greatest amount of wealth?There are all manner of nasty things down there which are just waiting to be released so that they can attack your Miners.  Usually they guard large amounts of wealth or the entryways two areas which you need in order to be able to, of course, delve deeper which is where the best of the loot is to be found.  The questions here are, do you risk the attack, and if you do, how many of your Miners will you commit to the battle?  Your Miners can't be killed, but they can get beat up so badly that they will miss the next turn.  That can end up in the cycle where your miner is being killed every turn and therefore cannot mine or escape on tell a group of his compatriots com to his rescue and defeat the monster.  In this instance your Miners are spending their time rescuing, and not mining, whilst your competitor is merrily running up the score in his favour.Then there are chests.  Chests are gamble.  They can give you a huge advantage, give you a huge disadvantage, attack you (because they aren't really chests but rather monsters in disguise), or they can be worthless old tat.  Will you risk picking it up?  If it doesn't attack, you will need to carry it some distance to turn it in either at the surface or at a turn in location which you have discovered somewhere in your mine.There is much more to this game than what I have discussed thus far, but hopefully this will give you some feeling for the complexities as you play this game and plan your strategies.  As I stated in the beginning, it is deceptive, and there is much more to it than immediately meets the eye.  If you buy this game (an excellent value for money at the usual price and even better when it's on sale) then I wish you many hours of fun just as I have had, delving deeper!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First impressions (trailers/screens) suggested a fairly interesting and new take on dungeon exploration with turn-based strategy elements. Unfortunately the game falls short of its potential with very long games (due to AI turns), no option to save and resume, frequent crashes, and not much variety in terms of gameplay. Overall an ok time killer and a decent casual game on lower difficulty settings. Can see it being fun in local coop if you're up for some board-game shenanigans with friends.

												This game is mediocre, I got it for $1.48 in a winter sale with trading card market money and barely regret it.   The console controller support is very buggy, sometimes you'll be in the middle of moving a dwarf and the game will just minimize to desktop, and other times it will just crash to desktop with no error.  At the match resolution screen you have to switch to mouse & keyboard to get back to the main menu and then the console controller with not be accessible or detected by the game until you reload it.No save feature exists mid-match, so if the game crashes say goodbye to the last 20-60 minutes of your life. Trying to complete achievements because 100% achievement completion is your thing, this might not be the game for you until at least save feature or the crash to desktop bugs are addressed.Beware opening tunnels aggressively on computer opponents so that they are swarmed and attacked by 20+ monsters, turn rotation begins to take forever because each one moves individually  to each hex when it's occupied by a dwarf they are going to attack instead of collectively based on their movement #, or by monster type.  They each attack individually on their invisible initiative count.  Although hilarious to win by having your opponents torn to bits it makes a 20 turn match take 2-3 times longer.  I couldn't imagine playing a 40 turn match without being able to save.			",141,19,0,41,9,0,11

												I would normally not give a review to a mediocre game but given that it's cheap, original and underrated it's well worth this short review.Never before have I seen a turn based strategy game that is so different to the meta of turn based strategy games. If you enjoy turn based games and looking for something new, this is for you.This game lacks content and will only obtain your attention for a few hours at best but given that it has controller support and couch multiplayer it's a neat game to play with friends every now and then.Sure there are better games, but you won't find any game that tries to experiment with new ideas as this game has. Kudos to the developers.			",168,27,3,16,11,0,16

												The most important thing to remember is this is a hotseat multiplayer game. VS the AI you'll just get bored after a while and there's no online multiplayer.Delve deeper is a light strategy game that combines area control, pressing your luck, and dwarves. There's a lot of randomness with the battles, which generally punishes over expansion. This is a board game in many ways before the whole video game board game thing became cool. There are plenty of maps included, as well as an editor, you're unlilkely to get bored of a specific map before the gameplay. I can't offer better praise than I am still playing this 5 years later and enjoying it. It shows it's age in a clunky UI, but the balance of risk vs reward is seldomly so enjoyably fine tuned. Just be careful for your jerk friend waiting for you to be weakend before swooping in with thier 5 scouts to pick up your hard won mithril. ",59,24,0,30,32,1,32

												The page on this includes RPG and adventure in the description, but don't be fooled -- it's purely turn-based strategy.  You play on a variety of 2d side scrolling maps which each have a set number of turns for you to find and return the most loot for the dwarf king.  Maps are grid-based and you get to dig one grid deeper each turn.  You play as a team of five dwaves taking turns against 1-3 other teams.  You can choose a combination of scouts, miners and fighters to compose your team.  They all have different pros and cons: miners can carry more loot, but are weak to enemies and other players; scouts can move more grid spaces each turn, but are also weak; fighters can take down enemies but move fewer spaces and carry less.  Loot is either mined, dropped off slain enemies/players or found as artifacts laying around.  You must use a turn to deposit them at certain grids on the map before they count toward your score.Plenty of achievements, settings, looks nice and is fun.			",2958,1175,116,358,419,33,494

												You know, for a turn based game, this has potential. I love the classic resource gathering games, and this is a very simple game that is all about that. The thing that changes this game is that to get better resource, you need to 'Delve Deeper' and dig the deeper areas of the map. The deeper you are, the better resources you get. Beware however, the deeper you are, the bigger the monsters get!You control where the flow of the game goes as you control the tunnel systems and choose where to build and dig. This can get quite fun because you can link the other teams tunnel to a tunnel that has a Dragon in it.. and its always fun to watch your enemies get eaten by Dragons. The flaws of this game are there is no online multiplayer whatsoever, and no LAN multiplayer either. I guess it still is 'multiplayer' but everyone playing would have to play from the same computer. Another flaw to this game is its time per turn. It takes a long time to move each of your characters around the map and then have to wait for your enemies turns. It gets a bit annoying, but this is the price to pay for a turn based game. I dont think that the price for this game is justified for the content. Realistically, this game should cost under $1 as it is very small. I dont see much change between multiple matches, and the lack of multiplayer really brings this game down. It does has merit and potential. I'd have to give this game 5/10. Just enough to say give it a shot, but not for over $5.00			",75,7,2,12,7,0,4

												The premise is simple. You build a team of dwarves that dig, collect and fight in a mine to collect the most treasure at the end of a certain number of rounds. You play against other teams of AI or local co-op if you can find someone else who wants to play this game. For the most part it's a strategy game with some RPG elements. Other than directing your team where to mine you don't have much control other than that. The fighting parts are played completely by the AI. There are difficulty settings you can adjust but for the most part the other dwarf teams will just try and mine more than you and the random monsters will attack the closest group to them. Another thing about the monsters is that some are also randomly generated during the match. So while you might only see 4 or 5 near you during their turn can quickly spawn an extra 10. This is annoying as you're pretty much screwed when you only have a team of 5 at most and if they aren't 5 fighters you will die rather quick and the monsters will just attack you again the moment you get back up.Ironically the only reason you'd want to play this game is to mine achievements. There's plenty to be had some harder to achieve than others. There's a good variety of maps and even the option to create your own. This game has potential to be very good but overall an average party mining game but low on the list of games I'd want to play with others.			",461,286,7,85,41,7,68

												Delve Deeper is a very boardgamey game that has some potential, but a lot of small annoyances. The interface lacks feedback, there are no tooltips of any kind (for monsters or for other players' dwarves) and some game mechanics are questionable at best. (Oh, there was a pile of gold hidden behind that dwarf who was carrying nothing? Well, let's not pick that up.) Just to name a few.It is by no means a bad game and you should probably pick it up when it's on sale but I can't bring myself to recommend it either. ",324,67,8,41,39,4,69

												Delve Deeper is a light, entertaining turn-based strategy game in which each player commands a team of five dwarves in a race to gather as much gold and jewels as possible within the time limit. The rules are simple and straightforward, and the experience feels a lot like a board game as it plays out. Each turn, you will place a new section of tunnel, move each of your dwarves, and then watch as they fight monsters and gather treasure. Battles are basic RPG fare, and are handled automatically. The strategy elements come into play as you decide how to task your dwarves. Each dwarf can only hold a fixed amount of treasure, which must be returned to your base camp (or to a gnomish bank, for a fee) in order to be added to your score. There are also special relics which can be collected; these remain a mystery until they are turned in at camp, at which time they may give you a large boost in your treasure, provide the dwarf who was carrying it a boost to life, attack power, or speed, or even *subtract* points from your score in the case of cursed items.Strategic placement of tunnels is also important. The layouts of tunnels that may be placed become more restricted as you move from the highest 'dirt' level down through the 'stone' layer and into the 'deep'. If placing tiles carelessly, you might find yourself unable to reach a treasure-laden tunnel in the future. You also have the option of connecting monster-filled tunnels to your opponent's tunnel system in order to distract and delay them.I played several games of Delve Deeper against the CPU, each of which took 45-60 minutes to play out. I didn't see any way to save my progress during a game; all of the games I played were completed in a single session, but the lack of saving did discourage me from trying some of the larger maps.Positives:* Quick and easy gameplay provides bite-sized strategy without a major time commitment* Charming 16-bit-esque visuals and humorous writingNegatives:* No save functionality* A button to fast-forward through the computer's turn would have been nice			",134,62,1,27,14,2,37

SPECIAL NOTE: After reading the steam reviews, if you still want this game, remember this: by going to ""options"", then ""gameplay options"", you can see an option to modify ""game speed"". Putting this up to 6 will make AI turns much faster and possibly much more bearable for you.Delve Deeper is a game that may fare much better as a tangible board game than as a digital video game. For example, games of Delve Deeper range from 15 to 25 rounds and can involve between two to four players (human or AI). However, all human players MUST be present at the same computer; this is what hotseat gaming means. Online multiplayer is not possible, though the developers have said this may be a feature in Delve Deeper 2.Each game can then last from 25 minutes minimum (at fastest game speed) to more than 1 hour, depending on game speed and number of players and monsters on a map. Players (and the AI which controls the monsters individually) will take turns moving their characters throughout the tunnels collecting ores and treasures.However, the turn-taking aspect WILL turn off players used to faster gameplay, especially if they intend on only playing against AI opponents. During your turn, you will have to move your dwarves individually. This is true for the AI dwarves, so having a maximum of three other opponent groups can drag out down-time between your turns. To make things worse, AI monsters are moved individually as well, and since they can easily outnumber the dwarves from twice to four times as much (which again depend on game settings), time is dragged out much much more.But all that aside, I enjoyed this game. I enjoyed the tactics involved when each player can add one tunnel per turn to benefit themselves or disadvantage others. I got excited when my dwarves raced against time and foes to deliver the riches before the final tally is made. And when everything goes to plan, I get oh so satisfied when enemies fall like dominoes and my dwarves snatch up treasure like flowers in a field.And as a sidenote, there is a collection mini-game of sorts: treasure chests contain textual descriptions of named treasures. These descriptions are then added to a ""Royal Gallery"" you can later peruse for your own very mild amusement.Ultimately, I recommend this game, but only in a particular circumstance: if you intend to have this game for parties. If you have a laptop and can set it up at party with little spillage of fluids, you and up to three other game-inclined friends can while an hour or two away, taunting and thwarting and triumphing as you move your groups of dwarves through the deep tunnels.

It straight up crashed to the desktop twice, and in the first battle I encountered, the screen has frozen and nothing is happening in the game.0/10, I've never seen a tutorial level this buggy.Oh, and ignore the 14 hours played.

												Fun and different. Imagine Terraria crossed with Worms. Moreover, start with Worms, then make the object of the game to mine gold instead of to kill the enemy worms. You still get to kill the enemy Dwarves, but that's not the point. And there are also monsters in the caverns that you'll dig out to contend with.A good waste of an hour here and there.So I thought this was a card game. I don't know why I thought that, but it's not.Anyway, I grade it a B.			",168,33,0,50,30,4,67

												This game would have been a better board game than a video game. It's you versus the enemy (or other players), and your goal is to gain the most treasure by the end of the game. The deeper you go, the better the loot. The game moves too slow to play for 5 or 10 minutes, but it ends too quickly to be satisfying. Playing against the computer, I found myself trying to use a strategy of digging as deep as I can to get the best kind of loot. But there's too much randomness in the loot, that I found myself losing really bad. And it's not the choices you make either. Sometimes, you bring up a treasure chest and it had a bomb in there, so you lose 5 gold. And sometimes, your opponent brings up a treasure chest, and it had 10 gold. Not fair. This is the Monopoly of video games. Fun idea, but throw strategy out of the window. ",821,290,19,116,69,6,135

												delve deeper is more like a table top game like dungeons and dragons, game of thrones, catan and etc. it has that unique feeling to it. it can play 1 player or more where the objective is gather the most gold, survive against other players and monsters and bring treasure back to the king. you can expand your own tunnels to dig deeper or find new caverns or you can extend your enemies tunnels and attact monsters to attack them so they can keep them busy while you take the lead. very fun and it deserves more reccomendations. right now got on sale but it will go back to 5 bucks and yes 5 bucks is good enough to enjoy this game.

												Maybe it's the beard talking, but I've always liked dwarves more than elves. They don't care about harmonizing with trees and developing anorexia. They're a race of hairy, pudgy alcoholics, and if there's anything in fantasy lore I can relate to, it's going to be that.Delve Deeper(!) is a strategy game about mining. You command a team of five dwarves as they try to collect more treasure than any other team and win their king's praise. Each turn begins by placing a piece of tunnel into one of the unoccupied hexagons on the map to reveal any treasure within and build paths to yet more treasure (or to connect tunnels containing monsters to opposing teams' tunnels for your amusement and possible gain).Next, the dwarves are moved. Once a player ends their turn, that team's dwarves hang lanterns where they stand (as in Minecraft, light prevents monsters from spawning), and mine any nearby treasure, fight any nearby enemies, heal, or drop their treasure off, depending on what occupies the space alongside them.Delve Deeper has a pretty good sense of humor, most often taking the form of the Dwarven King's reactions to the dwarves' success or lack thereof. There's referential humor as well, but it thankfully doesn't feel as though it's being used as a crutch, as referential humor so often is.The gameplay is tactical, but easy to learn and most certainly fun. Everything from AI difficulty to monster and treasure frequency can be set to meet the player's needs. Aesthetically, the game is quite charming, considering it features a bunch of hairy, pudgy alcoholics. At $5, Delve Deeper is definitely worth a shot.			",401,187,13,44,46,6,60

												Though initially a seemingly solid puzzle/tile game focused on acquiring treasure, it quickly becomes clear that this game is not about that. The first few turns of a game are spent strategically placing tiles, optimizing your dwarves' carrying capacities, and defeating a handful of monsters that delay you.However, less than halfway through the game, you break into the ""deeps"" levels of the map and out swarm literally dozens of monsters. They dogpile on your team, run around with impunity, and also each takes its own bloody turn to move and animate. At this point, watching the ""EVVIL"" team's turn process took several times as long as mine and the AI's turns combined.Worse, there was no way out of this cascading fail state. Your dwarves get up after a turn of being knocked out, but they're at 1HP and will assuredly lose any fight they get into. Of course, they get into a fight every turn, because the enemies are fast and aggressive enough to shut down your entire operation.A game supposedly about efficient mining turned into a boring slog to pass turns as my dwarves were all continuously incapacitated. Delve deeper is a clever idea marred by terrible balance and cascading, inescapable failure states that remove almost all player agency from the game.			",227,33,2,43,32,0,61

												Theoretically it has a fun board-game aesthetic, and might be a decent game, but in the 40 minutes I played it crashed to desktop or froze in a fight animation 4 times.  As it stands, this game is completely unplayable.Now, what I managed to see was alright.  The random loot items were amusing, and the strategy element of expanding your tunnels or your enemy's tunnels to try and flood them with monsters or reroute them away from a loot filled area was interesting.  Really though, any match is going to last longer than 10 minutes, so the state of the game is essentially that it will crash before you finish playing, and you'll lose everything.  Not worth whatever you pay, except for maybe the steam trading cards.			",255,88,1,54,48,3,46

												I picked this game up a while ago and remember playing it for maybe one game.  It received an update for Steam Trading Cards, so I figured I should try it again.  The tutorial is horrible to get through.  Too many unecessary words, no descriptions of classes.  At best I would say this game is mildly interesting.			",329,87,11,54,30,2,57

												This game keeps on crashing constantly.  Even during the times it doesn't crash so much, the game simply has a poor control setup, and weak gameplay.  The little saving grace it does have is a level editor where you can make a custom map for friends, but it really isn't so interesting when you are playing the map you created (as there is no mystery to the layout).  Even at a bargain price, this game is just so unfinished that there is no point to even wasting your time on it.			",740,459,28,137,106,8,126

												If you where to buy any game on steam for under 3$ this holiday season, Delve Deeper needs to be on that list. The game play is turned based and a bit slow, so it might not appeal to everyone. However if you can sit back and enjoy a game for what it is, then this casual game is for you. Rounds can last up to a hour depending on the amount of teams and turns. There is no game save so keep that in mind. The 2d art work is awesome and for the older gamers out there, will leave you with feelings of nostalgia from older games. The amount of puns and cultural references really add to the humor and replay ability. Enough rambling, buy this gem.			",168,35,1,18,10,2,22

												DORFAN GAEMS. Clever little turn-based strategy about competing to haul the most amount of treasure in a set number of turns. It's very board-gamey in its precision gameplay of managing limited resources, from building sabotage tunnels that bring nasty monsters into your opponent's base to accounting for the number of turns you'll need to make it to the nearest treasure drop-off point.Delve Deeper is a very dynamic and compact strategy game perfect for fun half-hour gaming jaunts, plagued only by some inconvenient & occasionally frustrating controls.

												This is the single worse game to ever claw its way out of hell into our mortal world. Whoever created this game was truely the anti-christ. This game isnt' even playable I can't believe Steam was low enough to sell it. I use sell very loosely because only truely misguided people like myself have bought this game thinking they got a great deal. If you did. You were truely wrong. This was the biggest waste of your money possible. Its a super cheap game thats how you know it was a bad move if it was a giant ♥♥♥♥ing waste of money. Please whoever created this game never show your face again. I truely can't believe you thought you could pass this as a game. I really can't believe you'd do that. You haulted human progress. You actually ruined everything humans have been doing for thousands of years with this game. You should be shoved onto a rocket and sent into deep space to never been seen by our race's eyes ever again. I just pray to the poor soul that ends up buying this after I post this review. If you buy this you are truely making the biggest mistake of your life. I'm not even joking in the slightest. The only good this about this game is it sets the bar as the worse game EVER. You actually can't make a worse game than this, and if you did you didn't make a game. Check again you didn't make a game you just took a♥♥♥♥♥♥on a keyboard and saw what the result is. There isn't a number out of ten to accurately describe how horrible this game and its creator truely are. Please. PLEASE don't make another one. One is enough.

												Totally recommend this game. I didn't like it for the first ten minutes when it gave me the tutorial, but after I turned it off and winged it for myself, I realized this game has great potential. I would suggest turning up everything, treasures, monster, movement speed, you name it. Raise it all (except difficulty) and it will be a total blast. You and your dwarven squad DELVE DEEPER into the mines and mine things, and then you get to see other players do the same but get slaughtered by monsters because they weren't careful enough. I would be outraged if this game was 60 bucks, but it is well worth the 5 dollar standing price. Please get it. It is absolutely delicious! <3			",135,21,4,32,32,0,23

												This game lacks depth of any kind. (ha) The game mechanics are so simple that youll get them down in about 10 minutes, but there is no form of progression so after that first 10 minutes its just the same thing over and over.It has controller support but it wont seem to work if you start the game with your keyboard and mouse. You cant switch between the two. It also has a very limited options menu. You cant pick different resolutions which means for windowed mode you are stuck playing in a small box. The bars for the sound sliders are really anoying. You have to click for it to go up or down by 1 level at a time. It seems like a port from a console. (Which it might be idk)3/4 of the game is spent watching the NPC take their turn. There is no option for skipping npc turns or battle animations. Most of the game feels like boring padding.The game really comes down to luck and has no strategy or skill involved. The gems you mine bearly make a difference. The game basically comes down to who gets the luckeist with their artifacts.If the devs could add some more depth with maybe a patch or some dlc then the game may be quite good as they have a very solid base to build a great game. Until then though, I can't recommend anyone this game.			",271,45,1,57,28,2,30

												The concept of this game is really really cool, in my opinion. Unfortunately the excution... isn't as great. There's A LOT in this game that could seriously use some improvement. Hopefully they'll work on the weak points if they ever make a sequel. In general it's some cool turn based strategy, although luck is a big factor too. You open new tunnels and gather riches with your team of dwarves battling to earn more points than your opponents in a given number of turns. However watching the animations of the wild creatures moving 1 unit at a time when there are hordes of them... Gah! Plus... if you release too many, you won't be able to continue playing. They will keep downing your dwarves over and over again, preventing them from returning to the base where they could heal and carry on fighting. Also... the map editor is horrible, using that requires a hell lot of patience. This game is still somewhat nice,  but a few frustrating things seriously need improving.			",754,315,16,92,65,9,123

REALLY HATE IT. and also, i love insanely tl;dr tutorials that cram a small sentence of interesting, non-obvious information in the midst of 9 pages of filler text and ""CLICK YOUR LEFT MOUSE BUTTON TO CLICK!"".Maybe it's okay on console, at least when Playing With Pals (not gonna actually suffer through the terrible controls long enough to find out for sure, but I'm getting the feeling the AI opponent would end up being pretty boring and predictable) but the developers put precisely no effort into making this a fun or playable PC experience (did I mention you can't rebind controls? because you can't) so ♥♥♥♥ them and basically ♥♥♥♥ every single indie developer because they're all pretentious beta-personality ♥♥♥♥♥ men.Do Not Play This Cumbersome Stupid Game.

												Overall this is a light, fun game. It's not particuarly deep but it's amusing enough to make it worth it the price.I do have two complaints about it. First the default speed is way to slow, I had to crank the speed up to maximum to avoid going crazy waiting for the AI to finish it's turn. Secondly the AI is pretty awful, it does better at some maps than others but it's pretty easy to beat it and not that uncommon to score 2x the AI's score.			",111,22,0,39,27,3,43

												The game gets boring really fast. While it has a lot of potential the potential is mostly lost in the clunky controls and repetative gameplay.The game consists of building up tunnels to ""Delve Deeper"" into a mountain. However a lot of your turns are spent either sitting on a mine or returning to base. You have three different classes, the scout who has more moves, the miner which has more inventory and the soldier which has more health. However since you end up using all your dwarves for just about everything, the you can't really take advantage of the class difference. Also since you can't trade between dwarves, you may a scout obtain soldier relics or something similar. The controls are by far the worst part of the game though. You select a hexagonal space by centering a giant hexagon in the center of your screen over it. It makes it insanely annoying to do anything. Also it's easy to make unintentional moves when selecting dwarves and moving your camera through the field.That being said, the game is rather challenging. Even the easy mode AI is a tough fight. Games are not extremely long so you have to make the most of every move. If you're looking to kill some time, you might try this game. However I would not recommend buying it for more then a $1 as it is not a very expansive game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game gets boring really fast. While it has a lot of potential the potential is mostly lost in the clunky controls and repetative gameplay.The game consists of building up tunnels to ""Delve Deeper"" into a mountain. However a lot of your turns are spent either sitting on a mine or returning to base. You have three different classes, the scout who has more moves, the miner which has more inventory and the soldier which has more health. However since you end up using all your dwarves for just about everything, the you can't really take advantage of the class difference. Also since you can't trade between dwarves, you may a scout obtain soldier relics or something similar. The controls are by far the worst part of the game though. You select a hexagonal space by centering a giant hexagon in the center of your screen over it. It makes it insanely annoying to do anything. Also it's easy to make unintentional moves when selecting dwarves and moving your camera through the field.That being said, the game is rather challenging. Even the easy mode AI is a tough fight. Games are not extremely long so you have to make the most of every move. If you're looking to kill some time, you might try this game. However I would not recommend buying it for more then a $1 as it is not a very expansive game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a fun little turn-based strategy game. Cool theme too. Not perfect, but very fun.			",14,15,0,2,1,0,2
