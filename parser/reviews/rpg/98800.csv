												I want to tell you the story of one of the most fantastic adventurers I ever created, his name is Gershwin. He began as a strange idea for the most stupid type of character I could have made. He would punch everything, get the crap kicked out of him, and drink every philter of booze he found. I crafted him and then set him loose on the first level and was amazed when he did not die immediately. I followed his adventures as he raided kitchens, punched robots to death, and drunkenly stumbled through level after level. He made it farther than any other character I had made, I formed a massive backstory for him as he went that bordered on actual fanfiction. It was the most beautiful thing that has ever happened. Gershwin swaggered onto yeat another level and began tearing through the obstacles in the best hat zorkmids could buy.  Gershwin ran into a room filled with fountains and saw a single lutefisk warrior on an outcropping. He rushed over to give him what for like the gentleman adventuer he is, but the warrior must have known him by reputation as he started to hide behind the nearest fountain. Gershwin rushed over and gave him the, ""Dance of One Thousand Boots."" Then Gershwin realized, he had kicked the fountain in his haste as well. The fountain had landed in an immovable position and was wedged there forever. My heart broke in that moment because I knew, Gershwin would forever be bobbing his eyebrows on that stone islet. Never to adventure again. He is now the only save file that will forever remain, and Gershwin will forever be punished for my hubris. Buy Dungeons of Dredmor, have adventures, inadvertently enact a tragedy.			",55,15,0,1,1,2,1

												Some say that a god cannot exist. Those who say that have not met our Lord and Saviour Lutefisk. The Lutefisk is a kind giver, and also a taker, for one cannot recieve what they are not willing to give away. Thus has been taught to me by the Lutefisk. As we delve deeper, we will all be taught by the Lutefisk; we will all join the Cult of the Lutefisk. However, a new Cult is not the only thing that Dungeons of Dredmor offers.     As a roguelike RPG, gameplay is simple: run around, grab loot, kill monsters, and don't die (and not just because Lutefisk does not promise an afterlife). However, there are many fun and exciting features. An advanced set of skill selection, in the form of multiple skill trees with linear paths, keeps combat unique and different. For example, I have had builds where I run around and just kick monsters to death (yes I mean kick, as in with a boot) while dual-wielding shields and builds where I teleport in, drop mines, push monsters onto said mines, and teleport out of explosion-related danger. There are several different interactions in the game that either reward or punish you. For example, Krong, the God of Anvils, leaves blessed anvils randomly on floors in the dungeon that you can enchant your gear with. It is not until you place your gear on the anvil, the point of no return, when you find out if Krong blesses or curses you. And of course, interactions involves our dear Lutefisk. Tithing Lutefisk at a Lutefisk Shrine, a food item that offers barely any health regen, may appease the Lutefisk God, and he may give you an enchanted item. DoD also offers a completely fair difficulty curve: each floor means significantly harder enemies. Therefore, as logic dictates, you should complete the entire floor you're on for as much experience and items as possible. The only exception to this rule is random minibosses and of course, Dredmor. Minibosses are literally there to make sure you're paying attention to the game. If you're punching everything, and notice this one monster is doing half your health in one hit, you should probably use a different strategy. Dredmor is a completely overpowered piece of... bologna... but I mean, to me this makes sense. It's HIS dungeon, HIS realm of power, and you're trying to stop him. If he was weak, why would a HERO (and quite the hero you are!) need to stop him? If nothing else, this hard task merely forces you to further investigate every chest, to question every move, and to work ever harder at making that perfect combination of skills.     Another good part about this game is that it's very accessible. There are three difficulty levels, permadeath is optional (so you can save your dearest characters), there is an option for smaller floors with the same experience gain, and with DLC, there is an option for 5 more floors of grinding before the boss. Speaking of DLC quickly, two DLC packs are super cheap (2.99 USD each and actually the Deluxe edition has the game and those two DLC for just 6.99 USD), and the third DLC pack is free. Cheap and easy to get into means that casual players can enjoy as well, while advanced difficulties and more options means that the hardcore Roguelike fan can cater to their style as well.     Another important thing about DoD in my opinion is the community. This is one of the most friendly, most helpful, best communities I have ever experienced on any game ever. Most questions get answered in minutes, and the number of guides for new players is seemingly limitless. These same helpful and friendly people also make amazing mods that add even more playability to a game I haven't been bored for even a second in.     TL;DR: All in all, DoD is an accessible, fun, pun-packed, Cult-creating, deceptively simple Roguelike RPG with a good community and workshop integration. I would highly recommend this game even off of a sale, and when on sale I will attest that it's literally a ""can't miss"". If anybody has any questions, ask in the comments section, I will do my very best to answer them in a timely manner. Similarly, I will try to continue to edit this guide at appropriate times.        The""Your TL;DR is still annoyingly long, sir.""TL;DR: Very fun, creative game; amazing community; astounding Workshop content; optional Cult participation. Worth every penny.

												Now that reviews are here, let me review the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game.Dungeons of Dredmor is, in one word, the-seriously-best-game-ever.No? Well, maybe I'm overstating. But it's definitely one of the best -if not THE best- Roguelike I've ever played. I will always return to this game. It will constantly captivate me in its shiny roguelike eyes. Maybe it's because every character you make can have a new and exciting build. Maybe it's because no run-through is exactly the same. Maybe it's because there's actual crafting that's better than in some big name MMO's. Maybe it's because your death is always your own damn fault. Or maybe it's because diggles are so cute (but they hate you so much). I don't know, probably all of the above (definitely). I will always love this game and this game will always show me a good time. If you know what I mean. And I think you do.Negatives? The humor is sometimes a little too much, I think, like every-blooming-thing needed to be funny. Oh, there's funny in there, but sometimes you just want the flavor texts to give it a rest already. Furthermore, I guess the art style turns off some people, not me personally, but I've heard it as a complaint. I can understand that, but my advice would be to ignore it and just try it.You won't be disappointed.			",245,82,0,49,8,1,45

												Before you get this game, I strongly advise that you do some research.Not because the game sucks, it's actually one of the best roguelikes I've played recently, but because of a problem I'll describe.The game has an auto-save feature that sometimes crashes the game (Runtime Error).You can NOT remove this auto-save feature, which wouldn't be a problem if it didn't corrupt savefiles, but unfortunately it does.The developers of this game even acknowledged the issue, but did nothing after 2 years of knowing about it.The only workaround is to:1) Turn off Steam Cloud2) ""Save and Continue"" in the menu (unavailable if you play Permadeath mode)3) Manually backup your savefiles from Windows folders every now and then,  so when it happens you can replace the corrupted saveI lost a 28 hours savefile due to not knowing of this issue, and I'm not gonna recommend the game despite it being rather good. I might give this another try someday, but right now I'm stunned.Do yourself a favor and do some research before you get this game, and you won't be caught offguard.			",237,112,1,20,5,0,3

												  In 1980 a game called 'Rogue' was born. Since then, a genre known as Rogue-like was born.A rogue-like game typically features a randomised dungeon, turn based movement and a plethora of skills and items at your disposal. Classic RPG weapons and armor, wizardry and sneaky rogues fighting monsters, all drably illustrated with ASCII graphics.Dungeons of Dredmor takes all that, slaps on a easy mouse interface, some charming graphics and audio, and chucks on some good humour to boot. This is quite possibly the only game - now and forever - where I can roll a beserker viking pirate communist emo vegan. Monsters will waltz up to me moaning ""I wasn't even supposed to be here today"". It won't make you laugh until your face falls off, but it'll have you smirking with the occasional ""hah!"" throughout.If you're just curious and never tried a rogue-like before, give it a shot. It's a fairly simple game, but with enough hardcore depth to have you reaching for the wiki once you get into it. It also has a range of addons found on the Steam workshop, so there's never an end to the strange setups you can employ and the delightful humour it prizes. It's often on a 75% off sale during holiday periods, and at that price it's well worth a dabble and beyond good value.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dungeons of Dredmor is a rather by the book implementation of the concepts presented by the nethacks, rogues, and past games of the genre known affectionately as, ""rogue-like,"" you take the genre and pump it full of Internet Memes, Canada and Scandanavia jokes, and then add Diggles...  Like a packing plant pumping their meat full of water and a hint of salt.The game plays well, and is rather thoroughly randomized, the difficulty stems more from your skill choices than from the game's settings, death can be permanent if you wish, and after playing a game or two you may like that extra bit of pressure on you.The hand drawn animated deaths are nice and the game has a sense of humour about the entire affair, you'd be surprised the variety of ways one can die.The DLC for the game do flesh it out a bit, and when on sale it's well worth picking up.This is a solid rogue-like game - one you should give a try.

												This game is amazing. 280 hours on record, and counting. There are lots of skills and so much variation it's unreal. And then there's user-created content. A lot of which is balanced and well thought out, showing how much people enjoy the game.This is one of the best $5 games ever made. The variety is great, the humour is great, and the DLCs are nice add-ons to an already great game.If you're after the latest 3D graphics, this game isn't for you. But if you can put that aside and appreciate the graphics for what they are, you are in for a treat.A large part of the game's greatness is due to the character customization. You choose seven skills , which may be related to fighting, magic, roguey stuff, or general skills that are slotted into one of those three categories. Each of those options is actually a skill tree, with multiple skills that you unlock as you level up. You can also do a ton of crafting, or none, as you wish.This game is all about giving us players the choice to try to win the game however we like, which is why I will keep going back to it again and again.

												This game... oh, this game.Very rarely do I find a game that I consider I might actually play -Forever- (or at least until I am no longer able to).  This is one of those games.  I will play it, revisit it, time and time again, until I can't anymore.  It's that epic.True to it's rogue-like nature, there is very little hand-holding in this game.  There isn't -too- much to figure out for yourself, but there is definitely enough to keep things interesting.  The turn-based combat is refreshing, as is the way you can use items (clicking on an enemy while holding a bolt from your inventory will shoot them with said bolt).  The base stats are a a refreshing new twist, with stats not seen in any other games.  Of course, you've got about a million ways to start your character depending on what type of play-style you're going through.  Base stats serve only to enhance secondary stats, which are used throughout most of the game.  Nothing big to figure out, but you could definitely be a min/maxer if you wanted to be.  I prefer the role-play / lore route.Perma-death mode is the only mode I'll ever play.  As your characters die, your name, level, and score all get added to a giant headstone which shows all of your previous deaths as well.  Making it exceedingly interesting to see just how much farther you can push into the dreaded Dungeons of Dredmor.Over all, I HIGHLY recommend this game.  I feel like it is one out of over 150 titles that I own that I got much, much more than I paid for.  If you pass this one up, you're missing out.  Buy it.  Buy it now.			",206,17,2,29,9,1,31

												This is typical old-school roguelike. That means you will enter the dungeon many times with different characters and this time they will have really crazy sets of skills. It's worth to try how is to play as vegan, tourist or geologist. This is definitely something that other games don't allow.If you still not convinced, maybe powerful crafting system will convince you. You will create hundreds of different items, starting on potions, ending on Chainaxe or the Historically Inaccurate Viking Helm.VERDICT:If you're a roguelike fan, this it's must have for you.If you have never tried any roguelikes, this is a good game to convince you to that genre.If you like only modern shooters, you will never have opportunity to wear the Communist Power Ushanka.Like this review?

												Dungeons of dredmor is an example of ""don't judge a book by its cover"". Initially, it looks poorly made, but once you start playing you can find yourself immensed in the game. There are tons of items, craftables and combinations to make. Battle is fluent despite of being turn based, and there are plenty of class and spell combinations to try out. Overall it has a great variety for such a ""small"" game! A big plus is also the fact that there are several difficulty levels, including a ""softcore"" mode where dying doesn't mean game over. This makes it equally enjoyable for hardcore roguelike fans as well as more casual players who would like to give the genre a try. Strongly recommended :)			",218,129,2,37,18,2,33

  Content Score Details   Gameplay 9/10 DoD is a roguelike dungeon-crawler with some RPG elements. It's quite simplistic: turn-based movement and combat, with procesdurally generated rooms, monsters, and loot. You are given a choice of seven skills when you create your character, which have different abilities and powers as you level them up. Simplistic yet fun.   Graphics 7/10 You're not going to find anything fancy here, but Dredmor has it's own unique art style.   Story/Quests 5/10 Evil lich Dredmor was captured, evil lich Dredmor is breaking free. So the kingdom needs a hero. Unfortunately, this is you. You can pray to the Goddess of Sidequests to get sidequests, but they can be really annoying and difficult.  Overview 8.5/10 DoD is an enjoyable roguelike. While it does suffer from a few minor bugs, and setting up mods without the game breaking can be long and tedious, it is worth it for the sheer amount of gameplay, as well as the DLC.

												Few games personify the attempt to make Rogue friendly and approachable like Dredmor. There are lots of games out there now that rock a similar angle— many of them good, some of them great— but very few retain the structure of Rogue like Dredmor. Here you will find bare-bones inventory management(so many times you'll drop things, rearrange them, et cetera), permadeath(though it can be turned off), procedurally-generated labyrinths and stupid monsters. The crafting system, the skill trees, all of it is designed to let you fall through the cracks. All of it is designed around letting you die.And it is gloriously addictive, if you like that sort of thing.The first forty hours of Dredmor I didn't even get to see the namesake Lich at the bottom of the dungeon. I was playing on the hardest difficulty, with permadeath, and I just kept dying before the fifth floor. Then, suddenly, playing a character named Pyra Mancy, everything lined up perfectly and victory was assured. It was delicious.Triple A games have abandoned this concept, that insane difficulty makes ultimate success that much more rewarding. But of all the games I've beaten on my gameslist, it's no wonder that I'm proudest of Isaac and Dredmor. The art is amateurish, the music repetitive, the story nonexistant.But it nails the sense of accomplishment that comes with patience and dedication, and for that, it's well worth the asking price.

Beware of the false shepherd Lutefisk!Caution! You're now entering the Diggle Danger Zone!Developer: Gaslamp Games, IncPublisher: Gaslamp Games, IncFormat: PCReleased: August 1st, 2012Yeah, good luck playing any video games today with this guy staring at you with his big... deep... fishy eyes.(The Lutefisk God is not to be confused with Dagon, Prince of the Sea. That's, uh, a different video game.)Let me start by saying that Dungeons of Dredmor is rogue like dungeon crawler and a parody of those at the same time. Lovely isn't it?Oh boy where do I begin?I think this game was my first step into the roguelike genre and it became my favorite genre by far ever since.Having said that let's get down to business.StoryYou're the chosen one. The hero. The man or the woman with the eyebrows of destiny! It's your duty to venture into the depths of the Dungeon of Dredmor and to show not only him but also every damn Diggle you'll encounter on your way who's Boss: The one with the most majestic eyebrows ever! and that is you!GameplayDungeons of Dredmor is turn based game means you move on a tile based square grid where you and your enemies take turns. Each floor is randomly generated meaning you will never see the same layout, types and amount of enemies or loot. Every single playthrough will be an unique and unforgiving experience.Before you experience your first death by a fierce Diggle you will have to choose the difficulty and your seven starter skills.You can choose between warrior skills like Swords, Axes, Maces or Smithing, rogue related skills like assassination, daggers or burglary and you can obviously become a powerfull wizard using skills like golemancy, alchemy or Astrology.There have been several expansions for this game so far and each expansion includes some new skills like Demonologist (Realm of the Diggle Gods), Clockwork Knight (You have to name the expansion pack. <- yes you really have to) and Tourist (Conquest of the Wizardlands).After choosing skills to your like or letting the game choose some randomly for you it's time to enter the dungeon!The game starts as you take control of our Hero with those beautiful eyebrows. Your goal is to get to Dredmor and to show him who's boss (obviously that's you but he didn't get the memo yet).In order to reach Dredmor you'll have to fight your way through fierce Diggles, grab some better loot and also level up.While exploring your surroundings and getting beat up by those Diggles you will encounter several objects you can interact with. Like a well with a blue liquid in it. Too blue to be water so you take a sip and here comes's the beauty of the game. The effect will be random meaning you can get healed which would be sweet so you can get your revenge on those Diggles (ye I they're our arch enemy!) or you can get poisoned and die a pathetic death.Also there's Krong. You will have a serious love and hate relationship with this fellow. You will find some anvils in the dungeon. Interacting with it will either bless you and upgrade one of your items or Krong will curse you for not cleaning your teeth this morning.Also keep in mind that some area of effect skills can and will hurt you as well just in case you think it would be a good idea to set the ground on fire. It's gonna get hot and you won't like it trust me.Then there's also Brax. A bad♥♥♥♥♥shop keeper who clearly isn't scared of all those damn Diggles.You can buy and also sell loot. If you are brave enough you could also see if you are fast enough to steal something but ... that's up to you to decide. You will have to face the consequences.VisualYou either love the Art Style or you hate it. There's not much else. Personally I really Diggle (hah see what I did there!?) the Art Style and I think it's just fitting for this game. It's not looking to serious and let's be honest: Nothing's serious in Dungeons of Dredmor.The only thing that's a bit meh is the UI but the way the game looks is quite charming.What else can I say about this game?Gaslamp Games made a lot of things right I'd even go as far as to say nearly perfect if not for some minor interface issues and also the crafting in this game is tad clunky.If you can overlook the art style (which probably isn't to everyone's liking) and the minor interface issues you will deeply enjoy this game.Given you like roguelikes and getting beat up by Diggles ...

												An incredible amount of replayability for such a small price tag.  I've had this game for more than two years, and I keep coming back to it.  I haven't even beaten Dredmor; I just keep trying out different skill tree combinations, seeing what works together.

												This is a game I've owned for quite a long time now, and before I begin I will clarify that I have way more 10 hours play time on this game, as at many times in the past I have been without internet access and this has always been my go to offline game, I'm sure the number is much more close to 50 hours or so and it still remains my go to offline game.I've mentioned in other reviews that I don't like games with a short lifespan and little replayability, well this game then is an absolute wonder to me because not only does it provides almost an endless amount of gameplay and tons of replayability, it is incredibly addictive and fun to play.The mechanics are very simple and there is little to no story at all, which leaves your imagination to get carried away and fill in the gaps as you crawl through the large dungeon areas slaying hoards of quirky little monsters and farming items you have no desire to eat, use or sell. This is a game where you will probably only ever be using the arrow keys and a mouse click, and the simplicity of this provides an easy gaming experience.I will say I have never played past the medium difficulty level, and I will go further as to say that I have never even completed a single save, I don't usually play with permadeath on either, it's mainly a case of me creating various heroes and forgetting how far I got on each one and deciding to start all over again. This is not a game you could finish in one sit through, even when enabling the mode which reduces the size of the levels, this game is still massive and takes a lot of time to cover each area and collect each item.One thing I would imagine playing this game is that the simplicity and repetitiveness of this game would get boring, but it never seems to do that, I believe it is probably the desire to push on for more loot, gold and exp to max our your skill sets, as well as find interesting new items with cool stats and comparing them with your current inventory, perhaps one of the most thrilling discoveries you can make on any level is finding the store, which always stocks a bizaare inventory.The music is also really good, and while it may feel repetitive at some points, it still manages to sound really great and perhaps helps in setting the mood for becoming immersed in the game.I would say the main factor for enjoying this game is that it excels in making you feel that you have achieved and made progress, there are a lot of achievements you can unlock, and two expansions which add more levels and crazy skills to master, this is definitely a great entry and perhaps a little overlooked work within the roguelike genre and I cannot recommend it enough.That being said, this game is pretty buggy at times, the levels appear to be randomly generated and at times this can result in some items being blocked off and unattainable without the right skills, and this while slightly annoying, doesn't really take much away from enjoying the game, the game was also very buggy when I played it around it's time of release, but it does seem a lot more stable now. So I would still say it's definitely worth picking up especially given how good the price is.			",224,54,9,33,28,3,41

												-TL;DR at Bottom-Dungeons of Dredmor is simultaneously an addictively expansive roguelike with heaps of replay value and a disappointingly, shallow experience, and in this way, it is the World of Warcraft of it's genre. For it's price it absolutely is worth it, but at the end of the day you are left wishing the devs would have put a bit more thought into the game to create a solid experience.At it's base, DoD is a turn-based dungeon crawler with painfully basic combat. You walk around rooms, meet monsters, left click them until they're dead. Occasionally you'll meet a situation where the enemies are statistically and/or numerically superior to you, at which case you must randomly spam offensive/defensive items and abilities at the issue until it's solved, and you really don't even have to pay much attention to exactly what it is you're using. It's just too inconsequential, regardless of the vast amount of options available to you. Increasing the difficulty or enabling perma-death somehow manages not to address this issue, it simply requires for you to pay more attention to the handful of mechanics that really matter. It might seem better for the first few floors of each playthrough, but regardless of settings and skillbuilds, the experience will degrade into the above mentioned simplicity by floor 5 no matter what it is you do, which is primarily due to XP and high level items being too abundant, leading to overleveling reducing the difficulty. Again, this stems from a lack of critical thinking employed in the basic game design, and while it'd be unfeasible to change anything at this stage of the game, it should have been taken much more seriously back in it's development infancy. The importance of a balanced experience distribution in an RPG game is one of the first things any old scrub with a couple hours of dabbling in RPG Maker learns, so it's downright embarrassing that Gaslamp Games took it so lightly.So that's the core of the game. Why is this a good purchase then? Well the game has three factors that save it from itself; Humor, Content and Steam Workshop.Humor, I would say, is DoD's greatest asset. Without it's presence, it would crumble and fall into the realms of indie shovelware, and it combines together with a feature that you can never go wrong with; content. So there's a lot of humor is what I'm trying to say. So the way this game works is, after presumably completing the short tutorial course, you start a new game and enter character creation. This process is unlike anything you've experienced before. You right off the bat get to chose a number of skill trees (1-8) for your Adventurer and decide your playstyle on the spot. The fun factor in this is all the various combinations made possible by this formula. Simply put, you can be a regular Melee user, a wizard or a mix of both, and if you'd like you can take the Warlock tree to help with that. Or not. It's very freeform, although hard to explain. Right off the bat you'll notice via the Skill Trees' descriptions that the game's funny. You have skill trees like ""Battle Geology: Like all geologists, you can create earthquakes, armor yourself in stone, and petrify enemies. "" and ""Warlockery: Warlocks are wizards that really wish they were warriors. Or Rogues. Or cheesemongers. Anything but wizards, really. Their ""spells"" (as they are) serve to make them less wizard-like in a variety of ways."". If these two make you chuckle, or at least make you go ""heh"" internally, then you'll have an absolute blast once you actually plunge into the game. Every item name, item description, skill, spell, room, monster, monster description - really everything that's anything with words on it will have humorous dialogue that simply never gets ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ old. Even monsters often make snarky comments from a list of a thousand or more phonemes. It ranges from low to high brow humor, references and even some memes here and there and it never feels distasteful or tired. If you're imaginative and weird, like me, you could also give a voice to all the text in your head, so that the Narrator from Trine 2, or hell, Jef Goldbloom says all the stuff, and it'll be all the more hilarious. And there's tons of this content, just tons and tons and tons. Rightfully so, because the game consists of 10-15 dungeons per run with each floor taking at LEAST an hour to complete unless you're leaving stuff unexplored.This is where the Steam Workshop comes in. I personally don't recommend playing the game without all 3 DLC's installed AND the majority of the workshop content subscribed to and loaded up. The almost inexhaustible supply of content is the single one thing that can and will distract you from how shallow a game Dungeons of Dredmor actually is. When you're pretending to be a Vegan Necromantic Steampunk Knight and reading funny bits all the time, you don't care about gameplay. You'll be immersed into the whackiest, stupidest scenarios you've ever seen and you'll make it work. It's all novelty, but when there's this much of it, it works better than a real freaking game.I should fleetingly mention that crafting and inventory management is a huge hit and miss. During some runs, I'll have patience and indulge in the hassle that comes with dealing with it. Other times I'll simply ignore 90% of the loot that spawns all over the floor and wish they put more effort into it. Ironically, while I'd say it's bad in this game, DoD's crafting is exactly what today's MMOs could use in order to make crafting actually freaking interesting. Because MMO's are MEANT to be timesinks, and items there would be worth the literal hours it takes to get specific equipment with noticable and snazzy uses like in DoD. As opposed to stupid junk you will NEVER pawn off on marketplaces, nor even think about using yourself. Oh and the music is loud and obnoxious but it grows on you.One last, last thing; The gameplay is crap, alright, fine. But I should tell you that if you're of the particularly imaginative sort, there's plenty of room to create fun, self-imposed challenges that could alleviate this issue. On a basic example, you could stylize your character to only wield clockwork/steampunk styled items, which limits your equipment and arsenal. You can take concepts like this to much deeper levels that I can't really explain without you having played the game. It's like those weird people you see on GameFAQ's making up weird challenge run guides for Final Fantasy games. You can do that if that's your sort of schtick.-TL;DR-Gameplay: 2/5 - Shallow. Relies on your imagination to make it fun. Not for the casuals.Replay Value: 5/5 - There's lots of ways to play and things to try and as a Roguelike, the game does excell.Content: 5/5 - Thousands upon thousands of hilarious descriptions, names and phonemes is the game's primary source of fun.Music: 3/5 - It grows on you, but nothing to write home about. Title song is catchy.Art: 3/5 - It's pixelart. It's alright. Level art styles will leave you scratching your head sometimes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Everyone who likes real roguelike games (as in games that are similar to the original 'rogue' game, not all these platform games and stuff that people keep calling ""roguelike"") must buy this game! This is the best modern adaptation of rogue/nethack/moria/etc that I've seen so far. (Also see Sword of the Stars for a good sci-fi themed game of this sort.) Crafting makes a good addition to the game, as does the excellent skill system. You're also given difficulty level settings and permadeath can be enabled or disabled.Overall this game just kicks♥♥♥♥♥and it's hard to find anything wrong with it.			",187,46,3,39,37,1,35

												This game definitely has all the characteristics of a roguelike but is modernized in a way that let's us mere mortals enjoy it as well, has a great artstyle and enjoyable humor, and of course, extreme difficulty.Your goal is to get through all ten floors and defeat the dreaded Lord Dredmor, but DLC adds an additional 5 floors as well as bonus floors. I would definitely recommend getting all dlc and the base game at the same time, especially considering the price for the amount of content.If you're not daring enough to get through the entire game on its intended settings you can disable permadeath and/or lower the difficulty.This game is also highly moddable, which should further extend the large amount of replayability that already exists in the base game, just look at the steam workshop for some fantastic user created mods.And remember, dying is fun!

												Oddly charming and brutally difficult in parts, Dungeons of Dredmor is nonetheless a stellar addition to the roguelike genre.Taking the role of the standard ""young man on a quest for glory"", Dredmor sets itself apart from the pack through a number of interesting and oft-hilarious mechanics, including varied skill trees, monsters who insult you with lines that could have been ripped out of The Secret of Monkey Island, a wide assortment of loot and armor (the descriptions are hilarious themselves) and a well-put together crafting system that rewards exploration and experimentation.This is the kind of game you can easily lose 50 or so hours to, and I've barely scratched the surface myself. Well worth the price, and definitely a game that will appeal to any fan of the genre.			",1970,825,79,262,266,29,338

												If you want to get started with roguelikes, Dungeons of Dredmor is as good a place as any. It straddles an important line between more mainstream adaptations of the concept and the originators, where neophytes can find easy access and veterans can find a new take on old ideas. And while it may not be perfect in a lot of ways, it passes the main test of being something you can play for way, way too long.Dredmor is really a traditional, grid-based, turn-based, everything-random roguelike dressed up in some handsome(ish) graphics and modern sensibilities. The only story you get is that you're a hero, and you're descending into the titular dungeons to whack the equally-titular Lord Dredmor. There's a thick layer of nerd humor over the whole package that runs more than skin-deep, as it even informs the class and stat systems. Luckily it's not the aggravating metahumor of something like Retro City Rampage, and is actually quite snappy and clever for the most part.The aforementioned class system is probably the big draw of DoD, for newbies and veterans alike. Each character you roll gets seven skill sets to choose from a list of dozens, including everything from sword and shield skills to veganism and communism. Every time you level up, you can unlock another skill from one of your sets, allowing you to knock out one tree with half a dozen levels or diversify as you see fit. Sets tend to be eclectic mixes of active skills and passive bonuses, with some being demonstratively better than others, but all of them interesting and worth a try.Outside of the skill system, there's admittedly not a lot of innovation to be found here. You wander the dungeon, grab loot, kill monsters, and so on. There are shrines to pray to, gods to appease, vending machines to shake, traps to disarm, levers to pull, and plenty of things to die to. Unlike the roguelikes of yore, however, death tends not to come all that swiftly in Dredmor. It's pretty easy to keep your stats and gear up with the challenge presented by enemies if you're cleaning out the floors, to the point that by floor three or so, nothing's going to kill you outside of a room completely packed with monsters.This ties into the main problem with Dredmor, the fact that individual runs can get pretty boring after a point. Unlike most roguelikes, the early game is when you need to pay attention to your skills and your loot. Once you get your rhythm locked in, levels start to blend together. The slow default move speed and animations drag things out a bit longer than they should, and your inventory and crafting windows really could have used another pass on usability. For as many steps forward that Dredmor takes as a modern roguelike, it has a couple feet planted firmly in the past.All that said, I was able to sink 30 hours into the game before I grew well and truly tired of it. And those were an enjoyable 30 hours of looting, smashing, and giggling at the goofy jokes. Dredmor will go a lot farther with those new to the roguelike genre, but there is undeniably something for everyone, at least while it stays fresh.			",488,212,8,71,62,7,65

												So, it's occurred to me that I've had this game for a long time (and played it for more hours than it even shows here) and yet I've never done a review of it as I usually do for favorite games.  'Bout bloody time I did.So, Dungeons of Dredmor... where to begin?  It's hard to really talk about all of the aspects of the game because there are SO MANY of them.  This is likely to be one of the first things you notice about Dredmor:  The sheer ridiculous amount of content, particularly once you have the expansions installed (and I highly recommend all three).  Character creation for example... even just the base game has 35 ""skills"" to pick from, with the number being just under 50 with the expansions installed.  And these skills are really skill SETS.  You choose 7 of them when you create your character (any combination is fine), and once you're in the game, each of these will start at their base skill.  When you level-up, in addition to getting a boost to your prime stats (more on that later) you also go into the big skill list, and you choose one of the seven to rank up.  Each rank in each set offers you something new... some fun new active ability, some wonky passive, some stats... in my experience, there really arent any ""duds"" among the skillsets here, and levelling up is always very satisfying.And the skills are VARIED.  There's some crazy stuff here.  Some of them are fairly basic... for example, sword skills, or crafting.  But then you get to Dredmor's general comedic weirdness.  For example, one of my favorites is the Bankster set.  Right from the start, this one gives you an ability called ""High Interest Loan"".  Use it, and a big pile of money drops at your feet.  Sounds good, right?  Well, it has a fair chance of then also hitting you with a ""Bankster debuff"", of which there are about 7 types.  ALL of them drain money from you in some fashion, with one of them lasting indefinitely until you either run out or the effect is removed.  Now it doesnt seem so good, yeah?  Well, that's where the rank 2 ability, ""Dump Toxic Assets"", comes in.  You can take any Bankster debuffs you have at the moment, turn them into poison-based damage, and fling them at your enemy.  As with any skills in the game, these have cooldowns, so using this set PROPERLY (as most of the abilities in the set can debuff you) requires that you time your skill usage correctly, and that you understand what they do.   Skills and spells in the game are like that:  Some of them get complicated in an interesting way, and they often tend to be fairly creative in how they behave.  I mean, really, when was the last time a game let you kill a giant angry carrot by having a bad credit score at it?   Things get even more interesting when these skill sets combine, and with so many, there's TONS of ways to synergize.Items are pretty similar:  Very creative, very diverse, very useful.  And this game LOVES it's items.  You'll get a ton of them.  WAY too many.  You have a large inventory, but you'll run out of space fast.  From things like food/drink (heal HP/MP) to potions or mushrooms to crafting equipment or much crazier stuff, the game has about a kersquillion items.  The best part is, most of them are actually USEFUL to you.  And that's good, because the game REALLY expects you to be using them.  While the combat, at it's core, may be simple (walk towards a monster to strike them, and of course you have your spells and such) the game likes to throw alot of monsters at you.  Sometimes a HUGE amount, in what are known as ""Monster Zoos""... big rooms where every single freaking tile has a monster on it.  You could get anywhere from 50 to 150 monsters in one zoo; zoos are effectively the ""boss fights"" of the game (complete with unique music) and there's one on each floor (but you dont know where!) except the first.  Beyond that, sometimes you get elite monsters, the occaisional monster from a couple floors up, and of course monsters have various stats and abilities, some getting rather unpleasant indeed.Which relates to one issue that some players may run into is that, yes, while the game may be accessible in some ways, it can get pretty darn tough.  I've seen plenty of players hit their first zoo and just get utterly splattered (and then try it a few more times, getting splattered even worse); traditional roguelikes dont exactly teach you to deal with 120 enemies (many of them with ranged spells or goofy abilities) all at the same time!  Yet the game expects you to do this on EVERY floor.  This is where all of those items and skills come in though... beating really tough encounters in this game, zoos or otherwise, is almost like solving a puzzle, carefully figuring out how to use all the stuff available to you to defeat it; you cant just beat everything over the head and do nothing else.  The good thing is that the game pretty much ALWAYS gives you the tools (there are a sqillion items lying around for a reason...) you just need to figure out how they can be used to get past a given situation.  It can get complicated.  Not to mention the way your stats work.  You have 6 primary stats, and 19 secondary ones.  Primary stats can affect secondary ones, but more than that, this means that there's LOTS of possible stats that can appear on equipment (or on buffs/debuffs).  Building your character well means understanding what all of these do.  In addition, there's ALSO like 16 damage types.  For players such as myself that love min-maxing and dealing with stats in these games, well, this game does it VERY well.  But for others this may be a major turnoff.However, this IS a roguelike... one way or another, there are so very, very many ways to die, yet one issue is that this is a LONG game.  Each floor is huuuuuuuuuuuge, and in the base game, there are 10 of them (with expansions, there are 15, as well as special side areas).  And there's about a gazillion things to do.  A full run-through of the game takes quite a long time.  This isnt exactly new for this genre, but it's very worth mentioning.   You have the ability to save & quit at absolutely any time though.  But it can be very frustrating to do something like get aaaaaaallllllll the way to Lord Dredmor (who is NOT a pushover) and then die to him.  All that time it took to get there... lost in one moment of SPLAT.   The game will never kill you in ways that are genuinely unfair, but that of course never stops frustration in a case like that.   Accessible though the game may be, it really is best suited to roguelike fans that are more than used to things like that happening.If you can get past that bit though.... this is an absolutely fantastic game.  I've played so many roguelikes, but this one is by far my favorite. It has it's small issues... but there's so very much going for it that it's way more than worth those minor quibbles.  Also it's got a really good sense of humor.Highly recommended.			",271,38,1,35,44,0,30

												Today, Dungeons of Dredmor (DoD) completes five years, and still remains a great introduction to the classic style of Roguelike, while it offers a great deal of challenge to veterans of the genre. DoD features character building, with a wide range of skills to choose; easy to understand mechanics; great dose of humor, with a lot of references to movies and games; a fantastic soundtrack (the best of this kind of game, IMHO); Steam Workshop support for mods and backup on Steam Cloud (despite the store page not show this feature). The gameplay it's slow paced, ideal for a strategic approach instead of an action-oriented one, and demands patience from the player. The biggest bless and curse of this game, at the same time, it's the loot fest at every level. When you start playing, you'll certainly spend a decent part of your playthrough managing your loot on your tiny inventory (remember to use Shift+left click to pick up  and drop items with more ease). Thankfully, the ""Conquest of the Wizardlands"" DLC adds the Pocket Dimension - a place where you can store unlimited amounts of loot. By the way, this game is so cheap that you should buy the complete package for a better experience. Last but not least, I strongly recommend you to activate the OpenGL on the launch options to achieve a smoother experience, avoiding crashes caused by memory leak, while it enable the Steam Overlay. To do this, simply right click Dungeons of Dredmor in your Steam library -> Properties -> Set launch options -> type in -opengl -> press ok. Funny fact:  Everyone that claims this game it's ""too easy"" never managed to beat it. Funny, huh? Despite the cartoonish graphics and light-hearted aesthetics, DoD can be brutal.

												A very accessible rogue-like with enough depth, strategy and personality to stand above most of the rest. The simple graphics and combat of Dungeons of Dredmor obscure its incredible depth of design, functional mechanics and polishing, and it really is a fully fleshed out title. My fun in Dungeons of Dredmor comes from battling through hoards of monsters while interacting with the world, using traps, spells, crafting and more, all while exploring ever deeper.HighlightsThere are plenty of little things that help this stand out and help to make it something more than most rogue-likes, but the central design philosophy of accessability and the respect it has for the classic elements that make rogue-like games so fun that make it very much worth my time and keep me coming back.A plethora of additions and extra gameplay elements like crafting and landmines which would easily become an annoying chore or distraction in other games has been made completely optional and ignorable here, yet still adds lots of practicality to the game when you spend the time.* The attention to enabling and supporting Steam Workshop content definitely deserves comment. It's been woven into the game perfectly and means sharing rooms, items, monsters and even things like insults and decorations is rewarding.* The humour deserves mention. There are references to movies, old video games and culture not just spread throughout the world, but even in the U.I. and elsewhere.Mistakes and AnnoyancesIt has been genuinely quite hard to find something to dislike about this game and the only things that are worth pointing out haven't really affected the fun I've had with this title, but they're here in the interest of a complete review. The main drawback or limitation of the game is in the simple and, some would argue, boring combat. Fighting thousands of monsters in the same way, typically using the same specific skills and abilities can wear thin and unless you're willing to make some form of goal and targets, or story for yourself, reasons for playing can easily feel empty and flat.* The tutorial is quick and simple, but also very lacking. There are a ton of gameplay elements and user interface mechanics that aren't covered anywhere and usually have to be searched for to learn about, or will simply be discovered by chance.* Dredmor, the end-game boss can feel out of place and the ending can feel abrupt for some.RecommendationsPresently available on Steam for £3.49/4.99€/$4.99 and with no real limit in replay value, Dungeons of Dredmor will take around 20 to 30 hours to complete a successful run, but reaching that run may take you 100 hours or more. As a result, it's very fairly priced and good value for money even when not on sale, yet routinely goes on sale for -50% and -75% and is a must buy for anyone looking for an approachable rogue like.The Complete version costs just 30% more, is available for £4.99/5.99€/$6.99. It is almost exclusively the better choice over the stand alone because it adds Conquest of the Wizardlands and the Realm of the Diggle Gods DLCs which add a total of 12 new Skill Trees, hundreds of new items, dungeon levels, monsters and mini-bosses and plenty more. Unless you don't expect to play more than a few hours or you're on a strict budget then there's no obvious reason not to grab the Complete pack.* Don't forget to install and name the Expansion Pack which is available for free.

												Dungeons of Dredmor is an intelligently designed Rogue-Like, it's very hard and extremely satisfying. You choose between a variety of perks when you start off your character, and it's crucial to pick a good build, because that's what you're stuck with for the entire run. The game has a moderatly strong sense of humour that come up in incredibly surprising places, the soundtrack is enjoyable, there's lots of enemy, item and level variety, but most importantly, there's no spiders (as far as I've been).Overall, I think that Dungeons of Dredmor is a very good game if you enjoy rogue-likes  and that you should pick it up with the DLC.

												You will die. You will die in the tutorial. You will die in the main game. But you will push on, you will persist, and in the end, by dint of hard work and mental fortitude... you will die again. Yeah. Just take a gander at my playtime.Dungeons of Dredmor is a frustrating and addictive time sink, with uproarious descriptions (like Self-Righteous Sword of White Lies: ""Really, it's for their own good"" and One-Armed Leather Jacket: ""Evidently we DO need another hero""), intermixable skill trees (you can be a Communist Vegan Tourist Pirate with the power of Mathemagic) and deceptively cute enemies.

												This game manages to be the perfect gateway into real roguelike games and also as hardcore as any other out there. Its tutorial makes beginners feel very welcome and prepares them for their journey(s) ahead. The charactercreation is more simplified than you would probably expect from a roguelike like DCSS, but the system of picking 7 different skills, thus having hundreds of different combinations makes your choices more than meaningful.What sets it apart from other genre competitors is its presentation handsdown. Where other roguelikes kind of lack in that department and are just pure gameplay, Dungeons of Dredmor has a lot of charm in its visuals and writing. This is one of those rare games thats overgrown with little jokes and references but still stays funny and unique.If you have never played a real roguelike and want to get into them, this is probably the best game for you. If you're a seasoned veteran, it is also a good pickup because of its unique skillsystem and refreshing presentation.			",262,56,12,19,14,4,19

												One of the better roguelikes on Steam. With all of the DLCs loaded, there are literally dozens of different skill trees that you can pick for a new character. Not to say that all of them are equally useful (because they're not), and it's entirely possible to cherry-pick an overpowered build - which, if you ask me, is perfectly alright: let people play how they want to. It makes hitting the 'random' button during character creation more exciting.The game's sense of humor will either totally pull you in or will totally put you off. Every skill, enemy, and item you find in the dungeon will have a description that's punny, a meta-reference to something else, and/or just silly. Personally, I love it, but I could see some people taking the game's lack of seriousness as a point against it.Levelling up almost always provides new skills and abilities that significantly improve your hero, so you really feel like you're getting more powerful - it's not just 'your mana bolt is now 1% stronger.'There are negatives/things that bother me:- There are only about a dozen different monster types. Going deeper in the dungeon will just unlock the same monsters with new color schemes.- By default, everything moves wayyyy too slowly. Hit the '+' key at least once when starting out so you don't have to spend hours watching your character amble along through the dungeon.- Inventory management is a total pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Even with the Wizardland DLC (which I highly recommend), which gives you your very own dimension to store all the crafting junk you come across, you'll still find yourself constantly running out of room because you've picked up a dozen types of cheese, a bar's worth of different types of booze, masses of mushrooms, crossbow bolts made out of six different materials of four different qualities (not even including one-off bolt types!), potions, throwing weapons, wands, etc., etc., etc. Get used to hearing ""Your inventory is full!""- The game's too long, and yet there are options to make it even longer! By default, there are 10 levels of the dungeon. At around dungeon level 5 or 6, your character will probably be strong enough that anything outside of massive monster zoos or a crazy mini-boss monster won't pose much (if any) threat. However, to be able to keep up with the power curve, you're going to have to grind through the levels anyway. With the DLCs, you have the option of expanding the dungeon to 15 levels, as well as having a virtually unlimited amount of wizarding worlds to explore - I would highly recommend NOT doing so.- While there's an option 'no time to grind', which makes the dungeon smaller (yet having a roughly equal XP curve), which I totally recommend playing with, do note that by choosing this option, you significantly alter the balance of loot - specifically, any crafting class will find it more difficult, since you'll run into significantly less materials.- Dredmor himself has been balanced against the twink builds. This means that it's possible to have a character that can clear out the entire dungeon but still be unable to actually win the game. Especially classes that are forced to go toe-to-toe with the big man himself - bring massive amounts of dodge and counter or you may as well just go home.All those things are real problems with the game. However, I've sunk 120 hours into this game and have won it at all difficulties (with permadeath), so I obviously think that the game is well worth playing, despite its warts.

												Where's the ""I'm not sure"" for recommending this game?The game leaves a fantastic first impression - it's easily one of the most intuitive, easy to learn Roguelikes, without sacrificing customization and a level of the strategy.  It's colourful, full of personality, and clearly made with love.  Amazing for introducing someone to the genre.It also, however, begins to drag after a while; a complete game with Realm of the Diggle Gods and full-sized floors takes an absurd amount of time for what quickly starts devolving into incredibly repetitive content.  Monsters have little variety, stellar equipment slowly starts fading into a pile of ultimately unremarkable items, there's extremely little secrets or rare content to discover... it lacks the meat, depth, and sense of discovery to actually sustain itself over long periods of time.So to be most specific on whether I'd recommend this game or not: If you don't know what the word ""Roguelike"" means yet, this is a great way to start the genre and enjoy yourself.  But if you're already into Roguelikes, as charming as Dungeons of Dredmor is, you'll find that once you get a game that survives the first ~4 floors, the game is ultimately just reptetitive and boring.

												This is my favorite dungeon crawling game. It has a humorous fantasy theme that I find endearing. The best part is that going deeper into the game lets you see more items and skills and each one has a joke attached. There are 50+ skill trees and you can pick 7 when you start your character.If you're easily frustrated, this is not a game for you. You will be dying constantly and that's how the game teaches you.  That's really not a problem though because the entire dungeon is randomly generated, so you'll get a different experience each time.There is so much game here for the price that I think you're actually kind of stupid if you don't pick this up. If it looks good to you, don't hesitate. I spent over 300 hours playing and it was worth every penny.			",190,61,0,39,36,0,17

												This is one of the best roguelikes I have ever played, and this is coming from a guy who generally HATES roguelikes. This game is incredibly well designed.Unlike other roguelikes I feel the game actually gives me a leg to stand on and isn't out to screw me from the start. Its fair, something you usually don't hear in the same sentence when it comes to these games. The game wants you to succeed  and it wants you to have a good time.I also love how huge the levels are, I spent about an hour and a half on the FIRST FLOOR! Seriously, I just kept finding new doors to kick open. It also means you will be sufficiently buff for the next level. Seriously, dont blow through them.But in conclusion. While yes this game may not look like much on the outside give it a chance. Its tons of random fun and has charm for days.			",96,24,3,25,8,1,24

												Rogue-like for non-masochistsIt's a beautiful, funny and easy to play rogue-like (turn-based dungeon survival), full of jokes and terrible ways to die. It has options to be played on easier modes than the classic rogue-likes, and has a lot of interesting skills to try, but it is somehow limited on the number of monsters and itens. Playing on ""easy"" (non-hardcore mode) you will probably hoard a lot of powerful itens that you will never use, because you won't need it. Playing on ""hard"" is the same thing, because you will die before you get the chance. Reading the itens description will provide some laughs. Other than that, it's an addictive light-rogue, where you can select the amount of punishment you want to have, so if you are into comical graphical rogue-likes, you may like it.Conclusion:Addictive and satisfying, a rogue-like that makes you laugh and lets you get to the end within less than a lifetime.Positive points:* Beautiful graphics* Very funny item ans skills descriptions* Can be played on ""easy""Negative points:* Not much variation* Lots of useless and repetivive stuff* The final boss is boring			",241,169,4,31,7,0,14

But the boss killed me in a blink.Still a great game. Did I mention you can make a clockwork (steampunk-like) dual-axe weilding pirat?

												The thing about Dredmor is that, on the surface, it's really just an average roguelike, intended to ease people into the genre by featuring colorful graphics and easy controls (with mouse support!).But Dredmor actually does have a few things going for it:- Workshop support.- Witty Dialogue.- Skill Trees (most roguelikes only have a class system, with each only having one specific ability that you're allowed to build on).- Actually being a roguelike, in spite of its goal of easing people into the system.Dredmor's Skills are on a build-as-you-want-it basis, so you can take a magic skill tree and pair it with a warrior skill tree with some (possibly disastrous) degree of efficiency. And with every update adding a few more skills, you can technically play a lot of classes without having to play the same combo ever again.It's also actually a roguelike, compared to ""roguelikes"" like Binding of Isaac (don't get me wrong, that's a fun game, but it's not a roguelike as some people claim it to be), Enter the Gungeon, and so on and so forth.Of course, it wins on Gaslamp's sharp wit department. You might end up chuckling at least once at all the referential humor the game boasts.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dungeons of Dredmor is a rather silly rogue-like with its odd sense of humour, but one with an extreme amount of depth to it. In many ways it is extremely simple to play, with a variety of skills to choose and customize your character with, crafting of various types of items ranging from weapons to armor to consumables, and a huge roster of different enemies to fight.Essentially the game is played by traveling room by room. There are multiple stairways which are used to changed levels, and there are also a plethora of different interactable environmental items, and you also have your personal pocket dimension which you can use to store loot.Primarily what is really good about this game is that it is beginner friendly. While experienced players can also find enjoyment from playing Dungeons of Dredmor, one who has never really experienced what Rogue-like games has to offer will likely be the targeted audience of this game. While other Traditional Rogue-likes will generally be more about attracted players who have already played Rogue-likes, it is rather unique to see a game like Dungeons of Dredmor which seeks to attract players from outside of it.Hats off to this game for that!

												Dungeons of Dredmor is a rogue-like in the vein of similar rogues such as ADOM, TOME, and, the most obvious of them all, Rogue (I am not counting games such as ""The Binding of Isaac"" or ""Risk of Rain"" because I don't believe they have enough elements in them to be considered rogue-likes). Although it may be more accessible than any of those three games that Dredmor is similar to, do not think that this game is a rogue meant only for newbies, for the game equally appeals to those who had previous experience with rogue-likes. In addition to this, the game has a really neat character creation system, as you pick seven skill strees which determine what kind of archtype your character is (and, in turn, determines what kind of stats will be increased the most), as well as give you some skills that will help you kick some monster♥♥♥♥♥ Combine that with a very solid combat system and a catchy soundtrack, and you got yourself a good rogue. Now if the humor wasn't mainly pop culture references/memes and the game wasn't extremely buggy, it would be even better			",139,29,1,38,5,0,13

Basic InformationTitle: Dungeons of DredmorGenre: Casual, Indie, RPGDeveloper: Gaslamp Games, Inc.Publisher: Gaslamp Games, Inc.	Release Date: 13 Jul, 2011Basic OverviewDungeons of Dredmor is a very intresting and very different from other Rogue-like RPGs I have played in the past. This game has randomly generated levels, along with loads of skills that you can mix and match to your liking. This adds very high replay value to the game, which is what you would expect from a (optional) perma-death game. It's sometimes frustrating to be killed by an enemy when you've spent to long on a play through, but that's to be expected from a perma-death run of this game.Game playThis game has a lot of variation, whether it's randomly generated floors or a huge amount of skills to choose from. Each run is very different from the last. I found myself dying a lot when I first started playing it, but the I kept coming back for just 'one more run.' Then that one more run turned into two or maybe three. The game really pulls you in, it has a great atmosphere when playing it on Perma-death. You never know what's going to happen which makes you more alert for what can happen, maybe you will find a monster zoo and then you have to be careful. There is a wide variety of different enemies for each floor, and each floor has a different theme to it with specific enemies that you will encounter along the way. As for the weapons and classes there is a nice variety for them as well which gives you a better attack damage for a specific weapon type and will depend with what happen you start off with. But what makes this game even more unique is that you can substitute a weapon class for another skill that may or may not be better. You can make the game even more difficult on yourself if the hardest difficulty is too easy for you by having skills that aren't very helpful to you. There are so many traps, and levers that you have no idea what it will activate. Maybe it will open a door, or maybe it'll teleport you to somewhere else. That's the beauty of this game. The attack system is turn-based, so you move once then the enemies move. It can be a simple point and click or you can use WSAD for moving your character, then attacking is just simple being close to the enemy (if you use a melee weapon) and clicking on them to take it in turns to attack.Score (Out of 10): 10 - Very high replay value and variation!Sound & MusicThe music for this game is perfectly fitting for the atmosphere and the game play for this game. Although it can get a little bit repetitive it's still nice to listen to when you are fighting a bunch of enemies at once. The sounds of each thing that you use, such as swinging your sword or axe is all very unique. It is quite obvious that the developers put a lot of time and effort into creating the sounds for each things. I would like to see some more music in this game that matches the atmosphere of the game.Score (Out of 10): 9 - Would like to see some more music that fits the atmosphereGraphics/Art StyleFor me the art style of this game is just perfect. It really fits in with the with the whole atmosphere and dungeons kind of feel. It's not a too series style of art, but then again it doesn't look innocent. It just fits perfectly with the whole gaming experience. Some people might not like it because of the cartoon kind of style to it, but I am just saying it from what I think.Score (Out of 10): 10 - My own personal opinion, you might not like the art styleConclusionSo there is my whole review for this game, it's a very unique type of rogue-lite RPG game. It has very high repay value which always makes you come back to the game. It has great atmospheric music, I would only want to see a few more soundtracks on this game, and the art style, well take it or leave it. You'll either love it or you'll hate it.For more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Lot's O Giveaway's curator group here.

												Note: my play time doesn't reflect my countless playthroughs. I can't even fathom the hours I've poured into this on rainy days.PROS:* As roguelike as roguelike can get. Sometimes RNG will bite you in the butt, but sometimes the dice are nice. For the most part though, it's pretty forgiving, at least early on. Most of the time it's just a matter of picking a couple skills that can reliably get you through the first few floors, and by that time you'll have enough levels (and lucky loot) to keep on climbing.* Maintains an upbeat, quirky, and tastefully humorous tone in the music, dialog and flavor text, all of which belie the treacheries of the Dungeons.* Mods galore! More rooms in floors, more classes with unique effects that are (usually) balanced, check out the Steam Workshop and see if anything tickles your fancy, there's plenty to choose from. CONS:* Very bulky crafting system, with an equally bulky UI to go with it. More often than not, you're better off praying to RNGesus than trying to amass the skill levels and materials for some recipe you found. Ironically, the game itself makes fun of how bulky its crafting system is, one joke I did not smile at.Overall, if you like roguelikes even in the slightest, this is a must-have in your library. Get it, play it on hard with perma-death, get really far, die, get frustrated, shut it off, then come back because you *know* you want some more of that sweet Dredmor punishment.

												Extremely fun and extremely addicting!  This game takes a humorous approach to the dungeon crawler while at the same time keeping your interest the entire time through a complex and unique skill tree levelling up system.  You will die repeatedly while playing this game but the allure of starting over never seems to fade as every time you start a character they can be completely unique from the last!Another awesome game with impressive longevity from the Indie community!

												Dungeons of Dredmors is a game that captures the esscence of ""rogue"" games without overcomplicating things. In esscence a game of luck and chance, and dealing with that potentially poor luck. This makes it fun, maybe even a bit unpredictable if you will. Of course like any other game it can drain a lot playing, as it is tedious at times. This is due to how it ultimately (sadly) utalizes a system where unless you chose to be hoplessly aggresive, will lead to the unenevitable level grind. Of course the option is there for it to be otherwise, but that only applies to people who know when/how to back out of risky situations. Moving on their are more things that can make it tedious. The amount of stats is quite large. This isn't going to give it a negative mark though. Every stat works off of a basic system of x+y-q bladabladabla. Overall they're simple for everacheivers who actually care. For people who don't it categorizes them into different major skills, and gives helpful advice as to which role should invest in it.

												""Curse you diggles! I hate this stupid game, I'm so fed up of dieing! Although, one more try wouldn't hurt ...""Another roguelike with the one-more-life addiction working for it. Dungeons of Dredmor ticks a lot of boxes for me. I love the art and the sound and think it works fantastically together. I haven't even scratched the surface of the Steam Workshop for this game, which will potentially add hundreds more hours of fun to it. What DoD does best, is it makes me engage with my characters journey. I'm likely to stay alive in DoD for a few hours, and this makes me attached to what I've achieved so far and makes me want that character to be victorious. Alas, they rarely are. They often meet their end in some embarrassing way, to an enraged Diggle or something (sidenote - I really want a Diggle plushie. That would rock). Just writing about DoD makes me want to play more!This game is superb for it's price. Play it on Permadeath for the best experience.			",1315,465,45,230,179,17,254

If you don't think you can take the frustration of defeat at the hands of Lord Dredmor and have to start all over again from the first floor, you can always disable the permadeath feature and play this like a casual.Pros:- Sick sense of humor, congratulating you on your death and many more funny stuff that you'll encounter in the dungeon.- Vast amount of skill selection with countless combination plus steamworkshop = great replayability- DigglesCons:- My dungeoneering skill does not help me in playing this game.

												Dungeons of Dredmor is hilarious. It's a fresh take on the reemerging ""rogue-like"" genre. The game is a balanced mixture of old and new. Although turn-based, the gameplay moves quickly and is challenging. What's more, the humor is spot-on.The only possible downside is a small, but steep learning curve. You're left to learn from your failures, of which there will be many. This may or may not be a negative, depending on personal preference.Overall, a great game well worth its price of admission.

												Simple, fun, easy-to-learn roguelike perfect for people looking to get their feet wet in the genre but who are looking for a simpler experience. The persistent sense of humor is what really sets it apart, with everything from mobs to skills to item descriptions having some ridiculous pun or reference thrown in that keeps things light-hearted throughout. While I will say that there are certainly some issues regarding balance of skills and easy abuse of AI mechanics, the game is for the most part well balanced and definitely polished, and definitely worth the asking price.

												This is one of the best dungeon crawlers I've ever played. The amount of content you get for just a few dollars is incredible, and 800 hours later I still find myself learning new things. The humor is goofy and fresh, there's tons and tons of skill combinations, and for once, it's an RPG with a crafting system which is actually pretty interesting. Dredmor is simple enough so that people of any background can easily jump into it and have fun, but there are also difficulty levels for all sorts of players, and enough depth to challenge you as you progress.I've been playing this game for several years now, and it is by far the best purchase I've made on Steam. The community surrounding Dredmor has also been incredibly friendly and helpful, and a wide range of mods doesn't hurt, either.			",176,75,4,39,17,0,26

												Many a time I have guaged a game's quality based on how much I think the game should be worth, and how much the devs are chargin for it. For example, the game 1000000. It is a cheap game, sold at a cheap price. And then take BL Pre-sequal, a game that arguably charges more than the content it provides is worth. However, Dungeons of Dredmor has presented me with the rare privalege of saying that this game is worth more than the asking price. Since purchasing and playing many a game, over many an hour, I am happily willing to say that, if it were demanded of me, I would have payed 15$ for this game. Maybe even 20$. That is how much it is worth to me. Any many of my friends agreed with me. Many of their first words of reaction were ""You got this for HOW MUCH?!"". And so I present to you Dungeons of Dredmor, a game that, for some reason, feels the need to make you pay but a fraction of the game's true value. Buy it, and buy it now.			",196,35,2,30,23,4,34

												Honestly, there aren't many meaningful challenges in the game. Most enemies are incredibly easy. Most gameplay is wandering around identical rooms in the dungeon trying to find better equipment or crafting ingredients. Most combat is standing on the same tile, waiting for the next monster to walk up to you so you can defeat it in 1 or 2 swings. Crafting would be fun if inventory management were easier. The skills are funny, but they don't add a whole lot to the game.			",27,8,0,18,1,1,2

												Dungeons of Dredmor is a roguelike. For those of us who are not elite(ist) gamers, just think of it as a hard hack-and-slash game with procedurally generated content and very real risk of permanent death which forces you to start over (a little wiser each time)My initial impression of this game was a very positive one. It's very easy to get into, has a lot of skills to choose from for character creation (implying lots of replayability, but I was wrong) and it covers everything with a layer of clever tongue-in-cheek humor (like witty pop culture references? this game has lots!)However after playing this game on a netbook for over 80 hours, properly experiencing it in all its glory, I stand corrected enough to say that I would not recommend this game to someone else looking to derive some fun out of their play sessions, unless their entertainment consists in dying over and over unfairly...case in which I probably still wouldn't recommend this game because it simply isn't that good all things considered.First off, a major technical issue. This game is built poorly, seemingly by dwarven plasticsmiths (those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s) It's a little 2D game with sprites that have 2 animations each. Still it actively takes 600MB of RAM, reserving even more than that. On my 2GB RAM netbook I can forget running this and a browser at the same time. Shame, because it looks like exactly the type of game to be played on a netbook/tablet, and not on a proper desktop configuration like the game demands. It also personally annoys me as this seems to be a problem with more and more lazy pixel-style indie games: games that look like they were made 20 years ago demand 4GB RAM and 1GB VRAM. What the hell?Onto the gameplay itself. It's balls hard. Not in a good way as it seemed on first glance. It's unfairly and frustratingly hard. It's unfair because while you have an ample amount of skills to choose from, only a few are actually effective (give you a high likelyhood of winning the game) while others are downright useless. The same goes for weapons (don't use crossbows unless you like taking 4x longer than a character with his bare hands to win the game). This wouldn't be so bad, as every such game has some strategies that work better than others, but this game in particular is very stingy with its descriptions of mechanics. Without reading a guide, you will frequently encounter weapons and abilities whose actual effects are very underwhelming compared to what their descriptions would have you believe. You pretty much have to read a guide before diving into the game, or you'll frequently wonder ""what does THAT mean"" when finding, say, an artifact or another with a typical description like ""The honorable poodles - it is studded with cheese crust and decorated with high quality tin""Once that's out of the way, and you finally have a good understanding of the game mechanics that let you create an effective character with a fair chance of winning...you will run into another problem. Basically, once you figure out how to not die, everything all the way up until the final boss becomes one relatively simple, mindless, long-winded repetitive grind. And the final boss? FUBAR, because even many good builds won't scratch that guy (hints: Magical Law, Burglary, Crossbow, crafting/encrusting in general). A situation in which 99% of the game play is mindless faceroll, and that 1% (final boss) has the shot of taking it all away because of RNG is not fun (again, unless you're a difficulty fetishist). I also have to ask myself why they even made the game with 51 skills to choose from when less than 15 of those are actually going to let you win the game. Could it be that in spite of first impressions, this is not that good of a game?			",205,46,4,32,11,3,28

												Have you ever wondered what it would be like to have a Rogue-like developed by a team of roughly 10 people who grew up in the mid 90s and were raised entirely by Doom and The Secret of Monkey Island? Of course you don't, that's pretty weird.Fortunately it exists and it is probably one of the best ""true"" rogue-like games made in the past 10 years.What is it?Dungeons of Dredmor is a Roguelike Fantasy RPG with several pop culture references from the 90s up to the 2010s.If you are unsure of what a Rogue-like is[en.wikipedia.org], it's a gameplay style based on the 1980 release ""Rogue"". In a nutshell, you are given one life to complete the entire game, any death results in a save wipe or a sentence back to the start of the game. As such the game itself is relatively shorter than other RPGs, maybe 2-3 hours with experienced players.In the more traditional rogue-likes, like this game, you move in a square based grid and take turns with the enemies to either pick up one of the 20 or so types of cheeses, find new gear to equip, or die horribly to one of the many monsters in your way.Controls to this game are rather simple, move in a grid based map with WASD and use the mouse to interact with objects next to the player. However, I very much recommend turning off mouse movement. It sounds nice at first, but as far as I know you cannot cancel any mouse movement queues. So if you are suddenly ambushed, you have to take a good 3 turns just to move to the spot you clicked. Which is very bad.Long story short, this is a very difficult game for newcomers to rogue-likes or even intermediate players who understand most of the things. If you really like the concept of this game and must play it first rather than others, thankfully you can lower the difficulty and disable permanent deaths. And it doesn't even make fun of you for it!I highly recommend the tutorial even if you know what you're doing, it's humorous and gives you a good idea of how to play (character numbers good, hp good, damage bad). Further help can be found in this guide that i totally didn't pick because it is only the top rated one: 


Beginner's Guide 
A Guide for Dungeons of Dredmor
By: arbor day

			A collection of some basic information to help get you started, and things I wish I had known the first time I played the game. This guide is a work-in-progress.		


If you want a more casual rogue-like experience to ease into the realm of insanity, I’d recommend trying the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon series of games from Spike Chunsoft for Nintendo DS/3DSIf you want a harder, more confusing, and actively update rogue-like; try Dwarf Fortress Adventure Mode[www.bay12games.com] (good luck)My ExperienceI've ""started"" playing this game maybe 4 years ago when I received it in a Humble Bundle. I played it, died, got angry, died again, and wrote it off as a bad game. Since then I have learned that there can be fun found in losing as well as winning. So, About a few weeks ago I picked it back up and tried to beat it again.As I am writing this (August 14th, 2016), I have yet to complete the game in its entirety, let alone the DLC which extends the game even further. I have met my inevitable demise about 20 times over the years i played this off steam and even now. I plan to make it to the end on my own accord on Normal with Permadeath on, even if it takes me another 4 years.Price Point?5 years ago this game released for an almost unheard-of price point of $5, it is still $5 because you can't really lower it anymore than this. They eventually added 3 DLCs. 2 for $3 and 1 for absolutely free! (under the caveat that you have to give it a name). Since then the made a complete edition bundle for $7, which is obviously the best choice in this scenario.Sales of this game are somewhat common, roughly once every 2-3 months for 50%, with it having a deep discount of 75% at one point.Game Updates?On April 1st, 2012, the devs ""announced""[www.gaslampgames.com] that they would be making a sequel to this game. In 3D with the inclusion of Microtransactions and Social Media postings.As of August 2012, after the release of the third dlc, the devs have no longer added content to this game and moved onto other projects.Thankfully the game has native steam workshop mod support, so you can add a set of items, skills, or re-sprites to add more to the game. Of course there won't be many mod developers for such a small game as this, but there are quite a few at least.Is it worth buying?Yes. If you like the humor from Monkey Island, the gameplay styles of any ""true"" rogue-like, or even want to try one for the first time. Definitely pick this title up, even if it's not on sale.(You're spending maybe $3.50 extra, that's like half the price of a fast food meal for 2)(Also, hilariously enough, there actually is a Doom roguelike)[en.wikipedia.org] ",423,96,10,47,36,4,50

												Dungeons of Dredmor is a very fun Rouge-Like Dungeon crawler. Gameplay:If you just begin the game you might be confused at how the skills work. They are all very unique and sometimes confusing, but you can test these out and monsters and find out what happens, so that isn't a real problem. Gameplay is great, Gaslamp nailed the Rouge-like formula and add some fun quirks. Monsters taunt you in a variety of fashions, Ranging from strange to one that made me kill the taunting monster in the worst way possible. GraphicsVisuals are good and unique, they can look a bit dated, but other than that they are unique and enjoyable.Sfx:Sound is really where I have issue with the game. I like the sfx, but the music is repetitive and annoying. Overall:It is a great game that I would suggest you pick up, and the DLC since it is worth the money.			",944,298,23,123,93,13,182

												A crazy mash-up roguelike that aims to be approachable but still have a huge sprawling dungeon to explore.And by and large it succeeds - few debilitating badstats, abilities much more easy to understand, and the lightening effects of humor to make losing a little more fun. It doesn't quite have the quick loop times of your action roguelikes or your purpose-built Sproggiwoods, and even in No Time To Grind mode can be quite draining.So a medium-weight roguelike, then. If you've had good experiences with other roguelikes you can beat the dungeon in an hour and want the next step up in complexity, this is a pretty good step.			",102,47,1,54,18,0,23

												Why do I recomend this game? Because it plays really like a rogue RPG. You don't have traditional classes, instead skill trees that add spells, skills or passive skills to your character. You'll find a lot of eastereggs (references to other games or movies in this game), some of which make you laugh. And the game is even on lowest level a tough nut. Furthermore it has decent retro style graphics and a good playability, it is nice to be beaten up by a Diggle.			",1554,811,52,244,215,11,265

Of course magic included. if you are a fan of games with sarcastic humor, this game is full of funny jokes that make you laugh, but of couse you must pay attention to the details of the room to catch them.

Every last one of them has had their save lost or corrupted after the game crashed. Every one. I tried playing without mods, I tried flushing steam cloud, I tried disabling steam cloud entirely, both from steam and the xml file. I want to rant about this and give them a big thumbs down, and yet-How many other games could keep me coming back to make a new character after these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t crashes?			",552,195,16,80,48,5,91

												I should sue everyone involved with the making of this game. Allowing it to be sold for a measly $5 is simply villainous, my friends. Don't let my Steam playtime deceive you, this game gave me many hours of enjoyment while unable to connect to the mmo's I typically play due to no internet. In times of such darkness, I turn to Dungeons of Dredmor. Below I will explain this game's pure awesomeness.Pros+ Large amount of skills, each varying, humorous and genuinely useful. You choose seven skills to use at the start of the game, then choose which you invest in which essentially allows you to create your own class with its own skill-trees+ Fitting artstyle and music+ Hilarious, un-matched humor that is always refreshing and never (seriously), never gets old. SKOL! LUTEFISK FOR THE LUTEFISK GOD!! Also that noise the diggle makes when it comes up out of the ground. Sort of a ""doodoodaDUUU!"" that's so damn cute :3+ Randomly generated dungeon every time with just enough pre-made rooms and events to keep things interesting + ^ that and the numerous skills give this game an absurd amount of replay value that goes well beyond an investment of 5 bucks +Very moddable, with tons of great mods already available on the workshopCons- I don't know, you're part of the Diggle Rights Movement? No real cons, honestly, and for 5 bucks who caresNow that we've got that out of the way, let's talk expansions. Each of the expansions add more skills, all of which are hilarious, not to mention some of the funnest in the game (Communism skill seriously rocks) and are both totally worth 3 bucks if you dig the game as much as I do. Also, free expansion? Say what!? (I named mine March of the Diggles, by the way)  In all, if you like roguelikes, buy this game. Actually, if you like games in general just buy it. It's five bucks and I've probably got more enjoyment out of this little indie title than I did in Skyrim.TL;DR VERSION: Infinite hours of fun for five dollars. 10/10 Krong Anvils.

												Although it's a-lot simpler than Angband, NETHACK, ADOM, and other reknown, much older rogue-likes. Dungeons of Dredmor is a very humorous, fun, and simple rogue-like on it's own. It has a very interesting class system, and should be played on GRPD (Hardest Difficulty, and Perma-death) if you want the full rogue-like experience. The only problems with the game are the crashes, and the corrupted saves. I had no problem with these problems after I nuked Steam-cloud though.			",70,13,0,15,4,1,13

												It's a damn fun game with a fun sense of humor. Graphics are good so your eyes aren't bleeding from looking at the screen. Music is great. Some skills are broken while others are underpowered, but that's just the nature of the game. RNG can make or break you but most of the time you're fine as long as you play cautiously. The game also doubles as a great way to introduce people to the Roguelike genre.Main con is its instability from time to time. Could use a bit more work on the backend but Gaslamp Games has since moved on to solely working on Clockwork Empires, so don't expect it anytime in the near future (or at all, but never say never!)

												This game is definitely something you can sink alot of time into. Being able to customize your character with a mix of different skills every run brings in alot of combinations, and adds to the replayability value of the game. the game uses a very odd, yet satisfying sense of humor, and alot of references can be found throughout the game as well. There is no real story to follow, but that's pretty common for roguelikes. I will say it can feel slightly repetitive, especially once you find a set of skills that work well together or you feel you suits your play style. It's only $5, so I don't see any reason not to buy it. I was definitely hesitant to buy this just after looking at the screenshots, but I have no regrets now.Definitely recommended to anyone who enjoys roguelikes.Beware Diggle Hell, and be prepared to press space bar alot. (I would also recommend Tales of Maj'Eyal to anyone who has already played through Dungeons of Dredmor. TOME is like a much more hardcore and in-depth version of Dredmor with even lower graphics quality. Fair warning though, you may not like it as much as Dredmor.)  ",80,16,0,13,8,1,10

The author has obviously spent many meticulous hours creating and refining the many monsters, items, and skill trees available in this game, as well as keeping the overhanging satyrical theme that is so very present in every aspect in this game. I completely recommend this game for anyone - it appeals to players whether they are in for a hardcore dungeon crawl or simply playing to enjoy themselves and have a good laugh at the cleverly sarcastic item descriptions.8.5/10.

												Soooo... Dungeons of Dredmor. This game is a rogue-like (one of my favorite genres) so it's different from games like The Binding of Isaac, FTL (Rogue-lite) and it has most of his gameplay features present in the 1980 game Rogue like turn-based combat, randomized levels on a level structure and permadeath (you can disable it). But the game adds many more features like the possibility to personalize the character with different skill trees instead of a classic class system.The graphics are good but after a while it may bore the eyes but it's still better than ASCII graphics.The music is meh, some tracks are good like the tutorial one but the others sounds like the cat of the composer got on the keyboard and started jamming the keys.Overall the game is one of the best rogue-like that i've played even with all the little defects and i love it and the workshop adds that cherry on the top of the cakeFinal Vote 8/10P.S. Someone complains that the game crashes often with the autosave feature, it never happened to me but remember to save often.			",169,24,3,15,11,1,16

Originally I wasn't going to buy this game, due to the graphics and interface. Then the first time I played it I didn't like it, whatsoever. Then I completed the tutorial, watched a YouTube video about it, went back in and played again... Drowned, got electrocuted, died from acid burning my throat, attacked by various strange looking creatures and throughly enjoyed my time playing. This is the start of my epic journey to complete this game, buy the game. It's great. Trust me.			",125,15,3,10,16,0,12

												If you haven't gotten this game already, then why the hell not?! This game is cheap, insanely replayable and just pure fun. Fans of dungeon crawlers such as FATE will love this (I know I do.) With a wide variety of skills, weaponry and armour complete with random and amusing names that are randomly generated, Dungeons of Dredmor is an amazing turn-based RPG game and I defy anyone to not enjoy this game for at least a few hours. It also has steam workshop, so if you get bored of the ""vanilla"" aspects of the game you can subcribe to a multitude of equally as amazing mods that make you want to go back to the game over and over again. BUY IT NOW.			",232,68,2,56,15,1,20

												If you're looking for a Rogue-Like game that is full of mentions of other games, series, movies and nerdy stuff, (for example Doom, Doctor Who, 300, Warhammer Fantasy) then this is your game. Game is tough and proves enough of a challenge at first, but once you get a good skill combo and get the hunch of the skills and abilities, you can get pretty far. I've done 20+ runs and only once managed to kill Lord Dredmor.Also the steam workshop offers some nice user-made mods that bring in more content to the game (I enjoy the new rooms especially, since the old ones get kinda boring after a while)Also, this game is dirt cheap.

												Yesterday i've played a couple of indie games and today i've decided to continue my way through indie-games-jungle lol. This time my choice fall on Dungeons of Dredmor. I can say that this game is quite interesting in explore way. It looks like the Binding of Isaac exactly same. I don't know why but i'm really into this game. Anyway i'll try to make my way to the end of those dungeons but right now i can say only my two favourite words: ""strongly recommended!"".happy new year btw lol :D			",430,96,17,46,33,2,63

												This is a good game. It is fairly easy and accessable for a roguelike (but still much more difficult than most modern games), and the graphics are some of the best in the genre.The trouble with it is that there are much better, free, roguelikes out there like Brogue (for novices) and Z+angband (for hardcore gamers). So if you really need the nice graphics, go ahead and buy it... but otherwise you're better off just installing Brogue. ",404,137,13,41,55,6,68

												I can't remember when I bought this, but I got the Diggle Nog cheevo for the 2011 Winter Sale event, so that could say something.  It took about three years of hiatus and 107 hours to finally kill Dredmor...once.  On Easy (and Permadeath).Dredmor is a roguelike, and I think it's a pretty good introduction to the genre since I've not really played many of them.  You start out by picking from three difficulties, if you want your character to be permanently deleted when he/she dies or not, and if you bought the Realm of the Diggle Gods expansion, if you want to have 10 or 15 floors.  From there, you're given a page full of skills and you're to pick seven to make your character build, as opposed to having set classes like Warrior or Battlemage or whatnot--or you can just pick Random and see how that does.  And then you're given your choice of cosmetic gender, you name your character, and you're sent on your merry way.Everything is laid out on a grid and every time you move or attack uses up a turn, where everything else is allowed to move or attack.  You can quite literally stand with enemies surrounding you and nothing will happen until you do something.  You level up with enough EXP by killing enemies, destroying Dredmor statues, or unlocking doors/chests with lockpicks.  When you level up, you recover all HP/MP, and you're given your choice of your seven skills to raise which will influence how your stats increase.  Skills work on a linear tree system, but you're allowed to raise your skills in any order, between raising them all up evenly or maxing one as soon as possible.  Every skill in every tree does something, be it simply raising your stats by a set amount or giving you interesting new spells or moves or powers.Combat is pretty much ""hit it until it dies"" if you're going melee, but every character can use crossbows provided they have ammo and wands as long as they have charges, no matter what build you went with.  Some enemies use long-ranged spells too, so it's a matter of using what you have to counter their threat.  Monsters typically don't show up en masse during the game except in Monster Zoos, big rooms where mooks and minibosses pretty much Zerg Rush you.  You don't necessarily have to clear them out, but you get a free item for wiping everything out, and it's a lot of EXP, too.  You also get free items for doing sidequests gained by praying at the Inconsequentia statues scattered through the dungeons.  They're pretty basic quests--kill this enemy/group, retrieve an item, use this item on a special statue, etc.  I think Dredmor is a pretty fair game in terms of difficulty.  If you die, it's almost always your fault.  Died to a trap?  You carelessly marched forward without enough Trap Sight Radius.  Fight an enemy to where the point both of you are near-death and you miss, dying to its attack?  You didn't heal yourself, retreat, try to lead it into traps, etc.  Of course, this game is randomly-generated so you can quite easily end up with a bad draw on items and stuff, but one draw of roguelikes isn't the game giving you the tools needed to win, but winning with the tools you're given.  No one game is unwinnable if you keep your wits about you and don't get complacent.  The expansions...well, expand.  RotDG adds monsters, skills, items, five more floors; YHTNTEP adds more monsters, items, skills; CotW adds even more monsters and skills and items, but also adds new floors apart from the main dungeon on top of a customizable safe zone (though the base game has a basic version of this place).  There are also quite a few mods on Steam and not on Steam that add more of the above and with things like additional room layouts and so on, but some may require some or all of the expansions, so watch for that.  So yeah, TL;DR I would really recommend this game.  If you're new to roguelikes, this is a pretty good place to start.  Easy mode is pretty easy, hard is pretty damned hard, but that all depends on how the RNG treats you and how you build your characters.  There are a lot of achievements here...though a lot of them require you to die to various critters.  But you know what they say:  Dying is fun!			",519,139,12,130,27,8,81

												Dungeons of Dredmor is a rogue-like dungeon crawler. On first glance, it seems pretty basic and generic as there are so many games with the same genre. However, Dungeons of Dredmor manages to stand out from the rest with it's wide array of skills, items, floors and monsters, it's humor, and how much fun you have playing it. Dungeons of Dredmor has you as a hero to defeat Dark Lord Dredmor. On you quest to defeat Dredmor, you will need weapons, armor and a brain to slaughter monsters across the 10 dungeon floors. DoD has you start off with you picking from about 30 skills (Excluding Deadshot which was removed) and you have the freedom to choose whatever you like. It's a great sense of replayability that is added this way. You can mix and match different skills to see what you like as a player and various skills change your playstyle.. If you happen to mix to certain skills together, you may come up with an amazing combination to destroy some enemies. When you've picked your skills, you get spawned on the first floor. It's good to note that every floor is randomly generated and that the game is turn-based, allowing you to strategize your next move.Now as you progress through the game, different items will be there to enhance your character through different stats, I won't go into detail though. While the same items do pop up on occasion, they feel different because the stats and it's name is always different. Killing enemies will give you XP and will eventually get you to LVL up, therefore giving you one skill point to give you a passive or active skill. As I've said before, the game's large variety increases how much you play. DoD also has a surprising in-depth crafting system that will let you make better weapons, armor and various items like food and potions. DoD also has DLC, which is a must buy. It only enhances the game that's already worth your money.The DLC's add more skills, items, floors and balances the game in general. There is also a decent sized workshop community, constantly added mods to make the game better. Overall, Dungeons of Dredmor is an amazing buy. It's challenging with the option of Permadeath and it really makes you think in a lot of situations. For anyone who loves rouge-likes, you must check this game out. PROS:+Fun and Addicting+Charming+Humorous+Wide Array of Skills+Hundreds of Items+Challenging+Excellent Soundtrack+Permadeath Option+Deep Crafting System+DLC enhances and balances the Base Game+100+ Achievements+Steam Workshop+Bang for Your BuckCONS:-Graphical Style may not be your taste (Grew on me) -Other players have been known to lose their progress-Items don't change character appearance.DUNGEONS OF DREDMOR: 9.5/10			",211,27,8,26,23,3,16

												Roguelikes too daunting for you? Can't remember if you drink potions by hitting ""P"" for potion or ""Q"" for quaff potion? Introducing Dungeons of Dredmor with its revolutionary gameplay system: Having actual graphics!Jokes aside, Dredmor is addictively clever and humorous. Half the fun is blazing your way through the dungeons to see how far you can get; the other half is learning intricasies such as: ""just because you have the option to drink something does not mean you should"" or ""A bolt of mass destruction does exactly what you would hope it would do"".

												Goofy and loads of fun. I haven't gotten terribly far yet as I'm not very good but I am not quitting until I beat it at least once! This game does not take itself seriously so if you're looking for a rogue with a somber atmosphere this isn't it.If you're looking for a game that rewards you with taunts for your mistakes (playfully) and has achievements for just about every misstep you can make so you can look back fondly on all your ill-advised choices, this is it.I don't usually like these kinds of games as I find them too obtuse for my enjoyment but this one has something special about it.Maybe it's the massive eyebrows.

												Missing alot of strategy elements and decisions. Very simplified. If feels like the Munchkin version  of what was supposed to be a roguelike. There is a difference between random for the sake of random and an engine designed to be random but with plenty of modifiers and things that affect outcomes and many solutions for every problem. When you die rarely is it because of an element of the game that you didnt understand properly or something that could have been stopped or modified if you had taken the proper steps to prevent it. If you want a good true roguelike from the steam store buy Tales of Maj'eyal or Vulture for nethack(nethack is free so are most of the tile sets, but vulture has a GUI and mouse controls so its easier to play without having to remember the 40-60 commands for nethack). The Nethack engine is by far the most in depth classic roguelike engine on steam even though its over 20 years old. Or get Wazhack for a different style of rogue			",247,52,9,38,39,2,44

												It's an ok game after its said and done.  If you're looking for decent rogue-like for its price, this is it.  If you seek something more hardcore, look elsewhere.Edit:  To the dislikers, there's Nethack, Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, and Tales of Maj'Eyal just to name a few examples of games better than this.  They're also free, have more content, ard are more challenging in general.  At best, this game is for those who don't want to learn how to play any of the aforementioned games.  This isn't a bad game, but IMO its lacking.			",291,55,4,50,13,2,22

												As a fan of the old Rouge-alike games years ago, I find Dungeons of Dredmore to have a familiar 'feel' about it. The sheer amount of items, and crafting ability you have makes the game entertaining on its own. Add to that the random skill generation (you can choose these specifically too) and what you have is a thoroughly addictive game that almost anyone would enjoy! It takes a couple hours to get used too, but its so worth it :)			",161,66,10,50,24,1,20

												This game serves as an excellent example of how something can be ""dinky"" and still good. There are all sorts of ""rogue-like"" and ""rogue-lite"" games on Steam nowadays, and this is certainly among the best.You're basically a person with some customized build of your choosing going through a dungeon with the goal of becoming more powerful and slaying some guy. The story is comical and background noise at best, and the real strength of the game is in exploration and advancement.The one flaw in this game is the art style. Obviously, the graphics are very low tech, but there is a difference between ""good"" low tech (Shovel knight, Braid, etc) and ""bad"" low tech, and this, albeit barely, falls into the bad. Everything around you kinda looks vomit-colored and some of the monsters blend in with the scenery so well that they look like furniture. If it weren't for the fact that items ""sparkled"" when on the ground, you'd really have no way of knowing the difference between a new pair of boots and a corpse. Dob't get me wrong; it's not the worst looking game in the world by any means, but it could easily be made better.In short, this game is cheap and goes on sale a fair bit. It's perfectly for when you've got some spare time at work and things are slow, so you should look to add it to your library when you get the chance.			",2088,759,56,251,223,20,316

												I am not a big fan of rouge-likes. All the step-based, dungeon romping, death filled games usually tire me out.But not so with Dungeons Of Dredmore. After giving it some time, I grew to like step based movement and combat, and exploring a randomly generated dungeon really gets the adventuring spirit riled up inside of me. The game is great, and you'll have hours of fun if you do get it.Though, one word of advice: Have a spell or potion handy to jump over channels/canals of water. Cause my character is currently stuck on an island after drinking a random teleportation potion. I guess it's time to start a new game...			",743,217,24,86,101,12,90

												A simple rougue-like. For those who don't know, that basically means randomized dungeons and loot, a somewhat punishing difficulty, and when you die you die. Those who are deep fans of the genre may tell you about all the options that are better on gameplay, and that Dredmor is coasting on the pretty visuals (well, pretty for a roguelike). They're right, but it doesn't matter. Dredmor is still a great fun game in its own right, and a good introduction to the genre if you find yourself enjoying the style of gameplay. 5/5			",2087,884,76,270,298,28,379

It was the first of the now 390 games I've purchased on Steam and I still play it. I mean it - if you want to have a loot-heavy dungeon searching adventure, look NO further.			",441,100,7,62,29,0,60

												Dungeons of Dredmor is a roguelike game that is considered really hard by indie game critics. I think this game is amazing and is actually one of the best games I have ever played. This game is also really funny (everyone who has played will agree on that.) It also has an amazing soundtrack, which the tracks come on at the right times to give you a sense of emersion in the world. I highly recommend this game to people who like the Binding of Isaac. Think of another roguelike (Brogue) and mix it with a funny game (Super Meat Boy.) I give this game a 10/10.If you want a satirical review:I got humped to death 10/10			",199,55,1,17,11,2,8

												When my friends told me I needed to go kill a dark lord, I thought it was the shrooms talking. Turns out it wasn't. I woke up in a dungeon, the way out was locked, and there are drill-faced hell penguins everywhere. And mushrooms, all over the place.Mushrooms? I got this.By the time I hit the 15th floor, Lord Dredmor is waiting for me. Me? I'm high as a kite, tripping puffballs, I've got spores coming out of my pores, swinging swords and lips drenched with blood. Some crazy bottle of hooch I found back on the 7th floor brought me into harmony with the stars, man, so I'm stellar. I look into Dredmor's dead eyes and stuff a handful of shrooms into my face.Coward knows he's in over his head, and teleports away. Aw, hell.I blast my way through the entire bottom floor, a fungal lady of death, killing everything that moves, but the jerk isn't there. What the hell, Dredmor? How rude is it to hide from your guests? I grind up some shrooms and rub the powder in my eyes and realize, damn, these walls are hollow. One Bolt of Mass Destruction flushes Dredmor out, he's not casting cause I revoked his license, he's running cause the shroom girl is screaming, he's stuck, he's got a Holy Hand Grenade on his face, boom.And the diggles said my degree in dungeoneering means nothing here.

												Very specific  RPG. I finished it and therefore I think, I like it. First 5-6 dungeon levels (about half of the game) was challenging. I constantly found new stuff (item, spells, etc.). However second half of the game was boring. It was the same over and over again. Maybe I was too powerful (promethean magic seems unbalanced to me). I rushed through just to kill final boss. By the way the fight was way too easy. So overall I am little bit disapointed. I rate it avarage. It is possible, that I don't understand this game. It should be something like rouge like, or whatever. So if you know what that mean go for it.			",122,45,0,14,5,1,16

												This game serves as an excellent example of how something can be ""dinky"" and still good. There are all sorts of ""rogue-like"" and ""rogue-lite"" games on Steam nowadays, and this is certainly among the best.You're basically a person with some customized build of your choosing going through a dungeon with the goal of becoming more powerful and slaying some guy. The story is comical and background noise at best, and the real strength of the game is in exploration and advancement.The one flaw in this game is the art style. Obviously, the graphics are very low tech, but there is a difference between ""good"" low tech (Shovel knight, Braid, etc) and ""bad"" low tech, and this, albeit barely, falls into the bad. Everything around you kinda looks vomit-colored and some of the monsters blend in with the scenery so well that they look like furniture. If it weren't for the fact that items ""sparkled"" when on the ground, you'd really have no way of knowing the difference between a new pair of boots and a corpse. Dob't get me wrong; it's not the worst looking game in the world by any means, but it could easily be made better.In short, this game is cheap and goes on sale a fair bit. It's perfectly for when you've got some spare time at work and things are slow, so you should look to add it to your library when you get the chance.			",2088,759,56,251,223,20,316

												I'm a big fan of dungeon crawlers, and this one has a LOT of options to keep a player occupied. First off, it has to be said: if for nothing else, this game is brilliant because it does not require you to die from starvation, which is nearly ubiquitous in roguelike games. There's plenty of other ways to die, but they all involve poor choices (trying to disarm a trap, deciding to fight that monster, wondering what's on the other side of a door) rather than the fickle chance of not finding randomly generated food items. As such the game feels much more fair. And it's funny, as well as fun!			",218,77,4,31,16,0,22

												A fun modern roguelike with a great sense of humor. Besides being turn-based with traps and randomization this isn't your typical roguelike; archaic design is thrown out the window and gameplay is intuitive and can be mouse or keyboard driven. There is no hunger or limited turns and permanent death is completely optional across the three difficulty settings. There are tons of skill builds to choose from and most of them are fun and useful in some way or another. Graphics are nothing special but it does look good for a roguelike and there is enough variation between floors to keep things fresh. The soundtrack is surprisingly good and this game is worth about twice what it costs, so buy it if you like the genre. Exceptional replay value.			",2958,1175,116,358,419,33,494

However second half of the game was boring. It was the same over and over again. Maybe I was too powerful (promethean magic seems unbalanced to me). I rushed through just to kill final boss. By the way the fight was way too easy. So overall I am little bit disapointed. I rate it avarage. It is possible, that I don't understand this game. It should be something like rouge like, or whatever. So if you know what that mean go for it.			",122,45,0,14,5,1,16

Its one of the better Roguelikes out there, although not as good as ZAngband(the version of ZAngband *before* they started trying to make a random overworld and screwed everything up, then AFAIK stopped working on the project.), although the point and click interface is much nicer than trying to remember stuff like Q is your quest list but q quaffs(Quaff?

												Though a pretty cool game I did NOT have a great personal experience with it.A LOT of skills, crafting options, and equipment within the dungeon to choose from.All skills are chosen from the very beginning and are upgradeable as you level up in the game. They range from highly practical to just downright ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles (though still useful).A lot of the fancy crafting has to be done with specific crafting skills that you have to choose when you start the game. They can range from armor, weapons, crossbow bolts, more crafting materials, potions, etc. Every type of item category in the game has a lot of items under them. The fancier stuff either have to be crafted or, if you're lucky, just found randomly as you explore.Loot can be far too plentiful and since I usually like to hoarde loot I was easily overwhelmed by how much I had to let go and sell off to make room. If you're a bit lucky you can get a storage-like item in the form of a big room where you can put a load of crap in and access it whenever & wherever you want.The whole game can be rather difficult if you just rush through it so you're sort of forced to keep killing enemies and exploring to find and/or make better equipment.Along with the cool stuff here I've also got a few personal problems with this game and one of them is how lenghty these dungeons can be. I like to explore every nook and cranny of a dungeon usually and these maps can be huge. There are 10 levels in this dungeon (15 if you have that DLC). Exploring can be delayed by way of a huge mob of enemies coming at me, kicking my♥♥♥♥♥♥ and forcing me to reload to my last save thus having me think of better ways to get through said obstacles.Another problem I have is that I crash every now and again when, I presume, it attemps to auto-save which I can't toggle on or off. Luckily there's a manual save but there's no real way to load a file while you're in the dungeon. If you want to quit the game you're either forced to save & quit, crash, or end the process via task manager. You can only make ONE file per playthrough too meaning you can't choose another slot for another save in one run; you only have your manual save file and your auto-save file.This probably won't happen to everyone but the one thing that ticked me off the most is that after 30+ hours of playing this game I get to the final Level, run into the boss of this whole game (Lord Dredmor) and suddenly have him disappear thus leaving me with no way to finish the game. While fighting him he teleports every now and again just to mess with you and throw magic at you but for MY case he teleports and just vanishes. I've explored the whole dungeon multiple times to see if he's just messing with me again but he was nowhere to be found thus labeling my over-two-dozen-hour playthrough to be a waste. It was guaranteed a waste because my only saves took place after he bugged out since I thought he was just somewhere in the current level waiting for me.Overall, it's still a great game (and at a cheap price, too) with a lot of exploring & crafting, equipment, and skill options to choose from. Also don't let the not-so-stellar artwork be a downer.  ",562,144,9,67,46,7,69

												A must if you've played any traditional roguelikes, though it's arguably not as difficult (still comes with multiple difficulties and a togglable permadeath, at least). With a unique stats system and starting skills that can be combined in creative ways, Dungeons of Dredmor delivers a humorous, addictive, and highly replayable dungeon crawler. There are also plenty of items to discover, including potions and mushrooms that each bear different effects upon the user, as well as an array of weapons and armor with silly damage types and resistances (e.g. a ring that provides existential damage resistance to its user, or a dagger that deals asphyxiating and aethereal damage to its target).Sometimes the best way to get into a roguelike is to dive in without any prior research, and at its price, Dungeons of Dredmor is a steal.

												A lot of us define a good game by one we can sink a ""£1 an hour of good gameplay"", and in that sense, Dungeons of Dredmor is one of the best investments possible - you can get it, with all the DLC, for only £5. I've currently got 51 hours in it, so it's been more than a good investment, in that sense.The gameplay is... Solid. It's turn based, so  you're hardly on the edge of your seat, but the enemies are unique and the taunts are funny. Lots of references. There's even a fantastic mod, ""Death by One Thousand Taunts"", which adds even more. It's great.Because there's a surprising amount of workshop content for a near-six year old game, some mods add new skill trees, etc., so even if you do a playthrough of every skill type, there'll be new ones to try.I never thought I could play rogue-likes. I'm not that great at Binding of Isaac, though that might be because you cannot save and exit it, however with Dredmor, you can save and exit, so you can come back and replay whenever you want.You can run this in a potato. And get more than enough hours into it to make it more than worth the while. 9/10 a fantastic investment.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Or both.Permadeath is the best way to play, but whether you get random skills or not is more of a personal choice depending on how challenging you want it to be and how serious you want to be about trying to get to the end.All in all, this is a very fun game that I have enjoyed spending a lot of time on.

												I got an achievment for the game crashing. 10/10In all seriousness, though, this game is fantastic. It has incredibly fluid gameplay, which is both challenging and addictive. The combat is a little like Skyrim, in that you can get out of it exactly what you want. I'm generally kind of cheap, but there is no question about this game being worth its asking price. My suggestion is that you get the DLCs as well. They're cheap and they add a ton of content to an already fantastic game. Plus, you get the full range of mods from this game's wonderful community.If I had to pick a gripe, however, it would be an aesthetic one. I don't love the way the game looks, though it is serviceable. The main character's eyebrows are almost distractingly large. Aside from that, none of the equipment that you pick up or craft shows up your character. This is a little irritating, as it doesn't necessarily give you the sense of progression that one might want out of a game like this. Regardless, however, this game is fantastic. If you're into dungeon crawlers or rogulelikes, don't even hesitate to pick this one up. It's a real gem.			",294,102,3,118,33,0,51

												A silly, beginner-friendly yet potentially tough roguelike.To me, its greatest strength is the customization - you can pick seven skill paths for each character, which heavily influence gameplay and can result in interesting combinations. Additionally, there's user-created skills and other content, some of which is as clever and balanced as the original game.Compared to NetHack and most similar roguelikes,  there's a lot more focus on clarity, but there's still some things you have to learn through experimentation. There's also a lot more focus on spellcasting and character creation and the (optional) crafting system.Combat is fairly hack-and-slay, which can feel pretty tedious, but there's a ""no time to grind"" option for smaller floors, and synergetic abilities can finish battles a lot faster.The game features three difficulty modes and the option to turn off permadeath, so beginners (and anyone else) can reduce its frustration potential if they want to. On the other hand, the hardest difficulty delivers a great challenge akin to traditional roguelikes.			",147,29,0,20,10,0,11

												I'm a big fan of dungeon crawlers, and this one has a LOT of options to keep a player occupied. First off, it has to be said: if for nothing else, this game is brilliant because it does not require you to die from starvation, which is nearly ubiquitous in roguelike games. There's plenty of other ways to die, but they all involve poor choices (trying to disarm a trap, deciding to fight that monster, wondering what's on the other side of a door) rather than the fickle chance of not finding randomly generated food items. As such the game feels much more fair. And it's funny, as well as fun!			",218,77,4,31,16,0,22

The combat is great, the UI is great, the way you manage skills and stats is great, the HUMOR is absolutely perfect. The game itself is highly moddable and there are tons of them on the workshops.To add some icing on the cake, the developers (Gaslamp Games) are one of the coolest dudes ever, and I suggest you closely monitor their next game (Clockwork Empires, they first turned a rogue-like into a good-looking understandable game, now they're doing the same to dwarf fortress)			",73,16,1,14,6,2,11

												Gaslamp Game’s first production, Dungeons of Dredmor, has accumulated quiet a cult following since its release two years ago, combining the unpredictability of rougelikes with the slick, mobile ready interface younger gamers have come to expect. But the fundamental issue with for-profit rougelikes are two-fold: they are directly challenging some of the greatest games ever made, and two, all of their competition is free. I will put my cards on the table. I am a diehard Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup fan. I play it on my phone when I’m waiting in line. I squeeze a quick game in before bed most nights. The depth, years of production, and meticulous balance are difficult to find outside of the RL genre. And, it’s absolutely, positively, 100% free. So when the competitor’s game starts off costing infinitely more than nothing, it’s already at a disadvantage. This is compounded by DoD’s other glaring flaw which is balance, or lack thereof. It is clear that the game was built, from concept to code to graphics, as a lark. Everything is a joke. All the references make it a blast to play. There are enough jokes that it even adds to replayability. But it also killed any shred of equality the game once had. Instead of picking a class and a race, as is standard with most RPGs, you pick seven skill trees which effect both passive stats and activated abilities, and go on your merry way. But pick the wrong trees, or wrong combination of trees, and you will find progression past a certain point impossible. For example, I would love to use the pole arm class. But the scarcity of the weapon itself, along with the subpar nature of the skill tree, makes it useless when compared to the sword or mace or even unarmed skills. About a fifth of the skill trees involve crafting, which in all cases is satisfactorily powerful, but turns the game from a fast paced dungeon romp into a painfully accurate hoarding simulation. Jokes about polishing your wand are great, I just wish the wand crafting skill was as much fun to use as it was to read about.But in light of all this. In spite of the cost, regardless of the glaring flaws in the mechanics, I have still spent time playing this game, and avidly suggest it to friends who aren’t ready for a full on ASCII rougelike experience. It’s a fantastic gateway to a genre otherwise regarded as impenetrable. My issues arise from playing games like it for years, but for someone who doesn’t enjoy their eyes bleeding, a few extra dollars and inept skill trees will not sullen the experience. The controls are straight forward and predictable. And the experience is still that of a rouge like. All the frustration and theory crafting in a nice, accessible package. You will love this game. You will hate this game. But most importantly, you will play this game. You won’t spend all your time in menus figuring out how to quaff a potion, or figuring out what a certain object is. You will spend your time dying, and that’s what rougelikes are all about.So if you’re looking for a new experience, and have no idea what a NetHack is or think Dwarf Fortress is a chapter out of Lord of the Rings, there is no better place to start than with Dungeons of Dredmor. If, like me, you have past experience with the genre, you may find the depth a bit lacking. But overall, I applaud the developers efforts to make a deserving medium accessible.

												If you're a fan of dungeon-crawling RPGs or tabletop games like D&D, then it's hard to imagine you wouldn't like Dungeons of Dredmor.It's witty, nerdy, challenging, and deep.It can be a little glitchy sometimes (but not in a game-breaking way) and the visuals and sounds harken back to older games, but I've never encountered anything that's turned me off from this game.I think of it like a turn-based Diablo 2 if Blizzard's writing had a great sense of humor instead of a soul-crushing sense of tragic despair.

												Though a pretty cool game I did NOT have a great personal experience with it.A LOT of skills, crafting options, and equipment within the dungeon to choose from.All skills are chosen from the very beginning and are upgradeable as you level up in the game. They range from highly practical to just downright ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles (though still useful).A lot of the fancy crafting has to be done with specific crafting skills that you have to choose when you start the game. They can range from armor, weapons, crossbow bolts, more crafting materials, potions, etc. Every type of item category in the game has a lot of items under them. The fancier stuff either have to be crafted or, if you're lucky, just found randomly as you explore.Loot can be far too plentiful and since I usually like to hoarde loot I was easily overwhelmed by how much I had to let go and sell off to make room. If you're a bit lucky you can get a storage-like item in the form of a big room where you can put a load of crap in and access it whenever & wherever you want.The whole game can be rather difficult if you just rush through it so you're sort of forced to keep killing enemies and exploring to find and/or make better equipment.Along with the cool stuff here I've also got a few personal problems with this game and one of them is how lenghty these dungeons can be. I like to explore every nook and cranny of a dungeon usually and these maps can be huge. There are 10 levels in this dungeon (15 if you have that DLC). Exploring can be delayed by way of a huge mob of enemies coming at me, kicking my♥♥♥♥♥♥ and forcing me to reload to my last save thus having me think of better ways to get through said obstacles.Another problem I have is that I crash every now and again when, I presume, it attemps to auto-save which I can't toggle on or off. Luckily there's a manual save but there's no real way to load a file while you're in the dungeon. If you want to quit the game you're either forced to save & quit, crash, or end the process via task manager. You can only make ONE file per playthrough too meaning you can't choose another slot for another save in one run; you only have your manual save file and your auto-save file.This probably won't happen to everyone but the one thing that ticked me off the most is that after 30+ hours of playing this game I get to the final Level, run into the boss of this whole game (Lord Dredmor) and suddenly have him disappear thus leaving me with no way to finish the game. While fighting him he teleports every now and again just to mess with you and throw magic at you but for MY case he teleports and just vanishes. I've explored the whole dungeon multiple times to see if he's just messing with me again but he was nowhere to be found thus labeling my over-two-dozen-hour playthrough to be a waste. It was guaranteed a waste because my only saves took place after he bugged out since I thought he was just somewhere in the current level waiting for me.Overall, it's still a great game (and at a cheap price, too) with a lot of exploring & crafting, equipment, and skill options to choose from. Also don't let the not-so-stellar artwork be a downer.  ",562,144,9,67,46,7,69

												A must if you've played any traditional roguelikes, though it's arguably not as difficult (still comes with multiple difficulties and a togglable permadeath, at least). With a unique stats system and starting skills that can be combined in creative ways, Dungeons of Dredmor delivers a humorous, addictive, and highly replayable dungeon crawler. There are also plenty of items to discover, including potions and mushrooms that each bear different effects upon the user, as well as an array of weapons and armor with silly damage types and resistances (e.g. a ring that provides existential damage resistance to its user, or a dagger that deals asphyxiating and aethereal damage to its target).Sometimes the best way to get into a roguelike is to dive in without any prior research, and at its price, Dungeons of Dredmor is a steal.

												A fun modern roguelike with a great sense of humor. Besides being turn-based with traps and randomization this isn't your typical roguelike; archaic design is thrown out the window and gameplay is intuitive and can be mouse or keyboard driven. There is no hunger or limited turns and permanent death is completely optional across the three difficulty settings. There are tons of skill builds to choose from and most of them are fun and useful in some way or another. Graphics are nothing special but it does look good for a roguelike and there is enough variation between floors to keep things fresh. The soundtrack is surprisingly good and this game is worth about twice what it costs, so buy it if you like the genre. Exceptional replay value.			",2958,1175,116,358,419,33,494

Posted: January 25, 2014
												Robust yet simple, deep yet entirely lighthearted, Dungeons of Dredmor is a shining example of a roguelike done in exactly the right way-- Hilariously.This is how it's meant to be. You build a unique character from skill pools ranging from simple swordsmanship and spellcraft to things like math, legal, and veganism-based combat, and proceed through a randomized, turn-based dungeon in the traditional roguelike style- which is to say, slowly, with an emphasis on choosing what you'll do next and contending with the consequences. Commands are never overwhelmingly complicated, with the game dishing out new active skills conservatively, and yet there never seems to be a shortage of ways to handle any given situation. As frequently as death comes (it's the nearest thing to an inevitability), there's always the sense that maybe, just maybe it would have been better to hurl something at that last monster and run away than to have tried to sneak up on it. While there's inevitably some frustration in trekking through a dungeon for a full hour before being reduced to a bloody, lifeless high score, Dredmor eases the pain with variable difficulties and and the option of turning off the permadeath, so impatient adventurers might throw themselves into something brutish and horrible just to get the full experience before rounding out their experience with a swift death, while more anxious players might tone down the experience to something more casual and preserve their precious adventurer until the game's proper end. The sheer extent to which your uniquely-tailored character can actually be developed keeps the latter approach from getting stale too quickly, while the extent to which your handpicked skill trees actually matter from the beginning keeps the quick and dirty approach fresh from restart to restart.In the end, if there's a single thing working against Dredmor's lovingly-crafted delves, it's the entire genre's problem: Every move is its own intimate life-or-death decision, with all the time in the world to choose between as many actions as your character is capable of, and as such it can only have ever been a single-player experience. As tempting as it is to tell your friends about that incredible time you narrowly escaped a desperate one-sided fight by electing to abandon your sword and instead physically throw the monster into a brutal trap, it's an experience you'll have invariably shared with yourself alone. It simply can't be helped- Dungeons of Dredmor is a very single-player game, and yet it still does its best to keep you company. Each learned skill rarely comes without a joke to accompany it, monsters sling petty insults your way, and even in your most dramatic victories, the game's narration will do everything in its power to take the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you- but what more can you expect when you're a law-school educated burglar, communist viking, or Regent of Throwing Stuff At People? Dredmor's a lonely experience, but makes every effort not to feel like one.Overall, if you've ever been a fan of roguelikes, Dungeons of Dredmor is a refreshingly unique presentation of everything you're already certain you like, and if you've never touched one before, Dredmor is still a perfectly complete example of everything the genre ought to be, with success dependent on what you do, rather than how fast you can do it. As hard as you make it, as deep as you feel like going, and dripping with wit and charm (and other fluids), this game isn't content to simply kill you repeatedly. It wants to be your friend while it does so.My advice? Let it. Unless you've specifically got a problem with turn-based or single-player gaming, Dungeons of Dredmor is a humble yet delightful dungeon-crawl worth far more than its modest price tag in delicious suspense, strategy, humor, and gratuitous fantasy violence.

												Very specific  RPG. I finished it and therefore I think, I like it. First 5-6 dungeon levels (about half of the game) was challenging. I constantly found new stuff (item, spells, etc.). However second half of the game was boring. It was the same over and over again. Maybe I was too powerful (promethean magic seems unbalanced to me). I rushed through just to kill final boss. By the way the fight was way too easy. So overall I am little bit disapointed. I rate it avarage. It is possible, that I don't understand this game.

												Bought this during the Steam Summer Sale and this title alone was worth the bucks I spent in total - it's hilarious, it's full of wonderful references and at its core an awesome rogue-like crawler. For those in the know: It's like Munchkin-turned-videogame. Bashing through the next door, bleeding (from an agressive carrot) you kick in the door, sacrifice lutefisk to the lutefisk god, hoping for something good to whack those creatures only to find yourself at the receiving end of a nasty trap. You're dead. Did I mention it has Emo as a school of magic? And that you can become Totally Not Drizzt? Yeah. Now go, spend these few bucks and have a blast, best turn on some cheesy fantasy music (DND Soundtracks anyone? *chuckle*).. and whack them all!			",29,15,0,17,7,0,4

												DoD is a really fun ""roguelike"" RPG. While the story has no depth, and the presentation of the graphics and sound are extremely basic, the character creation system is varied, and the turn based combat is very tactical. Each character selects 7 skills from a pool of 30+, which cover melee and ranged combat, offensive magic, summons, buffs, crafting, thieving, and more. Each skill can be improved at level up to unlock new spells or abilities. The strategy of combat revolves around knowing where to position yourself, and choosing the right time to use an ability, item or spell. The many different combinations of skills provides lots of varied playing styles. Replayability is further extended by each of the 10+ dungeon floors having a random layout for every new game. The ultimate challenge is to play through in permadeath mode, where your character and any saves are deleted upon death. The low purchase price is ridiculously good value for money.

You get to create a character with 7 skills (sound familiar ultima online fans?) then proceed down a dungeon at your own pace.  There's no town or anything, just vending machines.  It's a lot like the old pc game Mordor.  If you have a sense of humor and like oldschool dungeon crawlers, check this one out.			",132,64,7,64,43,0,51

												I found Dungeons of Dredmor somewhat compelling, but every time I would play, I would get sucked in for several hours as I traipsed through level after level systematically destroying everything, only to get wiped out by one stupid play. I eventually decided I was wasting too much time with it and not enjoying it any more, so I uninstalled it. I found it frustrating that I couldn't min-max *everything* because some crafting recipes are pretty much always not available to you. I liked the skill system and that you can choose several rather than just rolling up one of seven different classes or whatever, and some of the descriptions were entertaining, but ultimately my problem with roguelikes is that they often end up as the video game equivalent of road hypnosis -- you spend hours and hours playing them and then you slip up once and you're toast. Or maybe I'm just playing them wrong?			",279,123,1,42,26,2,53

												Want to initiate yourself in Roguelikes, but, for some reason, can't stand some of their gimmicks? Maybe it is the permadeath? Maybe it is the fact that most of them rely on the Random Number God having mercy on you (Hahahaha! Mercy, what a funny joke!)? Maybe it is the fact that the ASCII graphics do not help you get immersed? Give this a try, then. It has three difficulty levels to lessen RNG impact, the option to turn permadeath off so you are not pressed by the need to constantly play it safe, and the graphics are just awesome!

												Dungeons of Dredmor is one of my favorite games.  It is just so much fun to play, so many small little thing have been refined to just make it a really fun and good game. It has a lot of skills you can choose from, the crafting is pretty large and it really gives you a lot of options on how to play it. If you think the game is a bit of a grind you can turn on ""no time to grind."" It speeds up the game quite a bit.  If you think it is too hard you can try easy. If you think the game isn't forgiving enough you can turn off permadeath. The humor is great, and the interface is really well done, making the game feel very fun to play. nowadays I usually play on no time to grind, 15 floors normal difficulty with random skills, there are still skills I haven't played a full game with, plus there is a lot of community stuff as well so it almost feels like it is endless fun. Though if you are one of those people looking for a cheap thrill through graphics, or If you must have completely laid out for you, this game might not be your cup of tea.  You have to put a fair amount of effort into it to beat it on permadeath.			",141,68,24,24,21,2,26

												What can I say about Dungeons of Dredmor? Well, first of all, let me say that this is the first time I've played a roguelike and enjoyed it. Immensely. This is perhaps the most accessible, most enjoyable roguelike game out there, with a great artstyle, a metric butt-ton of nerdy jokes and references to things like Doctor Who, Discworld, etc, and some of the most hilarious achievement sets I've seen thus far on Steam (there is literally an achievement for kicking a door until you die from a broken foot). This game has almost infinite replayability, with dozens of skills in nearly endless combinations and enough mods out there to keep the game going long after you've played the whole shebang, Dredmor is a delightful, near-endless experience I'd recommend to anyone with a bit of extra cash on their hands.

												Dungeons of Dredmor is a fantastic dungeon crawler with a great sense of humor, amazing depth and great replayability. I'll keep this review short and sweet: If you want a game that will keep you coming back for it's gameplay, humor, style and depth then Dungeons of Dredmor is for you.			",192,10,0,17,4,2,13

												Dungeons of Dreamor is a dungeon crawling RPG with an interesting take on the turn based approach. By that, I mean that your actions count as turns. You don't go into a battle mode, the entire game works on turns. If you take a step, pick up an item, use an item, use a spell, use an attack, defend... all of these things count as a turn. So whenever you do something, every enemy gets to as well. This is also used in coodowns on abilities and regeneration of health and magic. Insead of waiting on a timer, you do actions to keep the game moving. It's great for pacing. Before you even start playing, you have some options you can set, and then you get to pick from a number of different abilities. So you're not restricted to a class, as in some other games like this. Instead, you just pick whatever abilities you want, which is fun for customization and replayability. As you level up, you can chose to level up those abilities as you see fit, but only one per level. The gameplay, aside from the turn system, is pretty standard. You walk around a huge dungeon, fighting enemies and looting the place. You can also craft a great number of things along the way, provided you have the materials, the tool used to craft it, and enough points in the required skill to make the item. This is where I start to have some issues.See, you can pick your own skills. You can also level your own skills as you please. But sometimes you'll pick skills that don't cover the areas you need in order to make certain items. If you don't have that to level up, you simply cannot make those types of items. That can be annoying. It can also be annoying to have all the materials, the skills, and not the tool required to make the item. Although that can be remedied by finding one somewhere in the dungeon. My biggest complaint is that the inventory you have is a tad small. It makes you have to manage your items well, constantly craft items to use up materials (but that's not always so easy to do), or constantly backtrack to the shops to sell things. I guess you could leave stuff laying around but then it'd go to waste. Having a few more slots would help a lot. I guess it comes with the territory of looting. And with the skill complain, I suppose you just have to plan ahead and know what you can and can't do, which in turn will help you identify which items you do and do not need. Some of the skills in the begining don't explain what they do, choosing to have a joke description instead. This can be annoying to deal with and try to remember what they actually do later. Some of the drinkable and edible items you get aren't specific about what they do either. You might drink something or eat something that puts a debuff on you, hurts you, or even kills you! And the game is littered with traps. Some you can see, some you can't. Sometimes you can go around them, sometimes you need to walk over them to get to another spot. Sometimes you can disable them, sometimes that'll fail and they'll go off anyways. Imagine hitting a random trap that you couldn't even see, only to have THAT be the end of all your hard work. With permadeath on (as the default), it's quite maddening. Still, this game is massive and... very difficult. I've sunk almost 20 hours into it as of right now and and never made it past the second floor. Am I bad? Maybe. But it's pretty easy to die from random stuff. I may have misread this but I think there's something like ten floors normally and fifteen with the expansions. So there's tons of stuff to do in this game. There's even tons of things I haven't even figured out yet! It's an amazing amount of content and playtime for what only costs you 5 bucks. Heck, toss in the extra buck for the DLC and get even more out of it like I did. It's very well worth the price tag and I'm really surprised it isn't going for more than that. It could definitely be a 10 or even 15 dollar game. Dungeons of Dreadmor gets an 8/10 for being an immense dungeon crawler with an interesting take at a great price.			",222,48,1,22,12,3,19

												I sat down to play Dredmor one night, and then I realised 248 hours had passed and the sun had come up 10 times... or was it 11?Dredmor is a turn-based procedurally generated dungeon crawler (with the option for permadeath) in which you clear out a dungeon level by level until you hit the bottom and kill the final boss - a pretty simple premise and no back-story to speak of; but that's okay, this game is all about the gameplay, and the loot (oh so much loot).The crafting system is pretty well designed and there's a lot of cool stuff to make (such as chainswords!!) but it's also kind of a pain because it's hard to know what scrap metals and garbage to keep in your limited inventory as you won't have access to all the blueprints at the start of each play-through, and you rely on randomly finding the right ones.Dredmor has all the standard RPG skill trees like swordplay and archery, but it also includes some pretty weird skill trees such as mathemagician, tourist, and communist. The best thing is that, regardless of what seven skills you pick for your character, you are not locked into using certain types of equipment. If you find it, you can use it regardless of class or level. This means you can just play the character any way you want to, which is a lot more fun than being locked into the standard warrior, mage, or thief classes like in many other RPGs.Dredmor includes lots of references to other games and popular culture, and it kind of reminds me of older games that didn't have to be so serious. This really gives the game the extra shot of charm it needs to help you look past it's flaws (and there's a lot of flaws in Dredmor, I just choose to ignore them because it's so much fun).9 out of 10, would grind (and there's a lot of grinding to be done, but it's a good kind of grind).

Be an egyption vampire sword smashing alchemist, or maybe being an emo reporter who enjoys traveling to show of your fire magic. Be whatever you want to be, and experience a new way to play every time. For more fun, try to utilze the random abilities feature, ensuring that every time you play with be completely new. Want to compete with a friend? Choose the same abilities and see who can survive the longest in the dungeon. A never ending source of fun and merriment for all who play it.			",190,35,2,36,26,2,32

												Dungeons of Dredmor is a pretty fun look at the old roguelike genre, and was a great romp down memory lane. While the graphics are simple, as is the gameplay, a simple interface masks a surprisingly deep customization and talent system. The synergy between different skills will have you experimenting with builds for DAYS. The addition and seamless integration of Steam Workshop was nothing short of brilliant, and when you feel like you've seen everything in Dungeons of Dredmor, provides HOURS of extra enjoyment.Good: Solid gameplay, fun visual aesthetic, good music. Deep and complex customization presented in a brilliantly accesible way.Bad: Some skills are just too good. Whenever there's a skill that me and ALL my friends separately came to the conclusion that it MUST be in your build, things need a little tinkering. Ugly: Not much.Possibly the worst thing I can say about DoD is that the era of the traditional rogue formula is definitely showing its age. The procedure of ""I move, then all enemies move, then I move"" is showing its age as a design process. Dungeons of Dredmor could be that last, best look at a wonderful genre, and I enjoyed the hell out of it, but I think it will be the last true rogue I play. It's time to see what the words ""rogue like"" can do attached to other formats of gameplay.			",205,51,1,60,35,1,18

												If you like fantasy pop-culture references, irreverent humor, and hoarding items ""just in case"", then this is the game for you. Didn't think I was going to enjoy this game as much as I do, but it's challenging and addicting. At a certain point, it feels a bit grindy, but there's the option to streamline dungeon size such that your spending less time on each floor but still progressing through the game. Plenty of replay value if you like exploring different play styles and challenging yourself!And there's seriously nothing like strutting around feeling like you own the place and then feeling your stomach drop when you open a door to a monster zoo.Buy this game, it's totally worth the price, and you'll have a blast adventuring!

												A fun  and funny turn based dungeon crawler. The only ""downside"" I can think of is that it is very hard to actually beat the game and that it can be time consuming. However, both of those are also part of the game's charm. The game is not meant to be beaten on your first try, it is meant for you to make a character, see how far you can get with it and then try again with a different one, or the same one, your choice. All in all I think it is definitely worth your time, I've had it a long time and still have a lot of fun with it			",50,9,0,8,1,0,3

												One of the most fun and addictive games I have ever found. Endless dungeon-crawling goodness with an enormous array of skills, tools, and combinations, a great sense of fun, and the ability to progress at your own speed. You can always roll up a new character and find something you hadn't seen before, or learn a new trick. The game is a series of dungeons descending to an ultimate evil, with pocket dimensions, shops, and altars to various gods along the way. You create a character with a wide selection of skills in different trees (Archeology, Paranormal Investigation, Barbarian, to name only a few) which you can then level up as you progress. Along the way you fight strange and often hilarious monsters and collect materials to craft or sell. Strange combinations of these produce interesting results, mixing in teleportation, tunneling, invisibility, mind control, and many more!The game is charming, the art is lovely, the creators are helpful and responsive, and the music is pleasant. Try it.			",148,69,2,12,10,1,10

												I have a soft spot for roguelites, even though I'm (generally speaking) absolutely SHÏTE at them. But they're usually a whole lotta fun. Charging into a horde of enemies, battle-axe in hand, loincloth flapping in the wind, and then getting stomped into monster sandwich spread because what kind of a fûckin' retärd doesn't wear PROPER armour when they're out savaging monsters?!But I digress. Dungeons of Dredmor then. I like it. I won't go so far as to say that I love it, but I will just spoil this review right now and tell you: YES, I WILL RECOMMEND THIS FÛCKING SHÏT, BECAUSE IT'S A REALLY GOOD GAME.I feel like I basically cut myself short just now, seeing as how I don't have all THAT much to talk 'bout when it comes to ol' DoD. I mean, the humour in it is nicely silly, without being overly dumb. And I do like that it's not pitching a tent in either the Bulletstorm cesspit or the Duke Nukem Forever leper colony, but the much less unappealing Monty Python-esque silly nonsense, uhh... fish factory. I dunno. I was struggling to come up with something, so I just wrote the first thing that came to mind.Anyway! Moving on. I like that pretty much every single skill in the game is at least somewhat unique, and that they all have some measure of usefulness, even though some are pretty damn overpowered (lookin' at you, Perception (yes, that was a pun, get over it)) while some are... well... less useful (*coughs* veganism *coughs*). But anyway. The ability to mix 'n' match skills 'til your boxers squeal (because the expression ""till your hearts contents"" makes no göddämn fûcking sense!), so you'll have plenty of replay value.The gameplay itself is nicely straight-forward. You typically walk around with WASD, you see an enemy, approach them, and then either bump up against 'em or click on 'em to attack. Not exactly rocket surgery, ehh? But the fact that the game is, how should I say... ""step-based"", I guess? Well, whatever you'd call it, it's the only hybridization of real-time and turn-based I've ever seen that actually works really well.Those of you who've played Fatal Labyrinth on the SEGA Genesis know what I mean. To clarify, enemies can only move, attack, and do other stuff at the same time as you do, but you don't take traditional turns attacking each other. So when you attack an enemy, they'll attack you back. This makes it so that you'll ALWAYS have time to think about what to do next, but the pacing of the game doesn't necessarily suffer for it, unlike in games like Heroes of Might & Magic or XCOM.The graphics are fairly simple and low-key, just to change the topic com-fûcking-pletely, but they have a nicely stylistic charm to them. Most pixel games generally just go for the 8-bit style out of sheer laziness, but DoD seems to take the same road as Stardew Valley or Shovel Knight, and instead have a pixelated style with plenty of details and actually nice colour palettes. Which I obviously like.And now I'm reaching dangerously close to the final point regarding DoD: if it's such a solid game, why do I not like it more? Well, I will warn you right now that it's insanely fûcking grindtastic, and unless you play with the Smaller Floors option on, you'll be doing a fûcking retärded amount-a walking around in the game. There's also the fact that even though almost all skills are in some way useful, there are builds that WILL inevitably break the game, even on the hardest difficulty, and basically turn you into an all-powerful mega-god.But I have to admit, DoD does a lotta things really, really, REALLY well, and since my only complaints with it are minor nuisances at most, I really can't give it that low of a grading. It's also worth noting that Dungeons of Dredmor (unlike nearly every single roguelite out there) does actually let you play on a fairly softcore difficulty level, and while I personally wish there were more options to customize the ""hardness"" of the game, this does make it so that even less skilled players can play it. So that's definitely a big plus.All in all, DoD has a lotta solid points, and while it's a bit rough around the edges, it's still got a lot of charm to it, and it's definitely worth buying, even if you're normally not a huge fan of roguelite games. 8.9/10			",256,39,2,25,30,0,45

												Dungeons of Dredmor is a great singleplayer rpg, basic old school dungeon crawler with killing monster, leveling up, getting epic loot and crafting, and quests, this game alone will keep you entertained for many hous to come, Even has 121 achievments to keep you going. Then there are addons from the steam workshop you can check out for enhanced gamplay.The sound track is some of the best in a while, and the gameplay is fast and slow in parts, and the AI really gives you a fight if you are not ready for it so watch out. There are a few diffrent gameplay modes for challenge basicly a easy, medum, and hard, with permadeath, or smaller floors with same exp gain. If you have not tried this game yet, this is a must to have for any rpg fan.			",666,213,23,131,86,18,96

												Having played a couple of days and reaching Lord Dredmor, i must conclude that the game:- has a fun set of monsters- invites you to try out new skill combinations, thus has replay value- has a _great_ music- includes lutefiskbut looking back, there are some negative points too:- bugs roughly every 10 minutes (at least on the linux version), ranging from misplaced items (cant reach) or monsters (4 stacked upon), crashes every 30 minutes (after some in-game time / progress)- the crafting system is dysfunctional (getting a lvl1 recipie in the last lvl of the dungeon - too random, too many ""silly""/useless crafts, 3 ingots for a simple item without stats - ingots too rare)- fun for 99.9% of the game, then Lord Dredmor kills you with 2 strikes- nonexistent help/tips: ""what does potion/mushroom xxx do?"" is part of most roguelites, but a simple tooltip how to use knightly leap or what some stat-gain gets you would be very pleasant.- lutefisk cube: The idea is that you can transform every non-food item to lutefisk and then donate it to the fish-god who gives you a random item. But to have a good chance you need about 200 pieces. But trading a 13k gold item for 1 piece of lutefisk?? Would just need some price/lutefisk scaling. This game is in such a nice and interesting state, but lets call it beta quality and finish up those loose ends.			",81,18,0,18,15,0,23

												I started my first dungeon as a communistic, vegan Emo-Pirate who was heavily into Mathemagic, tipping my fedora to the ladies, punching my way barehanded through the dungeon. In the second room I stumbled upon a device which let me enter a pocket dimension, where I punched a machine to open up the gates to hell. Naturally I entered and tipped my fedora again. I was then embraced and slaughtered by giant demons and died. 10/10 would tip my fedora again to die.			",388,125,8,29,40,5,38

												So... I am writing this review, because the game pushed me towards the edge of negative emotions. Which is quite sad, because the game itself and idea are really good and addictive, sadly not enough to forgive all the non-stop, gamebreaking issues.The mains reasons why I cannot, by any stretch of imagination recommend this game.1. Game crashes. Crashes sometimes are game-breaking, as the game sometimes just does not save at all. A crash couple times after 1-2 hours of playtime led to completely losing the whole progress until that point and resetting everything including game settings, which is impossible to accept,2. Game does not autosave for no apparent reason. It shows during gameplay that game has been saved, yet when starting the game the day after I'm still starting not from what I have left, but from the very previous save, which feels like even bigger waste of time - there is no way I am going to go through same thing I have passed already and got the good stuff and upgraded my character. It's just not fun at all and misses the purpose, because it's far from similar to replaying the game after death. It makes me not want to play it anymore because I don't know when save will work from the proper place and when it won't.3. Numerous glitches, including popping through doors, attacks that were impossible to hit they still do, I believe it's some sort of trying to give an advantage to silly AI which sucks terribly.4. Game performance is just plain awful. It has not been optimized for anything, and as far as the retro visual estetics go, clunkiness and non responsivness to keyboard is one more thing that CAN NOT BE ACCEPTED in game that has been out there for so long.I swear, don't buy it. It's more frustrating than anything you've met and after reading revious others left you can see these are not an uncommon problems. It will make you love the game, and few momens later you will hate it dearly and want your money back so you can get go get a burger instead of buggy, unplayble game. Shame on you, lazy♥♥♥♥♥developer.			",202,29,15,33,14,2,19

												A very fun little rouge-like game where you have a lot of synergy with many off the abilities, some of which are just made for humor like vampire and the ability to sparkle or communism and a ability to drop a bomb. It's one hell of a time waster, but at the same time you can actually cut down the size of the dungeon with NO reprecussions. None. No achievements are affected either. Really, it's a lot of fun, especially as you can wear some light armour with magic which paths the way to making something like a Magus from Pathfinder's Ultimate Magic or Arcane duelist from D&D 3.5 or, again, Pathfinder.

												This game has been netted as one of my personal favorite roguelikes. A big fan of Gaslamp and their crew - I'm stoked to have been part of a lot of beta testing for the content of this game and even to where an achievement that I suggested on the forums has been added in! :DNow. This game sets up the limits of...weird. And the DLC has only improved it. The crafting system is large and well varied, the Wizard Keys and finding graffitti scrawled on the walls with codes to new levels, all the loot you can shake a stick at, in-game vending machines selling you everything from baseballs to ground meat and nukes and Root Of T'char. The greatest thing about this game is how varied the outcomes can be. You have the choices of 6 different talent trees out of 15+ ones and none are ""right"" OR ""wrong."" The game gives you the freedom to play as you please and the Save-Exit function is a godsend when you start delving and you feel tired. Levelling up and playing is turn based and the enemies move as you move.Overall: I have so much fun with this game that I've yet to finish ONE game. 70+ hours on and offline with this game and every time there's that itch to re-roll a character and try a new combination JUST BECAUSE the skill trees augment and vary your gameplay so much!GOOD:-Fair play RPG.-Lots of contents, weapons, combinations, skill trees, items.-So MANY bad/good puns and references to other bits of culture.-Game never really feels 'unfair' or 'hard' as some other roguelikes. There's mostly always a way to live...mostly. Or run away.-Diggles.-Heroic Vandalism!-Do you like eggs? WELL WE GOT A LOT OF 'EM!-SO MANY community mods and addons for this game made by dedicated players. Hate the current skill trees/items? Well replace them!-The monsters yell and insult you whilst you bash their heads in!-Wands, nukes, steampunk, veganism, were-diggle skills, get Wizard-krunked, Astronomy, blacksmithing...gosh!BAD:-The game does have a tendency to be unbalanced at times when it is you happen to delve too quickly and the enemy levels outpace yours and you find yourself getting smacked upside the head.-The same way you can combine types of damages on weapons and armor...remember that the enemy can do it too. Don't be shocked when you get slapped to all hell when you get hit by 4-8 different types at once and get instagibbed with Boss monsters.-The game is rather lengthy and for some players it's a lot to sit through in one sitting. Breaks are nearly mandatory sometimes. Set your number of levels and difficulty in advance.-Do not turn on permaDETH if you're not a fan of dying. Flushing away a couple hours/days work because you got teleported over a body of water and can't swim is enough to make you cry.-Butcher Rooms. Nuff said.-The stability of the game is still questionable at times and prone to some far-spaced but non-lethal bugs. It's a lot to deal with but the game is still stable.PLEASE NOTE that this game is NO LONGER BEING WORKED ON. This is a CLOSED project. Gaslamp has given up nearly all the resources to create the game back to the community to continue making content and debugging and in general have been very, very good to their players. From allowing us to name the expansions, to adding our own achievements, to allowing bug reports in beta they have done so much for this game and honestly...it's a project made with a lot of love.I may be selling you this game wistfully but I guarantee anyone who buys and plays this wonderful project WILL enjoy themselves immensely. I do recommend this game.			",173,38,2,40,25,0,39

												An excellent game, providing replay value as well as challenge. If you like rogue-like games, this is a good one to invest in. The character choices are many, allowing for any number of gameplay styles and also allowing for an even greater amount of variety, which is fantastic. The skill tree system is straight-forward and nicely balanced, which is lovely as well. It's comedic in many parts, from the absolutely absurd names it randomly generates, to the moderately silly introduction, to the many, many references to a whole bunch of different things - like Morrowind and Bioshock, to name a few. If I had to complain about anything, I'd say that I'd like to see more permanent unlockables, kind of like in The Binding of Isaac, where you can unlock items to find in later runs by achieving certain landmarks.Even at that, however, the game is more than satisfying.

												Dungeons of Dredmore is a great rogue-like RPG, playing both as an homage and parody to the hack 'n' slash and roleplaying games of old.  What makes this game stand out most is the artistic style and the humor of the game itself, being sure to take itself just seriously enough to remain a very solid game.  Also worth mention is the music within the game, composed by Matthew Steele.  If you are a lover of the rogue-like genre, this game is a great deal at less than $5 (U.S.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It’s a really entertaining rogue-like with a lot of fourth wall breaking humour. The flavour text pokes fun at itself while the game options offer various degrees of difficulty and decent gameplay. Per usual, turn-based style when the enemies act when you act. The UI can be a bit confusing, mainly when it comes to icons on the character sheet – by the end of the game items can have almost a dozen of effects and the icons are small and look similar. Also choosing the “paths” at the beginning is obfuscated by the fact that you’ll see the progression they offer only in game, not at the character creation page. Other than that, a lot fun to play. Score 80%.			",200,72,0,31,25,5,50

												All you need to win is dual wield. Thats it. Its so horribly overpowered you dont even need to pick a weapon class.I've played this game for so long Ive actually had to get mods to balance the game for myself. Lockpicks are such a f*cking issue Ive died to doors several times, only for the game to rub it in my face. In the OG version you cannot craft lockpicks, which is stupid b*llsh*t. You can learn to build Imperial Boilerplates and Clockwork Bolt Throwers but you cant fashion a f*cking stick of metal. With the addition of the pocket dimension I thought they were finally paying attention to the terrible crafting system. But they looked over this one glaring issue and I had to cave in.I made my game unholy...But then it was 500% more fun! You can seriously add alotta sh*t to your game to make it much more fun. Thousands more rooms, items, classes, enemies, ect.And if you're not cheap, the addons are good.with 445+ hours on my account, take my word for it. Pretty good, but very fun with mods.

												Warning, if you've never played this game, minor spoilers ahead. (Like, really minor, but spoilers nonetheless.)This game is a unique combination of simple, easy, difficult, relaxing, laid-back, humorous, and just general old-fashioned fun. Holy crap it's fun. Basically you crawl your way through levels of the dungeon to get to the main bad-guy, accumulating a number of unique and silly items, skills, and badassery. Levelling up always feels good, and gaining a skill almost always has a noticeable affect on your combat.Fair warning, you will die a lot. And if you're like me and love pain, you'll play on perma-death (which is optional). On about my fifth character, I was really getting into the swing of things. I had tons of items. I had a pocket dimension I could go to to dump unwanted detritus that might be useful in the future, and I'd just made it through the second floor (still haven't seen the third; the floors are fairly big and ooze with content and monsters). I was fairly powerful at this point, at least for the floor I was on, and easily laid waste to waves of monsters with the help of my zombies and clouds of poison that I conjured. So, feeling like a badass, I hopped over to my pocket dimension to drop off some loot, when I noticed that from said dimension I could also leap to other dimensions! ""Okay, cool,"" so I did. Plowed through one small dimension, no sweat. So I go to another, run into two monsters, kill myself with my own poison cloud. It was my fault for not paying attention, but alllll the hard work, the several hours I'd put into his skills, levels, items. Gone!At that point I said to myself, ""Okay, this is probably the point where going back to the first dungeon just becomes a tedious grind, and I won't want to play anymore."" Well tonight I felt like trying again, trying some new skills. Frankly, it's no less fun than when I played for the first time. The floors are all randomly generated, so it's never the same run between characters.My current character has kicks that literally explode into fire, tearing through enemies like nothing, and I'm only on the first floor.It's not just the content, it's the little quirks. You can tell the developers had a blast making this game. Everything shines with creativity and humour, and it's just a lovely little game gah I love it.10/10, recommended a thousand times yes. It's cheap, you should buy it with the expansions. Get ready to lose at least a few hours a day.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I wasted 29 hours on this game until the corrupted savegame error hit me. That's when I completely lost interest in it. There's no fix for it. I do not want to work with a game where I constantly have to keep working around and muddle with save games in windows folders and backup copies. This is not the MS-DOS era. Although I did enjoy the first hours, this bug simply kills all enjoyment because it means you will have to start a fresh new game from the start.Simply not recommended.

												Unique and challenging at times, it's a joy to play. The humour and various references are great. There are numerous skills that you can mix and match to become whoever you. An axe weilding communist vampire? An archealogist dual sheild weilding vegan? The choices are endless and the mods from the Workshop can add countless more.I've only beaten the game twice but its still fun to try new combinations and see what works and what doesn't.  I usually come back to this game every few months spend hours playing it.  Its a unique game( at least for me, i had never played  a roguelike before) and i just enjoy the humour. For the price, you can't really go wrong.			",153,39,4,45,23,1,36

												This game has the best and most creative class creation system I've ever seen.You mix and match your skills, all skills being available to any character, and, because no classes, no class restrictions.You can run, for instance, a heavy-armor mace-spec necromancer vampire mage.  Or a berserker who deals elemental damage and huge crits and can craft his own gear.  Or a stealthy archaeologist banker.For that alone, and the new-piece-of-gum delight of running into the dungeons again with a new skill group, this game is worth the $5 it costs to pick it up.2600+ Steam players couldn't be wrong.

												A very fun little rouge-like game where you have a lot of synergy with many off the abilities, some of which are just made for humor like vampire and the ability to sparkle or communism and a ability to drop a bomb. It's one hell of a time waster, but at the same time you can actually cut down the size of the dungeon with NO reprecussions. None. No achievements are affected either. Really, it's a lot of fun, especially as you can wear some light armour with magic which paths the way to making something like a Magus from Pathfinder's Ultimate Magic or Arcane duelist from D&D 3.5 or, again, Pathfinder.

												I've also put in plenty of not steam time on Dredmor.Am a big Roguelike fan, and besides the Diablo series, I usually have usually stuck to Angband and the like. I love the ascii look, but the tilesets and animations really add something to the turn based crawling.Super fun dungeon crawling, tense and hilarious situations, lots of skill trees and spells and attributes to tweak, as well as the workshop for new of all of the above make the game very worth it.

												ARGH THIS GAME IS SO GOODIt's a fun little rogue-like (and a genuine rogue-like this time,) where every runthrough is different and fun in its own way. You can try-hard it or mash the random button when choosing your character's skills at start and still have a pretty good time. The game is simple and streamlined where it needs to be and more complex where it should be. Grab the DLC too, and pick up some small mods that don't interfere with the core experience too much, and you've got yourself a fun experience that you won't regret. I'm willing to say this is the best *real* rogue-like (and not just a game with rogue-like elements; Binding of Isaac for example) on Steam.I highly recommend going in on the highest difficulty setting with hardcore mode on.

												All you need to win is dual wield. Thats it. Its so horribly overpowered you dont even need to pick a weapon class.I've played this game for so long Ive actually had to get mods to balance the game for myself. Lockpicks are such a f*cking issue Ive died to doors several times, only for the game to rub it in my face. In the OG version you cannot craft lockpicks, which is stupid b*llsh*t. You can learn to build Imperial Boilerplates and Clockwork Bolt Throwers but you cant fashion a f*cking stick of metal. With the addition of the pocket dimension I thought they were finally paying attention to the terrible crafting system. But they looked over this one glaring issue and I had to cave in.I made my game unholy...But then it was 500% more fun! You can seriously add alotta sh*t to your game to make it much more fun. Thousands more rooms, items, classes, enemies, ect.And if you're not cheap, the addons are good.with 445+ hours on my account, take my word for it. Pretty good, but very fun with mods.

YouTube™ Video: Steam Review E28 Dungeons of Dredmor 

			Views: 145		

			Want something that's totally self-aware, makes you worship lute fish gods, do inconsequential quest and gives you quanta tons of content to sift through?		

Dungeons of Dredmor: An old schoolish, dungeon crawling, loot grabbing, Diggle killing, grid based, rogue-like indie game from Gaslamp Games. Dungeons of Dredmor is a really simple and challenging game, when starting a new game you are first asked to choose between difficulties, permanent death or not and smaller dungeons with the same number of enemies and, if you have the DLC an additional 15 levels to go through. You will not be hurting for things to see and do in Dungeons of Dredmor also, if anyone has gotten 100% on it you are truly one of a kind. Next you are greeted with picking skills, you can choose up to 7 skills from a list of 50 different skills, all offering unique abilities and play styles, and once you've chosen between such skills as Emomancy, Killer Vegan and Bankster you choose male or female and enter the dungeons! The story behind this game is that the evil lich Dredmor was imprisoned beneath the world for being a meanie but, has slowly eroded away his bonds and you are asked to enter into his prison (or dungeon) and stop him!...again! Its dirt simple but, hey it works well and the dungeons are no joke. The game is grid based and combat is turned based, you can click or use the keyboard to move, upon entering combat you trade shots with your foe, (or take turns), the challenge of Dredmor is in how you build your character and, a little bit of luck with finding powerful items and shrines but, mostly in how you build your character. Although there are many skills to pick from some are better suited for dungeoneering than others, some only work better with other skills and there are some that are must haves, make no mistake there are ideal builds for this game. Items come in to play a little bit, especially food and healing items but, the crafting system in Dredmor is deep, there is a lot to craft and I haven't personally seen it but, what I have seen is almost every item in the game being craft-able. There are also skills associated with crafting, so you can build your character around any of the crafts if you so choose (such as being a clockwork, steam-punk knight) and, crafting things is as simple as having the crafting kit and using it with the correct items and there are a TON of items to craft. The graphics are also nice with this mix of hand painted/ comic look style, the game also runs as smooth as butter and, looks so simple you should be able to run it on just about anything so it's a great game for laptops. My only complaint about the graphics is more of a personal desire, the game shows you all these really neat hand-drawn items that look totally badass however, it never shows on your character; your character always will have the same frilly Guybrush Threepwood outfit regardless of the badass armor and traffic cone you have equipped, that kind of detail would have been greatly appreciated. Music in the game is excellent, with lots of organ, piano and strings, giving a sort of melancholy tune alongside some quirky upbeat tunes. The tracks tend to repeat if you linger on a floor too long so that may be a downside depending on how much you like it and, the music is what you'll listen to the majority of the games (in fact it often overpowers the other sounds of the game) so it’s a good thing it’s an awesome soundtrack.Dungeons of Dredmor is funny and challenging, a great game to play anywhere and caters to a lot of playstyles, it’s a solid experience and gives you a huge amount of content to enjoy for a cheap price of $4.99 USD. For $6.99 USD you can get the complete set which I honestly suggest because it’s a great deal for the amount of added content you get even if you don’t end up seeing all of it. If you want a challenge, or a never ending rogue-like game, enter the Dungeons of Dredmor!TL/DR; Dungeons of Dredmor is a rogue-like dungeon crawler with a HUGE amount of content for $4.99 USD, it’s got humor, charm and challenge, with plenty to do and replay ability to the Nth degree. It’s really cheap for what you get, Gaslamp Games certainly is giving you bang for your buck, honestly, if you don’t own the game, consider getting the full package for $6.99 USD, it’s just a few extra bucks and well worth it, plus the DLC by itself is $5.98 USD on its own so don’t waste your money unnecessarily! Check it out and support these guys so we can get more greatness in the future! -Double Thumbs up from RoyialVideo Reviews: youtube.com/RoyialNetwork ",349,48,4,71,30,3,49

												A game that is both a roguelike and hilarious. There are not many games like this. Packed with nerdy references galor and infinite replayability, it's hard to not adore this game. Tons of skills to choose from (even more if you get the $3 expansion), including skills such as Necronomiconomics, Psionics, Mathemagic, Golemancy, and Fungal Arts. There are tons of skills to choose from to make your ideal ""hero"". There are also a variety of difficulties/modes to play on, and since every floor of the dungeon is randomly generated, you'll always be surprised. This is one of the funnest indie games I have ever played, and I think it deserves more attention.The expansion, Realm of the Diggle Gods, introduced the skills Big Game Hunter, Emomancy, Werediggle, Killer Vegan, Piracy, and Demonologist, along with100 new items, 5 new dungeon levels, and many other little things. It also doubles the amount of genders you can choose for your character.			",1323,459,35,180,136,12,186

												Dungeons of Dredmor is an RPG set in a fantasy world. Play as a noble hero who must stop the demonic Lord Dredmora. The once very powerful, was finally defeated, stripped of his power, and then thrown into the underworld. Centuries later, after regenerating his powers, Lord Dredmor decides once again to destroy the human world. Before the start of the game create your avatar. Producer gave up from the traditional choice of character classes. Instead, we assign our hero seven skills that come along with the progress in the game, we can develop. Moving around randomly generated locations (mostly dungeons) kill hundreds of enemies, collect treasures and avoid traps. A variety of weapons includes swords, axes, and magic. During the game we are able to combine items and create them, such as healing potions or better weapons.8/10			",162,47,4,47,22,2,55

												Warning, if you've never played this game, minor spoilers ahead. (Like, really minor, but spoilers nonetheless.)This game is a unique combination of simple, easy, difficult, relaxing, laid-back, humorous, and just general old-fashioned fun. Holy crap it's fun. Basically you crawl your way through levels of the dungeon to get to the main bad-guy, accumulating a number of unique and silly items, skills, and badassery. Levelling up always feels good, and gaining a skill almost always has a noticeable affect on your combat.Fair warning, you will die a lot. And if you're like me and love pain, you'll play on perma-death (which is optional). On about my fifth character, I was really getting into the swing of things. I had tons of items. I had a pocket dimension I could go to to dump unwanted detritus that might be useful in the future, and I'd just made it through the second floor (still haven't seen the third; the floors are fairly big and ooze with content and monsters). I was fairly powerful at this point, at least for the floor I was on, and easily laid waste to waves of monsters with the help of my zombies and clouds of poison that I conjured. So, feeling like a badass, I hopped over to my pocket dimension to drop off some loot, when I noticed that from said dimension I could also leap to other dimensions! ""Okay, cool,"" so I did. Plowed through one small dimension, no sweat. So I go to another, run into two monsters, kill myself with my own poison cloud. It was my fault for not paying attention, but alllll the hard work, the several hours I'd put into his skills, levels, items. Gone!At that point I said to myself, ""Okay, this is probably the point where going back to the first dungeon just becomes a tedious grind, and I won't want to play anymore."" Well tonight I felt like trying again, trying some new skills. Frankly, it's no less fun than when I played for the first time. The floors are all randomly generated, so it's never the same run between characters.My current character has kicks that literally explode into fire, tearing through enemies like nothing, and I'm only on the first floor.It's not just the content, it's the little quirks. You can tell the developers had a blast making this game. Everything shines with creativity and humour, and it's just a lovely little game gah I love it.10/10, recommended a thousand times yes. It's cheap, you should buy it with the expansions. Get ready to lose at least a few hours a day.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												 A nice little dungeon crawler. Though it certainly isn't for those ""Oh I died, this game is obviously broken"" people. This game is cruel. It is clear from the first step you take that the game wants you to die, and if you get to the 10th level without your highscore table filling to the brim, then kudos to you and your epicness. If oyu're looking for an easy, slow game, don't look here. If you're looking for a story-driven RPG, don't look here either. But if you're here looking for a cruel, addicting and unforgiving game, with nice cartoony graphics, and some of the best humour I've seen in a game in years, look here.			",228,23,4,43,17,2,54

												I've also put in plenty of not steam time on Dredmor.Am a big Roguelike fan, and besides the Diablo series, I usually have usually stuck to Angband and the like. I love the ascii look, but the tilesets and animations really add something to the turn based crawling.Super fun dungeon crawling, tense and hilarious situations, lots of skill trees and spells and attributes to tweak, as well as the workshop for new of all of the above make the game very worth it.

												This game has many good things going on for it. It has the potential to be an amzing roguelike. Yet it falls short for four reasons 1) Lack of depth. A major part of roguelikes is exploration, synergies and ""huh thats cool"" moments. ToMe, ADOM, NetHack, Caves of Qud and many others excellent roguelikes do this well.2) Graphics; although this purely a personal compalint, but i can look at an @ sign for hours but the terrible walk animation I can not.3) Difficulty, the difficulty jumps incridably steeply, without giving players a good indicator of why, a chance to adapt or means of survival.4) The games length is artificially extended by grinding out enemies and clearing floors to deal with the difficulty cruve.That being said this game simplicity makes it an excellent roguelike introduction to players new to the genre as they wont be swamp with complicated numbers and stats.

												Игра от бога.Во-первых это рогалик. Хочу сказать не самый дружелюбный к игроку рогалик, как например Rogue Legacy. В этой игре первые пару часов вы будете бесконечно умирать от ловушек, попадать в западни и, не дай бог, встретить комнату, полную монстров (Monster Zoo). Зато потом почуствуете всю ее прелесть: игра дает нам возможность самим делать персонажа. В игре предложены несколько десятков черт вашего персонажа, большая часть которых потом сможет развиваться как самостоятельная ветка скиллов. Все это дает нам возможность создать как самых стандартных персонажей, типа мага, война, рыцаря, так и совсем странных, как, например, войн-вегетарианец, по совместительству адепт огненной магии, турист и криминальный следователь. Звучит забавно, не так ли? Это не все, что заставит вас улыбнуться в этой игре. В Dungeons Of Dredmor юмор присутсвует везде: в описании предметов, врагов и умений. В этой игре время, которое проживет ваш персонаж, зависит только от игрока, от того как быстро и хорошо он умеет ориентироваться в той или иной ситуации, как он изучал умения, да и как ведет себя в бою. В игре почти нету места рандому, разве что банальная генерация локации и монстров. Не стоит забывать и про музыку! Она тут отличная. К сожалению самих композиций тут не так и много, но все они очень качественные и самое главное — приятные на слух и подходят под игровую атмосферу. Если тут есть ярые любители собирать ачивменты, то их тут предостоточно, причем как минимум 10 из них займут у Вас не меньше сотни часов. Могу смело посоветовать всем любителям хардкорного игростроя купить DoD, а лучше со всеми вышедшими дополнениями, как по мне, так она эта игра того стоит. ",101,19,4,15,10,1,17

Easy to pick up and play, full of all the things the genre's known for (tons of loot, brutal difficulty, random dungeons), TONS of replay value via a large array of skills and craftables, and above all: it's absolutely hilarious.

												Dungeons of Dredmor is an excellently done Rouge-like RPG game. With the huge ammount of different skills, all of which are completely unique, all the references in the game and also all the humor that is in it, the game feels like no other one. All the expansions (DLCs) are really well done and it feels that they are actually a big part of the game. My favourite DLC (or expansion) is ""Conquest of the Wizardlands"", adding the ability to customize your pocket dimension, find magical graffiti in the dungeon and use the codes from the magical graffiti in your pocket dimension to open ""Portals to distant lands"", one of them being the ""Diggle Hell"". Dungeons of Dredmor is one of the best RPG games I have ever seen. It is addictive as hell, you can play it always and it never gets boring, because every time you play, the dungeon is completely different. The reason why it's not a 10/10 is that I would like to see the gear I wear on my character when it is equipped. That feature feels missing from the game. Final Rating: 9 / 10MUST OWN			",138,18,6,19,6,0,22

												This is a Roguelike done right: you can play casually and die horribly in a thousand ways and that's fun. Or you can take it a bit more seriously and get really close to winning before dying horribly and that's frustrating fun. Or you can play really really seriously and actually win the thing and that is freaking awesome. But however you play there's good art, excellent music, and tons and tons and TONS of items with great descriptions for you to read through. Add on the crafting system and all the skill trees and this game is basically just built out of replayability.			",83,58,0,30,31,2,47

												Excellent game. The screenshots and trailer didn't make me want to play this, because the whole game looked so overly simple. How wrong was I? The animations are cute and detailed at the same time and the gameplay itself is quite complex, and can be extremely hard even. Even though the game presents itself as a humorous turn-based dungeon crawler.I just love exploring every part of the dungeon. Until I get myself in trouble that is, which usually doesn't take all that long. You'll die a lot in this game so it's advised to safe often. But somehow dying never frustrates. You'll just load your savegame or start an entire new game. Both choices can be fun. So... Like I said; excellent game. Highly recommended ![Rating: 77/100]			",1661,635,69,222,194,16,225

												Very nice and addictive dungeon crawler with pretty comic-like graphics and oldschool gameplay mechanics. In short - it's like a little big game. Tons of items, skills and vast (randomly generated) dungeon to explore with loads of easter eggs and humor.			",188,44,3,34,21,2,37

												A great rogue-like with tons of humor elements that make it a bit more entertaining. There's lots of (silly) skill trees and Steam Workshop has some great mods for skill trees and one great thing for more items. It also has graphics which is a big step forward for rogue-likesP.S. It is a true rogue-like, okay? not a rogue-like-like but a rogue-like? it's not like a like a like a rogue-like but it's plain rogue-like with rogue-like permadeath and rogue-like turns and rogue-like random generation. Rogue-like.			",197,23,4,22,12,2,32

												This is one of those games where you may have to give it some time and practice until you fully understand it and have a blast with it. It's like munchkin the roguelike. if either of those words makes you happy, then hop onto Dungeons Of Dredmor! I would highly recomend getting the complete pack as it add many things to the game to make it that much more fun. Not to mention the cost of this game is really cheep! Prepare to die many times and have fun doing so!			",158,26,4,19,14,1,13

												The perfect game for any e-emo and otherwise suicidal and/or masochistic person out there :ONothing screams ""FUN"" in your face like dying over and over to random nonsense and that's what this game is all about. Less complicated than the usual Rogue-likes (which I can't name any of, because I don't play such things..I only heard the term before and wanted to use it myself to appear knowledgeable enough to actually recommend this game), this game has a great sense of humor and lots of replay value. Also one of the dlcs is actually for free, so...The whole thing is cheap as heck, but I digress...So you wander around a random dungeon and try to stay alive long enough, to be able to unleash a lot of rage once you die after lots of wasted hours. If all that hasn't sold you yet, you are a sane person. I do recommend :O			",377,186,6,94,37,5,61

												Want to get into Roguelikes but don't know where to start? Look no further. Dungeons of Dredmor is what a roguelike would be if all roguelikes didn't make an effort to be as unappealing as possible. Make no mistake, this is not an easy game by any means. You will die often, but the game's great comedy, music and design will keep you coming back for more.			",132,11,0,15,5,0,9

												Dungeons of Dredmor is a graphical roguelike that parodies popular culture and roguelikes in general. It was released in 2011 by Gaslamp Games. Like most roguelikes it has procedurally-generated dungeons as well as a lot of monsters and items for the player to discover. Your task is to venture down into the unknown and vanquish the Dark Lord Dredmor.There are three expansion packs available for Dredmor: Realm of the Diggle Gods, You Have To Name The Expansion Pack and Conquest of the Wizardlands. These bring more starting skills, monsters, levels and items into the base game and are all recommendable.+Very replayable.+Lots of humorous references.+Challenging, especially on hardest difficulties.+A huge selection of starting skills.+An easy-to-use interface.-Some builds are very overpowered and some can be practically impossible to win with.-Tends to slow down when there are many enemies and items on the screen at once.-One Steam achievement is bugged and one is practically impossible to get.And remember:LUTEFISK FOR THE LUTEFISK GOD!

												This game was recommended to me by one of my friends. He absolutely rants and raves about how much fun he has with it... I'm not sure that we should be friends anymore. This game is extremely boring. The enemies are simple recolorings, the combat is not challenging other than trying to stay awake, and the levels are bland.The humor in the game is slightly funny at first... But this is not enough to keep anyone interested on this alone. The battle mechanics are repetitive and the only real strategy is to funnel the enemies into a hallway where they can't attack more than 1 or 2 at a time and hack away. The graphics are HORRIBLE. A few floors in the background/floor/wall/everything looks like a gravel driveway with vomit mixed in.At some point, I stopped playing the game, and just started seeing how many characters I could create with some form of ""eyebrow"" in their name... And then I shelved it....  Overall, I'd say if you've never played a top down turn based roguelike, or if you want a reason to never play  another top down turn based roguelike, maybe pick this up when it's on sale. If you want a game that will keep you interested for more than half an hour without feeling like repeatedly clicking on an icon in windows 3.0, pass this up completely. ",159,39,0,26,17,0,19

												I've been playing turn-based RPG rogue-likes since Nethack and Zangband.  This game does alot of interesting things with the procedurally generated dungeons. By the time I got to character level 10 on dungeon level 5 I was so incredibly bored with the gameplay that I accidentally didnt watch my health bar and died.The difference between my experience with this game and others is that when I accidentally died I was glad that I didn't have to play any more because it was so incredibly boring.If you like this game, just go download Nethack or Zangband for free. They dont have the graphical tiles but the gameplay is ten times better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I must say that I have been eyeing this game for a while, seeing it and its low price and thinking ""wow, that game doesn't look that bad and it's only five dollars."", but let me tell you, its worth way more. This game is so captivating and fun to play that I can just get lost in it, even though I have only been playing for roughly 4 hours. Today, my aunt told me if I watch her dogs until she comes home, she will pay me $10 an hour that I am here and I get to bring my computer. This game was a LIFESAVER because I have been here since 3:00 and its almost 11:00. One of the dogs is blind, so nothing to worry about there, and the other is a cripple, so nothing to worry about there either. Neither of them move and I would have been so bored but this game was so interesting with its skills that let you do a wide variety of spells and other such abilitys. If you like turn based RPGs, then this is the one if you want to know what an original classic is like. By the way, the Diggles are the best enemy ever they are so CUTE!			",131,7,5,21,17,0,2

												I love it. If you need a roguelike rpg fix, this is it straight up. If you prefer your roguelike a bit on the ""lite"" side you can turn off save deletion after death (thus no permadeath). There's so many elements that you get to chose when it comes to creating your character. Want a sword weilding mage that can smith and knows some alchemy and goes berserk often? Sure! Want a martial arts healing necromancer that can lob some fire around? Done.  I give this game a perfect score but also would reccomend some minor tweaks, they don't detract from the game in my opinion but would be nice. First off I would like more character graphics options. Hairstyles, colors, outfits etc. And perhaps a music filter so we can make sure our favorite of the game's clever soundtracks play. Best 6$ I've spent on here otherwise.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great entry level roguelike with a good sense of humour. Just as most of the games of this genre, it's fun as long as you're striving for survival. Once you find a self-sustaining skill build, get lucky with items AND don't do any mistakes, it becomes easy and kinda repetitive, but those are circumstances some players might never experience and therefore they could enjoy the game even more. I only wish monster zoos were either implemented differently or removed from the game. Other than that and some skill explanations being cryptic at times, it's a really good, polished game that I highly recommend.			",121,20,1,17,13,1,14

												It's a roguelike game....OK let's be more specific: Dungeons of Dredmor, I believe, is a perfect gateway into the roguelike genre, which is normally populated by games that are massively complex and nearly impenetratable to normal gamers, since those mainly used minimal graphics, user interface mostly designed for machines that are 20 years old or more and massive complexity which several games don't bother supplying adequate tutorials (and lots of newer roguelikes still opt to follow that tradition, though recent trends are going against that). Dredmor, though, evades all the above shortcomings pretty well, with good graphics, humor and good introduction to the game combined with complexity that is not too deep but is still deep enough.And after this maybe you want to try more roguelike games!

												The best game I have ever played in twenty years of computer gaming, bar none (and I have played a LOT of games). Eight years on I can still recall how profoundly that game gripped me, and I am not an overly emotional person. You will care about the characters, you will be moved, you will make choices that tell you more about yourself. It sounds trite, I know, but it really is that good. If only someone would make more of these...insightful, intelligent, devastatingly creative. Fallout is the only RPG to come close. A word of warning: You MUST read all the text, explore all the dialogue options, if you are to gain the most from the game. A decent intelligence and wisdom score is recommended.....although so is a decent score in everything else....the game does the best job of making usually superflous statistics genuinely useful that I have ever seen. Still very much worth playing.			",161,27,1,45,12,2,32

												One of the most fun rogue-like games I've ever played, the one that got me into rogue-likes too if I'm being honest, there's so much great about it too.  The crafting, the skill lists, the ability to basically build your own character, the expansions.And it's only $5 now?!  If you don't have this yet you have no excuses aside from ""I didn't know it was a thing!""Seriously, this game is great.  Only real flaw is if you have a low resolution monitor, your vision-range will be capped to your monitor size. :(			",394,68,7,64,48,5,91

												7/10Very cute game! Great fun. The developers work super hard to fix any bugs relatively quickly. Buy this single-player game and enjoy every minute of it! The money is well-deserved to these guys.  Expect this game to be full of humor, adventure, and lots of grinding. On the other hand there's a few DLC(not sure if they're worth the money) and I know that these types of games can get old after awhile. It did for me- but I'll be back one day! Maybe.

												I never thought i'd like a Rogue game, but i do, and it's this one.I mostly play games where i can level up and save and load when i have to, i get stressed and depressed and angry when dying hardcore-mode. But DoD is fun!Lives can stretch for a long time and there are several skills to explore and combine and they are all cool.Graphics and music is mediocre, but that doesn't matter. The more you play the more you learn on what to do and more importantly what NOT to do. But read a wiki after a game or two to learn more is my advice.Sure, i can recommend this if you like RPG and a challenge.			",752,262,30,159,98,4,190

												Fun, funny, and quirky, DoD can be played either as a roguelike or as a classic, turn-based dungeon crawl/RPG with a nice crafting and skill tree system. Permadeath is an option you can disable at character creation if you want to get a feel for the game before diving into the pitiless world of the roguelike. Variable difficulty settings also help with this.The main downside to the game is that, although there is plenty of variety in terms of items and skills, not so much in terms of gameplay. The game is an unbroken progression through floors of the dungeon that are virtually identical except for different tilesets, and enemies are regularly recolored and recycled. There is no ""town"" or ""overworld"" to speak of, although there are shops. Still, the game is absolutely worth it, especially at the bargain price. Why are you still reading -- just buy it.

												This game will reel you in to play hours and hundreds of hours of exploring vast dungeons, learning various skills and slaughtering numerous monsters. It is probably as user friendly as a roguelike game can get. You will enjoy this game if you like oldschool RPGs, wacky sense of humor and crossing your fingers in hopes of getting a nice sword out of a smashed open chest.Очень няшный рогалик с кучей лута, скиллов, циферок, буковок и безумства.

												This game is awesome, it's a great way to get into a rogue like game that has good graphics and so much depth. I always had a slightly passing interest in rogue but this is on a whole other level. I've probably spent just as much tims playing the game as thinking about which build I should go that would get me far into the dungeon. Get bored of the game and there is a ton of community created content. It's not an action game, you have to think about your moves but it is still really intense.

												Dungeons of Dredmor is buoyed primarily by its humor and challenge. There are hundreds of jokes and original content to be discovered throughout the game which keep it interesting. A game like this would likely grow stale after a few playthroughs, but the inclusion of workshop mods increase its lifespan immensely.			",44,8,0,8,10,1,16

												If you long for the old days of pixel graphics and dungeoneering or just like turnbased, really entertaining RPGs in general, you should definitely check this one out. It's intended to play like a classic Roguelike, but you can also turn off permadeath and just have fun with it as a normal RPG. The selfaware humour, the different character builds and the random dungeons will keep you entertained for quite a while! As of this writing, the game still has a couple of bugs that can be quite a nuisance, but the developers are very active and responsive about issues, so that's also a plus. The game also has very good mod support and a healthy community providing new content. For what little money this costs, you get quite a lot of value. Worth a look for sure!			",458,162,7,76,54,5,67

												This is by far one of, if not the, best roguelikes. It's got all the staples; permadeath (optional), difficulty levels, dungeon crawling, randomised level layouts, and different skills that let you customise your build. The skills aren't the typical RPG '+1' stat boosts, they're actually interesting and unique, and they combine with skills from other trees to make a huge variety of ways to approach the game. And you have just one objective; get to floor 10 (or 15 with the DLC enabled) and kill Lord Dredmor.It's challenging, but not essentially impossible like so many roguelikes. Because it's turn-based and offers plenty of different skills, there's plenty of ways to tackle this one. I love that the weapons, trinkets and armour (of which there are many) are static and not procedurally generated. This means you can go hunting for a particular item you need for your build or to deal with a given type of enemy. And when you come across that super rare, super powerful weapon...An amazingly good game. On top of it all, the game has a great sense of humour. Sure, it's a little rough around the edges. I'd love a bit more variety in the level randomisation. But as they're an indie developer I'm happy to cut them some slack. And it's so cheap; just give it a shot!			",220,42,2,29,34,4,47

												This game is a TRUE rougelike. As in follows the same gameplay format as the original Rouge. Compared to Rouge however, Dredmor is a lot more accessible and takes itself less seriously.Dredmor is good. It's a GREAT place to start if you're looking to get into true Rouge games, or even before all the Rouge-like variations as it is very much more forgiving (there's a non-perma death setting ;) ).

												When I started playing this game, I liked it, but the more I played the more I realized how boring and uninteresting it is. First of all, there are many technical problems with the engine. Crashes (with an achievement), bugs and input lag are always part of the experience. I never bothered with the non-permadeath mode but If you play this mode, the game is completely broken due to crashes corrupting the save file.The humor in Dungeons of Dredmor is something most people seem to be in love with but I found it to be uninspired, unoriginal and not funny in any way. The more hours I spent playing, the less patience I had with the game's poor performance and input lag. These two issues are simply awful and unbearable after a while. Worst of all is the crafting and lack of a decent enough inventory system. If you make a character build focused on crafting, you will be in for the most frustrating, annoying, cumbersome experience in any crafting related game. It's so poorly implemented and backwards that once you go through the troubles of attempting to keep ingredients/items, organize them and finally begin crafting, you will never want to craft another item in this game again. The negative combination of the awful inventory system and the hideous crafting system is enough to quit playing and never go back to Dungeons of Dredmor again. Sure, the game could certainly be played using other builds and you don't have to craft anything to beat it, but the horrendous inventory system is still there and there is no way of making it less painful to organize, keep and use items. Dungeons of Dredmor could have been so much better if the developers spent more time polishing and tweaking many of the major issues the game has.Dungeons of Dredmor is mediocre.

												Very well-written dungeon crawler. The dev obviously has a good sense of humor and put together a pretty interesting game. No fancy graphics or elaborate quests/puzzles, but entertaining nonetheless. If you like the type of game that makes fun of itself, then this is for you. Some of the skills/classes are a bit...overpowered...while others are practically useless, but they still offer a ton of replayability and I'm sure that there are lots of build combinations I haven't even come across yet.

												When I started playing this game, I liked it, but the more I played the more I realized how boring and uninteresting it is. First of all, there are many technical problems with the engine. Crashes (with an achievement), bugs and input lag are always part of the experience. I never bothered with the non-permadeath mode but If you play this mode, the game is completely broken due to crashes corrupting the save file.The humor in Dungeons of Dredmor is something most people seem to be in love with but I found it to be uninspired, unoriginal and not funny in any way.

												I got this as part of the Humble Indie Bundle #4... I had no idea what a ""roguelike"" was, but I thought the art looked pretty silly and decided to give it a try.  Within 10 minutes, I knew I was in for a long haul of booze-fueled spell casting and Diggle whipping.  On the surface, the game seems rather unappealing: Stricly turn-based; very minimal animations; dry, flat, squared-off environment; absolutely simple controls and mechanics.  And it is hard -- very hard.  I died, and continue to die, a lot.  And death is permanent for your character and his progress to that pointBut beneath the surface, the game is a refreshing and compelling peice of work.  The instrinsic randomness of nearly every game element means that each replay is its own truly unique run filled with delightful surprises and totally unfair que-sera-sera situations.   I'm out of room.  This game is a bargain - buy it, love it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This isn't a terrible game, so consider it a mixed review, but after 30 hours in and not wanting to play anymore and not very excited about it, I can't rate this positively for a rogue-like game.  I will note, though, that if you generially like the idea of ""rogue-likes"" but are mostly turned off by lack of feedback/graphics/music, this is a good game to get into the genre.Quick review:Pros:-Varied builds-Lots of loot-Very good music-Good graphics-Standard hard rogue difficulty curve-Cute mechanics like monster horde roomsCons:-Very repetitive, imagine a single player only diablo-Catastrophically bad inventory management-Grindy as heck, even on the no grind game option (lol)-Not very well balanced-Surprisngly simple for a rogue gameDetails:Possibly the worst part of the game is the inventory management.  This sounds like a weird gripe, and I've played lots of games with terrible inventory management and just dealt with it, but this is definitely the worst inventory management in a game I've ever seen.  Basically you've got somewhere on the order of 1000 different item types in the game, and all can be used to craft stuff, but you can only hold onto 60ish items at a time.  Sure you have a dimensional stash that you can visit any time, but with that many item types, you'll be visiting it every 3 minutes.Even choosing a no-crafting skills build, which seems to be the only option, its still surprisingly annoying to deal with given you need food and booze of which there's like 100 types.  So then it comes down to choosing builds that don't craft and use vampirism (no food), and don't use throwing or crossbows,  just to play the game without going insane.Next up is the repetitiveness.  Most roguelikes have unique enemies with interesting abilities, enviromental hazards, and their own brew of general randomness to spice things up.  This game is mostly just stacking on various resistances and bonuses and dealing with your enemy's resistances and bonuses.  You look at the forums, and most build discussion is even just about choosing builds that let you stack certain stats.  This kind of munchkinery is super fun for about 15 hours or so, but it gets old really quick.  When you combine this with the fact that a floor takes about an hour (half an hour on ""no grind"" lol) and there's fifteen floors, and you're mostly just spamming the left mouse button, I think a lot of people will just get bored.  Even with the builds that implement some form of strategy, it's going to be the exact same strategy for any situation.There's some major balance concerns as well, although since it's single player, you can just opt out of using the overpowered crap or choose random builds.

												This game is opposite from most games I played in a very nice way. To begin with, every time I die, and that happened frequently, I’m happy that I can start a new game. Because the game is fair and always when I have to start over, what is certainly a pleasure, I know it’s my own fault.The music in this game is exactly what I want to hear in a game like this. It’s a way too much orchestra song kind of music what really give the feeling of a middle age castle period. Call to arms and conquer!! Tadadum tadum tadum…Very good choice!The interface and menu is very detailed and clean. Compared to the graphics of the dungeon itself it’s modern style. The dungeon is old style, but with enough diversity and eye candy to not feel boring or repetitive. Even that the dungeons are randomly generated every game plays like his own story. Every random set up is like handcrafted by an experienced level designer. The placement of monsters and goodies is a surprise every time, but always very well balanced. Behind every door you open on a gigantic random map is a whole new game generated before your eyes. Within every room dozens of monsters to fight and dozens of pick-ups to find. Every character you build, chosen from tons of skills yourself or totally randomly, is unique. But really unique. Not unique because the skill you are good in blocks your access to all other skills, but because the skill you develop really makes sence. Every skill point you spend for a skill is game play changing in real time.Another very good balanced, well designed aspect of this game is that for the first time (I played hundreds of RPG’s and TBS games) you can use all your skills on many, many places of every map.The fighting is fun, fast and rewarding and it’s even turn based, so you really have time to make every turn and every action you make count. Also it’s very easy to understand and again perfectly fair for the AI and for the player. Fast because every action is just one point, so your turn or the computer’s turn doesn’t take more than a second to make. What is also groundbreaking is that the turn based gameplay in battles and the exploring part of the map is seamlessly. So you don’t have to push the end turn button a thousand times if you are not in a fight but exploring the map.It was running flawlessly the first few hours after installment and without any glitches, lags or crashes on a three years old laptop with a build in video adapter.The only bad thing was that one time I had to kill my own summoned monster, a golem, myself because he was blocking my only way out. This was done in a second, but it was just horrible to kill my own loving pet with my axe.This game is also original in many ways. The art, the item and spell description and the subtle, delicate jokes all around the game. Sometimes just written on walls or as little text balloons above NPC’s or monsters. But again it is done so balanced and it fit so naturally in the rest of the game.The last time I walked from my PC to take a piece of paper to write a secret code on it to gain access to a secret portal was 15 years ago. Cést magnifique!This game is just brilliant in many ways and I can only thank the developers to let me play this game for a few bucks. It’s really worth more! ",135,79,8,127,92,4,129

												A strange but potent combination of humor and dying, both of them in immense quantities. DoD is a whimsical, sometimes downright sadistic game, throwing you into startling deathtraps at a moment's notice, while perpetually referencing and parodying roguelike genre conventions in most wacky, even disturbing ways. DoD does all this while being remarkably fun and addictive. It's superfluous mentioning replay value in here as it is staple of the genre.			",427,109,15,66,23,10,45

												It's slow-paced, brutally difficult, and not very pretty.And I love it.This is a throw-back to Castle of the Winds, NetHack, and any other rogue-like you can think of. This will not be a game that you're on the edge of your seat playing. It requires much more methodical planning and strategy. With the combinations of skills you can use, it is incredibly deep. Some combinations of skills make the game borderline impossible, but once you get your feet wet, you'll have a good idea of which skills work with which other skills. Don't forget that permadeath is the default, so if you don't want your save files to be deleted when you die, make sure to turn that feature off.I love this style of game, so this gets a 9/10 from me. If you like this genre, you can easily sink 200 hours into this game and still not see everything.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love the game to death, but all the bugs that cause it to crash and close are rediculous. I've lost so many adventurers to crashes it's not even funny. Speaking of bugs, there are also bugs that force you to move in one direction after closing the skill tree or closing the window you get after beating a zoo, and there are times where you can't load any previous auto saves, or..hell, any save at all without it just taking you back to the title screen. Great game, just plagued by awful glitches that need to be fixed. Please.			",226,34,5,42,15,2,22

												Wow, I bought this game on a whim because I am looking forward to their next game Clockwork Empire.  I never thought I would love this game.  I love it.  It's silly nature and entertaining gameplay make this a must have for any rogue-like fan out there.  The thing that really shines in my eyes are the skill tree's. They are fun and zaney and some of them will modify others and some work so well together.  I only wish there were a little better animations associated with the fighting. IE I have a shield but it doesnt show one.  A few little things like that, but just that little things.  This game is well worth the small sticker price.			",143,50,2,40,34,2,48

												I don't recommend this game. For a roguelike, it drags on too long, like, WAY WAY TOO LONG. When every floor and every encounter feels so samey, and all the encounters just blend together eventually, your eventual death at the end of slogging it down for hours and hours will come from making a dumb mistake just because you're SO BORED that it's hard to pay attention.Nothing else in this game even needs consideration, it's all overshadowed by that one point. I just want to see the ending, but the incredible patience required to slog your way there is the true test, and it's one you DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR.			",102,52,0,26,17,2,19

												I don't understand why this game is so popular.  Sure, it's cheap and is good-humored, but it just didn't do it for me.  If I had to put my finger on it, I think it's that it relies too heavily on the random number generator.You have no control over what items vendors are selling or what quest rewards you'll get or what crafting materials or recipes are available in any particular run.  You just repetitively kill enemies and get strung along for the ride hoping that the random number generator is kind to you.  Not my idea of a good time.			",20,6,0,7,10,0,10

(its a type of magic)The game can be brutally tough at times though, but not enough to keep you from coming back for more punishment.

												Not recommending it may seem a bit harsh. The game is funny, the graphics nice for the genre, there's plenty of depth and it is original in many ways. For the price I paid (part of a Humble Bundle) and the £3.49 it is on Steam, it is very, very good value.However it is flawed. It is so slow to play and there's so much repetition of doing the same thing i.e. fighting - which is a problem common to many turn-based roguelikes but overcome by most with instantaneous response enabling quite large battles to be resolved quickly. Sadly this is not the case with Dredmor, making the early levels quite laborious on repeat play throughs. Since it is a permadeath game, I soon tired of trudging my way through the early levels and soon put the game into my archives.You won't be wasting your money buying Dungeons of Dredmor, but if you want a game that will draw you in and keep you coming back for more, I'd be surprised if you found it here.

												The forgettable adventures of whateverYes I know rogue-like games are light in the story department, but this game is so severely and conspicuously lacking a story that I have to mention my disappointment somehow. It would have been so much better if it was accompanied by a whacky story to fit the mood but, as good as the mechanics of the game are, the soul is not there.Diablo had a consistent mythos that sucked you in the atmosphere of dread and more (yeah just wrote that). Compare it to this game which breaks the fourth wall so much that it is like it’s calling the player an idiot to his face and expect you to like it.I tried several builds to find some redeeming factor to my wasted time on this game and FORCED MYSELF to finish it after wasting many hours in it and I must say that I did not get any satisfaction from it.If you are looking for the fleeting thrill of leveling up a character and looting some treasures, then this game is for you, just be aware that there is not a world to immerse yourself in, just a forgettable experience. IMHO this game is not worth the time invested on it, the aftertaste is bitter and disappointing. ",72,14,0,17,2,0,2

												It's cute and charming, but rather shallow. There are so many better quality rogue-likes out there. This one has better graphics than most, but they're not that great. The only thing it has going better than most is the crafting system. Other than that, everything seems a poor imitation of real rogue-likes. If you are new to the rogue-like genre, this could be for you. But for experience players who like a little more depth, this doesn't cut it.			",50,15,0,13,9,0,13

												Humor. Dungeons of Dredmor has plenty of it. Item descriptions are absurd, enemies are bizarre, damage types are ridiculous, and the monsters frequently spout flavor text that will elicit a chuckle. The game takes nothing about itself seriously, and I LOVE that.Dredmor also has an amazing class selection system, being one of the most varied ones I have encountered in a game. You are given a plethora of skills to choose when you make a new character. Mixing potions, dagger adeptness, vampirism, communism, emo magic—the list goes on. Each of these corresponds with primary stats (burliness, nimbleness, and sagacity to name some) and secondary traits (dodge chance, block chance, and enemy dodge reduction to name some). With the vast amount of skills that you can choose, there is a near infinite amount of variation in primary stat and secondary stat intensities as well as attacks that you can use.However, these two things cannot save this game from the abyss.The humor is fun when you first play, but it gets old after you’ve seen and heard everything.The combat is grindy as ♥♥♥♥, feeling like a hack-and-slash game even though this is turn based. There is no strategy. Fighting is heavily dependent on RNG and the game does not force you to diversify how you approach each encounter. All you have to do is use your three favorite attacks, run, wait for them to cooldown, and then repeat. Nothing is stopping you from fighting this way, so I cannot help but fight this way.The developers claim that there are “hordes of monsters never-before-seen in a video game” to be found here. Don’t be fooled. Only two enemy types exist: melee and ranged. The difference between each enemy in these categories is what types of damage they deal and what types of resistances they have. To top it all off, the creatures you fight are only reskins of things you already have seen with their stats changed slightly.Inventory management is horrible. To make this even worse, there are so many different variations of ONE item (bleu cheese, grated cheese, cheese log, etc.) that your inventory will quickly become cluttered with crap.Crafting is complex, but perhaps too complex. As with consumables and wands and ammo types, there are just too many different components that you can acquire and they are randomly generated. This will frequently make it difficult to craft anything meaningful.Only the first twenty to thirty hours of this game is fun. While that might sound like a lot, trust me, it is not. I should easily be able to squeeze at least a hundred hours out of this before I get bored, because the developers clearly say “Infinite replay value: choose from a selection of mind-boggling skills to create your character. A new gameplay experience waits every time!” The only reason I have played this for sixty eight hours is because I like to pursue challenges. But all while I played I could not sit still. I was bored—I knew I was forcing myself to keep going.If you still want to get this game heed my warning: complete it only once and leave with a good taste in your mouth.Verdict: 65%			",83,14,0,11,3,2,8

												Long ago, the Dark Lord Dredmor was bound in the darkest dungeons beneath the earth by great and mighty heroes. Centuries later, the magical bonds that hold him in place are loosening and his power grows ever stronger. The land cries out for a new hero, a powerful warrior or a mystic wizard like those spoken of in the prophecies of yore. What they have, unfortunately, is you... Step into the Dungeons of Dredmor! Embrace your destiny! Face evil of the likes the world has never known - the terrifying Swarmies, the undulating Thrusties, and the adoreable nest-building Diggles. Worship Inconsequentia, the Goddess of Pointless Sidequests, or try your luck as a devotee of the nameless Lutefisk God. Cast powerful magic learned from the dark business warlocks of the school of Necronomiconomics, or summon the Viking Runes of your ancestors to blast your foes with thunder and lightning! Discover the power that can be had by wielding a bizarre armament of devastating weaponry such as the Interdimensional Axe, the Plastic Ring, and the Invisible Shield (if you can remember where you left it). Wield shoes decorated by the Dwarven Glittersmiths, all of whom have now committed suicide because of their shame, and embrace the joys of destroying giant moustache-wielding brick demons with a mace decorated with tawdry, delicious bacon. While you’re at it, be prepared to die. A lot. In hideous, screaming pain that makes you throw your keyboard out the window. The Dungeons of Dredmor await. Are you ready for them?

												The gameplay seemed too slow for me, even for a roguelike, and the interface was clunky. For example: clicking on a found item does not add it to inventory, but picks it up with the cursor so you have to click on the player character to add it to inventory, but if you don't click on the square your standing on the item will drop on the square behind you. Also, you have to open two separate windows (character and inventory) to equip items.			",113,12,0,7,8,1,6

												Dungeons of Dredmor is not a bad game; instead, it's an amusing, well-intentioned game that lacks the polish and ease of play which we have come to expect from games.  The play style harkens back to the earliest dungeon crawlers, featuring randomly generated dungeons, punishing combat, and a wealth of customization.  It's charm lies in the witty, inane humor sprinked in everything; my personal favorite joke were the shrines littering the dungeon, where you could pray to the goddess of side-quests, and receive a random task.  I swear, it's much funnier than my lame description implies.  Nonetheless, it's difficult to reccomend for you to buy the game, as the gameplay is extremely clunky, especially item and spell management.  For items, you must click and drag every single thing in the game.  That means that when you come across a trove of 9 pieces of Lutefisk, you either have to click and drag 8 times, or get lazy and leave them sitting there.  It's simply frustrating.  Additionally, stats and related systems are poorly, if at all, explained.  It becomes a burdon to try to compare one piece of armor against another.  All-in-all, Dungeons of Dredmor is an entertaining series of jokes, that lacks the polishing necessary for today's game market.			",27,8,0,7,2,0,4

Product received for free
												Normally I like roguelikes. One of my friends gave me this game as a Christmas gift saying it was similar to one of my favorite games: Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup.Dungeons of Dredmor... basically works. That's about the only nice thing I have to say. It never crashed on me. It's... competent. It's also a boring slog with little else going for it.The enemies are all a series of boring palette swaps that work basically the same and never forced me to switch up my tactics even a little. The only challenge to them is the massive health pools they have for soaking damage.Discovering new regions is never interesting, unlike Stone Soup where new regions like the Orcish Mines, Slime Pits, or The Swamp actually had unique qualities, here I never look forward to moving on to a new floor because I know it'll be exactly the same as the last floor but with different wall and floor textures.The sense of humor is immature and won't stop bashing me over the head with how insipidly edgy it all is.The one saving grace of this game - the one thing it has that Stone Soup doesn't have and likely never will have - is the crafting system... and even THAT falls flat. On my main character I took all of the crafting skills in order to make the most of this system, saved up materials and built myself some badass weapons and armor.... only to find that if I'd just waited an hour I would've found the exact same thing (maybe even with some sweet random artifact powers) a few floors down just laying on the ground waiting for me, and then I could have put all those points into actually useful abilities like fireballs and axe maneuvers. About the only thing crafting is actually good for is getting easy access to crossbow bolts, potions, and other consumables. That's it.My advice is log off Steam, go to Google and search for Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup. It's way better than this game, and free too.Knight's Rating: 3/5: MEDIOCRE ",64,15,0,20,5,0,3

												I would be lying if I didn't say this was fun at the start. At first the game is charming. Then the charm wears off and you're left with a randomly generated cluster♥♥♥♥ that makes no attempts at even being winnable.How long this takes depends on how long it takes to roll an absurd unwinnable game, which doesn't take that long.I don't mind roguelikes, I love the genre - but Dredmor is the perfect example of what's wrong with the whole randomly generateed nonsense everyone loves to make. From the game actively mocking your loadout by generating completely useless equipment and items, to discovering that any and all elements you can use are actively negated by just about every enemy in the game. But heaven help you if you get hit with the ""Hidden Element""  , because nothing you have will -ever- defend you.On the bright side, it's a FAR greater step up than the likes of Hack, Slash, Loot which is an even worse roguelike.

												The devs wanted this to be funny and anticonformist, but they did it without ""balance"" and , as a result, the game is not funny, but ridicolous. The music of the main screen is ok, but the rest... it's something that just doesn't fit the game, and it keeps repeting over and over again. And if you manage to reach the second area, you'll get the same thing with different instrument assigned to the Midi channel scores, so yeah.. it gets boring pretty quickly.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dungeons of Dredmor is a cool concept, but unlike other roguelikes, the game isn't very challenging, and even outside that, the game is extremely bloated with way too many items. I didn't get very far in the game, but my experience with it was that the early floors were very easy and didn't require much thought, and it started getting really obnoxious having to manage all the items the game throws at you. You'll probably like the game if you don't mind those flaws, however.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The combat system they pulled out of an old Lord British game called Ultima. To decribe this game as ""BOBO"" would be giving it WAY too much credit.

												So yeah. To start...This is one of my favorite Roguelikes. It's funny, smart, easy to get into, hard to master, has tons of replayability, and has a great, vibrent moding scene. If all you care about it gameplay, that's what you should take away from this review.Sadly, the developer, Gaslamp Games, has recently come out with VERY strong anti-gamer rhetoric. They have decided that not only is there no reason to fight for ethical, honest journalism in gaming, but that they, as devs, should take it upon themselves to silence all critism, censor all honest discussion, and side with people saying things like ""Gamers are dead"" and ""All gamers are mysogonists.""It is sad to think that a company I once held in such high regard has secretly always held such anti-consumer, anti-customer ideologies. I am grateful that these tendencies have come to light, but I am sad to say I can no longer support their company financially, no matter how much I love their games. At the end of the day, if you are comfertable giving money to a company that actively dispises you, as a consumer, please, buy this game. But if you feel that your money should go to companies that actually value you as a customer or treat you, as a customer, with even the slightest shread of human decency, take your money elsewhere.

												Pros:  - It's a good intro to Rogelikes  - It's polished, the theme is consistent and I experienced no bugsCons:  - Repetitive, each level has the same mobs, just a different color  - There is little to no strategy in combat.  - While I thought the crafting was going to be promising, by the time you get enough materials, you'll have found half a dozen of the item you want to craft  - The only challenge in this game is  the final boss, which after such cake-walk of a game will likely cause you to rage-quit after two-shotting youI played through this game with very minimal difficulty and I can say that if you're a Rogelike fan who hasn't played this, skip it. It you haven't played a Rogelike before and want to take baby steps into the genre, this game might be for you. Word of warning, it's very repetitive.			",103,64,0,39,26,0,29

												Dungeons of Dredmore is funny, it has a lot of wit to it and deciding what skills you want to bring into the game is always a blast.But the buck stops there.- The game is poorly optimized often lagging on machines no matter their power level.- you cant change many options once the game has loaded- important options like being able to scroll through the battle log are not in the game (hope you didn't need to know if your attack did any damage, or who out of the 8 monsters on you hit you the hardest) Change the ui on the screen? Nope, you get to fear walking down in this game because you ui blocks anything below you so you will never know what's there until you walk headlong into it.- game has little annoyances that slow it down into a slog, like constantly having to pick things up manually (yes there is an auto option for pickups but its lackluster) or having to watch your screen like a hawk for traps because even though your character  can see them, he will happily walk into them like an idiot if you are not paying close attention.and finally the most damning problem of them all- THERE is a RIGHT way to build your character, and if you built them any other way you cannot win! At least not fairly.The final boss has only one real weakness so I hope you chose one of the skills at the start that let you capitalize on that, else your dead. Restart and try again from the beginning chump.This game has great potential but it lacks common sense and a large amount of polish that it needed it ever be worth your time. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Has an interesting graphical style, but really falls short, if you're a roguelike fan. No diagonal movement? Can't attack enemies simply by moving 'into' them? A not-quite-top-down perspective that causes walls to obscure the row above them? Animated movement you can't disable or speed up (a big one for roguelike 'vets' that don't want superfluous 'sparkle' that slows them down)?Sorry, can't recommend this. Even Hack, Slash, Loot, which I got from the same Humble Bundle, was more enjoyable than this, and it's arguably much simpler overall. The game is silly (I wasn't /cringing/, but I never actually laughed either, and there were plenty of jokes in even just the tutorial), but that does not nearly make up for its shortcomings when it comes down to actually /playing/ it.I have no problem with a game pushing the traditional boundaries of its genre, but it has to be in a way that /improves/ the experience, otherwise it just feels like the game is missing things. And that's how I felt the whole time I played.I know my total playtime isn't very long, but my problems are all with the core mechanics, which are present from the first minute, so I don't think this was hasty.The more you love roguelikes, the less I recommend this game for you. It's a decent My First Roguelike for those uninitiated into the genre, but that's about it.			",84,7,0,4,2,2,3

												Call it a player experience in extremely bad luck, but ultimately, I feel that the time I've invested into Dungeons of Dremor has been an utter waste. Having raised three characters, and having every single character's life end with random abrupt inescapable and arguably unfair situations has really soured me on the game. Just be aware before going in that when things go wrong in this game, it'll in all likelihood be unfair (swarmed by enemies out of thin air, overleveled enemies just randomly appearing and one shotting you, etc) and ruin any amount of fun you've had prior to that character's untimely demise. That said, Dredmor is an approachable roguelike that handles its systems nicely. It can seem overwhelming at first, but when boiled down, all those skills, items, and crafting come into play, there's nothing complicated about it at all. I just really can't recommend it myself given how abrupt and unfair every play through I've had has gone.			",280,60,2,29,8,1,17

												Pretty much the worst game I've ever owned... and I've owned a LOT of games.Not even the above-average attempts at humour can save the game from horrifically tedious gameplay. I love roguelikes but this one felt too random - as though my actual gaming ability was inconsequential. I suspect the whole thing might have been a lot more enjoyable with regular, pre-designed levels.			",201,74,7,31,22,7,38

												This is a rogue-like type of snack, the kind that you eat occasionally to fill in the time.The packaging goes for a different kind of vintage style, rather than merely slapping together a potentially ugly looking primitive style, it goes for the sort of old freeware aesthetic.It's chock full of jokes and humor, rather than trying to look bland and serious.It has a cute taste, although with complications...You start off enjoying it, although it's sometimes uncomfortable you enjoy it anyway, but if you dig down to the bottom or read reviews, the taste begins to sour. It still kind of tastes alright, but you just can't seem to enjoy it as you have before.Steer clear, before buyer's remorse kicks in.			",127,9,0,13,6,0,3

												Dungeons is a slow, repetitive slog through a series of large, characterless, procedurally generated maps. Character progression is severely lacking in depth. The skill system boils down to unlocking one active or passive skill per level in a sequence of linear offerings. The crafting system is unapproachable, excessively time consuming, and unnecessarily cumbersome due to the inadequate inventory management system. I regard this game as an inferior version of ""Sword of the stars: the pit""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Game #3 - Dungeons of Dredmor (PC)November 4, 2014Where to begin... Well, I guess let's try and figure out where and why I bought this game. That may shed a little light on how Dungeons of Dredmor (Further referred to as DoD) came to be in the 1K Game Stream Challenge.As best I can guess, DoD came with a bundle of games. Either some HumbleBundle or one of the other ""Value Bundles"" being sold by one of the flavor of the month Steam Key re-sellers on the internet today. See, the Indie Developers tend to get their games lumped together, because the consumer of PC games seems to like value above quality. This is not always the case, but unless your dealing with the likes of HumbleBundle, then you're probably going to find a few games in each bundle that equate to a happy meal toy.Let's start at the beginning. For the record, I knew nothing about DoD coming into the playthough. I literally couldn't have told you anything about the game. After playing it for 3 hours straight on cast, I can tell you it's a Rogue-like RPG Game, and that's about it. From the point I started playing, I was confused by the mass amount of loot just lying around. Some may find this interesting and want to pick up every little thing, but honestly it seemed more like a videogame about hording than adventuring. There is so much crap lying around that you spend far more time messing with the tiny inventory screen than the tool belt where you store important spells and skills. This seems boring and tedious, neither are what I consider a gaming experience. Even trying to figure out the crafting system was cumbersome and not intuitive.Now, I am a supporter of Indie Games and when it comes to Rogue-Type games, I love them!  Spelunky, Crypt of the Necrodancer and Rogue Legacy are amazing. The difference is they are mainly platformers, and this plays well with the Rogue style of death machines. You care very little in most cases that you have to start over. In DoD this can be a nightmare if you leave the Rogue option on. Starting over each time is hell if you've just lost an hour of crafting work. One final note, that may be just a gripe,  in the game the characters always look the same no matter what armor you equip them with in the menu. Metacritic's average complete argues against my finding with a 79 for overall reviews. I would probably have put this more in the range of 40-50 based on the issues I've stated above.The one area that DoD wins in is price. Being an Indie title, the cost of the game is going to be on the lower side of the scale. When I say the lower part of the scale, I mean less than $5 on steam everyday. The complete edition is $6.99, and has a decent offering of DLC. The other advantage to DoD is that it supports user mods from the Stream Workshop, which can really extend the life of any game. To be fair, I did not install any files from the Workshop. I can't say that I would recommend  buying the game, but if the opportunity arises that some bundle has the game, give it a try and see if you can find anything interesting from user generated mods.

												This game is probably great for people that bought this and enjoy it because of nostalgia or gameplay, but this game bothers me. I have to turn music off because of the soundtrack that I can not stand, and this game's graphics bother me. This game is empty to me because it has no redeeming qualities. This game has no flavour, they put lots of work into gameplay, but the rooms are just bland. I wish I could recomend this, but a few aspects of the game are to large of problems to recomend it.

												The slow sometimes mundane combat speed of this game makes me want to wish it wasn't on my game list. I usually give most games the benefit of the doubt and barrell through sometime annoying or frustrating mechanics to see the big picture, Dugeons of Dredmor is not the case. The character art in my opinion is kind of bland and not that special. The combat was not very inticing making moving around the map a chore. I didn't spend much time on this title but what time I did throw away made me sure that I wouldn't pick it up again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I normally like roguelikes, but this one just isn't for me. I think it's the overly long combat animations that kill it for me. I like roguelikes to be playable at my own pace, and I don't like being slowed down by watching repetitive animations every time I melee a monster. I also don't like the insane number of stat and resistance icons, of which I can never remember what any of them are. Normally I'm all for complexity in games, but I think this is a bit much!

												Dungeons of Dredmor is a roguelike. So you have random level generation, tile-based graphics, turn-based gameplay and permanent death. I'm not a fan of the turn based gameplay most of these games have. Although Dungeons of Dredmor can be played fastpaced, but you missclick a lot. Unless I missed a option you always need to play with a mouse beside the keyboard.The atmosphere the game creates also doesn't really click with me. It tries to hard to be funny. Which end up in lame enemies with an art style I don't like. The dungeons look fine and with better characters the game would look a lot more appealing. The music also doesn't help. It's annoying and repetitive. Dungeons of Dredmor isn't bad game, but it doesn't click with me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dungeons of Dredmor is overrated. I'm not sure why it is, but one thing's for sure: It's sure offset as hell.The gameplay itself is average compared to other dungeon crawlers, except for the fact that the game is almost impossible to play without taking the tutorial first. RPGs are usually easy to learn to play on your own, but DoD just flat-out crosses the line. To give you an idea, it takes you about 8 seconds to simply place a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ item in your inventory. There's an option for a quick place, but it barely makes a difference.The camera is offset to the point where it's risky to just move down. The GUI is in the way of almost the entire bottom screen, and there are no options to move it somewhere else or even just lower the size.Don't even get me started on the graphics. The graphics are as if Doom and Oregon Trail II had a baby and then proceeded to puke all over it. Maybe that's an exaggeration, but the screen is blurry, it's hard to make out what the monsters even are, and the main character. Ugh! Why did the developers make his eyebrows the size of the Titanic?Overall, I rate Dungeons of Dredmor a 4/10.			",56,4,0,7,14,0,5

												One if not THE best roguelike currently availiable. Reminiscent of the old MUDs almost in a way. The humor is self-depracitating and hilarious at times. But also you can wrack up the difficulty quite a bit to make it a surefire challenge. So it is both a casual and a hardcore game. One that suits the aspect of both quite well.

												Dungeons of Dredmor is a pretty good rogue-like. It's a pretty solid game with a lot of depth, a lot of replay value, and a lot of appeal. And it has a great sense of humor.It nails everything down and doesn't make it complicated. The only thing I can find with Dungeons of Dredmor is that it doesn't do anything different. That's not necessarily a bad thing. Why change what isn't broken? Overall, Dungeons of Dredmor is still a good game. You'll have a lot of fun min-maxing your character and trying to find the best loot. But sometimes, during the grind, you might ask, ""Is there more to this?""If you're looking for a good rogue-like and you have a lot of time to burn, get Dungeons of Dredmor. If you're looking to find something new in the world of Rogue-likes, this isn't it.			",821,290,19,116,69,6,135

												Addicting little RPG roguelike with lots of humor. Don't take the game seriously, DO play just a few more turns... just open one more room. Note: Game isn't as hard as it seems at first, but it does allow you to build a character that's nearly helpless. Pick a build with a melee weapon and some defensive skills or you'll die. Also it's hard to find the materials for crafting early but it gets to be very useful. Dying is a learning experience in this game, try not to take it too hard. ;3 Also if there's only 1 block between you and enemy, don't move. Hit space to wait 1 turn. They'll move into range and you get the 1st melee hit for free. Don't be afraid to run away and close doors on them. Highly recommand taking a skill with a ""teleport type move"". Oh just get the game when it's on sale and jump in. Die a few times, then read the wiki. ;3			",267,47,3,52,18,3,52

												Over 185 hours...I've played over 185 hours in Dungeons of Dredmor, and I'm still not tired of this game.  It's kind of hard to be, because the key idea to the game as a whole is ""randomness""  Every level, every enemy and item placement, even every skill if you choose to go that route is random, and it's awesome.  The randomness of it all creates a unique experience, even to the niche genre of roguelikes, that let's the player be cool with the experimentation of new character builds, new gameplay strategies, and new ways to die.  Dying happens a lot, by the way.  The game is so addictive though, you won't mind starting a new character, getting closer and closer to Lord Dredmor.  The humor of the game definitely helps that.  What also helps is the Steam Workshop feature, adding more depth to a game that already has it in spades.Over 185 hours in, and I'm still not tired of the game yet.  Still haven't beaten it either.  Maybe next round.			",417,60,6,86,6,2,42

												A basic single-player RPG game that sees you going on a play-by-the-numbers run through an evil warlock's dungeon to kill your way through all his minions, dodge and disarm the fiendish traps before then killing the warlock himself. Sounds generic, but the game's humour and plethora of funny achievements (even one for when the game crashes!), massive character skill customization, and most, of all the utterly unforgiving difficulty when played on ""permadeath"" (one life is all your character has, so use it well) instead of unlimited lives is the saving grace of this game. Played in small doses of an hour or two at a time it is a great timewaster and borderline addictive on the hardest difficulty to boot.I received this game as a gift, but its been on and off my wishlist for sometime due to its interesting quirks. Buy it when it's cheap and grab all of the DLC in one hit for the best experience. Mods also exist for this game, but there are none of note at this time (2013/04/29).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dungeons of Dredmore is a rouge-like dungeon crawler.You play as an adventurer going down into the Dungeons of Dredmore. You pick you gender and then choose a set of 7 skills before you are plunged into the randomly generated levels.The skill customisation is fantastic as you pick whatever you want and there is plenty of variety from the normal swords, assassination and magic training to moe obscure skills like fleshsmithing, tinkering, necromincomics. As you level up, you can improve these skills to higher levels. The skills can interact and synergise, making the system incredible deep and complex if you really think about it.Levels contain enemies, traps, loot, interactive objects with lore, shops, side quests and so on. There are lots of different items that you can collect and use, but you have a limited inventory and you DEFINITELY cannot pick up and use everything. Battles with enemies is turn based and there are many different types to encounter.You can choose how you want to play the game from the start: you can change the difficulty level, whether you want to respawn or not on defeat, whether you can even respawn on death or completely lose that character forever, start off with a completely randomised skill set or choose your own skills, etc.Replayability is definitely high and with 3 DLCs and plenty of user mods, you won't run out of things to do or play with Dungeons of Dredmore.Perhaps one of the best aspects to it is its humour. The game is hilarious and takes every opportunity to make jokes, poke fun at itself as an RPG and the archetypal features of RPGs (an example would be the character stats and the description for each stat), even making jokes about you as a player. It keeps the game fresh and entertaining all the time.It's worth picking up if you like rogue-like games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am a fan of NetHack, so when I found a more modern game in the roguelike genre that doesnt stray too far from traditional, i had to play it. If you have never played a roguelike before, keep in mind that you WILL die.. over and over. The goal is just to keep trying to get a bit further each time, and if that fails, hope you die in an interesting way. Instead of being tied to a class, you pick from a selection of physical, magical, and crafting skills. The dungeons are randomly generated each time, so you never know what you are going to find. I highly reccomend this one as an introduction into roguelikes, for anyone who doesnt know about them, and to those who love the genre, Why dont you have this already? Its pretty cheap too, which is always a plus			",105,60,1,45,35,0,25

												What can I say about Dungeons of Dredmor? Well, for one, it's one of my favorite games on Steam. I could spend countless hours playing character after character looting and exploring dungeon after dungeon, and never have the same experuience twice. I'm not kidding. Not even once have I found a room exactly the same. Talk about Procedurally Generated. The joy of this game does not come in any one category. There are parts of this game that, if anywhere else, would make for a horrid experience. The combat isn't that complicated, but it can be difficult, and it's always fun. Wearing a piece of clothing or weilding a specfic weapon doesn't effect your outward appearance, only adding (or subtracting) from your stats, so for people who like to see your appearance change it's a problem. Dungeons of Dredmor isn't like most other games out there, as you may have already guessed, but it is ery entertaining, and hours will go by without you even knowing it. There is so much content in this game, and of all the hours I have played so far, I have not made it past the second dungeon. Is this because it is difficult? Maybe a little. But the real reason is that the game is really really big. Too many different types of monsters to count, as many weapons, more items than I've ever seen in a game, and interesting text on everything.This game has a lot of pop culture references and stuff like that, so for people who hate that with a passion, this game probably isn't a good choice for you. But if you want a game that can make you laugh, that's really fun, and can let you waste away hours of your life, then this game is perfect for you. I highly reccomend this game.

												As someone who thought he wasn't a fan of roguelikes, I didn't have high expectations going in, but I haven't played a game as addictive as Dungeons of Dredmor in quite a while. It's not for everyone and there's zero story, but if you're a fan of dungeon crawling and building characters, this game will have you tinkering for quite a long time, trying out new skill combinations as you try to make it to the final boss. The DLC packs add a lot and definitely make the game more interesting and replayable. If that's not enough praise, I'll add this: usually when I finish reviewing a game, I uninstall it. But I'll be keeping Dungeons of Dredmor around.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2014/03/dungeons-of-dredmor.html ",218,34,1,18,6,3,28

												Ever wanted to delve into a dungeon and loot everything without the hassle of spending stat points, and coming up with a class? Then Dungeons of Dredmor is for you. You start the game by picking seven skills, all plainly described, and then you enter the dungeon to kill the boss. Sounds easy, right? Wrong. The game is forgiving, to a point. On the first level of the dungeon, you can make mistakes. Go down one floor though, and you will be eaten alive, spit out, and then have your brain sucked out with a straw.Combat is simple. Click on the enemy, and you attack. None of that ""Attack: Spin Dash: Slime A"" bullcrap. You can cast spells with a right click, and here's where it gets trippy. You cast them, and you don't miss. It's rare, if ever, for a death to be the fault of the game. You missed with your crossbow because you aren't that great at using them. You got blocked because you're not that strong. You died, because you stepped into your own AOE spell.Get this game. It's good.			",54,17,0,15,12,0,6

												If you're looking for a classic-feeling dungeon crawler with  a nice twist, this game's the one that you NEED! Not only is it hard, but it's just something else when you run into the monster zoos, evil boxis or even the Uberchests that force you to scour the whole floor just to open them. It makes it possible to be different than the standard sword-and-shield, but you can wield staves, spears, daggers, orbs, books, a stick of meat and much more.Nice to see a game go with the classic dungeon crawler mechanic while still making it random, and rewardign to go through the whole area.

												This roguelike game is fantastic. The game is chock full of humor and has a wide variety of awesome skills. Crafting, lutefisk transmuting, and discovering new areas, items, and enemies are all very fun. It's easy enough for almost anyone to pick up, yet difficult enough for you to go through several characters in a few hours. I highly recommend it, especially for fans of dungeon crawlers.

It have really deep complex about in-game inventory and etc.If you like to see what happen if you drink this drink or put something or use one of 200 skill in this game (which in the description somewhat not helpful for me)And you like to read things, this is the game for you.

												I'm pretty obsessed with this game. It's so much fun and being randomly generated guarantees a totally different experience each game. Definitely check out the DLC and mods in the workshop, they make it even better. Because who doesn't want Bowiemancy? Even if you get killed by a Diggle on the first floor, at least you'll get an achievement! DoD is a great game for when you have twenty minutes to spare, or ten hours. I've done super casual playthroughs and serious hours crafting and scheming. It's really cheap and totally worth it, so why not pick it up (and actually play for a bit)!			",124,132,0,21,22,1,17

												A rogue-like for the modern era, and despite the age of the genre with some quirky graphics and easier UI to work with it plays quite nicely even in the current environment of gaming. Perhaps the only flaw with the games it comes off as a bit -too- quirky at times - you'll know what I'm talking about when you see the names of randomly generated magical items or special 'elite' monsters. That aside though, the tongue-in-cheek nature of it takes some of the edge off the inevitable messy splatter death(s) you will experience time and again in your quest to reach the bottom. Make no mistake, this is a faithful recreation of the true difficulty of the Rogue-like genre, even when played on 'elvishly easy'! You want a challenge like that? Get this game.

												Rouge like dungeon crawler with rpg and skills elements...yup this is game sounds good already. Whats better is the flavor text and how funny this game can be while being a interesting game. I would recommend that you play this game on normal or rouge difficulty since the ""elves want to have fun"" difficulty is too easy and its better to challenge the game then breeze through it. But if u want an extra challenge theres a perma death system if u so choose to for that extra challenge. And with the workshop and mods for this game theres plenty of content for this game at a good price at that cant pass that oppurtunity.			",353,32,0,23,6,1,12

												This indie rogue-like dungeon crawling game simply sucks you in with :- random levels- dozens of statistics for your hero and weapons and items- instead of classes, you choose 7 ""skills"" where each skill has a couple of abilities (active and passive), making endless combinations for developing your hero- comedies and parodies on...everything- crafting, smithing, melting, alchemy...- challenges- and other interesting things...Great indie game!

												Thus far, Dungeons Of Dredmor feels like the most true-to-form Roguelike of recent years. Of course there are other games that feel more like the original genre--ASCII Graphics, mouse-less controls, ten thousand keyboard shortcuts--but that's not what makes a Roguelike good. The complexity of the genre is still there in Dredmor, but it's more accessable. All in all, if you need an introduction to the Roguelike genre, or simply want something you can take a bit less seriously but still enjoy as much as the Hack's and Dungeon Crawl's that are the current staple of the genre, Dungeons Of Dredmor is a good choice. Also, it's entirely worth the $5 pricetag. Don't bother waiting for a sale, if you think you'd enjoy the game.			",68,6,4,23,19,0,21

The world itself is quirky and crazy, with that difficulty curve that we of the roguelike world love so very much. With skills like 'Killer Vegan', 'Pastamancer', and 'Necronomics', the game begs you not to take it seriously... and then *destroys* you when you don't! I wouldn't have it any other way.

If you want a casual, chip-away-at-a-dungeon-as-you-will experience, Dredmor has that as well.Gameplay is walk and click. RPG elements keep each playthrough challenging in different ways, and a huge number of skills make the game replayable for a long time. The modding community, although small, is fervent and helpful to newcomers.An excellent example of the modern rogue-like. ",388,105,5,75,32,3,81

												Ye gods! What do the lutefisk gods want? Ten slabs of lutefisk burned upon their altars and nothing!Seventh character and third floor down into the dungeons, I was armed with the Murderous Shiv of Crowbars, and Interdimensional Axe, and a Crossbow Bolt of Mass Destruction. I was feeling good. So good, in fact, that I tried stealing the world's most amazing three-bladed sword from Brax, the salesdemon. Then I proceeded to flay his cheap suited form with it. Ecstatic, I frolicked through the loot - Bolts of Squids, a Cyber Construction Cone helmet, and a Steam Powered Mechanical Arm of Crushing that belonged to some guy whose name I couldn't pronounce.Then the Dread Collectors came.Pink, blubberous monsters with pot-bellies and devious Spanish goatees. I unleashed my Bolt of Mass Destruction from Cranky (TM), by automatic crossbow. It bounced off... The walls of the dungeon were rent apart by the force of the nuclear blast, and a handful of the Collectors lost a tenth of their health. I scurried down an aisle of shelves to form a choke point, and smeared poison on my new weapons. I chucked Flasks of Brimstone and Softballs. I turned on my Swashbuckling Auto-Counter ability. I ingested at least six different mushrooms, endowing me with lobstery skin, flannel, a beard, and the might of Chuck Norris. Then the first Collector reached me. I counter attacked him into a fine pink mist.With chants of ""Slay the eyebrowed one!"", the second Collector counter-criticalled me into next Tuesday with a vengeance as I tried to escape into my pocket dimension. I slumped down, blood pouring out onto the floor.BUY THIS GAME, BUT DO NOT, FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THE WONDERFUL LOOT IN THE DUNGEON, DO. NOT. EVER. SHOPLIFT.			",100,11,1,10,2,0,11

												While it does suffer some minor issues, and some major ones (perhaps I have been spoilt by dungeon crawl, but that's a free game and lets you go places by clicking on the minimap, rest until healed and autoexplore, all of which Dungeons of Dredmor could do with) it's overall a decent rougelike with humour, customisable skillsets and with the level of graphics and animations rougelikes mostly lack. If you aren't familiar with rougelikes, this one is more appoachable than most, but maybe try some of the more accessible free ones first to see if you like the genre.			",285,84,5,32,32,5,84

												Dungeons of Dredmor has amazing music, about a billion different items, and floors galore. It's a really fun game that has a different outcome every time you play. With a bunch of different classes to choose from and combine with other classes, this game gives a different experience every single time. I have to personally say that Dungeons of Dredmor is up there in my top 10 list of games I love.			",24,6,2,8,4,1,2

And to accomplish that (or vice-versa), the game bathes you in humor, which is good, nostalgy and an actually great RPG mechanic.Just take a look: a funny pixely dungeon crawler with perma-death, What else could you wish for?

												Modern rogue-like. This means better controls and ui, great inventory system, steady combat, and difficulty options. You can choose an easier mode and also choose a mode that lets you keep a save file to reload after death. Or you just play it the old fashion way, with permadeath and on highest difficulty. The options make it quite nice. There are plenty of skills to play around with. Tons of items. Each floor of the dungeon is unique. The graphics and writing are very playful. The little descritptions of everything are written with great care. Great game, kudos to Gaslamp(the developers) you guys knew what you were doing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You know how some people say ""I really want to like X, but no matter how hard I try I can't""?  Well, for me, Dungeons of Dredmor is the opposite.  I really don't want to like it.  It's a 2D rougelike, top-down, turn-based-ish dungeon crawler with an odd sense of humor (it's hit and miss) and a 90's feel to it.  While each floor is randomized, each room is a template of sorts, so after a few hours of gameplay, you'll start to see the same rooms pop up over and over (just with different loot sometimes).  It doesn't feel like there's enough content for a game like this.  And yet, I can't stop playing it.  On normal, the game is easy enough to lure you in until you find yourself suddenly dead (health is mostly gained by eating food, but it replenishes 1 point per turn (usually for 10 or so turns, depending on the item) so you need to be careful when getting into combat.  The enemies are unusual, yet somewhat bland, but they will sometimes insult you (via text above them) that is actually pretty charming (""You smell like diggle pee"" or ""I hope they nerf your playstyle"").  The biggest draw for me, though, is the item collecting.  There's all kinds of random loot to find, better equipment or something to sell for money so you can buy better equipment.  It's actually sort of relaxing.  All this on top of crafting (which could have been done better, to be honest), leveling and basic (go here and kill this mostly) sidequests that are there to parody the RPG genre.  Plus, you regain magic by drinking alcohol.In the end, I suppose Dungeons of Dredmor feels like a poor man's Torchlight, but I find it to be a little more likeable than Torchlight.  The music is good, the graphics are decent and it's pretty easy to pick up and play.  I recommend this game!			",164,53,2,11,24,1,32

												Dungeons of dredmor is a Rouge-Like. In my opionion it is a good rouge-like too. It is a simplified and more streamlined rougelike then most, making it easier for new players to get into. Happily this does not mean that Dod is easy, far from it. Even on the easy difficulty this game is unforgiving. New players can opt out of perma death to make it abit easyer on them. I recommend this game to anyone who is intrested in trying a rougelike, but was intimidated by the unfriendly interface in games like NetHack.			",302,56,2,54,18,3,48

												This game doesn't take itself too seriously and is good for a few hours exploration, fun and adventure. The downside was writing codes to enter secret dungeons. When I saw magical graffiti, I knew that soon I would be fumbling around the cushions looking for my pen. Then later I would forget to cross off codes and wonder if I had already explored them. Also inventory management was tedious and resulted in giant piles of stuff left in a depot. Certain skills allow items to really pile up and even after a while of playing I wasn't sure what to keep, sell, or turn into fish.			",156,57,0,25,18,1,40

												If you have a thing for classic dungeon crawlers, and consider yourself a fan of the Rogue-likes genre, then DoD is worth the money hands down. It makes up for what it lacks in graphics with an abundance of classes, skills, items, and genuinely clever content written about all the above. The ability to play with perma-death keeps me going, and for those that would rather a more casual game, you can simply turn it off.  Throw in randomly generated dungeons, and now you have a great game worth holding onto.The first few plays through you may well end up dying horribly from the unsuspecting trap or challenging enemy, but once you get a feel for which classes work well together it really just comes down to patience, skill and a just the right amount of luck as any good rogue-like does. If you're having trouble progressing far in the dungeon, its probably due to a bad build or unwillingness to try something new. Overall its a great RPG with a unique class system, interesting crafting, tons of DLC and player made content, and a good sense of humor.			",43,15,0,8,2,0,1

												A fantastic entry level roguelike - if you've ever been interested in the genre, but games like Stone Soup are too intimidating then this is for you.The humor may be quite hit or miss - but anyone who has played a lot of tabletop or board games may get a few chuckles here and there. As will those of us who are members of the Big Eyebrow Master Race.Full disclosure though - like many roguelikes there is a LOT of luck involved, and the starting skills aren't particularly balanced... as a result it's more of a casual roguelike, so all 2 of you hardcore rogulike fans can probably pass on this one - for everyone else however, it's a great way to try out the genre.

												DoD is stupidly addictive and clearly made by people who love the roguelike-turnbased-dungeoncrawler genre. Many of the enemies, items, and skills are genuinely weird, but if you read the descriptions they're often funny and clever too.Much of the replayability comes from the 35 different skillsets (51 with all DLC) of which you pick 7 each game. These range from your standard Sword & Archery specialties, to Piracy & Archaeology, to originals like ""Fleshsmithing"" and ""Mathemagic"". I'd recommend starting with standard weapon & shield skills along with Promethian Magic and Psionics. Leave the Necronomiconomics and Killer Vegan skills for a later challenge :)Oh and there's optional crafting (weapons, traps, potions, magic wands, etc) with pretty big loot tables too.My only criticisms: the randomized sidequests are somewhat indecipherable and lame (but hey, treasure), and there's no way the game could be played well with a gamepad due to inventory and hotkey management.If you're still not sold, hey, the game has at least 9 types of cheese and 13 kinds of fungus for your character to eat.

												Have you always wanted to try a roguelike but were scared off by the inhuman difficulty and permadeath? Then this is the game for you! It's roguelike made easier (it even has optional permadeath) and more user friendly (now with graphics!). Also, it's funny as hell and unbelievably cheap. Seriously, forget all these Skyrims and play this instead.			",47,6,1,5,0,0,9

												Ye gods! What do the lutefisk gods want? Ten slabs of lutefisk burned upon their altars and nothing!Seventh character and third floor down into the dungeons, I was armed with the Murderous Shiv of Crowbars, and Interdimensional Axe, and a Crossbow Bolt of Mass Destruction. I was feeling good. So good, in fact, that I tried stealing the world's most amazing three-bladed sword from Brax, the salesdemon. Then I proceeded to flay his cheap suited form with it. Ecstatic, I frolicked through the loot - Bolts of Squids, a Cyber Construction Cone helmet, and a Steam Powered Mechanical Arm of Crushing that belonged to some guy whose name I couldn't pronounce.Then the Dread Collectors came.Pink, blubberous monsters with pot-bellies and devious Spanish goatees. I unleashed my Bolt of Mass Destruction from Cranky (TM), by automatic crossbow. It bounced off... The walls of the dungeon were rent apart by the force of the nuclear blast, and a handful of the Collectors lost a tenth of their health. I scurried down an aisle of shelves to form a choke point, and smeared poison on my new weapons. I chucked Flasks of Brimstone and Softballs. I turned on my Swashbuckling Auto-Counter ability. I ingested at least six different mushrooms, endowing me with lobstery skin, flannel, a beard, and the might of Chuck Norris. Then the first Collector reached me. I counter attacked him into a fine pink mist.With chants of ""Slay the eyebrowed one!"", the second Collector counter-criticalled me into next Tuesday with a vengeance as I tried to escape into my pocket dimension. I slumped down, blood pouring out onto the floor.BUY THIS GAME, BUT DO NOT, FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THE WONDERFUL LOOT IN THE DUNGEON, DO. NOT. EVER. SHOPLIFT.			",100,11,1,10,2,0,11

												This is an excellent RPG game if your in for turn based games. even for players who are not particularly into turn based RPG can derive many hours of fun from this humor filled, challenging RPG. even though it may seem like a short game from the review it can actually take a decent amount of time just to get a few floors in not to mention permadeath makes it so that when you die (which will happen alot) you have start from square 1. all in all a humourus game with just about infinite ways to die (especially if you add mods).

												Thus far, Dungeons Of Dredmor feels like the most true-to-form Roguelike of recent years. Of course there are other games that feel more like the original genre--ASCII Graphics, mouse-less controls, ten thousand keyboard shortcuts--but that's not what makes a Roguelike good. The complexity of the genre is still there in Dredmor, but it's more accessable. All in all, if you need an introduction to the Roguelike genre, or simply want something you can take a bit less seriously but still enjoy as much as the Hack's and Dungeon Crawl's that are the current staple of the genre, Dungeons Of Dredmor is a good choice. Also, it's entirely worth the $5 pricetag. Don't bother waiting for a sale, if you think you'd enjoy the game.			",68,6,4,23,19,0,21

												This is hands-down my favorite rogue-like (an actual rogue-like) that I've ever played. The base game itself contains so many ridiculous skill trees and items that its hard not to derive even a little fun from it even for those not into turn based RPG's. On top of that the DLC's add even more content that adds to the absurdity and wonder of this game and one of them is free. Also, this game is cheap as hell. It is easily worth triple what they are charging for it and I honestly feel kinda bad that I can't hand them more money. In addition, just in case you manage to somehow-inconceivabley-run out of things to do in the base game and DLC, the mod support for this game is fantastic, with hundreds of new skills, items, and enemies to be easily downloaded from the workshop. This game easily falls onto my list of must own games on Steam and for this price ($5) there is no reason not to own this game.			",171,38,2,33,13,1,21

												Dungeons of Dredmor is a great roguelike game in the spirit of the original games. Turn based, dungeon crawl with challenges of inventory management (though a bit easier now).The challenge starts at the very beginning with the selection of a skill set that has the proper synergy (ghads, I actually wrote that? No, I'm not a middle manager, why do you ask) - though do give random a try (there's a badge for it). Tossed into this mix is crafting (and encrusting), spell and ammunition management, and choices about which skills to level up when.The theme game is to be taken light heartedly, but the challenge of the game is right up there with Nethack and its brethren (and yet, it is still much more approachable than the roguelikes of old). You will find new and interesting ways to die (there's a badge for that too). The game is a worth it at twice its standard price			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My initial look at the video and screenshots did not give me high expectations for this game.  Fortunately, I still decided to try it out, and I am very glad I did.  This is an excellent and charming rogue-like, very true to the spirit of the original rogue, or later, nethack.  The graphics and sound effects are not mindblowing, but they work very well.If I were to criticize at all, it would be just to wish for some more UI options, such as moving/adjusting the log scroller, and perhaps adding more detail to it, as well as some way to look at tiles that are behind walls.  But these are minor annoyances, and don't really detract from the fun I've had playing so far.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys rogue-likes in a heartbeat!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First roguelite game I bought on a recommendation from a friend. I've been playing this on and off for quite a while now, and have enjoyed every death immensely. Still haven't tried out most of the different skill trees, mostly because I tend to die quite often.The devs really do help out with some of the problems the negative reviews mention, like bugs and crashes, and the mod content can really flesh out any aspect of the game.A really great game you can waste time on anytime and anywhere.

												Exploring the dungeon casually with my moustache-golem until found a pocket dimension device.Inside the dimension was a portal device, where one could input custom text.I wrote Dredmor, and a red, hellish portal activated. It didn't look safe at all, so I went in.Ended up in Diggle hell and got surrounded by smaller Diggles in all the colours of the rainbow.There was also one bodybuilder Diggle.

												DoD is stupidly addictive and clearly made by people who love the roguelike-turnbased-dungeoncrawler genre. Many of the enemies, items, and skills are genuinely weird, but if you read the descriptions they're often funny and clever too.Much of the replayability comes from the 35 different skillsets (51 with all DLC) of which you pick 7 each game. These range from your standard Sword & Archery specialties, to Piracy & Archaeology, to originals like ""Fleshsmithing"" and ""Mathemagic"". I'd recommend starting with standard weapon & shield skills along with Promethian Magic and Psionics. Leave the Necronomiconomics and Killer Vegan skills for a later challenge :)Oh and there's optional crafting (weapons, traps, potions, magic wands, etc) with pretty big loot tables too.My only criticisms: the randomized sidequests are somewhat indecipherable and lame (but hey, treasure), and there's no way the game could be played well with a gamepad due to inventory and hotkey management.If you're still not sold, hey, the game has at least 9 types of cheese and 13 kinds of fungus for your character to eat.

Be a melee tank, dodge focused rogue, wizardly spellcaster, engineering tinkerer building bombs and weird weapons, or be a Vampire Communist Sword dual weilding tourist who uses blood magic.

Pero lo que brilla por encima de todo es su sentido del humor: desde los menús a los enemigos, pasando por las descripciones de los objetos, es un juego que no se toma en serio ni al propio género ni a si mismo.

												This game is a real treat.  It's not only a well drawn dungeon crawl done in the old school style of Rogue and Nethack, but it's bursting at the seams with geek humor and benefits from modern advances in design and game philosophy without sacrificing any of the rushlessness and lack of mercy that is the hardcore pedigree of this genre.  Standard skill packages like Swords, Dual Wielding, and Alchemy find use alongside more unconventional schools like Veganism, Emomancy, and Viking Magic.  As a difficult yet slickly humorous adventure, this is a definate fit for anyone with a penchant for heroic vandilism looking for some randomly generated fun.			",388,68,6,39,31,2,41

												(At launch:) It reminds me of the Magicka launch in that the game itself is brilliant and chock full of witty references and homages of all kinds + fun to play... and yet it randomly CTD's, has usability issues and other flaws that need to be patched ASAP. It's a true roguelike though, so just forget about the Magicka comparison. A mouse-driven RL is a nice idea but it needs to be polished. When the game's working correctly it's a real treat for all who like to dabble with permadeath and turn-based action RPGs. Dwarf Fortress, Nethack, oldschool PC gaming and silly geek humour represent.			",554,177,10,94,66,6,114

												Simple to get into, yet surprisingly deep, Dredmor is a good test to see if you like Roguelike games.  It lacks the complexity of a true Roguelike - though this isn't necessarily a bad thing!

It's a high-quality example of the genre and combines humor, dungeon grinding, and RPG elements in a fun package. For the low price, I'd recommend picking it up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While it does suffer some minor issues, and some major ones (perhaps I have been spoilt by dungeon crawl, but that's a free game and lets you go places by clicking on the minimap, rest until healed and autoexplore, all of which Dungeons of Dredmor could do with) it's overall a decent rougelike with humour, customisable skillsets and with the level of graphics and animations rougelikes mostly lack. If you aren't familiar with rougelikes, this one is more appoachable than most, but maybe try some of the more accessible free ones first to see if you like the genre.			",285,84,5,32,32,5,84

												A fantastic entry level roguelike - if you've ever been interested in the genre, but games like Stone Soup are too intimidating then this is for you.The humor may be quite hit or miss - but anyone who has played a lot of tabletop or board games may get a few chuckles here and there. As will those of us who are members of the Big Eyebrow Master Race.Full disclosure though - like many roguelikes there is a LOT of luck involved, and the starting skills aren't particularly balanced... as a result it's more of a casual roguelike, so all 2 of you hardcore rogulike fans can probably pass on this one - for everyone else however, it's a great way to try out the genre.

												Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup lite edition.Its pretty good, and the permadeath harder modes make it a lot more challenging to beat the entire game. A lot of the stuff in the game is plain ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ though, as if they put no thought into the quality of the artwork or the art style at all. The limited monster variety is pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥too, you end up fighting recolored generic grunts a lot.Even the harder modes are pretty easy, most character builds will plough through generic enemies and the only times I have died is when i have encountered a monster zoo (its a room packed with hundreds of similar grunts) as i was surrounded and unable to move my dudesman.The devs were good enough to include a development kit so there are a large amount of mods to fix the multitude of problems with the game and to add additional modes which is really good.The mods really add many more hours to the game, but the game as is, is averaging a 7/10			",192,36,1,15,8,1,26

												I'll start off by saying Dungeons of Dredmor is not for everyone.  DoD is a Rogue-like; meaning that it is modeled after the classic game, Rogue.  This means that death is permanent and you must re-roll a new character after each loss.  This would be a slog if not for the fact that you are able to pick from a huge amount of skills to bring with you each time.  This makes each playthrough a new experience as you combine different skills to see what works for you.  The difficulty is countered by a lighthearted and downright silly tine that will surprise and delight.I really do encourage you to try this game.  It is super cheap and Steam seems to put it on sale fairly frequently.  Plus, one of the DLCs is actually free.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Also, the developers are charging you basically nothing for this game, and for any DLC. The only negative is inventory management, but it certainly makes up for it in other categories.

												tl;dr  good game with minor flawsFantastic game! Picked up recently during the humble bundle and (like many games) I didn't think I'd get around to playing it. I love games with RPG elements but i'm not a huge fan of turn based games. I was pleasently surprised with Dungeons of Dredmor. It has a simple, but appealing, art style (reminiscent of a flash game). The gameplay is fun and easy to pick up, plenty of pop culture refrences and throwbacks to games. Before I wrote a review I wanted to put a couple more hours in and i'm glad I did. My few gripes with the game:-The control customization is lacking some but easily remedied with a simple AHK script-The fast travel system is a little annoying, would have prefered an in-game memory system-The crafting/profession system (although helpful) just remained unused in most my playthroughs and it didn't make a difference			",146,23,2,8,12,1,17

												This game will have you hooked for hours, and that's honestly no lie. The game doesn't take itself seriously, and it knows that, and plays off that the entire time which definitely makes for an enjoyable experience; the humor doesn't get old as it has so many jokes and references. The gameplay itself might not be what you expect from a Roguelike-- it's not as complicated. However that doesn't make a bad rogue-like by any means, as the core mechanics are certainly there: you're gonna die and die and DIE until the game feels bored with you... and then will kill you at the final boss anyways, because well hey, it's a Roguelike and that's just what they do. You'll be playing this game for hours, trying to figure out what is the best combination of skills for your liking, how the enemies work, and what items do what and how they even do that. It's jolly good fun, the expansion is entirely worth it... and this, on complete, is less than eight dollars. It's literally a steal.			",75,3,0,13,7,0,14

Easily amused by nerdy jokes in flavour text and tool tips or by pop culture references in the names of achievements? Want to pretend you're a game developer and name an expansion pack? Then Dungeons of Dredmor is the Roguelike for you!It's also a pretty good little time-wasting game in and of its own right, even if the things above don't apply. Even if you don't get the expansion packs, the base game will occupy plenty of your time, so long as you have a hankering for wandering dungeons, picking up loot and learning what potions do by the time honoured method of drinking them and hoping it wasn't horrible poison. DoD is a Roguelike, obviously, so anyone with a low tolerance for RNG-related failure or starting over for the 8th time this morning should either avoid it or only play on Elves Just Wanna Have Fun Difficulty with permadeath off. The pointy-eared wimps. Dredmor lacks a traditional Class system - your character has a set of Skill trees which you pick out of a pretty long list from the obvious (Shieldmaster) to the slightly more bizarre (Tourist). These make for some weird and wonderful synergies as you combine your Vampiric powers of sparkling with Necroeconomics. A large part of the fun comes from exploring these skill trees - what exactly does a Magical Lawyer Clockwork Knight with Burglary and Viking Wizardry end up like?Like any Rogeulike, DoD can suffer from repetitive grind, but there's enough different skills to mess around with that it stands up to some pretty heavy play without becoming wearing too quickly. And any game can get dull if you spend too much time with it. There are a few issues, like the way that magic/missile builds can be the only way to win (assuming you ever actually GET to Lord Dredmor himself) and the crafting system is... well, functional. When you get to higher crafting levels, the lack of filters or a basic search option in the crafting menu is a little irksome. And, of course, the RNG plays a big factor in what ingredients and which blueprints you get to play around with. But these are minor flaws that don't detract from  Dredmor's overall experience. And since it has Steam Workshop, you can get around some of these with mods.Fun, funny Rogue-like and arguably the one responsible for the recent run of Roguelikes with graphics or Roguelike-lites as some folks refer to them. Also, pretty darn cheap and comes with Trading Cards for those of us who like that kind of thing.			",162,27,0,37,20,1,54

												This is a roguelike game designed as a send-up of the genre.  The jokes are hilarious, particularly if you've put as much time as I have into classic roguelikes such as Nethack or Angband, and the gameplay is quite good on its own.  As far as I've seen, it doesn't really have the puzzle-solving aspect of those games, it's purely tactical hacking.  The skill trees are amusing (of course) and fun to play around with.  One drawback to Dredmor is that a lot of the controls are mouse based and every action is animated, making gameplay much slower than in the roguelikes I've played before.  This can be worked around with game options, and I would recommend playing with the speed turned up (use ""+"" key) and autopickup enabled.If I have a few minutes to kill and am not in the mood for twitch zombie shooting, this will be at the top of my list.

												Hilarious amounts of  references, One of the ultimate items is ""The mace of windu"" its icon is a light saber. You get several traits to pick from when starting a character, such as emomancy, Necronomiconomics, Magical law, were diggle..... each with its own tech tree. starting is a bit brutal and you will probably die copious amounts but its incredibly fun! It took me almost a week just to each level 5 at wich i promtly entered a wrong portal and had a giant muscular Diggle diablo kill me whoops! The crafting in this game is amazingly complex. I highly suggest getting the community mod that  puts all the crafting skills into one tree. THe community mods alone make for almost infinte replayabilty. this game will suck you in if your an old school gamer if your looking for gorgeous graphics you'll be disappointed however if you enjoy grammatical jabs at gaming, societey, and life in general this game will have you HOWLING with fits of laughter. Even the monsters witty taunts will have you giggling.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Yesterday I picked up a copy of Dungeons of Dredmor by Gaslamp Games on Steam for a deliriously low price. I had previously seen the game-play trailer on the Steam store page but wasn't sure about picking up the title until I saw this video from The Cynical Brit. Who, by the way, is awesome, and not just because his English accent makes everything just slightly funnier.Dungeons of Dredmor is basically an old-school roguelike game, similar to Angband. It's got all of the typical roguelike features: it's really hard, you die a lot, there's random junk everywhere, there's tons of monsters, you die a lot, etc etc. What it adds to the genre is, wait for it... graphics! Don't get me wrong, roguelikes are great, I've had a lot of fun with Angband, but monochrome text characters gets a little tiring. Also, I have a mouse; it is not a new invention; it is wonderful for controlling things. Dredmor is capable of understanding the mystical signals that emanate from mice, it's amazing!What's especially great about the game is that it really doesn't take itself very seriously. Everything is silly and strange and ridiculous. For example, my character specializes in growing mushrooms. No, seriously, I grow mushrooms on the corpses of my slain enemies. And then I eat them (the mushrooms). You can get suits of armor made out of bright pink plastic. There's references to all sorts of pop-culture and even terribly obscure geek culture. Just before going to bed last night I found a ""Horadric Lutefisk Cube"". If you don't get the reference, then you are a poor and sad creature and I pity you.Of course if you don't like roguelikes, you probably won't like this game very much. It's about as old-school as you can get and still be a new game though. Luckily, they've also implemented 3 difficulty settings, and the ability to disable permadeath, for, you know, giant♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Which does make the game a lot more approachable.But where else can you throw baseballs at demons that do lightning damage?

Swords, bows, shields, spells, wands, bombs, food, drink, mushrooms, potions, raw elements, character leveling, skill trees, inventory system, hot keys--everything that makes an RPG good.Seriously, it feels like they took all the good things from the Ultima series, Wizardry series, and Atari's Gauntlet, threw out all the bad things, and kept the game and interface as simple as possible. This is an instant classic.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												If you have a thing for classic dungeon crawlers, and consider yourself a fan of the Rogue-likes genre, then DoD is worth the money hands down. It makes up for what it lacks in graphics with an abundance of classes, skills, items, and genuinely clever content written about all the above. The ability to play with perma-death keeps me going, and for those that would rather a more casual game, you can simply turn it off.  Throw in randomly generated dungeons, and now you have a great game worth holding onto.The first few plays through you may well end up dying horribly from the unsuspecting trap or challenging enemy, but once you get a feel for which classes work well together it really just comes down to patience, skill and a just the right amount of luck as any good rogue-like does. If you're having trouble progressing far in the dungeon, its probably due to a bad build or unwillingness to try something new. Overall its a great RPG with a unique class system, interesting crafting, tons of DLC and player made content, and a good sense of humor.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I will never beat Dungeons of Dredmor.Yep, I said it, never. I have countless hours logged, and I haven't seen a good 70% of this game. But I love it.With the recent rush of Rogue-likes and Roguelikes, and RogueLITES, and Rogue-like-likes, this is a down to earth Roguelike. This is your Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, your Nethack, your TOME, but more accessible.For starters, there is music, and art, and a good interface. Then throw in all those potions, and spells and weapons and armor that have all those stats and may or may not screw you over, a crafting system, incredibly humorous flavor text, and a huge modding scene and you have a game that costs next to nothing ($7 for everything (not including the FREE DLC)) that will last you a life time.I might not be able to beat it, but maybe you can.

												As roguelikes go, this one's definitely very approachable. It's got a great sense of humor, and a nice amount of depth to it that doesn't overwhelm you. When I'm in the mood for something that doesn't require twitch reflexes and allows me to plan things out at a casual pace, I load this up. There IS a slight learning curve to it though, so the first death or two (because yes, you will frequently die since this IS a roguelike) will leave you scratching your head... and while the tutorial will give you an idea on how the controls work it doesn't really give you any ideas on exactly HOW you should be playing.If you're even vaguely curious about the roguelike RPG genre, give this one a try.

												I watched the trailer and I was like, ""Meh."" I played the tutorial and I was like, ""Meh."" Then I tried actually playing through some games, and it turns out this game is surprisingly addictive.In particular, the skill trees are actually a lot of fun. You pick a set of skills when you start out, and you get to gradually advance them, which is very satisfying. And depending on the skills you choose, the game plays significantly differently, which is some serious replay value. Seriously. So much replay value. It's insane.There's a lot of visceral pleasure in exploring the dungeons, uncovering new rooms, beating the monsters senseless, and stealing all the treasure. It's much more fun than I thought it would be.			",389,99,10,43,22,3,85

												Now, for those that grew up on rogue games, this one is much more timid. However, it has graphics :).  The sense of humor makes me chuckle, and the game play, other than crafting, is very tight.I really like all the many combinations of unique builds you can make based around a list of characteristics rather than just one class.  It keeps the game interesting even after a few deaths. And you will die.  Permadeath is really the only way to play this, as it adds that extra tension that makes the thing so exciting in the first play.  Not much for story, but as a turned based dungeon craller, you won't find much better than Dredmor.			",164,33,4,9,11,1,21

However if you already know what the word 'roguelike' meant before reading this, just go get it.

												This is a surprisiingly good game.  It takes me back to all the Roguelikes I used to play.  The music is a little repetitive but it's not annoying, and the hand-drawn art is charming.  Worth a look if you are nostalgic over Rogue-likes.			",206,45,2,61,21,0,81

												One if not THE best roguelike currently availiable. Reminiscent of the old MUDs almost in a way. The humor is self-depracitating and hilarious at times. But also you can wrack up the difficulty quite a bit to make it a surefire challenge. So it is both a casual and a hardcore game. One that suits the aspect of both quite well.

												A mouse-driven GUI and pleasing aesthetics make this game a roguelike for the masses. Dungeons of Dredmor provides opportunities to die in a myriad of interesting ways - not all of them at the hands of monsters.

												I own a lot of games, but this is the one that I keep coming back to most often. The game is clever and funny, riffing on practically every major fantasy or sci-fi movie book or game of the past century (Dwarf Fortress, Doom, Quake, Half-Life, Elder Scrolls, Conan the Barbarian, the Cthulhu Mythos, Planet of the Apes, Harry Potter, The Wicker Man, Star Trek, Dungeons & Dragons, Diablo, Pac-Man, Warhammer, Super Mario, The Thing, The Blob, Master of Magic, the list goes on and on; There's a seventeen page long list on the developer's forum and it's still imcomplete), yet it also has more than enough depth to still remain interesting long after you've seen all of the jokes. (And if you -do- get bored with what is included in the game, one of the official expansions is free and several of the fan-made mods {specifically FAXPAX, Interior Dredmorating, Compleat Essential Skills, Roguish Renovation, ASCII Invasion, and Swashbuckling} are of a quality comparable to the core game).One word of warning however: The game does not interact correctly with the steam's SteamCloud remote savegame system and the developers have so far been unable to figure out why, so it is recommended that you turn SteamCloud off for this game if you don't want your save files randomly erased. Erasure of save files may also occur if the game crashes while autosaving.			",303,113,2,80,50,5,71

												I purchased this game along with a handful of other rogue-like games during a bundle and I was not expecting much. This game not only blew my expectations out of the water but it took the whole ocean with it! The game has a massive class system where you can mix and match more then a dozen classes together to create something truly fun and fullfilling. Want to make a dual wielding axe berserker who only eats his veggies and has a soft spot for animals? Done! Want to make a Vampire mage who sold his soul to the undead to attain Necro magic? Done! I could go on theres so much replay value this game has its insane. Theres also a crafting system aswell as you go deeper into the dungeon you pick up reagents used to make armor,weapons,potions,bombs,traps, the list goes on! I could type out a wall of text on how great this game but you have to experience it for yourself. Bottom line for 5 bucks this game is worth it and I would have gladly pay more b/c the developers deserve it!			",38,4,1,13,2,2,23

												Dungeons of Dredmor is the first ""indie"" game that I remember completely and utterly loving.  For the first month that I owned it, I spent pretty much every night until 3-4AM slowly progressing through the eponymous dungeons, listening to Rush's Caress of Steel on loop (great combination, by the way).  Dredmor displays an impressive and very intelligent combination of depth and accessibility, offering a fun early game to hook you in, followed by challenging middle- and end-games to keep you coming back for just one more try.  Additionally, the game costs $5 at full price, which seems almost ridiculous when compared to the trend of steadily increasing prices for indie games of generally lower quality.  If I have one complaint about the game, it is probably that (to me, at least) weapon-based character builds seem to be much harder to use than magic based builds (especially those involving Promethean magic), though this is likely due to ignorance on my part, as I'm sure there are people out there who dominate with fighter/rogue/shooty-man builds.  However, none of this is to say that I do not have fun seeing how far I can get as a fighter-type, because I do.  9.5/10			",159,18,3,27,8,1,27

												The first time I played this game I absolutely hated it. The visuals are so frustrating to navigate and having items and monsters hidden behind the scenery is possibly the worst idea for a genre where every step is critical.BUT, there is a lot of good in here. Skills are fun and varied; the monsters are interesting and the entire world seems like it was made by someone with a concussion. (That's a good thing)I would have preferred a top down view more like doom rl but despite its visual problems, once I sat down for a few hours with it; I didn't realise how much I was enjoying myself.

												dungeons of dredmor is good fun. the dungeon itself feels vast with many different levels and secrets. Loot is free flowing as it is in any rogue type game and the monsters each have their own unique sense of flair. wit over 40 starting skills to choose from you can completely specialize your character any way you want, be it as a pure fighter who walks into room and is the only one who leaves, or a rogue who kills enemys before they even know he was there or even a magical swordman if thats your thing. the game can be hardstarting off at first but permadeath can be turned off allowing you to adjust to your character. Overall very fun game would highly recommend to anyone who is a fan of the rogue or rgp genre			",81,15,1,18,4,2,3

												Surprisingly clever and fun game.  Highly recommended.  Excellent intro to roguelikes and simply one of the better ones simply for its *excellent* setting and tone and very clever mechanics.Doesn't try to over balance (i.e. make eveyrthing so readily comparable that they aren't really differentiated) which allows the game to be fun [less so than more complex roguelikes; but tearing a rift in spacetime to destroy a room is still fun].Also: the game looks way better when playing than it does in stills!  (Seriously, I almost didn't get it because it looked so ugly in screenshots; but I actually really enjoy the graphics when playing the game.)Great game to at least try.  Can't wait to see Gaslamps next game (Clockwork Empires).			",68,20,0,25,5,1,30

												This game is great. For those of you that love the hack and slash, mob slaughtering, loot grabbing, pun filled dungeon crawl with tons of class customization and tweaking, this game is for you. Don't let the low amount of time Steam says I've spent on this game fool you. I spent quite a bit on it at a friends house trying it out. This game is quick to suck you in, although it's easy enough to save your progress if need be and pick it back up later. There is a bit of a learning curve when it comes to figuring out which combinations of character skills you need to actualy survive based on your play style, but with three different modes to play on, one of which being a permadeath mode, you can learn as you go. A couple of other great things I like about this game, is you can actually choose to be a female adventurer, which to me is great, as most dungeon crawlers try to put the female character as a spell slinger or an archer. I'm a girl, I prefer to be hacking off limbs in the front lines. This game lets me do just that. Replay values in this game are insane as well, since you never know what your dungeon is going to look like. Each one is randomly generated, with mobs, side quests, loot... This is just amazing to me. Heck, you can even get mods and install mods and extra content for this game that other people have created. Controls are fairly simple, and you can adjust your keybindings if need be as with most games of this genre. All in all, this game is well worth the cost, and getting it on sale is definitely a must. I recommend this game to anyone with a few bucks to spend on a game. You won't be disappointed.			",50,20,0,17,20,1,13

 Great, fun, and funny. A Baby's first Roguelike One of the easier classic Roguelikes.The game itself is like an introduction to traditional/classic Roguelikes.Notable Features/Pros are:   Turn-based combat and gameplay akin to traditional roguelike mechanics  A humorous, albeit too much, approach to conquering a dungeon.  A good number of specs/classes to combine and choose from.  Near infinite replayablity due to modding.  A light enchantment system and a large number of weapons and armor to go along with it.  RNG is very fair compared to RLs such as Angband/Nethack Rating 7/10   A roguelike that is definitely on the easier side of the RL Difficulty spectrum. Definitely recommended as it is fun, quirky and fairly cheap and for those looking for a starting place on Roguelikes. Also a great addition to your steam RL collection. ",84,21,1,43,3,0,5

												The funny thing about this game is this:The major cons that I would cite are not the fault of the developers. It's things along the lines of the fact that there is no readily accessible wiki that is up to date. It takes some major diggling around to find the one that actually includes proper enemy stats or all of the encrusting recipes. And yes, I understand that a lot of people want to discover things for themselves, but you'll be kicking yourself the first time you discover that yes, you DID need to keep all of those steaks for Gaga's Glaze, or that bronze is very useful for the Offensive Shielding encrust.The other thing that I would note is that you can hit endgame gear  pretty quickly (about dungeon level 5-7 out of 15), so there can be a very odd difficulty curve where you no longer have any significant changes to your stats, but things will get pretty tough. If I were to change anything, it would be to make that curve a bit more linear.Otherwise this game is fantastic. For a price tag of $5, I have played this far more than many other titles in the genre.			",116,56,1,43,47,1,33

												For the low low price of 5 dollars, this game is difficult (as a roguelike should be), but is packed with hilarious enemies, amusing item descriptions, and exudes a sense of self-parody that is well integrated without becoming grating. There are too many instances that I have laughed out loud while playing, but the funniest is probably the screen in which you die. ""CONGRATULATIONS! YOU DIED!"" it says triumphantly. This game is well worth the 5 dollars you shell out for it, and then some. I can't wait to see what the subsequent updates will add to this already excellent gem of a game.			",64,8,0,21,9,0,29

												Fantastic little game. If you can get passed the non-existant graphics and animations you will discover a suprisingly deep character creation and crafting system. Tons of items and each level is randomly generated. Definitely a steal if found on sale.Recommended for people who are looking for a light-hearted, casual and engrossing RPG experience.

												First roguelite game I bought on a recommendation from a friend. I've been playing this on and off for quite a while now, and have enjoyed every death immensely. Still haven't tried out most of the different skill trees, mostly because I tend to die quite often.The devs really do help out with some of the problems the negative reviews mention, like bugs and crashes, and the mod content can really flesh out any aspect of the game.A really great game you can waste time on anytime and anywhere.

												Yup, I've played this a lot so high marks for re-playability.I like the challenge of the game.  My efforts through most of the time spent plodding through the dungeons are mostly in an attempt to finish the game on the hardest level with a character using random skills.The skills are one of the best parts.  The number of them makes for some great synergisistic strategy development.  The humour is nice too, where else can you play a comunist banker vampire vegan with an ax?One problem is length.  In the full size mode it takes ages to clear each level but in the 'no time to grind' mode there is only a very limited amount of loot which can make some builds tough to play.			",26,1,0,9,0,0,9

												A turn based rogue-like dungeon crawler with great humour and is very unforgiving. This game is best played on the hardest difficulty and permadeath enabled. I would recommend that you buy the expansions to unlock more skills to play around with. This game also has a modding community with the Steam Workshop so you could spend countless hours messing around with different builds. However your goal in this game is to murder Lord Dredmor, who's in either room 10 or 15, depending on your settings. If you're not a fan of grinding I would definitely recommend you enable ""No time to grind"" which makes each floor smaller but you still get the same amount of experience from clearing them. The only weakness for that option is you won't get as much item drops so your equipment could be poor and you won't get as much crafting items for crafting skills.You may reach the stage where nothing can stand in your way but don't let that fool you. Room 15 will kick your♥♥♥♥♥if you aren't prepared.			",155,38,0,14,4,2,19

												This is a roguelike game, but it doesn't have the bizarre interface, hard-to-learn game mechanics, or ascii-graphics normally associated with the genre, making it very accessible and an excellent introduction to roguelikes.  Some of the jokes appear to be aimed at veterans, though.  There are a lot of jokes and a very strange sense of humour.  This doesn't mean it's a silly game - the game itself is not a joke, but a lot of the flavour text is. Instead of choosing a class, you choose 7 skills, ranging from weapon skills, armour skills, numerous magic skills, dodging, veganism, geology, archaeology...  so although there's no ""warrior"" class, you can just make a warrior by choosing all weapon and armor skills.  Or make a mage, or a rogue, or just about anything in between.  Because of the way heavy armor and spellcasting work together (they don't), warrior-wizard hybrids have some problems, but any other hybrid can work well.There are also crafting skills, and a lot of craftable items and discoverable recipies.  Thanks to some very powerful craftables introduced in the expansion packs, crafting is a bit overpowered.Modding support is very good - indeed, the free expansion pack is mostly made up of of the best player-made mods.I have very few complaints.  One is that the final boss is *MUCH* more dangerous than anything that comes before it.  The problem is not the toughness of the boss by itself, it's just that the rest of the game doesn't do a good job of teaching the player how to deal with him.Also, this is an indie game, made with an indie budget.  Occasionally that shows, like with late-game monsters that look like palette-swapped versions of earlier monsters.  It also comes with an indie price tag, and that makes it excellent value for money.			",27,3,0,10,3,1,16

												When I first started playing this game, I felt rather iffy about it, to say the least. Once I actually started to get into the game, I quickly found myself far more entertained than I thought I would be. The gameplay is excellent, making for a roguelike experience that remains relatively simple. The comedy is quite prevalent, and though it is often referential hmor, I manages to be good referential humor (""all craftdwarfship is pretty crummy, actually"", and other things like that)Overall a very enjoyable game, with some slight visual issues in the form of very limited character model customization.

												The combination of simplicity with complexity in this game meld into a strange carnal pleasure. It has your gear finding, monster killing, leveling, but all with a ridiculously outlandish coat of paint over it. Setting it to the highest difficulty with permadeath will not only create frustration and anger, but when you finally beat it a real sense of accomplishment. If only for five minutes before you start up another character.			",377,46,4,52,11,2,18

												The goofy, messy presentation of Dredmor hides a very competent roguelike that will punish you every bit as much as any of the older short(er)form ASCII classics out there. While it tends to wallow in it's own crapulence after a while, the core mechanics are solid and the sheer amount of variety on offer means there's an easy 30 hours of discovery here before you even begin to take the top off the system and really poke around in the guts of it. Definitely recommended to anyone with the deadly, turn-based explorathon bug. Don't let appearances fool you!			",286,36,5,29,20,2,46

												The only turn-based roguelike I will ever need. I could play this game endlessly, and for any amount of time. Sometimes for just a few minutes, wandering into one or two more rooms, sometimes for hours at a stretch. The skills are numerous and varied and the crafting system is excellent. There are a lot of character stats, but you don't need to know all of them to start playing. Most things have tooltips, so you'll learn as you go. Personally, I think the game should be played with permadeath on. That way you can try different builds, searching for the one that will net you the least embarrassing death when you ultimately fail.			",219,83,1,28,23,2,18

												1st delve.-Killed first by a diglet of Diggles (plural(or it should be in my opinion))-Rage Quit for being killed in the first room.2nd delve-Created the ultimate warrior wielding sword, axe and viking magic.-Killed by a Blob who claimed no one loved him, I can't imagine why cause he attack me on sight.-Rage quit because a blob got too excited and hugged me too roughly, snapping my spine.Loved every second of the rage and fell in love with this game.In all seriousness, despite my relatively short play time (Just over an hour). I can definetly see the appeal of this game, although somewhat ""lack luster"" in it's hand drawn art style (which i personally find very endearing but some may not). the game is a turn based, tile by tile ""rogue like"", rpg, dungeon crawler. With a few refrences to boot - I have a trait called ""Witcher"" and i quote ""Going by the name ""White eyebrows"" you travel the world killing monsters for good, and making witty and sarcastic comments about various social endeavors -, the game unlike most rogue liek rpgs does not by any means take itself seriously, humour riddles the sprawling floors of the dungeons, with the various enemies insulting you and making genric comments about various aspects of you, the dungeons facilities (Quote - ""The vodka is good, but the steak is stale"" ).But like most games in the rogue liek genre, it turns into a loot rush as you scurry to gather gear all the while avoiding what would be considered tier 1 mobs and very easy fights due to the sheer squishiness that you character can suffer if the right traits aren't picked.All in all... ""The vodka's good, but the steak is stale"". The game is characterful, but the genres it's in is bloated and stale dragging this gem down with it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A hardcore roguelike in the traditional fashion that somehow manages to be brutally hard and accessible simutaneously. What really sets this game apart is its humor. There are enough hilarious tidbits written in the descriptions of the classes, abilities, and items to keep you entertained for many, many playthroughs. It's a good thing, too, because you will have to do many playthroughs. This game is hard. There is an acheivement for dying to one of the easiest enemies in the game for that very reason. Thankfully, for the weak of heart, there are a number of difficulty settings.I'm now going to list off reasons that everyone should buy this game.- It's vegan friendly- You can be a boy OR a girl- You can spread your communist agenda- You can live out your Twilight vampire romance fantasies- You can pass your Math exams- You can relive the glory days when My Chemical Romance were still togetherIf you aren't convinced to buy this yet, you might as well sacrifice your mushy, lutefisk-looking brains to the Lutefisk God.

												On a personal level, Dredmor hit a sweet spot of nostalgia, complexity, and charm that really resonated with me. The game's lighthearted nature helps keep it casual, but the depth of options and decisions to be made make it challenging and rewarding. It's a classic-style roguelike: tile+turn based, combat heavy, randomly generated dungeons, and a good variety of weapons, armor, and skills to equip yourself with.From the art-style to the item descriptions, to the tool tips for environmental curiosities, I was consistently (and pleasantly) surprised by the attention to detail. Even the modding community does an excellent job of keeping with the spirit of the game's charm, and many of the mods out there are so seamlessly integrated artistically that it feels like the game could have shipped with them. When I picked this title up on a steam sale years ago, I was not expecting to get so much value for such a small investment.			",92,14,1,25,5,0,14

												Highly addictive... fun as well, but this game can eat up hours just because you want to progress further each time you die. A rogue-like-light in all respects, but that does not mean it is a bad game. It can get repetitive, but limit your playing sessions to one or two hours and that won't be a problem. The difficulty is quite extreme, but that's not really a negative point in these kinds of games, it seldom feels too unfair or random, most problems can be remedied with good strategy. A good game, though not the greatest rogue-like out there (that would be Adom).			",31,1,0,2,3,1,11

												Dungeons of dredmor allows you to make a version of iron man.As in, Mr tony stark..If you get pretty damn good.-Unarmed-Tinkering-Blacksmith-Clockwork Knight-Perception(Optional, But useful)-Master of Arms/Shield Skill-Etc.(Note:This setup does require the full DLC set, But its worth a look)Roguelikes are at once brutal, Entertaining, And very often a timesink once you work out the patterns.They are the games where you quite casually toss characters into a meat grinder to see what comes out.Roguelikes are glorious, And this, While easier than the usual genre fare..Is a good option.You begin by selecting a hero/heroine with no random name selector, Forcing some creative juices to flow.The next screen is somewhat more imposing, Especially the first time.Seven skill groups are picked that define what your character can do in the game context, And then you are let loose with a short blurb that basically says the hero meant to head down was on his lunchbreak, So you go down instead.The above build i mentioned is based around a style of play, Namely that of the sturdy and/or drunken warrior.It is very possible to be a sneaky fellow lobbing crossbow bolts, A drunken mad scientist with helper fungus..Or a vegan emo-pirate, Because why not.The drops are random, Creatures silly and endearing, and victory is never a sure thing.If worth nothing else, The game is good for a brief look to dip your toes into the roguelike genre.Skol!

												Dungeons of Dredmor... It's a little hard to explain to people who've never played it. You design a character around specific skills and then explore the randomly generated dungeon in a turn based style. It's not quite long, but it's pretty difficult. It's pretty entertaining, and it's sense of humor is spot on. It shows that it's an indie title with a few polish issues, and unbalanced skill set. The built in tutorial get's the job done, but doesn't quite explain how to set up your characters, or show the finer points of the game. Overall, it comes recommended with a 7/10.

												This is a roguelike for people who normally don't care for them. It's very fair and tactical, so rather than being screwed by the random number generator, deaths are usually well and truly your own damn fault. It also has longevity: the variety of skills and steam workshop integration ensure you'll always have a new way to play the game. Lastly, the writers have a very silly and enjoyable sense of humor, which helps give the game a quirky flavor quite unlike anything else out there.			",410,268,3,151,40,3,79

												Dungeons of Dredmor is something you get when you take an appropriately brutal Rouge-like game and mix it with not only the offbeat comedy of an RPG a la Earthbound but with geeky shout-outs strewn into a pile on the murky floor. It'll take you roughly 20 hours to finish the game since you'll need a LOT of experience in order to take on the final boss whom is mixed amongst his followers on the final floor of the dungeon (so you can either find him right away or be forced to search every room, in either case it doesn't end well). You'll need to grind to survive, especially on later floors. Thankfully there's an option for those who don't live on level grinding like myself so I can recommend this game to just about anyone who likes a good RPG. In other words, expect to die a lot but not enough to make the game unfun.If I were to sum up Dungeons of Dredmor to an emotion, it would be that of finding a Monster Zoo in this game: complete surprise followed by fearing for your life.

												The funny thing about this game is this:The major cons that I would cite are not the fault of the developers. It's things along the lines of the fact that there is no readily accessible wiki that is up to date. It takes some major diggling around to find the one that actually includes proper enemy stats or all of the encrusting recipes. And yes, I understand that a lot of people want to discover things for themselves, but you'll be kicking yourself the first time you discover that yes, you DID need to keep all of those steaks for Gaga's Glaze, or that bronze is very useful for the Offensive Shielding encrust.The other thing that I would note is that you can hit endgame gear  pretty quickly (about dungeon level 5-7 out of 15), so there can be a very odd difficulty curve where you no longer have any significant changes to your stats, but things will get pretty tough. If I were to change anything, it would be to make that curve a bit more linear.Otherwise this game is fantastic. For a price tag of $5, I have played this far more than many other titles in the genre.			",116,56,1,43,47,1,33

												For the low low price of 5 dollars, this game is difficult (as a roguelike should be), but is packed with hilarious enemies, amusing item descriptions, and exudes a sense of self-parody that is well integrated without becoming grating. There are too many instances that I have laughed out loud while playing, but the funniest is probably the screen in which you die. ""CONGRATULATIONS! YOU DIED!"" it says triumphantly. This game is well worth the 5 dollars you shell out for it, and then some. I can't wait to see what the subsequent updates will add to this already excellent gem of a game.			",64,8,0,21,9,0,29

												Dredmore is a fun roguelike with a quirky sense of humor and a solid visual style. There are no classes, just different skill trees that you mix and match, which can lead to some crazy stuff.

												Dungeons of Dredmor was certainly a nice surprise for me. I was expecting an ""easy"" Rougelike with a pretty interface, and while this is true to some extent, this game has got some charm of its own. The difficulty is lowish if you're used to NetHack, Angband and the like, but if you aren't, it can be a devilishly hard game, so expect to die- often. And masochistically ask for more. There are lots of gags and pop culture references thrown around in the game, just check the names of the achievements and the lines creatures utter before attempting to kill you. The game is rough around the edges, and there are a few control issues here and there, but for the most part, nothing that would seriously affect your gameplay. All in all, I recommend it.

Part of the charm of this game is that you have to figure out what combination of abilities/powers work. Then you head out armed with an orange plastic street cone on your head and a cardboard sword. The game mocks you when you die, which can happen pretty frequently. You do have the ability to turn off perma-death if that's your thing. The DLC just makes the game more fun. The mods also add all sorts of fun new things. There is a lot of crafting, if you take the abilities to advance in it, and you can make some pretty zanny stuff, which tends to be more powerful than the standard gear you come across.This is an extremely addicting turn-based game, and I can't recommend it enough.

												Nethack/10.Losing is fun! And you'll be doing a lot of it. This is a pure roguelike, meaning you'll be crawling around dungeons, killing monsters, casting spells, and never being 100% sure if the next door you open will reveal a room full of hundreds of hungry monsters.DoD really does feel like a more graphical Nethack, with its own charm and sense of humor.You absolutely can't go wrong for the price, and it'll run on almost anything. The graphics and audio, while low res (the music sounds very midi), are catchy and memorable.A great game, and highly recommended at almost any price.			",212,37,2,23,26,5,38

												Truly excellent roguelike that embodies the best of inde gaming.  It gives the player a great degree of flexibility as to how they play, with multiple difficulty modes and the ability to turn off perma-death if you so choose.  It plays better with perma-death, but having the option for those who truly hate perma-death is nice.  It has an excellent class/character building system, a great sense of humor, and it is mod friendly meaning there is a lot of content for you.  Buy the complete edition, this game is highly recommended.			",226,40,0,45,17,4,35

												This game is the funniest game I think I've ever played.  It's hard like year-old bread, but I think the (many) deaths you'll meet are fair.  Definitely don't expect your first character to live to the bottom of the dungeon though, it has a somewhat steep learning curve.+ Truly Hilarious+ Challenging+ Customizable -- thousands of skill combinations- Takes a while (5 hours, maybe?) to really get past the learning curve.- For everything being randomly generated, you'll sure see a lot of repetitious graphics.Would value the game at $15 or $10 and DLC at $5 (Realm of the Diggle Gods is best, I think)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dungeons of Dredmor is a truely amazing game. It may not have the high specs like more popular mainstream games do, and it might not have an incredibly developed, emotionally, provocative storyline, like other games, but there's no denying that it has every element nessesary to make it fantastic, fun, and adrinillen pumping Adventure RPG. A perfect mix of catchy music, eye-pleasing graphics (even if they are slightly neanderthal), and corny humor, make this game a MUST BUY in my book.			",30,4,0,6,1,0,2

												I played this game a lot on my old 2008 year old low budget laptop on Linux. I like it when you don't need a beefy computer in order to play some good game.At first I was confused by the interface: lots of different items, not very convenient crafting interface, lots of numbers and secondary stats on character screen scared me. But with little time and patience I figured all that out. So I definitely recommend this game. It has good sense of humor and provides certain challenge. Just try not to get discouraged if you die a few times. :-)The only minor drawback is that it gets repetitive after some time, especially if you chose big rooms and if you are playing with mods, which provide more levels. But I guess you can say that for any game. :-)			",162,53,4,81,52,1,54

												1st delve.-Killed first by a diglet of Diggles (plural(or it should be in my opinion))-Rage Quit for being killed in the first room.2nd delve-Created the ultimate warrior wielding sword, axe and viking magic.-Killed by a Blob who claimed no one loved him, I can't imagine why cause he attack me on sight.-Rage quit because a blob got too excited and hugged me too roughly, snapping my spine.Loved every second of the rage and fell in love with this game.In all seriousness, despite my relatively short play time (Just over an hour). I can definetly see the appeal of this game, although somewhat ""lack luster"" in it's hand drawn art style (which i personally find very endearing but some may not). the game is a turn based, tile by tile ""rogue like"", rpg, dungeon crawler. With a few refrences to boot - I have a trait called ""Witcher"" and i quote ""Going by the name ""White eyebrows"" you travel the world killing monsters for good, and making witty and sarcastic comments about various social endeavors -, the game unlike most rogue liek rpgs does not by any means take itself seriously, humour riddles the sprawling floors of the dungeons, with the various enemies insulting you and making genric comments about various aspects of you, the dungeons facilities (Quote - ""The vodka is good, but the steak is stale"" ).But like most games in the rogue liek genre, it turns into a loot rush as you scurry to gather gear all the while avoiding what would be considered tier 1 mobs and very easy fights due to the sheer squishiness that you character can suffer if the right traits aren't picked.All in all... ""The vodka's good, but the steak is stale"". The game is characterful, but the genres it's in is bloated and stale dragging this gem down with it.			",338,61,2,82,36,2,76

 Great, fun, and funny. A Baby's first Roguelike One of the easier classic Roguelikes.The game itself is like an introduction to traditional/classic Roguelikes.Notable Features/Pros are:   Turn-based combat and gameplay akin to traditional roguelike mechanics  A humorous, albeit too much, approach to conquering a dungeon.  A good number of specs/classes to combine and choose from.  Near infinite replayablity due to modding.  A light enchantment system and a large number of weapons and armor to go along with it.  RNG is very fair compared to RLs such as Angband/Nethack Rating 7/10   A roguelike that is definitely on the easier side of the RL Difficulty spectrum. Definitely recommended as it is fun, quirky and fairly cheap and for those looking for a starting place on Roguelikes. Also a great addition to your steam RL collection. ",84,21,1,43,3,0,5

												A fun roguelike with a tongue-in-cheek kinda humor, nice visuals and a good, if repetitive soundtrack. The combat system is skilltree and cooldown based, which keeps trying out different combinations interesting - although many combinations will prove useless in the endgame, especially when trying to tackle the final boss. But that's kinda the point of trying out different builds - where's the fun in alt-tabbing to a guide every other round? All things considered it is a good way for roguelike beginners to make their baby steps in the genre.  Experienced RL players might get bored after several runs, though.			",47,10,0,11,11,0,2

												Hero's Log, sometime after I painfully learned that demons are just as powerful as it first seems...I obtained a rare artifact today. A strange box that transformed whatever I put inside it into Lutefisk. Fascinating. Sometime later, it occured to me that I might be able to rid myself of this box by turning it into lutefisk with it's own properties.Unfortunately, upon putting the box inside itself, I inadvertantly caused an arcane singularity, and was killed by an all-consuming magical fire.10/10, would serve the Lutefisk God again.

Looting in Dungeons of Dredmor is satisfying to the very last Zorkamid (the currency you accumulation on each runthrough), the RNG is fantastic! If you get a rough start, just start breaking Dredmor statues and smashing Diggle Beaks til your fists start bleeding.			",51,5,0,8,6,0,5

												Rogue-like dungeon crawler with great humour.  The character class system and crafting aspect makes the game very replayable.  This game does suck you in.    The game itself is simple in graphics and gameplay, but it's still a pretty solid game.  It'll take you a while to explore every character class combo, and each one gives you different strengths and angles to go through the game.I loved this game.   it's worth a look.

												A very good rouge-like dungeon crawler game with a very good sence of humor. Very difficult and quite long, but does not make you disinterested. Highly Recommended, especially if you want a game to get you into the rouge-like genre			",99,13,1,18,18,1,21

												A fantastic entry level roguelike - if you've ever been interested in the genre, but games like Stone Soup are too intimidating then this is for you.The humor may be quite hit or miss - but anyone who has played a lot of tabletop or board games may get a few chuckles here and there. As will those of us who are members of the Big Eyebrow Master Race.Full disclosure though - like many roguelikes there is a LOT of luck involved, and the starting skills aren't particularly balanced... as a result it's more of a casual roguelike, so all 2 of you hardcore rogulike fans can probably pass on this one - for everyone else however, it's a great way to try out the genre.

												DoD is stupidly addictive and clearly made by people who love the roguelike-turnbased-dungeoncrawler genre. Many of the enemies, items, and skills are genuinely weird, but if you read the descriptions they're often funny and clever too.Much of the replayability comes from the 35 different skillsets (51 with all DLC) of which you pick 7 each game. These range from your standard Sword & Archery specialties, to Piracy & Archaeology, to originals like ""Fleshsmithing"" and ""Mathemagic"". I'd recommend starting with standard weapon & shield skills along with Promethian Magic and Psionics. Leave the Necronomiconomics and Killer Vegan skills for a later challenge :)Oh and there's optional crafting (weapons, traps, potions, magic wands, etc) with pretty big loot tables too.My only criticisms: the randomized sidequests are somewhat indecipherable and lame (but hey, treasure), and there's no way the game could be played well with a gamepad due to inventory and hotkey management.If you're still not sold, hey, the game has at least 9 types of cheese and 13 kinds of fungus for your character to eat.

												Dungeons of Dredmor, where do I begin? One of the original indie rogue-like darlings in my memory. A truly fantastic rogue-like with a great sense of humor, exploration and music to boot. This game is all about exploring randomly generated dungeons floor by floor until you reach the deepest level and defeat the big bad guy. That being said, it is no small feat doing so and will take quite a long time.The game starts out by allowing you to choose a number of skills trees to associate with your newly created character from Mastery of Fungi to Viking Magic and everything in between. The first skill from each tree is automatically granted to you at the start of the game. Each time you level up you gain one skill point which can be placed in any skill tree you desire. This system of mixing and matching what skill trees are available to your character allows for a great deal of customization and replay value.Each floor in the Dungeon of Dredmor is increasingly difficult and will require you to raise your level as well as seek out better equipment for your character. There are an incredible amount of items, weapons and armors for you to discover and that number is made even larger by secret recipes you discover along the way. Crafting is another large part of the game as many of the items you pick up are only useful for crafting other items. For example you come across many different type of ingots which are used to smelt armor and weapons both mundane and special. Without crafting these items simply take up space in your inventory so it is important to learn the usage of many items in recipes.  There are monster galore in the dungeon and simply clicking on an adjacent creature will attack it. Enemies can dodge, block and even counter your attacks and the same goes for you. It's all in the stats and this game has many, possibly too many? Many more stats than I can go into here, but with such a wealth of useful ones there are plenty of ways to build a functional character.The humor is spot on and I have found myself laughing at a number of things in the game from achievements to items and beyond. Enemies also like to give witty quips as you attack them and subsequently as they die. Musically Dungeons of Dredmor nails the MIDI sound and I can't say that's an easy thing to do. Usually I find MIDI sound to be quite limiting but not in this game. Almost all of the songs are very catchy and fit the mood one way or another. The soundtrack alone is worth checking out.Dungeons of Dredmor gets 9 Lutefisk out of 10			",120,39,0,21,5,0,13

												Addicting! This game is probably one of the funnest, and funniest games I have ever played. You'll get sucked in for hours trying over and over again to get to Lord Dredmor. I spent over 6 hours on the game already and have YET to get past level 3 of the dungeon. It is definitely worth the 5 bucks.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dungeons of Dredmor is by far my favorite modern day rogue-like. I've played quite a few that piqued my interest, and many that delivered on the promise of an exciting and truly random experience. However, DoD takes the cake hands down. It is a legacy that others should attempt to live up to in the future no matter how they may fail, and they will.

												From the endless combinations of unique skil trees, to the bizarre and often downright hilarious randomly generated names, this is everything I want in a Roguelike. The world is srange, the music perfect. The combat is simple to understand, and offers endless possibilities for character builds. I got this game as part of a Humble Bundle, and would gladly have paid full price for it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It also includes an option to turn off permadeath when you become tired of failing and just want a relaxed experience. My only real problem with the game is that the inventory and crafting can be a pain to organize. But then, I'm a packrat so it may be my fault.			",78,32,0,33,8,0,24

												A nice roguelike with fun attributes and skills. Animations make this one play a little slow from time to time (especially with a lot of diggles on the screen one turn can take ages when they start burrowing and unburrowing). Don't underestimate crafting and beware of boss monsters that share their appearances with normal creeps and you should do fine. Lord Dredmor himself is a tough♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ though. Recommend playing on rogue and small floors if you value your time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What a great roguelike! DUNGEONS OD DREDMOR was the first commercial traditional roguelike that got popular, before-hand roguelikes were mostly free and way too complex for a broad audience. Dredmor came and changed that. Don't give me wrong; DoD still is a traditional roguelike but alot of the mechanics were dumbed down so that most of the people would understand them. DoD simplified a lot of stuff but kept the standard mechanics of a turn-based roguelike. This game still has the most important things:<> randomization  <> Perma Death (there also is an option to turn that off, again trying to appeal to a broad audience)<> Crafting<> Skill Trees<> QuestsDoD had all that but as I said simplified! And that's what makes this roguelike so great! It's simple yet so challenging and complex. It always keeps this fine balance between ""dumb-easy"" and ""complex-easy"". But this game is not easy to beat; not at all! DUNGEONS OF DREDMOR is pure roguelike-awesomeness, and it also is the perfect game to start for newcomers to the traditional roguelike genre.

												Yup, I've played this a lot so high marks for re-playability.I like the challenge of the game.  My efforts through most of the time spent plodding through the dungeons are mostly in an attempt to finish the game on the hardest level with a character using random skills.The skills are one of the best parts.  The number of them makes for some great synergisistic strategy development.  The humour is nice too, where else can you play a comunist banker vampire vegan with an ax?One problem is length.  In the full size mode it takes ages to clear each level but in the 'no time to grind' mode there is only a very limited amount of loot which can make some builds tough to play.			",26,1,0,9,0,0,9

												I really like games that have a good mix of lightheartedness and difficulty, and this game brings just that. The randomness aspect of pretty much everything makes every run almost entirely different (unless you decide to use the same skill set every time which I don't recommend unless its the only one you are good at and oyu are going for a win). The ability to make a run short with the 'No Time to Grind' option is really nice, since   you can have quick runs in a game that usually takes a few hours for a near complete run(with DLC). I didn't play very much of the game before I got the DLC, but I can say that the DLC gave it what it might have needed: more stuff. The only problem (and it isn't a real problem) is that in the later floors there are mainly reskinned enemies. Many of them do different things than the original though, and there are still new enemies occasionaly, so this isn't something that takes away interest in the later floors.Essentially, this game has enough variety to allow most players to enjoy it and gives a lot of replay value like good roug-likes should do, but has plenty of comedy and difficulty to make it fun to play each time instead of just being different.

												A fantastic roguelike (yes, an actual turn-based roguelike), with a great sense of humor. In DoD, you'll fight everything from zombies to giant vegetables, while using equipment that references everything from Mario to Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. There's a huge number of different weapons and armor to find, and plenty of different skills to choose between, from vampirism to burglary to becoming a vegan, and a crafting system to let you create and upgrade all kinds of new equipment. Also, you can kill the shopkeeper and take his stuff, so there's that.8/10 Terrified of Monster Zoos			",248,111,6,7,15,5,16

												It's amazing. That's the only way to start. For around seven bucks you get a bunch of dungeon level and a crapload of killing. You kill adorable things, ugly things, and basically moving things. And some things that don't move. And you get to die and re-spec a lot. JUST BUY IT.			",244,57,2,42,29,2,54

												Really fun replayable game.It was really hard my first time, but not knowing what to do was part of the fun.If it's too overwhelming then maybe check out an episode of some experienced player and how they start off the game.My favorite skills are Astrology, Tinkering, Necronomiconomics, Demonology, Killer Vegan.

												This game plays like a 2-D, turn-based Elder Scrolls game (Oblivion/Skyrim) and is worth every penny (it's usually inexpensive to buy anyways)!  I find myself having a lot of fun playing this using the hardcore-type mode where when you die, it's over for good and you have to start a new character.  Lots of fun!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Simple to get into, yet surprisingly deep, Dredmor is a good test to see if you like Roguelike games.  It lacks the complexity of a true Roguelike - though this isn't necessarily a bad thing!  It's great to waste 30min or a few hours on without having to think too hard about your next step.Get it, because Losing Is Fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you understand the following, and you like what you read, then you should get this game: This is a classic dungeon crawling roguelike with a sense of humor.Multiple skills (all humorous and some oddly difficult to figure out), odd enemies, strange weapons, multiple crafting systems (smithing, alchemy, fungimancy?), and many other attributes all make this throwback to the past a worthwhile buy.Overall: 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is hands-down my favorite rogue-like (an actual rogue-like) that I've ever played. The base game itself contains so many ridiculous skill trees and items that its hard not to derive even a little fun from it even for those not into turn based RPG's. On top of that the DLC's add even more content that adds to the absurdity and wonder of this game and one of them is free. Also, this game is cheap as hell. It is easily worth triple what they are charging for it and I honestly feel kinda bad that I can't hand them more money. In addition, just in case you manage to somehow-inconceivabley-run out of things to do in the base game and DLC, the mod support for this game is fantastic, with hundreds of new skills, items, and enemies to be easily downloaded from the workshop. This game easily falls onto my list of must own games on Steam and for this price ($5) there is no reason not to own this game.			",171,38,2,33,13,1,21
