												First of all: Crossworlds = enhanced Armored Princess for PC gamers. The stand-alone Armored Princess is intended for Mac users, since there's no Crossworlds for Mac. Secondly: this is probably the best King's Bounty there is. It has all the good stuff - pleasurable grind, silly-but-fun storyline, plenty of different units and spells etc. without the negatives of the later games (i.e. game-breaking bugs, excessive back-and-forth-running, so-so balance). + nice atmosphere+ constant feeling of progress+ plenty to do (50+ hours per playthrough easily)+ holds its grip until the very end+/- lots and lots of text, but it's skimmable and light-heartedly funnyHighly recommended!

												FIRST: Everyone is correct, purchase 'King's Bounty: Crossworlds"" as it includes the base game and both expansions for $5 more than the standard edition but $5 less than the platinum edition.SECOND: Actually really enjoy this game so far, especially considering I'm just now diving into strategy games. The mechanics take a little bit to figure out but after about an hour you should have a pretty firm grasp of what does what. The graphics are pretty darn good if a little cartoony but that doesn't bother me any. I really like the mix of strategy/fantasy rpg. It's actually a lot of fun, sorta like playing fantasy chess if you will. There doesn't seem to be much of any voice acting, again not a problem for me but just be prepared to do a lot of reading to get the back story and follow what is going on.Would definitely recommend a buy if you like these kind of games. I'm terrible at and have always hated strategy games but this one is pretty darn fun. Also my first time reviewing a game on steam so, that should tell you something.			",112,12,7,35,9,1,7

												Absolutely awesome game. The Kings Bounty series remains one of my favorites of all time, and one of the only series I'll actually replay through several times. It's an exploration game where you lead armies around the world, picking up relics and leveling up your character. It plays similarly to games like Heroes of Might and Magic, but the major difference (and the reason I like this series better), is you are encouraged and rewarded for exploring. There is no turn counter while you explore the map, putting you in a race against other towns or enemies. Explore as much as you want and roam everywhere without fear that your enemy is building up their army while you have fun. If you run into an area where the enemy is too strong for you, just explore somewhere else and come back once you gain some levels and spells.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												King's bounty plays a lot like Heroes of Might and Magic, whenever you have an encounter on the overworld you have stacked units on a hex board with turn based combat. You get a dragon that can cast a spell per turn (increased turn cooldown depending which spell you choose) and your hero character (the armored princess) can cast a spell per turn. Your hero character equips armor and weapons that change your hero's stats. The hero isn't involved in combat other than spells but your stats are attributed to your units in combat. Overall King's bounty is one of my favorite games and it is oddly addicting.			",78,19,0,30,2,0,23

												Similar to Heroes of Might and Magic, King's Bounty will keep you coming back if you are strategy fan. It does away with city building, and focuses on combat, hero building, and troop selection. Add a pet dragon that can turn the tide of battle, numerous artifacts you can find or buy, a varied pool of troops to select from, and a well thought out hero skill tree, King's Bounty Crossworlds is fantastic.Highly recommended if you like fantasy strategy games that are challenging, and doubly recommended if you loved Heroes of Might and Magic.

Want to go on an epic adventure with an army and combat like in the HoMM games? This game is what you should buy, then! It's the HoMM experience without city building, but more features in other areas, where you go around hiring allies for your army, to engage in combat in that exciting HoMM way!

												This game is just too pretty for words, and it runs very well on my almost 5 year old laptop on mostly high settings. Heck, even on all low settings the game is still beautiful.Now to the gameplay: The combat plays very much like the HoMM series, yet is still quite unique and diverse. I'm someone who finds it rather difficult getting into HoMM-like games because I love that series so much, but this game... is so unique and fun that I can't help but love everything about it. I love the free-roaming, the easy to use interface, the sea faring and quirky humour. I love the different units and all their special abilities, I lovelovelove my dragon which is so useful! Even the music is breathtakingly beautiful and sets the mood so well.This game is definitely worth the price. I grabbed it on a sale hoping to god it would run okay-ish on my laptop. It does and is worth every cent!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												King’s Bounty: Crossworlds is a fantastic game which features aspects of RPG & Turn-Based Strategy. It offers you the main campaign (Orcs on the March: Expansion for Armored Princess with additional content) and 2 other smaller campaigns (Champion of the Arena: Boss Battles in Gladiatorial Combat & Defender of the Crown: Battles in Unique Arenas). It is suppose to be similar to the HOMM & Fallen Enchantress, but it feels more enjoyable with the main campaign lasting between 40-60 hours. You get to choose between 3 starting classes (Warrior, Paladin, Mage), each with a special ability (skill) and with crossoworlds, you receive an additional skill, which varies depending on your class. You also get a pet dragon, which can ""cast"" special dragon abilities, which are really cool!! Overall the game is worth playing and I would recommend it!!Pros: Beautiful MusicSpells & Pet DragonRandomized ""Worlds"" (No 2 playthroughs are the same)Good StoryLots of different types of units to use, ranging from humans, to undead to dragons…Cons: Learning curve is a bit high (but once you figure out the game, it is really easy)The first 4 islands can be hard for a new player			",187,26,2,73,29,4,51

At the time of my writing this I believe I have about 10 hours of play time.Pros:-I love getting destroyed when I go to locations I should be-Lots of varied mission objectives-Feels like a ton of customization features when it comes to your troops and your skillsCons:-Biggest complaint is just the amount of text, be prepared to do a lot of reading if you want to follow the story.

												King´s Bount Crossworlds is based on the same (successful) receipt of the Legend, focusing on RPG turn-based strategy.The game does not include major changes or updates so if you loved/hated the original you will have the same feelings here. It requires careful planning on how to upgrade your hero, equip her with artifacts and spells and form your army. Upgrading the hero is limited by crystal that have to be consumed to level-up the skill tree. Spell allocation and upgrade is done through the use of (limited in number) crystals and formation of army is limited by leadership, economics and availability of specific army types. The combination of these elements, and the turn-based character of the battles, add a thick strategic layer that require thinking. If you are rookie you may end up easily without army or resources very early in the game.Pros:+ excellent strategic element, turn-based strategy at its best+ nicely done graphics for environment and units+ beautiful sound (although one could claim that it is too similar to Legend)+ huge variety of units, spells and artifacts+ great repliability as mage, warrior or paladin and by combining different kinds of units+ nice RPG elements in hero evolution, you end up as a killing machine+ minor clever changes with respect to Legend that improved on some cons of the original: ability to fly and thus accelerate travel, more maps with shorter surfaces to cover+ one new class of units (lizards)+ interesting boss battles that play differently than regular conflicts+ companion is an interesting addition, similar to the spirits of Legend + very similar to Legend, if you loved it (like me)Cons:- very similar to Legend, if you disliked it- too similar to Legend, especially with respect to the places visited. I would like to see more new places and units- perhaps there are too many spells, some of them never to be used, you can easily spend too many crystals on them, some hero skills seem irrelevant so are many units- most of boss battles require specific tanking approach that can be repetitive. Would like to see distinctly different boss battles- as with Legend if you are new it is very easily to get confused by the game mechanics early in the game. A tutorial could be helpfulAll in all, heartily reccomended. As a player who has invested lots and lots of hours in turn-based games  I rank this is one at the very top: one of the shining examples, up there with Heroes of Might and Magic III and King´s Bount Legend. On a side note, for the next chapters of the franchise I would like to see more drastic changes (hopefully not leading to a downhill path as HOMM).			",609,272,14,86,47,5,125

												King's bounty is great because it's an army management game, but combined with rpg elements. Other than the Might and Magic series, there aren't a lot of games like it. Where Might and Magic focuses more on resources, city management, and grand strategy, King's Bounty offers the other side of the coin; the loot hunting, skill tree level ups, and a grand world filled with multiple areas/islands to explore. There's a story too, but it's a bit on the light side. You'll find hours of entertainment here if any of the qualities above pique your interest.			",157,42,5,21,16,0,10

												The Kings Bounty series is interesting. It's cute but a failure to innovate the series leaves new players a choice of 4 or 5 ames that are essentially the same. Crossworlds is probably the best of the King's Bounty series. The game is bright, colorful and interesting to explore. Having an interesting game world goes a long way in keeping your interest.The gameplay is rather simple. Buy your troops (these increase over time) and go fight battles. Again and again and again. It's tough to figure out why I like this game so much because it is so repetitive. But every battle is different, every combination of troops a potential interesting tactical puzzle to solve and there's always something - a quest, an area or just a distant castle - to keep you moving foward. There's always a challenge out there and there's always a new, interesting place to visit and cool, different types of troops to use. There's always a new spell to use or upgrade, and new item to equp or a new skill to choose. The rewards are well paced and keep the player interested in the game.Now I believe sometimes a game can take too long and this is one. It would have been a better game at 20 hours. After wa while you may very well get bored with the formula. In fact, it could be said that the game may be best played on easy just so you can move through the content as quickly as possible. But it's one of those titles that you can dive back into and pick up at any time. The formula works well enough despite the repitive nature of the game. It's cute, it's fun and it's worth the money.			",81,36,8,60,54,5,57

												Probably the best turn-based strategy game ever made. It easily wins from any of the games of the Heroes of Might and Magic series (yes, even the 4th one!!), because it has much more depth to the strategy in the game. Units have diferent abilities, each class has diferent builds for their masteries and you have many more skills to choose from during the fight, and outside of it. There is also the rage system and the pet dragon, which are both very awesome ideas that improve even more your gameplay. Its definitely worth buying, so spread it to your friends! =)			",114,24,5,21,12,1,21

												I quit this game for awhile after the first time I played it about 10 hours into the game (level 12) because of my frustration with too much traveling and waiting and not being able to allocate my stats upon leveling up. Unlocking the pegasus ability greatly helped the former, but the latter is still a major downer. Why take the ability to allocate stats out of the game?Anyway, this game is much like its predecessor, King's Bounty: The Legend, but it isn't nearly as captivating. I figure one of the main reasons is that you spend a whole lot more time boating around as opposed to walking or flying to other places, which felt far more engrossing. I eventually came back to play it more and had a slightly better experience after getting over a hump in the gameplay. In any case, the game is still fun, and I can recommend it by itself, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it over The Legend. 6/10.			",102,35,2,32,34,2,37

												Repetitive, silly, grindy.  Love it.  Where else can you mix and match knights, archers, plants, wolves, spiders, dragons, snakes, undead, orcs, and robots?  The difficult part is that you can never clear a new area when you first arrive; there is always a stack or ten that completely outclass you;  once you have gone to a new area, gotten more and better troops and spells, you come back and kick those ""invincible"" dudes easily.  Huge world.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Basically a large add-on to Armored Princess with a couple short campaigns thrown in. Overall a very enjoyable package and since it includes Armored Princess I would definitely recommend purchasing Crossworlds instead of Armored Princess. Of course I love this series and so I have purchased King's Bounty: The Legend here on Steam AND on Good Old Games (shout out to the great gog.com) AND Armored Princess AND Crossworlds. It is just a shame they don't have Crossworlds on gog.com b/c I would buy another copy.If you love strategy games then buy this, you will love it.			",327,43,3,41,23,3,74

One can not simply comprehend how addicting this game is, with each battle and unit lost or gained, what you are capable of doing in-game shifts. Press your luck in highly hostile areas for amazing rewards, or derp around in weak zones building the perfect army, it's all up to you.			",134,17,1,28,8,2,21

It has RPG elements, turn-based strategy-style combat, grinding gameplay, well-written story, etc etc.If any of those things interest you then you should give the game a shot.

												I really enjoy the King's Bounty style of gameplay. It's a delicious blend of RPG and Strategy. It's also a constant struggle, as you try to conquer the map as efficiently as you can--while leveling up skills, equipping useful gear, acquiring magic and managing your choice of units. The gameplay and quests are repetitive to be sure, but it's still so darn addictive. To top it off, the game is also chock full of content, so much so that I'm not sure I'll ever complete it.

												If you're gonna get one of the King's Bounty games then this is the one you want!Awesome fusion of turn-based hexagon grid battles and RPG exploration, questing, level up, and choosing talents! The story isn't anything to write home about but there are many locations to see and explore - you can even sail around in a boat and eventually get a flying horse that'll REALLY speed up your trek across many islands and contenients!There are literally 100+ different unit types to choose from, tons of gear to find and equip to suit your build, and TONS of spells! to find and inscribe into your spellbook! If you love Heroes of Might and Magic, Disciples and other games like those then this is a MUST HAVE!			",244,33,5,58,32,1,65

												It is worth noting that this format of game is older than the similar Heros of Might and Magic series.  The game mechanic is similar however, you're are controlling only one ""Hero"".  I guess you could consider this a sub-set of ""HOMM"".  Basically this version is the best of the Kings Bounty series.It's a good looking game and although a bit repetative (aren't all RPG's), the combat still remains oddly interesting no matter how many times you do it...It's about the best combo of Strategy and RPG around (this includes HOMM also)...  Although I have not technically reviewed it; it's a bit like the matrix...  You have to see it for yourself...			",54,8,0,13,9,0,22

												This game is a good kind of differnt when it comes to RPGS I have played in the past.  While you do have a main hero, they are more of a commander and overlook the battles that your hired mercenaries take part in.  If you buy this it comes with Kings Bounty: Armored Princess so you will not need to buy that one at all. Also the Orcs campaign is the Armored princess game with extra updates so there is no reason unless you are a die hard fan to ever play the original.Pros+Interesting turn based RPG with many different elements effecting battle+4 different difficulties +Takes a while to learn but a long time to master+The items are very interesting and have qwirks about them such as a morale rating or life which will make you change your items or fight to keep them working+Vast land to run around+Pet Dragon helps in battle and levels up with you+Can choose from 9 baby dragons at the start which will change your starting tactics a lot+Large variety of Mercenaries to choose from which all have items that boost their stats+Large skill tree+You can also take on a helper who assists with different things and can also hold extra items+Mercenary attributes and abilities differ greatly between races/classes+Bosses are fun and different/There are other Hero Battles that change your tactics a bit+Replayability is pretty high considering you have 3 differnt classes and tons of items and mercs to choose from+Sets for items as well as ""Artefacts"" which have bonus effects when worn together+All the islands vary greatly in how they look and the feal about them+Game comes with the original version and two other modes as wellCons-Money is only gained through combat or on the ground in small doses and if you lose to many units and can't battle you may get into a tight situation-Lots of running around trying to find a max number of mercenaries for your pack-Story line isn't very important-Troops on certain islands can really range in difficulty making it hard to move about-Mercenaries have limits and can run out eventually-Training new mercs costs a ton of trophies which are gained from combat and you can easily run out-Mercenaries are at different locations and are sometimes extremely hard to find -You don't earn a better way of travel until about half way through the game			",249,54,6,59,17,5,42

If you're thinking about which KB to get I'd recommend the 1st one. And this one only if you're still wanting some extra KB. The game comes with the editor and enchanced campaign from the Armored Princess, so it provides this Extra with a big «E».			",193,43,2,23,6,5,31

												I don't know why it took me so long to get around to playing this. This is because the original King's Bounty was such a fascinating strategy sperger timesink that was pretty decent. However, if you HAVE to get one King's Bounty game, I wholly recommend Crossworlds, as it includes a much improved version of Armored Princess (the unofficial, much improved sequel) as well as several smaller campaigns that don't eat up much of your time but I assume are just as good. These are difficult games, but not on the level of Fate of the World or Bit.Trip Runner. Also you can send in an entire army of spiders to eat humans alive, I guess.			",452,99,7,53,31,2,53

												A spiritual sequel to the old King's Bounty game, these are massive strategy games with character progression and a good deal of customization. The game is pretty solidly balanced, and many different strategies will work. I got 85 hours out of King's Bounty: The Legend just going through the game once, and I have 93 hours in Armored Princess/Crossworlds. An important thing to note is that the Crossworlds expansion has an updated version of the Armored Princess campaign, so unless you want to play it twice you should probably do the Crossworlds version of it. I think both games in the series are worth playing.Only play on Hard if you are prepared for an actual challenge, because King's Bounty does not ♥♥♥♥ around. The Warrior class seems a little less viable on Hard than the others, but I still beat the game on Hard with a Warrior. You are likely to be required to change up your strategy at least partially depending on what resources you have at hand.			",171,31,2,16,12,1,24

												Probably my most favourite strategy games of all times and I've played them all. Thanks to King's Bounty I found a new joy of playing videogames again. On the surface it's a HOMAM ripoff of course but beneath it it's got so much more life, vibrancy, sparkle and  new ideas than the ever more listless iterations of HOMAM it has completely overshadowed its old teacher. The Legend, and especially it's perfected sequel Armored Princess, boasts THE best and most enjoyable tactical HOMAM-like combat of all games ever made, no contest.Unfortunately the publisher decided to milk the series dry and came up with two more sequels, Warriors of the North and Dark Side. Both games have the same exact engine with very few innovations. They're basically glorified custom campaings made in the Map Editor. The sparkle and magic are mostly gone and what we got was lifeless, dull grind, designed without much care or thought, probably by just a fragment of the original team (or maybe just a few interns), just to squeeze a few more dollars from the franchise. Avoid at all costs (Warriors of the North is still passable if you become a KB addict but definitelly avoid Dark Side).But the first two games are unambiguously great, full of wit and playful brilliance, and will forever remain in my heart.

												This is an excellent version of King's Bounty, I had a good time.This game runs flawlessly on my system on high settings and I've heard it runs very well for most people.I completed the Orcs on the March, the Champion Of The Arena, and the Defender Of The Crown Campaigns on Normal difficulties.This version features some extra campaigns you can do which are basically a boss rush and a condensed version of the game. Orcs on the March is the expansion to Armoured Princess, so you might as well play that version of the two.This series has a love it or hate it style of gameplay. The changes this game series has from version to version is very minor.It's a hex-grid turn based RPG, and when your not in battle, you will be clicking the landscape to explore the land, pick up items, searching for gold, talking to people for quests.The game can feel slow paced at times and the music is very classical so it's actually possible to doze off playing this game.If you enjoy the series or want to get into it, this is a fine game to spend time on.

The troops you can get are not only limited, but youll have to make trips back and forth to where you can buy them. These 2 elements combine to limit expirementation to extreme levels. I also have an issue with the battle elements. You have 3 main things to consider/use, your hero spells, your troops, and your dragon. I just dont feel like these 3 systems go well together. There is no cohesiveness. It feels like the troops should be the main focus but your skill tree only empowers one of these things which means you could end up in a situation where your just using your hero spells instead of troops.The story also takes ages to get going which hampers the expirence even further once youve seen everything the battle system has to offer.

												For an Armored Princess her suit seems to stop quite suddenly at the waist...but i digress.Not sure why you cant call your pet dragon for boss fights but otherwise a fairly straight forward fantasy strat game. Enemy difficulty seems to vary wildly depending on the class you pick, thankfully you can slip past most to grab key loot (like maps)If you like the battles in Age of Wonders this is worth a look.

												Just as solid as the other Kings Bounty games but with a new race (the Orcs) that keeps it fresh, they're tricky enough to keep you on your toes but not different enough to change the game in any dramatic way. Essentially more of the same, and that is not a bad thing at all.			",228,50,8,48,22,2,31

												As a serious strategy gamer - I really enjoy this game, alot. But there's a serious flaw: it's too easy unless it's on the hardest mode, but then it becomes unwinnable unless you use -one- tactic as a specific point in the game. So, once you get to snowy island with the machines and nords, get engineers, robots, and split your healer-bots into two groups. Make them heal each other. Now you've gotten through the unbalanced part of the game. Stop using that strategy if you want it to be at all challenging/fun.			",231,53,1,61,14,0,36

												While I enjoyed the King's Bounty games, this 'expansion' is a little misleading.  First of all, there is no real new campaign, but rather an alteration of the existing Armoured Princess campaign to add in some new variables, which does NOT update an existing AP game, meaning the only way to see this new content is to start a new campaign, which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.The other 'campaigns' can't really be called campaigns, but rather a couple of hours of gameplay (at most) additions that are 1 dimensional meh-fests.Avoid this unless the price drops below $5, as anything more is a complete rip-off.  Even at $5, this still feels like you got taken.			",539,129,32,84,37,6,95

												Identical to mechanics, graphics, music, characters, system, storyline, and enemies. The only thing different from this is the fact that it introduces an ""expansion"" to the original game in order to give more storyline. In all honesty, this game is technically an expansion, but it starts and has the exact same beginning, options, characters, and method as the original, where as its 'expansion' only takes place with a separate island and minor side quests. This game could have been easily added as an update and not the exact same. Sadly, like the original, you do not get a choice to select race, only difficulty of game, banner of flag, and style of character (warrior, paladin, mage). This game came in a bundle pack with the others while on sale. I would highly suggest not wasting your time on it.			",94,18,0,33,6,0,4

												I was looking forward to this game since I enjoy most turn-based combat games. I have never been so disappointed in a game. It's nearly impossible to advance past a certain point without repeatedly dying. There are no opportunities for grinidng, so if you come up against an enemy you can't handle and you've already killed all the easy ones: you're screwed. The combat is repetitive and unrewarding. Having to dispatch groups of 100+ minions is boring to the point of tears. Spend your money elsewhere.			",67,53,0,35,4,1,9

Yeah, it was so long and boring, I did it just because of my passiiom to The Legend... King's Bounty: The Legend is the best King's Bounty ever. The remaining part of this franchise is not so good.

												This continues a fantastic series which predated the original Heroes of Might and Magic. This title, released about 20 years after the original, is both quite faithful and a fantastically fun game. The artefact system is like the HoMMIII and the skills like Diablo II. That enough makes it a challenge between where to boost your army and what skills to enhance your and their abilities. Having played both Armored Princess and this, I'd give my recommendation to this game. It has certain quests that I thouroghly enjoyed and many new and powerful units. This game did crash more than Armored Princess. That's a total of 1. I set sail for a new island and crashed hard.I will say that the other games attached to this are kind of crap. The arena is basically all the boss fights. The lizardmen campain is nearly worthless. They are thankfully short and, I suppose, good for a quick dose of the gameplay without getting sucked in to the main storyline.The graphics are old, but haven't started showing their age just yet. The sound is slightly repetitive. Some of the quests are best skipped.Overall, you won't be disappointed.			",212,45,4,38,20,3,52

												This is a casual RPG. It is a great time-waster, assuming you do not require depth and sophistication, and prefer a casual treadmill over a more intense, rollercoaster experience.As others have pointed out, this plays like Heroes of Might & Magic, stripped of all superfluous base management and strategy elements.For those wondering, this is the best place in the series to begin. It has all the new bells and whistles, cutscenes, new unlockable passive abilities, large scale maps, and now leveleable troops.The combat is also more dynamic, containing obstacles and large bosses.This is purely the definition of a ""fun,"" novelty game.And it is not a flop like Dark Side, either.

												I got this game in a bundle with 4 others for $6 on sale.  I have put over 26 hours into the game so far, and while I have gotten somewhat tired of the game, I have thoroughly enjoyed it.  What I can't emphasize enough is the value that comes with this game.  26+ hours in, and I still haven't beat the first of the four campaigns; I am probably 75% through the campaign I am in right now.  There is easily 100+ hours of content in this game, way more than you get out of most AAA titles, and at around 10-15% of the price (on sale).   The graphics remind me of an updated version of Warcraft 3 (which I love), and I really enjoyed the combat.  If you are a fan of these types of games, there is no reason why you shouldn't pick up Kings Bounty: Crossworlds.			",76,2,0,21,3,0,10

												When I've purchased this game I thought that it was just another standalone title of the franchise but I've got really surprised to know that it was basically a polished version of 'Armored Princess'. Yes, there's actually a raw copy of 'Armored Princess', plus another one that includes an expansion pack about orcs, which brings some new quests, items etc. Besides that, there're also two other mini campaign modes available. In one of them, you're this random guy who find himself in an arena and have to fulfill certain missions in order to be able to gain influence and recruit stronger creatures to fight against the bosses. The other one I'd say that is like a 'training drill' for Amelie, where you have to go through a few difficult battles in order to prove your value or something. Anyway, both of these can be finished quite easily. Overall, if you haven't bought 'Armored Princess' yet, I'd strongly advise you to just skip it, because this title is unarguably superior.
