												Oh boy, this game.Well, it's fun, the combat is very fast paced and fun, you can do a lot of moves with you skills and magic and abilities, you can combine them or charge them for a more powerful attack. This game is HUGE, the map is VERY HUGE, there is a lot of dungeons and there is like 300 or 400 side quests to be done, but  it is very unlikely that you will want to do every single one, you see, some of them, some of the quests are like the generic MMO quests (grab question with NPC > kill x things > collect x things > go back to NPC), but there is a lot of side quests very well done and with a nice story. Play this game on HARD, because even on HARD it will be kinda easy, seriously, you will only face a challenge if you decide to fight more than 6 enemies (of your LVL - the ones with the name in YELLOW) at once or an enemy with an ORANGE or RED name.There is a lot of things to say about this game, but let me give you some tips that won't ruin your fun.If you want to kill enemies with one or two hits, pick  BLACKSMITH and JEWELCRAFTING skill to level up, you will be able to craft your own gear, but you can make some GODLY gear, like, you can gain +60% DMG with FIRE DMG and LIFE LEECH and a insane amount of ARMOR, you will never die, really, it will look like GOD MODE. If you wanna some challenge in the fights and if you wanna use the nice sets and unique gear that you will find in the game (the uniques and set items are way more nice than the crafted ones, they are very stylish and have some nice stats and their own lore/description, but they don't have stats so powerful like the crafted gear), don't level up BLACKSMITHING, go for JEWELCRAFTING (to sell the jewels) and MERCANTILE so you can make a lot of money (i end up with 12 millions GOLD and wasn't even in the end of the game, i had like 25 hours or more till the final boss).Try to acquire the DLCs, Ded Kel and Teeth of Naros, they are very nice and the Ded Kel can grant you some nice things, like, you can acquire the best items for crafting (the FLAWLESS components, they grant insane stats for crafted gear) and a lot of uniques and set items (set gear) for FREE (the components are not free, but the gear that one NPC search for you is free), a NPC will get them for you.Choose well the color of the eye of your character, you won't be able to change this after, only hair and jewels and tattoos once you gain your own house (there is like 3 or 4 houses only for your character in the game).Try to do all the faction quests, they give you nice rewards and you end up meeting new NPCs and enjoying the stories.Try to level up the DETECT HIDDEN skill, it will help you a lot. Don't bother, seriously, don't bother with LOCKPICKING and PERSUASION (PERSUASION can be nice if you really want some more dialogues, but it is not necessary), LOCKPICKING is useless, really, you will find some hard chests to lockpick, but after 3 or 4 lockpicks (and you will find and will be able to afford a lot of those lockpicks) you will end up opening the chests without problem. Try to level up DISPELLING, it will help you on magic chests and will prevent you for being cursed (curses can't be removed without a HEALER, and you will be forced to travel to a city or village to lift the curse, otherwise you can continue exploring, but some curses can make your character very vulnerable, very weak).Try to read all the books you find, really, they can give you a nice understanding of the lore and they have some very interesting information, also, some of them are hilarious.***If you want more challenge, you can try to use the YSA mod, it is a mod to be used with the Cheat Engine program, it changes the game to be way more challenging, i've never used but a lot of people said that it is very well done and you can choose what to use (like, you can disable the way your character receives damage [with the mod your character receives 2x or 3x more damage from the enemies] or the XP gain [experience is reduced by default with the mod]). ***There is lot of more i would like to say, but i don't remember everything now. I hope this review help you.Thanks for reading.			",83,3,2,15,3,0,8

Personal rating: 8/10DLC: Worth it. They add more to the game with new equipment and quests. The Weapon Bundle gives a nice helping hand for beginners, but NOT overpowered stuff.First thoughts on Kingdoms of AmalurI bought Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning on a 70% Sale and left the game while I played other things and wasn't feeling like giving it a try yet. I wasn't expecting anything spectacular, something Torchlight-Diablo-esque perhaps.Turned out I was wrong.The gameplayKingdoms of Amalur Reckoning has a moderately paced action packed battle where you can roll (or blink if you're a Sorcery user) to dodge and block or parry incoming attacks as long as you have the reflexes.Every type of weapon feels unique and finding one that suits you the best might be a decisive point when you're aiming for a class (or rather, destiny). From swords to scepters, hammer to staves, bows to daggers and even chakrams, nothing is useless here. It may take some getting use to, but every weapon has its charm, its pros and cons. Every weapon has its gimmick and is impressive how different they feel, most of times a different type of weapon requires a different approach in combat.The camera while fighting is somewhat weird, not unbearable but it can get more in your way than the enemies themselves sometimes. The game will focus on whatever hit you and sometimes if the enemy is past behind you the camera may follow him instead of keeping focus on the one you are trying to kill. This show how important is to have a lock-on option in games with such combat system.Terminate with extreme prejudiceOne of the most memorable features of Kingdoms of Amalur is something introduced early for you: Fateshift. Fateshift is the usual ""super mode"" you activate once you gauge is completely filled.Why is it so memorable? The finishing moves, oh dear, the finishing moves.Few games make you feel so powerful like Kingdoms of Amalur does. When you see the first Fateshift finisher, which probably will be on a creature that is times bigger than you, you'll feel like you are unstoppable. And then you'll do it on a human sized enemy and it'll just scream OVERKILL. Nevertheless you probably won't be saving Fateshift too much because you'll want to see every last of the finisher moves, they are THAT awesome.Class building is fun, having unlimited re-specs (for a price) is betterThe game offers a lot of variety with classes and mix-ups every possible combination and you can build your character as you see fit, and if you don't like it you can re-spec as many times as you want. But keep in mind the re-specs WILL get pricey fairly quick (after the 4th re-spec you'll notice). While gold may be easy to come later on, at the beginning it surely isn't.The usual combat approachWant to get in the face of enemy and take everything head on with heavy armor and huge melee weapons? Might is your path.Maybe you like to kill enemies at a safe distance with flashy spells? Sorcery it is then.Or do you prefer backstabs and bows? Finesse is perfect for you.However...Might, Finesse or Sorcery? Why choose only one?Really. Why should you become just a brutish Warrior? Why become a squishy Archer/Assassin? Why become a frail Wizard? Why when you can become a Warrior with magic, an Archer that's as deadly at long range as it is up close, or a Wizard that can use sneaky tricks if magic fails him.Not satisfied? Mix EVERYTHING. Become an Universalist.The best of Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning is how it is possible to mix up EVERY class in the game. There are no boundaries in this game: you can mix Warrior, Thief and Wizard in any way you find better, nothing is stopping you. Doing this will often give you amusing results.Of course that ""pure breed"" classes will have its unique advantages and some powers that only they can access, but mixed classes often have their own bonuses that, with the right gear, will more than make up for those last skills you can't afford.Still about class buildingOne of the aspects I like the most in Kingdoms of Amalur: the complete LACK of status points. No Strenght, no Dexterity, no Intelligence to worry about, no ""status puzzle"" of sorts, just skill points that should be invested in the three skill three which will grant different amounts of HP and MP.A world to explore, quests to doFrom simple quests like ""Kill this"" to ""Bring me that"" to ""Deliver this"" to ""Keep me alive"" to ""Save the damn world"", you'll have your hands full everywhere you go.There are long questlines from specific factions that will grant you a special reward in the end. But with a twist: most of times you have the option to join the ""hero"" or the ""villain"" (opinions may vary) of said questline, and whoever you take the side will grant a different, permanent bonus. Some choices may have a deep impact in your game.Colorful, ""brightful"" and beautifulI normally avoid talking about graphics since opinions about it are arbitrary, but like Just Cause 2, Kingdoms of Amalur has incredible graphics and effects even on its lowest setting.Spell effects are impressive and for once the often overlooked warriors and thieves gains extremely flashy and beautiful skills and attacks to watch, which I must say, is immensely refreshing to see.Complaints, because though great, the game is very far from perfectFirst, look at any review from Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning and you'll find out that everyone says the game is too easy even on Hard. They are not exaggerating, if you pick a Might class and become a tank it won't be long until you realize enemies are barely doing a scratch on you and only the most dangerous, most powerful enemies will pose a threat to you. On the other hand playing as Finesse and Sorcery characters will require care and proper dodge/parry skills as while they can dish, they can't take as well.Indoor scenarios will seem repetitive after a while, especially cave and castle/fortresses ones, they may have different coloring, but that's about it. To make this worse the game has a tendency to grow quiet, musicless, on these areas.Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning has a decent repertory of enemies, but they are not enough. You'll encounter the same kind of enemies in several different areas from the start to the end of the game, some of the human opponents are mere re-skins of other enemies and there are even bosses who are simply overpowered enemies you'll find around, maybe with a gimmick or two, but that's about it.The game also suffers with a problem that will show up for completionists: doing all sidequests will make you level up faster and you might end up reaching the level cap even before you travel to the last country (which is big on its own accord) which can easily frustrate people.Another common complaint is how forgettable the main storyline is. Side quests are much more enjoyable and have many more noteworthy characters with more interesting back stories that most characters from the main story barely seems to have at all. Wrapping upEven with its flaws and problems Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning is a memorable game with a lot of nice characters, nice combat system and interesting quests with a maybe not-so-great main story, but it never fails to deliver what intends to.In the end the saddest thing is that the developer (Big Huge Games) bankrupted and we will never get newer stuff for the game like spears or even bug fixes or a new level cap. And a sequel probably will never come to a light either.			",222,43,3,24,9,0,13

												Not a very popular game but I like it very much. One of the best RPG's I have ever played. It deserved to but a greater sucess than it was. Seems it was knocked off the radar with the release of Skyrim, but in many ways I find it a better game to sink time into. Combat is great fun in this game. The world is vast, beatiful and creative with lots of side quests to keep you exploring. The story line is a bit meh and could have been better.  I've put all my skill points into Sorcery which is awesome to play, and can't wait to try the others. I recomend Blacksmithing, Sagecraft, a little stealth (unless you are a Rogue, then lot's), detect hidden and persuasion. Gold is very easy to acculate in the game. Two thumbs for Kingdom of Amalur Reckoning.			",36,6,0,14,2,0,2

												This is truly a gem in the rpg genre. Its got everything a rpg should have like:- A open world with, like skyrim guilds to join en other sidequest as you explore- A fun and simple crafting system- Some funny humor and dialog.- Awesome combat, let's you choose what you will become, and you can become alot. Like a mix between a mage and a rogue. - Some clever bossfights- Lots and lots of loot and dungeonsEven the two dlc packs are awesome. But this does have some lame♥♥♥♥♥fetch this, kill this, retrieve that missions. But most of them are sidequest and can be easly ignored. It takes alot of time to finsh this game and the plentyfull sidequest/guild missions keeps you occupied for some time. So looking for a good action rpg, then picks this game up.

												KoA: Reconing is a fantastic, underrated 3rd person, open world RPG.  The game features an excellent plot, huge world, combined with truly customizable character classes.   For those of you who don't know the story behind this game's development, it was founded by Curt Schilling (former MLB pitcher) who was a fan of games when he wasn't playing baseball.  He sunk a ton of his own money into trying to make this game (and franchise) great but in the end it was a bit too ambitious for a startup company and they went bankrupt after releasing the game.  What does this all mean?  Well, it means the game has AAA quality production values but is often overlooked.  In short, it's a hidden gem that most likely will never get a sequel, but is a really well done game. The game's plot and setting are quite good overall.  As part of the world building, bestselling fantasy author RA Salvatore (the creator of Drizzt) wrote over 1000 pages of plot and backstory to make this world come alive.  The result is not your typical generic fantasy world, but a world with a rich history that isn't just the same old elves and orcs all over again.   I enjoyed the plot and setting of the game.  The main plot reveals rather slowly, but the last few chapters of the main plot are quite interesting.  Of course, there are TONS of sidequests and 4 full factions to explore as well, as well as two full expansions that are worth getting. Graphically, the world is very beautiful and some of the cities and outdoor settings are quite unique.   My favorite was the city of Ysa, which was built into the trees.  It's hard to get a sense of the game's graphics due to the 3rd person nature of the game.  Just looking at screenshots doesn't do it justice because your character is always standing in the middle of the screen, but when you can pan the camera around and explore the worlds, it's beautiful.  Level design is also very solid.  There's tons of areas to explore, lots of secrets, and the world map and quest system keeps you from getting lost.   My one complaint about the level design is that your character cannot jump in most places, but can only jump from certain spots.  The game's soundtrack is memorable and sound effects are also high quality, as to be expected.Combat is the main part of the game and luckily, it's very fun.  Unlike most RPGs, you truly are free to design a character that is exactly how you want to play.  You're not penalized for being a hybrid character, in fact you can prettymuch use whatever main and secondary weapons you like along with fighting styles, stealth, and magic skills.  Want to play a mage that wears robes and fights with a big hammer?  Sure, there's spells to boost your armor, heal, and a summons to help distract enemies in combat.  Want to play a stealthy assassin that uses magery to stun from afar.  Go for it!  You can also play a pure fighter, mage, or rogue and enjoy the game that way as well.  It's easy to respec your character when you want to try something different.  There's also a deep crafting system for potions, armor, and magic gems that you can get into or completely ignore.  The game also keeps the crafting skills separate from the combat skills, so you're not forced into going into blacksmithy as a warrior or gemcrafting as a mage, for instance.Fighting enemies themselves is quite fun.  Most regular enemies are pretty easy to destroy, so your character feels quite powerful.  Luckily, the boss fights can be pretty difficult and are very epic!  Be prepared to mow over most weak enemies and have some challenges with the various boss fights.  The game features achievements as well and all of them work.  You can 100% the game in about 70ish hours, in one playthrough.  Luckily, there's a lack of super grindy achievements and a lot of them are fun to get.  You'll need both expansions to 100% the game, but I would highly recommend both expansions as well.  The bundle for the game goes on sale quite often, so pick up the deluxe edition!  There are a few negatives that I must mention.  The number 1 complaint about this game is that it is too easy.  If you do every faction, sidequest, and area in the main game and both expansions, you will reach the level cap far before the end of the plot.  To remedy this, I recommend playing the game on hard mode.  It does not make the game too difficult, it merely balances it out to be about the average difficulty for most games.  Even if you are someone who normally plays games on normal or even easy mode, I highly recommend playing on hard mode so that it's simply not a pushover.   I ended up playing the game for about 13 hours on medium difficulty before deciding it was too easy and starting over.  Just play it on hard to begin with.  There's also an achievment for beating the game on hard mode and if you find the game to be too challenging, you can always just level up or even lower the difficulty if you have to.The game does feature a huge amount of optional sidequests along with 4 factions.  If you do every optional sidequest and kill every enemy that crosses your path, you will be overleveled before the end.  Therefore, I recommend doing   the main plot, all 4 factions, both DLC and a just a few sidequests.  Doing this will keep the game challenging to the end of the main story.  Also, after the main story ends you are still free to continue the game and play all of those sidequests.  The game actually has so much content that you could probably replay a second time doing only sidequests and level up to max.   It is also very easy to outmanuver enemies and run past them, which cuts down on the tedium of killing monsters that respawn after a day or two.  Another complaint I had was that the game tends to reuse enemy graphics quite a bit.  The enemies are well animated, but the game could use a bit more variety.   Finally, the last few areas of the game are pretty difficult and sort of turn into a potion swilling festival.  However, despite these drawbacks, the game is extremely solid overall and highly recommended.  If you enjoy open world style games, this is certainly one to pickup and play.  It has a detailed plot, a well developed world, beautiful graphics, fun combat, epic and challenging bosses, a complex but optional crafting system, truly customizable classes, a variety of powerful weapon choices, and is a huge kingdom to explore for many hours.   Just play on hard mode and don't do every sidequest and you're sure to enjoy this hidden gem of a 3rd person rpg!  If you enjoyed Skyrim, chances are you will like this game.  I would even go as far to say that the combat and boss battles are better in KoA!  Give this game a chance and you'll be glad you did.			",132,64,7,64,43,0,51

												Underrated story-driven RPG (console port)Pros: Fun rogue/mage hybrid, good stealth. Good map and dungeon design. Loot feels worthwhile. Every quest is part of a story arc. Good world-building, plenty of details. Decisions have an effect on the game.Cons: Block/stagger mechanic is over-used. Poor PC controls (much better with a controller) Cannot zoom out (can use WideScreenFixer) Only supports XBox controllers (can use x360ce)Game-breaking stuff: Play the game on Hard, otherwise it's too easy. There's an achievement for it, too. Don't enter new areas (loading screen) too early; new zones are locked to your current level. Avoid bonus XP, since it will over-level you too quickly. Don't max out Blacksmithing, it will quickly make all loot redundant. Limit the number of health potions you carry :PIf you're a PC gamer, you might be inclined to try to dodge everything.This can work in late-game, but early on you will need to block more than you dodge.Things you need to know: Block early, block often. It's a console thing. This alone will make the game 50% easier. Be aggressive. The more you hit enemies, the less they hit you (because they are staggered) Don't try to dodge small melee attacks. If you can see the attack, it's too late to dodge in most cases. Dodge is for boss attacks and blinking through enemies. Especially trolls. You can block (or riposte) later than you can dodge. You can block magic, and wolves. Chakrams don't interrupt attacks. Use daggers for that, or stay mid-range. Daggers are awesome. ",94,51,0,29,2,0,1

												(Played over 300+ hours non-Steam)This game belong in the pantheon of the greatest RPGs ever created!The combat is pretty much Fable, Skyrim & God of War put into 1 game with a wonderful execution, the most enjoyable combat system that I have ever come across.The world is huge and encourages you to explore it - there is a lot of lore present & quite a lot of interesting characters too. Also, the characters have a LOT to say, and it seems that every voice (which are a lot) are all different & it brings out a lot of immersion. A lot of variety in the areas you can visit too, you have deserts, plains, marshes, canyons and what not.Almost nothing bad about this game, perhaps sometimes a bit texture pop-in, some boring fetch quests & characters that look-a-like, but the story is thick & it has literally 1000s of side-quests. You can buy houses, explore big cities, craft & more! Everything you want in a RPG!It has a great ton of customization that allows you to change your skills & magic abilities on the fly, always be able to go with per example a Templar - using Magic & Heavy armor, or a Sorcerer, fully magic specced with robes & chakrams (Xena's weapons!) or a Thief, wielding light weapons with hints of magic - it is literally ALL possible!There are many weapons too, Daggers, Bows, Fae Blades, Greatswords, Hammers, Sceptres, Staffs, Chakrams, and more that I cannot remember. It has any weapon you could think of in an  - and I did not even mention the magical abilites which are very numerous & work well together.It also has a GREAT crafting mechanic that will have you searching all corners of the world for things to use, and as I said, it encourages it. Combined with the crafting mechanic itself is also sagecrafting - that allows you to create gems to use with equipment to enhance stats.All in all, this is probably one of the best RPGs that I have ever played. It's a truly, really commendable game that every RPG lover should play!Personal score: 9/10Best regards,Dukhat			",322,36,20,43,39,3,72

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning Original Release: 2012 Genre Tags: RPG; Action; Story-Rich; Epic Fantasy; Adventure My Overall Grade: A Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 50-150 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Strong narrative advocates; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Fantasy buffs REVIEWKingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning™ is a highly underrated, and truly epic, action-RPG.  Boasting hours and hours of content, it is loaded with a rich narrative and plenty of lore aspects to intrigue the fantasy buff in you.  It also has great RPG elements that will keep you striving to evolve your character. So if you enjoy that type of thing, and want to get immersed in a humongous game, then you should give this some consideration.  The graphics are absolutely charming; and the gameworld is massive, variable, and captivating. It is very fun to explore the environments in search of loot and lore.  The controls are fluid and intuitive, and the combat is exciting and flexible. And the whole experience flows very naturally, so it is the type of game that is easy to get caught up in for hours on end.There are tons of things to do and places to explore.  There is also a myriad of lore in the game and many NPCs to have extensive dialogues with. If you enjoy delving deep into the worlds of fantasy games, you’ll have plenty to work with.  There is also a huge variety of different enemies to vanquish, so your bloodlust should be satiated as well.  There are plenty of levels to be gained, abilities to be learned, items to loot, and armor sets to (try to) complete.  And there are over 200 quests, or far more if you pick up the DLC.  In short: it is undeniably an RPG of epic proportions. Moreover, considering it can easily last 100+ hours, the developers did a good job diversifying the content so it doesn’t grow too stale towards the end.One exceptionally cool feature of the game is that you can freely respec as often as you want and change between mage, warrior, and rouge classes (or cross-class combinations thereof).  This helps keep things fresh through the lengthy campaign, and prevents you from having to pick a single playstyle for the entire game.There are also a couple of DLC campaigns available for Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning™. They are both quite lengthy and add a very large amount of content to the experience. I definitely recommend picking up the whole package, however be prepared for a game that will take about 150 hours for completionists.So Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning™ is undeniably epic, massive, and downright fun.  If you enjoy huge RPGs like Skyrim or Dragon Age: Origins then you will probably enjoy this, perhaps lesser known, but similar, game.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

TL:DR? See ConclusionNOTE: Despite my game time, I actually finished this game on the Xbox360INTRODUCTION:Kingdoms of Amalur is a single player RPG developed by Big Huge Games with 38 Studios for both Console and the PC. One of the notable personalities involved in its development is former Major League Baseball player and known avid World of Warcraft subscriber Curt Schilling, the founder of 38 Studios.The game places you in the role of the “Fateless One”, a mysterious character who was recently resurrected back from the dead and discovers a new found power to change destiny itself. Travel the land of Amalur in search of answers on why you were recalled back into the land of the living and at the same time, learn more about a great war in the east against an immortal race called the Tuatha Deohn and why they want you dead...again.PROS:+ Beautiful Graphics, models, animation and special effects+ Stunning scenery, levels and environment+ Healthy game time that doesn't get too boring+ Expansive world which rewards exploration with...+ Good loot, item and weapon variety+ Fun combat regardless of the class you're playing+ Crafting system is deep but easy to understand+ Class System is VERY extensive (want to make a warhammer wielding wizard that's good with stealth? Then why not? This game lets your cross-class as much as you want.)+ Good enemy design and variety+ Lots of fun side quests (Also a CON)+ Fun and relatively long DLC story (Legend of Dead Kel was fun for me)+ Nice, straight forward story that is complicated enough to not get boring, but simple enough to follow.CONS:- Way too EASY, even on the hardest difficulty. This is possibly the BIGGEST CON of the game (There is a mod to fix this and I have provided it in the comment section below)- Player customization is very limited- Some forgettable npc characters- Too many side quest (Also a PRO) that levels you up too quickly even before you reach the end of the game, this results in...- Boredom will set in after max level, specially if you max out before the final stage- Money becomes irrelevant really quickly- Generic world and story- Massive map with NO MOUNT (Jogging Simulator 2011)CONCLUSION:It's a NICE RPG game that provides several hours of entertainment. If you have an itch for an MMORPG but can't be bothered with the complications of playing with other people, then this game is right up your alley.The game boast a very beautiful and colorful art style, enjoyable levels and scenery with a fun combat mechanic. The game play gets boring at times because the difficulty curve is too easy and provides no challenge. It has a big expansive map with lots of places to explore, but gets tedious because of the lack of mount. Still, all in all, I can easily RECOMMEND this game while on sale.  If MMORPG games are Cigarettes, then Kingdoms of Amalur is the Nicotine Patch.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												Pros: So many quests, side quests, never ending tasks, and faction quests.  The amount of stuff to do and travel in this game is massive.  Beautiful level designs, scenery, and colors create a visual fantasy experience.  Works well for a game controller.  Voice acting is decent.  The music is pretty good, too.  The Battle of Mel Senshir was the some of the most awesomeish boss battle ever in game history.Cons: Crazy camera angles that will leave you. Game difficulty, even on hard, is moderate to easy.  I don't think some tasks end.  The menus could be easier to navigate through. Repetitive dungeon levels.Major Con: Terrible, run of the mill main story line (You're the chosen one, must save the worlf from invading army storyline) wrapped in a burrito of everyone has a fate except you, the fateless one.  The side quests had more interesting plots than the main storyline.			",131,49,8,27,9,2,14

												Got this game the one time when it was a daily deal in March 2013. This was the only time it was on a discount other than it was first released on Steam. I would prefer the Steam version than the Origin version because of Steam Achievies and Steam Cloud. An easy underatted game because of the the lack of discounts. Don't let that stop you though. Fun gameplay in terms of action and RPGness. Along the same lines of Fable where you create and customize your character throughout the game. Do yourself a favor and not overlook this game because of the price. I would say wait for a sale but for this game, it doesn't appear to happen often.			",219,19,1,56,13,3,21

Product received for free
												Pros 'n Cons style.Pros:Great graphics.Great combat.Neat skill system.Good item system.Lots of dungeons.Good engine. (Exceptional performance on good to moderate hardware.)Looks great at 3840x2160.LOTS of content.Good voice acting.(Personally, I think it's beautiful, and has grrrreat animation quality.)Cons:No classical targeting system.No jump except at certain spots.Tons of invisible cockblock walls.Developer company and IP are effectively dead, mostly due to financial mismangement and a couple Rhode Island politicians that  are apparently soapy baby weiners. (Google ""Curt Shilling Rhode Island and the fall of 38 studios"" it's the NYTimes article.)Due to the massive content it tends to run a bit shallow.Graphical style is very good, but stylized, so may not be everyone's cup of tea.No reasonable mod support.Camera and general camera controls are both fully ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.A few bugs here and there that'll NEVER be fixed. (E.g quest log disappearing due to font scaling and 4k res.)Ultimately, it's a solid game, and really COULD have been ""The Next Big Thing"" but...yeah, read the article.Regardless, I recommend it. You'll know if you'll like it within the first hour or so.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Kingdoms of Amalur: ReckoningI have previously played a fair amount of this on Xbox, I am pleased to confirm this is not a bad port for the PC but would be better using a controller. Overall it's good enough, and shouldn't be over-looked beacuse of the native console settings.This game deserves the attention of any & all RPG fans, especially those who enjoy well versed fan-fiction & character art. The experience throughout the game delivers those elements not only consistently, but excellently; as well as any other I’ve played that never removed the presence of inquisition and curiosity. Delving dungeons, collecting loot – slaying mobs & basking shamelessly in NPC related debauchery. KoA:R strikes each node of the game’s fabric as a finely hit note under a bard’s fingers. KoA:R was unfortunately somewhat of a casualty, only in the sense that it did not rise above some other unnamed releases at the same time of its own decent onto the shelves. That said, those who have played the game will no doubt recommend it faster than they would other titles played in the same genre. There is a wealth of lore, items & art in the game that is unmeasurable against some of those other games you may list out next to KoA. The type that comes from the most experienced & creativity proficient in the business – combining the talents of R.A Salvatore (One of my most influential and favourite authors) & Todd McFarlane (needs no introduction) the story and the world that holds it has been extruded into an exquisite universe contained onto this game. Game developers usually spend decades writing & elevating this amount of content and lore into a functioning, well balanced & infinitely fun game. There are few areas where KoA flounders; fortunately, these areas do not impact so far as to deter the player away at any time. The inventory system There are 3 schools of fighting that your hero can choose to be disciplined in; Might, Finesse & Sorcery – you are not bound to any one skill line at any time, but may want to be more heavily balanced towards one for equipment requirements. That said, a mix of 2 or even all 3 really makes the combat new and doesn’t go stale from using the same abilities and slaying enemies in a linear, uniform pattern. Each tree will grant you 3 points per level to spend freely in either tree. There’s even a respec feature in the game where you can ‘re-write’ your fate and change your play style if you grow bored or have a change of heart with your skill.The campaign offers 10-12 hours of gameplay if you’re strictly ignoring the heaps of side-quests. Add those and DLC, there is well over 100+ hours for you to get your ample fill. Some parts become tedious as there is no great way to get around the massive map so playing systematically, almost like an MMO can wear you down as the player or give you a real grind element to the game. This will sate an itch for a lot of gamers but create black holes for others and can alter the players overall experience. On sale, this game is a steal given it has more content than many new AAA titles and belongs in a lot of gamer’s library with all the features & replay-ability.7.5/10 ",372,95,31,62,56,2,76

												To be honest, when I bought the game I wasn't expecting much from this game. The screenshots looked nice and I am a huge RPG fan. So I bought it when it was on one of those typical Valve Season Sales.This game is just great. It entertained me over 80 hours (well perhaps about 75 hours, the rest of my gameplay is menu idleing while reading guides or wiki). I saw many reviews comparing this with Skyrim, but be honest, they are very different.Soundtrack is very nice. Background music gives great atmosphere, but sadly there are a lot of soundbugs. I didn't hear any background music in the last 20 hours of gameplay. Sometimes sound of my characters battle voices and those of my weapons disappear. Only fix I managed to think about was restarting the game.The voice acting was nice. Although there are not that many voice actors, but they were doing a good job.You can develop your character in different ways. You can chose between three different skill trees, basicly that is the decision between Knight, Rogue and Sorcerer. But you can play any combination of those as well. Your skill tree will determine what weapons you will use. I played with the Rogue skill tree because I like stealthy approaches, and the dagger and faeblades you find are really nice and very fast. Great in combination with a bow for range attacks.You can make tons of side quests and task. After completing the game and both DLCs I managed to complete over 200 quests (including the main quest). Combat is very repetitive. When you know how it works, it gets very very easy and you will fight almost the same every time. I played the game on hard. The first 10 levels were hard, because of bad equipment and stupidity ;) But after that it was very easy. Maybe I died 20 times during the remaing 30 levels. Very nice was the fact, that NPCs you have to follow or are your companions don't run slower than you. They run at least as fast as you, sometimes even a little faster, but they are waiting if you get too far away. The only thing I really hated in this game was the camera. You cannot control the FOV. It adjust automatically to your current situation. Zooms out when there is an enemy far away. Gets closer if not. But sometimes this stupid camera drops below earth and all you see is dirt.Or in cutscenes you will see just a wall or a shoulder of a total different NPCsAll in all a very nice RPG. Go get it when it is on sale. Take your time doing all side quests and you will be entertained for a long time.			",1402,653,45,163,161,10,166

												This is a review that's going to make me very sad. A sad tiger is not a sight people should have to witness, but nonetheless, hear the tale of the tigers' lament. Hear the tale of the RPG that once was, and will never be. The tale of Amalur.Kingdoms of Amalur was pitched as a wide, sprawling, epic world. Written by R. A. Salvatore and artwork by Todd McFarlane, this was a world where big names came together to produce an impressive, colourful vista. One where grand battles were fought, where the history of races was told in rich tapestries and stories of lore. Where gnomes were no longer the comedy option (World of Warcraft, yes, you, stop hiding in the back there, this is you I speak to at this point!). A world where the strings of fate invisibly guided everything and everyone around them, and those who could read the weave could fortell glimpses of the future.The story revolves around the antagonist, one who has managed to unpick the very threads of fate, and the protaganist, you, similarly freed from fate, and your journey from the rags on your back (and the start which sees you unceremoniously dumped in a pile or corpses), to eventual confrontation with the evil that threatens to consume the world. The story has been told many times in many other games, but it is presented with a style and sheen that carries itself well here, the core plot quests keep a coherency and pace that maintain your interest through the rather lengthy world. Not to mention the absolute *ton* of side quests and factions you can involve yourself in, and their own stories and backgrounds, all of which are intricately details and have their own little plot twists. This is a game that prides itself on depth.... Right up until you step into it and realise that this was probably intended as an MMO. It... takes a bit of a mental adjustment to begin with, because the world, and everything in and around it, feels at first -like- an MMO made singleplayer, there's the vendors, the towns, the crafting system, in fact, so little of it feels single player tailored you'd be forgiven for asking ""Where are all the other players?"". Once you begin the combat however, that slowly fades into the background, combat in the game is intuitive, flashy, and visceral, with a wide variety of weapons, and a constant encouragement to alternate between magic and weapon attacks, this is a game that rewards variety and creative use of your toolset.Get over that initial mental bump however, and you'll quickly settle into a large, expansive game, with a wide and diverse world, which okay, will oft remind you that it does feel like an MMO minus the other players, but then equally it will take you places and on journeys that a lot of Roleplaying games have almost forgotten how to manage these days. It's a wonderful thing.This unfortunately is why I am a sad tiger. The company that made this game is now bankrupt, and the assets have been sold off and everything connected to it, scattered to the four winds. There will not be a sequel, or an MMO, or any further patches or adjustments. The final product is what you get here, with a few idiosyncracies and all. It is a flawed gem, but a gem nonetheless. If you wish to get lost in a world for a few days and embark on a properly epic journey, visiting Amalur is definitely a place to consider.			",1648,571,92,264,280,18,321

												In 25 hours of gameplay time, I cleared out 8 regions out of 30 odd total regions. I don't feel like I'm progressing at all even though I'm at level 20. Game's original design being a MMORPG shows a lot and makes the game a huge timesink.Let's proceed to the pros and cons:Pros:-Good combat with interesting skills.-Artsyle is pretty good and immersive.-Lorestones are lovely with those pretty good ballads.-Character faces, bodies and animations are pretty good when compared to the something like Skyrim, but it's a result of game's aesthetic design.-Wonderfully crafted lore by R.A Salvatore.-Unique items actually mean something and finding one of them is very rewarding again unlike Skyrim.-Skill system is intriguing and allows many versatile gameplay choices. (Although I went with full might because Amalur belongs to the Nords!)-A good variety of combos.Cons:-Towns are huge immersion breakers. They consist of three buildings and people sleeping on the inn halls. Also filler NPC's that give generic answers don't sleep at all.-There aren't enough dialogue options and having a high persuasion skill usually means better loot for the quest. (But one time, I managed to end a quest with it. NPC said ""But you had to die"" I said ""But I don't want to die"" then he went ""Oh, ok then."" that was great and hilarious.)-Too many shallow side quests with little variety. Gets very very repetitive and that's one of the major reasons I'm done playing KoA:R.-Regions are connected through narrow roads and you can't discover the sides of these roads. Instead of feeling like an open world game as it aimed, it becomes a network of regions.-No horses, no way to go through one end of the map to the other quickly. You're dependant on fast travel.-Enemies that you kill on the roads spawn back too quickly and it rather becomes a tedious task.-Not much diversity on enemy types.-Enemies do not have origins. Why Kobolds are Kobolds? Why Ettin are Ettin? Is their sole purpose of being in the game is getting killed by the player?Grand Finale:Game is good, I can't bring myself to play to the end but for these 25 hours was pretty fun and I never felt so engaged to a game since Skyrim. But seeing that I'm at 25 hours and only completed 8 regions, I thought that I should stop. This was not a decision taken by boredom, in fact never felt boredom playing this game but it seemed like the logical thing to do. If you have time and like RPG games it's a must play. Even if you don't have enough time to complete the game you should play it for the atmosphere until you feel it becomes repetitive. For this kind of experience, this game is dirt cheap.I feel like if the dev team had time, money and it wasn't built upon a failed MMO project, it could have been a great game. Unfortunately Big Huge Games bankrupted after low sales of this game, so we're not getting any kind of sequel. It's a damn shame because the world of Amalur is so immersive and has enormous potential as an universe.			",231,58,10,24,37,2,59

												It's like fable and dragonage had a childPROS Beautiful design and environments neat gear and weapon designs interesting story and lore a super vast number of side quests very cool skill combos and fight style variations very well done skill tree and class managementCONS Repetitive af with tons backtraking ending up feeling like a chore. Had to start rushing just to see what happens in the main story. Sidequests and guild quests are ending up the most boring thing. It's nice to have a huge quanity. But varietion start feeling way too poor very early. Invisible walls in an open world design. It's not too bad, but it's a bit stupid some times.It's recommended. Especially during special offers.

												You will hear many bad things about this game - That it's mediocre, that it's a singleplayer MMO, so on and so on.Well, they might not be wrong, but the good outweights the bad by the landslide.You play as a ""Fatemancer"" of sorts, in addition to your own class of choosing (Warrior, Mage, Rogue, etc)The combat is simply amazing. Satisfying. Fluid. Especially the aforementioned ""Fate"" attacks which include stunning visuals.The weapons are awesome as well, even normal weapons can be imbued with elements, not to mention some rare and awesome items like that spooky organic sword i got one time.Speaking of visuals, graphically the game is gorgeous and colorful  - especially the magic.You can also craft items and purchase housing with further upgrades.The ""MMO"" parts comes from the ""fetch quests"", but i don't dislike those. As for other quests, there are many of them, including ""Guild"" questlines.I rate the game Two E's out of Two.			",238,71,17,37,23,2,25

												Good old-school Action/RPGPROs- Huge world: it is a MMO turned Single Player, so you get huge areas and countless quest hubs- Class system allows lots and lots of different Character builds- Fast travel to avoid running too much around- Longevity: 60-70 hours needed to complete it- DLCs are worth the money (do not forget it is EA!)- Awesome actions/skills- Crafting allows a lot of customization of gearCONs- Repetitive dungeon design: after you have visited 5, you've seen them all- Recycled enemy design: same mobs in all areas- Too many sidequests: you will end up overlevelled pretty soon- Main quest is quite boring, expected better from R.A. Salvatore- Too many item drops vs. small inventory = lots of travelling to sell trash- Menu design- Too easy, even on Hard modeA word of advice: if you are looking for a RPG experience stay away from crafting. Crafting (Blacksmith + Sagecraft) allows to create EXTREMELY powerful items, which will make you Char hit with skills for hundreds of thousands of dmg, while mobs have probably 3000hp to say the most. You can easily oneshot every boss in the game too, all while having 99.9% damage reduction, making it trivial			",75,12,0,17,8,0,15

												I really enjoyed this game. It feels like it was designed for people who like RPG's, but want more involved action type combat. I would definitely recommend this game if you enjoy action RPG's and exploring new worlds. It's a shame that the studio went down the way they did, but this game I felt was definitely worth my time.Pros:CombatLootInteresting Sidequests and StoriesLeveling SystemArtController support (if you like that, I played with both, it was better with PC just because of more binds I could use)Deep fleshed out world. I really liked the Lore in this game.Lots of Quests ( I did every quest except for the ""Collect XYZ"" quests, and that took me about 60 hours.Choice (It's not as deep as some games, but you can make choices that have different outcomes in the world)Bosses (Had some interesting boss fights, including the last one, although not too difficult on normal setting)Voice Acting (I liked the voices of the characters, although your character has no voice, I prefer it this way)Cons:Character Creation/Customization (not a big deal for me personally but bare bones here)Bugs (There are some serious bugs that ruined quest lines for me. They occur rarely, but it didn't take too much away from the experience for me)Main Quest Story is OK (I enjoyed it, even the end boss is pretty fun, but the epilogue after feels short and unpolished)Can be grindy (Lots of the quests are the same, but the stories for the side quests were often interesting and kept me wanting to get to the next town/area to find new quests and solve problems)Combat (Although the combat is fun, it's easy to become over powered if you figure out ways to spam certain attacks. It's not a HUGE flaw, but the balance could be better)Voices (Although the acting is good, you hear the same voices over and over again.)All in all I would recommend if you're looking for an RPG to play while waiting for something else. I think you will be pleasantly surprised.			",50,7,1,9,7,0,7

Posted: October 4, 2014
												To sum it up: I paid 9.99 for this game,  and I felt I've gotten my money's worth, easily.  Overall Impressions: For looks and general feel - in one sentence, I'd describe it as the b**tard child of Torchlight and Skyrim.  It feels like it has borrowed something from both.  It feels like a game that was, at one point, to be grander and bigger than it ended up being; potentially interesting lore feels a bit stilted and half-told  (or, oddly sometimes OVERtold) at times, the music is occasionally good but most often forgettable.  If you've ever been really taken somewhere else by an amazing track - some of the Skyrim music, or the Nagrand themes from Warcraft, if I name two personal favourites -  you will not find that experience replicated here musically.  I found the starting area the worst as it seemed to be very limited in tracks - once I moved out into the world more, things seemed to improve.While it's less cartoon-like and lighthearted than Torchlight, it is far more static, less vibrant and fluid than Skyrim - but there are aspects to both that came to mind while playing this.Cinematics are limited, as are camera angles, and movement over the map in general - designated ""jump down spots"", inability to climb over/around objects, etc. will be obvious to you if you're the kind of person who killed mounts in Skyrim until you modded them to be invulnerable, because you're going to go over the mountain YOUR way, and that's that.In fact, you won't be on a mount at all - but in compensation, the fast travel feature is made available very early on, and the map fills up with quite a few waypoints. As a single-player game, it's MMO roots - while generally hidden - do show from time to time, if only in the vague sense of feeling like the world feels a bit -emptier- than one might expect.   There's thankfully a dearth of overly ""grindy"" quests (kill 100 of this to get 50 of that), but there's also skills that feel fairly usless (crafting gems, more on that below), and make you wonder if, had this been an MMO, had there been high-end/group content, they'd have become more beneficial.More specific comments/aspects:General gameplay - the game is stable enough, but I have found more than a handful of buggy quest issues - quests that don't complete correctly and can't be fixed without a rollback to an earlier save. Items that when used, don't spawn the map point related to them, little things like that.However, unless you're dead set on a particular item or quest, you will find levelling in this game so fast that you WILL outlevel quests and gear very easily.  Particularly if you tend to build up your fate bar quickly, for XP gains, and/or drink experience potions - it's going to fly by.Combat - for me it's PRO OR CON, depending on what you want: combat is fun - flashy, satisfying - but I definitely would not call it challenging. The visuals are entertaining, and at times funny, and while I appreciate a game that makes you AIM attacks and spells properly, I also feel you pretty much hit the ground overpowered (at least on normal).  On the upside, being able to respec and play with talent combos is a no-brainer, and only a minor investment even fairly early on in the levels.  Improvements to the character and various perks are generously offered through quest lines, challenges, discoveries, etc.Loot - You'll end up with so many epics and set pieces that you will be bored with it after a point.  However, said loot is not all it's cracked up to be (see notes below on talents).  Weapon choices are many, loot is generous, and with the freewheeling respec potential via the fateweavers, you can easily change the entire path your character is taking anytime you see fit, just to try out something cool that's dropped.Talents -  To some extent, the talents you choose can cause the loot aspect to really fall short, because if you choose to skill up blacksmithing and gemcrafting as early as I did, it only takes a few lucky salvages for components before you're going to make gear for yourself that far, far outshines the very best drops you get, the vast majority of the time, and since there's no point in the game where you can disenchant purple/epic or yellow/set items, much of that ends up in your stash, or vendored.   You can name the gear you craft, which is occasionally entertaining.Socketing gems is something they obviously intended the player to do, as beyond a certain level, socketed items drop regularly, but even there, no item that's dropped with open sockets has come close to crafted gear, since - once skilled up - you can use gems as part of the blacksmithing process. Detect hidden is surprisingly lucrative, leading to extra gold - but also stashes of loot, secret doors, and ultimately opening up items on the map that would take time to hunt down otherwise.One aspect that I DID find fun, and a bit more interesting (having played a rogue-type character in multiple games for years), is the stealth ability - without resorting to invisibility potions, you are forced - especially until you're skilled up - to pay real attention to the direction in which your target is facing, the patterns in which they move or change direction, etc. In short - it's easy to learn, easy to play, generally smooth, fun to look at, and (in a good way), easy to put down. I've no regrets about buying it on sale, and while I'm not sure it screams ""second playthrough"", I can only give it a thumbs up for a generally entertaining - if imperfect - rpg experience.I hope that's useful to someone. Recommended, yes.			",28,12,1,11,9,0,5

												Nominated for the “I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award” award because it's bloody fantastic and each year the goes by it gets pushed further and further down a particular pile of rubble called ""RPG Games"". I love RPG games, but it's kind of hard, it seems, to separate the Good from the Bad and the Ugly.This one is definitely a Good, so give it a shot already.(Yes, even if you've played 10/10 IGN AAA RPGs.)

												A Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning™ Personal Rating - ( 12/10 ) Must buy Classic!!! Great storyline, lots of quests, very very big and beautiful world to explore, great graphics !I will still continue my Journey until i achieve everything :)So another 80+ hours on 'HARD'. (Just for one achievment lol)CONS? (have any? well unfortunetly yes)Lack of Multiplayer - Game made for Multiplayer / CO-OP...but you won't find this in game menu....( [/i]SHAME ON YOU DEVS[/i]Music/Soundtrack... - Tragically, the music/soundtrack was far less polished. Maybe they ran out of funds? The sound just isn’t relevant to the rest of this great game, and doesn’t compare to the rest of the entertainment production. Tons of side-quests... - The side-quests....Yessss..Ohhhh YESSSS.....You will find tons of them in Amalur....Good? depends on how you want to go through the game, in this case, performing all the side-quests ( tons of them out there ) will make you 0verpower3d Mut4nt and the game will be just too easy and boring, even on “hard” ( Basically... you will enter the opponents as the Bee Gees in leggings ). Other way ( I think is better one ). Other way is sticking to the main tasks and the three ""main"" storylines, (House of Ballads / Scholia Arcana / Travelers)  to have some challenge from our enemies, and to enjoy the game as long as possible! You will feel pleasure slowly developing your character, and the satisfaction of gaining experience after a difficult battle... ( what else do you need )I hope that all Action RPGs will be like this one in future :)			",883,311,51,127,112,11,172

												(most of my hours in this game are on Origin, not Steam)A lot of users compare this game to Skyrim, when really it is more like a single-player mix of Torchlight II and Guild Wars 2. Tons of missions, deep crafting, combo-friendly combat, a huge game-world and genuinely interesting lore means a lot of time can be spent in Amalur. Installed size on hard drive (with all DLC): 11.6 GBReckoning is rather like a single-player MMO, if that makes any sense. Looting, crafting and leveling are the primary attractions. There is a ton of loot; putting points into the “detect hidden” skill reveals secret rooms and passageways that have even more loot. You'll want to loot as much as you can, even armor sets that you won't use – put points into blacksmithing, disassemble the armor and weapons you don't want to get the parts, and craft something truly epic. Leveling up provides new abilities, new special moves for weapons. At the end of each leveling session, you get to choose a “Fate Card” with special bonuses. Fate Cards are not class-specific, meaning you can use them to create a warrior mage who equips heavy armor, or an archer can wield heavy weapons, or a thief / rogue who also has some magic. There are dozens of hybrid “Fate Cards.” And if you're not happy with how your build has turned out, visit a Fateweaver to “Remix your Fate” and reset your build so you can level up again with your existing points.The world is huge. There are a lot of places to explore with side-missions hidden everywhere. The graphics are 2012 era DirectX 9: Colorful, bright, and occasionally low-res. The general comic-book style of the artwork hides some graphical shortcomings. And on the plus side, if you have a less-than-stellar gaming PC, the game will probably run just fine. (Back in the day, I ran it on a 1GB Radeon 6670 without issues). The soundtrack by Grant Kirkhope catches the ambiance nicely. The voice acting is generally good (though your hero is silent, a la Dragon Age Origins).Not everything is excellent, unfortunately. Combat flows well, encouraging the use of different moves. Despite the many different skills and abilities at my disposal, once I found a way to dispose of mobs, I just stuck to that, and never really tried to change up my attacks. I won't say combat is easy – if you go into an area under-leveled, you'll die fast (even with potions). But once you're comfortable in the system, combat becomes just another chore. Fetch quests are repetitive. All exploration is done on foot – no horses. The dungeons are NOT copy / pasted; there's a lot of variety here. But the missions that use the dungeon and cave levels tend to follow similar patterns. If you try to do a completionist run of Reckoning, you'll need a titanic level of patience and dedication. Inventory management, frankly, s*cks. Oh, and jumping. You can't jump, except at prescribed places (“press F to jump”).Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a great game if you love messing about in an open world while worrying about plot later. If you're looking for a go-anywhere, do-anything adventure (with the freedom to jump wherever you want), you'll probably be happier with Skyrim. Or online with friends in Guild Wars 2. Sometimes, though, a solitary, easy grind for loot is exactly what you want - and exactly what Reckoning provides.On DLC:The Weapons and Armor DLC provides three complete weapons sets that are accessible at the start of the game. While great to have, the things you craft will quickly surpass them in quality and effectiveness. The Teeth of Naros and The Legend of Dead Kel are both large additions to an already massive game. Each provides a new campaign and entirely new areas to explore. Naros in particular is a great piece of DLC. Both have a lot of content in an industry where content-laden DLC are rare. Definitely worth it to get both.Notes:An EA account is NOT required. Though the game asks for an EA login on startup, you can simply click the X in the corner to skip the login. The game will play and save normally.The company that developed Reckoning, 38 Studios, went bankrupt in 2013. The only support for the game is what you will find when trawling the forums.

												A great fantasy RPG to invest your time. It's not on the same level as Skyrim but it's still fun and worth playing.Pros:+ Great story: It's sort of a multitude of stories mashed together to create the background of the world you're playing in.+ Character freedom: Develop your character as the game proceeds with attributes from the following classes (mage, rogue, warrior) by spending points at every level.+ Lots of side quests to choose from.+ Wide selection of weapons and armor to forge and enhance.Cons:- Horrible camera angles at times especially during some scenes that leaves you wondering ""wth just happened"".

												Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is by far one of the best RPG's I have ever played. For me it's a solid 9/10, i really enjoyed the main quests and character development through out the story. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys RPG's similar to Fable. The thing that makes this game stand out from the crowd is the combat which blew me away. I still have hundreds of hours of side quests and things to do haha so there is plenty of content to go through.What makes it a 9/10+The combat is amazing +Huge variety of armour and weapons+Large amount of content+The gameplay feels fluid and smooth+No frame rate issues on my low end laptop+Bugs are rare+Amalur is huge and the scenery is amazing+So many skills and abilities +Character customisation+Animations are so badassThe reason why it's not a 10-The game becomes too easy when you have good gear-No relationships, no wife to polish your armour -Can only jump in areas with a button promt-Invisible walls			",54,4,1,8,11,0,3

												One of the best games I've ever played.I bought this during winter sale, without any expectations. Installed, started and played for about half an hour. Loved the art style and startup. Ran into an (almost) game breaking bug. Applied for a refund. Heart said to try it out again. Tried with KB/M and it worked flawlessly. Took the chance and cancelled the refund request. That my friends, was the best decision I made.This game has changed me. With engaging story (Looking at  you, Skyrim), Interesting characters and beautiful world, I was hooked. The soundtrack is really good and the world feels alive (kind of). Not a good writer so I'll keep this short. Pros:+ Really good Story+ Interesting and annoyingly good characters+ Many Boss and Mini-Boss fights+ Unique art style+ Good controls for both KB/M and Controller+ Will teach you about life (really)+ Crafting+ Multiple classes, which you can change anytime via skill reset OR merge two of them (recommended)+ Funny dialogues+ Really Easy even on Hard (Depends on you)+ Different type of environments+ Huge Open World+ So many side quests (Many are too good)+ Choice based dialogue system (doesn't affect ending though)+ Really Good DLCsCons:- Slightly un-optimized - Does have some game breaking bugs (I never encountered one)- Easy (Again depends on you)Overall, I whole heartily recommend this game. Buy the complete collection with DLC and you won't regret this. I'm sad that we won't see a sequel, but with the size of the world, we may not need it. I rank this game in my top 3 games, with Half Life 2 and STALKER.Finally, I have to say this. Better then Skyrim in many aspects. 10/10. ",1634,615,44,158,130,16,179

												What can I say about Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning?  It is an absolute and criminal shame that the company who put this game together dissolved before they could make a sequel.  The story line is decadent and entertaining, and the world has been robbed of a beautiful and engaging series by virtue of developers' bankruptcy.  Still, the only extant offering in the Kingdoms of Amalur series is definitely worth the price to play.  The game devs did not reinvent the wheel with regards to the RPG genre, but their ascendency comes from the wholly customizable class system.  Ever feel limited by the restrictive class system of other games?  Ever feel like your plate-wearing badass would also have access to sneaky, sneaky rogue tactics unavailable to your class?  Ever wonder if your mage would be just as adept at wielding a swords as at wielding magicks?  KoA allows you that opportunity and more with an imaginative and unique system that rewards your playstyle, whatever that might be, and if at anytime you regret your choice, just visit one of the many fateweavers in the game and change it all, for a token sum of coin of course.  Equally inventive are the skills, which are accessible regardless what ""class"" you've rolled.  All skills have utility: Alchemy makes potions ranging from health and mana to enchancing various types of damage done or reducing that received, blacksmithing creates armor and weaponry for every build, sagecrafting shapes gems to enhance your gear further, and those are just the tip of the iceburg.  Persuasion is decidedly worth the investment, but lockpicking is not, as only a skill point or two will carry you through the game, particularly as lockpicks are plentiful and the minigame is not difficult.  Speaking of difficulty, anyone just picking up the game would be well served to play it on the hardest difficulty setting; I was advised by a review to do so and never regretted it, as few of the encounters will shred your nerves, even on the hard.  If you want hard, go play Dark Souls.  If you want a fun take that shows the potential of what role playing games truly could be, try KoA.  This game is vast, with tons of quests and things to do in Amalur, helping the good people (or not, if you so choose).  I've spent over 200 hours in the game thus far, and there's plenty to indulge your completionist side.  Right now I'm seeking out the few remaining achievements after my first full play through.  The ending was a little lackluster, as though they ran out of time and money to finish the game properly, but the journey itself was rewarding.  Bottom line, for what it's likely to cost you to acquire this game, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a steal, but the real theft is that it's the only one of its line.			",51,4,0,15,3,0,3

												It's one of my favorite games(this review is based on base game without DLC)+ graphics+ story and lore+ fighting is a blast+ plenty of different enemies+ huge open world (nearly 100 hours and I haven't even beat the whole game or seen the whole map)+ character customization+ impressive looking weapons (especially the greatswords)+ haven't played the DLC but I hear they are good+ tons of quests (you think you've done every quest? doubt it)+/- so much to do and some people might say TOO much to do- there are a few bugs throughout the game that might hinder your progress (save often with F5)- no targeting.  there will be plenty of times where you are swinging at nothing.  not a big deal, though- the camera is wonky (try Widescreen Fixer if the camera bugs you)The biggest downside is the fact that there is little possibility for a sequel, which makes a lot of people sad :(			",99,10,0,17,2,2,6

												The very definition of a hidden gem. The premise behind this game is that it's an offline MMORPG, you wouldn't think it could work but ,boy, it does. Its story is nothing new and fetch quests abound but the lore brings everything to life. The world is interesting and every map-space is unique. The combat system is amazingly fluid. Plus, the game allows you to essentially rebuild your character mid-playthrough, thus saving the trouble of multiple playthroughs to try all the character builds. The difficulty is funny though, you can get pretty broken pretty quickly in this game. Then again, you're the chosen one after-all, why shouldn't you face-melt everything you meet? lol. If that's not your thing though, there's the YSA mod that will fix the difficulty issue, making it more fair. The 2 DLCs [Dead Kel + Naros, let's pretend the armor bundle doesn't exist] are worth getting as well, both introduce a new world-space to explore that are equally unique in their own rights. To sum up, would have been the next Skyrim if not for the existence of Skyrim.			",94,40,3,11,9,1,16

												The most awesome flawed RPG gem of all times. It could have been one of the most successful franchises ever but well... The real bad - the infamous running bug started at approx. 50h of gameplay. The good - the game is so great that I kept playing like this for 100h more. This bug won't be fixed because the original team is gone long time ago. At first, it was ruining my game experience until I got used to it. (Some claim that if you reload a previous save you could fix this movement bug but I had no luck with this). Regardless this, it's one of the best A-RPGs I played - fighting combos, superb story with little stories with catchy dialogues, gorgeous visuals, crafting, mini games, tons of loot, it has it all and it never gets boring. There was never - and it won't be - a broken game that I will play till the end, and then some. All in all, don't hesitate picking it up for a bargain price - you will at least have 50h of fun			",87,25,2,9,3,0,4

												First and foremost, this game is MASSIVE. The main questline itself is somewhat on the short side, but when you combine it with the sheer number of side stories and quests that are available, well... I think looking at the number of hours I've spent playing it speaks for itself. It's worth noting that though this is a strictly single-player game, it has a very MMO-like feel to it.Gameplay-wise, there's a LOT going on here. Firstly, you have a massive number of weapons that all offer unique styles of gameplay. Then you have a multitude of classes you can choose from, from warrior, to rogue, to mage, to any combination therof, and you can respect yourself as often as you like. One minute you can be cutting down your foes with a broadsword while hurling fireballs into their face, to sneaking up from behind and stealth-killing everyone in your path. There's so much variety and versitility offered that it's pretty much impossible to get bored. You're also offered a crafting system that is in-depth but easy to master.Story-wise, the main story is somewhat interesting but pretty generic. You play a chosen one - a hero killed from the start and brought back to life, are now unbound from fate, and has the powers of a god who can break the fates of those around them and fight against a bunch of fae who've been courrupted by demons. While the main storyline is somewhat bland, that isn't to say there isn't a lot of depth to be found.  Along the way you'll be able to take part in many optional side stories, from from becoming a member of a court of fae and learning about their culture, to unraveling the secrets of a school of magic. There's a lot of additional lore too for those who wish to dig deeper; in-game books to read, and many NPCs offer their individual thoughts and opinions on a variety of subjects. Graphics-wise, everything is beautifully rendered. Unfortunately  the world itself, while gorgeous at first, is pretty generic and gets old fast. Forests, dessert, plains, etc. Dungeons especially become visually boring and repetative. As for the audio, the voice acting is very well done and the music is very nice.If you're a fan of action RPGs and MMOs, I highly recommend this game. If you choose to pick it up, be sure to grab its DLC as well. It's just as worth it as the main game.			",399,229,2,71,34,3,18

												First time i played KOA i say to myself :""Shiiiit it looks like world of warcraft !!!""BUT- With High quality textures- Without the thousands retaaards running around- Art Design : Todd  McFarlane[en.wikipedia.org] (co-founder of image comics)- Lead Designer : Ken Rolston[en.wikipedia.org] (game design on morrowind and oblivion)- Game universe and Lore : R. A. Salvatore [en.wikipedia.org] (Forgotten Realms)Thanks Azura this game got nothin common with the mmo for rude and slow minded kids.It's a very interesting and poetic rpg with dynamic epic fights and an amazingly appealing world.Pros :+ The crafting, skill & respec systems+ The main storyline and the sidequests (no feeling like working for fedex)+ The Ancient stones spread over the world who tell you a ""faery"" tale when you activate them+ The Zelda Hommage+ It's really beautiful, colorful, not realistic at all, a bit cartoon like, well made+ A world handcrafted with love+ It's a good port and just for that it's worth to seeCons : - Music is not very diversified.- Not a lot of choices to build the face of your character.- Some weapons way too much massive, a bit manga.- It's blurry and pale without a  Sweet FX [sfx.thelazy.net]- There are Gnomes, I hate Gnomes. (one of my ex girl friend left me for a gnome)==AND THE MORE IMPORTANT FLAW OF THE GAME==- Even in high difficulty the game is cake and it turns quickly really boring. You must use YSA to fix that===>  HERE[www.dropbox.com] Don't use the standalone.exe, make your own choice to fit the game to your wishesFor example :I don't use the XP gain reduction cause it's buggy (the shortcuts are shiitty after that)I don't use the health regen and mana regen modifications neither cause it screws some spellsI don't use the gold gain reduction cause i love to be rich as a pigBUT except these buggy things it's a MUST HAVE !!!In conclusion i would say i've been totally charmed by this rpg different from the Elder Scrolls, or the Risen or even the Dragon Age...But like i said it's very appealing, it seems to be a long game and the more i play the more i fall in love.

												It's got its fair share of issues with story, difficulty, and general pacing.  I also think the level design is boring.  But Kingdoms of Amalur does the important stuff really well.  For one, fighting anything in this game is an incredible experience.  I actually want to kill things in this game.  This is a big plus, because Western RPGs with combat systems this fun are hard to come by.  I feel like a total badass fighting off hordes of monsters in real time, with real hitboxes and sword swings.  On top of that, the world building is rock solid.  I skipped through all of the dialogue and cutscenes in the beginning to get to the gameplay, thanks to the devs for giving me the option to do that.  After getting immersed in the world for a few hours and actually caring about the game world, I found myself talking to NPCs and quests givers for info, and saw that the developers actually wrote up a ton of thought-out lore and history for this game.  Props to them again, for that.  And to top it all off, there is a metric buttload of content in this game.  There are new towns, dungeons, forests, and all sorts of locales everywhere, and dozens of quests to go with each.  This game can keep you busy for a while.If you're a fan of Action RPGs or Western RPGs in general, this game is worth your time to check out.  You'll have to overlook a few big flaws, but Kingdoms of Amalur is undeniably fun and engaging.  It's a lot like The Elder Scrolls or Dragon's Dogma, if you want an easy comparison.  Those are some of my personal favorites, so this game is getting a full recommendation from me.			",83,23,0,7,3,0,6

												KoA is a very unique kind of game with an interesting story for its development. We can partially blame our boy Lincoln Chafee (failed 2016 Democratic Presidential candidate. It was his first day) for us never seeing the MMO this franchise was set to be. Anybody can Google the story, or point out the parallels between other games.PROS:- This game has a really expansive story. You can't hit the game for leaving a lot to be desired in backstory as this game was solely a test game with the higher hopes of expanding the narative into a MMO. - The Crafting system is pretty solid. I have never really done Alchemy, but Smithing and Gem Crafting is pretty slick.- The Combat is fun, engaging, and requires a small amount of skill.- I liked the talent and skill trees. Though, some might not. It reminds me of WoW back before this 3 choices every 15 levels business.- Fully Voiced (Hero Exlcuded). Ralof from Skyrim's voice actor does a lot of voices.  CONS:- If you actually pick up and do all the quests in areas, you will cap out on level just about 75% of the way through the game. Very bad level pacing.- Not enough gear sets in the game. It's basically material teired (Leather, Studded Leather, etc.), and then effects can be added through Smithing and Gems.- Glitches out the wazzou. In the House of Ballads quest line if you loot a second set of the special quest armor, one is removed at turn in; one is permanently bound to your character taking up inventory slots. Forever. My end game char has them now.- The combat IS fun, but horribly repetitive. In the case of my Finesse character its rolling and stabbing. End game I just killed everything with a bow because it required much less work. I don't really care for most of the combo moves. They typically end up setting you up to be attacked, and the damage output was hardly worth it. So I would have to count exactly how many clicks most of the time to avoid using a combo that is too slow.- With the proper time put into Smithing, your gear is insanely powerful. You hardly take damage even from Boss' mega attacks. Also smithing is obselete after you cap out 75% of the way through the main storyline... so, I hope you really dig your armor's look.- The game NEVER SEEMS TO END. I am a completionist. I like to do everything I can. But damn... its just drags on and on, and maybe this is made worse by no new gear, skills, or anything since you capped out a LONG time ago. I beat this game on sheer willpower alone, and it was a friggin' chore. They just keep giving you quests, and the end is never the end. I, seriously, had to quadruple check that the bad guy I was chasing the whole game was really, truly the end of the game.Despite the Cons to Pros, I recommend this game. Its fun, engrossing, requires quick reflexes, combat is smooth as silk. The female models are stacked (if you're into that). Most of the game's problems could be fixed with a single patch (if the devs could have afforded to keep the lights on). The glithes I ran across were mostly inventory stealers or quest related. This game copied WoW and, maybe, The Witcher/Fable. BIG TIME! This game had Garissons in the Expansion pack long before WoW added them, just saying. It's just a badass game. It IS way too long and drawn out. Especially when you can't become anymore powerful shortly after the fight with the Balor. I loved this game so much I bought it for PC, when I had previously purchased it for XBox 360. Get the game, but don't expect perfection. For a one-and-done game developer, they made a much better game than some big name companies put out everyday.			",103,9,0,19,5,0,1

												This is fr my favorite game. It's like Runescape ideas in Skyrim formatting. There is so much to do and so many different paths to take. I have a few different profiles and I have never ever seen the same thing on here twice. Sometimes I walk up on NPC's fighting on one profile, and on a different profile in the same situation nothing happens. The graphics are beautiful, the quests are inventive and unique so questing doesn't get monotonous, the gear is one of a kind, and the storylines are very easy to get in to. If this style of a game ever became an MMO and held these standards, it would make a killing.			",61,13,1,15,7,2,3

												Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is definitally a great game, it may not be up at the same standards as Skyrim, but I definitally enjoyed this game more than Skyrim (This is a personal opinion, if you disagree that is fine) I felt that this game had more get to the point missions than Skyrim, and this is why I enjoy it more than Skyrim. For me Skyrim felt like you have no purpose to just wonder around and do a few missions, but Kingdoms of Amalur had more of a feel like - Get mission -> Get lvls -> play side and main missions, this has more of a RPG feel to me (once again this is all personal opinions)This is a great game.

												WHAT FABLE 2 & 3 should have been!I started playing KOAR after modding Skyrim to death and found it quite hard to get into as the games are quite different in style. However I'm now really enjoying KOAR as it feels more like what Fable 2 and 3 should have been!!!In contrast KOAR is more fantasty orientated whereas I found Skyrim to be more bleak and brutal. There are some cool magic effects & attacks and the game works fine with Xbox 360 controller, I also downloaded a widescreen fixer and post process injector from the web  to change the default view and colour settings. Widescreen fixer works great if you dont like the default view, I stopped using the PPI as I found it simpler to adjust my tv settings to get the colour balance that I liked best. Overrall KOAR has heaps of quests, armor, weapons and different environments that all look great on a big screen. if you enjoyed the original Fable or Sudeki I think you should enjoy this.

												I'm not very much into reviewing games and such, but I feel like opening some exceptions occasionally, for games that I really enjoyed and particularly for those that I feel are under appreciated. That is the case of Kingdoms of Amalur. Played it for over 230 hours and I remember thinking a while back, around mid-game, ""this game is so awesome, have already 100+ hours played and still feels fresh!"".The gameplay is the secret. With its huge map and option to roam around or fast travel, you can dedicate yourself strictly to the quests, or you can explore and engage in combat whenever you like. And let me tell you, the combat is amazing, with its melee fluidity, mixed with magic powers and potions of all sorts and kinds, all very nicely implemented and presented.Adding to the variety, you can also dedicate yourself to blacksmithing, alchemy and crafting gems from shards to make even more powerful weapons, you can evolve your character adding points to a set of skills as you level up, like persuasion, lockpicking, detect hidden, stealth, and so on.Really, there's lots to do, it's a beautiful game, even considering the a bit outdated graphics (but still very nice), and the gameplay is top notch. Being a rather long game, you can feel tired and find it repetitive at times, especially in the dungeons. But even so, overall, it's a very enjoyable game.The story, context and background are supplied through books and lorestones placed all over Amalur, as well as through contact with the NPCs. You can read it or you can skip it. Myself, I give much importance to the setting in a game and the way the story unfolds, which must be engaging. I use Bioshock and Mass Effect as benchmarks for this. In Amalur, the story is not the most important thing. The setting is rather nice, but the story sometimes unfolds too slowly and a bit confusing. The books and lore bits are often too big and boring. So, some I read, some I didn't. But this didn't hindered me from having a great experience with this game, which I did, including enjoying the story and the lore.On the downside, like I already wrote, one can feel some repetition as the game goes, especially in the dungeons and also with the NPCs. These are very often variations of the same models. They do have different voices and behavior, which balances the look repetitiveness. Also, the boss battles that sometimes occurs are many times against more powerful variations of the NPCs and this I think could have been better, introducing a few more epic proportion battles, instead of only 2 epic bosses.Finally, you can feel overpowered very soon in the game, so, I advise playing it on hard from the beginning (with the added bonus of getting an achievement only accomplishable when starting the game on hard - doesn't work when changing difficult midgame). And even on hard, it's not a very difficult game to master.But hey, nothing is perfect, and kingdoms of Amalur, not being perfect, is a great game and well worth your time.

												I could kick myself for not getting this game when it first came out. The game is very good. Beautiful graphics, the main story has a good concept, but poorly written, music is repetitive and short. Pity what happened to the Dev company, I would have liked to see more from them.The plot is interesting, your character die and comes back to life and start changing people's fates, while being hunted by those wishing to destroy you. Combat is so satisfying, the weapons and armor is good, the leveling system is ok could have been better, alchemy system is one of the best I've seen in an rpg, voice acting is tolerable.There are factions you can join, quests to do, locks to pick, treasure to find and lore to learn. KoA is a gem of a game and a pleasure to own. 8/10			",1119,447,27,150,145,7,166

												Two things when playing this game: Stick with main and faction quests, treat sidequests / tasks as filler content to help you level. And play it on hard because that seems to be the base difficulty of the game, with normal and easy being merely watered down. It's a good RPG, with an enjoyable combat system (even without controller) and gorgious graphics but it's selling point of having TONS of quests is also what shoots it down. They're mostly copy / paste of the same concepts and feel like they'd belong in a MMO. Not suprising considering this game was going to be an MMO at first, but a shame that this is what ultimately dragged down the ratings and enjoyment of a world that seemed so full of promise. The two story DLCs are great value for your money, recommend getting those for more story and less sidequest grind.			",91,63,0,29,12,0,11

												This is one of those games that you either love or hate.  Gameplay-wise, it's quite reminiscent of the Elder Scrolls series with a Fable style feel to the graphics.  Yeah, the landscapes and denizens are remarkably clean for an agrarian based society and it's a pig to mod but there's something inherently fun about running around a huge, open landscape weilding weapons that, in many cases, are bigger than you are.As a lower level character there are plenty of loot drops to enable you to afford the healing, training and equipment that you're going to need to progress through the game and the merchants have unlimited funds to buy the plethora of weapons, armour and potions that are simply beneath you to use.  The real challenge is in levelling your character to the point where the abilities and skills you choose complement your gameplay style rather than feel like an adjunct.  The ability to visit a fateweaver and pay them to be able to reset all your skill & ability points is a plus...if you're unhappy with the skill trees you've chosen or if they're just not working for you...change 'em.  It's all about experimenting to find the style of combat (might, finesse, sorcery or a mixture of two or all three) that provides you with the most enjoyable playing experience.There are plenty of dialogue options that allow you to choose the essential nature of your character...good, evil or indifferent although the opportunites to be a really nasty Dark Lord style world destroyer are too few and far between for my liking...what's the point of making a pact with a Niskaru Lord when it doesn't give you any visible benefits other than having Warsworn mercenaries trying to kill you at every turn?The world itself is open - always a plus - and the addition of the two DLCs will allow you to run around like a headless chicken for weeks, slaughtering anything you come across that's weaker than you and getting squashed like a bug by trolls and niskaru...at least until you've got to level 20 or above at which point, you'll want to move to hard difficulty if you haven't already because it starts to get a little too easy.Side quests are plentiful and, in many cases, are more fun than the main mission.  Plenty of faction quests too, most of which are advanced tutorials in the different styles of gameplay and the careful choice of abilities & skills which is where a visit to the fateweaver to change your point allocations is a must.All in all this game is fun to play and is one you can happily drop for a couple of weeks and then come back to without having to remember how to play it again.  It's challenging enough to keep you engrossed yet not difficult enough to be frustrating and the control and combat systems are simple to understand and use.  Voice acting is good, graphics are bright, colourful and well rendered and, despite some truly ugly or stupid looking armour sets there's not really anything negative to say about this game.  Buy it, play it, enjoy it...but tackle the DLCs after you finish the main game - you'll need a higher level character to stay alive.			",19,0,0,8,1,0,4

												It took me 125 hours to complete this game (all side quests and DLCs included)! Well, that perhaps is no match for Elder Scrolls, but, still, it's a lot of content!What looks and starts as just another ARPG, soon turns into immersive and beautiful open-world experience with overwhelming number of quests. And the cartoonish style is actually very beautiful, when you give it a closer look! The variety of landscapes and details – just exploring the game's world is rewarding on its own. (Take a look at my screenshots and you'll know what I'm talking about).I believe it would be fair to say that, ""Kingdoms of Amalur"" is ""Skyrim meets Mass Effect""... just without sexy lesbian shower scenes... and without choices that actually matter. Well, about that... Choices - this aspect is actually one of the minor faults of this game. It gives the impression that you have to make moral choices that will affect your future, but (apart from few barely significant exceptions in some of the side quests) all those choices change is, whether you accept a sidequest and how the NPCs answer you. They don't affect the main storyline and don't lead to alternative endings - there are no alternative endings. On the other hand, you won't be regretting anything and wishing that you had done something differently.Especially because you can change your class (!) at any point in the game and redistribute your skills and abilities (""skills"" are boosts to your stats in this game and ""abilities"" are your class-specific skills). And, in this aspect, KoAR is rather unique. There are 3 traditional classes in this game: rogue, warrior and mage. Also, you can combine any two of them or all three of them. This system reminds me that of Mass Effect. The only difference is that your choice is not fixed in the beginning, but you specialise your character in one of the three directions with each next level.What else? Loot. There's a lot of it! But only few items are actually worth something - as always in this type of games! But, contrary to Borderlands, for example, you won't be spending as much time sorting your inventory. Just put everything you don't need to junk right away. Then you can sell it or salvage to craft new items.Crafting, exploring, potion brewing, lore stone searching (they grant stat boosts), side quests, faction quests (they grant valuable rewards in the form of cards), appearance customisation, improvement of your headquarters – there is really a lot of content in this game. And that might feel overwhelming sometimes. You just grow tired of this game, especially because at one point this game stops being challenging even on the hardest difficulty. And the enemies and battles start to feel the same. You just want to find out how everything ends. But it just doesn't. This game takes for what feels like an eternity.My suggestion is to take breaks from time to time. Thus, when you return to it, it will still feel fresh.Don't ruin the experience for yourself! Because the story is rich and interesting, the combat system is versatile, the skill trees are complex, the numerous kingdoms of Amalur are beautiful, the sidequests are unique (well, most of them), there are various factions of enemies and the game itself offers immersive fantasy adventure experience that will take you hours to complete.If only the graphics were more realistic, the enemies were more challenging towards the end and there was no level cap (=40), this would have been the perfect game for me.Nevertheless, 10 EUR well spent.My overall rating: 9/10			",139,38,1,27,5,2,24

												What a disappointment. I wanted to like this game, I really did. I read that it was a decent RPG with good game mechanics and pretty graphics. However, in my experience, the most the game could muster from me is one giant ""meh.""To start, the good points: Combat in Kingdoms of Amalur is by far it's best feature. Combat is fast, acrobatic, and exciting. Taking down mobs of enemies with a variety of weapons while dodging and firing off magic spells is an absolute highlight of this game. Controls are responsive and intuitive. Boss fights can be thrilling. The voice acting in the game is definitely above average, if not very good. The main story quest (from what I got through) seems interesting. And the game definitely looks pretty, albeit more on the cartoony side than the likes of The Witcher or Skyrim (although that's not necessarily a bad thing.) Overall, what I read initially is not untrue; this is a decent RPG, good game mechanics, and looks pretty good.Unfortunately, that's where the positives end and the disappointments begin.Most glaring is, lest you be fooled, Kingdoms of Amalur IS NOT AN OPEN WORLD ENVIRONMENT. It is a series of corridors arranged in such a way as to give the illusion of one. Resource placement within this corridored environment is lazy, with resource generating plants conveniently located periodically along the periphery of said corridors. The side quests are similarly lazy and primarily consist of fetch quests (go and kill these guys, bring me back my ring. Collect a bunch of ingredients for potions to save the town, bring them back to me.)Also, if KoA came any closer to straight ripping off elements of Skyrim and the Elder Scrolls series of games, I think we would have had a lawsuit on our hands. Equivalents of the Fighter's Guild, Mage's Guild, and Theives Guild? Check, check, and check, Strikingly similar lockpicking mechanism/mini-game? Oh, you betcha. Alchemy, Blacksmithing, and Enchanting requiring specific workstations of each? Bingo. Hidden traps represented BY BEAR TRAPS, actuated spike tiles, and trip wires which set off various nasties. Yup. (I mean, the bear traps might have been the last straw for me).KoA also suffers from trying to cram way too much weapon and item variety into the game than is necessary. The result is the player being positively overwhelmed by the sheer volume of useless crap you pick up during play. Luckily, it provides a convenient and free fast travel mechanism to travel back to nearest towns to unload your useless junk. Oh, and that reminds me, all the towns I visited were essentially carbon copies of each other, with the various crafting stations, a pub, and a couple of random houses in each.While KoA definitely has it's high points -- with combat being at the absolute top -- it relies too heavily on overused RPG tropes coupled with a very heavy ""borrowing"" of mechanics and game elements from other titles. It suffers from the developers trying to cram WAY too much content, instead of focusing on providing a smaller, truer open world environment, innovative mechanics and quests, and overall immersive experience. In the end, as pretty as the game can look at times, what the game is lacking is originality. The leads to most quests and the search for crafting materials to feel more like chores, than fun. At only 8 hours into the game, I found myself overwhelmingly bored. And it's a shame.(IF YOU DID NOT FIND MY REVIEW HELPFUL, please leave a comment as to why. I welcome the constructive feedback.)

												Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning is perhaps one of the most underestimated games on the market. From a glance it boasts nice graphics, decent amount of content and a well-crafted combat system. However, I can assure you it’s also offers a beautiful fantasy world that has completely engrossing likeable characters with tonnes of side quest (With all DLC).  I’ll admit playing with PC controls can be somewhat challenging, however the controller settings are an utter breeze. The game has a vast range of unique weaponry and armour available, which makes every task, every hidden object, and every enemy slain feel greatly more rewarding. The only complaint I have in relation to this game, is the item limit, it can be a royal pain when you’re collecting different sets to switch between. Aside from your abilities and destinies there are various skills to upgrade:  Alchemy, blacksmithing, detect hidden, dispelling, lock picking, mercantile, persuasion, sagecraft and stealth, which are upgradable from basic to master. These enable you to interact better within quests or be worse off depending on which you focus on. Persuasion can make all the difference when getting caught out in committing an offence against the town, as can lock picking as you’d probably guess why.  With the availability of the Fate Weaver it is easy to respec at any given time to get a different experience from the game which holds ones interest for longer than a one route only game. I wouldn’t go as far as to compare Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning to Skyrim, however, it’d definitely be my next choice from it. 8/10 Incredibly solid game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Before its release to Steam, I played hours upon hours of Kingdoms of Amalur for the Xbox 360, and I can tell you my experiences with this game had me loving it more and more each time I played it. KoA is a fresh take on the RPG Adventure games we're so used to playing, this one in particular giving us a very unique character that develops based upon your choices and decisions. Instead of listing the pro's and con's of this game in a bullet layered format, I'll instead give an in-depth analysis of what this game has to offer for you potential buyers!Main Story:Right off the bat, the main story line leaves you in suspense as you traverse further to figure out 'Who you really are', and 'What really happened.' I will refrain from giving out spoilers, but the entirety of the main quest line has an interesting plot, in which the character has many ways of going about, all leading up until that moment where you fulfill your goals and get your questions answered! The questline is not generic in any way, other than the fact that you find yourself broken, defeated, and lost in a world in which you have to learn, once again, about where you came from, and what it is you're meant to do. All of this becomes apparent as you meet new key characters along the way that help guide you on your path without giving you too much to lean on in the beginning of the game. That being said, delving into the questline in order to find the truth was truly captivating to me, and I enjoyed each and every quest from start to finish. Side Quests:While the side quests are always completely optional, I can't stress it enough that actually taking the time to do them is both fun and rewarding! Several factions are mapped out across The Faelands that have their own unique and interesting questlines, not to mention the incredible rewards each has to give! These Factions are not the only side quests given within the game, as there are other civilian and non-dynamic character quests that are given throughout the entire game. Some quests can be tedious, but unlike other games, these tedious quests truly do reap great rewards for the character. Not only will completing a quest leave you with a bit more gold in your pocket, or an extra item to equip, but completing these side quests will increase your relationship with other npc's, sometimes so much so that they will be willing to share a few items of their own with you. All in all, the side quests are incredibly refreshing, and add a bit more flavor to the game when you're not so interested in just following the main story line. Dungeons:This is something that I can't really express much love or hate for, as the dungeons in Kingdoms of Amalur were honestly satisfactory, for me at least. Each dungeon, while very different, had extremely generic layouts and areas that had no unique flavor setting them apart, other than perhaps the loot acquired from each of them. Don't get me wrong, the layout is beautiful and it does give you that dungeonesque feeling, but when it comes down to it, I just don't feel like they added enough diversity. Other than the aesthetics, the rewards given in each dungeon speak of their own value, as you'll never be left empty-handed for completing one. Combat system: I've finally reached my favorite aspect of the game... the combat. I absolutely love the combat to this game, possibly due to the fact that, well, its insanely unique! There are no set combos or time frames that it takes for your character to swing or attack. YOU attack when YOU want to attack, and this aspect of combat really gives you a sense of control and realism with your character. The different weapons and unique patterns of attacks offered for each type of weapon is absolutely awestriking. My first time using the chakrams and seeing how flashy and insane the moveset was really set that weapon apart from the rest. Not only do you have the ability to create your own combinations, you can tie your combination in with two different weapons, making the number of combinations unexhaustable. A staff and a sword, or a chakram and a great hammer, a wand, a greatsword, faeblades, a bow, so on and so forth! This all ties in well with the fact that you are not limited by your imagination to throw magic, or any spells in the mix. This truly gives your character a sense of value, as you are, within reason, your own, indistinguishable person. Gear/Crafting:I really enjoyed some of the gear sets in the game, and you always have that excited feeling when you pick up a piece that has better stats, and just looks plain awesome! Starting out, your gear will obviously be mediocre, but that doesn't take away the fact that these sets 'get the job done.' Each new piece of gear is unique in its own way, and when we add gem sockets and enchants to the mix, you will find an entirely different craft all together. The crafting system works in a systematic way where you'll need to acquire several pieces of equipment that have 'matching qualities' before you can create your new weapon or armor piece. Of course, this goes without saying, the better equipment you have and the higher your skill, the better your gear will be when you make that fresh new piece. Adding gems to gear in order to give your character some type of buff, whether it be increased mana, or extra burn damage, etc, is always satisfying, and lets not forget to mention... You can name a piece after you craft it. I don't know about you, but I love giving names to gear of my craft to give it that unique and one of a kind feeling. All in all, the gear in the game is not sorely lacking, but I will say that there was room for improvement on the aestheitc aspect of it, such as maybe adding more flair to a crafted piece or unique piece, but that aside, the gear in the game, as well as the crafting system, is rather balanced.Skill Tree/Perks:Could I go ON about how I love the skill tree in this game... While there are not an infinite number of talents, there sure seems to be an infinite number of ways you can build your character. With the three main skill trees, (Might, Finesse, and Sorcery) you can literally build your character any way you want. There are multiple different fate cards for each type of build, so there is never a scenario where you'll feel unrewarded for going into this tree, that tree, and the other. You will always be compensated for the way you spec, so much so that you'll recieve your own unique buff while you traverse farther down your own unique spec. The perks, too, have very rewarding qualities to them, giving you a plethora of options for how you want to build your character so they fit to your liking. Whether it be increased chance to lock pick, or finding hidden treasures with ease, all of these different perks really are rewarding in their own way. There are many other aspects of this game that can be talked about, but I believe that the true value of this games comes within the eye of the beholder, so I'll stop this review here. If you're looking for a fun, refreshing game, Kingdoms of Amalur brings the package to the table. The cartoonish graphics and unique gameplay give this game its own unique flair, and the story only becomes more exciting with the DLC content as you explore different and unique areas to the game with their own interesting storylines and rewards! I hope this basic review helps you decide whether or not you want to take a peek at KoA: Reckoning. With that being said, I wish you luck, fateless ones!			",8,0,0,2,1,0,0

												Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is something of a mixed bag. The combat system is fluid and fun, and Amalur itself can be gorgeous looking (with a little post-processing such as SweetFX). Unfortunately, the story, characters, and crafting mechanic is somewhat generic. I found myself losing steam two thirds of the way through the main quest. I am glad I finished the game, but I don’t see any compelling reason to return to finish the side quests.			",77,8,0,18,0,0,2

												I haven't played enough of the game yet but I cannot wait to write the review since this game is simply fantastic. I wish they would have created a sequel and this time fix a few of the issues that people didn't like with the original game. +MASSIVE World, especially with DLC. I cannot stress this enough.+Quests, quests, quests, quests, and even more quests. Too many quests honestly.+You can make your character look bada**. And I mean real bada**. Not from the middle or near the end, no, right from the beginning itself. You can make him/her look batshit crazy.+Complete customisation. You aren't bound by any rules. You can play your character the way you want to play him. You can even change your class midway through the game if you didn't like the class you're playing with and are too lazy to restart.-Darn repair system. This ruins it for me, although some might like how it helps keep the player looking for new gear. It gets real annoying when you have to keep repairing your armor/weapons and find new repair kits over and over again.-Scaling. The game has a really weird enemy level system. Supposing I enter an area at level 2, all enemies in that area, every single one, will be level 2 for the rest of the game. This is why it gets extremely easy in higher levels when you return to old areas. -Invisible walls. If you're going in expecting complete freedom to roam everywhere in any way you want, you will find other games more appealing than KoAR. There's always that one invisible wall that doesn't let you jump down stairs, ledges, clear open spaces etc.			",83,6,1,6,4,0,1

												Had this game back on 360 when I was a peasent. Had to buy it again because it's that good, also own the PS3 version, easily already sunk hundreds of hours in and looking to get more clocked in on PC. I like it over Skyrim honestly. Great visuals, high fantasy, great voice work, art style, world lore, not to mention how amazing and satisfying combat is. (Especially with the difficulty mod). If I could change 2 things about this game, 1: I would make it more open in sense of players can do/craft more. Just more little misc things for people to do, would have been nice but doesn't make it any less enjoyable just a personal thing. 2: Open source it, this game would have been perfect for modders and would have added (I feel) a much larger community/life span to the game. All in all, get this game. Enjoyable from beginning to end, can feel tedious at times, but that's not even a bad thing in the grand scheme of it.			",80,8,0,17,2,1,4

												This is a really tough one. I so want to love this game. It's huge, with ton's of quests, tons of loot, tons of places to explore, looks good, sounds good... but it just feels so average and generic.The outdoor areas look very much alike with just varying amounts of grass and trees, the exceptions are few. The caves, tombs and dungeons get old very quickly. Even though you get a fast travel system I have often felt like I wanted a horse. The side quests are simple and mostly boring. The world doesn't react to you at all, you don't ever change it or affect it, which is really sad for a single-player game, it often feels like an MMORPG in this regard.I kinda hoped for a Gothic game with a better combat and maybe in raw technical sense I got one, but it never managed to grab me and make me want to play it and I've given it an ample amount of chances. It just completely failed to make me ""care"" about anything at all. The world, the story, the people, my own character... I don't know why. I really want to like it, it's not exactly lacking anything major that I'd want from it, but what it delivers just doesn't feel exciting and/or fun.			",246,56,9,44,49,3,36

												This game was such a beautiful let- down. the scenery was gorgeous, the side quests were more befitting a hero than Elder- scrolls side quests (""Go slay these giant spiders."" vs. ""Hey, would you mind carrying this bag up those stairs? kthx.""). and all the classes started with unique abilities and weaponry. But about midway through the game, you start realizing how lop- sided the class options are. Stealth is nice for killing one dude, but there will always be 15 other ""hive- minded"" dudes in the area ready to swarm you. The mage is flashy and interesting, but you only get four real attack spells, and only one of those deserves constant use. To make matters worse, despite you having the ability to be the grand archmage of everything ever, you dont get access to any of the spells that enemies use. like teleportation across the battlefield, and auto- targeting tornadoes.  The only class ready to stand against anything is the might class. Anything close to you gets pulverized by your hammer (the only weapon option with a decent speed vs. damage output trade), and anything out of its short range gets yanked in by a hookshot. It is a powerful combo that breaks down targets that will always laugh off magic or stealth approaches. Now  for the ability sets. lock picking and spell breaking protected chests is a matter of probablility, so quick saving and loading makes points into that moot, same for stealing, so putting points into these is worthless. the only decent options are sagecraft and smithing to make decent gear, a point in persuasion ( to gain access to yet another probability game) and detect hidden to find better gear and more money. TL;DR- Get this game when it's 50- 75% off. Gameplay gets boring, but exploring the environments will be worth while, and it's pretty long, to boot.			",225,67,1,27,8,2,22

												Before playing KoA, I had read reviews that tried to pit it against Skyrim for some reason, an odd choice considering that the gameplay and ""feel"" are at opposite ends with both of these games. One thing you really need to ask yourself before you purchase this game is "" Do I have a lot of time to invest in another long drawn out RPG"". I asked myself that before I bought KoA and just ignored how much time I do actually have to commit. Though I havn't finished KoA and I bored of it at about the 70 hour mark, I did enjoy the exploration and the way the game felt to play. It's not exactly open world or a sandbox but there is a lot to see, lot's to explore. I found myself swapping out specs because playing the one style got tedious and my time got taken up with a lot of travell. Otherwise, I'm actually glad a bought this, I may finish it when I have more time, up to the point I've played was enjoyable, just a little burned out. If you do buy this, be prepared to commit with small amounts at a time.  ",215,40,1,35,13,0,27

												Average - with both good and poor features, showing a lack of cohesion in design. Incredibly simple Combat, Horrendous choices that do nothing in the profession system, superb voice acting completly at odds with the character appearances, laughable npc animations and a maguffin story that can be said in 4 words. This game ""boasts"" 200 hours of gameplay but doing any % of sidequests means you'll one shot most enimies on the hardest difficulty. The Main Quest is about 15-20 hours. I think considering the amount of enemy types (9) it's still strecthing it a bit long. The redeeming features are phenominal music, lovely backdrops and varied sidequests. If you like Tolkien-esque fantasy in a Fable clone, pick it up - if it's on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a fully voiced action RPG with an open world and vibrant Fable/WoW-style visuals that aim for character over realism. Combat, magic and animations are top-notch, completely decimating Skyrim, but the soundtrack, story, dungeons, atmosphere and even quests are inferior.Size and scope of the game are on an MMO scale with fast travel, a wonderful map system and a seemingly endless supply of side quests. There's no feeling of grinding but much of the content does feel like filler and, if you stray from the storyline too long, the repetitiveness and single-player MMO feeling will hit.With loot that feels like Diablo-lite, with randomized stats, set pieces and uniques to be found; skills such as lockpicking, persuasion, stealth and detect hidden, all with perks at certain points; warrior, rogue and mage ability trees a la WoW talents; and crafting systems of alchemy, gems/sockets and blacksmithing, Kingdoms of Amalur is an RPG through and through.Overall, a wonderful game if you like being set free to do your own thing but can accept the pitfalls that tend to come with open-world RPGs.

Biggest and only technical problem is the small field of view which can't really be changed.Everyone who likes an action-focussed RPG (though much more Story depth then simple Action RPGs like Diablo)  should definitely give it a go.

And don`t play it on normal difficulty settings, it`s way too easy. Certainly, miles away from the best RPG experience I had in my life, but approximately same distance away from the worst.

												Forget about the fiasco with 38 Studios and how it's not Skyrim and bluh bluh bluh you should play this game.The combat in this game is awesome, and I say this as someone who spent all of Skyrim sneak-sniping and refusing to get into melee. Mouse and keyboard works incredibly well after you get the hang of the camera, both weapon combos and dodging feels fluid and responsive, and melee combat is both satisfyingly visceral and very flexible. Wthin the three archetype skill trees and supporting ""perks""/destinies, you can pick pretty much any playstyle you want and change it up on the fly, since respecs only cost in-game gold. I've spent at least two battles killing enemies without using any spells or weapons, but instead by dash teleporting through them - and THEN I found the teleport-slash dagger critical attack that lets you enact your favorite shameful anime samurai fantasies. It's pretty great, is what I'm saying.Story-wise, Amalur is solid but not precisely innovative; you have a lot of medieval-era peasants trying to make a living but there's a big bad and a bigger bad who want to destroy the world as you know it, and you're the Special One who'll etc etc. it gets less annoying as you get deeper into the story and find that most people don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about how special you are. However, the Scottish-Roman gnomes are fun, and there's a few interesting twists in the (tons of) sidequests and main quests available. You shouldn't try to do them all, but you won't need to anyway since there's plenty of EXP to go around.Also, this game is pretty as hell. Very high fantasy. Much bloom. But pretty.

												I got this game from my girlfriend because she wanted me to try it out, I was complaining about games not meeting my standards/expectations and that I got bored of them so quickly. All I can say is that it was the right choice from her, gifting me this awesome game!Graphics might look ""outdated"" compared to many new games coming, but it has the charm that so many games lack. I continue to hop into it and not even to follow the story line - I enjoy all the things you can do, been doing so many side quests that I was in a whole completely different place than where my main story line played.I have an emotional connection with the game, which almost no game has been able to give me besides ""Jade Empire"". KoA has the same combat style as Jade Empire, really fastpaced the only difference being KoA is way more brutal. I love the sneak take downs, always different and always very rogue-like. I remember sneaking up on this enemy and actually patiently waiting for him to turn around for 5ish minutes, sneaked up right behind him and executed a sneak attack. My character covered the mouth of the enemy, stabbed him three times in the chest while pulling him back downwards, layed him softly down on the ground while crouching, slit his throat and then looked around to observe the surroundings - if her attack was noticed by the other mobs in the area. This game has so high immersion that I completely forget to check the time, it isn't the easiest when you are trying to fix your sleeping pattern, haha! Pros:- Immersive gameplay- Story rich, the story grabs a hold of you from the start and it has a high sense of importance (we all know those games trying to force you to do stuff for the ""story"" and you hate it because it is so tedious and you are not interested in it, because poorly written/executed/makes no sense/makes little sense or it is just plain stupid and boring, this game has no such thing as any of the above, the story is rich and interesting)- Your character looks badass!- Fastpaced combat, it gives satisfaction with killing blows, sneak attacks, random badassery with any other weapons than daggers for example.- Brutal combat!- Awesome cutscenes, I have watched every single one!- Good/evil choice settings (gotta love that!)- Big world - not huge, not tiny!- Unique characters/enemies, even talking to random NPCs is satisfying! Cons: - No romance almost (every RPG needs a romance option, even if you will not play it). There are like three minor options for romance and it feels like the concept is very overlooked- Spiders (not as much as a con as it is a personal problem). Imagine running freely towards any destination, then suddenly you hear a loud rumbling, your camera spans out and out comes a huge spider! While the minor cinematic goes on, spiders have surrounded you... it isn't a dealbreaker, the loud noise makes me jump everytime. That was a small list for cons, I know!			",42,4,1,5,2,0,4

												There are no other games like this.It is futile to argue whether this game is good or bad. Lets say this game is bad. What alternaive do you plan to suggest? Witcher 3? Dark Souls? Baldur's Gate? Dragon Age 3? All of these alternatives are great, and you should definitely get them, but none of them can fill the niche that KoA:R belongs to.KoA:R was the only action RPG with decent combat system before Witcher 3 came, and because Witcher 3 pretty much carves its own very specific niche, KoA:R holds its position still. KoA:R excels in one other area where almost all other games in its genre falls flat: it has a vibrant and varied art style. Unfortunately the same can't be said about its story and AI.In retrospect, if you divide the soul of RPG into four determining factors, they will be:1. Combat2. AI3. Art style4. StoryThere are few RPG games that are good at one or two of these, but none that is good at at least three of them. KoA:R is special becaue it is the only one that shines in the combo { Combat, Art style }. It also tops { Combat } alongside Witcher 3 and Shadow of Mordor. Incidentally, Witcher 3 tops { Combat, Story }.KoA:R's art style might be great, but the Big Huge Engine does not live up to its name. Zones are segmented and the cities are pretty small. The battles are also not really that big. However, the world is vibrant and has a majestic feel to it. You can see when the developers ran out of budget to keep paying Todd McFarlane because Klurikorn and Alabastra are trash, and the DLCs switch to realistic art style.There are also many minor factors like freedom of choice, crafting and potions, quality of open world, degree of role playing, etc.If you can resist comparison with Witcher 3 and Dishonored, KoA:R has some degree of freedom of choice, but it is straightforward. Potions are boring, but crafting is awesome in this game. Every item can be dismantled into its core components, so you only grind for effect drop. Dashboarding is involved, but after finishing the Gravehal Keep, you don't even need to do that.It is combat where this game excels. Magic, might, and stealth each is played in its own different way. Within each, every weapon type has its own set of awesome skills. You can also mix and match to your heart's content. My first playthrough had a magic build, with some rogue elements mixed into it. My second playthrough was with a pure rogue build, and it played like a totally different game. I am planning to have a third playthrough with a pure might build. Each of the three primary builds has its own faction, and for the sake of variety I suggest sticking to only your specific faction in each playthrough, (because the faction missions bring out the real fun of each playstyle).

												If you liked Skyrim, Fable and alike this has some elements of those like lock picking, committing crimes,massacring villages,crafting of armor,weapons, potions, and a few other things. Combat is the funnest thing, but it can be kinda repetitive, but still good, and very fluid. Its also open world, so you can explorer wherever. Story is not bad, not the best in my opinion, but not the worst, it just feels a little generic at times, it does have some interesting parts tho. Lots of side quest if your into that stuff. They have a good art style, the world looks beautiful and have a lot of interesting designs to the map, music sounds good, weapons and such look good. I haven't ran any into any bugs or crashing issues, but that might change or not, plus might crash for you, maybe not. A issue I dislike in the game is the camera, sometimes it doesn't want to zoom in when your surrounded by a million enemies. The skill system, could use a little work for how its presented. Fortunately you can reset your skills. There also a tree system for abilities, might,sorcery and finesse, which determine you're play style. You can mix up points into each one of those, or spend it all in one aspect, like in the borderlands game.Anyways, its a fun game. You have different play styles, like stealth,range, up close, magic stuff. Things might seem to start slow, but they start to pick up the speed as you progress in the game. Their a lot of story stuff if you're interested in that stuff. Most of all, the combat just fun, mainly brought it for the combat, anyways worth trying out.			",221,20,2,24,20,1,21

												I've had a bunch of fun with this game. The world is really interesting, the combat is a ton of fun, and it's beautiful. I don't think I can overstate this. There are tons of dark, grungy, washed out worlds out there. I love Skyrim, (250+ Hours and counting) but it's colors are grey, brown, and blah.  Amalur is gorgeous, colorful, vibrant, living. The combat has a decent amount of variety, and once you get in the upper levels of power, especially as a mage, you really do feel like a tiny god, stomping on those who displease you. It's also super easy to respec a character, don't like the thief powers/attacks? Respec to a warrior and aim pointy end towards other man. Not a fan of hitting things with sharp objects? Go mage and bring down the pain. I also really do enjoy the story of this game. It's got it's share of cliche bits, but overall, it really drew me in, and kept me interested. There are a few problems with this game that I have to face, even as a booster. It's pretty damn easy. Like, I normally play stuff on easy, maybe normal, and I didn't feel overly pressed when I played on hard. It's also easy to level past the game if you're a sidequest sort of person. There are a lot of quests of the MMO variety (fetch 10 wingdings, kill 10 grobnarks, etc, etc.)Overall, however, I really do recommend this; it's a blast.			",3504,1417,143,403,514,43,561

												Perhaps one of the best Medieval Fantasy RPGs I've played in a while. The graphics are amazing, almost World of Warcraft-like. Each region is stylized differently, but follows what I think is the standard MMO style, which I don't mind, but I find it quite predictable. Gameplay, wise, the combat is really fun. Being able to transition between using a gigantic hammer and the smallest daggers is something rarely used in a few video games. The monsters are fun... for a little while. After a little while, you start noticing there's only a handful of monsters... used over... and over... and over again. Soon enough you'll find them everywhere you go. You'd probably grow tired of seeing Leanashe constantly, I know I do. The Fate powers is extremely badass, I loved using it from the start. But as you get more and more powerful weapons and spells, you may realize that the Fate powers are really only used for Bosses, not really for anything else. So chances are, you'll be playing through the game with a full Fate bar most of the time, and you won't even bother to use it. Though one thing that may♥♥♥♥♥♥you off the most in the game is the out-of-nowhere cutscenes that the game just pushes on you. And in the beginning, especially with the spiders, those cutscenes will scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of you. As for the story, it's pretty decent, but it can become dull over time. When you realize you have badass powers to alter Fate, you feel (appropriately) like a badass. Having everyone tell you that throughout the story, it gets to the point where you just tune the story out instead of enjoying it. Thankfully, there is something that can save you from ultimately giving up on the game's story, and that would be sidequests. There's a TON of sidequests to do. Almost wherever you go, there's a handful of sidequests that needs to be done. Sure, some people don't like doing so many sidequests, but it gives me something to do when I grow bored of the storyline.The game does have it's bugs, and I have encountered a few that have messed up a few quests for me. I haven't gone back to them, so I'm not entirely certain there's any way for them to be fixed. There are moments in the game where sound on weapons just cuts out completely, and the only thing you can hear are the after-effects of slicing at something or casting a spell. During a cutscene, the textures/models would take a moment to render as well. The last 2 bugs weren't exactly a problem for me, but they were slightly immersion breaking.Time to review the DLC! The Teeth of Naros is the shining star of the pack. An interesting land with interesting collosae people with a beautiful Greek-themed city. The story is great, and the final boss fight was truly amazing, albeit EXTREMELY difficult earlier on. The Legend of Dead Kel was a little bit less impressive. You were forced to stay on the island until later on in the DLC, so you were stuck on that same island for a while. The monsters introduced in this DLC were actually really well done. But that's the only good thing I can say about it. The story sucked. Pretty bad. Ooh, look, you're special... again. I don't want to♥♥♥♥♥♥on the fact that the game has you play the most important role in the main story AND the DLC stories, but really they make you so many different things, it gets confusing. But, it's not as bad as having the ""You can change fate"" plot point be the main thing everywhere you go. As for the armour DLC, it just gives you some starter armour. It WILL get replaced after a short while, so it's not worth having around, unless you're having a hard time finding any armour at the start.Overall, even though this game is fairly buggy, and it does get dull after a while, I still absolutely love it, for several reasons, but the biggest one would be that they made the mages INCREDIBLY badass. In most games like Skyrim, I would oftentimes have problems playing as a mage, because I feel their attacks are incredibly underpowered. But I was truly blown away at how the Mages were designed in this game. The Mage NPCs are extremely powerful, even slightly difficult to deal with since a lot of their attacks are homing. The mage abilities that you get in-game are beautiful as well. The more you progress, the more powerful your attacks actually look, and that's the most relevant in the Chakrams. So if you haven't purchased the game, and are a fan of Medieval Fantasy RPGs, I strongly urge you to pick this game up. You'll have a ton of fun!			",939,228,42,113,85,10,84

												This game is the pure essence of ""Fantasy Action Adventure"".Set in the fairytale-style world of Amalur (obviously), you are thrown into a conflict between mortal Humans and Immortal Fae.The story isn't too inovative but neither is it boring. No one aspect of the game is truly amazing, but they all work really well together to make a solid adventure that will have you hooked for many many hours. The best way to describe it quickly would be to imagine World of Warcraft, but with single player, a more direct combat system and a more involved crafting system. There are many areas in a pre-scripted world. Some things are persistent while others respawn. It really pays to explore every nook and cranny, as the next corner could hold an interesting quest or even a dungeon.Pros:+ fast-paced combat system where your reaction times and movement matter just as much as tailoring your stats to your playstyle.+ lots of game time. I played it for 50+ hours and aren't close to the end yet.+ a good crafting system. It isn't overly complicated but still allows you to make a large array of items that you can tailor to your specific play style. (also, custom names which I personally love.)+ respeccing is possible, so you don't have to worry about building your character into a corner.+ clear separation of battle skills and crafting skills, so you never wonder ""is this going to help me kill things better?""+ Fully voiced, high quality dialogue with a diverse range of voices. This is actually really impressive because of the sheer number of characters and interactions. + Player owned realestate which can also be customized to your liking to aid you with crafting and storage.+ no DLC ads in-game, no struck content, no micro-transactions. Just buy the game and play it till you get bored.Cons:- no multiplayer whatsoever.- no mods or add-ons as far as I can tell.- pre-scripted world. Much like in most MMOs, once you explore 100% of the game once, you won't be surprised again.The game really doesn't have many negative aspects. Anything you think is bad will probably come down to personal preference. Do you want to go on a big adventure in a vast fantasy world? Then this game is definately for you!			",118,40,0,40,13,0,23

 Overview   9.5/10I know that Steam shows that I only have 2.9 hours on record in this game.  However, that is because it's my third PC playthrough.  I had bought it a while ago from some site, I can't even remember the name of the site anymore - and I played it through... Twice.  Then, I bought it on my Xbox 360 and played through it.  Then once I sold my 360 and bought a PS3, I bought this game and played through it AGAIN.  Now I have purchased it through Steam and am playing through it again for the 5th time.  I've also been willing to purchase this game 4 times, if that is any clue as to how great this game is.  I am so sad that the company closed after the release of this game.  Poor marketing, honestly, is the only reason it happened.  They released around the same time as Skyrim, which, is not the same gameplay or style of game at all, however, both are Fantasy RPGs, and Skyrim is the fifth game in a lineage of Elder Scrolls - one of the most popular Fantasy RPG series of our time.  That mixed with the fact that ""Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning"" is a very long, hard to remember name for a game - this company unfortunately fell.  Story: [/b]   This story is not just some basic action story.  Sure it has it's cheesy moments, but honestly, what game doesn't?  Also, the story in this game was written by R.A. Salvatore, arguably one of the best fantasy authors of all time, certainly one of the most renowned.  Quests: [/b]  Some quests do seem fairly tedious, however the amount of quests in this game, and the amount of work that went into creating all the quests is incredible.  Especially with the size of the world being what it is.   All of the characters have their own personality, and that is great.  I am a game designer myself, and just seeing all the work that was put into this game amazes me every time I play it.    Gameplay: [/b]  The combat in this game is unparalleled.  I have never seen a Fantasy RPG that utilizes rolling to dodge, as well as the different weights and feels of each weapon, and with essentially a ""clip"" of arrows for a bow, and magic, all able to be used interchangeably in the same battle blows my mind.  And the stealth kills with daggers and faeblades? Come on.  Those are probably the coolest execution kills I've seen in any game ever, save for maybe Shadow of Mordor.  But that game came out two years after (and as we all know, technology and games improve SO much in the course of even a single year).  I also love the way you twist fate in order to gain additional EXP from your kills.  The crafting in this game is incredible as well.  I love the way you can break down weapons and armor for their different pieces, and use those to craft (and name!) an entirely new weapon or armor piece.  I do wish that there was not as much level-scaling as there is, however.  And the camera angle in this game is horrendous.  Even though the world is giant, the camera angle makes you feel cramped for space throughout the whole game.  Aside from those two small things, this game is one of the most wonderful gaming experiences I have ever had. Pros:  Smooth CombatGreat StoryFun MagicIncredible executionsFun QuestsAmazing Crafting Cons: Bad Camera AngleLevel-Scaling (personal dislike)Overall Rating: 9.5/10 ",133,6,0,24,6,1,8

												NOTE: update after finishing the gameOk... all quests done... expect the ""endless ones"" of course!I've played this fantasy RPG game only... ONLY for over 60 hours!So... let's say it simply... this HUGE game have a TONS of quests, sidequests, grinds, monsters, items, towns, NPC, etc.Also a very simple yet effective system of abilities and skills + combo fight systems... and pretty bloody fatalities (X). You'll see!But surprisingly, the story is also pretty good. I don't want to tell too much, but... imagine... the story is starting with your death. Good one, isn't it?Another interesting thing is, that You can choose your fate in a game (well it is more like a BIG perk, but still... good!)There are only two cons:1) max level is 40... it is enough... but... I'd prefere ""endless"" mode (NG++++++, etc.)!SPOILER WARINING!2) bosses are easy if You make enough Fate potionsBut...For now, I highly recommend this game!			",130,32,1,5,7,0,8

												Now I actually played this originally on the Xbox 360, but lets make this a positive because I loved the game so much I wanted to buy it again on the PC. This game was something I bought on the used shelf at a game store, and it was a hidden gem. While there are some small things that could be altered (Ex. the camera mod), this game does things right. It's main story is fantastic, it has a slow incline of interest at the beggining, but before long it had me sucked into the univers of Amular. Now that the game is older and cheaper I would reccommend this to any rpg fantasy fan. With a unique class system, combat system, and weapons you can't go wrong!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game here is a double-edged sword really. On one hand, you have:- Some absolutely insane and breathtaking scenery- Great art style, creature designs and a lot of eye-candy- Fun and dynamic combat- Very in-depth lore- Rich character building- Non-linear(ish), massive open world with fast travelBut then on the other hand, there are some pretty annoying cons, such as:- Next to no memorable characters, and if there are any, they are hardly likable- Terrible dialogue, talking to NPC becomes a chore you'd want to avoid- Limited character creator with presets instead of sliders, chances are you'll be running into twins throughout the game- Some skills like lockpicking are utterly useless- No enemy level scalingLast thing to mention, game has quite a fairytale vibe to it, though it's still much darker than, say, Fable. It's a game that you'll either like or you won't. The game is nevertheless very much worth purchasing if you're fond of DA, Fable, Divinity, GW2, and alike.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Playthrough length of main world: 115 hours THE BAD...-Bugs-Crashes-(Beautifully) Overpowered crafting system-World barely changes through your actions.-Sound system cannot handle too many sounds in certain areas. An epic, sweeping music track starts to play in a city, only for it to suddenly be cut off by the burning of braziers. (e.g. Mel Senshir)-Stealth kinda sucks. Both ways. In the sense that you can be caught pilfering through a chest by someone who's sleeping, and in the sense that you can totally avoid being detected by someone walking right past you.THE MIXED...-It's easy, even on Hard.-Epicness of art style, environments, and story/lore is marred by technical limits and desire for smoother gameplay.-One of the few times the epic scale of the world is shown unimpeded, the pre-final stretch ended up a repetitive chore of killing numerous squads of enemies in an overly large location.-Ending is... ehhhh. Without spoiling much, it's okay, but I hate keeping secrets. At least I can tell the secret-keeper-wanter-fella to SOD OFF.THE GREAT...-Despite the limitations, the epicness of the art style and lore still shine. Mostly.-Music-Fluid combat-Easy multiclassing and stat resetting-The journey of going through the world and questing, the ADVENTURE, was really fun for me. Like someone on vacation, I had many opportunities to take a picture and just admire at how far I had come.OVERALLA good game that could have been made great with patches and fine-tuning, were it not for the demise of the company that made it.8.3/10			",101,9,0,4,6,0,5

												I've tried several times to get into this game but it just isn't happening.Pros: Looks gorgeous. Runs smoothly at (or close to) 60 FPS. Colorful, imaginative designs. You can reroll your character on the fly and try out multiple builds on one character. Combat is simple, but not awful. Reminds me of a combination of the good parts of Fable and an Elder Scrolls game. Lots of side quests and dialog options (if you want that). Fast travel AND a decent run speed make exploring not a chore.Cons: Story is incredibly bland. Yet another ""chosen one with no memories please save the world"" snooze-fest. Every quest is a fetch quest or a ""go here and activate 4 different towers and come back, thanks"" deal. Random battles, as in enemies will just appear out of nowhere and attack you. That last one would be bad, but there are a lot of enemies that can fly and cast magic, so they spend most of the time hovering just outside your attack range spaming magic blasts. The menus are a slog to get through. Lore books everywhere filled with really boring, needless notes. Some of the worst fantasy names this side of Dungeon Siege 3.If you can grab the complete edition for ~$5 and you really, really want to play another Elder Scrolls inspired game it's not a bad deal, but be warned that it is aggressivly dull underneath the pretty paintjob.

Its not the best story out there. But the lore !!!! and sidequests !!!!!The Lorestones you find in you're journhey explain what happened some time ago in the world of amalur.Giving you a little backstory to a city or location.This is one amazing gem of a game.

Every lvl up u get to choose multiple things.-The bosses, most of them are pretty fun.-Graphics, they're pretty good for a game from 2012.-Facial expressions, lmao.-(Combat)Cons:-Quests, most of them are boring, since it was meant to be an MMO, so just imagine the ""go there, get that, and get back here"" kinda quests.-Camera, some may dislike the camera angle and movement, I actually like it but u know...-Open world but not really, first of all: you cant jump, sounds like it's no problem at all but trust me, it is.

												This is a really good Fantasy RPG.The character progression, both in equipment and in skills, is very well designed, you constantly have a significant goal in sight that motivates you. One feature worth explaining is your chosen destiny card, depicted as similar to tarot cards (""The Warrior"", ""The Seer"" etc.), that do not only give you specific stat bonusses, but also help you identify with your role for the time being. I put it like this because after every level-up, you can choose a new destiny card. Those are unlocked with higher levels and perk points in one of the three classical RPG playstyles (Might, Finesse and Sorcery), and as you can respec at any time (by visitting a Fateweaver), one and the same character can be a soldier, a magician, a thief or even a hybrid class during his playthrough. As far as I know, this version of a flexible class system is unique to Kingdoms of Amalur, and I find it to be very creative.Main questline(s), faction questlines, sidequests, exploration are all written and scripted according to high standards of quality and never feel like a dull grind. Some are a bit stereotypical, some voice actors sound a little boring (e.g. the final enemy in the Warsworn questline), your dialogue options are typically quite limited - but this only takes away very little from the epicness and entertainment potential of your adventures.The world is enormous and colourful, many natural sights are real beauties. People and structures look a little too cartoonish for my taste, reminding you that this game is half a decade old - but you get used to it. Magical objects and plants glow and sparkle, which creates the vibe of a fairy tale. Immortal Faes (Elves) left ruins in the ""enchanted forest"" (that's not its name, but it feels like it) that impress by their style and their size, castles and dungeons are very spacious as well. If I am not mistaken, this world is much larger than Skyrim. The combat system is definitely better than Skyrim's. It is very fluent and tactically varied, due to dodging, parrying, swift standard attacks, special moves and abilities you learn by spending skill points (which means that your fighting technique, as opposed to mere stats, developes while levelling up). Even my heavily armoured warrior rolled and killed like a Ninja swordsman, it just felt awesome. A very small annoying thing are the constant reminders of the option to ""fateshift"" (a special killing ability), something that was OK in the tutorial, but becomes really unnecessary after you have done it a few dozen times - and it covers an important part of the screen while the combat continues. I believe that this could have been fixed very easily, but then, nothing is perfect.A weak point of this game is the lore. I  am not able to put my finger on a certain reason, but it does not appeal to me. Perhaps it is the way in which the lore is presented: ""Lorestones"" are inexplicably distributed throughout the land, and after you activate them, a part of a myth is narrated in voices that tend to be as weird as the worst of the NPC voice actors. After you activated all Lorestones in a region, you receive a stat bonus...very technical and quite unimmersive in my opinion.Nevertheless, this game was absolutely worth the full price, and now that you can have it on sale, it is definitely a must-buy. It receives a solid 8/10 from me!			",114,28,1,38,22,0,33

												This is a sprawling, epic action RPG. There are three classes to choose from, might (fighter), finesse (rogue) and sorcery (wizard). It is extremely easy to create a pure character or a hybrid. Respec'ing your character is easy and you will find yourself doing this several times, if not for anything but to be able to purchase skills from an earlier trainer. I started with a pure melee character and took him to level 36. I played around with a hybrid melee/sorcerer/rogue, but didn't have fun. In the end I settled with a powerful rogue/melee hybrid that could barrage enemies with arrows from afar and mop up with blades afterward.Combat is a mixed bag. It is essentially a click fest like many action RPGs. Even still it is rewarding. Loot is the end game and trying to find the right equipment will keep you going. Unfortunately, as with most ARPGs by the time you get a complete set of armor you have better non-set stuff. However, sometimes the bonuses gained with a full set overrides the slight decrease in protection.Side quests can be annoying. Many are of the FedEx variety. It can be extremely frustrating to move from place to place delivering goods, or killing X number of beasts to collect your reward. There is a fast travel system that allows you to move from location to location as long as you have been there on foot at least once. This does cut down on travel time, but these FedEx quests are tedious. Since this is likely the only time I will play, I finished the majority of side quests. I did get bugged out of two and couldn't complete them. And a couple others I didn't do early and never went back to finish them. The quest system is easy to navigate and helpful markers show up pointing the way to your next objective.In the end, I was finally glad to get through the game. The last levels are mobs after mobs standing in your way of the final battle. I did enjoy this game and can recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good action RPG. There isn't a lot of depth in character development, but what is here is good.			",406,92,1,48,37,3,56

												I bought the game even though I've never even heard about it. It was on sale, I like RPGs so I thought I'd give it a shot. The first thing I've noticed or rather heard were the familiar voices from other RPGs. It was great to hear Canderous Ordo from SW: Knights of the Old Republic who gave voice to Agarth. Also you can hear Cullen's voice from DA: Origins. I've figured out more names when I was playing it but I've forgotten most of them now, it was a nice surprise though.I like the open world, and man it's huge! I've played ~100h and I still haven't discovered every location. Also, each location has different environment which is good because it doesn't get boring (well maybe except caves which are all similar). The story isn't the best point in the game, the beginning is enough to get you intrigued about it but when I found out the truth I was a bit disappointed. However, a good thing was that I enjoyed every moment that led me to finishing the story. The gameplay is very good, I found it easier to play using controller, but sometimes I found it frustrating that you can only map 4 skills. However, if  you have a good feel of your character and combat it shouldn't be a big problem. Another thing that I absolutely loved about it is the possibility of mixing the skills from all trees which allows to make some interesting hybrids. It's a feature that isn't very common in RPGs. I've found some things that were frustrating for me, for example sometimes when you have a boss fight the camera behaves weirdly, and you don't see the enemy. You just have to move your character to an open space but it's annoying if it happens often. Another things is that, you have to go everywhere on foot. Yes, there is fast travel, but the areas are pretty big and sometimes I wish they've added some mounts. Sometimes it seemed to me I've spent more time walking than fighting...And, one other thing - MORE ALYN SHIR!!! I mean seriously, she was the most interesting character out of all of them and you only interact with her a few times...such a shame. Don't get me wrong, Agarth was quite cool too but...ALYN SHIR!! What can I say, I just love her voice. When it's on sale again, don't think twice about it, just buy it!Edit (June 2015): I've just started to play this game again and man, the camera really sucks. You'll die more times because of it than because of your skill, it can get really annoying.			",83,9,0,24,0,1,0

												This game rocked. The hours provided in entertainment for the $10 I paid for it (on summer sale) was the best value ever. I love the developement and crafting system, just because it was new and easy to grasp. I also loved the respec option which allows you to change up your tactics and play style. I mean, 150 hours, you want to try it all. I found that towards the end, I had not a lot of options to spec anymore. It lacked upper level diversity. But the story line was good, the combat system rocked and reminded me of a ""controller"" type consule combat than most MMO's which was refreshing. The world is gigantic and beautiful. Its very high fantasy, not dark at all and there are enough quests that there is never a lack of anything to do or seek after.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I think it's time I finally gave this gem of a game a review. Unfortunately this game didn't do well on its release because games like Mass Effect 3, and Black Ops 2 were stealing the hype of players, and Skyrim had just come out four months before - thus this game went unnoticed. 38 Studios went bankrupt shortly after the game was released completely destroying any hope for a sequel.   So, why should you buy this game?  It's definitely not an Elder Scrolls game, which is why I have enjoyed it so much. The game offers:200+ hours of gameplay. (Excluding DLC) Extremely comfortable and convenient fighting and spell casting controls. (100% Controller Compatible)Countless armor and weapons to build, collect, and upgrade.Stunning visuals and graphics and so much more!Todd McFarlane was the graphic artist on the game, which gives it a breathtaking and also somewhat cartoonish feel of the game. Each area of the game is distinctly different and absolutely beautiful, whereas with other RPGs you get the feeling you are in the same area the entire game. If you're still skeptical of purchasing, go ahead and download the demo and see for yourself. The game is more than worth its full price of $20, so if it's on sale go ahead and grab it. You won't regret it!9.5/10			",153,20,0,17,5,0,3

												Possibly one of the greastest RPGs I've played but not for the story reason.The game itself is very fluid, everything feels so casual yet serious at the sametime, it's very easy to pick up and put down and comeback to it later and still get a great experiance if you like games that are a bit grindy at times but if you enjoy lots of quests and items then you'd love this game. Seriously there is so much to do.The areas that the game introduces I think are very for lack of a better word: Pretty, it's not like jaw dropping but it's very pleasing to the eye at least and fits in nicely with the games setting. Combat is very enjoyable, you can build whatever class you want to fit your combat playstyle and it's fairly easy to change it again if you don't like it, each class you build  gain a set of bonuses too which can affect the way you dodge along with certain stats too. there are also plenty of intreasting weapon types to get to grips with as well. I think it really offers a lot on the ways of customization one of it's high points to be sure! However there are some downsides The main story itself feels a bit... forced. I'm sure a lot of people enjoyed it but me it just felt... thrusted onto me. I really didn't like the main enemy much although I really enjoyed the concept of it all! it just felt... rushed.  I think it really comes down to taste on that one and it certainly wasn't mine. Another thing to consider is that this game uses a EA account to log in and play! I've had a bit of trouble with it before not accepting my email before for no reason to the point I had to go to the EA Origin support to correct this. (Kingdom Of Amalur Support is done through Origin support!!) thankfully it was corrected and I gotta admit the Origin support team were amazing. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TL;DR: It's an alright game if you're just looking for something to scratch a third-person action itch for twenty hours or so, but there's really nothing that makes it stand out as anything special.Combat itself is entertaining enough, but there's absolutely no depth to it - you have one basic attack per weapon type that can be chained together to a limited extent, and a couple of active abilities that scale so terribly you'll hardly bother using them. And since unlocking additional weapon moves is locked in to progress down the ability trees, you spend half the game without access to the more varied attacks, meaning that most of the time you'll just be hitting your attack button and blocking/dodging occasionally.The combat balance is almost non-existent, enemies are almost universally completely trivial other than the occasional one who is an annoying damage sponge and does hilariously disproportionate damage, and there's only about a dozen different enemies who are palette swapped and recycled throughout the course of the game. The most challenging part of the combat is dealing with the abysmal camera, which has a mind of its own and loves to zoom right in on you when you're surrounded by enemies, only stopping to clip through the scenery and get stuck under the floor occasionally.There's a variety of non-combat skills to choose from (lockpicking, stealth, persuasion and so on) which are generally either absolutely bloody useless, or hilariously overpowered. Depending on which ones you choose you can end up completely trivialising the game without even trying, but with a little care you can max out almost all of the skills anyway which makes any sense of choice completely redundant.The ability trees are probably the highlight of the game, there's a lot of different abilities to choose from, and thankfully you can respec your character at any time to try different things out. Depending on how you want to play, you can either go deep into one of the trees (magic, might, or finesse, which broadly correspond to the standard mage/warrior/rogue archetypes) or split your points across two or even all three trees. Putting enough points into one tree or a combination of trees unlocks ""destinies"" which give you added stats and bonus abilities and can make different ability builds feel very different from each other. Ultimately, however, it's still limited by the shallow nature of the combat system, and however you build your character you'll inevitably end up spamming the same basic attacks over and over again.The real issue is with the pacing of the game. Every single town you come across is chock full of completely forgettable NPCs who will bury you up to your eyeballs in fetch quests and kill quests which give no real rewards but make you slog all over the place anyway. Either you try and do everything out of an obsessive sense of completionism, or you get bored of that by the second or third town, rush through the main quests, and realise there's really not that much game under all that padding. There are half a dozen factions with their own sidequest chains that have a bit more structure to them, but none of them really add much to the game, and aside from some minor stat boosts it makes absolutely no difference to anything whether you do them or not.Overall it's a thoroughly mediocre experience through and through, which never manages to be amazingly good or offensively bad. If you like third-person action RPG games it ticks pretty much all of the boxes, it does everything more or less adequately without ever really impressing, it all looks nice enough and there's a whole bunch of lore if you can be bothered to pay attention to it. Pick it up in a sale and it'll give you a good thirty hours or so of moderate entertainment, but it's a mostly unremarkable experience with next to no replay value.			",265,77,6,50,28,1,42

												One of the most underrated games of all time. It has all the great elements of a great Action RPG.First really colorful and smooth graphics (which are designed by Todd McFarlane, creator of Spawn). World is really beautiful, characters and enemies are well animated. Graphics are well-combined with the action. You feel like you are in a feary tale. It has a big world with lots of exploring to do. Various things to collect, many side quest to complete. So world never gets boring. Different kinds of enemies, also each town has different touches. RPG elements are satisfying and not too complicated to give you a headache. There are lots of combinations you can do with your character. Weapons and armors are fun and nice to look at. Crafting is easy to understand and your options are really wide. Especially naming your weapons are fun and makes you feel like a real hero. Combat system is brilliant, which takes you in to action. What are the cons? Well main story is not the greatest. Game is not that hard (it is not a con for me but seems like it is for the most people :) ). There are not mounts so travelling gets a little boring after awhile. In the end; if you are looking for a great, rich world with colorful enemies, cool action with great graphics, this game is for you. It is basicly a great MMORPG but single player (just as I like). It is a shame developer bankrupted. Wish they could make a sequel..			",594,255,29,86,76,11,111

												Important HINT: Use widescreenfixer(google it) to fix the camera for this game, set FOV to 60-70, this will greatly improve your experience.This game is really good, but you should play it only on hard difficulty. Really underrated game, on par with skyrim but better combat. In skyrim I play an archer or an mage and get bored pretty quickly because I just spam on spell or just shoot arrows, but here I get to combo with one weapon, combo with the second weapon, throw some spells, retreat if I get surrounded - an engaging combat system. And the loot is way better than Skyrim.Pros:- The world: Variety in landscapes and cities( Compare that to the landscape and cities of skyrim: It's winter, and that's all  >_> )- Fluid combat system.- Quests: Some of them are good.Cons:- Quests: There are to many. A lot of them boring. If someone says ""I just need reagents for my potions"" - skip it. Accept only quests that sound interesting.- Difficulty: It's to easy. The game should be played only on hard. If an area gets to easy - move on.			",41,2,1,4,2,0,5

												Kingdoms of Amalur:  Reckoning  is a western rpg, meaning when you get out of the tutorial area, the game goes ""okay, the main plot is over there, sidequests are over here... go nuts.""Overall, the game starts out with you dying, and you're brought back by the Well of Souls, an experimental form of resurrection.  So far, you're the only success.  You have no knowledge of your past life, and you seem to be unbound from the threads of Fate, meaning all your actions will have unknown effects on everyone else, for good or ill.  People destined to fail may succeed, those who were supposed to live may die, etc.The game has a fair number of good points for it - you get a good range of emotions from quests and character dialog; even minor characters have been fleshed out and given personality.  The combat system is fairly simple but engaging, so it doesn't take too long to learn, but for the most part remains interesting throughout the game.  Most enemies who die in motion will drop a treasure bag, so if the body falls off the edge of a cliff or becomes inaccessible, you can still get the loot.  There are a number of quests which your decisions will actually have an overall effect on the area, as well.  More than once, someone you're sent after will go ""uh hey, I have no beef with you, just those guys.  How about you leave me alone?"" and you can actually work for them instead, or leave them alone.  Most of the escort quests aren't too much of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ either.  The graphics are quite nice as well; the game is very beautiful, and the character models are done well.The game definitely has its flaws, however.  A number of fluff items are tagged as essential, meaning if you pick them up, you cannot get rid of them or even leave them in your stash.  A number of quest items also remain after their use is expended, making them clog up your inventory list (or in rare cases, take up actual carrying space ).  There's no way to drop quests, and some quests are repeatable, so you'll always have their markers on your map after you've stopped caring about it.  The questflow is a bit odd as well - one branch of the main questline, and all of the faction questlines (along with a fair number of regular quests) point you to a city called Rathir fairly early (a place which marked somewhere around two-thirds to three-quarters of the game through for me), while only the other branch of the main questline went to an area called Detyre, which is much lower level than Rathir.  This wouldn't be as much of a problem is you received the Detyre quest first, but you receive it the same time as the one pointing you to Rathir, and if you've been working on any of the faction quests, you're going to be getting a huge push to go there as well.  The crafting and skill system could have used some more work as well; the lockpicking is a joke as most of the time you don't even need to move the pick, money becomes a nonissue quickly, making mercantile pointless; sagecrafting, alchemy, and blacksmithing all feel kinda useless until you max out their points.  Also, after a certain point in the game, all of the health and mana potions seem to drop back to lesser for some reason, even though the others are at the correct level... until even later in the game, when any non-health or mana potion drops are all just greater damaging.Sadly, given what... happened to the company, most of the bugs will never be patched, and no sequels will be made, which is a shame 'cause despite its flaws it really is a good game.  It's definitely worth $20, and any sale price it goes to is an absolute steal.			",190,39,1,41,10,3,17

Posted: June 28, 2014
												Kingdoms of Amalur confuses me.It is a game I couldn't imagine *anyone* asking for. Not in 2012, anyway, it is not a game to enter the Dragon Age and Skyrim league: Its art design is tepid and barely par for course, the story is not really that good, the UI is a consolized mess, there is no stat sheet (!!!), mod support is ZERO, there is very few skills and combat can be overly easy at times.Now, with that out of the way, this is one of the best action RPGs I've ever played, and one I've certainly played way, way past the point where I should have stopped. The best comparison I could draw with a similar game would be Fable, really, since there's a lot of elements in common with it: Quick, flashy combat, three skilltrees you can invest points in (finesse, might, sorcery), two weapons you can switch between on the fly, a few magic spells (2, until a bit further on), you'll be on your own most of the time, and combat is strictly real time. The only part the game looks a bit more developed is on the skills category, where you can find several ways to improve your adventuring and crafting abilities. The greatest achievement of this game over Fable however, is that while Fable lost itself dillydallying over customization and tattoos and farting in the face of villagers, Kingdoms of Amalur disregards all that in favor of an incredibly tight gameplay and a very flexible, if not perfect, skill tree and progression, which provides an open-ended freeform progression to the player while at the same time opening new abilities and overall feeling way meatier than Skyrim's, whose progression was more of a polite indicator that you were getting better at shooting with a bow by way of shooting more with a bow.Now, this review will be based on my 50-odd ingame hours so far. I have played with a ranged/daggers rogue complemented with some magic spells and Might talents. As you can see, I'm a kinda indecisive player, and chosen a class that's been historically looked down upon on RPGs. One, or both of those choices would have made it very difficult for me in other games: being spread too thin in Skyrim, or playing an archer on Dragon Age would make things exceedingly difficult for me. Not with KoA. There is a class that favors all-rounding. Specializing in bows doesn't mean you can't put points in swords. Or magic. And if you choose straight combat, you can utterly annihilate anything with basic combat. You can respec a pretty good number of times, too, and clever players will be able to squeeze every profession in order to get the most of them and the best equipment. But I must admit, reaching that conclusion required a bit of patience from me. The game starts very insipid and generic, and as I said, none of the first impressions I got was really that enticing, but if one can look past that, beneath the apparent simplicity and half-assedness there is an incredibly strong and extense base material: graphics are more than competent, the soundtrack is perfectly functional with moments of greatness, quests are pretty interesting if you decide to listen to them and finally, at the center of it all, the delicious, chocolatey core of it and its main driving force for me: the gameplay, and specifically, the combat.Combat is fast and flowing, camera never gets in the way and animations and attacks are very well done. All abilities have a place on it, and a lot of approaches are viable. They might say it's a game designed with a controller in mind, but I've found the keyboard layout extremely confortable (unlike in, say, Devil May Cry), and since it's way more actiony and mobile than other games', it is also extremely satisfying: even if you are decimating groups of wolves in 5 seconds flat, you'll feel like a badass doing so instead of getting bored because it's too easy. Yes, my character has 4 active offensive skills and 2 sustained ones, but I can kick so much♥♥♥♥♥in so many different ways between them and my ultra-powerful handcrafted equipment that it never feels old or boring. And besides, it's better to never let your guard down: it's as easy to lose half your life as leaving your guard down for a moment.To sum it up, if you are a fan of exploring places and killing monsters I'm not just going to ask you to buy it, but to get all its DLC (especially on sale) and to be a bit patient with it. Empty your mind, shed your preconceptions and have a bit of fun with it, start doing the first missions, you don't even need to pay a lot of attention to it. Play the game for a bit, and you most assuredly will get a satisfying experience out of it. If you ever got excited about Fable, or if you are in the mood for having a good time whacking critters over the head with weapons of incredible power, pick it up without a doubt.8.5/10			",205,38,3,25,42,2,16

												This is a really well-done game.  I never got into Oblivion or Skyrim, because they were just too big and chaotic for me.  I happily sank 100 hours into this game because the leveling and quest systems are very intuitive.  The graphics are pretty (like a very nice World of Warcraft) and the story was intriguing enough.  The combat was the best part, though.  I never felt like I was flailing around, I felt like something of a beast all the way from level 1.			",171,31,1,28,12,1,50

												I wanted to love it, I really did but it's just so boring. It's not all bad though the game is very pretty and ran very well on my machine. The combat is good, there's better combat out there it's not compelling enough to be entertaining more than a few hours. This is where the bad starts to come in. The plot was very bland and unremarkable for such a well crafted world they should have had a much more compelling plot but they didn't manage to make me care in 7 or so hours and at that point I am never going to care. The never ending fetch quests got boring very quickly, it helps move you along to new locations but it all starts to feel stale after awhile. I feel like there is some promise here and maybe when the franchise is sold to another company they can pare away all of the unnecessary nonsense, but for now there are better rpg experiences out there that you should consider way before this one. Overall I would not recommend this.Rating: 2/5 Stars			",102,19,1,16,6,0,20

												It's like Elder Scrolls and Fable got together, and had a baby. And that baby was a far better version of WoW (which I realize that at this point that's not really saying much, because in this day and age, pretty much ANYTHING is better than WoW. But still, I think the majority of us here can agree, this game is freaking kick-@$$).I've somewhat heard this game floating around here and there for sometime now, but never really paid much attention to it, till I watched an episode of ""Outside Xbox"" on YouTube, and hear one of the reviewers emphasized this to be one of her most favorite games. So I figured, well, what the h3ll, let's check this out, it looks pretty decent, and it's got an overall great rating mark. Happy to say, it did not disappoint. I like how it's not so easy as many open world rpg's have sadly gotten for some reason (yes I'm aware that you can alternate the difficulty settings, but still) it's pretty wide and versatile, and the occasional challenging areas are always welcome (i like to feel I've actually earned my level. I know, weird, right?). Honestly, and I know not many are going to agree, but I really don't mind the grinding. A lot of games out there they have a tedious grind play, but not many give much incentive to do so (slow LvL'ing, small cash drops, constant sh!t loot, etc) but this game, while yes does have some of the drawbacks (which, of course are actually pretty necessary, if you really think about it), those are few and fair between. Can't tell ya how much crap loot I got, and how much more good stuff I found or nabbed in kills as well. I like the combat system, there's a lot of action in it if you work it right, and thankfully, I actually found it easy to get used to and conduct it pretty good.  And the stealth mechanics, any mmo, rpg, open world that has stealth mechanics (good ones to boot) is always on a one-up in my book. I like to kick @$$ as much as the next player does, but nothing beats a shiving the h3ll out of some unsuspecting jackhole who thinks their sh!t don't stink 😉 . I definitely recommend this game.  I thought it was fun,			",149,40,1,21,2,0,2

												Essentially a single-player RPG with the contents of a MMO-rpg (expect the social aspect)Some of the games artwork can at times be appealing, but personally I prefer a somewhat more toned down and realistic style. In this game, the characters have overly sized hands and weapons etc all showered with all the brightest colours the designers could think of.The game consist of a few faction quest lines, which at times can be interesting, but all too often quest are ""go to certain point, fetch/kill, and return). Real choicemaking is non-existent.The main story line is bland and generic, even with the ""10 000 years"" of background history the develpoers brag about. Magic elves, technical dwarfes, in-between humans... .  The lack of good voiceacting only contributes to the game's inability to immerse, with probably as few as 10 voice-actors trying to the best of their ability to voice all characters in the game.The combat-system is quite nice. Quite easy, but a lot of ways for the player to adapt underway to the way they want to play. And unlike more classic RPGs all character developments can be changed for a small fee, so that the player don't have to think ahead. Nice, for some... . Almost all ingame quest-rewards and looting is scaled it seems, so the player seldom experience any sense of joy or positive surprise when overcoming obstacles. Many enemies are scaled too it seems.Personally I had to stop playing this game after encountering a game-breaking bug (Her righteous fury-quest), of which there is no official fix to 4 years after release (due to the developers bankruptcy, I guess). Therefore I could not fully explore the main idea of this game - fate. I find the idea of fate troubling on a logical level, and the game as far as I played it, did only contribute to this with all its logical fallacies.Nice enough game if you are looking for mind-numbing, button-mashing action-rpg, with little need for investment on the player's part. Stay clear (even on sale), if you are looking for immersion, challenge and a sense of accomplishment. This game will suck the marrow out of your bones if you are a true RPG fan.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pretty fun game. I bought it because someone told me it has a massive game world and is fun to play - both of those things are true but the game world is split into pathways, so not quite as open as you'd think. A lot of the areas in the game just feel like hubs with different strands and pathways leading out into other hub areas. It's pretty weak to be honest and not a patch on something like Skyrim which feels like a vast, breathing world. The world here is dull, lifeless, populated by NPC's that are only really there to serve you. A shame, as the visual look of the environment is really lovely, but because of the design of the paths you never really get to appreciate the vast cliffs or forrests or deserts or anything. The game boasts a metric tonne of quests, which is good, but really this just lends itself to feeling even more lifeless as it just feels like NPC's are kinda waiting around to have a chat with you about the rats in their house. Most quests are a bit of a waste of time and only the main quest line has anything worth paying attention to. I just skipped past most quest dialogue, sadly.The combat is really fun. It operates on a combo/button combination basis and I thought it was a blast. Levelling up makes you feel genunely powerful as levelling up your different powers adds visual effects to your attacks and even special moves - it sounds gimmicky when I describe it to you here but somehow it kinda works. I had a pure mage and managed to level her to the point where I felt pretty godly. A lot of RPG's these days miss this feeling of superiority so it's nice to see a modern action RPG do this again.I guess I really enjoyed the game - I did play it for 15 hours after all but also, it kinda felt more like a 3rd person Torchlight than anything close to Skyrim or any other RPG's you like. But to be fair I just thought it was quite mediocre in places. If there was a ""meh"" rating i'd put that but i guess a thumbs up will have to do.			",448,85,2,50,21,1,48

Plot Summary: Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is an open-world, action RPG set in a fantasy world controlled by fate and destiny.  When you first begin the game you are...dead.  But a mysterious object known as the Well of Souls brings you back to life.  When you return to the land of the living, you find yourself on a quest to discover who you are and what your destiny is.  Want to know the best part?  Unlike the complacent citizens of Amalur, you have no destiny.  As soon as you finish the tutorial/intro, you are free to explore the open world of Amalur as you please.Combat: One of Kingdoms of Amalur's strongest points is its combat system.  It is always a pleasing experience to incinerate a spider with your flaming staff or slaughter marauding bandits by impaling them on magical spikes.  Animations are very well-done and flow very smoothly.  The weapons that you can find in Amalur, while interesting, are not necessarily revolutionary.  Many times you will come across the same kind of weapons, the only difference being the perks and damage (i.e. Smoldering Longsword/Freezing Longsword/Longsword of Enhanced Sharpness).  While each weapon has its appropriate uses and does come in handy in different circumstances, the variety is somewhat lacking.Graphics: Kingdoms of Amalur has a bright, fantasy feel to it giving it a very World of Warcraft type look.  While many locations are beautiful and awe-inspiring, there are certain places that have a dull, boring look that I don't believe the developers intended.  Also, Amalur is a console port to PC, thus, many of the settings have been tweaked in order to optimize for console performance.  This means that many of the settings which could be improved on the PC (such as the foreshortened view distance) remain untouched with no way to make them look better.  However, as it is, I get a stable 60 FPS in pretty much every area with only rare spikes when loading large locations.  Overall, Amalur is quite the looker and you will not be disappointed with the atmosphere or the artistic style of the game.Storyline: The world of Amalur is vast and has many varied locations, therefore you can expect to meet many interesting, quest-giving NPCs.  From monks to a fisherman looking for his ""nymph"" fiancé, the variety in NPCs is incredible and I found myself too occupied by side-quests to really focus on the main story.  There are simply hours of quests to complete, each one unique and with its own purpose.  DISCLAIMER: If you do not like side-quests or non-linear storylines, then this game is NOT for you.Sound: Amalur has an amazing orchestral soundtrack from upbeat combat themes to serene forest ambients to eerie dungeon music.  The music really adds to the immersion and adds to the mood of each scene.  NPC voice acting is also very well done and varied enough that I haven't found any duplicate lines in my eight hours of play so far.  The only repetitive voice-overs I have heard are the town guards which can be tiresome and annoying with their generic greetings (I'm looking at you, Skyrim >_>).Conclusion: Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a masterpiece and I would recommend it whole-heartedly to you.  With 10 hours into the game so far, I am completely impressed and this game greatly exceeded my expectations (which weren't very high with the EA logo).  Kudos to the devs for making such a great game.			",197,31,1,17,8,3,17

												Let me start with my minor gripes with the game, just to get them out of the way. If they ever remake this game or create a 2nd one, they need to clean up the loot system a bit and add less, but stronger dialogue. That being said...Everything about this game is pretty damn good. The graphics are solid and unique, enemy AI is responsive, and the enemies themselves are also a lot of fun to kill. There are a variety of character builds, and the farther you go into the game, you can either specialize deeper or become a hybrid (personally went warrior-mage, you get a blink teleport). The story is interesting, with the meat of it coming from the characters around you rather than the storyline itself. The DLC is pretty solid and worth it if you really enjoyed the game, and would like to play more. The main selling point of this game that I have left for last is just how humongous the game world is. There are around 4 or 5 continents if I remember, each with up to 15 or so subzones, with different environments, quests, etc. It is reminiscent of WoW in the way that they created the map (in a very good way). One could say this game took elements from many different games and combined them, to which I would agree. But this is not a negative thing... the end result is that this game really doesn't have a weakness. It definitely has replay value (though I passed on that, too many games to still play...) For $19... cmon, you really can't go wrong with this one  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												OLD REVIEW WAS A THUMBS DOWNIn one word""Convoluted""NEW REVIEW BELOWOk i recomend this game based mainly on the incredible length and number of quests, decent storylines and dlc. But before you grab it and get bombarded with so many skills and abilites there are some things you should know.First your skills, more then half are worthless and should be ignored till you have an excess to drop your endgame poitns into.IGNORE Lockpicking, mercantile, and stealth.The Most important skill from the start is the FIND HIDDEN skill, get that to 5. Dispell is the next skill, get that to 6 or higher, dispelling is the hardest thing about opening magicaly locked chests.Persuasion is a mixed bag, it won't change any major storylines, but it can lead to a few extra rewards. It's not game breaking,CRAFTING COMES LASTCrafting won't make a♥♥♥♥♥♥of difference till the very end end end of the game, the gear you find will be better until the very end,Sage Crafting and Blacksmityh go hand in hand. SageCrafting can get to 6 or 8Alhemy can realy be ingored, up to the user but it really can be. you'll be so rich you can buy the potions you need easily,  and plenty drop.CLASSES, Ask yourself, do you want to blaze through the game or slowly go through the game?Mages are FAST DEMOLITIOSHERS, WARRIORS are unkillable slow dps, you have to TRY to die as a warrior. Stealth seems nice but it's so slow you often ignore stealth kills and just go into combat, also the finesse/stea;th tree is majorly focused on bows.You can mix and match any 2 or 3 trees for hybrid classes, but it keeps you from getting the top tier abilities in each.Suggestion, don't make your first guy a warrior, don't try to craft till your lvl 25+ Get your Find Hidden to 5 ASAPIf you don't follow those basic suggestions this game is going to be tedious and so slow in the first 8 hours you'll hate it like I first did. i went to gamefaqs and read some guides to learn what was crap and what wasn't.7.5/10Better then most RPG's LOTS of play time, many ways to play, ability to fully espec into something else entirely is great, the DLC is super long. Adds 10-20 hours each on top of a 35-50 hour game. If you're a lore reader (which I am no) expec to drop 100+hours for a full completion			",175,32,5,35,10,0,20

												Kingdoms of Amalur begins with an appealing, even charming veneer that quickly and dramatically tarnishes. At its best, it's a generic, ""safe"" fantasy game more reminisicent of an MMO than a single player WRPG. -------------------------------------------Combat is broken down into the typical RPG trio of Warrior (Might), Rogue (Finesses), and Mage (Sorcery), or a Jack of All Trades, with the option to respec whenever you want, as often as you want. From the beginning to the end, Sorcery goes from significantly stronger to hilariously overpowered, and the classes ultimately play the same, the only difference being in what particle effects you throw at the enemy.The game plays more like an MMO than a traditional single player RPG. You drift from zone to zone, awaiting the inevitable explosion of yellow exclamation points, and there are indeed many. Too many, as a matter of fact. While one can argue that this adds more gampeplay time, it's more padding than lengthening. There's no substance to any of them, and they all play out essentially the same.A random loot system adds another serious deficit. Fighting your way to the bottom of an ancient ruin, behind a hidden door you may find a few mushrooms and a healing potion, while looting a random household rewards you with the ancient Deathaxe of MurderLord. It's worth noting that this randomization applies to the Blacksmithing system too, in which you salvage items for parts (Which are also completely randomzied. Epic weapons are as likely to give you worthless parts as junk weapons)to craft new ones. In theory you should be able to create weapons better than what you'd find, but you'll more likely than not find trash parts, and anything you do craft will be beaten by something you find on the side of the road.There's little to say about the system itself. It's a very simple click-based, skill-hotbar system of combat. It's not functionally bad, it's just not very interesting, and lacks any sort of depth.The game's Inventory system has to be one of the worst i've ever seen. Although there are attempts to provide organization, they are token. You are unable to sort your list-based inventory, which seems to organize itself completely at random. Items sharing the same set name may be dozens of slots away from each other. Also of note is a serious problem with many, many quest items that never lose their flagging, leaving them trapped in your inventory for the entire game. As they still take up space, this can be a serious issue. By the end of the game, over 50 of the 110 items in my inventory were quest flagged and unremoveable. In terms of art and sound direction, again they hit every switch to be as generic and forgettable as possible, cycling through the usual array of fantasy zones and unenergetic voice acting.The game is rife with bugs and glitches, some of which can be gamebreaking, and many of which will impact your gaming experience in other ways, such as the above mentioned Inventory issue.-----------------------------------------------------------------------If I had to sum up Amalur in 5 words, I'd only need to give you two. ""Generic. Pass.""			",97,32,1,8,6,1,10

												I'd recomend this game to anyone who likes open world RPG's and the freedom that comes with them. The strong points of this game is the amount of content it has to offer from a large selection of non-story related quests, an enormous world to experience and the huge amount of explorable dungeon like areas on offer.The story for this game is good enough to keep you interested in the main plot, the art style and level of detail is quite lovely and the character customisation is also quite expansive from your standard crafting of equipment, enchants, potions and more to the actual skill system itself which is quite unique in the way it goes about it with fate cards. While the game does not allow you to obtain every skill and maximise it like Skyrim it does allow you to still build a unique character mixing melee/magic/ranged and stealth in interesting ways.There is also a variety of interesting weapons available allowing you to have 2 sets equipped at all times allowing for you to adapt to certain combat needs.The downsides of this game are that the sidequests can feel repetitive if you don't take a break from them time to time (or at least mix it up by doing different types) and the crafting can make this game feel to easy if you focus on making overpowered gear from the start.For the price i'd recomend it, especially the DLC that introduces some interesting features/story to th game.

												Try the (rather generous) demo. Get out of the intro and go explore the region, do some quests, try out the combat with whatever weapons and powers look good. If you can foresee enjoying the gameplay and writing on offer for the next hundred hours or so (if you're completely nuts and insist on doing every quest you find, like me), then go ahead and grab it, at least when it's on sale. For the sale price, it's a decently fun action RPG that accommodates almost any character build.It's not very hard, and the writing isn't very deep, but that makes it easy to dip in and out when you've only got a little time and want to go smack around some monsters or race through a short dungeon. This let it last a good while as my ""screwin' around"" game for when I just wanted something to kill time, while still making progress in the game.			",110,36,0,51,9,0,42

												SCORE: 90/100Hell yeah do I recommend this game. Want a better game than Fable but with the beautiful artstyle Fable had? Check. Want a game like Skyrim, but with better combat? Huge Check. Great music? Check. Big world to explore? Check. This is one of the most underrated games of all time. I'm having a blast playing this game. The only reason it is not more popular is because it came out the same time Skyrim did. But honestly, I've had more fun with Amalur than with Skyrim mainly because of the combat. I'm not saying it's a better game than Skyrim, just that the combat is MUCH better. Seriously, the combat system is probably the best in the open world, MMO-style, western RPGs you can play. It's fun, lots of combos, a lot of versatility, awesome abilities, cool weapons, an over-powered crafting system, cool looking armor, etc. You can easily sink over 100 hours into this game, and there's a lot to it. Lorestones with stat buffing, the crafting system is fun and easy to understand, the skill tree and the ability to combine classes adds for interesting and different combat styles, and the Threads of Fate is very satisfying to unleash on your opponent. You feel like a total badass with the seamless combat. I use a controller because it's easier to combo your main and secondary weapon, but there is a mod that allows to have your 1-8 keys set to Active Cast on your keyboard, that way pushing a key automatically casts the ability, instead of just equipping it. Whereas with a controller, you're limited to equipping a total of 4 abilties to the A,B,X,Y buttons. The one problem people keep mentioning, which I haven't run into yet, is the game becomes very very easy. But I think that's only if you start crafting super powerful weapons, which will take time leveling up your Blacksmith ability, and getting lucky enough to find the rare components and gems to make these items. HOWEVER, there is a mod that allows you to increase the difficulty, like smaller gains in experience, enemies hit harder, less gold found, health and mana regen is much slower, etc. I might use this because the level cap is very low. I'm already at level 21 with 44 hours put into this game. But I really love to play this game. The story is interesting, but it lacks main, memorable characters. It's a lot of NPCs with missions. I haven't been doing the main storyline yet. Just been doing sidequests because I love exploring the world and collecting items.			",55,7,0,10,1,0,3

												This game is my pride and joy ! I love it too much because there isn't anything like it when it comes to PC RPGs. You can play it with an XBOX controller for an immersive experience. The graphics are beautiful without being demanding so it should run flawlessly even on older PC's.              The story is intriguing but there is space for more.             Yes it's inspired from Fable or Witcher but hey those are awesome games and it's not just a crappy clone ; it somehow manages to be unique and fascinating. You can get lots of hours of fun by playing this game (probably hundreds of hours) so it deserves all the attention. Too bad the studios who created this little gem are now closed. They deserved more than that.             It kinda reminds me of MMORPG genre but that is not a bad thing.  It's a shame that MMO's are populated by jerks and kids - that's why i prefer anytime a single player experience. Call me crazy but that is how i see things - i just want to game in peace. The price is big on Steam but you get more than you pay - i got the game for free from a friend but i would have bought it without even thinking. it's A NO BRAINER!             Kingdoms of Amalur features five distinct regions, four playable races, and three class trees with 22 abilities per tree.The four playable races are the Almain (Civilized Humans), the Dokkalfar (Dark Elves), the Ljosalfar (Light Elves), and the Varani (Nomadic Humans).The player starts off as a ""blank slate"", but can afterwards choose a class among the three available in the game, which are called Might, Finesse, and Sorcery; they correspond to the fighter, rogue, and mage classes respectively. As the player fights and gains experience, additional levels are unlocked. With each level gained, the player gains three ability points which can be invested in the skill-tree system to unlock or augment the 22 abilities. By completing Faction quests and investing ability points, the player can also unlock various ""destinies"", which add positive buffs to the player.Combat is based on the timing of button presses, similar to an action role-playing game, with occasional quick time event cutscenes. The combat includes a 'fate' system which allows players to accumulate 'fate points' and ultimately enter 'Reckoning Mode', a slow motion mode that allows the player to quickly dispatch enemies. The Reckoning Mode may end on player's command, with the depletion of the fate bar or by the act of 'Fateshifting' an enemy. Fateshifting involves performing a brutal finishing move on a single enemy. During the cosmetic Fateshifting phase, the player may rapidly tap a random button (chosen and displayed by the game) to increase the experience yield up to 100%. After the Fateshifting, all weakened enemies also die.            The player can travel on land, jump down from predesignated spots and swim in the water. The player has the ability to communicate with, rob or kill NPCs; each of these actions have their own consequences. Lead combat designer Joe Quadara emphasized that ""twitch skill is only going to get you so far. Strategy and proper RPG playing is going to get you farther.""[5] 38 Studios founder Curt Schilling said that the style of the game would be a marriage between God of War and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.

												Kingdoms of Amalur sure feels like a refreshing wind after trying out a bunch of different mmorpgs and rpgs.This game combines the combat of many console-esque titles like God of War and Darksiders, with the lore and rpg-aspect of games like Dragon Age and Vampire the Masquerade (roughly speaking).LoreAfter playing around 12 hours I was feeling fairly immersed in the world of Amalur. Bit for bit you learn more and more about the lore, machinations of the world and all the colourful characters that inhabit it. You can go further by looking for ""lorestones"" across maps and reading books/scrolls that will teach you more about the Kingdom of Amalurs history, alas it is not mandatory for those who prefer to avoid lore alltogether and focus on the other aspects of the game.But for those who love lore like me, you'll notice that there has been placed a lot of thought into the this aspect of the game. I'm not aware if it's R.A. Salvatore or someone else who wrote the story, but it seems well thought out in overall.Size of game-worldThe game itself seems to be fairly large - the worldmap is quite grand & you travel between subzones on it. ""Clearing"" each area can sometimes take a couple of hours - so this game isn't really lacking content as to say. This game has easily 100+ hours of content to go through.QuestsSome people voice concern that the game is too ""grindy"" and compare it to games like World of Warcraft where you kill x amount of wild boars, and then move on to kill x amount of kobolds, etc. Amalur has these kind of quests too, but they are well mixed among very different and personalized quests which in my opinion makes the former ones bearable to a larger extent.VisualsThe visuals look good, even if you find odd low-res textures here and there which isn't as bad as it might sound as long as you don't expect ultra setting Skyrim ENB with high res textures-quality. Kingdoms of Amalur can also utilize the ENB-injector technology and give the world a more vivid look which I recommend for everyone who aren't satisfied with the default visuals of the game. You can grab it off the Skyrim Nexus site.ClassesOne of the games absolute strongpoints is the ""class""-system that Kingdom of Amalur has. You have a lot of options to combine and customize your own ""class"" - mix and match skills of different kinds. The game has the classic ""Warrior, rogue and sorcerer""-theme, but you can create hybrids of all combinations - and the ability to respecc for a sum of gold gives you a chance to try out different kinds of gameplay without having to create a new character every time.CombatThe combat is fast paced and fun. You unlock and learn new kinds of attacks and ""combos"" as the game progresses and you level up your character. The many kind of enemies and their behaviour means that you can't just spam attacks all the time (if you play on hard-difficulty), but you actually need to stop and block, or dodge attacks to be able to win. Thinking ahead is key, for example when positioning yourself so that all the enemies get in a big line infront of you, prior to using that powerful sword-attack that hits everything in a line up front.Minor flaws of the gameMy only gripe so far with this game has been minor annoyances like the FoV (which you can modify using a widescreen modification - google it!) and things like weapons sheathing too fast, both in and out of combat. I'd like to see more RP-aspects and abilities for the character, but seeing it being a single-player game - it's forgivable. The game is also not open-world, but rather ""instanced"". Still the ""instanced"" areas are often pretty large, way larger than what Dragon Age had for instance - thus making it forgivable too.ConclusionIn overall this game is fairly good if you're looking for decent story, engaging combat and many hours of gameplay. A little polish wouldn't hurt here and there though as I earlier mentioned. Unfortunately since the studio behind this game went into bankruptcy we can't be expecting any more updates, which is sad since the title has potential and I would personally be interested in purchasing a sequel if there ever was one.RatingGiving this game a 8 out of 10.

Here is a short overview:+  Excellent combat system:  Game is very fluid, rewards proper timing and position.+  Optimization:  Runs very well on pretty much any computer.+  Customization:  As a proper RPG, this game allows you to customize the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of your toon(with the ability to respec for a fee).-  Graphics:  Game looks a little cartoony but i'd imagine this was part of keeping the game as accessible as possible.-  Overpowering:  You quickly feel incredibly strong depending on how you specialize your character.So overall, the game is definitely worth the investment if you're a fan of Action-RPG's.

												Kingdoms of amalur: Reckoning is an open world action rpg with emphasis on combat.The game's plot is interesting in concept, but flawed in execution (more on that in a minute). The world is filled with powerful magic and watched over by a powerful race, the fae, split between the winter and summer court. They have lived in relative peace with the mortal races of humans and elves, until one day the winter fae attacked the mortal races. Unlike mortals though, the fae ressurect after a while, for no fae truly dies, or stays dead forever, while mortals do. You are the recently ressurected hunk of meat that takes whatever form you customised it to look like, dragged out of the well of souls, a magic item capable of bringing the dead back to life in massive numbers, except that you are its first and only success. You learn that on the day of rebirth, the winter fae have attacked the facility you are in just as you wake up, you are told about the well, what you are to a basic extent, and then told to flee the place before it caves down on your head, not before you learn you have weird powers, somehow connected to fate...Now, it turns out that everything and everyone has a fate, dictacted by the tapestry of fate, you however, are not connected to it, and can change it however you like, in theory. This is leads to one big problem. how linar the game actually is. You can do all the side quests in any order you like and follow a number of faction quests in whichever order you like as well, but, even if you have literally nothing binding you to a set path, no choices you make have that big of an impact, save for a handful. You are stuck following this same basic path up until the points where the game says you can make a choice, do you side with A, or B? Sometimes, if you are lucky, C. A good example is when a soldier who wants to sell everything he owns to the people of a town asks you to do it instead. You can buy all the items off him instead, but i wanted to give him way more money, maybe an OP sword i forged and make him feel better about life. I couldn't, i just had to follow the quest line mindlessly. the majority of quests can be summed up similarly. Most of the side quests are fetch quests, or ""go kill this"" quests, or delivery boy quests (where you go back and forth between two characters exchanging messages and items). You can ignore them, but even the major quest lines feel weak, the only entertaining ones were those to do with the fae, but i, at no point, was able to just do whatever i wanted. I can't explain how restricted i felt doing some of these quests, and how many of them felt extremely boring.The lore of the game is suprisingly well put together in some parts, i really loved the fae and how the winter and summer fae acted within the world. Both of the fae quest lines were the highlights of the game for me. That was the only bit of the story i found actually praise worthy.The game, apart from the dull quests and plot full of holes, is really fun. The combat system in this is very satisfying, you have a total selection of nine weapon types, each one with a few combos each, and a slew of special moves. The enemy variety isn't great, but its just good enough to stop the game from getting stale. In the early game, combat is a bit tough, especially against niskaru, but, by the mid to end game, its dreadfully easy, especially if you ever get health regen above 4 points per second and max out smithing and sagecraft, effectively allowing you to mass produce gear that outshines every other piece in the game. The game never felt truly challanging, except for a few bosses here and there, and the only time i was fully involved and entertained was when i was surrounded by a pack of niskaru and i was out of health potions, then it was challanging.Character progression is pretty in depth as well, you have three skill trees, magic, strength and stealth. You put points into various aspects to unlock and power up abilities, and if you put enough points into trees, you unlock classes, allowing you to gain bonuses to certain aspects of your character. I did however manage to break the game by unlocking the thunder storm ability, which was a mass AoE attack that also stunned and knock back, from there, it was down hill the moment i got chakrams, which were AoE melee weapons with high damage output.The art style is, overall, vibrant. Everything is saturated in a rich color scheme, and alot of the designs for the enemies are pretty interesting. Though, every last bit of armour and weaponry looks like it was pulled directly from an MMO (which this was originally meant to be, or at least, meant to be a pre-quel of if i recall). As such, its all rather over sized and silly looking. Your character looks like a goof, mainly because half the time you'll be running around with pieces of different armour sets that just do not blend together. Not to mention the rather limited character creation menu.This game isn't terrible, I would never talk anyone out of buying it unless they are specifically looking for great plot. Everything it does, it does to a decent standard and only in storytelling does it fail. It not an all time great, its not a hidden gem and its not a classic. Its more of a cult classic than anything. If you are looking for a standard, decent rpg with good combat and have some time to kill before you move onto something else, or just want an rpg who's entire focus is fae. Then this is a game for you. If you are looking for a strong plot or an rpg where every action you take directly influences the overall story for better or worse, avoid this.I personally found this to be...acceptable, I don't regret my time with it, nor do i think i'll recall this game with any amount of deep fondness. In truth, i tried to beat this twice as a console pleb back when i had a PS3. The game glitched and broke twice on me, around the 40 hour mark. So the main reason i bought it again and beat it was for closure. Having finished it, i can cry to the heavens ""Eh, it was alright"".			",309,84,0,101,11,0,29

												I knew nothing about this game before playing. I picked it up from my friend's library and after a few hours into it I knew I had to see the end. The game drew me into the role play straight away, so I bought my own copy. The variety of loot, freedom to choose how your character progresses, many options to craft weapons, armor and potions, beautiful graphics, and much more made this game very, very enjoyable. I think it should be recommended especially to those who aren't much experienced with RPG type games and want to try it. I'd also recommend getting the DLC's as there's more interesting content to play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's great for an old game, but the cons for me are the quests, there are just so many and sometimes it feels like ""blah blah blah"" a lot of the way through you just want to hurry them up and get them out of the way, that aside.. for me it's still worth playing.

												I'm writing this review after 120 hours of gameplay because that's how much time it took for me to make sure I left no stone unturned. Although I'm 100% sure I'll find new things when I eventually replay it, I might have missed a few quests by the end because I wanted to beat the final boss.+ Beautiful and diverse environment. Dalentarth and plains of Erathel looked similar, but Detyre was entirely different. I spent a lot of time taking screenshots because I wanted to show my friends what a beautiful game I'm playing.+ Rast Brattigan. I wish there were more NPCs like her.+ Great combat system. Reminded me of The Witcher 2.+ Mixed classes. By this I mean: everything goes. You want to be a 100% warrior? No problem. A battlemage? Gotchu. Equal parts of Might/Finesse/Sorcery? There's a destiny for that. I was playing a warrior-rogue hybrid charging into everything headfirst with a greatsword. Go crazy.+ Gathering ingredients is similar to how it was in Oblivion, meaning you can fail gathering a plant if you don't have enough points invested in alchemy. Also, the starting area is peppered with ingredients required for health potions, which is always nice, especially when you're new and don't know how to play.+ Voice Acting is superb. I'm sure half of NPCs were voiced by a 100 different people. If not, I'm still impressed. However, being a hardcore Dragon Age fan I couldn't help but hear Cullen in half of male NPCs and Loghain reciting me lore bits.+ Character customization. Especially the tattoo which at right settings could look like a scar.+ Chickens. Finally, nobody throws me in jail for accidentally killing a chicken or ten. There's even a ""Chickens slain"" count on your stats page.- Hard is normal, normal is easy, haven't tried easy difficulty but you get my meaning.- Stealth system is kinda weird? I was wearing heavy armor but with enough points invested in stealth I could sneak up on enemies and execute them, at least in the beginning of the game.- Some abilities in your preferred ability tree are kinda useless but you have to invest points in them anyway because the next level requires a certain amount of points.- Some items stay in your inventory after the quest is finished and you can't sell them. This becomes less of a problem halfway through the game when you have maxed out inventory space and don't need more money than you can find on your travels, but scrolling through 30 unwanted items while looking for a repair kit was kinda off-putting.- There little incentive to buy anything other than backpacks. By checking every corner I already had good weapons and armor and I didn't need to buy them. Had 5 Million gold by the end of the game, most of that from enemy drops and quest rewards.- Some bugs are game-breaking. I recommend making a hard save before every main quest. Some bugs make it unable to continue with it thus preventing access to other areas.- Man Boss can be defeated in about 5 minutes if you stock up on a certain potion, making it easier than common trolls.

												Why have I waited so long to recommend this game? Why? I know why, because I thought, 'When I get to the end of the game, I'll have a true appreciation of it, thereby writing something from my extensive knowledge.'  Yeah, sure. At level eighteen and about sixty some odd hours in, I'm no where close to finishing. So onto my actual review:This game is actually really good and I feel it's been overlooked. I honestly feel it is a diamond in the rough. It -is- similar to Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, but let me tell you something fascinating. I bought ES:Skyrim before I bought KOAR (Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning) and when I bought it and played it, I did -not- care for it. I was lambasted, cast out and disowned but there it is. I didn't like it. Now flash forward to spending time in Reckoning, I want to go back and play Skyrim. That's how much enjoyment I've gotten from this game. It takes me back to a place when I started playing World of Warcraft. There were these amazing characters, this fascinating storyline, beautiful artwork. This, that and the other. Eventually I fell out of love with World of Warcraft, but this game takes me back to that feeling of rolling my first character. The combat is very user friendly. I would akin it to hack and slash, but I feel that simplifies it far too much. You have abilities, the way you unravel the fate of a foe is cinematic and enjoyable, somehow savagely satisfying.  The talent trees are easy enough to navigate. Much in the spirit of Skyrim, you can choose what you want to be and whether you want to go, might, finesse or mage, or all three or two or...you get where I'm going.The skills are pretty neat, you have options on alchemy, a sort of jewelcrafting, blacksmithing, lockpicking, dispelling...and on and on. I wouldn't recommend lockpicking as the lockpicks are cheap, cheap and even the 'hard' chests are done simply enough.The quests are pretty fascinating, especially the main quests. There are some side quests that will have you fetch and step bear butts but its to be expected with any sort of RPG, in my opinion. Character creation is neat, not overly detailed but enough where you get your input in. If you're expecting to spend 3 hours lost in faces, noses, ears and hair style, you will be let down. This game is not linear. You can put off the main quest indefinitely if you so wish, there are factions to join and quest for, increasing your reputations with them. There are choices to be made to decide the moral ambitions of your character, there are persuasions to attempt, assassinations to be had and endless monsters to slay until your heart is bursting with contentment.TL;DR? Does it revolutionize the RPG genre with it's intuitive and mind-blowing format? Not so much. Does it bring out some of the -best- of what we love in RPG's? I firmly say, yes. Is it worth purchasing? Absolutely. I think if you're a fan of RPG's you will find hours and hours worth of enjoyment, plus replayablitiy. 8/10			",43,15,0,12,7,0,10

												good story with a very detailed world. This game will keep you occupied for at least  100 hours if intend to finish all the sidequests ( and boi there are a lot of these with questionable worthwile rewards...)the fighting (and there's a lot of it) is nice and fast.. and it's not entirely all about gear. You can even prevail with inferior gear because the dodge/block system is well balanced. The loot is in fact what i didn't liked about the game. there was just too much chests to loot. Enemies also respawn if you use fast travel too frequently. On the other hand every respawned enemey has the chance of a new awesome item.. but as i said.. even if your gear is ♥♥♥♥♥♥.. you can still have the upper hand in fights if you have the right skills or time you blocks&dodges properly. (biased) downsides: - too much loot imho ( yeah.. it's not a diablo.. and it shouldn't try to be)- respawning enemies- low fov (use widescreen fixer (google it))- play the game on hard or you won't have a challenge)the gameworld is really beatiful  and eyecatchy and the game does not end when you finish the main storyline. also it has a lot of the little things you miss in other games or only get them if you buy a dlc. (changing appearance, re-roll your skills, housing (to some extend...),...)all in all def worth the money if you have the time to embrace the story and beatiful world it takes place in.

The monsters are a bit repetative but what do you do when you see a lot of repetative mobs?Kill them all.The story line is also well thought out with extensive and detailed lore.I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys mmo's and action games.A side note; you will become incredibly powerful in this game. Hard mode is the way to go if you want a sight challenge, but the game isn't very hard to play. Great for the casual gamer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I may finishe the game, but at least with the 80+ hours I have logged I will say that I have enjoyed it. The story is kind of predictable, and I wish the crating system was more complex, but I like the variety of what you can do, and it is visually compelling.			",19,2,0,14,0,0,3

												I think this game is amazing, I sunk 25 or so hours in before even touching the main story line. To me, it feels like everything Skyrim could have been. The graphics are quite good, the look and feel is great, the voice acting is decent, quests are varied in a number of ways and the combat is amazing. Althoguh it doesn't do anything insanely special, it does a lot of stuff really, really well, making it a very polished game.The one thing that annoyed me quite a bit, as I frequently used reskilling as a way to keep the game and combat fresh and exciting, was that there were always a number of skill points that were wasted on things I didn't need or use but were required to unlock the next tier of skills.Very good game all around though, I hope more games come out with well rounded quality like this.

												Awesome game. It's like the artistic style of Fable and Oblivion got blended together with the playstyle of open worldness of Skyrim and, to some degree, combat mechanics capturing the essence of God of War. The story is enthralling and the gameplay completely open for you to choose how you wish to approach it. Not to mention that it looks completely amazing, and the load screens are seconds long, never having one longer than 10 seconds, even with the settings maxed out on my somewhat dated machine.Something I wasn't expecting when I got this game, was how mature the story and some of the kills are, though tastefully done. If anything, I'd call it a positive that they made this game more adult oriented.I really love this game, thus far, and it has tons of replay pottential. The only thing I find that could detract my love for this game is the apparent time it takes to complete, which I've seen many say is about 200 hours of gameplay. Be warned of that.

												Honestly don't know where this game came from, there was literally NO advertisment. I heard about this game from a friend and when i watched him play it i thought it looked dull and unoriginal....I've never been so wrong in my life. Let me start off by saying this is one of the most underated RPG games in history, this game is overflowing in content that you can easily sink hours of your life into. The best features must be the gameplay and the atmosphere. Combat is fluid and visually appealing, and the atmosphere is jaw dropping in ALL locations, absolutly beautiful environment. DLC is really really good as well. My only half con would be the main story is subpar at best, but the combat and atmosphere will make it an experience to remember. Grab this game you won't regret it.			",68,7,0,15,5,2,1

												Aside from the tragic story behind the creation of this game and leading to its generally buggy state (which generated my only negative opinions about this game), Kingdoms of Amalur is an excellent story. I haven't played many RPGs recently, having experienced more than a few failed starts in the genre. Amalur has made me excited once more to try out a new RPG.The storytelling is excellent and the depth of the lore is very satisfying. There are even some solid gameplay elements present, with some of the combat experiences feeling quite exhilirating. It doesn't stray too far from the RPG formula, but introduces enough new gameplay elements to be interesting. Although the story presents the main character as being ""fateless,"" it should be noted there is but one fate available: the one the writers intended. I don't mind, because I rather enjoy experiencing a story in this fashion. Also, this is linearity done correctly: a nuanced, cohesive and satisfying story.Please be warned: this game is very buggy. Remember to use multiple saves and to save often, especially if you suspect you might be entering a pivotal scene in the game's storyline. More than once, I had to reset and start entire areas over because of game-breaking bugs. Also, of course, if you are looking for a game more than you are looking for a story then you should look elsewhere.This is one of the best RPGs I've ever had the pleasure to experience.

												****Big Bang Theory**** Oblivion + Forgotten Realms + Spawn = Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning!!! What do you get when you lock Ken Rolston, R. A. Salvatore, and Todd McFarlane in a Dungeon for a year?? ""Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning!!!"" Ok maybe it took longer than a year but whos counting anyways? To Keep this review short and simple let me first state that this game is a open-world singleplayer RPG with a hint of MMORPG feeling to it. The graphics are outstanding and considering Todd McFarlane did the artwork you just know your gonna see some pretty unique landscapes and characters. The musical score is done by Grant Kirkhope and he has crafted a collection of pleasant and delightful pieces in this game. The story telling and voice acting are rock solid. Gameplay is similar to Fable and combat at times feels a bit like God of War. This game is simply amazing and should be played by any true RPG fans.			",671,212,14,132,40,5,147

												In Amalur there is a war between motals and immortals, and guess who's loosing. Everyone's destiny is already known and there's nothing they can do, until a hero is awakened from the dead, the only mortal who lives again. The only one without fate, only you can change the fate of the whole world. You are limitless, what are you going to do? The game offers you three playstyles or mix of them. Rogue, mage or warrior. I tried to play as a rogue, but it still ended as me running everywhere and shooting everyone with powerful arrows, much more useful, quicker and funnier than sneaking and backstabbing, what a shame. My only ability was always active boost on attacks. In game there are also some crafting options like blacksmithing, jewerlycrafting, alchemy and so on, but it also won't help you. I ended looting and buying everything instead of using profesion skills. The best part of the game is the story which is a little confusing I tried hard but I couln't remember all those names so I just focused on the main line and what happened in Amalur without details. If you are looking somthing easy and casual I think this is for you. I think this game is a little overrated.6.5 /10			",320,92,7,54,60,4,68

												This game is a real hidden gem. It's not perfect, but it is very good. Combat is fun and interesting. You can mix up your playstyles as and when you wish. Got bored of being a stealthy assassin? Become a mage and blow everything up.The storyline is interesting and well told with lots of lore sprinkled around the game. The maps won't boggle your brain and few overly complicated puzzles to solve, but to many that's a good thing. Pros - Truely beautiful backdrops and sceneryGreat combat that feels fluidThe ability to change playstyle easily, totally changing your character if you feel like it.Well told storyLots of items, lore and things to find.Cons -Even on hard, the game felt easy (or maybe my mage was just grossly over powered)Master crafted gear made with good parts will make you godly beyond what any Unique will make you and it can get very silly. As a mage I could tankt he final boss of the DLCs and let my Summon finish them off for me, while not wearing my robes or using block.Overall a great game, and one I would very much recommend spending time and money on.

												I don't understand why this game couldn't sell enough copies to stay afloat. It's beautiful, huge, high fantasy, with fun combat. Borrows from Fable, Diablo, Elder Scrolls. Lots of side missions and lore, good voice acting. It's a really solid rpg and I wish they were still working on the sequel.Only complaint is that the pc port was obviously hurried and they'll never fix the bugs now (eg quests menu is totally unusable on larger monitors, no walk speed, redonkulous unchangeable menu key bindings).

												Bought the game during the Steam sale. Only about 13 hours into it versus the 250+ I've got in Skyrim. So far, I love the game. The visuals are fantastic--especially when using a weapon or spell. The landscape is beautiful too.  Although the amount can get tedious, it is nice having NPCs with complete dialogue. The music is great and I plan on buying the soundtrack. Quite a few similarities to Skyrim (and I'm OK with that). Overall, very pleased with the game and looking forward to playing it again soon. I highly recommend this game.			",3,1,0,7,0,0,0

												I got this game while it was on sale for $4.99 or so, and by that measure, it was a great game.  The graphics were clean and nice but nothing spectacular, the progressing moves are visually impressive and fun, and the quests are plentiful; but there are a few things that I found disappointing that others may like to know before buying.1) Repetative - Like most RPGs, the repetitive nature is unavoidable, but in the case of Reckoning it was exhausting.  Every quest was the same (Kill/harvest __# of enemies/objects, find and rescue this person) so much so that I found myself avoiding side quests about 40 hours into the game.  2) Scaled leveling - while some enjoy this, I like to feel a bit of power as I progress through a game.  The fact that boggarts (low level creatures which are succeptible to fire) took increasing amounts of swings/spells to kill was annoying, and while easy, fights seemed to drag on for insane amounts of time.3) Immersion - I'm a big morrowind fan, and I tend to like RPGs that are as immersive as that game was to me in 2003.  That being said I still like to hold each game in it's own light but found myself wanting more immersion with Reckoning.  Part of this I feel is due to the boundaries imposed by the designers...most games that lack a jump button or prohibit movement outside of predetermined area tend to feel less inviting for some reason - even if that inviting feeling leads to my death by gravity.  4) Quest Tracking - You are only able to track 1 quest at a time. This forced fast a lot of fast travel for me because the next quest was across the huge map.  I hate to reference WoW, but their quest tracker is heavily missed in a world this large.  The problem with fast travel for me is that I stop paying attention to the surroundings and start feeling like I'm doing a chore.  This may just be a personal thing but I feel it's worth mentioning.5) Customization - The options menu is disparaging.  You can't upgrade graphics options, you can't remap some movements (going in and out of quest, inventory, map menus) required hitting ""esc"" key), the game is stuck in its out of the box condition.6) Story - combined with the quest issue, this kind of ties in with immersion, and made the story feel forced and generally bland.  There were a few moments where I was intruiged but for the most part it was lackluster.I would liken this game to Fable in its mechanics and feel, though Fable (the original) was designed and paced much better.  The game is enjoyable and fun, simply not astounding.  If there were a star rating on Steam, I would rate it 3/5, and it wouldn't surprise me if a 3.5/5 rating was the norm			",75,17,0,9,6,0,1

												Overall, the game is pretty good. The main problem is that it's too easy. With Lorestones and unlockable Destinies, there are no shortages of permanent bonuses. If by the end of the game you have fewer than 30 bonus mods not related to your equipment, you must be doing a speed run.Each area apparently has a level range, and the levels of enemies get locked to your level within that range the first time you visit the area. There are no areas where the minimum level is 40+, meaning after you get to a certain point, leveling further becomes impossible. Luckily, 40 is more than enough to become totally invincible, especially with the Dead Kel DLC. With some clever blacksmithing, you can end up one-shotting many foes, and bosses will take no more than 4 hits. Also, the map you have is magic. For most quests, they ask you to go somewhere and find something or kill something, and the map knows exactly where it is, even if you haven't been there before. The Lost Treasure Of Meropis is a quest to find a bunch of relics sunken in various bodies of water. Surprise, surprise, it's not a ""lost"" treasure for long because your map knows exactly where all the relics are. This happens in 95% of quests. NPC's will be totally amazed that you found the lost journal of a long-dead scholar or the bandit-in-hiding.This aside, The world is pretty large and decently well-rounded. Some of the quests are pretty interesting on their own, but most will seem silly. With a little work, your character will soon be the undefeated champion gladiator, the archsage of the largest group of mages, the king of a bunch of immortals, etc. Sadly, no NPC will know you are more than one of these at a time.The fighting system is pretty good overall but again very biased in your favor. With the exception of certain bosses, no regular enemy has more than 2 or 3 attacks, many of which are staggered so you have time to react. The variety of enemies is lacking considering the size of the world so you can quickly learn how to deal with them all and then demolish everything standing in your way.The storyline is alright once you properly understand how literal the characters are when they talk about fate. The Fae are pretty much stuck in an eternal loop of rebirth and redoing the same thing as last time, and knowing that they are doing it. The other races have fate issues too and your character seems to be the only exception. All things stem from this.From what I've seen of Skyrim, this game seems very similar to it, except this version seems to be more rushed in it's development and a little buggy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												WOW, Another MUST have game IMHO !!!I waited a Long time to play this game & get a price drop on STEAM compared to retail/Etail editions due to some problems with the dev going under.This game has EVERYTHING i Love in a Arpg, looks great, plays silky smooth (on a old system gtx285/q9550/8gb ram), more then enuff replay value with tonnes of good loot to be found.The game has lots of depth, decisions you make actually make a difference in the game.If you like to explore & want to get everything out of the game be prepared to sink hundreds of hrs into this lovely game.The music & atmosphere help to project you further into this realm of Amalur, it really is a joy just listening & watching all that is going on.Unlock abilities & truelly have a say in what u can craft/disasemble as U lvl Up in the game.Some will say you waste time with side quests but i find it all adds up for those that love to dig deep & explore the world.I love all the abilities this game has, something i just found out today is pickpocketing, i was like DANG, wish i knew that from the start, oh well....i can't read manuals, i just ""GAME"".This game has an artistic feel to some other rpg's i really like like torchlight, some will argue it but each to their own evaluation.For me, i Know a game is Golden when initially i i play it 18hrs+ & can't stop playing it till i finish.This game is possessing me to finish it like the Batman series did, it Truelly is an addictive game.P.S:  BUY this game if u love Arpg's or ""1st person view"" rpg's in general !Is it worth FULL PRICE for the base game ? HELL YEAH, is the DLC package worth it ? i don't know but if it's like the base game i say YES.Obviously to those wanting to save $ on a sale of 50% min it's a NO brainer !!!Another note: the ""Weapons & Armor Bundle"" seemed to be WEAK, if you use it right away then it may be ""OK"" but if u sit on the fence before using it after many hrs of play it seems like a ripoff. (IMHO)PLEASE DO BUY skills for $ from NPC trainers lvl1-3Good day & DO pick up this wonderful game, i hope the IP wasn't lost & that there will be another edition, but it seems like that won't be the case:(WIN 7 64x works without issue on my system !!!specs are:q9550gtx285 (SLI) Not used8gb ram2tb hdd..... 256gb ssd			",447,26,40,47,15,0,17

												This game is often compared to Skyrim, for a reason. Both present a huge, open fantasy world with hundreds of quest which can be taken in no particular order. This is, however, where any similarities with Skyrim end. Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning has stunning and very colorful visuals that had me hooked in an instant. I pay a LOT of attention to scenarios in RPGs, and Amalur probably has the most beautiful I've ever seen. The forests, ruins and towns really give you the impression of a world full of things to explore. That being said, there are a bunch of things that feel ""off"" in this game. The gameplay is just fine: not brilliant but not bad either. It is not a challenging game and most of the time I just found easier to hack and slash my way to victory than to use spells or rogue abilites. The way your casting is interrupted by literally any attack is really annoying and counterintuitive. The most powerful AoE spells take a long time to cast, and should be more useful against several enemies, but chances of being interrupted are huge and therefore said spells become useless. Like I said, the melee strategy was the most efficient by far for me, which is a little underwhelming since I really like using magic. Another problem with Amalur: questing. 90% of quests will reward you with gold and experience. The quests have some cool stories and lore behing them, but being rewarded with the same things over and over agains becomes tiresome, especially considering you won't need that amuch gold. There's also no reason NOT to use the ""fast travel"" ability, which makes exploring the world less interesting as well. You won't get cool random events like in Skyrim, ever. 90% of the experience you get comes from quests as well, so fighting monsters is not a reason to backtrack ON FOOT (because there are no mounts).To be honest I think Amalur should have inspired itself in Skyrim even more. Maybe it didn't had the budget to do so, I don't know. I highly recommend this game for anyone who is crazy about fantasy and cool scenarios (like me), but be mindful that most of it's problems are glaringly obvious for players who are used to play lots of RPG games. That being said, Amalur does provide a satisfying experience under its own limitations.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rating: 7/10Overview: Third Person Action RPGThe Good:+ Character development is really the highlight of the game. By investing skill points across three different skill trees; might, finesse and magic you can develop a play style to your liking. Depending on where you spend your skill points you can unlock passive bonuses in the form of fate cards. The good thing about this is that you can spend skill points across all three skill trees and unlock some really cool bonus perks or you can focus all your skills on a single tree and unlock another set of perks. Its a really good system because it allows for so much flexibility. While most action rpgs require you to focus on a few skills, amalur allows the option for spreading your skill points over multiple skill trees without it hurting you.   + Combat is fun and fluid and fit the skill trees perfectly. The combat is very accessible and easy to learn right from the start. The only downside is that you can only assign skills to 4 slots on the controller making it very hard to make a build with more than 4 skills. + Tons of weapons and armor that make you look incredibly cool. Every type of weapon set has their own unique move set.  + The environments are bright and colorful. Most areas feel distinct from one another. + For a game this size and this much content it is incredibly well polished, very few glitches or bugs to be found.+ Although the UI is clearly designed around controller support, the UI is surprisingly well done. Accepting any side quests will automatically show every waypoint on your minimap. Finding items in the game world, you can compare, take, equip or place it directly in your junk pile without ever having to open a menu. Little things like this really help the game and provide a much smoother experience.   + SoundtrackThe Average:The game features a ton of content; lots of locations, dungeons to explore, side quests to tackle, characters to meet, cities to travel to etc. It is everything you would expect from a large scale RPG. The problem however is that non of this is really interesting. The dungeons are linear hallways with little to no exploration, all the character are boring and say the same things, all the Sid quests devolve into kill x number of enemies, collect x number of items, gather x number of ingredients etc... The game features so much content but very little depth. Of course this is a matter of opinion, and if you find the main story and side quests to your liking then you are going to love everything this game has to offer.  Exploration feels limited. You can not jump nor can you fall off ledges. Level design seems to be very flat. The Field of view (FOV) is a bit to close to the character making combat a bit weird sometimes. Luckily there is a third party program that can fix this, however you should never have to use a program for an option that should be in the game. Bosses feel under utilized, feels like wasted potential.  The Bad:- This game is not balanced at all, even at the hardest setting you can quickly kill enemies early on. If you craft or socket any high level gear the game becomes even more broken to the point of one shot killing enemies. Completing too many side quest will cause you to over level too early on. If you want any challenge you have to purposefully hinder yourself. The lack of difficulty really hurts the game because it makes an otherwise fun combat system, trivial. - Gold is also meaningless. You will quickly have more gold than you know what to do with, buying items/weapons is useless as you will usually find better gear just by killing or looting treasure chests. Conclusion:When I first heard about Kingdoms of Amalur I thought it would be one of my favorite games. I loved the idea behind the character creation, sadly everything surrounding that concept turned out to be average. I had high hopes for the game that never materialized.			",731,344,32,73,63,8,96

												I've played the crap out of this game and it is awesome. The storyline is rich, the character creation wasn't too in-depth, the skills are freakin awesome, and the quests are numerous. Definitely has replay value since you can choose different skills to level and options to take in conversation. I wouldn't call it revolutionary but it's certainly fun to play. Good mechanics with very little bugs, even though I can't recall any at the moment. The voice acting is not cheesy so it doesn't ruin the game. I'm a fan of single player rpg's and this one got me. Epic battles.			",178,26,2,24,7,0,7

												The game is Action RPG, but it feels like offline MMO and its quite massive to complete. here some pros and cons: +Colorful Environment [Mid-Anime] +Massive areas to explore +Crafting (potions, armors, weapons etc.) +Leveling system (max. 40) +Home upgrades+Abilities and cards system-Shallow main story-Auto-save mechanics are not working properly. (be sure to quick save) -Repetitive soundtrack (gets quite boring after a while) -Repetitive mobs (enemies) -NPC Lip-sync is a total disaster-Lots of side quests (but meaningless)In conclusion is a good game and I quite enjoy it. ...even better if you bought it on sales. 7/10			",110,20,1,10,4,1,1

												Kingdoms is one of those hidden gem games. With gameplay and a questing system similar to World of Warcraft, an incredibly rich and detailed lore and an absolutely massive world to explore, Kingdoms should have enough in it to keep you occupied for hours.

Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning has all the trappings of a traditional action RPG along with a few unique claims to fame.  One of those claims is the development agenda and post-production of this game, a very interesting story in itself, but that has little bearing on the game as is, which offers some good Fantasy fun.  It helps to understand KoA:R in the context of Big Huge Games, 38 Studios, Project Copernicus and the game owners bankruptcy and default on a $75 million loan from the state of Rhode Island.  If the experience feels like an mmorpg in single player mode, that's because the game was more or less a template for the planned but never completed Copernicus.  Despite having strong opinions about this whole business, I won't say more since it's been covered well in the news, and at this point it's old news.  The story was crafted in large part by one of my favorite Fantasy novelists, R.A. Salvatore, and the quality shows.  Plentiful lore and background is there to find if you bother listening to dialogue, reading books and paying attention to quests.  In particular I enjoyed the Fae (Elves) Houses.  Their social traditions, internal politics and perceptions of the mortal races reflect the Fae's immortality/reincarnation in interesting ways.  Gameplay is rock solid.  It is slightly reminiscent of Fable.  Options for stealth, hack n'slash, melee, ranged, martial or magic devastation all stem from a clever class/skill mechanic seated in the game's lore about fate.  Essentially there are three archetypes: Warrior, Rogue, Mage - and three types that are hybrids of those.  The combat is engaging however you choose, with various combos and skills to mix it up.  The monsters are diverse and will keep you on your toes, although it is possible to skill and gear up to a point where the player is virtually unkillable, rendering tactics irrelevant and thus diminishing the satisfaction of well executed fights.  That only happens in late game though; plus, you can always increase the difficulty!  I played the entire game on the standard difficulty setting.  Design overall isn't all that innovative save for a few aspects.  It feels a little bit generic and safe as fantasy RPG's go.  One issue I had was that pacing seemed a little off.  I explored side areas and finished every faction questline in addition to many side quests, but still wasn't quite able to unlock the highest tier of the Fate system (classes) until the very end of the campaign.  Also, towards the halfway point and onwards, some side quests felt like derivative, cliche filler content for the level grind.  It felt like an mmo.  This wasn't a huge problem, just an annoyance.  Backpack expansions should be slightly more frequent and the inventory should have more categories for crafting materials in the trade interface.  The technical issues are few.  One rare but recurring problem is that the camera - during and immediately following combat - likes to get fancy and zoom out or chase the player at certain distances.  The camera gets stuck sometimes, or shows a bad angle that hinders combat.  Quest and lore items shouldn't count towards the inventory item limit.  For some odd reason, you can't switch from the journal to the map without first closing the journal.  Like so many RPG's, this one has recycled voice actors even for primary characters.  While the world is huge and varied, certain areas feel strangely boxed in when they shouldn't.    The music and the voice acting are brilliant here.  I was especially pleased with how high quality and well fleshed out the dialogue was.  The visuals are beautifully realized and have some fun fantasy art concepts behind them.  On the other hand, given the budget of this game it doesn't reflect the money spent in my opinion.    I did not play the two content DLC's, Legend of Dead Kel and Teeth of Naros.  I recommend Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning to any fantasy aficionado.  If you check this out, you'll probably be glad you did.  I cannot necessarily recommend it to players with no patience or time for branching out from the main quest to see side content, or for players who are utterly uninterested in seeing more of the same from the fantasy genre.TIP: Use Reckoning as often as your fate bar fills up, since it rewards bonus experience for kills.TIP: The gear obtained via crafting (Blacksmithing plus Sagecrafting) tends to be the most powerful.  Crafting is greatly facilitated by diligent gathering of materials in the world and the salvaging of looted armor & weapons.TIP: Finish all of the faction quest lines at least, since those are among the more interesting content.

Posted: February 3, 2014
												Summary:  I highly recommend Amalur for anyone looking to scratch that high fantasy RPG itch until the next great title comes along.  For the full purchase price of $20, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a solid purchase.  For $6 when the game goes on sale like it is now, it's a ridiculous bargain.  Background (or why my hours played is so low but the review remains relevant :P ):  I originally bought this game a month ago through Origin (don't hate, back then it was seven dollars there vs twenty here) where I clocked in over 90 hours of game time and finished the game.  Well, currently Steam has the Amalur Collection on sale for $12 that includes the core game, both DLCs and a weapon/armor bundle.  Back on Origin the DLCs cost $10 a piece so I just went ahead and bought the entire collection here.  So on to the review!Pros:  (1)  This game is massive.  And I mean MASSIVE.  I stopped doing side quests about 1/3 - 1/2 way through the game because I wanted to see how the main quest line would end, and it still took me 90 hours to finish the game.  So if you're a completionist and you decide to explore the entire map and do every single quest my guess is the game offers around 200 hours of game time.  For six dollars that's... kind of crazy.  And yes, you can continue adventuring and discover/finish side quests after completing the main story line.  :)(2)  Combat is fun and fast paced, with fluid animations, nice particle effects, and charge ups/combos galore.  There are three schools of combat skills available (basically mage, warrior, thief), but you can explore any and all of them without restriction and for a price you can respec your character any time you want through a number of vendors in the game. (3)  The voice acting is solid.  One of the worst sins a RPG can commit to kill immersion is to populate their world with terrible voice actors.  Luckily they avoid that problem here.  You might still meet the random side quest character who could have put in a little more emotion here or a bit less ham there, but all the main characters do a fine job carrying out their roles as do most of the secondary cast.(4)  The game world is well developed.  A good RPG needs an immersive game world to lose oneself in, and Amalur does a good job on this front.  First, the world lore is well fleshed out with books and lorestones (think audio books) scattered throughout the world providing history, context and even humour.  Second, the game world looks nice, especially for a two year old title.  The stylistic approach they took is very high fantasy, with colorful and vibrant settings, so if you're looking for an overall darker/perpetual winter type environment you might be disappointed.  (5)  The game is stable and bug free.  In 90 hours of game play, I've only come across one bug.  Unfortunately that bug did force me to load up a previous save game to proceed in that side quest, but 1 bug in 90 hours of game play is pretty darn good.  For those who buy this game and are curious, the bug takes place right before your conversation with Sir Sagrell on the House of Ballads quest line, so just save before then and you should be golden.(6)  You get to support the state of Rhode Island!  After Steam takes its cut, proceeds from Steam sales of Amalur goes to RI, not EA.  Well, okay, if you hate the state of RI I guess this would be a con.  I've never visited RI, but as the tiniest state in the US I have a soft spot for them.  Guess it's just me rooting for the little guy.  :DCons:(1)  No more support.  The company that developed Amalur is bankrupt, and its assets scattered to the four winds (or RI in this case which was the company's largest creditor).  So there aren't going to be any sequels, or patches, for this game.  Ever.  (2)  The camera is too zoomed in and you can't manually zoom out.  This REALLY bugged me when I first started playing this game.  The camera automatically zooms out in combat to fit all the people on the screen as well as during special attack animations, so the game is fully capable of zooming in and out.  They just decided to be lazy and not implement a manul zoom function for the PC.  -.-  After a few hours, I got used to it but chances are it's going to bug you too if you're a regular PC player (apparently this is a console port issue?).  I've read you can fix this by using Widescreen Fixer, but I haven't tried this so YMMV. (3)  The story is just adequate when it could have been so much more.  At its core, the main story itself is derivative of many other fantasy tales.  Their focus on the interplay of Desinty vs Free Will offers it a refreshing change of pace, but the game never takes that extra push to make its stories truly emotionally gripping.  For example, one of the more interesting and sympathetic characters I ran across was an antagonist who has been condemned to play the part of a villain in a never-ending, repeating fairy tale for all eternity.  So yes, she's a villain, but she's a villain who is doing these things to break the cycle where she is condemned to play the villain forever, and forever.  And while the game lets you choose her side in the end, the resolution just never reaches any kind of deeper emotional crescendo or pathos like they could have if they dug just a little deeper.(4)  The depth of your relationship with other characters are just adequate.  This, similar to the story, is an issue of wasted potential.  Like the story, the personality of the people you meet and their relationship to your character is portrayed in a perfectly adequate matter, but it never progresses beyond that.  We learn that our character had a past relationship with some of these people, but the relationships never really evolve in the here and now.  Sure some of them greet you differently after you've helped them, praise you, even call you their lord, but a true emotional connection or investment just isn't there.  Contrast this to titles like Dragon Age or Mass Effect where it was your relationships that basically made the game so great and.. well... so... much... potential... :((5)  Some of the dungeon layouts are not very optimized for fun.  Barring its many flaws on release, one of the things Skyrim did very well was their intelligent dungeon map layouts.  Every dungeon was set out so that it would either loop in itself or end at another exit so you didn't have to track through an already cleared dungeon to leave.  Amalur does this for its main dungeons and most of the side quest ones, but they neglect to do this for a noticeable number as well which, well, is just dumb.  This might not seem like a big deal, but when you're talking about a 200 hour game with countless dungeons, it gets very annoying having to backtrack through an empty dungeon just to exit.  Conclusion:  All in all, this is a solid RPG romp through a well developed and entertaining land of magic and adventure.  And at six dollars, or even twenty, I would give it a solid recommendation.  So get out there, craft your own Destiny, and happy questing!  :)			",4,1,0,0,0,0,1

												Eighty Plus hours into this epic I finally finished. This game is both a wonderful first and last title from this company. But all that aside it did so many things right. Fun gameplay although it could be quite quircky at times. The best part of this game is content for the price. So much to do! Over 244 quests I think and so many other things to distract you on your epic journey. While the story telling isn't grand its the world that you are released into that is....vibrant colors and beautiful landscapes are around every corner. If your a fan or fantasy and need something to distract you. You certainily cant do much better than this gem. 7/10			",79,8,0,11,1,0,9

												A very fun blend of action and RPG.Pros:- Great combat system. Involves reflexes, timing and combining your skills.- Nice character development with 3 directions you can mix freely: strength, wizardry and dexterity.- Various abilities you can invest in that make you better in different things.- You can change your skill choice in game.- Huge world to explore.Cons:- In battle, it takes too long after delivering or getting a hit, until your next action. It can be annoying sometimes.- Abilities are not balanced and you will definitely be weaker if you invest in the wrong ones. Fortunately you can always change your ability point allocation in game.- Races are pointless because they differ in their initial ability scores, so there is a clearly best race.- Plot is boring.

												Rating: 7/10Overview: Third Person Action RPGThe Good:+ Character development is really the highlight of the game. By investing skill points across three different skill trees; might, finesse and magic you can develop a play style to your liking. Depending on where you spend your skill points you can unlock passive bonuses in the form of fate cards. The good thing about this is that you can spend skill points across all three skill trees and unlock some really cool bonus perks or you can focus all your skills on a single tree and unlock another set of perks. Its a really good system because it allows for so much flexibility. While most action rpgs require you to focus on a few skills, amalur allows the option for spreading your skill points over multiple skill trees without it hurting you.   + Combat is fun and fluid and fit the skill trees perfectly. The combat is very accessible and easy to learn right from the start. The only downside is that you can only assign skills to 4 slots on the controller making it very hard to make a build with more than 4 skills. + Tons of weapons and armor that make you look incredibly cool. Every type of weapon set has their own unique move set.  + The environments are bright and colorful. Most areas feel distinct from one another. + For a game this size and this much content it is incredibly well polished, very few glitches or bugs to be found.+ Although the UI is clearly designed around controller support, the UI is surprisingly well done. Accepting any side quests will automatically show every waypoint on your minimap. Finding items in the game world, you can compare, take, equip or place it directly in your junk pile without ever having to open a menu. Little things like this really help the game and provide a much smoother experience.   + SoundtrackThe Average:The game features a ton of content; lots of locations, dungeons to explore, side quests to tackle, characters to meet, cities to travel to etc. It is everything you would expect from a large scale RPG. The problem however is that non of this is really interesting. The dungeons are linear hallways with little to no exploration, all the character are boring and say the same things, all the Sid quests devolve into kill x number of enemies, collect x number of items, gather x number of ingredients etc... The game features so much content but very little depth. Of course this is a matter of opinion, and if you find the main story and side quests to your liking then you are going to love everything this game has to offer.  Exploration feels limited. You can not jump nor can you fall off ledges. Level design seems to be very flat. The Field of view (FOV) is a bit to close to the character making combat a bit weird sometimes. Luckily there is a third party program that can fix this, however you should never have to use a program for an option that should be in the game.

If you want any challenge you have to purposefully hinder yourself. The lack of difficulty really hurts the game because it makes an otherwise fun combat system, trivial. - Gold is also meaningless.

												Not bad at all.  I was actually pleasantly surprised by this game.  I'm not sure what I was expecting, but what I got was a well-fleshed out single player RPG with a very Blizzard-esque art style.  The combat is active and lively, the progression is deep, and exploration is rich.  Story is a weak point, but otherwise it's hard to find fault in this one.  I'd give it a go if you're in the market to sink a fair amount of time into an active combat RPG.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is fantastic. It's one of the best action RPGs to date and still better than most newer games coming out today. It's an incredibly large, open world with a rich storyline and fast, fun gameplay.Pros+ Fast paced action+ Great animations and special effects+ Hundreds of quests to do+ Huge, intricate areas+ Beautiful graphics+ Interesting Ability and Destiny system+ Can make whatever kind of fighter you want with many different skills and traits. You can respec easily, too.+ Wide variety of weapons, armor, and their respective customizations+ Crafting is simple and efficient+ Very smooth gameplayCons- Bad lip syncronizations and weird facial expressions- Shifting polygons on distant terrain as you approach- Camera is too close and that's bad during combat. It also has a mind of it's own at times.- ""Stale air"" in the towns. They don't feel like towns to me. It's wierd.- Can only map 4 spells on the controller- MANY different terms, people, and locations mentioned throughout the game but no in-game glossary for referencing- I personally don't like the map-  Very annoying sound controls. Sound Effect volume affects dialogue, instead of Dialogue Volume doing it. Poor sound equalization.8.5/10			",59,6,0,18,0,0,2

												One of the best RPG design I have seen. The best is the combat with the evolution of the character, very impressive and with good control. Very very big but easy to learn. I also like the history and the setting. Very good graphics and better if you use SweetFX and Nvidia inspector.Just one thing, is too easy so PLEASE use the Ysa mod, search in the forums, it makes the game HARD. Read about the mod, is very customizable, if you don't want a overhelming difficulty, to me the most important thing are:  - Reduced EXP - Reduced Fate Points - Reduced Gold; They don't add a real difficulty, just the thing is to not overlevel everything, not use everytime the fate easy mode and make gold have an actual value.Is the thing most close I have found to Dark Souls, and you know, Dark Souls is one of the best game I have played.

Though I cant exactly do It justice. just try out the Demo.			",95,37,1,10,3,2,4

												I'm fairly deep into the game so far.  It's very addicting.  There are some cons in terms of some of the graphics, but these honestly don't detract from the game at all.  It's very immersing and it's easy to play for hours without realizing it.  Unlike most RPGs with multiple races (Skyrim and the like, for example), whatever race you select at the beginning doesn't impact your development in the long run; they're all at an even playing field to start out.  None have any real strengths or obvious weaknesses; you can select whichever one of the four you want and not have to worry if they're going to be weaker in melee style or stealth style or whatever your preferred style is.  Using kb&m works just fine, so I have no comments as to whether a controller is any better or worse.  One other possible downside is that you need to keep a close eye on your weaponry and armor.  Depending on what you're fighting or how much fighting you're doing, your weapons (and armor to a lesser degree) will get damaged pretty quickly.  The system warns you when your weapon is close to breaking (permanently), so you'll have to use a repair kit or switch it out before it shatters.  Armor (including your shield, robes, etc) holds up pretty well.  There are a variety of destinites to choose from and you don't have to stay with one in particular; I actually recommend that you change around as more get unlocked as you level-up.  The game allows for a variety of styles without difficulty; you're not stuck with what you have and so you don't have to start over to change something.  You can see a Fateweaver to change your fate, but I've yet to see the necessity in doing that.I will say this about the difficulty levels of the game: hard/difficult mode is the way to go.  I'll admit to having some trouble with the normal mode in most other RPGs, but even KOA's difficult mode isn't overly challenging.  I rarely fateshift unless I'm coming up against a foe I just can't figure out how to beat, or if I don't have enough health potions.  Levelling up is pretty easy compared to other games.  It's a very entertaining game and it being a little easier in terms of foes allows for better exploration, in my opinion.  I have been doing the side quests and faction quests as I go rather than coming back to them, but it doesn't seem to matter how you do it.  That being said, I'm sure I'm progressing slower than others might, and I've got a ways to go before actually completing the game (I've put the main quests on hold for the moment to do some exploring in areas I've not been to).

												Kingdoms of Amalur is an amazing open world RPG with a wonderful story.  There are dozens of side quests across the game which propel you out into the world and encourage you to explore its extremely rich lore.  The game itself has a huge draw with its very personal customization of your characters skills through the ability to pull from more than one skill type.  On top of that the smithing, alchemy, and sagecrafting allow you to make armor, weapons, potions and gems to enhance your playstyle.  All in all this game is a must play for anyone interested in story driven RPG with countless hours of play time, and huge amounts of replay ability.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												PROS- Huge Map (with much needed fast travel)- Environment is solid- Combat is simple enough- Ability to switch classes/ mix classes/ at will without losing game progress- Crafting gear/weapons- Decent variety of enemies CONS- Character customization limited- No mounts- Difficulty is waaaaaaaaaaaay too easy even on hard (do yourself a favor and avoid crafting gear or weapons)- Story ... I mean i really wanted to put this as a pro, and I REALLY TRYED to listen to all the conversations and not skip them. But I mean come on, at maybe 25% game completion I was falling asleep during the conversations. Then when you get to a new town and you see all the NPCs with about 8 dialogues a piece my reaction was like OH $*** here we go again...All in all a great game would recommend and for the price of $5 or less you can't beat it.10/10 ...

												Lackluster. They borked their camera and prevent you from seeing a lot of the hard work they put into the visual design. The story is freaking hoaky. Nothing interesting. The whole fate thing has been done to death by the Japanese, come on man.The gameplay is a mixed bag, the quests suck. They're MMO quests in a single player RPG, not cool. The combat how ever is alright, though given how big the environments are they could have gone a lot more nuts with it, buy what ever. Combat gets an A.I can't recommend this game for anything other than a quick sale buy. I really hope someone takes the ideas from it and makes something presentable.			",685,152,22,97,92,2,108

												Have you ever played an MMORPG and felt, ""oh gosh, I wish there was no once else but me and the NPC's around here""? Then this game is right up your alley.  This game is right down to the core an offline MMORPG. You get tons of trash armor, there's something that reminds of dungeons, kill and fetch quests everywhere and as much action in the gameplay as you would expect of an MMORPG. While the overworld have some pretty places to look at, you rarely get much of a chance to do so since you spend most of your time inside somewhere.Positive:+ Combat is responsive when dodging and there's nice hit detection when hitting an enemy+ The armor is the game looks good+ Overworld is pretty and there's a lot to look at+ If you dig deep there's can be some fun character buildsNegative:- Using shields in combat is absolutely unresponive and awful- The amount of trash equipment you get makes it a chore to find anything. You spend more time going through trash than you do comparing which weapon to use- Questing is VERY overwhelming in this game. You get quest, on quest, on quest, on quest.- Questing is completely uninspired. If you've ever played an MMORPG you probably have experience with the kinds of quest you get in this game.- They don't put much effort into getting you interested in the story, which is needed in this game since you get so many story side-quests. Sometimes you end up doing a quest and out nowhere find out it was apparently a huge part to the main story, but unless you're really reading and listening to every single NPC on the way you won't get anything from it.- I played over 10 hours and not a single hint of a mount of any kind. Wouldn't even be a little surprised if at least 5 hours of my gameplay time has been just running from dungeon to dungeon and city to city just to get filled with quests. Some cities only exists to give you quests.- Overworld, while pretty, feels very empty. You get the feeling of playing a dead MMORPG everywhere and it just stops the world from feeling alive at all.With all of this said, you might find some enjoyment if you really enjoy making original character builds and mess around with that. But if you're anything like me and just enjoy some classic warrior action this game is going to bore you to tears and you're better off with Guild Wars 2, which actually is an MMORPG with an alive world and have fluid combat as well.Only buy this game if you're starving for some wRPG action.

												It's a good game. Anyways you will be killing the same damned monsters from the beginning of the game to the end of the game, it's absolutely ridicoulous, there are like 6/7 types of monsters so let's repeat the killing again and again and again.The good part is the character evolution. You can upgrade your champion in many different ways...A good game for 6$ but it would have a lot of potential with other monster types			",47,1,7,1,5,0,4

												Great little gem I had never heard anything about. Bought it on a whim and it was worth every dollar. Nothing revolutionary but I love how you can fine tune the combat to your style considering I love being a Jack-of-all-Trades player and often times a player is penalized for it. The world is large enough that it was occasionally a bother to get from one place to another but for me it adds to the immersion, but not too large that you'll waste all your time wandering it or having to fast travel from one place to the other exclusively. The writing, quests and options available to you are all well done with relatively few bugs. Only bug I found was a quest where you had to get an item from a character and rather than kill him I stole it, game didn't like that so I killed him, then it didn't count the item in my inventory but I couldn't grab something he didn't have at that point. Slightly annoying but if that's the only issue I had I'll give it two big thumbs up.			",67,19,0,34,36,0,20

												What an amazing game! It's so weird it's not mentioned often when talking about RPGs. This game should be in top 3 atleast!The game is huge, there's tons and tons and tons of things to do. The storylines are fun and easy to follow (even for me, who usually doesn't care about stories too much). The scenery is simply stunning, there's so many different areas and regions and each with a different style. The combat is fantastic, so many different paths to follow and builds to make. I'm sure there's something out there for all of you.The only downside is that it's abit easy but then again, I'm not a fan of games that get so hard that makes me want to throw my pc out the window.Would I recommend this? Yes, absolutely. 10/10			",88,8,1,11,1,0,3

												While many seem to think Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning as a poor game (Just google its name and prepare for the hate!) it has a great storyline with a lot of action, quite a few twists and a truly unique setting.In the world of Amalur, all living thing has a destiny, a fate. And all follow it, even if they don't know they do. Fateweavers, people who study fate for years, can see its threads and as such can tell someone else's, or their own, fate. Wether anouncing to a prisoner his imminent and unexpected release or telling a young man he will die in his prime due to an accident, what a fateweaver sees always holds true. For no one is above fate itself. No one but you. Yep, you read that right! The player character in Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a recently diseased person brought back to life through certain experiments and their recent return to the land of the living makes them fateless. Supposed to be dead, fate holds nothing more for you. Soon, and without knowing this, you are sent to see a fateweaver. Not remembering your past life, you hope he can bring you answers. What a shock when you get there to discover that not only does fate not affect you, but YOU in fact affect fate itself! Your actions, as they are fateless, are purely up to you, and nobody can predict them. Because of this, you can change anything: Kill someone and the fate of their whole family, or even of the whole land, might change. Save someone else and a family supposed to disapear might survive and go on to do great things. Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is truly a great game which I found myself getting lost in for hours on end, trying different types of characters and gameplay, having fun simply wandering around. And if you think combat is a little boring, try to sneak-kill everything you can, I can promise that up the difficulty! And I haven't even talked about the DLCs, which brings even more fun to this party!All in all, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a great game, filled to the brim with fun and free roaming, loads of side quests which are all interesting, and characters whom have their own lives, relations and problems. Definetly worth every penny... Now what are you waiting for? Play the game and write your own fate!			",117,7,0,21,4,0,12

												It's a pretty standard Fantasy Action Game experience - you pick from a couple of Totally Unique Racial Categories, make some basic cosmetic changes (hair, skin tone, etc.) and then you go smash the crap out of things.Character progression is somewhat reminiscent of Torchlight with a bit of The Witcher for good measure.  You can ""multiclass"" between Tough Smashy Style, Sneaky Stabby Style, and Explody Magic Style.The lore is more-or-less your standard fantasy novel business - there's good (not-)elves and bad (not-)elves and the bad (not-)elves are going HAM on your homeland.  Good thing you're a Chosen One and can stand up to those naughty naughty (not-)elves!  Did we mention that you have a Mysterious Past that you have to uncover?  Of course you do.It's going to be tainted by comparison to Skyrim, as they're both Epic Fantasy Smashy Smash games.  Skyrim excels in having a truly open world (much of KOA is pretty much linear - the old invisible fence is full in effect here) and near-limitless modification capacity.  KOA excels at having a much more enjoyable combat system - lots of fancy combos and trick moves.  There's a ""rage meter"" mechanic that's kind of neat in a silly ""Mortal Kombat"" way - you charge up your murders and then you go into Super Murder Mode, where you get, of all things, a quicktime event where you have to mash buttons to Extra Super Duper Murder someone for bonus XP.It's silly, even for Epic Fantasy Gaming, but it's probably worth snagging on sale.

So no one played it because everyone was too busy slaying dragons and knocking bears off cliffs with their voice.  They really missed out. This was a fantastic game.The only downside I thought was the loot system. The loot system is random, so if you are trying to complete a set you better just hope you have good luck.

												A tiny bit of it is unpolished but if you can see past that, you will find an amazingly fun and addictive game. It's like god of war mixed with a really fun RPG that allows you to pick your upgrades from 3 trees (Stealth, Fighter, Mage) and allows you to mix the trees up, the only limit is the number of points you have to spend and the level requirement for that tier, as well as the occassional pre-requisite to have an upgrade from an earlier tier to be in your repitoire before you can unlock a later tier upgrade in that tree. There is a main storyline, but the side quests are a blast and are littered throughout each map. You'll want to hit up the DLC content around level 9 or 10 due to the gear that drops being for level 1 through 18. The enemies are gorgeous to look at while you come up with awesome new combos or ways to kill them, and the view of your surroundings is beautiful in most levels. One of the most beautiful places to visit are the caverns with the all the glowing effects and magical sprites floating about, really nice to look at.  Don't forget to check out the arena in the desert and battle your way to new gear and other rewards. So many things to do and see in this game, it will keep you enthralled for a good 50 hours at least. Add in a couple of playthroughs to explore each area fully and see the different reactions to another race choice and you have well over 100 hours of hard core RPG/action to fall in love with. Each enemy is crafted with such tiny details, my favorite is the one with the wood mask facade for a face that opens up to reveal some really sharp and evil looking teeth and glowing eyes atop a gaping mouth. So many details in the architecture make each area you visit a wonder to behold as you walk around just soaking in the view that the extremely talented artists rendered. I really wish there were more games like this. Just like with the Elder Scrolls and Fallout worlds, i could spend months in here and never feel bored.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A good game with tons of content.  If you're a completionist like me, you'll put 100 hours into this easily.  The art style is kind of WoW-ey but that has allowed it to age well.  It's challenging without being artifically difficult, and the DLC adds a lot of content.  Pretty standard plot, you're a special guy/gal that needs to save the world from ancient evil.  But if you like exploring a (mostly) non-linear world and killing baddies for loot, it's a good game and certainly worth the time.			",112,41,0,37,0,0,7

												7/10   This open world single player frpg is no Skyrim(what else is?), but it has the potential to engross you for many hours if you like this type of game.  The game suffers a bit from feeling like it was a template for an MMO more than being designed strictly as a single player frpg.  PROs+Lots of content -- skills, items, quests, zones+Action combat+Open world (sort of)+Fully voiced NPCs+No significant bugs encountered+Fate weaving was an interesting game mechanicCONs-No jump key-Narrow zones in lieu of a true open world-Cartoony graphics reminiscent of WoW.  Low polygons with vibrant coloring-Mildly annoying inventory management, (mostly)mitigated by fast travel. and an in game stash-A little slow at first+/-  The lore in the game was fairly deep, but I personally did not find the lore(or story for that matter) particularly compelling.  ymmv.+/-  Not particularly difficult.  Some may say too easy.  Conclusion:  Holy crap,did you really read everything to this point?   cough....  If you are between AAA games, can find this on sale, and have a hankering for a big single player frpg, this may be a game you should try.			",188,21,0,35,7,2,33

												This is an amazing little gem, it has all of the characteristics of an early Skyrim but it is simple enough to play, I would recommend this game because of the playability which is second to none.  Its really easy to pick up and you can play to how you prefer to play it in terms of fighting style, there are 3 base classes to choose from, which in turn, each have a complex tree of varying combinations of classes.  The world you play in is a very vibrant one, full of colour and texture.  There is alchemy, blacksmithing, you can upgrade certain weapons and armor and best of all, for all lovers of RPG's, there's plenty of loot.  Money is scarce at first but after a dozens missions or so under your belt and you will see how quickly your money can build up.  You can level up your character, choose as you will because you can always change completely at anytime by visiting Fateweavers who will, for price, reset your levels so that you can rebuild to a different style.

												I will openly admit that I had absolutely no intention originally of ever picking this game up... until it went on sale majorly discounted (Thank you, Steam!) and a friend told me to just give it a shot. I have to say, I rather enjoy it very much and I am kicking myself for not giving it a shot before. The artstyle for this is what hit me first. It has such a bright and colorful atmosphere while still being able to be dark when it needs to be. I find myself looking around each and every new area I visit rather thuroughly and not being disappointed in the least. The designs of the characters, items and equipment are also very unique and the fact that Todd McFarlane had his hands in it really shows.It has a story that really draws you in and it has such an ambiguous morality meter that you really feel your impacts on the world. the gameplay is just as fun and addictive as well adding a unique combo and weapon swap ability that just works and the magic use itself is spectacular. It is not without it's faults though as I found the quests themselves rather repetative. Other than that, it is definitely worth the full price that it is. :) 8.5/10			",275,95,2,54,25,1,31

												Linear RPG with a great fighting mechanic, many dialogues and tons of quests. It's fantastic ripping the enemies apart with twohand-greatswords, assassin blades or hammers. Especially the chakhrams do just ROCK! You can feel the impact of the weapons. The character advancement  with skill points and ablities is great, too. Loots of loot, lots of quests, lots of fights. This game has it's flaws but it is worth a walkthrough.8 of 10 form me.			",212,37,10,26,24,5,32

												This is an amazing game. The combat is satisfying and fantastic, the story is interesting, and the universe is intriguing once you get into it. The downsides to the game include less good character models, and the graphics aren't Skyrim level. I would, however, put this game above Skyrim in the categories of combat and stability. The game world is huge, but the game itself runs extremely smoothly and I have yet to run into a glitch.My friends who enjoy a good RPG gaming experience, this should be on your list.

												Six hours into the game and I really like it so far. Playing it feels like having an adventure in the Warcraft universe with Fable gameplay. The world and the range of quests is big enough to get your money's worth - you just have to overlook the MMO-like style of the majority of missions (go there, get that, fight this, come back) and the tubular area design. I really enjoy the graphic style - as I said, it really reminds me of the Warcraft franchise. The game's environmental design is full of variety (unfortunately, the enemies are not) and really nice to look at. You just have to look up to see the game's beauty, because the standard camera angle is somewhat pointed downwards for some reason. I can't say too much about the story yet, but even though it is that classic ""chosen one saves kingdom against all odds"" scenario, you realise pretty soon that it is rather well written and in accord with the atmospheric world.The game's difficulty can be adjusted at any time. I started on ""hard"" since a friend told me that it was too easy. I had a fairly challanging run until I got some better gear, which made most fights beside boss-battles pretty redundant. On the other side,I think the difficulty really depends on the zone you are in, so don't let this repel you too much.I play it with a controller and it works fine. The camera is a little tardy but that is all I can complain about right now.All in all, you notice really soon that, even though this is a whole new franchise, experienced minds were working on this title.It is a worthwhile, light fantasy experience (having the three classic classes to choose from, or just fusion two/three of them) with a really nice graphical style (in my opinion at least). Recommended for fans of the Fable series or people that are looking for a game of this kind in a Warcraft-like setting. Worth the price if you put some time in to it, and definitely worth the money when on sale. 7.5/10 ",141,34,2,26,14,2,23

												So far, I've only played about 2-3hrs~ worth, but I can guarantee that this is an amazing game. It is a more robust 'Fable-esque' RPG with MMO canon combined with it. From gathering materials to dungeon crawling combat, Studio 38 was able to combine all the innovative features, mechanics and aspects of most Fantasy-franchises while still holding true to an original concept.I must say I had no expectations of this game nor did I hear anything about it when it was released, but I look forward to playing it some more. I also didn't get the DLC, but I'm sure that it's just as good as the base-game. Plus, I managed to make a character look like Jennifer Lawrence, 10/10.			",305,65,4,32,16,2,32

												Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning delivers exactly what it promises: a pitch-perfect fantasy RPG, with visceral, intuitive gameplay that is easy to pick up, difficult to master, wildly flexible and just plain fun, in a way that has yet to be seen in the genre. The world is accessible and vast, offering genre fans plenty to sink their teeth into. One gets the sense that they are watching an entire world unfold before them, one rich with history and lore and life. Amalur opens itself up to the player in a way that is both familiar and refreshing, then empowers the player to do incredible things. 38 Studios and Big Huge Games have created a world worth saving, and they have given us some pretty damn cool tools with which to get the job done.

												Imagine a world, where life holds no suprises, because the gods have planned out your fate to the detail: what you will accomplish, how you live, how you die...In this game, everyone is bound to their fate - except for you... Resurrected by a magic device, the ""Well of Souls"", you quickly discover that you have no fate at all, you are not part of the gods grand plan... which makes you the variable that can change everything.Where you intervene, nothing is certain anymore.This is the scenario that awaits you in Kingdoms of Amalur.Before I purchased this game, I had never even heared of it, but it became one of my favorite games very quickly.The world in this game might not be the biggest I have ever seen, yet it is a pretty huge world to explore, filled with lots and lots of quests besides the pretty nice main story.And of course there is the character development - for me personally the most important part of a game.In this game, your fate is in your hands... You want to be a mighty warrior, whose battlecry makes enemies tremble in fear, a powerful mage, who unleashes the forces of nature or a stealthy Rogue, who takes out his enemies with one swift backstab? No problem. Or do you prefer to be Battlemage, Rogue-Sorcerer or maybe a little bit of everything? Also no problem, because in this game you can distribute your points freely in any of 3 skill trees (Might, Finesse, Sorcery).9 different weapon classes offer you a pretty nice arsenal to crush those, who are foolish enough to stand in your way.The combat system is very fluent and the battles are always a sight to see, no matter if you backstab, swing the hammer or let thunder rain down on your enemies, but once you killed a few and collected their fate energy, it gets really cool.Once your fatemeter is full, you can enter the reckoning mode, where time is slowed down for everything but you and your powers increase tremendously. When you brought them to their knees, you can fateshift the enemies, which means you are getting a pretty nice finishing move.Overall I have to say, I did not find much wrong with this game at all.

												This game is really good. The graphics have that sort of fantasy vibe to it, although it's not really at a good resolution. I'm not sure how you change the resolution either. There doesn't seem to be any graphics options that let you change it. That's very bad. Very very bad. My monitor is a 1680x1050 and it looks a bit washed out with this resolution. I can still play it, but I just wish I could change some of the graphics options.Edit: Upon further inspection, the only time you can change the graphics options are in the main menu. The gameplay is pure hack-and-slash fun. Think of games like Darksiders. That is kind of this game (minus the epic areial combos). This game is also a loot-fest. You get new equipment very frequently (if you take the time to explore). All the weapons are really fun to use and have different strengths and weaknesses to them, like the daggers being the fast and low-damage type, hammers which are the slow but hard-hitting type, typical etc. etc.. You also can do numerous special moves that you unlock with each weapon type. You also have this fate weaving ability (forgot what it was called) where you press and hold the triggers (or the keyboard equivalent) to slow down time and kill your enemies faster and impale them to death with large energy spears...Hmm. Yes. Overall, very fun and engaging combat.The story is alright, it's not cliche, but it's nothing to write home about. You are basically the vitcim of a war, and you have died. Yes, you heard me right. You died. But don't fret, something called the well of life resurrected you. I don't really know anything else because I most likely have forgotten. The voice acting is also quite good. Not Skyrim levels, but still it's not gut wrenchingly bad.The only thing that I would have had improved is the user interface. The inventory system feels very cluttered and since your items are featured on one page in a sort of list structure, albiet seperated in categories, it's hard to navigate. I wish they would've shown all of your items on the single screen instead of having to scroll down to see which new items you have acquired, or want to equip, etc. Also the camera kind of sucks, it's very close sometimes, and then sometimes it's further away.Overall, I like this game and would reccommend anyone who likes games like Skyrim or Darksiders to pick this up. Though not at full price.			",428,64,3,43,40,4,17

												Really a shame what happened with the devs, this is an extremely good ARPG with only some small issues - narrow field of view and a crafting system that takes a hot second to get used to.That being said, the game itself has at least 70-80 hours of content outside of DLCs if you explore, and the achievements definitely incentivize exploring. You can switch up your character at will when you find better loot - and better loot you will find - in a ton of different ways, with all kinds of different hybrid playstyles being viable and fun alternatives to ther norm.The takedowns in Reckoning mode are flashy, the executions from stealth are super satisfying... And for 6$ every other week it's embarrassing not to own a game with this much quality content by now.			",187,54,2,28,15,2,9

												A tiny bit of it is unpolished but if you can see past that, you will find an amazingly fun and addictive game. It's like god of war mixed with a really fun RPG that allows you to pick your upgrades from 3 trees (Stealth, Fighter, Mage) and allows you to mix the trees up, the only limit is the number of points you have to spend and the level requirement for that tier, as well as the occassional pre-requisite to have an upgrade from an earlier tier to be in your repitoire before you can unlock a later tier upgrade in that tree. There is a main storyline, but the side quests are a blast and are littered throughout each map. You'll want to hit up the DLC content around level 9 or 10 due to the gear that drops being for level 1 through 18. The enemies are gorgeous to look at while you come up with awesome new combos or ways to kill them, and the view of your surroundings is beautiful in most levels. One of the most beautiful places to visit are the caverns with the all the glowing effects and magical sprites floating about, really nice to look at.  Don't forget to check out the arena in the desert and battle your way to new gear and other rewards. So many things to do and see in this game, it will keep you enthralled for a good 50 hours at least. Add in a couple of playthroughs to explore each area fully and see the different reactions to another race choice and you have well over 100 hours of hard core RPG/action to fall in love with. Each enemy is crafted with such tiny details, my favorite is the one with the wood mask facade for a face that opens up to reveal some really sharp and evil looking teeth and glowing eyes atop a gaping mouth. So many details in the architecture make each area you visit a wonder to behold as you walk around just soaking in the view that the extremely talented artists rendered. I really wish there were more games like this. Just like with the Elder Scrolls and Fallout worlds, i could spend months in here and never feel bored.			",221,38,3,52,11,1,21

												So, my first taste of this game was back on the Xbox 360 as a demo. At the time, I believed it to be what Fable should have been. I continue this sentiment. This game is atrociously underrated, and it's a tragedy that it will never receive a sequel (the company that made it went bankrupt shortly after its release). It isn't a perfect game. Like most RPGs, it has some less-than-inspired quests. Moreover, the combat system can be a bit repetitive, and the character models are recycled to no end. However, it is filled with some surprisingly deep lore, and I had a grand time playing it over the summer. It is also surprisingly long for an original IP. Overall, I'd give it between an 8 and 9 out of 10.			",136,31,0,24,4,0,7

A cohesive narrative and vibrant visuals bring the world of Amalur to life.As I glance through some other user reviews I see a lot of positive comparisons to some of the leaders of the RPG genre: Skyrim, Guild Wars 2, Fable, Diablo and Torchlight. Personally I saw the closest resemblance to World of Warcraft with its visuals and questing system. However, this is no clone of a game. It has a unique identity that, in part, is made from borrowing successful traits from these other titles. What stands out most strongly to me about Kingdoms of Amalur is its narrative and world lore. It presents fresh ideas and throughout my 95+ hours (including 210 quests completed) with the game it always felt consistent, like the developers shared a unified vision of what they wanted this world to be.Without discussing any specific plot points, I'll say that things begin on a high note and intrigued me right off the bat with a mystery surrounding who this character you are playing as is. It is a special feat in my mind to be able to have a personalized, voiceless protagonist that you are expected to project yourself into also have a predetermined, very interesting back story of their own. Too often these types of characters are just a boring blank slate. My sense of progression through this world was wonderful. Your journey begins far from a major warzone and consequently you merely hear stories about it. As you advance closer you begin to see more immediate effects like sons and daughters gone off to fight or altered local economies. Eventually you'll see large refugee camps causing overcrowding problems and burned down towns before reaching the warfront itself. By and large, the settings you visit along the way stand apart from each other both visually and in local story. The exceptions to this are some of the dungeons that look and play very similarly, just with different layouts and quest objectives to fulfill. For a game already so big I think it would have benefited from cutting some of them out.All dialogue is voice acted and of good quality. There is some noticeable reuse of voice actors among NPCs, but that is excusable for a game of this size. I would rather see good voice actors reused than bad voice actors brought in in greater numbers.Combat, unfortunately, is just adequate. There isn't enough depth here to stay compelling throughout. There is a nice mix of weapon types that all control very differently, but you're likely to pick one or two early on and stick with them. Magic brings some cool spells to the fray but are very limited in number. Leveling up is a good, customizable system that does gradually add new abilities, but not enough to keep things from going stale. To be clear, I never got to a point of hating battles. However, a combination of things getting too easy by the end, the long length of the game and repetition of enemy types eventually sucked a lot of the enjoyment out of it. I will warn you that it is possible to become over leveled if you do all side quests as you find them. Google ""Amalur Wiki overlevel"" to find a guide for avoiding this.I'll wrap things up with a few more minor critiques. Loot is dealt out in such volume that inventory management becomes a chore (similar to many Diabloesque games). Despite this abundance of gear it was surprisingly infrequent how often I found something better than what I was wearing. Also, before long I had more money than things to do with it. I play most games on Normal difficulty, including this one, but didn't find enough challenge here so I suggest playing on Hard to most players. The orchestral score was competently produced but lacked the artistry to make it memorable.Overall, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a fantastic, expansive experience that could have benefited from seeing its great length reined in a little bit.

												Fantastic game. Not as polished as some other RPG's out there, but I believe this is due to lack of funding. If you enjoy RPG's at all, I highly recommend this one. Tons of content. I pretty much skipped 90% of the side/faction quests and proceeded along the main storyline, took ~40hr to complete. There are supposedly an additional 400 or so side/faction quests in the game. The map is huge as well. Larger than some MMO maps. The storyline is decent. The fighting mechanics are a blast. Protip: do NOT start pure sorcery. It gets boring quick. My advice is to start with might or finesse and then play around with sorcery later on if it strikes your fancy. You can respec on a whim.			",341,79,3,48,24,1,47

												So I heard this game was a massive flop, and that made me dubious about picking it up, but the sale this weekend was too much to pass on, and I grabbed it. 10 hours or so in now and I honestly can't see why this wasn't game of the year 2012. It's like someone took the combat from Fable, made it actually good and moderately challenging, and then took the idea of massive open environments to explore, chucked some sick Briton mythology in there for giggles and then wrapped it up with some top tier writing and dialogue. The best way I can think of describing it would be if The Elder Scrolls and Fable had a baby, and it was ♥♥♥♥ing amazing, with the sick quests of Oblivion and Morrowind combined with the combat style of Fable, but made way deeper and with enemies that aren't completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Basically if you took all the disappointment from Skyrim and Fable 3, and made the opposite.I mean sure, it ain't Dark Souls if you're looking for something super hard, but many of the fights I've already encountered would wreck you if you did them wrong.

												If you think this game like Skyrim. You come to the wrong place.Why everyone tell this game like skyrim? Just because Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion lead designer Ken Rolston is a developer of this game. After that? Nothing similar to skyrim.If you come here to play game that similar to skyrim. Don't buy this game. You can buy another games that similar to Skyrim.Open World in this game is suck. Not a sandbox game like skyrim.Quest is suck too. It's like MMORPG but offline.But, i recommend this game because the Combat. Well.. The combat in this game is fun.Well.. This is my opinion. Sorry for bad english(:			",112,27,5,17,5,1,7

												Kingdoms of Amalur combines everything I love about role playing games with a hint of fighting with combos from games of my youth. I love the music, game-play and the lore. I find this game highly addictive, with instant gratification and flexible play style. I would reccommend this game for any players looking for a fresh RPG.			",99,23,2,29,15,0,23

												Game feels like a MMORPG but single player. The gameplay is nice, never get tired of it. Graphic isn't the best but understandable, however the landscape are something you can really look at and be like wow. But as we all know the feel of a MMORPG game with ""Kill and Collect X items"" quest gets boring over time when it's repetitive. The main storyline is short, but there are tons of side/faction quest that you can do which will add more hours of gameplay.Overall Rating: 8/10Hit: GameplayMiss: Quest (too repetitive)			",64,11,0,7,2,1,8

												Solid old fashioned RPG fun.That's the description I keep thinking about all the time I've been playing. In fact I'm having too much fun to admit this game has flaws - which it definitely does but I just don't care. Because there's that itch and it's being thoroughly scratched, and if you need proof just start counting how many times I'm about to use the word fun. ;) And if counting isn't your thing, there is an actual demo (shocking, I know), so ignore me and try the game yourself. So why is it fun? Being able to mix and match any class you can come up with is fun. Respeccing anytime you feel like it (for a fee) is fun. The loot is good, diverse and stays interesting. Exploration is very much rewarded. And alone these elements mean: ""I just found an interesting legendary item in a chest behind a weird crevice that I had no reason to go to, but it's not for my build. Let me respec for a moment and try it out"". And that's just fun. :) This game gets compared to Skyrim a lot (and trashed for that reason), but it does combat, classes and abilities so much better than Skyrim. For starters, the combat is actually entertaining. Gets a bit on the easy side if you hunt down the side quests, but it feels satisfying and enjoyable - neither unnecessarily complex nor simple button mashing. There is no huge enemy diversity, but what there is gets the job done in forcing you to try different tactics. Stealth and ranged are rather disadvantaged systems because of how often enemies mob you, but magic is really well done, sword play and daggers are fun, and some of the more interesting weapons, like the middle-range chakrams and the faeblades, have been given a lot of love. In fact all classes and class mixes work well (stealthy assassins aside), which doesn't happen often enough in RPGs, so feel free to create the weirdest mix you ever came up with.The crafting systems don't reinvent the wheel but they are both intuitive to use and deep enough: The alchemy is useful and the experimenting process works well, blacksmithing admittedly becomes a bit obsolete on higher levels, and gem crafting is more or less what you'd expect, but still helpful with later game weapons.The map is big without feeling unmanageable, and there's a lot of game there: many side quests, some with follow ups, much to discover if you just run down a random path in the forest, long main quests and a decent number of mostly smaller dungeons that manage not to be too boring. So length-wise this is a fair value for money proposition, but it's also not so long that it overstays its welcome.I'm also really enjoying the story, but it won't be for everyone. If you ever read anything by R.A. Salvatore (Drizzt from Forgotten Realms, DemonWars, etc) you will know what to expect: Pulp, generic fantasy, with occasional interesting flashes, decent if not overly original world-building and lore, a ""working writer's"" kind of prose, but rather enjoyable nonetheless - if you like that kind of stuff. Personally I am loving it, but the disclaimer remains. Just don't expect real choices or fancy dialog trees.All in all, there's not too much to complain about. There are the occasional problems with weird camera angles, the way maps deal with over-/underpasses can be annoying, and that dispelling rythm mini-game you have to use to unlock some chests was a really bad design idea. But those are just pet peeves. I encountered no weird bugs or crashes, the game runs smoothly on a low to mid range computer, and the UI is workable. Both controller and mouse/keyboard played fine for me, so pick your poison.So in case you still didn't get my memo, Kindoms of Amalur is simply fun to play. :) If you like traditional crpgs with a bit of an MMO aroma (just without the pesky other humans around), ignore the horrible name and give the demo a try.

												A lot of people passed this game up on launch, and it's a shame they did. Because this game is very good. The combat is relatively simple at first, but as you keep playing, you quickly gain new skills. And the ability to mix things up with class mixing easily allows the player to try out new things. While the gameplay becomes much easier as you keep playing, it still manages to maintain a degree of challenge, often forcing the player to mix up their stratagies and spells. Even magic, which is broken in most other games, is just as balanced as an assassin or warrior. Furthermore, the story is wonderful. I won't spoil it, but it's great. Like it turns the basic RPG on it's head.			",130,14,1,6,2,1,3

												This is one of those underrated games that got overshadowed by Skyrim because they came out around the same time, and the company was pretty new and unknown. But there are major differences between Kingdoms and Skyrim most noteably, Kingdoms doesn't freeze, get lost, or crash like Skyrim does, especially the xbox version. HOWEVER this game was made for Windows 7, and the company didn't survive, which stinks btw... so there are crashes on Windows 10. Every time I tried to play this game on W10 it did crash after about 15 minutes of play, and others have said the same...so if you don't run Windows 7...you may want to pass on this one, even though it is a really great game.Kingdoms is really well written, engaging, and fun to explore. The map is huge, AND most importantly, its easy to follow. There are a lot of cool features like  dispel chests which are challenging to unlock but hold a lot of valuable stuff in them. Although learning to open them can be a real pain in the fanny because if you fail, you suffer health loss, but they will still be unlocked. There are chests to find, tons of them...and lore stones that when you find and activate them, they reveal narration of the backstory. There is a lot going for this game, it's visually beautiful, reminiscent of Fable, but also holds its own original story and style, and great music, and so is the voice acting. The combat is fun with lots of weapons, spells, etc, to aid you. But the best feature of this game is the combat because it doesn't require the player to be at a high level before they get powerful weapons and spells. You get that pretty darn early so that is a plus in my book. There are 3 game difficulty levels, and several races to choose and build your character from male and female. Human and other.I have logged about 90 hours on this game  (mostly offline not recorded by Steam)... and I still haven't finished everything. There are a ton of side quests but not necessary for leveling up , but can be over-whelming if you start too many at once, which is very easy to do. Basically it is open-world, however the story is linear. The character design and environments were created by Todd McFarlane (creator of Spawn) so ...you know it's great.This really is an overlooked game...but it plays very well, and you should check it out IF you run Windows 7.

												The gameplay of KoA is fantastic. A strong world of warcraft feel to the graphics allows for a smooth gameplay on a poor spec machine.On the world of warcraft note, I would like to add that the entire game feels like it was based off it. The graphocs, quests, locations and characters are all very similar to wow. That aside, there is a lot of orginality in the game, with decent voice acting, the combat system and the smithing concept.My ratings for the game:Audio: 9/10 - Ambient soundtrack was done well, allowing for smooth transitions between combat and adventuring. The voice acting was done really well. No faults in my opinion, didn't get 10/10 because I wouldn't purchase the soundtrack just to listen to it.Visual: 9/10 - As mentioned above, the visuals are smooth and familiar.Gameplay and Content: 10/10 - There is enough in game that I feel that I definately got my money's worth. I was lucky enough to catch KoA and all of it's DLC during a sale at a bargain price.Replayability: 6/10 - The different classes within the game allow for a HUGE amount of replayability. If you want to mix stealth and magic, there are classes and bonuses to suit. If you want to mix all three aspects, there are classes and bonuses for that too. If you want to focus purely on one aspect, then obviously, there are classes and bonuses for them too. The only problem is, even though I had a great time playing through once, I get bored with it quite quickly when I go to start the game again.All in all, I would definately suggest the game to other people, and have done. I would really like to see 2 player co-op brought into the game, if I'd seen that come through, I don't think I would have to buy another game on steam ever again!			",184,28,3,37,16,0,12

												Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a colossal and deep RPG with a beautiful atmosphere.The world you can explore is huge, even though it is parted into many little regions which are designed rather linear. However, this makes it easier to find every quest and not to miss something important. There are tons of caves, cities, castles and forests  that are enjoyable to explore. Besides, you can fast-travel to any location you have visited so far, which is a great tool.There are three skilltrees in which you can invest , you do not have to limit your points to one of them. You can mix them up in any way you want to. You will encounter several fateweavers in the game which can reset your skill points for a bit some money, depending on your level. The level cap in this game is 40.The story itself is pretty cool and presented very well but gets a bit lengthy towards the end, yet the ending itself is spectacular again. There are several moments where you can influence certain outcomes with your decisions.There is a extremely large number of available side-quests in this game,  I ended up having completed around 300 of them (with both DLC’s). Some of them go with the standard pattern like finding some reagents or killing some mobs while on the other hand there are some pretty big side-quests that bring a little story on their own which are very entertaining to follow.The game has 3 difficulty-settings and I recommend you to play it on hard since it’s still pretty easy on medium as long as you’re not fighting large groups of enemies, especially towards the end when you got the best kinds of armor and weapons.There is a variety of different enemies that behave different in battle which leads to entertaining fights. The Gameplay itself is pretty good in my eyes,  especially the combats are very dynamic. The graphics are quite good for early 2012 and the world is designed with a love for detail. You’ll find many different environments that feel alive. The great music of this game strengthens the atmosphere even more.On the downside, there are some bugs in this game which will never get fixed because the studio that produced this game went bankrupt. However, most of these bugs just make some quest items being stuck in your inventory after you completed the quest or other minor things that one can oversee.In Amalur, you can acquire various houses in which you can store your items, you can even earn an own arena and a mining company which gain you money over time.There are various weapon types with different advantages and downsides which brings some additional diversity.Regarding the DLC’s, I can greatly recommend you “The Legend of Dead Kel” and “Teeth of Naros”, which both have a great storyline and add another big map part to the already huge map each. However, the “Weapons & Armor Bundle” just adds a bit of loot that falls off quite quick and in my opinion is not worth the money.All in All, I truly recommend giving Kingdoms of Amalur a try, for it a large and beautiful game with a wonderful atmosphere.P.S.: Sorry for my bad English, it’s not my native language.

												I really love this game. It's one of my favorites to play.When I first started playing it, my very first impressions were, 'ok this is nice, kind of like Skyrims poorer cousin', but the more I played the more I realized how unfair that initial thought was.The combat is very fluid, with a great feeling of impact to the hits. All the moves and spells are beautifully animated.I've gone pure warrior on my first character and can't wait to try out the pure caster role as I think it will be different and interesting to play. Rogue types are normally my least fave to play, but the combat is so enjoyable I'm even looking forward to trying that out too.Loads of side quests (I'm aiming to do all of them on my first character.)The world is huge and very nicely done. There are invisible walls but the world is very open and I don't find they get in the way so they're not something to worry about and they've included jump off points at locations where you'd need/want them.The dungeons are great fun too. Loads of loot drops and chests in dungeons and around the world. The weapons and armor are all really nicely meshed and textured as well.The only negative thing I'd say about the world is that there's something not quite right with the ...ambience? When your outside it feels like you're inside, I haven't been able to put my finger on why that is though, maybe the sounds or something. It's not game breaking, just a little weird when you first start playing, it doesn't bother me at all now.The herbing animations are beautiful, which I think shows a really nice attention to detail.The professions in general are all really good and all worth having. The only thing is when your salvaging armor and weapons it can be a bit awkward. It's fine if you only carry round stuff you have equipped and are going to salvage or sell everything else, but I 'collect' stuff, so I'm constantly having to flick back to my inventory and then back to the salvage screen to make sure I'm not salvaging anything I intended to keep. I feel if you could have salvaged directly from your junk inventory that would have been much better. But that's the only negative thing I have to say about this game at all, and overall and compared to everything else they got right, it's not at all important, just inconvenient......for me :PI enjoy this game so much that I did a search to see what other games the company had made, and was really sad to see that they went bust shortly after this game was released. This game seems to have flown 'under the radar' which is ashame since it should have kept the company in business. I'm surprised KoA is not better known than it is. I bought KoA and all the dlcs when it was on sale here at steam, but it's definitely worth it's full asking price. ",97,112,12,49,9,1,20

												Holy crap this game is fun!  Dont compare it to Skyrim or similar games and you'll be pleased...that is if you like fast paced and intense combat, deep storyline, alchemy, crafting, and great voice acting/diversion. Has a nice spread of all the RPG elements so your not doing too much of any one thing.  Reckoning is simplified in ways that makes it easy to play without getting bogged down by realistic elements such as arrow counts (which I actually like...as in Skyrim), but is very well suited for this type of game.  It was designed for simplicity and even though its open world still feels linear, but again..keeps a smooth flow and makes it easy to play without having to over think or worry about getting lost (for example). All the other reviews are true!...they did wonders for the inventory organization.  SO NICE!   Very nice story and voice acting...but does tend (for me) to feel like just one task after another, but THATS the game and means MORE XP!   Im not one for flashy combat like in Final Fantasy series, but Reckoning has a fast paced combat tied with awesome cinematics that will surely keep your blood flowing.  Breaking down the 3 core rpg classes into warrior, rogue, and mage...you are able to focus on one or multiclass into any combination...and you get bonuses based on your choosing which can change as you do.  The addition to a 'power up' state called 'reckoning' is awesome.  Once you build this charge you truly do feel like a bada$$ and enemies beware!    FUN FUN FUN....going to play it right now...cya!BUY THIS GAME WHILE STILL ON SALE!    or not....either way its worth getting!!!			",23,7,0,7,13,0,10

												R.A. Salvatore and Todd Macfarlene, and Oblivion creator have outdone themselves with this one. I have no words that can fully express how amazing this game is. It is a mix of Fable, meets Darksiders, meets god of war and open world. There is so much to do in this game and the possibilites of how to play it are endless. I highly recommend this game to anyone a fan of a great story and so many things to explore with the add-ons it just makes it bigger. Think Skyrim map x 3. I hope you all enjoy.

However, the “Weapons & Armor Bundle” just adds a bit of loot that falls off quite quick and in my opinion is not worth the money.All in All, I truly recommend giving Kingdoms of Amalur a try, for it a large and beautiful game with a wonderful atmosphere.P.S.: Sorry for my bad English, it’s not my native language.

												I really love this game. It's one of my favorites to play.When I first started playing it, my very first impressions were, 'ok this is nice, kind of like Skyrims poorer cousin', but the more I played the more I realized how unfair that initial thought was.The combat is very fluid, with a great feeling of impact to the hits. All the moves and spells are beautifully animated.I've gone pure warrior on my first character and can't wait to try out the pure caster role as I think it will be different and interesting to play. Rogue types are normally my least fave to play, but the combat is so enjoyable I'm even looking forward to trying that out too.Loads of side quests (I'm aiming to do all of them on my first character.)The world is huge and very nicely done. There are invisible walls but the world is very open and I don't find they get in the way so they're not something to worry about and they've included jump off points at locations where you'd need/want them.The dungeons are great fun too. Loads of loot drops and chests in dungeons and around the world. The weapons and armor are all really nicely meshed and textured as well.The only negative thing I'd say about the world is that there's something not quite right with the ...ambience? When your outside it feels like you're inside, I haven't been able to put my finger on why that is though, maybe the sounds or something. It's not game breaking, just a little weird when you first start playing, it doesn't bother me at all now.The herbing animations are beautiful, which I think shows a really nice attention to detail.The professions in general are all really good and all worth having. The only thing is when your salvaging armor and weapons it can be a bit awkward. It's fine if you only carry round stuff you have equipped and are going to salvage or sell everything else, but I 'collect' stuff, so I'm constantly having to flick back to my inventory and then back to the salvage screen to make sure I'm not salvaging anything I intended to keep. I feel if you could have salvaged directly from your junk inventory that would have been much better. But that's the only negative thing I have to say about this game at all, and overall and compared to everything else they got right, it's not at all important, just inconvenient......for me :PI enjoy this game so much that I did a search to see what other games the company had made, and was really sad to see that they went bust shortly after this game was released. This game seems to have flown 'under the radar' which is ashame since it should have kept the company in business. I'm surprised KoA is not better known than it is. I bought KoA and all the dlcs when it was on sale here at steam, but it's definitely worth it's full asking price. ",97,112,12,49,9,1,20

												Holy crap this game is fun!  Dont compare it to Skyrim or similar games and you'll be pleased...that is if you like fast paced and intense combat, deep storyline, alchemy, crafting, and great voice acting/diversion. Has a nice spread of all the RPG elements so your not doing too much of any one thing.  Reckoning is simplified in ways that makes it easy to play without getting bogged down by realistic elements such as arrow counts (which I actually like...as in Skyrim), but is very well suited for this type of game.  It was designed for simplicity and even though its open world still feels linear, but again..keeps a smooth flow and makes it easy to play without having to over think or worry about getting lost (for example). All the other reviews are true!...they did wonders for the inventory organization.  SO NICE!   Very nice story and voice acting...but does tend (for me) to feel like just one task after another, but THATS the game and means MORE XP!   Im not one for flashy combat like in Final Fantasy series, but Reckoning has a fast paced combat tied with awesome cinematics that will surely keep your blood flowing.  Breaking down the 3 core rpg classes into warrior, rogue, and mage...you are able to focus on one or multiclass into any combination...and you get bonuses based on your choosing which can change as you do.  The addition to a 'power up' state called 'reckoning' is awesome.  Once you build this charge you truly do feel like a bada$$ and enemies beware!    FUN FUN FUN....going to play it right now...cya!BUY THIS GAME WHILE STILL ON SALE!    or not....either way its worth getting!!!			",23,7,0,7,13,0,10

												R.A. Salvatore and Todd Macfarlene, and Oblivion creator have outdone themselves with this one. I have no words that can fully express how amazing this game is. It is a mix of Fable, meets Darksiders, meets god of war and open world. There is so much to do in this game and the possibilites of how to play it are endless. I highly recommend this game to anyone a fan of a great story and so many things to explore with the add-ons it just makes it bigger. Think Skyrim map x 3. I hope you all enjoy.

												What a great game. Everything seems right for PC, slick interface, nice organization of inventory, clear upgrades, story by renowned fantasy writer R A Salvatore, Combat is fantastic. A definite must buy for any RPG fan. And if you are at all interested in the genre, and have never played an RPG, or get turned off cause RPG's leave you lost and confused, this is your game. Provides a fantastically clear and easy to follow tutorial/intro, you will get into the game quickly and love it!!			",20,20,1,26,25,0,36

												I personally love this game and I feel like it was overshadowed by Skyrim which was released around the same time. The combat is fluid and it has a lot of interesting lore to it but it can get quite stale at times. However the end game there is basically very little to none content except if you plan to buy the DLCs. I bought this game when it was 60$ and I feel that it wasn't worth it but it's definitely a must-try for 20$ and under. Don't expect any bug fixes or updates.			",307,74,9,35,27,4,38

												Large, enjoyable, underrated action-rpg. Fun, button-mashy combat that still requires some attention/strategy (esp. on hard); pretty good amount of loot; interesting skill trees and character advancement options; semi-sorta-open-world (new chunks of world unlock as you progress deeper into the game). Gameplay is smooth, responsive, and satisfying, though I recommend using a gamepad for this one. Graphics aren't cutting edge, but they're decent. The world, on the whole, is nicely varied and fun to just roam about and button-mash in. On the downside, the world is pretty superficial compared to something like a Bethesda game. There's plenty of lore and subquests and dialogue trees and all of that, but none of it is very involving -- just kind of par for the course, more of a console-game feel to the progression and atmosphere. I can't really fault the game much beyond that, though. It's a really solid game, just don't expect quite the level of depth you'd get from a hardcore open-world PC rpg. At the time I'm writing this it's on sale for under $10, and it's a great get for that price.			",52,6,0,29,6,0,8

GREAT GAME! It's a sad thing that the company that made this masterpiece was put into bankruptcy because of poor planning. They should have gotten more hype on it because it's such a well-done game despite what you might hear from some people.The combat is 8/10.Why? The camera angles, dear god, but the combat itself is amazing. The movements are smooth, not jerky, and can get really fast paced if you play right.The lore is 10/10.Why? It's so developed, that there's no obvious problems with it. You would have to do some serious research to find contradictions and plot-holes.The UI is 9.9/10.Why? Because you can't zoom the minimap in or out, I'd really love to see that change, but it will never come.Should you buy this game? HELL YEAH!There's about 300 HOURS... H-O-U-R-S... of gameplay and story. You will never get bored as easy as you would get bored with other games in the same genre.If you want to know something cool, this game WAS going to be an MMO, but it shut down before that. If ANY professional video game development teams every find themselves lacking a project, TAKE THIS UP!You can buy the IP from Rhode Island and get to work immediately and possibly create a well-deserved sequel.Don't let me down, this game shouldn't have been left to rot.

												Yes, I currently don't have many hours logged on this yet, but on the Xbone I do. Anyways, this game is really under-rated. I say it would give you a good 50+ hours of enjoyable gameplay. I like the combat system and I like the story and quest. I love games that likes to let you explore and this game captures that perfectly. I constantly find myself wandering through caves, forests, and cities. The only con I have with this game is the lack of difficulty. When you hit levle 25-30 every boss become really easy to kill. So by then you should just crank up your difficulty level and keep moving. Of course there are tiny little flaws, but I can't even remember them so they are nothing to worry about. KOA: Reckoning is a playful, exciting, fresh RPG which deserves much more attention.9.5/10 Sloanster Stars			",172,29,5,23,14,0,21

												It's big. Too big even. After about 40 hours of questing I got tired of doing practically the same quests over and over again. I even skipped through the conversations, and I normally read/listen all dialogues, mind you. KoA is basically a MMO game in single-player form. Is it a bad game ? Not by any means. It's just that it loses focus about halfway through, giving you too many quests to deal with. This game can easily take 100+ hours to complete.The active combat system works great; you're not just pushing buttons and waiting for your character to finish off an enemy. YOU do the actual combat. It's fresh until you have unlocked most of your skills though, then it can grow a bit stale.My biggest gripe with the game was the inventory system, which was awkward to use. Having to pause, select a category and (un)equip items that way is cumbersome and frustrating. It's an area that could definitely use some work.For an action RPG it's pretty cool, but don't expect another Skyrim.[Rating: 84/100]			",1661,635,69,222,194,16,225

												If you've heard of this game you may have heard that it is like an MMO.Don't walk away just yet. I'm not an MMO player, but I do enjoy this game.It is like an MMO in some respects, but it lacks the things that make MMOs not fun. For one thing, it isn't grindy. You don't have to invest many hours to get into this game. There are a lot of side quests, but they don't feel as trivial as the ones you might encounter in MMOs. The battle system feels very fluid and polished and you don't have to spam your number keys to get attacks off. As far as what I kind of don't like about this game there is a rather large land to explore, but it consists of a lot of trails and forks in those trails. There are some open areas, but you will mostly find yourself on trails. It isn't a real big negative though because you don't feel like the game is a linear excursion.All in all, this game is worth a look, but especially so if you can get it on a sale.

												Very enjoyable action RPG.The great freedom as to what your character will be (You can just mix all the classes in game, respec and start over anytime), what weapons or spells will you use, what stats will you hone - combined with the oddly satisfying combat (Never was a huge hammer so much fun in a game) and the ""bullet time"" mechanics makes it all very appealing and rarely boring, since you can just whip up completely new character with different fighting style on the spot.The huge world and story is nice. Nothing that will shock you, but you can feel the certain quality that comes with a good writer.On the downside, this game has a terrible FOV, depending on your monitor, you may end up just having your characters back over half of the screen - luckily there is an easy and fast fix called Widescreen Fixer (little program that allows you to set up your FOV and distance of the camera from your character). Another possible downer might be the very MMO-ish style of the quests and progression. You may like or dislike that, comes to personal preferences.Neutral - The game is very long. I mean it. Very long. You will likely never finish it, unless you like it as it can very easily take 100-200 hours. For me that is a plus, but I do understand some people don't fancy games of that length. You've been warned.All in all, I do absolutely recommend this game and think it's a great shame the studio is no more as they could've made something even cooler in the future.

												Recommend -- with caveats. There is a lot to like about this game if your interests lean towards story-heavy rpgs. The world building is generally interesting (and in parts very good), the dialogue pretty solid (and sometimes very good), the main plot line and dlcs are engaging. If you enjoy supplying an internal monologue about your character's motivations and history (e.g. playing the dlc after completing the main quest) this game allows you the space to do that. It's also pleasant to look at, though its paper doll options could be better. Downsides (especially for those interested in story-heavy rpgs): overall, the game has weak ties to other characters. There are no romances or friendships that you can build up outside of quest lines – mostly this left me feeling less-than-fulfilled from a story telling point of view, occasionally left me feeling eye-rollingly awash in cynicism, and sometimes surprised me by how much I came to care for an NPC nonetheless. The voice acting is very much a mixed bag, as are the lorestones (in game archeological audio books). Sometimes they're interesting, rarely affecting, and occasionally, I regretted touching them, because I felt bad for the people involved. The pronunciation in the game is often downright terrible. With the names, I could almost convince myself that the pronunciation changes were deliberate – e.g. the name “Ciara” pronounced as see-ah-ra rather than key-ra, but then, at other points it was just ordinary words that got mangled. Not a big deal for a lot of players of course – but for me, it was more than enough to throw me out of the story and the story was what I came for. Another issue – much of the game is heavily derivative. This is not something I have a big problem with generally, but it's worth mentioning here because of two things: one – it *felt* derivative; it wasn't something I noticed later, but rather as I was playing it, it felt like a retread of other games; two – I found myself thinking in places, “wow that's really interesting, I've never seen that before” and then immediately wondering if it's just because I'd missed the game where someone else had done it first. Again, not an issue for everybody. Someone else can probably talk about visual issues/bugs better than I can, but I would mention two things: post-processing didn't work for me (and if I hadn't worked out the problem in the demo version I probably would not have played the game at all), and some weird design decision during a major main-plot boss fight required me to look up a walkthrough because although I wasn't losing, I couldn't win. My victory was pointless and tedious and in the end I was just glad to get it over with. If I hadn't had dlc left to play, it might well have soured the memory of the game for me. BUT: overall, yes, I would recommend, and I would recommend going in with your eyes open so that you can enjoy all the things the game does well while accepting that parts of it are not fulfilling and some of it is actively frustrating. One final note: it has low to non-existent replay value for me (and I'm generally all about the replays), but I did get about 100 hours out of it between the main quest, faction quests and dlcs.

Seems like the immersion could have been increased alot if the developers did just a few minor tweaks. For instance, switching weapons. In Koa:R, a new weapon will magically appear in your hand. How long would it have taken to animate that?Enjoying this a TON more than Skyrim. Imagine Skyrim with a better story, less walking, and better combat... That is Koa:R.Overall a very good game, but a lot of minor mistakes ruin emmersion. ",615,190,20,65,43,5,93

												Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning delivers exactly what it promises: an awesome fantasy RPG, with visceral, intuitive gameplay that is easy to pick up, wildly flexible and just plain fun, in a way that had previously not been seen in the genre. many people compare it to action games, but it's really more like an updated 3D variation of a Seiken Densetsu / Secret of Mana game. it's an action RPG with exploration, but no real platforming elements, such as no jumping. Lots of neat weapons skills, talents, spells, and combat styles to try out, and a big loot system on top of it that the Mana series only wished it had.{A General note. I pre-ordered this game when it first came out and thus played it on Origin, where I still have a copy owned.  I have three full playthroughs there each with over 130+ hours played, and one has mastercrafted equipment that made me literally invincible [unless I was afflicted with Bleed status]. And a forth playthrough done ""fast"" with over seventy hours on it. So my time played stats here on steam should be added to those for Origin playtime of an additional 450+ hours.}The world is accessible and vast, offering genre fans plenty to sink their teeth into. One gets the sense that they are watching an entire world unfold before them, one rich with history and lore and life. Amalur opens itself up to the player in a way that is both familiar and refreshing, then empowers the player to do incredible things. It is important to note that much of the setting lore is in books and scrolls found along the way in the various nooks and crannies of the game world, and discerned from NPC conversations, rather than thrown at you in raw exposition, except for a few areas early on, during, and near the end of the main plot line.Amalur looks, plays, and feels like a Secret of Mana / Seiken Densetsu game loaded with combos, super powers, and general badass attitude. Usability and player satisfaction were clearly at the heart of the vision for this game, and it shows. Even without a proper targeting system, your avatar quickly shifts between multiple enemies, flinging all sorts of death dealing nastiness around the battlefield. You never feel weak or hindered in combat. Enemies fall to your reaping as you deal a hurricane of destruction, be you an acrobatic Dervish, stoic solid Warrior, or serene Mage.The flexibility of the battle system is truly remarkable. You have access to three talent trees based on your standard warrior, rogue, and mage archetypes, and you assign talent points provided you meet the requirement for each allocation. This allows you to make a straight mage, a fast archer or stealthy stabber, a rough brawler, or any combination in between. The developers even encourage these types of cross-class creations, as statistical bonuses for your potential Hybrid Death-Dealer have already been planned out. Trust me, you can play Amalur any way you want. Better still, re-specing your hero requires only a small investment that is a chunk of resources early on in the game, but gets easier to bear (despite it's escalating cost) as you level up and gather more cash.Then there's the loot. Sweet Lord, is there a lot of loot! Reckoning plays quite similar to Diablo in many ways. You can scour the countryside and find a staff that easily outclasses your current weapon of choice. Maybe you find a turban that gives a massive boost to your mana pool, or perhaps a shield with a substantial bonus to your health regeneration. The character progression and loot acquisition is enough to keep you playing, and that's something I can't really say about a lot of games out there today. In essence, Amalur serves the purpose of providing you with ways to make your virtual death machine as powerful as possible.Mechanically, Reckoning stands above most current RPG releases in interface and reliability. The menus may appear dull to some eyes, but they are easily read and quickly accessed. A junk button for loot allows you to quickly sift through armaments without any hassle, and this needs to be standard in every game, period!The PC version isn't exactly optimized for the mouse and keyboard format however. I suggest using a controller if you have one because Reckoning was clearly designed for the consoles. Still, the game looks remarkably better even on a modest machine. Seeing the world run at 60 FPS certainly helps with the slightly cartoony graphics. 38 Studios and Big Huge Games have created a world worth saving, and they have given us some pretty damn cool tools with which to get the job done.[Updating my review, edited for clarity.]			",156,29,0,45,2,3,7

												Pretty good, but lacks its own identity (feels like Everquest + Fable, and a dozen other rpgs at once), and suffers from a lot of what makes modern RPGs (even many FPS) suck; being artificially extended with pointless busywork. 90% Sidequests for Deliver this to-, Kill 8 of-,.. ""Hey you're supposed to be a warrior on an important mission to save the world, but can you go fetch my <mundane object>?""It's certainly not this game's fault. They ALL do that these days because it's an incredibly easy way to flesh out a game. Leveling via uninpired fetch quests isn't so bad in an MMORPG, but its dull as hell in single player games. I'm not anti-sidequest by any means, its just that they're a whole lot more common and less creative than they used to be.I'd still recommend it for the $5 I paid, though its ~82 metascore feels a bit high. I'd have it closer to 70.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My first impressions of Kingdoms of Amalur, if you're into RPG's get this now, don't wait until it's   on sale.  I played the demo when it was available and on the basis of that pre-purchased the  full version.  I am not disappointed.  It's not Skyrim, but it's got it's own charm, and  in some ways I'm enjoying playing this  as much as Skyrim. Some of the characters look cartoon like, but   the environments are beautifully rendered; not  in a realistic way, but with saturated colors which give the  game another worldly look .  The fighting in my opinion looks better than in Skyrim, with sword fights   similar to Prince of Persia or The Witcher.  The game is played in third person  but that doesn't detract from the game in any way, however I would have liked to have had a choice as sometimes first person is cool and at other times third person.  Overall I would say anyone into dungeon type  RPG's  will love this gorgeous looking game.  There's already DLC available for this game.			",4947,1934,224,565,877,79,758

												Try this game if you really like action RPGs, but if you're looking for a good, solid sandbox adventure, keep on walking.The game world is huge, and I mean HUGE, but a ton of it is padding, and with the limited mobility options you're given, it gets really really tedious carting your sorry carcass all over creation to get things done. After a certain point it becomes a series of well-choreographed and engaging battles held together by drudgery and vast amounts of running, and that's even with fast travel as a possibility.This game was originally envisioned as an MMO, and it really shows. You can't jump on your own, you can't really wander off the beaten path (largely because every path is so thoroughly beaten already) and without a horse or some form of mount you're left to running or sprinting. Calling this game a ""wide-open adventure"" is kind of like calling a hike through redwoods with the inability to look up a ""wide-open adventure;"" all of the things are there, but you can't really utilize them to their fullest capacity.At the end of the day, KOA:R feels exactly like what it is: a U-turn into marketability.

												A decent game, but everything gets repetitive and bland after a while. All the quest mostly meet npc, long run to dungeon, kill kill kill, long run back, get crappy reward. Even with the fast travel its still a lot of running to be done.World map view is separated to two different view, one overall view and one more detail view. You have to go to the overall view to fast travel, which is really annoying since you need to swap between those two and the overall view is pretty much useless.This game would be a great for multiplay/online coop game with their huge world, running alone in the bloody huge world is really tiring.In summary, loads of content, but most of it are the same. Rather then making the world huge they should've concretrate on the quality of the content.			",430,149,13,130,74,3,109

												Let me start this review by saying that I had always seen this game in stores, and passed over it due to just simply not knowing much about the game or the developers. I never looked at gameplay, or even images of the game. I simply gave it no second thoughts. I figured it was another dime-a-dozen adventure game that would be thrown into the void of time and forgotten. Then, I saw the game on sale, and I made the best choice I've made in a long time. I purchased this gem and all the DLC for $9.99KOA: Reckoning is EXACTLY what I always wished Fable would have been. It's a HUGE open world adventure game with awesome loot, tons of quests, simple yet diverse combat (camera being the exception), and very smooth framerate even on the highest settings (The computer I downloaded this on only has an Nvidia GTX 750 :/ ). Anyway, I would highly recommend this game to ANYONE who used to play Fable, and wished for more. Kingdoms delivers on all fronts, and I can't believe I didn't buy this earlier. It's an absolute STEAL for the price.I won't go into an expansive list of pros and cons because you can find countless reviews prior to this one listing all of them. I'll just say that no game is perfect, but it's the amount of fun you have with it which really speaks to a game's quality. I can easily see myself investing 100+hours into this game without even blinking an eye, specially since there's the might/stealth/magic skill trees you can specialize in, making playing through a second or third time a very real possibility.

												Just like the description of the game, it's litterally Salvatore, McFarlane and Rolston meshed into one. This game is freaking rad. I don't play many RPGs like I used to, but this one is a good exception. The game play is like a mix of elderscrolls, mass effect and the witcher. The world is absolutly massive and its quest overload (just like an elderscrolls game). The world (that I've seen thus far) is oversized giant mushroom styled high fantasy....its pretty to say the least. Dialoge, actually pretty well done. A lot of folks seem to think this plays like crap on PC, well I disagree. This plays very fluid. Don't like the keys? Rebind them. I already see myself tossing a couple hundred hours into this. Totally worth the whole 12 bucks or so for the game + DLC on sale. I'd be willing to throw 20 at it....well worth it.			",511,106,11,72,14,3,65

												This game made me feel like a kid again.I've played a ton of games to the point where I felt like nothing was new, but this is defintely a unique game.It's graphics look pretty good for it's time. It's got more of a fantasy look than anything and they certainly did a good job on that. While in combat everything looks really smooth and it's fun to look at... especially those finishers, oh man. Sometimes the combat is a little clunky though, mostly regarding the camera. It doesn't have a lock on feature so sometimes it's a little frustrating when you're trying to lock target onto someone else. With that aside, the combat is still great.Usually with an RPG, you'll have to go down a specific specialization to be powerful. That mostly holds true in this game, though you can still spread your talents more thin and still not do underwhelming damage. There's lots and lots and lots of quests. You might not even find all of them which makes this game great. Though it's no Elder Scrolls size, it's still a large game. Because you can make so many different characters and take different quest paths, it's definitely got great replay value. I'd certainly reccomend this game.9/10			",104,9,0,15,8,0,3

												Great loot and combat system. Everything else is generic. Not saying that it's bad. On the contrary, for a new-comer, it is a fantastic start. To be frank, Reckoning is a great game for the veterans of the genre as well thanks to its engaging combat and not too shallow class system. I am only sounding less enthused while writing this review is because this is my second go with the game --the first being on the xbox 360 back when the game came out. ",16,10,0,6,3,0,2

												Very fun game. It's basically a tad bit more linear than Skyrim but also far more colerful, fantasy looking and the abilities/combat have more oomph or excitement to them. You can combo attacks and such. There is a problem with some auto targetting as aspect, but that is partly coming from somebody used to and with a preference to TES:Skyrim attack aiming. The combat is super fun, an intriguing story, cool enemies with absolutely well done themes and music. I was VERY SAD when the company tanked from bad management of funds when making the MMO version of this game: It was my most anticipated MMO in my life, based on the gameplay of this game in single player- I hope that says a lot, at least as to what I wanted to see in the MMO world when it comes to gameplay and design mechanics. So much to do, interesting weapons and cool abilities/skill trees. CON:It has some bugs and at times the UI comes as rough or not intuitive, that is a bit limited. Literally it has a number of design similarities to Skyrim, as some people that worked on it worked on this game and you can tell. IT has the UI flaws without offering the huge mod culture Skyrim did. That is the main CON to this game.My hard drive crashed when I was many hours into it so I stopped playing for a long while waiting for a good time to jump back in			",55,1,0,5,1,0,2

												Pros: - Beautiful, vibrant, and huge open world.- Good graphics and music.- Decent story.- Good replay value.- Huge content. Lots of sidequests, some are interesting.- Combat is fun but may be repetitive for some people.Cons:- Lack of monster variety. For such a large fantasy world there really isn't much monster variety, mostof them are just different colors with no new attacks.- Some bugs (unfortunately will never be fix).- Speech skill is generally useless.- Not really ""hard"": Hard mode is challenging in the first 3-5 hours.- So-so main characters in the story.- Not much dialogue choices, just choosing between A and B.- (nitpicking) The Fae are boring people.- (nitpicking) Piles of rubbles and dead bodies has more useful loot than chests.

												A pretty formulaic action RPG with a sometimes-interesting story and little to no challenge involved on even Hard difficulty. If you've played Fable, that's roughly what you should be expecting. It's okay for wasting a couple of days of your life and somewhat enjoying it, but the wasted potential makes me cri evertim.

The gameplay is loads of fun and offers a ton of variety in terms of what your character can do to fight. Finally, load times seem to be very low, and overall it's an amazing RPG to play!

												Let me start this review by saying that I had always seen this game in stores, and passed over it due to just simply not knowing much about the game or the developers. I never looked at gameplay, or even images of the game. I simply gave it no second thoughts. I figured it was another dime-a-dozen adventure game that would be thrown into the void of time and forgotten. Then, I saw the game on sale, and I made the best choice I've made in a long time. I purchased this gem and all the DLC for $9.99KOA: Reckoning is EXACTLY what I always wished Fable would have been. It's a HUGE open world adventure game with awesome loot, tons of quests, simple yet diverse combat (camera being the exception), and very smooth framerate even on the highest settings (The computer I downloaded this on only has an Nvidia GTX 750 :/ ). Anyway, I would highly recommend this game to ANYONE who used to play Fable, and wished for more. Kingdoms delivers on all fronts, and I can't believe I didn't buy this earlier. It's an absolute STEAL for the price.I won't go into an expansive list of pros and cons because you can find countless reviews prior to this one listing all of them. I'll just say that no game is perfect, but it's the amount of fun you have with it which really speaks to a game's quality. I can easily see myself investing 100+hours into this game without even blinking an eye, specially since there's the might/stealth/magic skill trees you can specialize in, making playing through a second or third time a very real possibility.

												Wow... what an unsung gem of a game, I would guess its very approachable from a variety of skill levels. The world is big, with lots to do and see. the Environments are fantastic and varied. The character models look good, I've heard some reviewers claim they could have been better but I personally feel the art and style of everything in Amalur meshes well. The action oriented combat is great. There is also a huge story and lots of well acted voice dialog.If I showed this to my Fiance she would probably keep the controller for herself. I guess I'll eventually have to show her because she loves art and creative media. Kingsoms of Amalur really is that pretty, once she starts getting the hang of the controls (which are easy to use, while also having depth) we'll have one more thing we like to share.

												Just like the description of the game, it's litterally Salvatore, McFarlane and Rolston meshed into one. This game is freaking rad. I don't play many RPGs like I used to, but this one is a good exception. The game play is like a mix of elderscrolls, mass effect and the witcher. The world is absolutly massive and its quest overload (just like an elderscrolls game). The world (that I've seen thus far) is oversized giant mushroom styled high fantasy....its pretty to say the least. Dialoge, actually pretty well done. A lot of folks seem to think this plays like crap on PC, well I disagree. This plays very fluid. Don't like the keys? Rebind them. I already see myself tossing a couple hundred hours into this. Totally worth the whole 12 bucks or so for the game + DLC on sale. I'd be willing to throw 20 at it....well worth it.			",511,106,11,72,14,3,65

												If you like RPG's then this one is worth a look. When it comes on special, grab it and all the DLC's.The good:Nice graphics.Large open world.Entertaining story lines across most quests.I enjoyed the combat system pairing both physical and magic attacks.The bad:As the dev house ran out of money / time, some of the quests and cut scenes are buggy but this does not detract from the overall experience. The entertainment value outwieghed the few minor bugs.I did encounter one major bug that resulted in an incomplete quest. The quest dialog says that you should pick pocket one of the NPC's, which I did. However, the quest did not progress. I then discovered, in the quests menu, that you should kill the NPC and then recover the items.All in all, a good game and worth it when it comes on special.			",42,8,2,5,1,0,5

												I have so much to say about Kingdoms! This is one of my all time favorite RPG games. The battles can be a bit repetative and you can count on your enemy throwing the same fight combo at you time and time again (which makes it pretty easy to get those parry achievements) The story line is huge! and there is so much to do in this game which brings me to my first complaint... the level cap :( You can reach the level cap by just doing the main factions. The first time i beat the main story line i was a little bummed to learn of the level cap. I mean who doesnt like to watch their XP sky rocket when you finally beat that main pain in the a** boss?! However, i just started a new game, leveled up the weapons i knew i loved and kept on going. Sometimes the camera view got a bit wonky, its hard to fight when the camera decides to view only the ground lol but it is possible. Just a slight annoyance. The open world is also huge! There are tons of side quests to keep you busy for quite awhile. I love the Fast Travel option, which lets be honest, who doesnt just love spending half the game walking from end of the map to other?! (insert sarcastic gaze) Fast Travel really really helps with a map that is this big. I downloaded The Teeth of Narcos DLC after i beat the game the first time. It's okay.... The underground sewer is a bit of a maze and isnt as ""open"" as the main game map, but it's still pretty fun. Again, it brings up the level cap that sucks....The game says Partial Controller Support but after 200 somthing hours i would have to say that its pretty much full controller. Has anyone heard of a Kingdoms 2?			",19,5,0,7,0,0,1

This is by far one of the most entertaining RPGs I've played, with loads of content, fun and deep crafting system, engaging combat, etc. etc. BHG did a really good job.Pros:-Incredibly bug-free-Fun, smooth, combat-Flexible character development with easy respec-Great storytelling all over-Truely unique world-Great crafting system-I could go on and onCons:The only complaints I have are:-No new-game plus, so replay value is limited-The complex zone level-locking mechanic, in order to get the best loot and have the most end-game loot options, you'll want to level as much as possible in each zone before moving on to the next, and plan out the order you visit zones carefully, but that will make you overpowered for some areas; if you don't care about end-game loot you can just play through as you like.

 Intro To begin off with, yes this is a very alluring title of a game. With a good backstory and gameplay to easily dive into this is really the icing on the cake of RPG games. Sitting next to Oblivion, the Gothic Series and Two worlds this game is very simular in the sense of being unheard of and tending to push people away cause it's a bit older than some other titles.Story time; I played this game back in september 2012, after its Febuary release, when it was free for playstation plus, I easily clocked over 100 hours in my first playthrough. (It's so easy to get lost in the behemoth world map or get trapped into a string of quests which could be both a bessing or a curse) The pros heavily outweigh the cons, to prove so I'll make a nifty list to point out highlights in gameplay. Pros Fast paced combat+Rewarding quests+Compelling story line+Dark Souls boss setups+Enemy variety+Weapon variety+Character builds+Weapon combos+Quality DLC (worth it imo)+Minimal grinding+Interesting lore+Aged like fine wine+Loot system+Lighting and textures+WAIFU DARK ELF Cons -Very casual, easy-Mid-game difficulty spike-Hit and run combat (large enemies mostly)-Few boss fights-CTRL C + CTRL V dungeons-Enemies equivalent to Fallout 4 bullet sponges-(Story spoiler) The end Conclusion All together this is quite the tempting offhand game for people who enjoy any major titles running along the lines of Skyrim or....Witcher... Anyways, as I was saying, to completely clarify the whole fighting thing yes the boss fights are amazing, the encounters are clever and converge well with the gameplay without leaving any gross stitch lines, speaking in retrospect that is, the large enemies like the giant tri-boob desert serpent thing (Banshaen if I recall correctly) and other colossal like relitives are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to fight since you can't stunlock them into submission and don't even get me going about those Son of Laz gangbangs and Scav gank squads it's like Threshold Bridge & Iron Keep SotFS all over again. There's so much more I can say about this game but I'm just going to end saying; all in all it's a good game to pick up and play in your freetime as you don't have to dedicate and learn it unlike a few other RPGs and JRPGs. 8/10tl;dr:Quality game to jump right into, suggest buying on sale			",56,8,0,10,4,0,1

												Very expansive world with a lot of atmospheric variety.  Very beautiful.  Dungeons got a little cut and paste, which was disappointing, but they're dungeons and caves.  Controls are pretty intuitive on KB&M, depending on your playstyle.  You can also respec at any point for a fee if you realize you messed up your build.  There are some bugs that affect your inventory (stuff that won't leave your inventory and just take up space), but the game as a whole is very polished.  Crafting is the best way to get good gear, so invest some points in blacksmithing.  Expect to do a lot of running everywhere.  This was an MMO that switched gears mid-development, so you won't get mounts to make travel faster to undiscovered locations. There is fast travel to to discovered locations, which helps.The DLCs were enjoyable and worth the extra money.  You can also continue to explore after you go through the main quest line to mop up anything you missed.  7.5/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm going to compare this game to Witcher 2 and Skyrim because they are my two favourite RPGs and many people have played them. Secondly, if you're going to buy this game, it goes on sale fairly often so I would suggest waiting for a saleKoA does a lot of things right but a lot is sincerely average:KoA has the option to completely change your character's style and perks at any point meaning that you can change the type of character you have whenever you want to try something new. This is cool but it made me feel like a second playthrough would be fairly pointless as I have already tried all the character builds in one playthrough.Playing through the whole game the environments are beautiful and varied. The look of the game is more animated than Skyrim or the Witcher and this gives it a ""friendlier"" look, this is either good or bad depending on your preference.The fighting mechanic is fun and fairly reactive, being more like the Witcher than Skyrim. You can dodge and mix spells and abilities seamlessly in with melee or ranged combat. I found the game too easy, playing the whole thing on hard and never really struggling, eventually you become so powerful that you cannot be beaten and fighting creatures becomes tedious even though the fighting mechanic is funThe main story line is decent and has some originality but is definitely not on the level of the Witcher (but few games are in my opinion)The faction storylines are fun and to the point but fairly predictableBut the side quests have some cool little twists and original little stories.The soundtrack is terribly repetitive and NPCs like talking during battles which results in you missing half of what they are saying because the background noise is so loudSome reviewers found the voice acting sketchy but I did not notice any problemsThere is a lot of lore to be discovered which is nice for people into that and it isn't thrown in your face so you can ignore it if you wantLastly, you can sell any item to any merchant and they all have unlimited funds (because running around trying to sell things in Skyrim is pretty annoying)Pros:Beautiful environmentsGreat fighting mechanicLots of loreDecent storylineRecustomising your character at any pointCons:Too easy (for a Dark Souls person)Predictable Repetitive soundtrack and some difficulty hearing NPCs explain key story points (which they don't repeat)No point in a second playthroughSo in conclusionKoA is a fun game that I would recommend to any RPG fan, but I personally would not rank it above either Skyrim or the Witcher 2			",45,6,1,4,2,0,4

												KoA:R was a surprise buy for me while I was trying to take a break from binging on Dota 2. Didn't touch it for a few weeks before deciding I would dust it off.I honestly should have started playing this sooner.One design aspect I really enjoyed when starting off is how easily I was able to distract myself early in the game regarding combat and character development. Normally in these types of open RPGs, I tend to get bored early on and rarely get to the part of the game where you actually feel badass and know what you're doing: you have good gear, nice weapons you're glad to have found, some money in the bank, etc. KoA:R lets you play around enough early on with different playstyles so that by the time you find the playstyle that fits you best, you are already well-geared and feel like a power house.Combat is fluid, the weapons are overall pretty great (although I wish I had more patience for the slower weapons in the game e.g. Greatsword, Hammer, etc.).There are likely flaws to this game that I haven't mentioned, but currently, I haven't really found anything that would annoy me enough to stop playing mid-session.PRO-TIP: Play on hard mode!! I started off on Hard and was wondering why some of the enemies were still so easy. This changes as your progress and find new mobs to fight, and luckily this is around the time where you are able to grasp how to hold your own.9/10 Still playing, and will likely reroll a character after I finish on this guy!

												I'm hesitant to recommend this game because I didn't love it, but for some reason I kept playing it until the end.  I found myself speeding through some of the more boring bits of the game just to see the main storyline through to completion, but honestly, the main story leaves much to be desired.  The world is huge and feels very complete, but unfortunately much of this is lost if you--like me--can't quite cross the threshold into obsession with exploring the world.The gameplay is fairly fun and varied for an action RPG, but the skill progression for the sorcery tree is VERY unbalanced.  You'll spend the first third of the game abusing the same couple of abilities over and over again, feeling somewhat underpowered and dependent on your physical weapon to fill in the damage gaps.  It starts to balance out a bit in the middle of the sorcery tree, but then the scales are tipped ridiculously upon reaching the highest tier.  The Meteor ability is capable of wiping out an entire group of enemies, and while it does have a long cooldown, it is always ready by the time you reach the next group and doesn't consume enough mana to slow you down.  Speaking of mana, itemization was a bit frustrating and seemed too random.  I finished the game with a staff bought from a vendor, but then again, I was just destroying armies of fools with giant meteors summoned from the depths of space, so who needs a nice staff?One of the things that continued to irritate me in this game is the sound.  I'm not sure if they didn't have the budget for a good sound team or if they hired amateurs, but the sounds in this game feel completely wrong.  One example is the sound they used for a shattering clay jar.  It doesn't feel like part of the environment, but instead a flat sound file played slightly out of sync with the action.  There are many other examples of terrible sounds throughout the game.  The music was occasionally decent, but for the most part it was forgettable.The graphics in this game were nice enough, and the art style felt consistent and well-done.  Framerate was never an issue on my aging machine--even with settings on max--so clearly the core tech team behind the engine knew what they were doing.All of my complaints aside, I still found myself coming back to this game day after day to see what was around the next bend.  Upon completion, I almost felt as if I could do more exploring or wrap up some of those faction quests I left unfinished...but, I have better games to play.  If you like MMO-style gameplay and want to get lost in a big, lonely world for hours on end, give Kingdoms of Amalur a shot.  However, if you--like me--find yourself with less and less time to play games these days, you may not get as much out of this game as you put into it.			",144,26,0,23,8,0,20

												This game is:An rpgThat plays like Dragon Age: OriginsThat also plays like an MMOWith the combat style of Dragon Age: 2.I'll explain. If you've ever played an MMO before, you'll know that there's a rotation to your skills/abilities. This game offers up three sorts of abilities - melee, ranged, and magic. The game allows you cross-abilities and encourages it. The UI is set up like a typical MMO sort. The controls aren't difficult to grasp.You move as though you were in an action game. Think Kingdom Hearts if you've ever played that. Or Devil May Cry.This game came out about the same time as Skyrim. It was overlooked because of this, and subsequently the developers went out of business.This is a tragedy. The game has the same open world feel as Skyrim, and allows you to fast travel to places you've been before. The looting system is much the same, only it allows for more.For instance, you get the inventory is full instead of slowing down.For another, within your inventory are bags. Each bag is for a crafting. Alchemy, sagecrafting (jewelcrafting), and blacksmithing. The components for all are placed within these bags, and not in your actual inventory. So you can stock up as much as you like on them all.You're able to purchase a house, expand it, and have your own shared storage within it.The scenery is gorgeous, the characters are pretty amusing, and while the character customization is sparse, you're allowed to be something other than friggin' human.The plot has an absolutely fascinating premise, and how many games can you play that starts you off in a dumping ground for corpses?It also touches a LOT on fae mythology. Brownies, trolls, sprites, etc. The elves are particularly badass in this game rather than being a bunch of pretentious snots or a downtrodden race.The downside to this game is that there won't be any sequels coming to it due to the company going out of business.

												So take World of Warcraft and Fable-esque art style and questing but add dynamic combat mechanics akin to Darksiders or Devil May Cry and you get Kingdoms of Amalur. While the story is somewhat lackluster and dull, the open ended exploration of vivid Amalur and it's treasures/loot make up for it shortcomings. The character builds consist of classic dungeon crawling roles of the Warrior, the Mage and the Rogue or combinations of the three classes which offer unique combat approaches. Unlike other open world RPGs ,like Skyrim, you are able to completely respec a character's perk points (for a fee) if you feel you made a bad decision in their allocation or just want a change of pace. Almost 25 hours into this game and I feel I've only scratched the surface. Great buy!			",94,6,0,11,5,0,10

												This game surprised me.  I read some reveiws that said it was surprisingly good but it still caught me off guard.  I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I am.  It's a pleasant feeling to be surprised these days by a game that seemed to be so resoundingly denounced on release.  I highly recommend playing it, even with all its' flaws, because it's fun and familiar. Let's get the bad out of the way:-The first 30 minutes.  It's awkward to control without tweaking because it was absolutely designed to be used with a controller.  If you have one, I recommend using it.  If not, tinker with sensitivity and hotkeys to make it more playable.  The defacto tutorial level is unimpressive, slightly confusing, and rather buggy.  It takes you through each class and weapon type but you don't have to commit just yet.  At this point it seems to be super linear, on rails type of game but push through to the first village and it opens up.-The camera.  It takes getting used to.  The third person perspective is unfortunate.  While I generally play in third person, not having the option to move the camera is frustrating at times.  This is one of the areas where it's design for consoles is very evident.-Vanilla.  This isn't really a negative or a positive.  It's what you expect from a game like this.  Some fetch quests, some kill quests, some steal quests, a few factions and schools to join, and the RPG trinity of classes.  Even with some multiclassing, it's still an expected experience class wise.The Good:-Rich lore.  If you didn't know, it is written by RA Salvatore and it shows.  Some of the stories feel familiar if you are a fan of his books.  One of the first questlines, The House of Ballads, is very interesting and they continue in the vein throughout.-Tons of side quests.

The world is so beautiful looking on top of all of that. I bought this because I have been a fan of Salvator for a while, so I decided to buy it to add to my steam library and never play, like I do most games.This game I actually continued to play and love every minute of it!

												Very fun and addictive combat. Story is good yet suffers from a lot of the typical and overdone gater/kill x quests. The world, however is very deep and rich. The voice acting ranges from laughable to good or great.The inventory system leaves much to be desired but isn't any worse than unmodded Skyrim.Overall, it's very enjoyable and doesn't require you to replay to try out the different classes.

												So take World of Warcraft and Fable-esque art style and questing but add dynamic combat mechanics akin to Darksiders or Devil May Cry and you get Kingdoms of Amalur. While the story is somewhat lackluster and dull, the open ended exploration of vivid Amalur and it's treasures/loot make up for it shortcomings. The character builds consist of classic dungeon crawling roles of the Warrior, the Mage and the Rogue or combinations of the three classes which offer unique combat approaches. Unlike other open world RPGs ,like Skyrim, you are able to completely respec a character's perk points (for a fee) if you feel you made a bad decision in their allocation or just want a change of pace. Almost 25 hours into this game and I feel I've only scratched the surface. Great buy!			",94,6,0,11,5,0,10

												I've always felt RPGs to be a bit different than other types of games. They require time, dedication, and skill. But in return, they give you one of the greatest possible benifits- no, not a drip for your sensory systems or endorphins, but an endless creativity and a bueatiful world. That being said, creating a game is different from creating a painting. It can't just look good, it must be fun to play, fun to interact with, fun to experience. And while when many think of RPG, TES comes to mind, I think Amalur: Reckoning is one of those games that is sorely missed. It carries you into a colerfull, viberant, world, ripe with imagination and ready for the taking. It gives you what is, in my opinion, a better system than any other game- it allows you to have the freedom of skyrim, but also the classical class system and skill trees. The gameplay is fun, the world is simply gourgeous, and the lore is plentiful. This is one hell of a game you would not want to miss.(NOTE: I am a PC gamer, however, I find this game is much more enjoyable with Xbox 360 controller. Its not meant for it, but it sure should be!)			",92,26,0,9,9,3,27

The story is what really does it for this title, not only the main story line but the faction story arcs as well, and even the one offs. I recommend this title for any RPG fan.

Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a triumph that makes the prospect of a future MMO based on the same world and engine all the more enticing. 8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game surprised me.  I read some reveiws that said it was surprisingly good but it still caught me off guard.  I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I am.  It's a pleasant feeling to be surprised these days by a game that seemed to be so resoundingly denounced on release.  I highly recommend playing it, even with all its' flaws, because it's fun and familiar. Let's get the bad out of the way:-The first 30 minutes.  It's awkward to control without tweaking because it was absolutely designed to be used with a controller.  If you have one, I recommend using it.  If not, tinker with sensitivity and hotkeys to make it more playable.  The defacto tutorial level is unimpressive, slightly confusing, and rather buggy.  It takes you through each class and weapon type but you don't have to commit just yet.  At this point it seems to be super linear, on rails type of game but push through to the first village and it opens up.-The camera.  It takes getting used to.  The third person perspective is unfortunate.  While I generally play in third person, not having the option to move the camera is frustrating at times.  This is one of the areas where it's design for consoles is very evident.-Vanilla.  This isn't really a negative or a positive.  It's what you expect from a game like this.  Some fetch quests, some kill quests, some steal quests, a few factions and schools to join, and the RPG trinity of classes.  Even with some multiclassing, it's still an expected experience class wise.The Good:-Rich lore.  If you didn't know, it is written by RA Salvatore and it shows.  Some of the stories feel familiar if you are a fan of his books.  One of the first questlines, The House of Ballads, is very interesting and they continue in the vein throughout.-Tons of side quests.  You can get lost in sidequests for a few hours with each new area and those discovered in the wild.-Combat seems simple on the surface (and can remain so if you desire) but with multiclassing can become dynamic and engaging.-Crafting!

Immersion is completely to the 9's, the artwork amazing, and possibly the most convincing voice acting of any RPG I've played of late.  It's only weakness that I have seen is it's combat so far.  Simple and only challenging sometimes.  This may be cured by the difficulty slider, but due to the big warning that is given for changing it, I have left it for this playthrough.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of those games I found by chance, and so I had no expectations going into it (other than ""the screenshots looked pretty""). I ended up really, really enjoying it.Pros:--OMG this game is SO PRETTY.--Enjoyable combat and malleable skills. Good variety of weapons, and the spell animations are fun.--When playing with a controller, the camera handling is pretty good. There have been several fights where the camera angles have added a lot of drama and ""wow factor"". Haven't played with a keyboard and mouse so I can't speak to that, --The world is MASSIVE and there's lots of exploration.Cons:Sometimes the subtitles for the lorestones don't sync with the sound. There's also a part near the end game when the lorestones will talk over a character giving you important backstory.Some of the names of places and people have that weird, hokey fantasy name thing going on. You can tell that there was an attempt to make the naming schemes different for the elves, dwarves, humans, etc, it's all equally hokey-sounding to me.There are some game-breaking bugs, including one in the main quest line.

													I purchased Kingdoms of Amalur on Steam as a complete package for $11.99 which included all of the DLC and finished the main story in 53 hours.  As with most games I play, I finished all the side quests I came across. Graphics – Great	I loved the graphics in KOA.  There is a strong a vivid use of color and the world is filled with detail.  Animations are fluid and my PC never once stuttered the frame rate from a constant 60 fps.  The environments could have used a little more variety as by endgame you will grow tired of the same recycled assets. Music – Fair	The music in KOA is well orchestrated but the songs lack depth and variety.  More songs would have been a plus as a large amount of time is spent in each area before going to the next and this can have you listening to the same loop for many hours at a time. Cinematics – Good	Picture the same dialogue cutscenes as KOTOR or Mass Effect.  The dialogue itself is very well written but unlike the Mass Effect series, you may not find yourself delving into the various conversation options.  The characters and their backgrounds just weren’t interesting enough for me.  The choices during conversations also lacked the Mass Effect style feeling of autonomy.  You could make good or evil choices but it never mattered much.  “Quick Time” events in combat are a cool sight to see. Story – Good	As RPGs go, this story is original and kept me interested enough to finish the game to see what happens.  I did not grow attached to any of the side characters or find them interesting.  This game is really all about you.  The main villain(s) were menacing but far from the kind of evil we love to hate. Control – Great	I had no issues with the controls.  They are very simple and easy to learn.  The UI was easy enough to use.  The awkward camera may startle you at first but you quickly get used to it. Gameplay – Fair	I played as a melee class so your experience may vary.  Combat in the beginning is fun but quickly grows stale.  All I really had to do was click mouse 1 until everything died.  Even on the hard setting, combat becomes too easy as you gain better weapons and armor.  You completely overpower everything and I did not die once the entire game.  I also never needed any of the consumable items with the exception of a very rare healing potion. Content – Good	There is plenty to do here and the game’s zones adjust to your level so you are free to do as little or as much as you want to for side quests.  The loot you find is very rewarding in the beginning of the game but by the middle, I was scrapping everything I found for parts.  I had over five million gold with nothing to spend it on. Value – Great	For $12 I had 53 hours of fun.  The game is huge and kept me playing until I finished.  I did not feel inclined to play through the DLC quest lines.  In my opinion, they weren’t worth it. Recommended – Yes	I recommend this game for the price I paid.  In my opinion, this game is worth $20 or less.  It is currently $19.99 on Steam without the DLC.

												Great Game! except there is no co-op....-1This is a game of wonder, you can explore the world, have a lot of quest and side quest, their mission is fun and take alot of time to complete,each mission has their own plot and genre story, while doing a quest, player can go around kill a monster, animal, people which not related to the quest for a no reason, also you can choose side, where i can regonize them as bad or evil, good or juctice, and ""i don't care"" charcter type. Not only that, you also can reach a state of question: ""what the heck im doing right now?"" because there is no set of ""rule"" that you can follow. So, i give this game... Fun: 2/4 & Plot:4/4The good thing about this game is the avatar can be customize yet its boring, of course its fun, you can create your own character and became the character by exploring the world and experience the tale of your awesomeness, but, that's make you feels there is lack of something. There is no love, yes, i cant find anything that i can love about this avatar. Why? because there is no character to fall in love with! P/s: Also, the customerize appreance,face,and others stuff is limited. Character:1/4Skill set is awesome, you can upgrade your own power based on what type of your character, not only that, the charcter can have a multiple type of skill set and power.This mean, i can play as mage but at the same time,i can play as rogue. Yet, the weopen is limited, there is nothing fancy about them, just a typical weopen that can been seen on others game. Skill&Inventory: 3/4Overall, there is nothing much to talk about, this is a good game, if you are a player that like to play a game like diablo, torchlight, or any common game that share the traits of RPG and pack of full blown action, this is a game for you( while waiting new game to get realease). Overall: 3/5			",54,0,2,1,2,0,0

												An excelent game. It has a level of character customizability that rivals and possibly surpasses the Elder Scrolls series. Your ability to thoroughly customize your character's powers and abilities adds a level of forthought to who you want your character to be while you fight. If you don't like the way your stats are progressing, then you can wipe the slate clean and start over. Through the course of the story line, you could have a warrior, a mage, a rogue, a combination of any two, or all three. Plus, your ability to sneak, forge, craft potions, find hdden items and other such skills are seperate from the combat skill trees. You could have a warrior with an insanely high sneaking and discovering items skills, or a thief that likes to forge weapons and armor. Basically, this game is definately worth playing, Nine out of ten, I'd say.			",85,5,0,21,7,0,1

												Short: The game is amazing, yet so underrated and overlooked. It's got good character customization and creation, it has a plethora of awesome weapons and delivers a funny yet dramatic storyline.* Pros- Open world (HUGE)- Lots of weapons and other equipment- Three ""classes"" to choose from, warrior (Might), rogue (Finesse) and mage (Sorcery) with lots of skills each, which can be mixed! (I.e. Might/Finesse or Finesse/Sorcery or a bit of everything).- The player is fateless, so you can choose different fate-cards that have different effects, choices in dialogue also make differences.- Funny dialogue, you can decide what to say and get a funny response if it's absurd.- Lots to explore, many dungeons, areas and quests!- Awesome combos and finishing moves* Cons- Lacks some sounds, even though your player says something, there's no sound for the dialogue. (Though the npc's are voiced)- There aren't as many monsters as weapons, enough, but there could be more. (Some vanilla are even used in the dlc content)- There's no mounts, so running everywhere is a pain sometimes. (There is fast-travel though)			",89,11,0,15,2,0,9

												Eh, it's okay. There is a massive amount of content in the game, so it is a definitive timesink, which is great for open worlds at the scale of this one. But, I found the lore difficult to understand, story old, tried and true. I can't get into it as much as I would like, and much like Skyrim, after a while, it just becomes Dungeon/Cave Simulator. Go in hole, kill that, come back. At least there's fast travel.It's better suited to be played with a controller, but my biggest gripe is the FOV: holy jesus it's practically stuck to the back of the character's head. If you do pick up the game, either expect motion sickness, or install an FOV fix, such as Widescreen Fixer. It's worth picking up and playing, you might enjoy it more than I did, but it's no masterpiece.			",113,11,2,24,17,2,7

												This game really fullfilled my action RPG needs and it's got some great features. First of all, I got a bit shaken off by the camera system, but I got used to it. It's quite funny because this game kinda has to be compared to Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, because they came out practically at the same time. I made a bit of a comparison with a friend where I called this one a ""little skyrim"".That said, this game has some unique features, such as:+Fate meter/Reckoning Mode (special combat mode, like an overdrive)+Twists of Fate (bonus after certain key quests)+Destinies (passives according to character stat growth you made)The game has some replay value since you can:+Do story and optional quests again giving different answers and check the other's reactions+Invest on Persuasion in order to see different reactions+Align yourself to good or evil in certain story quests where you're given the option to either kill an ancient being(or keep it imprisioned) or unleash him for his powerAs for the game design itself, some pros and cons are:Pros:+You can do Stat resets anytime by visiting a Fateweaver and paying some game currency+Fast paced combat which rewards for diversity over repetition+Varied weapons, skills and playstyles to choose and re-choose from+Big meaningful sidequests for certain factions+Skippable DRM (the game asks for your e-mail, but if you don't input it, it carries on)+Investing on different abilities (lockpicking, blacksmithing, stealth, detect hidden,...) may unlock new dialogue optionsCons:-The main storyline boss fights are quite dull-Most of times your input doesn't matter for how the NPCs' general reaction unless it's from one of those unlockable options-Once you enter a map, monsters are designed to accomodate to the level you were when you entered, forever, meaning old areas become easy pretty fast if you're ""running errands""-Killing enemies while stealth doesn't alarm someone beside that guy, but killing a civilian in a city hidden in the attic brings all the cities' guards over, for some reason.Overall verdict:It has got me playing for some time and got me interested in the story and some of it's features, but it didn't become memorable and some parts of it just seemed unpolished. Your interaction with the game's world is meaningful, but only to a certain extent.			",56,7,1,11,3,0,3

												Highly enjoyable, fun gameplay, good story, quite a bit of customization and  seemingly great deal of replayability. I went full Warrior, you can do Thief and Mage as well or any combo of the 3. I hear people call this a mix of God of War and Oblvion. I can certainly see what they mean, but its not quite right. Youll occasionally have to rapidly click M1, M2, or space, Its not like GoW's massive amount of button presses and analog stick twistings QTE sequence.Tiny gripe; Oftentimes, youll be on a cliff or ledge, youll have to find the predetermined spot that the game allows you to jump off. Its not hard its just a bit silly. Its the only time youll be able to jump in the game. A must buy on sale!			",212,35,5,42,11,2,17

												Been playing this a lot, and it's really great. Such a shame that it's not more known than it is.Pros:Good story with lots of nice sidestories.Lovely grafics considered it being from 2012.Great combat, with totally different attacking styles and abitilies depending on weapons.Really cool skill tree and hero progression. Just awesome abitlities! Crafting weapons and armorForging. being able to insert gems into weapons and armor that you created yourself.Loots lots of loot with a very high amount of different armor and weapons.Big map with lots of quests.Cons.you have to play in hard mode for it to be a challenge, none the less, when you Do play it in Hard, there's basicly little to no cons.---------Someone addressed the item stash being limited. I believe you start at 70 items max. but as you explore, you'll find shops where you can buy ""upgrades"" for your stash, which allows more space. I currently can hold 130.Buying the Dlc's is a must. They are really good, and add some great stuff to the game.10/10			",17,1,0,1,1,0,0

I decided to purchase this game on Steam while it was on sale {Because I am cheap haha.} and it was an amazing purchase. It is as fun as a remember. As for the keyboard controls, I had to rebind most of them to suit my hand placement. The Wakening mode finisher is difficult for me with a laggy computer to pull off, but it is still rewarding to see those animations. I would rate this game a nine of ten.			",46,8,1,16,3,0,3

												Se você pensa em que esse jogo está abaixo das expectativas, com toda certeza você está enganado. Eu fui assim em relação a ele, até joga-lo. E mudei totalmente meu ver, é um daqueles jogos que são pouco divulgados, mas merecem o reconhecimento.O jogo se passa no Reino de Amalur, onde você é um escolhido do '' Destino '', algo que torna as coisas ao redor mudarem, e você é o principal protagonista de um certo experimento ter dado certo e escolhido para impedir o mal ( Clichê que nunca acaba. )Mas, vendo ao mundo vasto que Amalur mostra, sidequests são quase infinitas, dungeons são várias e os cenários,  super bem feitos e diferenciados.Eu já vi isso em vários outros jogos, mas de qualquer forma vale ressaltar o elemento mais ♥♥♥♥ que KoA abrange:  o Combate Hack N' Slash.Não é como em RPGs clássicos que você '' de repente '' encontra um inimigo, ou em uma batalha em turnos, é tudo naquele momento, você viu o inimigo e ja começa a pancadaria, independente do ambiente que for, todos os movimentos acontecem e fluem extremamente bem, sem um único erro ou bug. E até com 4 inimigos a sua frente, é possível enfrentá-los todos ao mesmo tempo, focando todos ao modo que você quiser, através de ataques corpo-a-corpo, longo alcance e magia.Isso já determina as 3 classes, que, apesar de serem poucas, possuem habilidades significativas para cada uma das classes.Exemplo: Não é possível ser Mago do Fogo ou do Gelo, Mago é Mago, você usatanto fogo, como gelo, eletricidade, e até sumona um esqueleto para lhe ajudar.Um fator legal das classes é você poder misturar uma com a outra, podendo fazer um guerreiro + mago, ou assassino + guerreiro, e por ai vai.Mas claro, é possível seguir uma skill tree só, mas eu acho meio chato sinceramente, já que o jogo oferece você poder misturar os combos de cada classe para acabar com os inimigos.O level máximo do jogo é 40, achei baixo, mas é o suficiente para você poder aprender todas as skills da '' árvore '' da sua classe.A quantidade em termos de itens são poucas, porém há muitas variações de um mesmo item, incluindo raros,lendários e os sets ( que fazem parte de um combo de equipamentos ).No jogo também são incluídas facções, que é possível se juntar,assim obtendo mais sidequests e seguir a mainquest dessas facções, são ao total 7 facções no jogo. Descubra por si mesmo auhauhauHá também as cartas, que são obtidas de várias maneiras, e oferecem ao jogador bônus exclusivos, como maior dano, regeneração de vida, e por ai vai.Dentro desse esquema existem também as lorestones, que contam poesias e poemas sobre Amalur, achando um set completo de lorestones, você ganha bônus para algo específico também,Falei muito bem dele até agora, mas KoA contém seus pontos negativos também.Um deles é o Summon da skill de Mago, que aparentemente não fica maior ou mais parrudo quanto mais ele upa, ele aprende novos combos para abater os inimigos. Achei diferente, porém estou acostumado com os summons parrudos do Diablo II, auahuahuah.Outra coisa são os personagens, todos são muito bonitinhos, coloridos, mas isso é o estilo do jogo mesmo, mas é impossível você ficar horrendo no jogo, é mais fácil ficar com uma aparência bizonha e estranha.Além disso, tem certos NPCs extremamente fracos em relação a personalidade, uns 70% do jogo, então não espere muito deles. Claro que tem alguns que te acompanham pelo resto do jogo, que obviamente vão estar bem melhores que os outros.Não há companions permanentes, só temporários.BUGS malignos, como som atrasado, acontecem algumas vezes, ou também o jogo fica mudo, mas volta ao normal.FInalizando, KoA é um daqueles RPGs que você com certeza não bota fé por não seguir os estilos clássicos como FF, Tactics Ogre, Diablo II, ES,etc.Mas, mostra por um lado, uma obra prima que conseguiu colocar o combate como maior foco do jogo, coisa que poucos não focam e muitos gostariam de ver a ação tomar '' ao vivo '', um mundo incrível para explorar, itens para achar e melhorar e seu personagem, e principalmente, um caminho a escolher para o seu Destino.8/10.

												I'm going to compare this game to Witcher 2 and Skyrim because they are my two favourite RPGs and many people have played them. Secondly, if you're going to buy this game, it goes on sale fairly often so I would suggest waiting for a saleKoA does a lot of things right but a lot is sincerely average:KoA has the option to completely change your character's style and perks at any point meaning that you can change the type of character you have whenever you want to try something new. This is cool but it made me feel like a second playthrough would be fairly pointless as I have already tried all the character builds in one playthrough.Playing through the whole game the environments are beautiful and varied. The look of the game is more animated than Skyrim or the Witcher and this gives it a ""friendlier"" look, this is either good or bad depending on your preference.The fighting mechanic is fun and fairly reactive, being more like the Witcher than Skyrim. You can dodge and mix spells and abilities seamlessly in with melee or ranged combat. I found the game too easy, playing the whole thing on hard and never really struggling, eventually you become so powerful that you cannot be beaten and fighting creatures becomes tedious even though the fighting mechanic is funThe main story line is decent and has some originality but is definitely not on the level of the Witcher (but few games are in my opinion)The faction storylines are fun and to the point but fairly predictableBut the side quests have some cool little twists and original little stories.The soundtrack is terribly repetitive and NPCs like talking during battles which results in you missing half of what they are saying because the background noise is so loudSome reviewers found the voice acting sketchy but I did not notice any problemsThere is a lot of lore to be discovered which is nice for people into that and it isn't thrown in your face so you can ignore it if you wantLastly, you can sell any item to any merchant and they all have unlimited funds (because running around trying to sell things in Skyrim is pretty annoying)Pros:Beautiful environmentsGreat fighting mechanicLots of loreDecent storylineRecustomising your character at any pointCons:Too easy (for a Dark Souls person)Predictable Repetitive soundtrack and some difficulty hearing NPCs explain key story points (which they don't repeat)No point in a second playthroughSo in conclusionKoA is a fun game that I would recommend to any RPG fan, but I personally would not rank it above either Skyrim or the Witcher 2			",45,6,1,4,2,0,4

The voice acting ranges from laughable to good or great.The inventory system leaves much to be desired but isn't any worse than unmodded Skyrim.Overall, it's very enjoyable and doesn't require you to replay to try out the different classes.

												So take World of Warcraft and Fable-esque art style and questing but add dynamic combat mechanics akin to Darksiders or Devil May Cry and you get Kingdoms of Amalur. While the story is somewhat lackluster and dull, the open ended exploration of vivid Amalur and it's treasures/loot make up for it shortcomings. The character builds consist of classic dungeon crawling roles of the Warrior, the Mage and the Rogue or combinations of the three classes which offer unique combat approaches. Unlike other open world RPGs ,like Skyrim, you are able to completely respec a character's perk points (for a fee) if you feel you made a bad decision in their allocation or just want a change of pace. Almost 25 hours into this game and I feel I've only scratched the surface. Great buy!			",94,6,0,11,5,0,10

												One of my favorite games of the last generation. The story may seem nonsensical and the facial expressions of the characters may seem wooden, but it's all more than carried by the superb battle system. It is an absolute joy. One of the best non-turn based battle systems I have ever used. Easily on par with Dark/Demon Souls. It's fast paced and fluid. It just feels good. It makes you feel like an utter badass. You are given 3 archetypes to work with: Mage (clear enough), Rogue (bows, daggers, fast stuff, cool assassiny skills) and Might (great swords, hammers, tanky things). You can go solo in any tree or mix between two or even all three. Putting points in trees unlocks tarot cards as you go on that change how your character functions in fights. The 3rd tarot for a Mage/Rogue hybrid for example changes your roll dodge into a teleport and tarots beyond that adds the ability to poison enemies that you teleport through. It's pretty rad.The game world is also pretty expansive; it'll take you a long time to finish everything. Steam is for some reason saying I've only put 3 hours into the game but I know that I have bare minimum but in 40 hours (lots of airport layovers while travelling) but I'm pretty sure I'm only about halfway through the games content. Lots and lots of questing to do here. Just buy the game. It's a good time.			",29,11,0,5,3,0,1

												Beautifull game that never really got the attention it deserved. Cool looking area`s with a good variaty of enemy`s and large amount of quests to keep you busy. Combined with a very interesting combat system and leveling-up skills that lets you choose between various different playstyles that you can always change whenever you want to (Gold cost goes up after each reset but not too much). Simply a nice world too explore without it making you feel lost like skyrim does. However the game does have a few issues that you need to be aware of. First is saving, there is no autosave, so be sure to save often since you don`t want to lose your progress when it crashes (happened 3 times in 20 hours so its not that bad).Secondly, some quests have weird bugs wich lets you not complete them if you do things in the ""wrong"" order. Most of the times it`s resolved by selling the quest item and then buy it back, but sometimes it just bugs out. There are Forums out there wich can resolve many of these issues, but know that the game has it`s flaws.And thirdly the FOV of this game is very low, but with the program widescreen fixer you can alter it to your own desire, so It`s not as big of an issue but again is an inconvenience that you should know about before buying.All in all a very attractive game you can sink a lot of time in, and definitely a game you should buy or try, as it has a demo.

												If you like the idea of smushing Fable and Zelda together in a world so massive that you'll never finish all the side-quests, if you like GREAT action RPGs instead of FO4 or ES5: Skyrim's shallow, weaksauce bullsh*t, play this game instead. It is much, much better than either of those games will ever be with all their mods installed. Graphics? Sound? Gameplay? Plot? Writing? World size? All AWESOME.There are some caveats:1. Don't take every quest you run across unless you really want to do it. There are simply too many.2. This game REQUIRES a controller. Works well with my generic XB360 controller.3. There is no mod scene nor further patches beyond what's out there. The company tanked.4. You will have to make an account for and log into EA's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t service. Steam handles it more or less transparently after the first time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Forgotten Gem.For a change, I will start my review with the verdict:Great game, a must buy for ANY RPG-Lover!Don’t compare this game with Skyrim or Diablo 3 – that would do this game great injustice.If you look for an RPG with great atmosphere, graphics, audio and hours and hours (and I mean hundreds of hours!!!) of gameplay, look no further!…And this is why…in my opinion:I will try and break down this review in a few categories:Options:Only basic options are available, such as a few sound settings, resolution and few gameplay options…that is about it….not to fancy or complicated. For some players it may be too few options, but I found it a relief that with few tweaks this game can be set to my personal liking.This game was clearly built for a gameconsole (hence the limited settings-options) and to be played with a controller (x-box or similar). It doesn’t play well with keyboard and mouse. With a controller all controls are at your fingertips, whilst with using a keyboard you have to look for the controls. Making use of a controller gives the player an easy and intuitive gameplay.Character customization:Not to many features are available, but just enough to make your own character. Different hairstyles, tattoos and jewellery (like earrings) are provided.You can build your character from scratch or use a template/prefix.With the limited options available, this will only cost you a few minutes.Of course you can also choose gender and race. I only played as a human so I will not review any races. Check the internet for that.Graphics/World:What immediately catches  the eyes, are the vivid colours used in this game.Also the lighting is superb! Neon-like plants etc. light up the landscape.The style used is somewhat cartoonish: lean and slick textures with not to many details.All graphics are in perfect balance.Combine that with a HUGE map and you already have a unique universe to make your own.This game runs very smoothly on maxed out settings on my i5 with 8gb ram and Nvidia 710m laptop.Gameplay:As said before: a controller is a MUST HAVE. The game plays smoothly and relaxed.The map is huge! Sadly there are no mounts (like horses etc.) in this game, so walking is your only option, besides teleporting to locations you have already visited.One more minor issue: you cannot jump. When standing on a cliff or river/lake-side you can only jump down from certain points. Climbing up can only be done by following a predetermined route (like a slope or stairs).Items are hidden everywhere, so exploring every inch of the map is worth it….Hint: boost your “Detect hidden objects” – skill from the start….soon you will be drowning in items, which you can sell for better ones or breakdown into parts and make your own unique items (level your “blacksmith” –skill to get better parts etc.) which you can enchant with magical powers and even give a name….I called my sword “Burning Love”  …..:)Loading happens frequently but takes a very short time. It was not hindering me at all.Multiplayer is not available.Skills/Levelling:What unique is in this game: you can combine any skill with another, without messing up your character. For example: you can build a Warrior Mage (mage with sword-skills etc.) or a combined ranged- and close combat fighter in one mean fighting machine. The choice is yours!When levelling you can choose your skill and/or ability you wish to level/develop. I personally don’t like the big warhammers and VERY BIG blades, so I choose the great sword and shield path….but you can always choose other paths in the skill tree.When, for some reason, you are not happy the way your character developed, you can visit a “Fate Weaver” and COMPLETELY rebuild your character to your liking for a small fee (money is not really a problem in this game). This is quite a more than fantastic feature!Quests:I have the complete edition (so with all 2 dlc packs):Hundreds of (side) quests are available. Some short and easy, some long and more challenging.They are varied enough to make you pursue them. Also the rewards and items are worth it….only downside:  A LOT OF WALKING….and A LOT OF ITEMS….but that comes in handy for selling or crafting your own items.Hint: Complete armorsets of the same type provide bonuses. At its release this game was overshadowed by the launch of Skyrim and shortly after that, Diablo 3.But it does not deserve to go unnoticed! It is a game that deserves a big hand of applause and lots of participating gamers.			",51,0,4,4,5,0,15

												The most epic, colourful and beautiful fairytale I 've seen. Enourmous world, a lot of locations and places of stunning beauty to explore,great plot, style and attention to details and history, yet at the same time without any boring and repeating stories. Along with the main story, there are a lot of !!!!!!! (a whole lot of)!!!!! different quests for factions and just NPCs. With  2 DLCs ( each as big as the main storyline) you can play this game for a very very long time. And this time you'll spend with a great pleasure.			",191,34,4,34,10,0,7

												A gem that I find myself always coming back to. Not a perfect game, but just does so many things well you can't help but want to try every race and class. Pros: Decent graphics. Not breathtaking, but not a lot of buggy nonsense everywhere either.Story is genuinely interesting, and each DLC story makes you yearn to discover more as well.Combat. Holy cow, the combat is fun. There may only be a handful of weapon types, but the way your talents affect them and the combos you can string together is just plain fun. Mixing and matching magic spells with weapons adds some nice flavor as well.There is a LOT to do in this game. Even if you only did the main story it takes a while to finish, but rising through the ranks in the various factions is some of the best parts of the game!Your character's abilites are NEVER set in stone. You can reset everything to try new ability combos at any point in the game.Cons:This game can be very unforgiving. Probably my biggest gripe with this game, is that there is very limited auto-saving, yet many ambushes/surprise events that you can be quite unprepared for. I ragequit many a time after having hours of work sucked away by carelessly forgetting to save, then dying.The voice acting may seem decent at first, but some of the accents and voices get VERY annoying and repetitive. Not the end of the world, but definitely noticeable.At points this game can be grindy, when the level gap between zones is a little too big. One moment you'll feel like a badass, then move to the next zone and get wasted immediately(Then lose a ton of time as previously stated haha sob).Overall, 8.5 / 10I'll take slightly flawed, lesser known game with insane replay value over a big name blockbuster that leaves me yawning after 20 hours anyday.PS- Bought this on Steam after logging 100+ hours into the PS3 version. Cheers everyone!			",147,15,5,14,10,0,13

												This game is wonderful.I picked it up once on a spark of interest and never really got far in it.When I was talking with some friends one day we were talking games and it was mentioned, so I tried again.Worth every hour and penny. The stories, art, and ideas are really very well executed.My only real criticism is that battle can become a touch repetitive and that some aspects are not quite perfect.I enjoyed all the stories, from main, DLC, to minor questlines and factions. The world is pretty detailed and has great backstories to explain it.The art and design is gorgeous. It doesn't try too hard to be HD and it is far enough away from cartoonish art to be really great.Would definitely recommend			",20,3,1,10,9,0,5

												A decent game with bright visuals and a long runtime.  The story is confusing and forgettable, but decent for an RPG.  There are a variety of environments, owing to the size of the map, and a number of different enemies to match it.  The travel system is easy to use.  There's really nothing that I disliked, but it lacks some content and systems that other RPGs have.  Overall, well worth it if you can pick it up for cheap.			",283,69,3,22,10,2,14

												This game is full of content, not to mention if you add the dlc's to it. There is a load of Weapons and Armours, all sorts of items to upgrade with and its great! The leveling up system is very nice and really makes you think about what you're upgrading, For both the combat and the skills.There are many quests to do and so many more side quests, the faction quests are great for lore as well.The final boss fights are very well laid out and make you create a plan of attack, sometimes its fun to just go nuts as well.Of course there are some things that aren't the best, for instance the prices of items and such can be fairly unbalanced and if you are not careful can end up wasting a big chunk of your gold.The camera angles can be tricky to get use to, especially if you play a lot of other games that all use a different camera style. It can be a bit of a nuicence that you can zoom your camera or lock/unlock it.But other then that this game is absolutley amazing, graphically and visually. Audio and musicaly and combat balance and all that, offering a wide variety of content it is a game that is worth buy and spending hours into nights of playing. ",124,20,6,22,11,0,12

												I had heard that this game was too similar to an MMORPG without actually being one to be fun, but these claims were wrong. Certainly, the quest system is a degree like an MMO's, but it was nowhere near as monotonous, and I went through the game doing every quest for every region, and only became tired of that when I had went through every piece of land on the lefternmost (see: largest) continent, and was about 40 hours in. The combat is fantastic. I only played as a warrior, but the moves were so stylish, and made you feel so powerful, that I never got tired of fighting. The challenge is kept consistent all the way through, and the gameplay and character customization overshadow the admitably awful story and characters (that fortune-teller dude that follows you throughout the game is badass, though, as is your gnome buddy). I strongly recommend this. One playthrough, including DLC, will get you 50+ hours, and it is certainly replayable.			",83,19,0,29,11,0,33

												Kingdoms of Amalur is a good Action-RPG in its own right. It has plenty of loot drops, a very action oriented battle system and a very good skill tree.The skills are fun to explore and satisfying to combine, to find your own playstyle.The quests usually range from killing X to talk to Y and fetch Z. Nothing new here. The game features a huge map, which is unfortunately not a single map, like in Skyrim, but large Zones that are connected without a loading screen. Art style and graphics are very colourful, yet gorgeous, comic-esque. And although it looks a little like Torchlight, it features rather bloddy finishing combos. If you are in need of easy action without a deep story KoA might capture you for hours, until something ""better"" comes along. It's not Skyrim and it does not try to be, but it's also not as mature, deep and tantalizing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For some reason when I first got this game I thought it would be similar to skyrim, but I soon realized it is very different.  the artwork and music of the game was just so unique and the character animations were so sleek.  The way you play the game makes it so you can make many different combinations of attacks with many different weapons.  There can be quite a few ways to play through the game.  The only complaint I would have is that it's too easy to just make your own weapon that will just make it very easy to kill enemies.  Trust me if you want a challenge while playing this game then don't invest in smithing.			",62,5,0,7,4,2,4

												Fun game that's definitely worth trying if you're looking for a good action RPG. The DLC is fun, though maybe a bit short if purchased at full price. The graphics (especially for an older game) and story are solid, though not as good as something like Witcher. One of the biggest things that I like about the game are that the combat, while not necessarily the most complex, is fun and customizable depending on your preferred style of play. The other biggest pro for me is the amount of character progression, in terms of the look of your character, the gear that you get, and the talents/abilities that unlock over time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning came out at a bad time. It was only about 3 months after Skyrim launched and most western RPGs now had a new king to contend with. This game fell under the radar and the studio closed even, which is unfortunate as this is a great game.Penned by R.A. Salvatore the world of Amalur is familiar enough for a traditional western RPG player but different enough in it's storytelling to be just compelling enough to keep on playing. Everything is fully voice acted and quite well at that. I personally didn't find myself falling in love with any characters in particular but the story is only one part of this game. One of the other great parts of this game (and in my opinion the main reason to pick it up and play) is the combat. The combat is fast, interesting, and requires a decent amount of strategy. The easiest game to compare it to in terms of combat is God of War. You'll be building combos, countering, and dodging your way to victory with a wide variety of weapons that almost all play differently. Fortunately you can handle two different weapon sets at a time allowing for a significant amount of customization that let's you create a character that fits your play style. Visually, the game is decent. There isn't much in the way of lush foliage like in The Witcher 3 but the color palette is vibrant and on an artistic level the game shines, even if it's not necessarily a technical marvel. Armor and weapons look especially cool even if many modern visual effects aren't present.In terms of getting all the achievements keep in mind that this is an open world RPG. This means very few missable achievements (although there are a few so check a guide beforehand) and several story related achievements. There were some kill grinds which are always fun in addition to semi-collectible achievements. I would also recommend the DLC if you don't mind forking out extra dough. If you can get them on sale even better. You'll also need them to 100% the game on Steam.Overall, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a great western RPG that unfortunately fell under the radar. It's a shame more people didn't play this game because it tells a pretty good story, has some of the best western RPG combat around, and looks pretty good from an artistic point of view. I highly recommend picking this one up especially if you consider yourself an RPG fan.8.5/10			",130,11,3,10,1,0,13

Here's the tl;dr at the top of the post: Kingdoms Of Amalur: Reckoning is absolutely worth your time.Kingdoms Of Amalur: Reckoning is an open-world, action RPG created by the unfortunately defunct 38 Strudios. After booting the game and playing the first extended mission, you will quickly realized that a lot of love went into this game. There's not many games out there that feel like the people who made them were making a game that they simply adored and would want to play themselves. However, this is, without a doubt, one of those rare games.Let's take a look at some bullet points straight from the Steam store page:- Uncover the secrets of Amalur in hundreds of hours of immersive gameplay, from the vibrant city of Rathir to the vast region of Dalentarth to the grim dungeons of the Brigand Hall Caverns.This bullet is not exaggerating with the ""hundreds of hours"" bit. I've easily sunk 63 hours (as of this posting) into the game and I have no idea if I'm close to the end. And you know what? I'm fine with that. The story is engaging and the world is full of awesome locations full of interesting people eager to send you even farther out into the world.One of this game's most amazing strengths is that EVERY SINGLE QUEST has full voice acting. You never have to read a line of text if you don't want to. For me, this keeps the game interesting and pushes me to play farther into the story because I actually care about these characters. For once, the NPCs are not just cardboard cutouts with text attached to their face. It's incredible what a difference that makes.Okay so it has a ton of missions and voice acting, but does it have a world to support these characters and their stories? Hell yes it does! Take a look at this next point of interest:- Explore deep levels of lore in a universe steeped in 10,000 years of fiction created by New York Times bestselling author R.A. Salvatore.Kingdoms Of Amalur has an Elder Scrolls level of world back story. Every book you find has a story written inside them about the towns, cities, people, and invading monsters. Exploration is rewarded with notes written by local townsfolk about their everyday lives, how they came to be, and their personal demons. Some merchants even keep inventory notes that you can peak at. You can spend hours just talking to individual people in the towns and learn how they feel about certain locations, the legends of old, and events that are likely to happen.If you're one who craves lore, this game will not disappoint.Lots of missions: Check. Lots of lore: Check. How about a good combat system: Double Check:- Customize your play in a dynamic combat system that delivers some of the most intense and responsive action ever seen in an RPG.- Seamlessly integrate magical and melee attacks as you take on scores of enemies in grand fight sequences and finish them off with brutal Fateshift kills.The combat system is a hybrid of God Of War and the Fable series. You can move around feely, use two seperate weapons (of any type), and dispense of 4 different magic spells at anytime during battle. There's also a nice blocking mechanic that slows down time and knocks back any enemies around you to give you the upper hand.Combat has a very light locking mechanic as well. All the melee weapons have a 3 to 4 point combo that can be executed by pressing the button at a certain pace. Once you hit someone, the game will softly nudge you to keep you hitting the target. The reason I say ""softly"" is because you can change your direction at any point during an attack. See someone coming up from behind? Whip around and hit him with the final attack from your combo to make sure he doesn't get you with your back turned.Spells vary. There's a ton to choose from. Some are simple character effects, some are projectiles, while others are area of effect attacks. Each has a special visual style and devastating effects that can be upgraded through the abilities tree.The ""Fateshift"" mentioned in the second bullet is a slow-motion mode that is activated once your Fate meter fills up from killing enemies. When Fateshift is activated, you are given increased damage output as you kill as many enemies as you can in the allotted time and then perform a special finisher move to the final enemy. Doing so gives you extra experience points!Alright, so there's one final piece I'd like to talk about, and that's the character building:- Build the character you've always wanted with the revolutionary new Destiny system that allows you to continuously evolve your character class to your style of play.- Create and modify your hero with millions of combinations of skills, abilities, weapons and pieces of armor.When it comes to character classes, there are three main choices: Might (Warrior), Finesse (Rogue), and Sorcery (Magic). You can either fully spec one of these classes, or go for something a bit more interesting and incoperate a little of each. Doing so actually effects some of the class bonuses (called Destinies) you get later in the game.Also, if at any point during the game you get bored of your current class or you want to change your profession, visit a Fateweaver and simply respec every single skill and ability point you've earned so far for a small amount of coin. The game is long, and you'll like want to do this once or twice just to change things up and try something new. It's always nice when a game is flexible.There you have it, my extended thoughts on Kingdoms Of Amalur: Reckoning. Hopefully through this post I've helped alleviate any doubts you may have had about the game and pushed you towards trying a wonderfully crafted RPG full of exciting characters, locations, and monsters. Good luck in Amalur!http://forums.fungineers.net/index.php?topic=1403.msg22646#msg22646 ",266,51,21,20,18,1,16

I strongly recommend this. One playthrough, including DLC, will get you 50+ hours, and it is certainly replayable.			",83,19,0,29,11,0,33

												Kingdoms of Amalur is a good Action-RPG in its own right. It has plenty of loot drops, a very action oriented battle system and a very good skill tree.The skills are fun to explore and satisfying to combine, to find your own playstyle.The quests usually range from killing X to talk to Y and fetch Z. Nothing new here. The game features a huge map, which is unfortunately not a single map, like in Skyrim, but large Zones that are connected without a loading screen. Art style and graphics are very colourful, yet gorgeous, comic-esque. And although it looks a little like Torchlight, it features rather bloddy finishing combos. If you are in need of easy action without a deep story KoA might capture you for hours, until something ""better"" comes along. It's not Skyrim and it does not try to be, but it's also not as mature, deep and tantalizing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I didn't hear anything about this game when it came out (probably because of all the shenanigans around 38 Studios).  It's great fun, though... reminds me of solo'ing on WoW, but with better combat.			",212,40,10,28,23,0,24

												Someone said this game is like a single player MMO where you only do quests. Very good comparison. Fun for a little while, but not enough to hold my interest. Didn't finish. Combat system is rather simple, but lots of variety. Nice combat graphics, but there seems to be an emphasis on appearance over actual challenge.			",96,14,14,38,37,1,37

Here's the tl;dr at the top of the post: Kingdoms Of Amalur: Reckoning is absolutely worth your time.Kingdoms Of Amalur: Reckoning is an open-world, action RPG created by the unfortunately defunct 38 Strudios. After booting the game and playing the first extended mission, you will quickly realized that a lot of love went into this game. There's not many games out there that feel like the people who made them were making a game that they simply adored and would want to play themselves. However, this is, without a doubt, one of those rare games.Let's take a look at some bullet points straight from the Steam store page:- Uncover the secrets of Amalur in hundreds of hours of immersive gameplay, from the vibrant city of Rathir to the vast region of Dalentarth to the grim dungeons of the Brigand Hall Caverns.This bullet is not exaggerating with the ""hundreds of hours"" bit. I've easily sunk 63 hours (as of this posting) into the game and I have no idea if I'm close to the end. And you know what? I'm fine with that. The story is engaging and the world is full of awesome locations full of interesting people eager to send you even farther out into the world.One of this game's most amazing strengths is that EVERY SINGLE QUEST has full voice acting. You never have to read a line of text if you don't want to. For me, this keeps the game interesting and pushes me to play farther into the story because I actually care about these characters. For once, the NPCs are not just cardboard cutouts with text attached to their face. It's incredible what a difference that makes.Okay so it has a ton of missions and voice acting, but does it have a world to support these characters and their stories? Hell yes it does! Take a look at this next point of interest:- Explore deep levels of lore in a universe steeped in 10,000 years of fiction created by New York Times bestselling author R.A. Salvatore.Kingdoms Of Amalur has an Elder Scrolls level of world back story. Every book you find has a story written inside them about the towns, cities, people, and invading monsters. Exploration is rewarded with notes written by local townsfolk about their everyday lives, how they came to be, and their personal demons. Some merchants even keep inventory notes that you can peak at. You can spend hours just talking to individual people in the towns and learn how they feel about certain locations, the legends of old, and events that are likely to happen.If you're one who craves lore, this game will not disappoint.Lots of missions: Check. Lots of lore: Check. How about a good combat system: Double Check:- Customize your play in a dynamic combat system that delivers some of the most intense and responsive action ever seen in an RPG.- Seamlessly integrate magical and melee attacks as you take on scores of enemies in grand fight sequences and finish them off with brutal Fateshift kills.The combat system is a hybrid of God Of War and the Fable series. You can move around feely, use two seperate weapons (of any type), and dispense of 4 different magic spells at anytime during battle. There's also a nice blocking mechanic that slows down time and knocks back any enemies around you to give you the upper hand.Combat has a very light locking mechanic as well. All the melee weapons have a 3 to 4 point combo that can be executed by pressing the button at a certain pace. Once you hit someone, the game will softly nudge you to keep you hitting the target. The reason I say ""softly"" is because you can change your direction at any point during an attack. See someone coming up from behind? Whip around and hit him with the final attack from your combo to make sure he doesn't get you with your back turned.Spells vary. There's a ton to choose from. Some are simple character effects, some are projectiles, while others are area of effect attacks. Each has a special visual style and devastating effects that can be upgraded through the abilities tree.The ""Fateshift"" mentioned in the second bullet is a slow-motion mode that is activated once your Fate meter fills up from killing enemies. When Fateshift is activated, you are given increased damage output as you kill as many enemies as you can in the allotted time and then perform a special finisher move to the final enemy. Doing so gives you extra experience points!Alright, so there's one final piece I'd like to talk about, and that's the character building:- Build the character you've always wanted with the revolutionary new Destiny system that allows you to continuously evolve your character class to your style of play.- Create and modify your hero with millions of combinations of skills, abilities, weapons and pieces of armor.When it comes to character classes, there are three main choices: Might (Warrior), Finesse (Rogue), and Sorcery (Magic). You can either fully spec one of these classes, or go for something a bit more interesting and incoperate a little of each. Doing so actually effects some of the class bonuses (called Destinies) you get later in the game.Also, if at any point during the game you get bored of your current class or you want to change your profession, visit a Fateweaver and simply respec every single skill and ability point you've earned so far for a small amount of coin. The game is long, and you'll like want to do this once or twice just to change things up and try something new. It's always nice when a game is flexible.There you have it, my extended thoughts on Kingdoms Of Amalur: Reckoning. Hopefully through this post I've helped alleviate any doubts you may have had about the game and pushed you towards trying a wonderfully crafted RPG full of exciting characters, locations, and monsters. Good luck in Amalur!http://forums.fungineers.net/index.php?topic=1403.msg22646#msg22646 ",266,51,21,20,18,1,16

												I was looking for a Fantasy Rpg to play and found this, I'd finished Skyrim and was looking for another great experience. While it didn't live up to my expectations (which were probably far to high considering what I was comparing it to) but I found it nevertheless to be an enchanting game, beautiful music, wonderful scenery, nice graphics, combat had just enough variety to not be tedious and boring. My favorite part of it all would have to be going around finishing side quests after the main story. Besides Skyrim I've never actually enjoyed this process in other games, it just felt repetative beating foe after foe with my godlike powers, but in this, the music and scenery just made it magical. I'd reccomend this to anyone wanting a Fantasy Rpg  game that's comfortable and fun to play. 8/10			",71,7,0,21,17,1,27

												Fun game that's definitely worth trying if you're looking for a good action RPG. The DLC is fun, though maybe a bit short if purchased at full price. The graphics (especially for an older game) and story are solid, though not as good as something like Witcher. One of the biggest things that I like about the game are that the combat, while not necessarily the most complex, is fun and customizable depending on your preferred style of play. The other biggest pro for me is the amount of character progression, in terms of the look of your character, the gear that you get, and the talents/abilities that unlock over time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For some reason when I first got this game I thought it would be similar to skyrim, but I soon realized it is very different.  the artwork and music of the game was just so unique and the character animations were so sleek.  The way you play the game makes it so you can make many different combinations of attacks with many different weapons.  There can be quite a few ways to play through the game.  The only complaint I would have is that it's too easy to just make your own weapon that will just make it very easy to kill enemies.  Trust me if you want a challenge while playing this game then don't invest in smithing.			",62,5,0,7,4,2,4

												Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning came out at a bad time. It was only about 3 months after Skyrim launched and most western RPGs now had a new king to contend with. This game fell under the radar and the studio closed even, which is unfortunate as this is a great game.Penned by R.A. Salvatore the world of Amalur is familiar enough for a traditional western RPG player but different enough in it's storytelling to be just compelling enough to keep on playing. Everything is fully voice acted and quite well at that. I personally didn't find myself falling in love with any characters in particular but the story is only one part of this game. One of the other great parts of this game (and in my opinion the main reason to pick it up and play) is the combat. The combat is fast, interesting, and requires a decent amount of strategy. The easiest game to compare it to in terms of combat is God of War. You'll be building combos, countering, and dodging your way to victory with a wide variety of weapons that almost all play differently. Fortunately you can handle two different weapon sets at a time allowing for a significant amount of customization that let's you create a character that fits your play style. Visually, the game is decent. There isn't much in the way of lush foliage like in The Witcher 3 but the color palette is vibrant and on an artistic level the game shines, even if it's not necessarily a technical marvel. Armor and weapons look especially cool even if many modern visual effects aren't present.In terms of getting all the achievements keep in mind that this is an open world RPG. This means very few missable achievements (although there are a few so check a guide beforehand) and several story related achievements. There were some kill grinds which are always fun in addition to semi-collectible achievements. I would also recommend the DLC if you don't mind forking out extra dough. If you can get them on sale even better. You'll also need them to 100% the game on Steam.Overall, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a great western RPG that unfortunately fell under the radar. It's a shame more people didn't play this game because it tells a pretty good story, has some of the best western RPG combat around, and looks pretty good from an artistic point of view. I highly recommend picking this one up especially if you consider yourself an RPG fan.8.5/10			",130,11,3,10,1,0,13

												This is one masively underrated RPG in my opinion.  A massive world full of people, factions, quests to do, places to explore and experiences to be had, it never received the due praise that it should have received.Possessing a truly original and authentic story and set in a vibrant world, I keep coming back to this game for more.  A non-linear leveling system that actually lets the player customize the game around their own playstyle, and a Fate system that allows for either further customization and giving the player a sence of accomplishment.  I wish more RPGs could be as well thought out and beautiful as this one.For a single playthrough to experience a near full clear will take well over 100 hours, and that does not even touch the DLC.  At $40, this is an RPG YOU HAVE TO TRY.  The demo includes not only the starter ""tutorial area"", but after that you can take to the first zone for 45 minutes and do ANYTHING you want - quests, crafting, gathering, killing NPCs, whatever your heart desires.I cannot say enough great things about this game.  I wish everyone could get as lost in a single game as I did (and still do) with Kingdoms of Amalur.			",168,15,2,18,6,2,12

												This is pretty late to the game, since Kingdoms has been out for years now, but I think it's important to review a game I love this much. I have more hours into this game than almost any other, and for good reason. The story is pretty extensive, and the sidequests are mostly worth doing, unlike some more recent RPG's.Pros:-Good main storyline-Easy to learn combat system-Excellent DLC-A weapon crafting system that makes your efforts count-Ability to respec easily later in the gameNeutral:-Built-in level cap doesn't allow for maximized characters-Even without maxed abilities, the game isn't difficult to beatCons:-The side stories are extremely repetitive and predictable-Speed is heavily favored over powerI know not everyone will agree with some of my points, especially the last one. But those are my takes on it. I have played it all the way through, and have created many characters, and I have just loved it.			",69,14,0,17,16,0,15

												★★★☆☆When i was playing mass effect 2 on xbox 360, I had chance to play kingdoms of amalur (as KOA) demo version. And this demo game gave me a good time. So i bought this one. Anyway that's personal history. :) Return to the subject, 'KOA' presents the new fantasy world about 'Rule of Cycle', 'Immortal Fea', 'Crystal War', 'Fateless One'... and so on. And these things are showed with beautiful graphic (not mean good quality).Also this game contains many thing to do. After tutorial, you will be faced a lot of quests. Even sometimes these quests make me confusing. You can collect regents or shards to create potions or gems. And you can breakdown equipment and salvage gears to make weapons or armors.And battle system is good. Even this is a RPG game. You can against your enemy by combo, air combo, combat ability and reckoning mode. Various weapons, skills, destinies (like specialized jobs) give you joyful choice. Even you think 'I made a wrong choices', don't worry, you can return to level 1 with all skill points. And reckoning mode is awesome, you become a powerful one and you can do fate-shift (like finish blow). I always felt catharsis when i finished a strong enemy by fate-shift.But 'KOA' also has bad things. First and Worst thing is '38 Studios (developer of 'KOA') was closed without 'KOA' licence sold. That means no more updates, DLCs and 'Kingdoms of Amalur II' :(And character customization is awful. May be, you have bad feeling, when you make your player. Because character customization has very little selections to make your face. Then your worry become a problem of game play. You can see  a NPC what have exactly same your face with different hair color. But that's not a problem, i can imagine he is a my doppelganger or unknown my brother who was seperated at childhood (in game story). But real problem is same faces NPCs are too many to focus story line. For example, You will meet a mentor who guide you in arcana faction quest, and he will send you to the archimage. (I skip many things to prevent spoiler). Then... you will see a same mentor face archimage with white hair. WTF, Even they are major NPCs of faction quest, they have same face!!! except hair color!!!! This problem will teases you until final battle.Other thing is the low level cap. If you are a person who complete all quest in the game (not repeat quests), you can reach level 40 (max level), soon. In my case, i could reach level 40 after siege of mel senshir. Probably i could do that because i finished 'The Legend of Dead Kel' and 'Teeth of Naros' before cross the ocean. Then i lost my purpose of side quests and battles. Level cap must be higher than level 40 to make player can push forward.Anyway 'KOA' is a good RPG game. If it was not, i didn't get all achievements of this game. 'KOA' is a new IP game what has potential to be a great franchise game. But it's a shame, future of 'KOA' is unclear.			",82,8,2,10,2,0,9

												Initial review when halfway through the game:More epic than Torchlight, less epic than Morrowing/Oblivion/Skyrim.Although KoA is not as epic and deep as the other famous titles in this genre, and the battle mechanics take some time getting used to, I would highly recommend this game! KoA has a more linear storyline, with fast travels, character customization, quests that are easy to follow.Followup review:After 74.6 hours of play, and with the main quest completed, I felt exhausted. The first 40 hours of the game was fantastic, absolutely loved it. However, once you get to the 60% mark of the game, the whole thing starts to get repetative. I stopped doing side quests and did not bother reading the dialouge between characters. All I wanted to do was to complete the main quest. Probably because I used melee set-up throughout the game and hence the game got boring for me. I never tried the ""mage"" or ""theif"" set-ups (you can change set-ups anytime during the game). And at the 60% mark of the game, the world started to get really big. You had to waste 20+ seconds to run from the entrance of the building to reach someone.During combat, the camera tends to 'fly' around. I couldn't see what my character was doing and the actions of my enemies.That being said, I still enjoyed the game. The game was not difficult and I had no issues completing the game comfortably on 'normal' mode. The game not was buggy at all, apart from one insignificant side quest where I was not able to complete because it kept crashing my game when I tried to 'light up the cactus"". Summary: Kingdoms of Amalur was definitely worth my money and time.			",4,1,0,2,3,0,2

												I don't know where to start but this game is best RPG I've ever played. Please don't ask me about Skyrim this is my personel opinion. Whatever, let's start: • 4 races to play.• 3 skill trees Might, Finesse & Sorcery. (You can be three of them if you want)• Fighting system like Darksiders.• Epic boss fights. • A great story, never got bored while playing. • A huge world to explore. (Better with DLC Packs)• Amazing animations. • And the best part, insane finishing moves while in Reckoning Mode! So, you MUST buy this game if you wanna feel the real action. Trust me, you won't regret it!			",565,97,17,41,29,3,31

												Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is one of the best RPG games I've played in a long time. Skyrim didn't really catch me, but Amalur has. I don't know if it's the combat style or the atmosphere or just the storytelling that makes this game great or if it's the great combinations of these. Anyway, this is a great RPG and most likely a candidate to ""Best Game of the Year 2012"".			",2793,1141,113,313,384,38,430

												Fun and dynamic combat-system with cringeworthy writing and uninviting corridoor maps tacked on in an attempt to create an RPG. The combat alone was engaging enough to play past the point where I started to hate the writing and claustrophobia was creeping in, but in the end I gave up hope that things would change and skill and gear progression made the fights too easy. A real let-down, this game, but I give it points for effort in the combat department. [4/10]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning (KoA) is probably one of the best games I've ever played and ever will. Soon after you fall down into a pile of bodies and miraculously come back to life your pitted in a war against the people of Amalur and the Tuatha. The Tuatha are a race of the Fae that have been corrupted. You start with one area gathering armor, weapons, supplies, allies, ingredients, crystals, and other different nouns and items. There is a great leveling up system that gives you unique and different abilities. I never got the hang of dispelling or lock-picking so I'd recommend upgrading those early so you can force them. Let's also talk about how there are lore stones that give you background information on the land around you. You'll enjoy your time in KOA from becoming a witches husband or the hero of the Warsworn. There's also a achievement if you talk to someone with nothing equipped so that's cool. If you'd like to discuss more about the game feel free to friend me. It's worth whatever amount of money you pay for it. Rate 10/10 Rank The Best			",37,3,0,9,2,0,1

												Alright, well, here we go, I bought this game under the impression it was open world, and had RPG elements, which it did have on both accounts, HOWEVER, After playing for 20 hours I came to a realization, this game is monotonous, it feels like ive been doing the same side quest 50 TIMES, the main story itself was intriguing, and combat is fairly fluid and dynamic, the class system in this game is different to say the least.To summarize, I came away from this game the same way I came away from Skyrim, its alot of fun, until you do everything, the choices you make have no real consequence, and the world seems HUGE on the map, but the reality is, its just large open (or semi-closed) spaces with the same brands of monsters scattered throughout the world at large, there is a backstory, but your so caught up in everything, you dont see it, I recomend this game when its onsale (for like 10$) but otherwise 7/10			",52,5,0,9,3,1,14

												The game is actually pretty great and I would love to recommend it but it also managed to provide me with some of the most frustrating gaming experiences I've ever had, enough for me to just uninstall it after 30 hours of play time.  There are several bugs in the game that there are no fixes for and which get you stuck, permanently.  So if you didn't make a separate save (not auto-save) then you basically have to start over.  The first time it happened I had a save from like 10 hours previous, very frustrating but I kept playing.  Then it happened again on another quest.  It just blows my mind that the developers don't even acknowledge it, let alone try to issue a patch for it.			",68,57,0,14,1,0,1

												This is a surprisingly good game. If you're into RPGs and you see it on sale, grab it! A controller is highly recommended!My one complaint is that I wish there was more combat cause it's a lot of fun. I often want to jump right into another mob and just keep going. Otherwise there's a lot this game gets right. The quick travel is a great feature. I mean, who wants to spend hours just running back and forth. With this, you just click on points of the map and go. So much more to say, but I want to get back to gaming. So stop reading and go buy it!			",318,160,1,117,68,3,119

												Underdog detected :)PROS- Truly HUGE world.- An amazing amount of quests, a lot to do- Three classes with that play very differently because of their skills- High polish and optimisationCONS - Weird to say but the game is so huge that sometimes it can be discouraging :) But this is not really a con, mostly we have been playing short games for so long that we lost the attention span required to play a game for weeks.- Some of the lore can be boring sometimes. I find the fae to be a boring race for exemple, bunch of broken record playing the same songs again and again. But it fits the story and the world setting, i just wish there were more diversity in the culture of the world.REVIEWThis is a huge game and deserves a long review, but lacking the time suffice to say that it is an excelent RPG, and fairly unique in the way it tastes like an MMO because of its scale.I am not sure why this title didn't do better, I can't recall but i think at the time it came out there were 3-4 big titles coming out also and they completely overshadowed this game. I guess most people didn't have the budget or the gaming time for another 60$ title. I only grabbed this recently because it went on sale, and certeinly don't regret it. I got about 90 hours out of it already after finishing it (not a full clear mind you, a lot of quests and some exploration still left over), and I still have the DLCs set aside.Some advice : If you get slightly bored in your play, respecialize as another class. I went through all the 3 classes in my single playthrough, and it helped keep things fresh. The game certeinly doesn't warrant a playthrough with each class as it would be too repetitive, so might as well experience all classes on the same go.			",360,75,5,72,42,2,66

												Ever wanted to play a MMO completely solo?  Imagine this:  The feel of World of Warcraft, except that actions you take have final repercussions.  Combine this with a frantic combat system not unlike God of War, a quest system as rich as Skyrim and a loot table that puts Diablo to shame.KoA:Reckoning is all that.  You play the role of the Fateless one, a being who, through story events have been removed from the grand tapestry of fate.  What you become is entirely up to you, the class and skill system is absolutely limitless.The soundtrack is spotless, the music is great and greatly enhances the mood.  The voices are a mixed bunch; most of them are very well done but a few NPCs here and there make you want to reach and punch them.  Graphics are another issue that could annoy some people; the world and environment are absolutely gorgeous and involving, but the character textures could be better, looking somewhat dated.  Nevertheless, you'll find the originality of the world design to be quite unique and vastly apart from the usual elf/dwarf/orc/dragon fantasy games.As for the single biggest flaw this game has: it's entirely too easy.  Even on hard mode, a well built mage will steamroll against pretty much everything.  It didn't bother me mind you, once in a while it's fun to just go around, watching my cute little dokkalfar owning everything as I cackle like a maniac.  I may or may not be taking pills for that.Grab it during the summer sale and play it.  It's a gem.			",39,13,1,12,0,0,3

												I love it. You might like it. Its a MMO without the MMO issues. It's shame we will not see a sequal since 38 Studios went bankrupt after this game was made. Mainly because this game didn't sell as well as it needed to. I think in the end it would have made a really interesting MMO.Some of the quests really show that it was suppose to be an MMO but you can ignore that fact of collecting 10 bear asses because the combat is fun.I'm about to reinstall it after years of not playing it to play it again which when you think about it, that's a good thing. If someone who beat it once and hasn't played it for a long time is going to play it again, I think that is good game design.

												It's a pretty average game. The Graphics and world building are top notch. The combat and balancing was unique but not fully engaging. It became monotonous and I just ran past most of the fights towards the end. I suggest this game to people who really like RPGs. If you don't like RPGs, I don't think there's much here you'll enjoy.The story and writing is a bit inconsistent. The sidequests are written brilliantly while the main story is rather dry. The combat isn't bad, but it's not good. It was never balanced properly. So your character will be OP for about 90% of the game no matter what you pick. Combat is more of a pacing mechanic than a  meaty gameplay element. You'll find yourself simply running past enemies to fulfill quests since enemies become time sinks rather than challenges.It was the quintessential mediocre RPG. Not too good, not too bad, with proper pacing so you never get stuck doing something you don't want to do.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A very fun game. Rich lore, interesting storyline, various unique creatures and weapons. There are 3 main playstyles that vary considerably. If you want you can focus on one of the 3 or you can split it up between. There are so many possibilities, cool moves and useful spells. It has a solid blacksmithing and alchemy component to it, as well as something called sagecrafting where you can create gems that will power up your items. Because most people are going to know what its like compared to Skyrim I guess I'll have to talk about that. In my opinion the combat is more rich. There's dodging, and blocking with sheilds is actually worth it and plays into your attacks if timed right. Also it feels way less hack and slash than Skyrim, there a different moves that when applied correctly can turn the tide of what might have seemed an unwinnable fight. The game auto-aims for you, but that doesn't detract from the fighting experience at all. The spells are also more interesting than Skyrim's. Skyrim might have more spells but they end up all feeling the same while KoA:R's are all unique and have very powerful uses in certain situations. Kingdoms has an amazing world to explore. It is a bit small compared to Skyrim and doesn't allow for as much freedom (for example you can only jump down from cliffs and walls at certain points on the map) but it is something you get used to and it helps with where the game really excels: combat, because you are channelled towards groups of enemies. The graphics are fairly decent and the game runs smoothly. I did run into a bug where you get stuck and cannot move at all and have to fast travel to get out of the place and the general pop in distance for enemies could be a bit longer, perhaps there is a way to change this in the .ini files or something, I'll have to check. The lipsyncing of characters is sometimes off and occassionally they make really awkward movements when speaking, which are a bit immersion breaking. The voice acting is quite good though like all RPGs I really wish they could have used a greater variety of voice actors. Overall its a great experience and I'm quite addicted to it so far. There are so many choices and I feel as if I will do a bunch of playthroughs with vastly differing character builds to get the whole experience. Oh that brings me to one last thing. You can ""unbind your fate"" for a relatively cheap gold cost to reset your points. This means if partway through a playthrough you got sick of smashing people with giant swords you could pay a bit of gold and change your character into a stealthy assassin or a flashy mage.

												Great Fun! The characters are pretty wooden, although they try to add some humor, that said the most humor I have is smashing down anyone, yes you can smash down almost every character. This can detriment the game a little, I smashed some people in a market and missed the chance at an inventory, but at the same time I smashed some blind followers on an island and got good armor.I found one breaking bug on the Dead Kel DLC, didn't bother me too much cause the game is so fun, also take it of full screen mode but keep the native resolution to reduce the frame rate issues, it doesn't actually take it out of full screen  but solves issues. What I like is that it doesn't try to be realistic or serious, like ahmm, oh no there's a big dragon. You've got dialogue choices where you can belittle characters for taking themselves too seriously, more fun. I have a sword that's bigger than me and ancient frisbies.As I said it's fun and funny, the beasts look incredible and they're diverse, the combat makes you feel like a megalith, you can become very overpowered very quickly, but you can challenge yourself by resetting your class and reassigning points or mixing your class up.I really enjoy this game, it's fantasy, colorful, full of loot and funny. It constantly reminds you, that you are in a fantasy world and absolutely rips into it if you want.I disagree it's anything like an MMORPG, it laughs at itself, it laughs at RPG's and then say's cause it's fun and that's the way it's meant to be. If you're looking for a game that's bright, energetic, fun and funny, doesn't take itself to seriously, I find that it is a bit like the Borderlands of the fantasy realm with more dialogue choice and I love borderlands.

												EDIT: After playing more, I can safely say I do really enjoy this game. It's very charming in its own way and the world is pretty big. At the time of this review I've played about 30 hours and I'm only level 10 and still in the starting land!There are some bugs, the camera angle can be annoying at times, auto target is a bit wonky, I really dislike the short render distance (it was ported from consoles so the textures pop in at short distances... just annoying) But overall this is an ""underrated"" game if I ever saw one. It's a slightly flawed gem that should have gotten more attention. I was very sad to learn the studios went bankrupt after making this game because it didn't sell enough copies :( If it had gotten more attention it would have been given the love it deserves. The guy who made this game put all his savings and time into it and it ""failed."" So sad.PROS:-Pretty big world with about 10,000 years of backstory/lore (literally)-Graphics actually look pretty nice-""Cartoony"" look sort of like Fable or Torchlight-Pretty good voice acting-SOOOO many quests and stuff to do! -Nice easy to learn skill system and flexible for any type of playstyle-Works 100% with a gamepad or controller (I myself use an XBOX controller)-RPG elements like a dialogue wheel and choices that affect quests/story-Unique story with a fairly interesting plot-Celtic mythology and lore which you don't see in many games(I myself am Irish so maybe I'm biased...)CONS:-Short render distance so textures pop in obviously all the time-Kind of weird camera angle FOV but there is a mod which fixes that-Some dialogue is a bit cheesy or repetitive now and then... but I find it hilarous :)-Silent main character... this is a con for me because it's quite awkward to have your character just stare at people during dialogue-Combat is a bit tricky.. sometimes it's difficult and sometimes too easy... Basic wolves and other ""fodder"" are the most annoying enemy in the game, while single bosses are easy peasy-Pehaps a bit too much reading, VERY dialogue and text heavy at timesI would still give it about an 8/10. If you like Skyrim, Fable, and Celtic mythology you would definitely enjoy this game :)			",63,24,0,14,7,0,3

												Very good RPG. Suffers from the MMO syndrome, lots of quests not related to the plot. Open world-ish, with significant amount of things to do, but quite repetitive if you are not used to MMO's. Three main classes, that can combine to form variants (And these variants are supported by the game, wich is nice), lots of perks, crafting, weapons with very cool and unique abilities and skins.Story is terribly cliche, but all in all it's very fun to play.Totally recommand for anybody that is a minimum used to the MMO system.

												Just finished with both add-on`s. Took me about 190 hours of decent fun. Sorry for my English - not my main. Beware of small spoilers.Game is HUGE. World is very interesting yet main storyline seems like ""I did that few times already"". I mean, for example, Fae (naming them just Amalur`s Elves does not give justice to their concept) and their life cycle. How they preserve history and traditions by repeating battles and happenings from long gone past, making them to reappear in endless cycle. Unable to reach for something new. Great and tragic at the same time. House of Ballads storyline is extraordinary. While main quest, tho has its moments, drives us to meat final Great Evil like so many before. Don`t get me wrong - it`s fine but nothing as extraordinary as some other parts of the game.I like fighting system. Played melee fighter. You can really create Your own style. And while most enemies can hit hard at the beginning of the game, all of them can be killed. When I died it was always because of my own fault. Problem is, later on there are no real challenges. The only achievement I didn`t get through normal playthrough was the one to kill enemy 4 levels higher then me. Thanks to scalling system I haven`t found one. On the other hand main hero is somewhat unique figure in the world of Amalur so maybe it was intended by devs to make god-like impression.Can`t say something about magic - haven`t been using that at all. I really liked minigames of picking locks and dispelling. Crafting is very usefull tho crafted items make game even more easy. So up to after Mel Senshir I used Alchemy to craft potions only. Then I made final tier crafts and my charactered trippeled its stats. So whoever wishes to make game more of a .... hmm no, not challenge.... rather more humanlike - do not craft. Whoever wishes to become one man army+++ please do.To sum up. I spend with this game 190 hours and I`m not masochist. So it means i like it pretty much. For World created, for Lore (mostly unused), for Fae storyline, for Dead Kel, for fighting. for many small things making it great rpg experience. And being god-like figure is not so bad after all ;)			",1687,659,39,260,147,8,308

												Good graphics, nice music, varying enemy types, entertaining quest dialogue, nice skill tree and class/job system. It can get very dull after long periods of play in my opinion, I just thought it was slow paced at times. I found it hard to stay invested and interested in the story of the main questline or side quests. Combat is fun and somewhat simple and can get repetetive sometimes, but at the time I write this review I went full might skill tree, Warlord, so I have yet to experience the finesse and sorcery skill trees enough to adequately judge all combat styles in this game as a whole.PROS:Graphics.Gameplay.Good music.Varied environments.Large game map.Simple and easy ui (quest log, game map, inventory, junk tab, etc.).Lots of loot to dig through, if that's your thing (I know it's mine).""You are what you play"" class system. You can go full warrior, rogue, mage, or do a bit of all 3, or a bit of two. It's all up to you. Not to mention there's a lore based method to reskill your character; you don't have to make a new character to switch up your playstyle.varied quest objectives, be they personally engaging with the quest NPCs or having you run to the end of a cave and retrieve an heirloom (chances are you know the kind).CONS:Slow paced.Gets dull after extended play sessions (at least in my opinion).You can't abandon quests once you get them; once they're in your quest log, you're stuck with it.It's WAY too easy to get filthy rich in this game. Just loot every little thing you come across that you don't want and pawn it. Before you know it you'll be rich. Like, Bill Gates rich.If this game is on sale, definitely get it. I picked it up when it was on sale for just 5 bucks, and it feels like a steal.I'm no video game journalist, just a gamer. I would give this an 8/10.Replay value: moderately high.Hours played at the time of this review: 107 hours.			",153,12,2,34,4,0,1

												Man, what a unique concept. The entire game storyline is gripping. The writers really outdid themselves.The gameplay is pretty standard in between fights, but the combat is stellar. Alternating between two weapons is seamless, combos get more varied as the game progresses, and skills/spells are easy to use and useful.			",152,19,0,41,7,0,38

												This game briefly felt like everything fable was promised to be by Peter Molyneux. I often fondly remember the fun I had in this game, lamenting that this is a story that will never be finished. An heavily story driven, action hack and slash RPG, with some over the top, beautiful animations and spell effects.If I had to equate this to something, imagine if Dragon Age met Fable. Pretty good, definately worth a look if you enjoy fantasy games.			",561,179,13,60,38,6,97

												Got this game for under $10 on special and what a bargain!I’ve bought other games for more and been finished in 6 hours or less, so this really gives value for money.If you enjoy games like the Witcher or Gothic series, then you'll enjoy this as it has a similar feel but also has some unique features like the “Reckoning Mode”.Had read some posts about bugs, but after 140hrs of game play only came across one bug and that was the Eathe mission where I spoke with her too early and she got stuck in the Cistern, making another quest unachievable. (but no big deal as I ended up with over 240 completed quests anyway)In the end I maxed out on level 40 about 6 hours before the end of the game, so pretty well spot on. Some of the side quests drag on a bit, but you can miss these altogether if you want to.Found the game to be addictive at times and was easy to spend all day/night playing. Would totally recommend this one.Get the whole bundle and have some fun...			",108,18,9,5,6,0,9

												Wow, Kingdoms of Amalur was a GOOD game. From beging to end i never felt that this game really deserved the bad rap that it got. However I do understand that this game has its issues and there are far more polished and more sophistcated RPG titles out there. But i blieve the late 38 studios did a great job with this title, with this being its first and now only ever game the company has produced i blieve it deserves the cult status it has slowly achieved. The story, the lore and the characters is were this game really shines, its ingossing and it makes you feel like you are a part of the world, and i am truely hoping that one day a studio, perhaps Obsedian, will save the franchise and make a much wanted sequal. Now, there are areas that may turn people away, the combat is invigorating at first but quickly becomes quite repedative, and many of the side quests feel like you are just visting the same dungeon and the doing the  same objective over and over again. Although if you just stick to the main quest, you shouldnt come across this problem. The crafting system is also very limited and is pretty forgettable with the game's competitors blowing it out of the park. But that said it isn't bad either. With the fast leveling up, it feels like the crafting becomes more of a novelty in the late game. So in conclusion, 38 studios, now gone will not be forgotten with this hidden gem in Amalur. I blieve the narrative of the game alone is enough to warrent interest from a new studio to give this ip another chance. Over all a good game, with some sub par RPG elements but with an amazing story and lore. Well worth buying during a steam sale. Score: 7.5			",31,4,0,6,0,0,0

												An under the cover game, dwarfed by other releases such as the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, this game should be viewed in greater light and strength. An addictive expansive world fuelled by a real fantastical scenario and setting, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning brings strong RPG elements to an otherwise uncomplicated genre. Though this game is stuck between an MMO and a traditional RPG, its combat, crafting and magical elements make this game a strong condendor for anyone looking to play an addictive, massive world game. The downsides to this game may be considerable for some: the purely linear main campaign, the massive open world with no fast travel and lack of considerable and ultimately interesting quests. Nevertheless, it makes up for these pitfalls in interesting dialogue that is both well tohugh out and witty. It is a real blast for any gamer. 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I never understood why I never heard of this game and no one seemed to play it.  (According to RPS commenters, it had a crappy outsourced demo, was overpriced, came out same time as skyrim.: http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/02/26/why-didnt-everyone-play-kingdoms-of-amalur/#comments )Anyways, I absolutely loved this game.  While I only put 12 hours on my steam copy so far, I probably played ~100 on a different account, and it was some of the most enjoyable gaming I've ever done.Maybe I'm just weird but I love single-player games, and don't really touch multiplayer - I put hundreds of hours into Diablo 1-2-3 offline.  I hear there are a lot of bugs, but I don't remember any.  It was polished, smooth, visually gorgeous and vibrant, and addictive as hell.Combat was just badass.  Seriously, I just saw some of the screenshots on the steam page, and I forgot how amazingly fun combat was, especially with the more unusual weapons like chakras.  This game had one of the most satisfying combat systems I've ever seen.Looks like it's no longer expensive, it's easily worth anything under $20 if you enjoy ARPGs at all, I liken it to Diablo/Torchlight mixed with something like Devil May Cry or fast-paced fluid combat systems.  It's no Elder Scrolls game, but if you play it casually and just expect to grind through a bunch of enemies surrounded by lovely scenery and have fun for a while, it's totally worth it.

												Just got done beating this game, its DLC and numerous side quests.  It's the most fun I've had with a game in quite a while and highly recommend it.  I'm a fan of action RPG games like Diablo, Skyrim, etc. but not too much of a fan of Witcher (too many lengthy story pauses) and Dragon Age (clunky keyboard/mouse combat).This game has a great story woven throughout, and the excellent keyboard/mouse controls coupled with so many places to explore really won me over.   The level designs are excellent and each region of the game world really feels unique.  I also loved the reckoning mode which slows everything down and allows you to perform special kills which were very satisfying.  The character voice narratives are excellently done too.  Quest markers were easy to follow, and didn't experience a single crash during my entire playthrough, unlike with the Gothic and Sacred games which disappointed me in this regard.If I had to give ""slight"" complaints, I would say the overabundance of purple unique items.  Making it more rarer to obtain these unique items would have given a greater sense of excitement when finding one.  Also, you will want to increase the difficulty which is not a usual practice of mine as I typically play games on Casual or Don't Hurt Me mode.  The easiest difficult option in this game is just way to easy.Overall, an outstanding game for those PC gamers who want a great exploratory experience and fun combat to boot.  I work for a living and don't want to be overly challenged when I find some time to game, and this game really hit the mark.  I give this game a 10 out of 10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For 20 hours, I wanted to like this and tried as well. Eventually it became too hard to do so. The world is interesting, but there is too much lore and not enough drama and characterization. The choice of graphical style was very poor and is a complete mismatch to the fairly serious tone. Combat system, skill trees and many other things work well enough, but all collapses in face of the difficulty, or lack of it. It is simply impossible to fail in Amalur, and extremely hard to fall in combat. Crafting is so overpowered that loot becomes inessential and it is easy to kill everything with single clicks. Amalur is not moddable either. There is a difficulty mod, but it actually requires CheatEngine to use!			",153,47,0,24,9,1,36

												I tried this game a bit and I can't say it's a bad angle although at times the camera annoyed me.What I will say about this game is this.  This game apperently came out around the same time as Skyrim and because Elder Scrolls always gets so much hype, people forgot about it I guess.Here's the thing though.  This is not a game you can compare to skyrim.  This is not a true RPG like Skyrim.  This is far more like Fable.Yes, I would definetly compare what I've played of this game heavily to Fable.  It's far more of an adventure style RPG like Fable and if you enjoyed Fable even a little bit but like me always wanted more.  Then I think this game is a good choice.I'm a bit of a loot snob and I prefer elder scrolls series for a few things, total customization, wide world map (this game has walls, lots of guiding walls like Fable does and like Elder Scrolls does not) and HEY, if that guy i just killed was carrying two sword a crossbow and chainmail armor, I want all of that, whatever he was saving for lunch, and the gold in his pocket.Because I am a looter.  Fable doesn't give you that much loot.  This game doesn't give you that much loot.(but hey, the gear is pretty wicked.)TL:DR, This game compares far more to fable then it does to elderscrolls. you like fable style games? buy this.

Posted: December 21, 2014
												So I bought this game a few months ago, not expecting much.  Honestly, I was expecting it to be one of those games I play for a couple of days and then lose interest in.  I was very wrong on that account.  This is actually one of the best, if not the best, RPGs that I have ever played.  There were a few cons of course, but I will get to that in a little bit.  Because The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion was the last RPG I played before this game, I could not help but to make comparisons during my entire time playing this.  In terms of graphics, I found Amalur to be far superior than Oblivion.  When you are walking in caves and you see all of the flora just come to life as you walk past, it is just captivating.  In terms of story line, I would say that they are about equal, but then again, I have not gotten all that far in Oblivion's storyline (I spend most of my time doing the side quests, build my character up some for the really tough bosses).  If I compared Amalur to Morrowind however, I would pick Amalur's storyline anytime.  Because unlike Morrowind, in which the storyline has you do all of these tasks to the point that it feels crazy, Amalur is fairly straightforward.  Voice-acting, I don't really care for.  But from what I can tell, the voice of the characters in Amalur tends to have this almost...ghostly quality?  Almost like you are hearing someone in another room rather than them talking right next to you.  I guess you will either love it or hate, but for me?  I was indifferent.  There are plenty of side quests to take part in, just like in Oblivion.  Like Oblivion, you can take part in faction quests.  Like if you want to be the head of a Mage's guild in Oblivion, then you can do the same for Amalur.  However, while it it can take a few days or so to finish a faction quest in Oblivion, you can knock them out in Amalur in like, a day because the quests are so much easier and there are fewer actual quests to complete for the faction.  There is a huge variety of character customization.  Do you want to play a male or female character?  Go ahead.  Do you want to play as an Elf or a Human?  Go ahead.  If memory serves me right, then I think there are four races to select in Amalur, but the building of the skill-set does not occur until you actually start game play.  Like you do not decide immediately if you want to make your character a mage.  You can decide where you want to place your character's skill alignment later on and even then, you are fully able to go back and change your character's style whenever you want.  If you decide you want a hammer wielding mage, but decide later that you want to have a magic wielding thief or warrior, then you can do that.  I guess now I can get into the overall pro's and con's.Pro's-Absolutely amazing graphics- Wide skill-set available-You can change your skill-set whenever you want with no consequences other than what your character can or cannot wear or what they can do in combat.-Game play tends to be fluid and smooth, particularly with the combat.  You can dodge-roll or teleport out of the way of an attack and the game is not in first-person so you can see more.   I will get to con's later-Once the main storyline is complete, you can still continue on side-quests-Items will not weigh more than others.  While some weapons will impact attack speed, they will still only occupy one item slot in your backpack.  For example, your hammer, while slower in combat than your daggers, will still occupy the same space in your backpack as the daggers.  -There is a hide-helmet option so that even if your character wears a hood or helmet, you will not see it in game play yet you will still have the effects.  I personally loved this feature.-Easier than Oblivion, but the boss fights can still crush you if you are not ready-Good enough that it deserves a sequel-My overall verdict?  I enjoy this game way more than Oblivion.Con's-Camera angles tend to lag every once in a while, to the point where you might have difficulty seeing an enemy-Character may freeze while running.  As in your character will just stop moving while running.  This can be overcome by rolling or teleporting, but it can be troublesome to freeze in the middle of a fight.  Also, this freezing will occur A LOT, and as such you will be rolling or teleporting almost all the time.  It took a couple of days for this to occur to me though.-Voice-acting is so-so.  -From what I have heard, you can only reach level 41.  That is it.  But you can still reset your skill points later on.  Keep in mind though that this means you will not be able to completely max out all skills and abilities.  -I have had difficulty completing a side-quest because every time I try, the game shuts down.  I do need to give it another try though.-Last I checked, the company that developed this game went bankrupt.  So do not expect a sequel or any patches.Overall, I say check this out.  I got it for $9.99 and this game was most definitely worth the price.  It is fun, beautiful, and the ability to change your skill-set helps to take away the pressure of having to stick with one field.   ",28,1,0,14,4,1,13

												So, I missed some things in my previous review. I'm going to break this into parts: Presentation, Story, and Gameplay.Graphically and artistically the game is fine. Nothing about the monsters stand out, but nothing seems phoned in. There are no slow downs. Sound design is fine and the voice acting isn't too bad but........The cutscenes have that dreaded eagle-eye stare. It's like Oblivion except worse. Additionally, the music is fine until you start fighting people. The combat music is exactly the same for every encounter, even the nobody stuff that you can one hit. The only two times I've seen the music change is when you are fighting the Tuatha or a boss. The two other songs are better and actually have some love put into them.The biggest and most glaring problem is the camera. I'll discuss it below with gameplay.The story is about.. um... The elves-I mean Fae! The Fae are broken up into factions and they are timeless, ageless.. yadda yadda. One group, the Winter Fae, has broken off into a new group, the Tuatha, who believe they are bringing a new god into the world. You, the player, are killed and brought back to live by the Well of Souls.Here's where the game gets interesting story wise: Since you were brought back to life, you are no longer tied to the shackels of fate. You can choose your own destiny and change the fate of the... Wait a second, this sounds a lot like Raziel from the Legacy of Kain series. In fact, the concept is exactly the same. With real free will, your character is supposed to change the world. This works really well in the world, and it plays nice.However, the gameplay is flawed. This game was clearly rushed out because a lot of it has zero consideration. Polish wise, everything functions, but there are a lot of things that are out of place. It's really, really easy to gain gold, to the point that you can respect everything into crafting abilities to make new gear, then respec back to your combat stuff. Don't bother with the warrior or mage trees at all, just make a finese character because the dual weapons + bow and arrows are literally the best weapons in the game. By 10 hours in, you'll have so much gold you can easily respect to fit your builds.Now, developers, I have a question for you: Does making the game world bigger make it better? Lemme answer for you.. NO!!!! Reckoning has a low run speed.. But so did Skyrim! But here's the thing... Every time you enter a new area, there are 3~5 new quests to do and they are all the same. Unlike Skyrim, there's no reason to explore areas UNLESS you have a quest. Since everything gives you XP (literally, everything does), you'll run into a problem where everything gets too easy too quickly. I highly recommend playing the game on hard, otherwise it will be too easy. You'll also encounter a problem where you discover an entirely new area that has more quests in it but... everyuthing in the area has a gray name because you were over leveled by the previous area.The big areas are worse with the mini-map and the camera. The Minimap has that problem Final Fantasy XIV had where the only areas you can run are drawn or emphasises. Since there are invisible walls around the edges, the big massive world turns into whatever is pictured on the minimap. The camera only makes this worse because you have to manually aim up to see how vast everything is. It auto-levels to a downward angle of the player whenever you move.Technically speaking, Reckoning is also a Fable clone for combat. You can hit stuff, shoot stuff. It works just fine. But as I have stated above, there's only one real viable option: The finese route. You can mix and choose, like I did for my original 30hours on Origin, but you will HAVE to use the finese armor and skills because they simply do so much output.If you can withstand, avoiding some quests so you can focus on the main quests, the game isn't that bad. Combat can be fun when it isn't insulting easy; and the MAIN story quests and the FACTION quests are worth the time. Just only pay $10~15. Be sure to get the DLC for the quests; but not those extra weapons because they will be replaced within your first two hours of play.			",313,29,2,16,5,0,6

												It's like a linear version of Elder Scrolls if you've ever played one of them. Fully voiced, lots of lore, decent story, quests occasionally have options to alter the outcome, graphics are crisp, animations are mostly clean, there's detail in level design, lootz, crafting (optional) and a ""double layered"" level up system (able to tech into multiple trees and choose one passive perk). In a nutshell it's a dungeon crawler in 3rd person instead of top-down.Perhaps my favorite part about Amalur aside from above is the feeling of not being tethered to the game in order to notice progression. I can play for just 15 minutes and actually accomplish something.On a minor negative note, Amalur does not give the full freedom other games allow. The player can not jump and the player can not decide to step off a cliff on whim; there are set locations to allow dropping into water or down a cliff-side. Fortunately these limitations do not or hinder gameplay.Combat is straight forward and fairly rewarding. Left click to continue swinging, instill a pause or hold the click to start a special attack. The player can also mix in magic or swap weapons on the fly to make some interesting combos and setups. Though combat may seem too basic the AI does its job in finding those holes in defenses and can manage to really take a chunk of health. While left clicking is easy, positioning amongst groups of enemies is where the player needs to maintain control even though the AI isn't the smartest.I would recommend Amalur to anybody who likes leveling up and combining classes. The game actually feels like a dungeon crawler but from a behind the shoulder perspective.I would also highly recommend downloading the YSA mod which balances the game to make Hard mode actually hard and Normal not such an cakewalk.Additional Thought: It would be nice if Amalur was coop multiplayer though it does a great job as a singleplayer game. If War in the North mixed with Amalur...			",51,6,1,11,1,0,11

												I wanted this game to be rly great after i saw all reviews, but for me it wasnt total blast in the end.You should buy it is still nice rpg, but I expected something more. The thing that kept me playing was definitely AWESOME Combat sytem. This is 9/10 combat, but camera wasnt that great sometimes but not a huge deal.I hate, that this game doesnt have FOV slider and i couldnt almost play it at original setting so i downloaded 3rd party FOV program (found it in community guides) which made my time with this game much more enjoyable.Also if you are fan of epic story and great storytelling you will be probably kinda dissapointing. Story isn´t awful, but nothing spectacular and storytelling in this game isn´t good enough to keep you invested in characters.All things considered this game is worth trying if you are fan of action combat and want GOOD RPG (dont expect best RPG ever).PS : sorry for typos			",56,13,2,7,6,1,4

												Great combat and interesting setting with fight against fate. I really enjoyed the graphical look even though i was disappointed that there wasn't that good looking robes for mage.  Though atleast mages got one of the best weapons in any game, dual  (FLAMING!) chakrams! unfortunately most side missions are forgottable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Even a few years after the release I still think that this game is among the best RPGs ever created for console and computer. The graphics plus characters are lovely and the world is as many-sided as it is dangerous. You can do a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of sidequests which sometimes makes you forget what you are supposed to do, but personally, I love that about my openworld RPGs. After 20 hours of playing this game (yet again since I started it when I came out but started over again here on steam) and completing all sidequests so far, I can say that this game is totally underrated and has a lot to offer.Personally I don't share the opinion that this was crappily adapted from the consoles. I've seen far worse adaptions over the years and it's really easy to get along with this one; of course, sometimes you might encounter situations in the menue where you definitely clicked on ""Load"" instead of ""Save"" but who the hell cares about that anyway. Go back and make sure you click the right one xD I haven't encountered any bugs or problems with the game so far; not now and not when I played it back when it was released for the computer.So anybody who likes RPGs and open-world and a ridiculously interesting story: You should really buy this!

												I picked this up during one of the Steam sales, but had passed on it a number of times prior because I had the impression that this was supposed to be a not so great game. I enjoyed it, and if you've played Skyrim to death and want something similar in a different setting, this should fit the bill. Lots of decent quests along with the usual grindy tasks as well.  However, the DLC is only so-so and does not come with a level cap increase, so only buy if it's really cheap and you just want to have more to do in the Amalur world. The combat is hack and slash style al a God of War and that ilk. Button mashy, but there are special moves and it's easy to pick up. This has more of a console feel to it than does Skyrim.

												I absolutely love this game. It's easily one of my favorite games of all time and I'm still to this day disapointed that the company went belly up and there will never be anything else in this game world.I like everything about this game but the part that really makes it stand above and beyond for me is the combat. There isn't any one specific thing about it, it just feels good. It's fast, smooth, and flows. No matter if you want to go heavy melee, fast melee, bow, spells, or some combination of them all, it not only works but looks and feels good while it's doing it.The world, the characters, the story, the combat, I love it all.

												Bargin from the sale, pumped only five hours into it so far. But i must say it plays very well. Warrior, Thief , or mage as your classes and they also do multi classing when you get higher in the levels , so you can build your own style with in the game. The story is easy to follow , with a strong back story that you can jump right into and feel apart of from the out set. Well done voice acting, on normal ive not died yet but the first play though i dont mind as you can increase that part in another play though.			",84,18,3,18,32,2,30

												One of the most enjoyable RPG's I have every played, whilst not as visually attractive as games such as Skyrim, The Witcher and Dragon age, it offers a colourful environment which is very pleasing and interesting to view. Kingdoms of Amalur does the mechanics so well with easy to use menus to filter through armour, weapons and other items. Combat is fantastic, it is simple yet there are so many options available to you, with so many different types of weapons. Any 2 weapons can be equipped at one time and mapped to a single button, however this doesn't mean you have to choose between one hulking big hammer as your primary and a piddly dagger as your secondary, you can choose whatever you wish; two handed great sword and a warhammer sure thing! No waiting until the end of the game to unlock cool armour as its readily available from the start, and you will always find yourself picking up new and interesting weapons and armour pieces which makes you feel like you are always progressing. You can change your characters build pretty much when you want for a small fee and aren't restricted to certain weapons for a certain class. Everyhting is down to you and you can make the came play how you want. In addition the game is massive with so many places to explore and quests to complete, they are very samey however they never feel repetative due to the how well the rest of the game plays. Overall 9/10 my only real problem is the fact you can't instantly jump between your map and the quest log. Menus load fast and are super responsive and saving the game can be done in seconds and your back playing (useful when your saving every 5 minutes like me)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is what I wished Fable II and III wereA huge world filled with quests and monsters kill. The game really does appeal to almost every sense of a great fantasy game: combat, exploration, interaction, etc. The camera could be a bit tricky as it did tend to fling around easily, but later in my playing I found that to be beneficial and detrimental to me in combat as pushing a key in the direction you want to attack and not the way the camera faced could be confusing at times, but I adapted. The greatsword is by far the most fun weapon to play with in my opinion. I love games where they truly allow a greatsword to shine- where, when the blade hits something, it hits something. Striking multiple enemies and moving between them all in between swings feels extremely satisfying and really does give you a feel for that fanstical combat with monsters. The animations for many of the weapons are strong indeed, the only weapon I truly disliked were the hammers. Slow, clunky and short range. Staves, chakrams, and faeblades all look and feel very cool to use. Attacking and switching between weapons cancelled combo's and would allow you to be much more variable in combat.The only things that I felt lacked were indepth, meaningful conversation with people, romance and how empty and underused many towns were. Now, no romance isn't necessarally a bad thing, but for rpg's it should be a given- everyone likes it and if you don't, well, you're wrong. Might is right. ",193,24,1,20,6,0,15

												What great fun. Why did no one play this game? It's huge, beautiful, and has rewarding combat system. If you have been gaming for a long time it's best to start this on hard mode and forgo crafting armor/weapons. It keeps the game feelings more balanced and challenging through lvl 35. Story has been great.  You have your common tropes as with all fantasy, but there are many unexpected turns and vast amounts of lore.  It balances in the favor of the good storytelling.You should get this game.			",49,26,0,14,2,2,9

												A review for this game may be pointless now. But I feel I need to praise this game for the immense enjoyment I got out of it since purchase. I will say three very positive things about this game.1 Combat balance: While it is true this game is super easy past level 20 or so, the ""balance"" I am talking about here is the balance between warrior/mage/rogue play styles. Unlike many other fantasy type games I've played, where your mage character usually gets much less choice in equipment compared to warrior/rogue types, here in this game, mages have the equal amount of variety in both weapon and armor selection, and some of the mage weapons are the most interesting ones I have ever played in any game. Reversely, in many other fantasy games, while warrior and rogue characters got more choices in equipment, they got shafted in spells they can use, this is again not true for this game. The rogue and warrior have a lot of interesting abilities they can cast around just like mages. This balanced playing style makes all three schools and any combination of the three feel refreshed and extremely fun for the majority of the game. And if you are like me who feel mages should have as much choice in equipment as other characters you are certainly going to love this game.2 Art style: Kingdoms of Amalur is probably the most gorgeous game I have seen for a very long time. While many mordern games may have better ""graphics"", they don't necessarily look any prettier. I am in the camp that firmly believes a good art design and style is more important than graphics and constantly find games from 1990s look better than games released in the past 10 years. And while the very particular bright and colorful art style of this game may not be for everyone, it is definitely the preferred style for me. And the game maps is carefully designed so you end up in many majestic positions in game to appreciate the view. Each major city in the game is grand and elegantly beautiful, each region has its own unique charm while all look amazingly appeasing all the time. In summary I think the art style is perfect in this game, if you love it at first sight you will love it for the remainder of the game.3 Sound track: While not many of the soundtracks stand out on their own, the magic thing here is that each of them goes along perfectly with the scenary. Good soundtrack in video games enhances the atmosphere and by that standard each music piece in this game is considered superb. Whether if it is charm, grandeur, danger or mystery the music in this game brings the mood out perfectly.To sum up, this is one of the most fun and beautiful game I have played in a long time. I hope whoever read this review can enjoy it as much as I do with this piece of epic gem.			",29,8,0,9,3,0,2

												A main storyline playthrough of the game itself is only 26 or so hours. Why the ♥♥♥♥ would I say ONLY? The game has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (200+ hours) of content in sidequests and other content. 200 HOURS!! That's right, crazy. So you're sold on the amount of content, right? But what of the QUALITY. Well, I can confirm each quest, especially a ton of the side quests, has an interesting and unique story that fits into the huge ammount content in this lore filled world. Many of the side quests I've seen allow for alternate rewards and task changing interaction through fully voice-acted dialogue based around your pursuasion (charisma in other games) skill. (Making tue skill actually useful, unlike some games.) The character destiny cards systems encourages awesome hyhbrids of different combat styles and abilities from the three main branches where you can invest ability points. These cards are unlocked based on what trees you invest your AP to add bonus stats and even complete changes to your abilities to make yourself into the exact blend of abilities and strengths you desire.The combat itself introduces a number of skill based fighting mechanics that never seem to lose their weighty and epic feel. This is only added to in the fact that you can make any number of crazy class combinations to tailor your combat experience. Not to mention the weapon and gear options that are also complimented by the epic skills system.The complexity and depth added in the alchemy, blacksmithing, detect hidden, dispelling, lockpicking, mercantile, pursuasion, sagecraft, and stealth skills furthurs the great sense of benefit you get from investing in one skill each level. Each skill builds to greater perks as you invest furthur along in one particular skill, but the gut wrenching decisions you face in deciding where to invest next are what makes you realize the importance of each skill, and the role they serve.The progression of the game overall is at pretty much whatever pace you play at. If you want to rush to train for that next ability, do it. You will be fine, although you might want to bring some extra potions. If instead you want to do some side quests and join guilds for added benefits and rewards, do it. In fact, you can maintain a balance of both. The only qualm (not even that) I have is that if you progress to a furthur area and return to do some quests, they can in some cases seem too easy after becoming more powerful. Which, I don't see it really as a game flaw, because it is just the nature of the RPG genre. For example: after having defeated a dragon and then returning to kill some slimes of any typical rpg would be a walk in the park.I've been through just the tip of the iceberg, and there lies a journey of trials and triumph awaiting you. So,please buy this game, not for me, but yourself. You'll be glad you did.			",554,74,3,67,46,1,77

												Essentially, this game is an EA verison of Elder Scrolls and just as incredible. I've only just begun playing this  game and I'm already taken in by it. From it's immersible gameplay to it's unrivaled scenery, the game is perfect, to say nothing of the epic weaponry. There are four races to choose from with each having it's own unique attributes and the choice of a deity to allign onself with or not at all. There are perks to choosing a deity. Also, like in the Elder Scrolls franchise, you may design your own character down to the facial tattoo, though the designs are less numerous than those in Elder Scrolls, meaning you can't adjust the eye width or scowl lines or anything of that nature. You can, however, choose your own destiny as either a Rogue, an Acolyte, or a Brawler. Overall, the game is an unbeatable 10/10 with it's amount of quests and side-quests. I'm only at Level 3 and I've already found three unbelieveable suits of armour, shields, and weapons. This game is well worth it's cost.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Definitely one of the best ARPGs that came out recently.The combat system is really well done. Not only the control feels smooth, you are also given so much freedom to find your own play style. You can equip any two weapons and four spells at a time, and you can mix them however you want in combat. Not to mention the weapon crafting system and the gem crafting/socketing system that further enchance the customzation. Either you want to be Gandalf or Geralt of Rivia, it's all up to you. There are also classes, or Destinies, for you to choose and change at any time.One thing I don't like is the dodging. It's hard to find the right timing to dodge an incoming attack, at least for me. I think it is caused by the slight delay before your character makes a dodge, or I just suck at dodging. Hey, guess what, I can also block with my shield and it doesn't take a weapon slot.The blend of sword and magic and the stylish art style remind me of the Fable series. As far as combat goes, KOA:R definitely does it better than the Fable series. However I don't find KOA:R's story is intriguing enough for me. ""Wow your fate is blank"" ""You'll save the world"" blah blah blah. I still enjoy the gameplay, at least.One last thing, you can hide your helmet!! 10/10			",126,61,3,43,29,0,16

												Kingdoms of Amalur is a ""should buy"" for anyone into fantasy CRPGs. Why not a must buy? It is a game and apparently a game franchise with no future. It plays far better with a controller than it does with a mouse and keyboard. What about the good stuff? If you don't like crafting, you need not engage in it; but, if you are into crafting, there are opportunities to build some crazy good gear. Potions are kind of hit and miss, but you won't regret being able to make health regeneration and healing potions. Overall, crafted gear is not as critical as it can be Skyrim; and potions are definitely more useful. I really liked the combat system with its combos and different types of attacks working better/worse for different foes. There are opportunities to crank up the difficulty and win by thinking your way to victory. Alternately, you can reduce difficulty and just button mash your way through . . . should you fear the joystick and the nuances to combat. Each of the three major types of character archetypes yields a different playing experience. The story and RP aspects of the game? Given the pedigree of those involved, this was actually little disappointing. The story arc isn't bad, but it is not as rewarding as, say, Dragon Age:  Origins or the first installment of Mass Effect.  The DLC is actually pretty good if you can forgive the grindiness of Naros and the silly in Dead Kel (some will find the silly endearing . . . others not so much). Some of the faction quest lines are actually good to very good; but the relationships you build with the factions comes to crashing end when the faction quests end. At the very least, this is a missed opportunity.I have no regrets buying this game when it was on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Underdog detected :)PROS- Truly HUGE world.- An amazing amount of quests, a lot to do- Three classes with that play very differently because of their skills- High polish and optimisationCONS - Weird to say but the game is so huge that sometimes it can be discouraging :) But this is not really a con, mostly we have been playing short games for so long that we lost the attention span required to play a game for weeks.- Some of the lore can be boring sometimes. I find the fae to be a boring race for exemple, bunch of broken record playing the same songs again and again. But it fits the story and the world setting, i just wish there were more diversity in the culture of the world.REVIEWThis is a huge game and deserves a long review, but lacking the time suffice to say that it is an excelent RPG, and fairly unique in the way it tastes like an MMO because of its scale.I am not sure why this title didn't do better, I can't recall but i think at the time it came out there were 3-4 big titles coming out also and they completely overshadowed this game. I guess most people didn't have the budget or the gaming time for another 60$ title. I only grabbed this recently because it went on sale, and certeinly don't regret it. I got about 90 hours out of it already after finishing it (not a full clear mind you, a lot of quests and some exploration still left over), and I still have the DLCs set aside.Some advice : If you get slightly bored in your play, respecialize as another class. I went through all the 3 classes in my single playthrough, and it helped keep things fresh. The game certeinly doesn't warrant a playthrough with each class as it would be too repetitive, so might as well experience all classes on the same go.			",360,75,5,72,42,2,66

												Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is this astounding combination of open world RPG along with the hack & slash style, yet it also encompasses this unique theme which I have never experienced in any video game: Fate. The story makes you realize how people live their lives knowing their end, their fate, their imminent demise or wonderous growth. The storyline itself is immpecable and is one of the best I have ever played through. You can play your character the way you want, you can choose your own destiny and you have absolute control over other people's destinies, as it is revealed to you. Gives you the feeling of a demi-god, so to say !As far as any shortcomings go, there are only a couple. Owing to the fact that it's an open world game, so the amount of resources and items present are uncountable, so if there was a steady offline guide, telling you about each of said items, that would have been fantastic. Some might say that would spoil the experience of figuring out things, but that's my opinion. The other shortcoming is that the amount of running around that you have to do initially, can really tire someone in real life(Don't worry, your character won't be tired though!) and it becomes quite the task running around from one place to another. That said, the running around gives you an ample opportunity to explore Amalur and deviate from quests, thus making the experience very non-linear. Since there are, in fact, as I quote SSoHPKC, ""a butt-ton of quests"", you will never be short of them and will always have something or the other to do as you progress through the game.In conclusion, you have to play this game for the experience and the gameplay that you honestly, will not find anywhere else.  I regret not playing it when it came out, but you should buy it while it's still on sale ! It is definitely worth the small amount.			",59,7,1,9,1,1,3

												Good points:Very good combat system - you can perform many different moves and unlock much more. It's not just spamming LMB. Combat is very satisfying.Interesting leveling up system.OK controlls with mouse and keyboard (however i would still use a controller).Bad points:Mediocre graphics.Uninteresting dialogues.Almost identical dungeons.Lots of invisible walls.World mostly consists of narrow corridors.Boring quests.Uninteresting loot.Confusing inventory.Mediocre game, but I would still recommend it for it's fine combat system, however without it, game doesn't have much to offer. Not recommended for a full price, wait for a discount.			",154,10,5,14,1,0,3

												Very good RPG. Suffers from the MMO syndrome, lots of quests not related to the plot. Open world-ish, with significant amount of things to do, but quite repetitive if you are not used to MMO's. Three main classes, that can combine to form variants (And these variants are supported by the game, wich is nice), lots of perks, crafting, weapons with very cool and unique abilities and skins.Story is terribly cliche, but all in all it's very fun to play.Totally recommand for anybody that is a minimum used to the MMO system.

												I tried this game a bit and I can't say it's a bad angle although at times the camera annoyed me.What I will say about this game is this.  This game apperently came out around the same time as Skyrim and because Elder Scrolls always gets so much hype, people forgot about it I guess.Here's the thing though.  This is not a game you can compare to skyrim.  This is not a true RPG like Skyrim.  This is far more like Fable.Yes, I would definetly compare what I've played of this game heavily to Fable.  It's far more of an adventure style RPG like Fable and if you enjoyed Fable even a little bit but like me always wanted more.  Then I think this game is a good choice.I'm a bit of a loot snob and I prefer elder scrolls series for a few things, total customization, wide world map (this game has walls, lots of guiding walls like Fable does and like Elder Scrolls does not) and HEY, if that guy i just killed was carrying two sword a crossbow and chainmail armor, I want all of that, whatever he was saving for lunch, and the gold in his pocket.Because I am a looter.  Fable doesn't give you that much loot.  This game doesn't give you that much loot.(but hey, the gear is pretty wicked.)TL:DR, This game compares far more to fable then it does to elderscrolls. you like fable style games? buy this.

Posted: October 9, 2014
												A review for this game may be pointless now. But I feel I need to praise this game for the immense enjoyment I got out of it since purchase. I will say three very positive things about this game.1 Combat balance: While it is true this game is super easy past level 20 or so, the ""balance"" I am talking about here is the balance between warrior/mage/rogue play styles. Unlike many other fantasy type games I've played, where your mage character usually gets much less choice in equipment compared to warrior/rogue types, here in this game, mages have the equal amount of variety in both weapon and armor selection, and some of the mage weapons are the most interesting ones I have ever played in any game. Reversely, in many other fantasy games, while warrior and rogue characters got more choices in equipment, they got shafted in spells they can use, this is again not true for this game. The rogue and warrior have a lot of interesting abilities they can cast around just like mages. This balanced playing style makes all three schools and any combination of the three feel refreshed and extremely fun for the majority of the game. And if you are like me who feel mages should have as much choice in equipment as other characters you are certainly going to love this game.2 Art style: Kingdoms of Amalur is probably the most gorgeous game I have seen for a very long time. While many mordern games may have better ""graphics"", they don't necessarily look any prettier. I am in the camp that firmly believes a good art design and style is more important than graphics and constantly find games from 1990s look better than games released in the past 10 years. And while the very particular bright and colorful art style of this game may not be for everyone, it is definitely the preferred style for me. And the game maps is carefully designed so you end up in many majestic positions in game to appreciate the view. Each major city in the game is grand and elegantly beautiful, each region has its own unique charm while all look amazingly appeasing all the time. In summary I think the art style is perfect in this game, if you love it at first sight you will love it for the remainder of the game.3 Sound track: While not many of the soundtracks stand out on their own, the magic thing here is that each of them goes along perfectly with the scenary. Good soundtrack in video games enhances the atmosphere and by that standard each music piece in this game is considered superb. Whether if it is charm, grandeur, danger or mystery the music in this game brings the mood out perfectly.To sum up, this is one of the most fun and beautiful game I have played in a long time. I hope whoever read this review can enjoy it as much as I do with this piece of epic gem.			",29,8,0,9,3,0,2

												Game Name: Kingdoms of Amalur: ReckoningDeveloper: 38 Studios / Big Huge GamesGenre: Role Playing / RPG History: I first played Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning on the xbox 360 2 years ago about 6 months after it's debute. I loved it! I saw it on sale on here and picked it up. I had a blast playing though it a second time.Story: You are the ""Fateless One"" you start the game off as a dead body. You are dumped down onto a pile of bodies in what seems to be an incinerator room. Shortly after you wake up and find the place you are at under attack. As you progress though the story you find out how you came to be, and that you have no ""fate"" and are able to change the fates of those around you. This leads you on a quest to stop the evil  Tuatha Deohn, their King Gadflow and  their God  Tirnoch all of whom want you dead a second time.Game play: This is where is game shines and also falls short. You can chose from any combination of three classes Warrior, Rogue, or Mage. You have many skills and a very well done progession tree. You can also redo your toon anytime you want at a fatewaver for a price. This is very well done to me it allows us the players never to be tired down to one class. If you want to be a mage and use a greatsword as your main weapon do it!! You also have a unique power to fateshift enemies. This grats an experience bonus and each enemy has a different fateshift death all of them are really cool. The monsters in the games quests level with you but, on the open world map they have set levels. This ensures that you can't get too far ahead as enemies will start to one shot you before too long. As for the games difficulty it's a very easy game. They made it way to easy to make your toon unkillable ( Unlike in skyrim where there is an armor cap making heary armor useless accpet for looks as you can never get past 80% damage reduction ) In this game there is no cap at all on armor or resistance. I had made my toon almost unkillable by about 20 hours into the game. That's where is falls short the first time. You should never have a ""no cap on armor or resistance"" always cap them at least 80%. This also made to me all the sets of armor pretty useless. None of them could come close to what I could make just by socketing a few gems into dropped armors. This also sets the game up for you to have a lot of fun making your perfect unkillable toon though. By the end of the game when you have access to flawless blacksmithing you can in fact make a toon that cannot be killed. I had a great time making my unkillable mage with -100% mana costs. I had a blast just slinging spells left and right completely obliterating all that opposed my demigod powers!Where is game really falls short is making the people and stories interesting. After the first few hours of gameplay I found myself skipping all the dialogue and just following the yellow circles on the map. The people are boring and the way they talk in that monotone voice set put me to sleep. Only a few of the main assist charactors have thier own unique models it. Everyone else in the entire game pretty much looks the same. I found this to be very boring. They could have used more soundbites as well... I hated running though adessa every single gnome says ""What!!"" as you walk past and all the humans say ""yes, aye"" just one trip made me mute the sound till I left the city. If they had made the toons more unique and added more soundbites it would have been so much better.This game is still soild in the gameplay field 7/10 Graphics: The graphics are nothing special they seem to be really basic to me. They are cartoonish and fun. They don't try to make you go ohhhh wow..... they just do their job. That's really the best way I can describe them again just solid 6/10Audio: This game is fully voiced although sometimes you mite find yourself muting the volume. The tones are so boring no emotion, everyone is like a robot. The soundtrack is decient The battle themes and town themes fit where you are and what you have doing. It's all really average. 6/10Pro’s/Con’s: ProsWonderful combat systemVery well done skill treesYou can fateshift enemies killing them in amazing ways.many armors and weapons to chose fromyou can make your own armor and weapons (to Godly Standards if you want)many, many quests!!there are some funny moments with glitchs in the game, like people walking though or getting stuck in walls that'll make you laugh.Cons I can sum up the only real con with this game. I will not remeber anything about it other than combat after awhile. Everything not related to combat was boring!! Compare this to Skyrim where I can tell you the whole story and recall most of the peoples names even after having not played it for so long. With this game that I beat just latenight I cannot recall the names of any of the people accpet Gadflow, Tirnoch, Agarth and Alyn Shir. Everyone else I have forgot as it just didn't hold my interest at all. Overall:  This is a wonderful game to play just to pass the time. If you are looking for a game with a Story and Characters you can really sink your teeth into to me it's not this game. If you are looking for a game where you can kill all that oppose you or protect all the weak with your godlike powers this is perfect. To really sum it up this game has amazing combat and that's really it, everything else is just average. I give this game a 7/10 I had a wonderful time killing each and every enemy with my fateshifting powers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great Fun! The characters are pretty wooden, although they try to add some humor, that said the most humor I have is smashing down anyone, yes you can smash down almost every character. This can detriment the game a little, I smashed some people in a market and missed the chance at an inventory, but at the same time I smashed some blind followers on an island and got good armor.I found one breaking bug on the Dead Kel DLC, didn't bother me too much cause the game is so fun, also take it of full screen mode but keep the native resolution to reduce the frame rate issues, it doesn't actually take it out of full screen  but solves issues. What I like is that it doesn't try to be realistic or serious, like ahmm, oh no there's a big dragon. You've got dialogue choices where you can belittle characters for taking themselves too seriously, more fun. I have a sword that's bigger than me and ancient frisbies.As I said it's fun and funny, the beasts look incredible and they're diverse, the combat makes you feel like a megalith, you can become very overpowered very quickly, but you can challenge yourself by resetting your class and reassigning points or mixing your class up.I really enjoy this game, it's fantasy, colorful, full of loot and funny. It constantly reminds you, that you are in a fantasy world and absolutely rips into it if you want.I disagree it's anything like an MMORPG, it laughs at itself, it laughs at RPG's and then say's cause it's fun and that's the way it's meant to be. If you're looking for a game that's bright, energetic, fun and funny, doesn't take itself to seriously, I find that it is a bit like the Borderlands of the fantasy realm with more dialogue choice and I love borderlands.

												If you're a fan of Fable: The Lost Chapters, then you'll like this game. While it's not exactly the same feel, it's still extremely enjoyable. I absolutely loved the first Fable when it came out and have been searching for a game just as fun, and KOA: Reckoning definitely delivers. Also the music is composed by Grant Kirkhope, the composer behind: Banjo Kazooie 1 and 2Donkey Kong Country 2Goldeneye 007Perfect DarkGrabbed by the GhouliesAnd several other titles...He made (and still makes) some fantastic music in my opinion, and he definitely delivered for this game. So if you're one of those people (like me) who love when a game has a great score, you won't be disappointed here.			",172,17,7,21,16,0,6

												Great game, i have this game in my library pretty much since it was released and never got to try it out, but a few weeks ago i found a documentary about the downfall of 38 studios and found that this game was some kind of test for much bigger tittle that never come to see the light of day (one thing is certain, if it was better that this one, its a shame that never got completed).Im doing this review now bc the game is on sale right now, im at 104 hour in game and didnt completed the game yet (but i usually do every side quest, look every rock and that kind of stuff but didnt touch in any of the dlc story yet, so my money is already worth while).This game is kind of the Fable Lost Chapter with few diferent combat mechanics, many side quests to do, tasks, some story choices that turn things out for good vs evil, and a very well scattered Lore behind all life in Amalur, and believe me, so much Lore, backstory, insane amount of dialogs that you could build another story just was much was rich was this one.The combat is satisfying but there are a few things to keep in mind and avoid to ruin the experience, never enter dungeons before any task told you to, to keep enemy at your level and avoid overpowered character early in game, you cant really do nothing outside of them bc after while, doesnt matter where, enemys are much lower level that you, but dungeons, always bring enemys to your current level.Tasks are a good way to get money or materials since they never end and you can always get the reward for completing them since the moment you accept them.There are so much information to be found in the world, that if you like this kind of background story like me, you have so many hours to get entertainement out of it, and even that the combat sometimes get a bit repetitive, it doesnt really detach you from trying to know more about everything.

												Kingdoms of Amalur can be too easy, its camera is horrible with a controller and the controls are worse with a keyboard, its quests have a ""quantity over quality"" feel to them, it has the kind of game progression that would be best suited for an MMO, some of the most interesting parts of its world are often told bland and confusingly instead of shown and its story commits a giant sin by being about choice and freedom while offering little of either. Also, its level cap is quite low.Why am I recommending this game, then? Did my finger slip, making me click ""yes"" by accident?Well, this is one of those games where no matter how many annoying or bad points I see, in the end I find myself enjoying it immenselly. It has all those bad things I mentioned, sure, but the timing-focused hacky\slashy\dodgy combat is super enjoyable, the region based world is both easy on the eyes and enourmous without feeling empty, and the characters that inhabit it are mostly interesting even if the game's way of presenting them isn't.Yeah, it's still a hell of a lot of negatives coupled with a few positives, but... well, I still really enjoy it. I think this might be the kind of game that, like Skyrim\Fallout 3 or any other of Bethesda's recent titles (mods aside), is worth way more than the sum of its parts.			",504,168,9,74,37,5,50

												Kingdoms of Amalur is your typical fantasy open-world RPG. Its fantastic combat system has you pulling badass moves right from the start, rewards player use of variety and offers a well thought out skill progression. The level scaling unfortunately makes the game too easy later on. The environments are lush and visually spectacular with a huge amount of variety. Despite this, its populace are cookie-cutter NPCs and you’ll fatigue from the hundreds of quests constantly being thrown in your face. The resulting little characterisation makes it hard to get invested into this game. Combat and exploration are its saving factors.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A very good game that somehow slipped past me before. If you like Singleplayer RPG's with questing, leveling, crafting and learn new abilities every new level, but also like some action as well then this is a game to look into. When fighting mobs you need to learn how to dodge fast, or use your skills to outsmart them. Also your healthbar doesn't go up by itself when cowering away in a corner for a few seconds, so you need to use potions or level up or even visit a Healer in town to heal you and the healer can get also rid off curses that you have on you.There are loads of quests to do, and quests can even have a different outcome sometimes on if one of the smaller stories end well yes or no. You can follow the path of a warrior, rogue, mage or anything in between while you level. Loot, buy, steal or craft your new gear yourself, brew potions. You get loads of playtime for the price of this game.The story is very well done and the graphics are good as well, and the animations of the monsters are great, and they have some very cool moves they use against you. Only downsides I noticed in graphics was that when in cutscenes/talking to NPC's the camera is zoomed in and weapons on your back may be in front of the face of the person your talking to and the weapons aren't too detailed up close.One last notice is that this game is best played with a XBox360 Controller. Mouse and keyboard works as well right away, but I  used my controller after a few minutes because the game seems to be made for it.			",553,108,24,83,37,7,67

												A really enjoyable ARPG with open-world feeling, crafting, and console-like combat. It would be easy for this game to fall into the trap of not doing anything well, but it's a lot of fun. There's some great voice acting with a pretty good story for immersion, satisfying combat and a decent amount of challenge. A ton of quests to do means you'll set off in one direction and get entwined in a town's story when you were intending to do something else, and that's a good thing. This is also the case with ""shinies"" on the ground - alchemical ingredients and loot chests. My path through the game makes me look like a drunken bumblebee.I highly recommend using a controller for this game - trying to use a keyboard gave me an epic frowny-face until I looked up whether it had controller support. It's much more intuitive that way, though you'll still need to glance at the controls listing from time to time when starting out.I received a bunch of OP-feeling gear when starting out, I think due to the complete DLC pack, but I happily received some upgrades fairly early on. Leveling occurs at a decent pace - enough to keep you feeling like you're getting somewhere, but not so fast you don't have time to stop and smell the roses.I almost feel guilty having gotten this game at 75% off during the Steam Summer Sale. This is a rare game that feels worth the retail price (especially since it was only $20 to begin with).			",152,59,1,81,32,0,57

												This is a great game, Reminds me almost exactly of Fable 3 (but better). It has quirky characters, a fun story, and lots of side quests. And the looting is maybe one of my favorite parts so far. The combat is amazing and intricate, every battle feels intense and theres plenty of room for different stratigies. A must buy for RPG fans.

												Kingdoms of Amalur can be too easy, its camera is horrible with a controller and the controls are worse with a keyboard, its quests have a ""quantity over quality"" feel to them, it has the kind of game progression that would be best suited for an MMO, some of the most interesting parts of its world are often told bland and confusingly instead of shown and its story commits a giant sin by being about choice and freedom while offering little of either. Also, its level cap is quite low.Why am I recommending this game, then? Did my finger slip, making me click ""yes"" by accident?Well, this is one of those games where no matter how many annoying or bad points I see, in the end I find myself enjoying it immenselly. It has all those bad things I mentioned, sure, but the timing-focused hacky\slashy\dodgy combat is super enjoyable, the region based world is both easy on the eyes and enourmous without feeling empty, and the characters that inhabit it are mostly interesting even if the game's way of presenting them isn't.Yeah, it's still a hell of a lot of negatives coupled with a few positives, but... well, I still really enjoy it. I think this might be the kind of game that, like Skyrim\Fallout 3 or any other of Bethesda's recent titles (mods aside), is worth way more than the sum of its parts.			",504,168,9,74,37,5,50

												Okay, as of now I am 16.8 hours into that game and my impression up to now is that this is definitely a hidden gem! With almost all of the games coming out nowadays that focus on realistic graphics, I was a bit sceptical when I saw this. The trailer looked okay as well but it didn't look quite that impressive either.And oh boy, I was wrong to doubt this game! The graphics turned out to be one of the pleasing aspects of this game, making it feel quite unique. It has a comic look to it and the landscapes are very colorful but that doesn't stop the stories of the questline from being dark and even gruesome at times. It's just the artstyle of this fantasy world and I love it!The combat takes some getting used to at first but ends up being extremely fun. I also did not expect much of the story either but until now the quests seem fun, interesting and there are many choices to be made! Great voice-acting! I'm still getting into the lore but from what I've seen/heard/read it seems very good as well.I haven't encountered any glitches yet and I hope it stays this way. I am indeed considering buying the dlc's.To anyone pondering on whether to buy this or not: I can only say I definitely recommend this game for anyone that loves a good fantasy rpg, and if you happen to catch this on sale it's a must have! (remember I am only 16 hours into the game but you'll spend more money and less time in a pub for the same amount of fun. Unless...)The trailers do not do this game justice!			",51,2,1,13,6,0,1

												I would HIGHLY recommend this criminally underrated game. I haven't played as much as I would have liked on the PC version, but I played this game to death on the 360. I'm hard-pressed to think of any major complaints about Amalur. It's got a big world to explore, tons of quests and factions to join, a great crafting system, fantastic combat, and a superb character progression/skill system. I've got to go into detail about the skill system because it's one of the best I've ever used in an RPG. Amalur's skill/progression system lets you seamlessly blend together aspects of different builds effectively. All talents are broken down into Might (warrior), Finesse (rogue), and Sorcery (mage), and you can focus on one, mix the two, or even build into all three. If you focus on one, you'll be able to reach the higher-tier abilities faster. Whereas if you divide your build you'll have more variety and options in combat, but it will take longer to reach those endgame skills. You can mix as many or as few skills as you'd like; there are no wrong choices. Not only that, but as you build through the trees you get ""Destinies"" that you can change at any time. If you focus on Might abilities, you'll get Destinies that boost your Might abilities. If you mix together, say, Finesse and Sorcery, you'll unlock Destinies that compliment both of those styles. Each combination of skills has a corresponding Destiny branch, and each branch has its own unique feel that subtly changes your passive buffs/abilities. And on top of it all, if at any time you'd like to respec your character and start from scratch, you can do that for a small in-game fee (albeit one that grows slightly more expensive each time you do it, with the first one being free).In addition to your main talents/abilities, you get specific skills (think things like crafting, lockpicking, persuasion, etc.) that further define your character.The combat is also some of, if not the very best combat I've played in an RPG. Each class archetype (might, sorcery, and finesse) has three different weapon types to spec into. Each weapon type really does feel completely distinct from one another, having their own unique combos, timing, feel, and weight. A warhammer may seem similar to a greatsword on the surface, but when you actually have them in your hands, they feel quite different. You can have any two weapons equipped at the same time, and switching between them is as simple as pressing one of the two attack buttons. Primary weapons go on one, and secondary on the other. You can be mid-combo with a greatsword, and press the secondary attack button to immediately switch and attack with a bow.This game is filled to the brim with content. Places to see, people to meet, dungeons to explore, and loot to plunder. Great combat, great RPG mechanics, and a ton of variety and options.I truly feel like this is one of the most underrated games of its time and I would encourage anybody who is a fan of RPGs to give this game a shot.

												A very good game that somehow slipped past me before. If you like Singleplayer RPG's with questing, leveling, crafting and learn new abilities every new level, but also like some action as well then this is a game to look into. When fighting mobs you need to learn how to dodge fast, or use your skills to outsmart them. Also your healthbar doesn't go up by itself when cowering away in a corner for a few seconds, so you need to use potions or level up or even visit a Healer in town to heal you and the healer can get also rid off curses that you have on you.There are loads of quests to do, and quests can even have a different outcome sometimes on if one of the smaller stories end well yes or no. You can follow the path of a warrior, rogue, mage or anything in between while you level. Loot, buy, steal or craft your new gear yourself, brew potions. You get loads of playtime for the price of this game.The story is very well done and the graphics are good as well, and the animations of the monsters are great, and they have some very cool moves they use against you. Only downsides I noticed in graphics was that when in cutscenes/talking to NPC's the camera is zoomed in and weapons on your back may be in front of the face of the person your talking to and the weapons aren't too detailed up close.One last notice is that this game is best played with a XBox360 Controller. Mouse and keyboard works as well right away, but I  used my controller after a few minutes because the game seems to be made for it.			",553,108,24,83,37,7,67

												I had heard a lot of crap about this game before I played it, and only bought it because it was 7 bucks with all the DLC included and because I had tried a demo of the game on the 360 a while back and it seemed decent enough. That 7 bucks brought me roughly 77 or so hours of content. I consider this to be a pretty decent deal. The main complaint I hear is that the game is repetetive - which RPG isn't? I also hear it compared to MMORPG games a bit, but the quests do actually have you going to places and doing various tasks rather than your traditional MMO routine of ""kill 5 rats."" It does have the Dragon Age 2 issue of all of the dungeons looking roughly the same, but that was the only real negative I could think of while playing through the game. The story is interesting enough, the combat while a bit easy at times is variable depending on how you spec your character (one of three styles: warrior, thief, mage ..essentially). You can also mix them up a bit.If you can find the game for as cheap as I did I say grab it. For 60 bucks? I don't think I'd have been♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥I spent the money and got this in return, but I'm not sure I'd buy this over something like Skyrim for the same amount.			",233,79,0,53,10,2,14

												Decent story - relatively satisfying conclusion - and enjoyable gameplay with gorgeous scenery throughout. Immense customization is available and the combat is fast paced, intuitive, and rewarding. It is easy to change your ""fate"" and try a different play style at any point in the game - I switched back and forth from magic and finesse more times than I can count - and the different unlockable options for combat are really enjoyable. More than just a hack-and-slash, this game encourages you to consider particular approaches for particular enemies based on their weapon type and behavior. At the upper levels you have four or five different moves for any given weapon, all executed through a simple interface - click, pause click, click while dodging, click while blocking, click after parrying. Combined with a wide variety of spells and special abilities, you have numerous options for engaging with a particular enemy, or multiple enemies at once.It was hard to really get a feel for my character, though, since it is clear that in order to complete quests and gain experience, there is a very particular sort of person your character is supposed to be. More options for how to complete certain quests would have been nice. Overall though, it was a great experience and my first playthrough lasted 78 hours. And I'm thinking about playing through it again because I know I missed so much and never even gave the ""might"" skill tree a chance! 8/10 would recommend.			",8,1,0,2,6,0,1

This is what I wished Fable II and III wereA huge world filled with quests and monsters kill. The game really does appeal to almost every sense of a great fantasy game: combat, exploration, interaction, etc. The camera could be a bit tricky as it did tend to fling around easily, but later in my playing I found that to be beneficial and detrimental to me in combat as pushing a key in the direction you want to attack and not the way the camera faced could be confusing at times, but I adapted. The greatsword is by far the most fun weapon to play with in my opinion. I love games where they truly allow a greatsword to shine- where, when the blade hits something, it hits something. Striking multiple enemies and moving between them all in between swings feels extremely satisfying and really does give you a feel for that fanstical combat with monsters. The animations for many of the weapons are strong indeed, the only weapon I truly disliked were the hammers. Slow, clunky and short range. Staves, chakrams, and faeblades all look and feel very cool to use. Attacking and switching between weapons cancelled combo's and would allow you to be much more variable in combat.The only things that I felt lacked were indepth, meaningful conversation with people, romance and how empty and underused many towns were. Now, no romance isn't necessarally a bad thing, but for rpg's it should be a given- everyone likes it and if you don't, well, you're wrong. Might is right. ",193,24,1,20,6,0,15

												Just shy of 170 hours and I have a few small side quests for one of DLC's outstanding. Huge game! I wanted to see it all and it managed to keep me interested for the entire time. Worth playing if you like large RPG's. It can feel slightly repetitive but it still has a satisfying combat system with lots of juicy animations. I picked this up in a sale and I'm glad I got the chance to play it.			",90,15,2,11,10,2,7

												If you're a fan of Fable: The Lost Chapters, then you'll like this game. While it's not exactly the same feel, it's still extremely enjoyable. I absolutely loved the first Fable when it came out and have been searching for a game just as fun, and KOA: Reckoning definitely delivers. Also the music is composed by Grant Kirkhope, the composer behind: Banjo Kazooie 1 and 2Donkey Kong Country 2Goldeneye 007Perfect DarkGrabbed by the GhouliesAnd several other titles...He made (and still makes) some fantastic music in my opinion, and he definitely delivered for this game. So if you're one of those people (like me) who love when a game has a great score, you won't be disappointed here.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I absolutely love this game. It's easily one of my favorite games of all time and I'm still to this day disapointed that the company went belly up and there will never be anything else in this game world.I like everything about this game but the part that really makes it stand above and beyond for me is the combat. There isn't any one specific thing about it, it just feels good. It's fast, smooth, and flows. No matter if you want to go heavy melee, fast melee, bow, spells, or some combination of them all, it not only works but looks and feels good while it's doing it.The world, the characters, the story, the combat, I love it all.

												What great fun. Why did no one play this game? It's huge, beautiful, and has rewarding combat system. If you have been gaming for a long time it's best to start this on hard mode and forgo crafting armor/weapons. It keeps the game feelings more balanced and challenging through lvl 35. Story has been great.  You have your common tropes as with all fantasy, but there are many unexpected turns and vast amounts of lore.  It balances in the favor of the good storytelling.You should get this game.			",49,26,0,14,2,2,9

												This game is really the most fun I've had with combat anywhere! Sure, the story can get confusing at times but all in all, it's an epic, challenging and beautiful game. Not very original though and a bit limiting when it comes to pathing. If I want to jump off a hill, I should be able to! Or go down the stairs the way I want it etc.As mentioned, the combat is awesome and as a soundtrack lover, I also loved the music. I'd give the game a solid 7 out 10.			",76,33,0,33,16,0,8

												Combat is great with the ability to do combos, dodge, block and engage multiple targets at once. Skills are really well thought out and the world oozes with atmosphere. The story and setting itself are okay and the characters/voice acting are well done. The inventory game gets a little frustrating if you have pack rat tendencies until you put some points in blacksmithing. Overall, it's a really fun game for $5 or $10 dollars.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												KINGDOMS OF AMALUR HERE IT COMES THE RECKONINGKingdoms of Amalur was a surprisingly good fantasy game. It has a fluid and fun combat system. It has a generic but decent storyline. But best of all, it has good side quests. Some of them are even more interesting then the main storyline at times.What I liked most about Kingdoms of Amalur, personally... was how you could build your character in whatever way you wanted. You were not tied down to any restricted class. But you could cross-class between three different trees. Don't like what you ended up doing? No problem. You can re-spec your character at any time during the game. Gold is no object, as there seems to be an over abundance of it in the game. I finished the game with over 6 million pieces of dosh. If that gives you any idea how much money you can make in this.The story goes like this. Your character gets killed doing something he or she shouldn't have been. You come back to life by some mysterious means... and you have the ability to control fate. Now it's time for you to go off and save the world. So yeah that's cool and all. We've heard this kind of plot before. But what is best about the game is the journey through it and the quests you undertake throughout. This game has good beefy side quests with rich story and characters. You wont be wasting your time like with a certain other game that just recently came out.. something with Dragons. Dragon Day I think it was called. Anyway, you'll find that there is a ton to do in this game. If you're a nut about completion this'll take you a good 100 + hours to complete. SO clear you calender, ya dig?Weapons are cool. Each weapon has its own unique style and use. I suggest dicking around with all of them and seeing what you like best. I personally enjoyed the chakrams cause you don't see them much in games, and the daggers because they're the only weapons you can do killmoves with on a sneak attack.The game has a big flaw however and this is one I don't usually complain about with games.. but it was too easy. At level 20... 40 being the max.. I was nigh invincible. It's too easy! I played on normal difficulty, so I recommend maybe playing on Hard if you're not new to RPG's and third person action games in general.The DLCs were both great. Teeth of Narnia & Dead Kenan & Kel had a great storyline and plenty of extra and new content. I'd totally recommend picking up the complete package when it's on sale!So am I missing something? Probably. If you have any questions regarding the game, let me know and i'll answer them post haste.Finale Verdict: (4.4 out of 5)			",241,26,2,22,13,3,22

												At time of writing it is 2:40 a.m. so I'm rantingBUT WHAT A GAME HOLY ****Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a gigantic map of living, breathing npcs woven together by a glossy art style and quirky, sarcastic tones for every serious moment. It prides itself for having a wide selection of combat and adventuring styles, from a measly peasant to a brutal war-mage. You'll find loot for days and a fighting system that delivers satisfying crunches with every impact. I picked up six different builds before I settled on one that fit a medium-range capacity with all the abilities to deal with enemies of every calibre. The game punishes as much as it rains down riches upon you, the player. Keep your eyes peeled and your hands on your keyboard or controller, 'cause there's plenty of things to do from killing to talking to throwing out junk to getting blown up by that one annoying trap to crafting MORE gems to discovering an ancient ruin of a city to getting rejected by that one hottie of an elf. Don't ever trust the game to hold your hand; take what you get and give nothing back.Copious praise aside, there were a few factors which tripped over and otherwise pleasant gameplay experience.There were bugs galore, from broken quests to broken npcs to missing items to items stuck in your inventory. A few of the colour palettes used were neon-nized to the point of frying the rods and cones in your eyeballs. There was so much story in the form of books that if you were to read all that AND read the npc dialogue AND run around looking for treasure, you'd be in the space age before you finished. The skill slotting menu and subsequent settings metres were broken in that they wouldn't move when dragged. Lastly, THERE WERE ONLY 2 DLCS ;_______________;I first got this game when I saw Youtuber @SSoHpkc playing it and it looked fun as hellIt really was fun as hell.BUY IT			",88,5,1,8,6,1,15

												EDIT: After playing more, I can safely say I do really enjoy this game. It's very charming in its own way and the world is pretty big. At the time of this review I've played about 30 hours and I'm only level 10 and still in the starting land!There are some bugs, the camera angle can be annoying at times, auto target is a bit wonky, I really dislike the short render distance (it was ported from consoles so the textures pop in at short distances... just annoying) But overall this is an ""underrated"" game if I ever saw one. It's a slightly flawed gem that should have gotten more attention. I was very sad to learn the studios went bankrupt after making this game because it didn't sell enough copies :( If it had gotten more attention it would have been given the love it deserves. The guy who made this game put all his savings and time into it and it ""failed."" So sad.PROS:-Pretty big world with about 10,000 years of backstory/lore (literally)-Graphics actually look pretty nice-""Cartoony"" look sort of like Fable or Torchlight-Pretty good voice acting-SOOOO many quests and stuff to do! -Nice easy to learn skill system and flexible for any type of playstyle-Works 100% with a gamepad or controller (I myself use an XBOX controller)-RPG elements like a dialogue wheel and choices that affect quests/story-Unique story with a fairly interesting plot-Celtic mythology and lore which you don't see in many games(I myself am Irish so maybe I'm biased...)CONS:-Short render distance so textures pop in obviously all the time-Kind of weird camera angle FOV but there is a mod which fixes that-Some dialogue is a bit cheesy or repetitive now and then... but I find it hilarous :)-Silent main character... this is a con for me because it's quite awkward to have your character just stare at people during dialogue-Combat is a bit tricky.. sometimes it's difficult and sometimes too easy... Basic wolves and other ""fodder"" are the most annoying enemy in the game, while single bosses are easy peasy-Pehaps a bit too much reading, VERY dialogue and text heavy at timesI would still give it about an 8/10. If you like Skyrim, Fable, and Celtic mythology you would definitely enjoy this game :)			",63,24,0,14,7,0,3

												A main storyline playthrough of the game itself is only 26 or so hours. Why the ♥♥♥♥ would I say ONLY? The game has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (200+ hours) of content in sidequests and other content. 200 HOURS!! That's right, crazy. So you're sold on the amount of content, right? But what of the QUALITY. Well, I can confirm each quest, especially a ton of the side quests, has an interesting and unique story that fits into the huge ammount content in this lore filled world. Many of the side quests I've seen allow for alternate rewards and task changing interaction through fully voice-acted dialogue based around your pursuasion (charisma in other games) skill. (Making tue skill actually useful, unlike some games.) The character destiny cards systems encourages awesome hyhbrids of different combat styles and abilities from the three main branches where you can invest ability points. These cards are unlocked based on what trees you invest your AP to add bonus stats and even complete changes to your abilities to make yourself into the exact blend of abilities and strengths you desire.The combat itself introduces a number of skill based fighting mechanics that never seem to lose their weighty and epic feel. This is only added to in the fact that you can make any number of crazy class combinations to tailor your combat experience. Not to mention the weapon and gear options that are also complimented by the epic skills system.The complexity and depth added in the alchemy, blacksmithing, detect hidden, dispelling, lockpicking, mercantile, pursuasion, sagecraft, and stealth skills furthurs the great sense of benefit you get from investing in one skill each level. Each skill builds to greater perks as you invest furthur along in one particular skill, but the gut wrenching decisions you face in deciding where to invest next are what makes you realize the importance of each skill, and the role they serve.The progression of the game overall is at pretty much whatever pace you play at. If you want to rush to train for that next ability, do it. You will be fine, although you might want to bring some extra potions. If instead you want to do some side quests and join guilds for added benefits and rewards, do it. In fact, you can maintain a balance of both. The only qualm (not even that) I have is that if you progress to a furthur area and return to do some quests, they can in some cases seem too easy after becoming more powerful. Which, I don't see it really as a game flaw, because it is just the nature of the RPG genre. For example: after having defeated a dragon and then returning to kill some slimes of any typical rpg would be a walk in the park.I've been through just the tip of the iceberg, and there lies a journey of trials and triumph awaiting you. So,please buy this game, not for me, but yourself. You'll be glad you did.			",554,74,3,67,46,1,77

												Essentially, this game is an EA verison of Elder Scrolls and just as incredible. I've only just begun playing this  game and I'm already taken in by it. From it's immersible gameplay to it's unrivaled scenery, the game is perfect, to say nothing of the epic weaponry. There are four races to choose from with each having it's own unique attributes and the choice of a deity to allign onself with or not at all. There are perks to choosing a deity. Also, like in the Elder Scrolls franchise, you may design your own character down to the facial tattoo, though the designs are less numerous than those in Elder Scrolls, meaning you can't adjust the eye width or scowl lines or anything of that nature. You can, however, choose your own destiny as either a Rogue, an Acolyte, or a Brawler. Overall, the game is an unbeatable 10/10 with it's amount of quests and side-quests. I'm only at Level 3 and I've already found three unbelieveable suits of armour, shields, and weapons. This game is well worth it's cost.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For 20 hours, I wanted to like this and tried as well. Eventually it became too hard to do so. The world is interesting, but there is too much lore and not enough drama and characterization. The choice of graphical style was very poor and is a complete mismatch to the fairly serious tone. Combat system, skill trees and many other things work well enough, but all collapses in face of the difficulty, or lack of it. It is simply impossible to fail in Amalur, and extremely hard to fall in combat. Crafting is so overpowered that loot becomes inessential and it is easy to kill everything with single clicks. Amalur is not moddable either. There is a difficulty mod, but it actually requires CheatEngine to use!			",153,47,0,24,9,1,36

												I wanted this game to be rly great after i saw all reviews, but for me it wasnt total blast in the end.You should buy it is still nice rpg, but I expected something more. The thing that kept me playing was definitely AWESOME Combat sytem. This is 9/10 combat, but camera wasnt that great sometimes but not a huge deal.I hate, that this game doesnt have FOV slider and i couldnt almost play it at original setting so i downloaded 3rd party FOV program (found it in community guides) which made my time with this game much more enjoyable.Also if you are fan of epic story and great storytelling you will be probably kinda dissapointing. Story isn´t awful, but nothing spectacular and storytelling in this game isn´t good enough to keep you invested in characters.All things considered this game is worth trying if you are fan of action combat and want GOOD RPG (dont expect best RPG ever).PS : sorry for typos			",56,13,2,7,6,1,4

												          Seriously, whoever dislike this game IS NOT AN MMO-like FAN ( or s/he might prefer an online game instead ). Surely this game was a discontinued MMO game ... or not the masterpiece of some sort but nontheless it's really fun to play with variety of combo to mess with. Hey you, like to play as ""Battlemage"", """" class or even ""Jack-of-all-trade"" type ? Go ahead!          This game might not have a perfect character creation or mods to change things like ""Skyrim"" ( which is really hurt my feeling a lot after knowing ) but even without mod, you can still enjoy this game in vanilla style.          I can't say how fun or enjoyment this game has to offer for you guys/gals because it's up to your own preferences. If you really dislike getting quest and running around the territories ( assuming you don't have a town marker to fast travel yet ) then this game might not suit your taste. But for me, the hybrid classes and challenging boss fight ( at hardest difficult ) overcome most aspects of this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Open world-ish, with significant amount of things to do, but quite repetitive if you are not used to MMO's. Three main classes, that can combine to form variants (And these variants are supported by the game, wich is nice), lots of perks, crafting, weapons with very cool and unique abilities and skins.Story is terribly cliche, but all in all it's very fun to play.Totally recommand for anybody that is a minimum used to the MMO system.

												This is a really good game with many story lines to follow. And depending which path you choose to take it will always lead to you completing the game I have spent many more hours than quoted on my steam account since I have the game also on other formats due to enjoying it very much well worth its full price. I do believe the DLC well worth buying also since it opens up many more hours of game play and interesting plots to follow. The one thing I do say to look up the alchemy and other crafts for recipes needed throughout the game. It is an easy game to complete if you are a seasoned gamer but still has enough to keep you interested for many hours. I hope you get all the enjoyment I have had whilst playing. It is also one of those games where you can play through and after several months later play again and still finds things you missed before. I have made many characters and enjoyed each one. The only bad point is your toon does not actually use her voice even in cut scenes which is a little annoying but that is like most RPG's			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Kingdoms of Amalur can be too easy, its camera is horrible with a controller and the controls are worse with a keyboard, its quests have a ""quantity over quality"" feel to them, it has the kind of game progression that would be best suited for an MMO, some of the most interesting parts of its world are often told bland and confusingly instead of shown and its story commits a giant sin by being about choice and freedom while offering little of either. Also, its level cap is quite low.Why am I recommending this game, then? Did my finger slip, making me click ""yes"" by accident?Well, this is one of those games where no matter how many annoying or bad points I see, in the end I find myself enjoying it immenselly. It has all those bad things I mentioned, sure, but the timing-focused hacky\slashy\dodgy combat is super enjoyable, the region based world is both easy on the eyes and enourmous without feeling empty, and the characters that inhabit it are mostly interesting even if the game's way of presenting them isn't.Yeah, it's still a hell of a lot of negatives coupled with a few positives, but... well, I still really enjoy it. I think this might be the kind of game that, like Skyrim\Fallout 3 or any other of Bethesda's recent titles (mods aside), is worth way more than the sum of its parts.			",504,168,9,74,37,5,50

												Great game, i have this game in my library pretty much since it was released and never got to try it out, but a few weeks ago i found a documentary about the downfall of 38 studios and found that this game was some kind of test for much bigger tittle that never come to see the light of day (one thing is certain, if it was better that this one, its a shame that never got completed).Im doing this review now bc the game is on sale right now, im at 104 hour in game and didnt completed the game yet (but i usually do every side quest, look every rock and that kind of stuff but didnt touch in any of the dlc story yet, so my money is already worth while).This game is kind of the Fable Lost Chapter with few diferent combat mechanics, many side quests to do, tasks, some story choices that turn things out for good vs evil, and a very well scattered Lore behind all life in Amalur, and believe me, so much Lore, backstory, insane amount of dialogs that you could build another story just was much was rich was this one.The combat is satisfying but there are a few things to keep in mind and avoid to ruin the experience, never enter dungeons before any task told you to, to keep enemy at your level and avoid overpowered character early in game, you cant really do nothing outside of them bc after while, doesnt matter where, enemys are much lower level that you, but dungeons, always bring enemys to your current level.Tasks are a good way to get money or materials since they never end and you can always get the reward for completing them since the moment you accept them.There are so much information to be found in the world, that if you like this kind of background story like me, you have so many hours to get entertainement out of it, and even that the combat sometimes get a bit repetitive, it doesnt really detach you from trying to know more about everything.

If you have been gaming for a long time it's best to start this on hard mode and forgo crafting armor/weapons. It keeps the game feelings more balanced and challenging through lvl 35. Story has been great.  You have your common tropes as with all fantasy, but there are many unexpected turns and vast amounts of lore.  It balances in the favor of the good storytelling.You should get this game.			",49,26,0,14,2,2,9

												Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning is your typical fantasy rpg with a few key differences.Firstly the game is structured much more like an online MMORPG with craftable loot , degredation system and wide expansive areas. HOWEVER they is one key difference:The Combat is amazing. It feels smooth and you can feel the impact of your blows on the enemies;moreover, its also quite forgiving  and only really ges hard if you rush ahead of the areas.The games level system is based on a 3 section upgrade system focusing on MIGHT(melee)  FINNESE(ranged and stealth)SORCERY(magic)These skill tress can be mixed in any combination you like which can lead to intresting combinations of abilities and strategies.It also looks pretty good if you into pretty things but the ccamera angle does not do justice to how beatiful and expansive the game is.On the content side of things they is a massive amount of stuff to do in the game and you could sink hundreds of hours into this(I also played this game for like 200 hours on XBOX).Overall would cautiosly reccomend at full price and whole-heartadly reccomend on sale!

												I would heartily recommend this game for anyone who enjoys RPGs and high fantasy games without too many ttropes that have been trod upon one too many times.At first I thought it was going to be like Skyrim, only less engaging and more cartoony.  It is indeed more cartoony, but if you like helping people out, or are a student of Fae lore, then I think you'll find this game quite engaging.  True, I've put about half the time into it as I've put into Skyrim (and I don't have the DLC for this game), but I ended up enjoying the hell out of myself anyway.There's lots of memorable characters; the voice acting is really well done by a proliferation of actors; and at almost all times you'll feel as if you're really in a magical world.  I thought that part was really well done.And to top it all off, it ran really well on my mid-spec machine.			",216,51,1,33,10,1,47

Honestly, this game is amazing. I bought this game around 4 years ago on EA Origins. I only got to complete the game without the DLC but wow, this game was the greatest game I had ever played at the time. I saw the deal for the game and all the DLC for only $10 and I had to buy it, so I could relive the experience I had back then. If you want to buy and play a game that has: An amazingg soundtrack, Good crafting, an epic storyline, and so much more, I highly recomend this game. The game does have its bugs and can be easy after a certain point, but there is just so much to do in this game. 9/10 ",73,5,0,5,6,0,12

Product received for free
												I had this game on on my wishlist and my good friend bought it for me.  This game start out as a good adventure in a new fantasy world and I was really excited to finally get started playing it.  The first 20 or so hours were really enjoyable trip of collecting quests, beating down some monsters, and reading all of the lore.  I made a point of finishing every quest. Hour 20 - 40, I had had enough of killing the same monsters so I tended to run through dungeons and monsters just so I could finish quests as fast as possible but I was still finishing every quest.  The last 20 hours I was done with the game, I skipped everything that was related to an achievement or the main story and just slammed it home.ProsStory is really goodCombat is pretty fun but there isn't a lot of variability. 5 or 6 moves per weapon.ConsI played on hard and the game was really easy.You will fight the same enemies all game.A lot of quests and items of note in the game are complete rips off of other games but only done half way.

												An enjoyable single character RPG, with a slightly more arcadey feel to the combat than say Skyrim, but just as fun all the same  (unlike Witcher 2 where I found the combat system very frustrating, fiddly and irritating ;) ). I guess everyone has their preferences though. I particularly like how easy it is to use the advanced moves as you progress, they really hit the mark on how they implement this. Think along the lines of Tekken but much much simpler in terms of move combos.For me the lore lacks a little compared to Dragon Age: Origins.There are loads of quests all of which don't seem to provide too much of a challenge, but they do give you a purpose to explore the game world. The fast travel system allows you to avoid the respawns if that annoys you.Not had any problems running this on Windows 10, only slight issue I have is that it will ""flash"" out of the game window and into W10 once every time I load the save game, but then immediately returns to the game without an issue. Probably this is where people would experience the problem with crashes. My system is a few years old and is probably mid-range, probably indicating any issues will be local rather than with the game itself. I also have the flashing into windows 10 on other older games from time to time so no big deal.Game bugs? I did get stuck in the floor of one cave system when running during combat, nothing unusual after getting stuck in things in both Skyrim and other RPGs loool, just go back to last save/autosave and sorted.Good crafting system in place, if anything too many options and took me a while to start to get to grips with all the aspects/menus etc, as the manual is lacking in detail and there is not much in game explanation of features, but in the end it is sort of intuitive and works well.Usually I am a keyboard and mouse guy for RPGs, but this works very well with an Xbox360 controller, and made it easier to pick up the aspects of the game - feels like too many keys otherwise :DWhat else to say? Think I picked it up for under £10 with all DLCs and it certainly looks worth the money - graphics and music are fine as well. If you don't want the money based grind of the current MMOs around, and prefer a single player experience, this is well worth a try.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had been playing this game on the Xbox 360 for a number of months now and I really enjoyed playing the game. Today, I decided to move up to the PC version, as well as get all of the DLC packs for the game too. It's a shame this game isn't more popular than it is. The story of the game isn't the best I've ever seen (but that doesn't mean it's bad, it's still good) but combat works really well - it's fast, fluid and very responsive. I prefer playing the game with the Xbox 360 controller simply because it allows you to be more efficient (or I just haven't gotten used to keyboard controls yet) but between the controller and keyboard combat is really good. Dare I say it's superior to Skyrim's combat?That's not to mention the really large world to explore with endless objects to collect and many quests to complete - side, story and faction, interesting and challenging enemies to fight, deep lore and really nicely crafted worldspaces - and that doesn't even include the DLC packs. Conversation works similar to how it does in Mass Effect and Dragon Age: Inquisition - you have a wheel to choose various conversation options, which of course affect how a character views you and can dictate the outcome of a quest or even the storyline. I'm a little disappointed that the player character (which you can customize, though not quite to the extent of how you can in Skyrim, Dragon Age or even Mass effect) isn't voice-acted, but then again, the player character in Skyrim isn't voice-acted either, and look at how well-regarded that game is. The game's graphics are pretty good. Obviously for a game that's about 4 years old at the time of this review, they aren't cutting-edge but I am quite happy with how the game looks and how well-optimized it appears to be. I've got the game running with the graphics settings cranked to the max on my laptop that wasn't even super high-end when it was new and it maintains a very consistent and steady framerate well above 45-50 frames per second.It truly is disappointing that this game's developer went out of business and there'll probably not be any follow-up games to Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning (a title which is probably intended to foreshadow future titles, I might add) because it is a universe I wouldn't mind exploring in even greater detail. This game is absolutely worth the $20CAD price ($40CAD for the Collection), and I would recommend the DLC packs as well, even though the base game is very feature-rich as it is, which is something I can't say about most new games released today.

												Spent 40 hours in the demo before release (replayed it several times over to try the different playstyles, and used cheats to see everything the demo offered-- it turns out, most of the abilities in the game!), and many more when I owned it on Origin. Of course, the DLC never went on sale on Origin, so during the 2016 winter sale I picked up KoA and both expansions for only $10, the cost of ONE of the expansions on Origin. This game is not without its flaws. It can feel like a single player MMO at times. The story can be a bit predictable at times. And at times, especially the late game, it's rather unbalanced, but thankfully, in favor of the player. Ultimately, though? I had fun. A lot of it. It may feel like a single player MMO at times, but KoA doesn't insist on making you look like some impoverished peasant when you first start the game, so there's that.Gameplay wise, as you level up you put ability points into either Might, Finesse, or  Sorcery. The combination of points invested therein allows you to choose various ""Destinies"", which are character specializations with various ability prerequisites. You can change Destinies on the fly, though honestly I can't remember for sure if you can respec your Might, Finesse, and Sorcery investments. Each tree represents an RPG archetype. Might the warrior, Finesse the rogue, and Sorcery the mage. Each archetype has multiple weapon types, such as onehanded and shield or two handed for Might builds, Daggers or Faeblades for Finesse builds, and Staves or Chakrams for Sorcery builds. There are a few more, as I recall wands and some kind of throwing knives but It's been a while so I don't remember the details. In addition, your character has a bow with unlimited arrows, but it features a recharging ""magazine"" mechanic: you have a maximum number of arrows, and if you stop shooting for a few seconds, they will begin to quickly regnerate. I don't remember if Might or Sorcery have any major skills related to the bow, but Finesse users can turn the bow into a veritable weapon of destruction.			",261,34,4,46,16,6,51

												This is a great Action RPG, giving you lots of fun combos, magic play, crafting and almost Fable Like experience.If you want any difficulty at all with this game, do not pick up crafting. The items you craft in this game exceed the games items, so if you want any challange. Focus in other skills.			",69,9,0,30,3,0,11

												I had been playing this game on the Xbox 360 for a number of months now and I really enjoyed playing the game. Today, I decided to move up to the PC version, as well as get all of the DLC packs for the game too. It's a shame this game isn't more popular than it is. The story of the game isn't the best I've ever seen (but that doesn't mean it's bad, it's still good) but combat works really well - it's fast, fluid and very responsive. I prefer playing the game with the Xbox 360 controller simply because it allows you to be more efficient (or I just haven't gotten used to keyboard controls yet) but between the controller and keyboard combat is really good. Dare I say it's superior to Skyrim's combat?That's not to mention the really large world to explore with endless objects to collect and many quests to complete - side, story and faction, interesting and challenging enemies to fight, deep lore and really nicely crafted worldspaces - and that doesn't even include the DLC packs. Conversation works similar to how it does in Mass Effect and Dragon Age: Inquisition - you have a wheel to choose various conversation options, which of course affect how a character views you and can dictate the outcome of a quest or even the storyline. I'm a little disappointed that the player character (which you can customize, though not quite to the extent of how you can in Skyrim, Dragon Age or even Mass effect) isn't voice-acted, but then again, the player character in Skyrim isn't voice-acted either, and look at how well-regarded that game is. The game's graphics are pretty good. Obviously for a game that's about 4 years old at the time of this review, they aren't cutting-edge but I am quite happy with how the game looks and how well-optimized it appears to be. I've got the game running with the graphics settings cranked to the max on my laptop that wasn't even super high-end when it was new and it maintains a very consistent and steady framerate well above 45-50 frames per second.It truly is disappointing that this game's developer went out of business and there'll probably not be any follow-up games to Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning (a title which is probably intended to foreshadow future titles, I might add) because it is a universe I wouldn't mind exploring in even greater detail. This game is absolutely worth the $20CAD price ($40CAD for the Collection), and I would recommend the DLC packs as well, even though the base game is very feature-rich as it is, which is something I can't say about most new games released today.

												Spent 40 hours in the demo before release (replayed it several times over to try the different playstyles, and used cheats to see everything the demo offered-- it turns out, most of the abilities in the game!), and many more when I owned it on Origin. Of course, the DLC never went on sale on Origin, so during the 2016 winter sale I picked up KoA and both expansions for only $10, the cost of ONE of the expansions on Origin. This game is not without its flaws. It can feel like a single player MMO at times. The story can be a bit predictable at times. And at times, especially the late game, it's rather unbalanced, but thankfully, in favor of the player. Ultimately, though? I had fun. A lot of it. It may feel like a single player MMO at times, but KoA doesn't insist on making you look like some impoverished peasant when you first start the game, so there's that.Gameplay wise, as you level up you put ability points into either Might, Finesse, or  Sorcery. The combination of points invested therein allows you to choose various ""Destinies"", which are character specializations with various ability prerequisites. You can change Destinies on the fly, though honestly I can't remember for sure if you can respec your Might, Finesse, and Sorcery investments. Each tree represents an RPG archetype. Might the warrior, Finesse the rogue, and Sorcery the mage. Each archetype has multiple weapon types, such as onehanded and shield or two handed for Might builds, Daggers or Faeblades for Finesse builds, and Staves or Chakrams for Sorcery builds. There are a few more, as I recall wands and some kind of throwing knives but It's been a while so I don't remember the details. In addition, your character has a bow with unlimited arrows, but it features a recharging ""magazine"" mechanic: you have a maximum number of arrows, and if you stop shooting for a few seconds, they will begin to quickly regnerate. I don't remember if Might or Sorcery have any major skills related to the bow, but Finesse users can turn the bow into a veritable weapon of destruction.			",261,34,4,46,16,6,51

Definately worth buying as it goes on sale freqently. The ability to craft weapons and to respec your class means you could mix things up without having to create a new character.

												A beautiful and absolutely massive RPG that holds its own against all of the more well known games in the genre. It lacks some of the polish huge budget games like The Witcher or Dragon Age have, but the gameplay, story, and world are all excellent.

												I heard allot of good stuff about this game. It was kind of like the epidemic of everyone telling you over and over again to watch Breaking Bad. ""You don't watch Breaking Bad!!! YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT!"" and from 100 different people each week until you finally just give in and watch it and realise what the heck you was missing! This game was like that. Every corner I turn I was hearing ""Have you played Reckoning yet??"" ""Dude you have to play Reckoning, Seriously!"" So I finally said heck with it and bought it. And there has not been one single shred of regret. You may know how it is to have a ton of games you have purchased in your steam library and you play one for a while and get bored and go to the next for a while. And with so many games you can't fully get into one certain game. And kind of wish you was stuck with just one game so you would be forced to enjoy it without feeling like you are missing out somewhere else. Well this game here has pretty much did that for me. Because there is no other game out there right now comparable to this so my Steam library might as well only have reckoning on the list. One of those games where you are thinking about it constantly when you are out of the house and soon as you walk in the door you push the button on the computer to get it prepped for some playage. If you are an RPG and or Hack and Slash fan this game will be your best friend. You will be buying the T-Shirts and watching youtube videos and drinking out of a reckoning coffee cup you purchased from china off ebay. It really is a great game. So stop reading this right now and purchase it so you can go ahead and get the download started. I love you...er...where did that come from...sorry..			",31,2,0,6,2,0,1

7/10As RPG's go, this one is sticks to a classic mold but mixes things up enough to make it worthwhile.The Good: Being able to mix and match between warrior, rogue and mage archetypes is probably the best part of the game. Few other games (outside of Skyrim, because that's in a league of its own) can deliver this well, if at all. Even the storyline plays into this aspect of the game which I found to be pretty damn clever. Plus, if you don't like your current skill set, you can pay some gold and change it. And the gold amount needed is relatively small considering your resetting your skills.The Bad: The voice acting is painfully bad in some cases which can be really annoying. Also, while the mixing and matching I mentioned above is great, combining classes (i.e. rogue and mage) can be a nuisance since it takes an excessive amount of time to get to the next skill tier. There is such a thing a TOO MUCH balance.The Ugly: I found the crafting system to be borderline pathetic. Minimal depth to it and using a skill doesn't improve it at all but merely gives miniscule generic experience. On another note, the quests often spread themselves out too much forcing you to traverse half the map to complete many quests rather early in the game.Long story short, if you want a fun, easy to play RPG with some unique quirks (good ones at that), then pick this game up!

												The game is well-paced as an action RPG. But, because it was formerly an MMO in development, the whole structure suffers, somewhat, from a multitude of bland quests. Later in the game I've noticed some botched up voice acting too. However, these are just the flaws put up front, the game itself is glorious in it's features. The storyline also happens to be quite good, although the end is totally expected yet not disappointing in terms of combat. All things considered, the game is a long trek for completionists, one which I hope you will find enjoyable too. Have fun!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The best way I could describe this game is World of Warcraft meets Skyrim.Amalur has a lot going for it in the way of efficient dialogue, skilled voice actors, spectacular combat animations, and masterful music.Amalur falters, however, in inheriting the problems of WoW and Skyrim: frustrating inventory system (at the beginning of the game when you don't have a Stash yet), tedious quests, repetitive fights, very long travel distances, and not the most engaging plotline I've followed.  The game kind of feels like it's trying to be too much for too many people; the way instructions are worded makes one think this were an introductory RPG (as compared to much more detail-oriented games like Divinity).  This irked me, strangely.I still recommend the game.  It's not ""bad"" per se, but falls short on too many levels to keep it from holding more profound players.  It's a 60-hour hack'n'slash with some great role-playing bits (not in terms of the story, ironically, but in how you want to approach combat) that you might like in spite of the amount of running you do.  Suggest picking it up on a sale.			",226,10,2,21,11,0,33

												In general a great game that is easy to play either for a quick 5 minute bash or a complete quest.Only complaint is that it still has bugs such as a killed enemy's image remains standing after death and unable to complete the last 2 conquests because suddenly the weapons no longer work once you leave Camp Moondown.Bit frustrating but overall plenty of hours of mindless killing fun.

												BEST. FANTASY. GAME.EVER. I prefer it to Skyrim, I had a serious injury and was housebound for a long time. I started with WoW which was cool an novel, but it never really grabbed me and pulled me in. On a whim I bought Kingdoms of Amarlur, hoping to have it deliver a WoW like single player experience.  KoA:R did all that and then some! I'd say it's my favorite RPG/Comnat game by a pretty wide margin. The stories are amazing, the harvesting of alchemical reagents isn't too hard (like in WoW when you'd have to circle one zone for hours just to get the mats for one potion) but it isn't a total gimmee either. The combat is real time, meaning that you actively block, dodge, pary, and counterattack as you get more used to the controls. The story could EASILY be made into a movie. The graphics are great by 2012 standards, and certainly no worse than WoW, and the non-linear progression of the story is amazing. If you get the Teeth of Naros and Dead Kel extension packs you can get a stupid amount of playtime out of it; both first time through and replay. I spent a lot of time tweaking out my main character into a God in the game, and wound up spending 244 hours on that one toon. I alo have several other character since I wanted to try all the different combinations of  Warrior/Mage/Ranger/Assasing and various mixes of them. You have total control over the developmet of your character, but be aware that if you kill an NPC, dude is GONE, so ne sure to preeditate, becaue some of the decisions you make have far reaching consequences.

												This game is the LoveChild of Skyrim and Fable. It acts a little more like it's father (Skyrim) and looks a little more like it's mother (Fable). But in all aspects of gameplay you can feel both of it's parents. I LOVE this game and I've only played for about an hour.			",21,6,0,15,3,0,3

												Kingdoms of Amalur manages to combine an interesting number of gameplay elements. To me at least, it seems to have a similar feel to an older, single-player computer RPG, like Gothic or Die by the Sword - yet at the same time, it contains many modern gameplay features and conventions. The combat is fairly button-combo heavy and is fairly similar to Fable - even the character progression paths (Warrior, Rogue, Wizard) follow the same lines. Each area is filled with NPCs who will offer various main or side quests, and tasks, all courtesy of the glowy exclamation points floating over their heads, as is the trend for seemingly every RPG nowadays (not just MMOs anymore, it seems!) The main quest is fairly good, but it is even easier to get lured off by the sheer amount of side quests and faction storylines to follow. The faction quest lines serve to drive you from one area to the next just as much as the main storyline does, so I suppose that in theory, you could ignore the main quest completely and just play the additional content - there is certainly enough of it to reach the level cap well before the game ends.The game world itself is huge; it's easy to tell that this was designed as a prototype for an MMO, even though it still feels like a single-player map - the way much of it is designed, it's doubtful that it could've accomodated a large number of players. The areas are sprawling, however, though they can be traversed fairly easily on foot, in my opinion, without them feeling like a slog. Even the smallest area map has a number of small nooks and crannies off the beaten path that will yield treasure, lore, or crafting materials - although many of these cannot be acquired without the proper skills to unlock them. While in theory this provides an incentive to return to older areas later on when a character is more skilled, more often than not the treasure is not worth the effort. However, each area is dotted with a variety of runestones that provide you with lore and passive bonuses if you manage to find them all, which encourages full exploration. The game has a robust crafting system that is based upon breaking down items into components that can then be used to forge new weapons and armor, depending on the type. Additional components can be added, if available, to make the final product better, and gems can be added to slotted gear to add extra magical effects (gems, too, can be combined to make more potent versions). While some fairly good gear can be purchased, the best items are rare, expensive, and hard to find - more often than not, by the mid-game, the best equipment you will end up with is stuff that you make yourself. A fairly good alchemy system also exists, with the standard gathering of plants and combining them to discover different effects, then using them to brew useful potions.The game suffers from some bugs, namely in the inventory and quest system. Many quest or plot-related items remain in your inventory indefinitely, and whether or not they take up physical space in your collection seems to be an arbitrary distinction. While the ability to expand your inventory exists, these upgrades are fairly scarce, external storage is limited, and most quest items cannot even be stored - you're stuck carrying them forever. The lack of companions to carry excess items, combined with a limited inventory size, can make loot runs back into town frustratingly frequent. There is also no way to remove unwanted or incomplete quests from your journal, which can develop some annoying glitches once your total number of active quests tops a certain number. The simple gathering tasks you acquire in each town can be helpful to do once or twice, but having one from a place you visited four towns and twenty levels ago stuck in your quest list for the rest of the game can be irritating. While the progression trees are fairly straightforwards and each contain some impressive abilities, the skill system is somewhat cumbersome. So many of the skills are so useful (arguably essential) that you really want, if not need, all of them - and yet skill progression, compared to level and ability gain, is painfully slow. You can pay certain NPCs to train you in a skill, giving you an extra point; however, the catch is that you can only receive this training if your skill is still below a certain rank. Early in the game, this is too expensive to pay for; by the time you can afford the training and return, chances are you will be too skilled to get the training, forcing you to repeatedly re-spec and travel backwards step by step, hunting for each trainer in the order that you found them in, if you want to acquire every skill point available (unless of course you choose to follow the Rogue's path).Sadly, the collapse of the development studio and the lack of any further support for the game makes the chances of getting patches or other updates very remote. This is definitely a game that would benefit from some bug-fixes and mods. The fact that neither of the two DLC expansions bothered to increase the level cap means that even without using experience boosts, you will likely reach max level well before you finish the game (though I suppose it depends on how much of a completionist you are). The inclusion of ten to twenty more levels and some sort of alternate advancement/fourth ability tree would have made a nice addition to the extra content. All in all, I think that KOA:R is an enjoyable game that is well worth picking up for the price. It has a fair amount of replay value and certainly has more than enough content to spare for anyone looking for a good fantasy adventure. The main story, while perhaps not quite original, is compelling enough, and the setting unique enough that it doesn't feel quite as cliched as some of the more standard fantasy RPG fare. While I do not think that it is for everyone, depending on your own personal taste, the gameplay is solid and the game itself quite enjoyable if you can get past the interface/game system bugs.

												At first, I did not like this game that much because I saw too many settings copied from The Elder Scroll V. Skyrim is the best RPG game I've played ever so I thought of such behaviors as stealing.After playing a couple of hours, I tried to restart to feeling the game and did not skip the dialogues though I considered them not touching. Slowing down my step, I found out that the style of view is also amazing in another way and the moves of characters are quite smooth.The open world and wide range of items must be along with a well RPG game, and Amalur does not lack anyone of them. It combines many good settings of lots of games. It has its flaws for sure, and I'll definitely choose Skyrim when these two games are at the same price. This is still good game worth being recomended.I really enjoy playing this game and it's just a beginning of my path.			",64,3,1,19,6,0,3

												It's hard to explain what is so enjoyable about this game. Whilst the map feels vastly underpopulated and it is obvious from the design of the surroundings that this was intended to be a MMORPG, I think that adds a certain charm. Feeling tiny in a world so huge is part of the experience. It did take me a while to get fully into the lore, and I wouldn't say I'm quite there yet, but you can certainly play the game without understanding the fuss about these 'Fae' or why everyone argues over this 'Mitharu' fellow. The DLCs are absolutely fantastic and expand what is already a vast, multi-faceted world. The creativity behind this game is evident in every last corner. Though the character customisation is limited, that is probably a good thing, as I like to spend hours upon hours getting my hero's eyebrows JUST RIGHT. It's also worth mentioning that the customisation extends into gameplay; the class system is, in my opinion, without fault. It's user-friendly, it enables users to play whatever combination of skillsets they choose, and it has a system of specialisation that other RPGs, I felt, were missing.All in all, buy the game. Just buy it. Now.			",56,12,0,19,3,0,1

												Even within a few hours of playing it it has easily become one of my favorite RPGs to play. Play style isn't just a cast bar with abilites tied to your 1-10 numbers, it combines click action gameplay with classic RPG play styles. I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys good stories with amazing combat. Another thing that I would like to point out is the character customization beyond physical features. The game allows you to create the perfect character based on your details. Create a Shadow Mage, a pure Mage, or a Battle Mage. The game covers each possibility that you could think of when creating a class for your character. Best part is, you can respec at anytime. Perfect.			",43,2,1,8,1,0,0

												Similar to Skyrim (and other Elder Scrolls games), but with an ""over-the-shoulder"" fixed camera system that makes for highly intense combat situations. There are lots of options regarding weapons and moves; and the skill tree adds a layer of customization and flexibility to make the gaming experience a bit more personal. One of the reasons for the comparison to Skyrim is because, just like in Skyrim, you may buy your own home(s) to use as a sort of ""home base"" on your adventures. My only complaint is that I wish there was a High Resolution Texture Pack (or mod) for this game because the graphics, while decent enough, have been directly ported over from the console(s), as far as I know. It would have been nice to have seen some PC-centric graphics options for this game. Overall, an epic adventure worthy of a fantasy lover's time!			",240,47,0,16,6,1,7

												In KoA you play the fateless one.

												A game I think I will forever be quite sad about. The only real disapointment I had was the fact that this game failed, or I should say, the company went bankrupt after one of their deals was backed out of. This game was a beautiful master piece, and I'd have loved to see more content, and would have gladly bought every last peice of DLC, because unlike most games, the DLC for this was well worth it. The game itself was beautiful to even look at. Often I'd find myself looking up, and just being blown away at the massive amounts of detail. The fact that there won't be a sequal, or any new content like this, is depressing. For a first attempt, I think they nailed it, and a second attempt at the game would only sweeten it even more.

												I find it difficult to find an RPG that I can continuously come back to without getting bored of, and I have played Skyrim. In comparison to KoA, Skyrim is similar, but a little less immersive. The world of KoA is beautiful. The lore and the main story are well-written, and make the playing even more enjoyable. And the combat is fluid, and fun.Let's judge.(COMBAT)The primary and secondary weapon system makes it so much easier to transition from a long-range to close-range weapon, or a slow weapon to a fast, or any sort of pairing one can think of. The different types of weapon (Chakrams, Greatsword, Hammer, Longsword, Daggers, Staves, Scepters, Faeblades, and Bows) provide much entertainment in battle.No complexity nonsense with the controls. Movements are fluid and there are only 2 buttons. Mashing doesn't always work-- dodging is a necessity, making it less lifeless and more active. I suppose it is a little repetitive, but I find it fun, personally. (I might be wrong.)Also, the whole ""you choose your own fate"" idea makes it easy to go down whatever path you want to, whether it be finesse, sorcery, or might. You can even have hybrid combinations.Cool note: your dodge, if you take the finesse/sorcery route, can be replaced by a short-range teleport, which can later deal poison damage if you teleport through enemies. (LORE)You have what I call ""lorestones"" scattered all over the world. The loading screens give you tidbits, and the cutscenes are, if nothing else, pretty. Dialogue with NPCs allow you to delve deeper into the story if you want to.I love the whole fantasy-world-in-danger spin.Also, you are ""fateless"".  You're bound by nothing at all. And you have an uber-super-cool special kill mode.(GRAPHICS)I love games with beautiful graphics. Some pixelated games, too, work well, but KoA is far from pixelated. The faces are smooth, the armor and weapons are pretty, and the world is vivid. Walking through the forests or the swamps or the cities is an immersive experience in itself.(CRAFTING SYSTEM)You can salvage items you don't feel like selling for components, which can then be used to forge the weapon of your dreams. Weapon customization at its finest. You can use gems as supplements, and (this is a small thing, but it's great) you can name your carefully crafted weapon, or armor. Name your longsword ""Bootybuster"" or something. Not that I would.(THE FINAL VERDICT)Yo, buy this. I was looking for a good RPG for a long while. I bought this along with The Last Remnant (which I also HIGHLY recommend) and found that I loved it.10/10 <3			",59,6,0,16,6,0,2

												27 hours played, I have this game on Origin too.  Rpgs are not my thing, but this game grabbed my attention. The fighting style is very fun, reminds me of God of War, especially when you get chakrams. The story drew me in enough to do a speed run because I really wanted to know more about my character and some others. The skill tree is a little lacking, there are 3 categories Sorcery, Might and Finesse. Each category has a few skills you aquire and upgrade, when you put enough points to a skill you unlock the next tier. The environment looks amazing and drastically changes depending where you go. There are many side quests and encounters that lead to one. I have nothing bad to say about this game and i've found no bugs yet.			",81,4,1,3,4,0,1

												Do you want a game that could be compared as the arcade feeling The Elder Scrolls with with too many side quests to deal with? Then this game is right for you. At the start, you were a dead person, and resurrected by a gnome. Eventually you will be fated to be three archetypes: Warrior (representing Might), a Rogue (representing Finesse), or a Sorcerer (representing Sorcery). During your time, you may swap points around any, or all three of these fields to get a nice mix-match of what kind of character you want to build. Sounds great at the start, but sadly the further you go to see a pattern of go to this region and do mindless side-quests that may get you so sidetracked that you may forget what you were meant to be doing with the main storyline. Especially in my case when I took a year long break because of said mindless sidequests.Combat system is not that bad, but it is not that great either. You are allowed to hold two weapons at a time, yet both, or any of the weapons do have a limiting combo system. Best way to describe is just pressing X X X or B B B with a hint of X ""pause"" X ""pause"" X. Catch my drift. Too bad the baddies in the game do not hold up in the variety party. Could be a good thing when you do not have to remember how enemies attack, and can anticipate any attacks.After the combat comes the spoils, and it feels like the loot got spoiled. In the beginning, when you have nothing to use everything is great loot. By the time you come around your twenties or thiry levels the look; much like any dungeon crawler, can be sparse in quality. Even the armor sets could not hold a candle to some of the blue or even green armors that I had been picking up which makes you wonder if picking the lock of an average or higher difficult chest is worth the trouble.Speaking of lock picking; there are skills you can either pick up from leveling or some NPCs that you meet along the way. Most of these NPCs may only teach you so much in skill levels that it can be hard to find ones that can teach you further deep into the high ranks; even at areas where it should be level appropriate. Otherwise, most of the skills can you help you further into your adventure especially one to find all the hidden goodies. I did wish the crafting skills could make armor that would of been your end all to be all armor or weapons.Pros:+ You got PLENTY to do+ Though limiting archetypes, but you can mix them up+ Gorgeous world even at this point of the review it still holds up well.+ Decent skill system with worth while skills to achieveCons:- Too many side quests, but it is up to you if you want to bother- Lackluster loot at the end, and crafting weapon and armor is not much worth it. Shame...- Not much variety of enemies, and not much variety of a combat systemEven though I said a fair share of gripes with this game, but I did played through to the end, even if it was a bit painful if you are one that wants to finish all the quests. Without a middle recommendation, I am still going to recommend, but during a sale.			",280,36,6,36,21,6,38

												The best way I could describe this game is World of Warcraft meets Skyrim.Amalur has a lot going for it in the way of efficient dialogue, skilled voice actors, spectacular combat animations, and masterful music.Amalur falters, however, in inheriting the problems of WoW and Skyrim: frustrating inventory system (at the beginning of the game when you don't have a Stash yet), tedious quests, repetitive fights, very long travel distances, and not the most engaging plotline I've followed.  The game kind of feels like it's trying to be too much for too many people; the way instructions are worded makes one think this were an introductory RPG (as compared to much more detail-oriented games like Divinity).  This irked me, strangely.I still recommend the game.  It's not ""bad"" per se, but falls short on too many levels to keep it from holding more profound players.  It's a 60-hour hack'n'slash with some great role-playing bits (not in terms of the story, ironically, but in how you want to approach combat) that you might like in spite of the amount of running you do.  Suggest picking it up on a sale.			",226,10,2,21,11,0,33

												A surprisingly well made game. The graphics is not spectacular (though the combat animations and spell effects are good) and the game does not bring anything really new to the genre, the combat is excellent and the possibilities to progress your characters are many - want to be a rogue with chakrams and combat magic? No problem. Want to be a warrior in heavy armor, wielding huge warhammer and summoning skeletons to help you in fight? Go for it.There is plenty of side quests, usually involving finding something/killing somebody/stealing something. There is not much variety, but the quests lead you through the areas and into loads of combat, so you do not really care as long as you can slaughter some boggarts and brownies (yes, you heard me).The world is quite huge and open, if you want, you can just explore and roam and kill stuff, though do not expect Skyrim here.The game also offers a straightforward crafting system including weapons, armor, potions and socketable gems.8/10Worth your money, worth your time.

												This game has pretty much zero plot.  While dialog trees resemble those of games where your choices matter such as Mass Effect, the game is totally linear and your choices have no effect.  That said, this game is incredibly fun.  Combat is amazing - easy to pick up and difficult to master.  It's like a less frustrating Dark Souls.  This game makes it a joy to run around across the open world killing everything in your path.  I made the mistake of not picking up the DLC when it was on sale, then I ran out of stuff to kill.  Get the whole thing when it's on discount and you'll have many hours to come of stabbing, zapping, crushing, and otherwise raining hurt down on your enemies.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Love, love, love, this game. It's very story driven which is a huge plus for me. The main quest is fun and entertaining with lots of additional side quests. The only thing I disliked is that sometimes the camera feels like it is very zoomed in and you don't seem to have much control over it at times but that is a very minor issues and does not affect game play.

												It has a really good story line, very well made characters, super fun combat style and crafting options. Only thing that I belive truly piiss people off is the jump option, but I think they did an AWESOME job with the game anyway.It's sad that this game didn't get as popular as it should. I think it's underrated, I love fantasy RPGs and I can say I had loads of fun playing this game. I wont lie, it has a lot of thing that most RPG fans would hate but worth it in the end. It's fun and I say, get it and play, now more then ever because EA games has announced they will release a KOAR 2. So this one first.			",177,11,7,29,12,2,17

This is more more linear and the leveling up system isn't great.The pros are that it has greate colors and graphics, beautiful scenery and a half decent story. I would give it a 6/10.

												An enjoyable single character RPG, with a slightly more arcadey feel to the combat than say Skyrim, but just as fun all the same  (unlike Witcher 2 where I found the combat system very frustrating, fiddly and irritating ;) ). I guess everyone has their preferences though. I particularly like how easy it is to use the advanced moves as you progress, they really hit the mark on how they implement this. Think along the lines of Tekken but much much simpler in terms of move combos.For me the lore lacks a little compared to Dragon Age: Origins.There are loads of quests all of which don't seem to provide too much of a challenge, but they do give you a purpose to explore the game world. The fast travel system allows you to avoid the respawns if that annoys you.Not had any problems running this on Windows 10, only slight issue I have is that it will ""flash"" out of the game window and into W10 once every time I load the save game, but then immediately returns to the game without an issue. Probably this is where people would experience the problem with crashes. My system is a few years old and is probably mid-range, probably indicating any issues will be local rather than with the game itself. I also have the flashing into windows 10 on other older games from time to time so no big deal.Game bugs? I did get stuck in the floor of one cave system when running during combat, nothing unusual after getting stuck in things in both Skyrim and other RPGs loool, just go back to last save/autosave and sorted.Good crafting system in place, if anything too many options and took me a while to start to get to grips with all the aspects/menus etc, as the manual is lacking in detail and there is not much in game explanation of features, but in the end it is sort of intuitive and works well.Usually I am a keyboard and mouse guy for RPGs, but this works very well with an Xbox360 controller, and made it easier to pick up the aspects of the game - feels like too many keys otherwise :DWhat else to say? Think I picked it up for under £10 with all DLCs and it certainly looks worth the money - graphics and music are fine as well. If you don't want the money based grind of the current MMOs around, and prefer a single player experience, this is well worth a try.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had been playing this game on the Xbox 360 for a number of months now and I really enjoyed playing the game. Today, I decided to move up to the PC version, as well as get all of the DLC packs for the game too. It's a shame this game isn't more popular than it is. The story of the game isn't the best I've ever seen (but that doesn't mean it's bad, it's still good) but combat works really well - it's fast, fluid and very responsive. I prefer playing the game with the Xbox 360 controller simply because it allows you to be more efficient (or I just haven't gotten used to keyboard controls yet) but between the controller and keyboard combat is really good. Dare I say it's superior to Skyrim's combat?That's not to mention the really large world to explore with endless objects to collect and many quests to complete - side, story and faction, interesting and challenging enemies to fight, deep lore and really nicely crafted worldspaces - and that doesn't even include the DLC packs. Conversation works similar to how it does in Mass Effect and Dragon Age: Inquisition - you have a wheel to choose various conversation options, which of course affect how a character views you and can dictate the outcome of a quest or even the storyline. I'm a little disappointed that the player character (which you can customize, though not quite to the extent of how you can in Skyrim, Dragon Age or even Mass effect) isn't voice-acted, but then again, the player character in Skyrim isn't voice-acted either, and look at how well-regarded that game is. The game's graphics are pretty good. Obviously for a game that's about 4 years old at the time of this review, they aren't cutting-edge but I am quite happy with how the game looks and how well-optimized it appears to be. I've got the game running with the graphics settings cranked to the max on my laptop that wasn't even super high-end when it was new and it maintains a very consistent and steady framerate well above 45-50 frames per second.It truly is disappointing that this game's developer went out of business and there'll probably not be any follow-up games to Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning (a title which is probably intended to foreshadow future titles, I might add) because it is a universe I wouldn't mind exploring in even greater detail. This game is absolutely worth the $20CAD price ($40CAD for the Collection), and I would recommend the DLC packs as well, even though the base game is very feature-rich as it is, which is something I can't say about most new games released today.

												Spent 40 hours in the demo before release (replayed it several times over to try the different playstyles, and used cheats to see everything the demo offered-- it turns out, most of the abilities in the game!), and many more when I owned it on Origin. Of course, the DLC never went on sale on Origin, so during the 2016 winter sale I picked up KoA and both expansions for only $10, the cost of ONE of the expansions on Origin. This game is not without its flaws. It can feel like a single player MMO at times. The story can be a bit predictable at times. And at times, especially the late game, it's rather unbalanced, but thankfully, in favor of the player. Ultimately, though? I had fun. A lot of it. It may feel like a single player MMO at times, but KoA doesn't insist on making you look like some impoverished peasant when you first start the game, so there's that.Gameplay wise, as you level up you put ability points into either Might, Finesse, or  Sorcery. The combination of points invested therein allows you to choose various ""Destinies"", which are character specializations with various ability prerequisites. You can change Destinies on the fly, though honestly I can't remember for sure if you can respec your Might, Finesse, and Sorcery investments. Each tree represents an RPG archetype. Might the warrior, Finesse the rogue, and Sorcery the mage. Each archetype has multiple weapon types, such as onehanded and shield or two handed for Might builds, Daggers or Faeblades for Finesse builds, and Staves or Chakrams for Sorcery builds. There are a few more, as I recall wands and some kind of throwing knives but It's been a while so I don't remember the details. In addition, your character has a bow with unlimited arrows, but it features a recharging ""magazine"" mechanic: you have a maximum number of arrows, and if you stop shooting for a few seconds, they will begin to quickly regnerate. I don't remember if Might or Sorcery have any major skills related to the bow, but Finesse users can turn the bow into a veritable weapon of destruction.			",261,34,4,46,16,6,51

												The best way I could describe this game is World of Warcraft meets Skyrim.Amalur has a lot going for it in the way of efficient dialogue, skilled voice actors, spectacular combat animations, and masterful music.Amalur falters, however, in inheriting the problems of WoW and Skyrim: frustrating inventory system (at the beginning of the game when you don't have a Stash yet), tedious quests, repetitive fights, very long travel distances, and not the most engaging plotline I've followed.  The game kind of feels like it's trying to be too much for too many people; the way instructions are worded makes one think this were an introductory RPG (as compared to much more detail-oriented games like Divinity).  This irked me, strangely.I still recommend the game.  It's not ""bad"" per se, but falls short on too many levels to keep it from holding more profound players.  It's a 60-hour hack'n'slash with some great role-playing bits (not in terms of the story, ironically, but in how you want to approach combat) that you might like in spite of the amount of running you do.  Suggest picking it up on a sale.			",226,10,2,21,11,0,33

 Currently at the time of reviewing this game it is on sale for $5 and all of its DLC $6. 	This game is definitely worth the price because of two reasons:1. The Combat2. The time it takes for completion  $5 = atleast 5 hours but in this case you get 200PROS +AMAZING COMBAT - Its combat is truly amazing it has great fluidity and just overall is extremly fun without getting boring. I just wish there were more skills for me to try.GRAPHICS - Although this game was released in 2012 its graphics still look good with a really colourful environment.OPENWORLD - Just a really nice touch for an rpg.LOOT - One thing that has always attracted me to rpg's is the loot/ special items you can find in them. KOA Reckoning does a phenominal job with having tons of  rare accessories, weapon and armor sets.TIME PLAYED - You can play this game for hours because of the sheer amount of quests and the size of its world.FACTIONS - You recieve special stuff when working with factions. The idea of factions is really cool and even though I like how you can work with all of them there isnt much story for them.REQUIREMENTS - Works great and doesnt require a top end gpu.CONS -STORY - Its story.... well all I can say is that it has one. The story is pretty lack luster and generic in my opinion and the npc's aren't really memorable either.CAMERA - You miss out on a lot of the beautiful environment because the camera angle is facing downwards on your character.RNG/BUGS - I've played through this game so many times looking for all armor sets but due to some unlucky bugs that make chests impossible to open I always quit halfway through due to frustration.BOSSES & Difficulty - The bosses in this game aren't really different from the monsters you fight regularily while playing through the game and the game itself is too easy even on the hardest difficulty._______________________________________________________________________________Overall this game is just great and  really fun to mess around in! I just wish that somehow, someway they can make a sequel to this game. ",14,1,0,3,1,0,0

												Don't let my low game hours fool you. I played this game for over 100 hours on my xbox before I wiped it.[Slight Spoilers]Pros:+This game lets you play whatever build you want to do.     -> Do you want to be a Mage and surprise people by slamming them to the ground with a massive warhammer? Do you want to play a Rogue who uses Daggers for assassinations but can hold her own in normal combat by wielding a Longsword? Do you want to play a Warrior who's only goal is to destroy people in insane combos with a sword that's twice their size? If you answered yes to any of these, please keep reading.    -> Each class has a set of weapons and armour associated with it, as well as abilities. A Rogue, for example, is built on skill points invested into Finesse and uses light/medium armour that gives bonus critical hit damage. Rogue weapons are the Bow, Daggers, and Faeblades. Their abilities are varied between sustaining mana to apply poison damage to all of their weapons to raining arrows from the sky.    -> The Warrior class is built on skill points invested into Brutality and can use Longswords, Greatswords, and Hammers with the heaviest armour that improves damage resistence and blocking ability. Their abilities vary from an adrenaline surge to deal massive damage when close to death to lifting all surrounding enemies into the air and slamming them all down.    -> The Mage class is built on skill points invested into Magic and can use Staves, Septres, and Chakrams with Robes for armour that help improve mana regeneration. Their abilities can vary from chaining lighting to summoning a meteor to crash down on enemies.+Gives the middle finger to restricted builds with the Destiny system.    -> You are not set to one way of playing the game. Just purchase a reset from a Fateweaver and suddenly, you can rebuild your character in their entirety! Go from a Mage in robes with a Staff and Septre to a hybrid Warrior/Rogue who uses a Hammer and Faeblades! (Keep in mind that there are many abilities to each class and you can do more than one class, or even all of them at once if you wanted. When you level up, read up on everything in your abilities tab and decide how the game should work for you.)+Super satisfying stealth gameplay.    -> Say you were spotted by a Jottun (a reverse Dwarf as I like to call them.) You can teleport through them, throw a smoke bomb down, jump on their back from stealth, and stab their neck to oblivion only to backflip off as you watch them bleed out. It's not just the massive enemies that are satisfying to stealth kill! You can sneak up on a Bandit and in quick succession you can trip them, making them land on their back only for your character to cover their mouth and stab their chest. The sneaking mechanic itself is a little bit wonky but oh my gosh it's still amazing to assassinate half of a Tuatha scout party and have the last few left♥♥♥♥♥♥talk you only to get torn to bits by open combat; speaking of which, my next point is close to this one.+Fluid combat system.    -> My favourite build was on my character named ""Lorabella."" She was a Warrior/Rogue hybrid that used a Longsword and Daggers. In the span of a minute, she can roll behind an enemy in stealth, backstab them, and immediately turn to the other enemies that spotted her afterwards. From here she can toss a smoke bomb or use an invisibility potion to get more stealth kills, or she can hold a weapon's attack (you can only equip two weapons at a time) and use the charge ability to launch herself at the nearest enemy, starting an attack combo which kills them quickly. After that, she can block with her shield at the right moment to deflect an enemy's attack and turn it into a combo to kill them quickly. I could go on and on about how many different ways you can play the same game and still be satisfied, but I will spare you from that.+Fateshifting.    -> In a tight spot? Too many enemies and you just want to go to the next area quickly? Want to get bonus XP for doing what you already do to kill enemies? Just do it™+Fast Travel!!!    -> Seriously who doesn't like this feature?Some cons: -The game can feel very repetitive.    -> Bandits, Fae, some Gnomes here and there, Jottun, Etten, Spiders, Kobolds, and so on. There's not much for diversity in enemies to face, some are just slightly different reskins of the base creature that does something different. See: Kobold Savages are Kobolds that throw their spears instead of try to poke you with them.    -> A lot of the game's quests are a variation of ""go here and kill these things for me"" and while the combat system is very fun, there's only so much that can be done before it feels like a chore. -Short story.    -> Excluding the time spent running to the new locations, the Faction quests as well as the main quests feel a little short compared to the size of the world given to the player.(Overall, I would say this game is absolutely worth buying. I haven't gotten to the DLCs yet though I do look forward to it! I hope this review helped!)-KEM			",84,13,0,19,13,0,26

												Fantastic game. It's pretty linear, but not in a bad way. Sidequests will fill your questlog as you pick them up every 10 feet or so if you explore a little. I think it took around 70 hours to finish the main quest and all the side stuff I could find. Combat took a little getting used to for me for some reason, but got the hang of it once I found a weapon style that I liked. Worth playing as this game goes on sale really cheap quite often.

												One of the most under rated RPGs of all time. The heart pounding, action based combat, with wonderful, rich skill animations. The MASSIVE open world, plethora of side quests, and truly astounding dlc. The story is full, decision driven, and breath taking. Truly a shame the company behind went bankrupt, as it is now unlikely we will see a sequel to this truly astounding game.			",150,10,1,22,3,0,13

												One of the first games I really really got into.This game is like Spec Ops: The Line. It is an underated master piece, very enjoyable.Played through the game all ways, brawn, brains and stealth. They are all fun. This is a very enjoyable game that you can sink many hours into accidentally. Really good gameOnly problem is the running around, unless you do what i do and fast travel heaps, it can take ages, i would of liked some mount kinda thing, a horse whatever, other wise brilliant game.

Posted: July 1, 2014
												I highly recommend this game. I have a hard time just trying to stop playing when i must!This game is a single player RPG in the likes of skyrim and fable. More like fable than skyrim actually because the choice you make in conversation change the way the world see you.Now where to start, mmmmm well the rpg element is very well done. You actually grow you character the way you like it. There are roughly 3 paths to put skill points in, warrior/rogue/sorcerer. You can put points anyway you want to. You can use any weapon and armor at first, then later on you need to have enough points in the proper class to use a weapon or armor. Still it leaves you with a loooooot of freedom in experimenting with the weapon you like. The questing is similar to what you've seen before, but it somehow is far more interesting. I don't know if it's the way it is written or what. Also, the npc are much more realistic than in any other rpg i've played. They make mistakes, they have goal, they are sad when something bad happen to the one they love. I think because when you talk to them, their lips actually move to the exact words they say make it more real somehow. But there are no animation in the faces for their emotion, which is ok i guess. We still have a way to go to make THAT happen in games. There is an overall story with a buttload of side quests and do it if you want quests where you're probably going to spend most of your time there, like i do. I come back to the main quest once in a blue moon!Professions: You got a boatload of professions: Alchemy, blacksmith, lockpicking/pickpocket, sagesmith, stealth, detect hidden, dispel aura, etc. With alchemy you can find more herbs in the field and blacksmith you can create customized weapons of all kind and armor. They are the most usefull profession, but they are not necessary to play the game. They also take more time and you get less gold with those. Eventually, it might be better to just sell everything you find and buy only the weapons and armor from the merchant. You get 1 new point to invest in profession each level. Also, for at least 2 professions, i found 2 trainers that asked for a lot of gold to raise your profession by 1 point.Battle: The battle is where you will spend the most time in. It's very well made. Very similar to Monster Hunter 3 on the wii and with similar weapons (The greatsword handle almost identically to monster hunter). As you put more skill points in your class, you will gain new moves with the weapon you put skill points in and it will also do a lot more damage. The weapons are: long sword, greatsword, great hammer, bow, fae blade, daggers, chakram, scepter, staff. Some are better for magician oriented individual, some are better for rogue and some are better for warriors, but honestly you can choose your fight style as you wish. Sometime you find a new weapon of a class that you never use, but it's sooooo much better than the one you use that you change (I'm particularly fond of greatsword, but now i'm weilding a freaking hammer!). Also, the neat thing is that you can equip 2 weapons at the same time and use any of the two at anytime in battle! This makes for amazing strategy.The battle itself is very fluid with lots of dodging, blocking and counter-attacks. The ennemy is pretty good, it encircle you most of the time and you have to deal with it. I play on normal level difficulty and i don't remember getting killed ever, but with the easy healing potions and mana, i guess its hard to die. Still, i got close a few times. I never get bored of the battle in this game, it's just THAT GOOD!Stealth: With daggers or fae blades equipped, you can try to do a silent kill on your opponent. You can only approach them when they turn their back on you and it's difficult unless you put some points into the stealth profession. You also need to put some points into backstabbing, because after a few levels, the ennemy won't go down with one hit anymore! I try to use it as much as i can, but honestly there aren't THAT many times that ennemies are showing me their back. Still, the backstabbing should be pretty usefull in battle against big monster that are slow to turn like trolls, golems and ettin. The daggers and fae blade do very fast attacks.Stealing: There are a lot of things to steal in this game. In fact, pretty much in every house. Getting caught can send you to prison or you can bribe your way through. Can be costly. Haven't explored that side of the game, too much honest i guess.Magic: There are spells that you can get by putting enough points in the sorcerer class. You can equip 4 abilities/spells at a time. They are almost all AWESOME. The first spell that you get is lightning bolt. At the moment, i got a freaking earthquake ability that actually show a big earthquake when i use it. I can use it 3 times in a row and the earthquake gets bigger and do more damage. It's fantastic! You can't spam spells tought. There is a small cooldown on each one, something like 3 seconds i think. Also, if you equip mage armor you get far more mana and mana regeneration which is important if you want to use spells often. They are costly. If that's your style of play, then scepters and staff are going to be your weapons of choice. Scepter shoot ranged fire/electricity/frost and staff is for close combat monsters. The staff animation is pretty awesome actually. Imagine that! A mage that is actually fun to play at close combat range too!The graphic are pretty good. The sound and music is good too. The world is vast and there is a looooooooooooot to explore. There are hidden things everywhere, so investing in the detect hidden profession for at least 2 points is pretty important. There is supposed to be hidden doors and i never even found one! But then my detect hidden prof is not high enough i guess. Oh by the way, this game play waaaaay better with a controller than a keyboard. The battle is just made for a controller. I wouldn't want to touch a keyboard for that. It's all in 3D.

												I am extremely impressed with this game, in spite of it's one major flaw which is that it can be easy to ""Overlevel"" your character quickly. I am somewhat disappointed that there is a level cap, unlike Skyrim, but I believe this could be remedied if any new DLC decided to scale enemies to the character's level, rather than hard lock them by regions explored. At that point, a level cap becomes moot, since enemies would always scale to the character's level and thus keep the challenge high (or at least higher than what is current.The game reminds me of Skyrim in it's use of combat and quests, but the story is deep and complex, and there are literally hours of exploration for those who take the time to do so.It is the story and the versatility of character development which really drew me in. The parallels to Skyrim are quite high, and I believe that Amalur actually was developed concurrently but released about eight months prior to that other great game.All in all, you cannot go wrong with this game. Especially at $20.00 or even lower during weekend or mid-week madness specials. (I picked up Amalur and all DLC content for $9.99 during one such special). It is easily work twice as much in terms of content and play time. (Heck, just look at my hours played! :) )If you haven't seen the hundred+ other positive reviews and decided to buy this one, the let this review be your impetus! BUY THIS GAME! It's awesome :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a game that is well known for its customization, while this is its most strong point, I would like to take the time to point out some of the other incredible things about this game.While the story is kind of lacking in tying into the Lore of the world of Amalur, it does a fantastic job of being a gripping story. You will grow to love each and every character that you meet in the storyline, but there are some you will grow to hate as well. The Voice-Acting is superb, but the level designs are very hit or miss, some landscapes are beautifully crafted and are visually stunning, but there are some that are very much so lacking in beauty and are very poorly designed, that you'll have to empty out your vomit bag after you clear the area. HOWEVER, this are minor setbacks compared to what this game can offer for only 19.99$, I personally rate it as an 8/10, with it also being one of my favorite games of all times.

I think it's underrated, I love fantasy RPGs and I can say I had loads of fun playing this game. I wont lie, it has a lot of thing that most RPG fans would hate but worth it in the end.

												Hello! Got the game last month and this game rocks because:...Big Openworld ...fast loadscreens ...a lot of different sidequest...for every quest different npcs with many, many variables of voices recordet. ...main quest is brilliant, exciting, and nice loot xD...many different weapons! every weapon feels different (tempo/attack combination . . . ) and != oh man they are stylish! got early in the game a longsword that looked similar to Froustmourne from WoW! o.O...the monsters are quite fun to fight and it get's rarely repeatable because you almost move on to then next location after a few tasks/quests . .  . ...you chan change your talents/skills (cheap) for ingame gold = you can play pure Mage/roque/warrior OR you play a combination of all or just hybrid of warrior/assasin= really simple system BUT a lot of fun.---------------------------------note for the end for my review:I have really, really old and lame pc and even so . . . the game works smooth, zero laggs/freezes and very fast loadscreens. For my personal opinion this game is absolutely underrated and even €20- is completely worth it.Especially if it's in sale like right now. The DLCs are really cool and just for 5 extra euro (total €10,--) also worth it.  MAD ",36,5,1,9,3,0,4

												The game feels like a more modern version of the first Fable game, and is really what they should have evolved into. The story is fairly straightforward, but does offer the player choices, and while many choices are one off events, your actions do change how NPCs at least talk to you or initiate conversations with you. The game does also have some interesting new fantasy ideas, like the Fae, an elf like race that lives by the stories they tell and are destined to repeat throughout their multiple lives.   Combat maintains a nice balance, with different playstyles being perfectly viable, and some fights will require preperation to have a fair chance of getting through them, but there's no major difficulty spikes. Basic crafting trees like alchemy and blacksmithing are included, and blacksmithing has a nice touch where you break down loot to make into other weapons and armor. The world is large and about as open as Oblivion, with only cities and dungeons having their own instances. And lastly, the graphics have a very WoW like feel to them, but far more technically advanced and nicer looking.			",168,17,1,18,9,0,10

												I loved this game! It was worth many hours of gameplay. Yes some of the tasks got a bit repetitive but the main story line was very fun. If I could say one thing about combat, it would be that there were too many spiders! And the cutscene for them gave me a heart attack every time, I swear I'm suprised my neighbors didn't give me a noise complaint with how loudly I cursed each time. Other than that, it was a very fun game and I highly recommend it if you'd like a mix of Skyrim and WOW.			",30,10,0,17,10,0,1

												I dunno why this game was not popular when it was released. And now im too afraid to ask. It was a great RPG emphasizing on character progression/skill progression, gameplay's quite the same as inquisition or can be considered as ARPG, even more gorgeously made, I love that assassin mage class ive been progressing on.Storywise, it was quite bland, and might be the one that should be done better. It was not captivating at all, first time i played, i strayed too far from the main quest, doing other trivial quests. While Skyrim did the same thing, but Skyrim entices people to do its main quest, giving players thuums and others, doing the main quest in KoA was not quite rewarding.The Art/Graphic/Drawing is beautiful! it is so beautiful i dont need to mention other things to sugarcoat it. Not a highend graphic, but beautifully drawn with its cartoonish but serious pictures.Overall, 8.5/10 Recommending this to RPG players who loves character/skill progression and gameplay rather than highend graphics.

												     This is a single player action RPG. (Kinda like Fable) Kingdoms of Amalur features five distinct regions and four playble races. Almain (Civilized Humans), the Dokkalfar (Dark Elves), the Ljosalfar (Light Elves), and the Varani (Nomadic Humans. The combat includes a 'Fate' system which allows the player to accumulate 'fate points' and enter Reckoning Mode. Which is a slow motion mode that allows you to quickly kill enemies and do brutal finishing moves. The world is very big and lots of side quest. No jumping which is kinda sad, (There is only predesignated spots to jump down from) but there is swimming and you can find some cool spots and side quests.  You have ability to buy homes and upgrade them (A lot like Fable) and you can communicate with , rob or kill NPCs. Which have their own consequences. In all this is a great Action RPG 9/10			",324,44,7,44,21,3,59

												I love this game a truly underestimated RPG that I discovered by just trying out the demo and a worthy purchase too because the full game has a lot to do with the extra DLC as well it definitely gives you over 100+ like most RPG's. But though the story can be a little confusing at times and especially some of the side quest stories it didn't stop me playing and just listening to everything, The world of KoA is very well thought out the forests at the start as vibrant and colourful to the plain barren deserts it's got just about everything, characters of the world are various from Faries to Thieves to Knights there's a lot of variety in the world. The voice acting is ok not the best but sometimes a game doesn't have to have the best voice acting to be enjoyable. But one thing that makes this game great is the combat system I found it fresh and seriously I never got bored in going into combat not once, because of the different style from swords, great swords, bows, daggers, faeblades and charkhams you can switch to many different styles on the fly because you can use 2 different weapons in battle for 1 button on your controller or mouse if you wish too. Fighting with a great sword to switch to a bow or faeblades to a Great sword is just cool in my book the game does has a stealth system so you can try a Stealth build if you wish in fact you can have a Stealth, Mage, Great Sword Tank or Sword build or a mixture of any it's that well thought out. Magic is also in the game you can use sceptres etc and have different kinds of magic like the usual fire, ice, thunder and poison to your weapons. Magic combat is ok it can be a little slow but again you can mix it up from a bow attack to ice or fire it's your choice to make it different, sceptres make magic a little better by adding charge moves in fact every weapon has unique moves sets that can be unlocked and you can add them into the attacks which makes it even more awesome when going into battle.The PC version does have a camera glitch were the FoV behind your character doesn't seem right in fact a little closer than it should be but there is a fix for it, I would recommend in getting the widescreen fixer mod,  this can be found in the guides section.I would also recommend playing the game on HARD mode from the start for a decent challenge it's not HARD but it gives a better experience.

												Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning succeeds in some important ways, but in my opinion inevitably falls flat on its face for anyone who has played RPGs before. It really depends on why you play RPGs.KoA has a story that is at times refreshing and inspired, like with almost everything surrounding the Fae and their interactions with your character.  At other times, it is cliche and groan-inducing; just about anything having to do with the ""Fate"" concept in the game was at best predictable and at worst actually insulting in its lameness. The dialogue outside of story missions was also trite and felt written around a quest that had already been programmed into the game without a justification. This is extra egregious in a game that advertises how a famous fantasy author developed the story.It has an art style that screams in vivid colors and exaggerated animations, which I personally love as a longtime ex-player of World of Warcraft. However, if you're a fan of dark and gritty, you won't really find it here. And honestly, most problematically, the game has a huge difficulty curve problem: it's way too easy. By halfway through the game, I had broken it even on ""hard"" difficulty. My warrior character, built in an extremely obvious fashion (and avoiding the bugged Last Stand talent), was nigh-invincible and two-shotting everything except bosses, and that's before stacking over 100% damage and several layers of mitigation in potions. The fundamental axis of interaction in KoA is combat; when it becomes so trivial as to be boring, the game falls apart unless you were happy playing on easy anyway.Overall, I really, really wish I could recommend KoA. . . but I think for most people that would read a Steam review, it's just not going to be the right choice.

												Of the many action-RPGs around these days, this is one of the more colorful.  Its idyllic fields, rocky heights, and stinking caves are very pretty, in a cartoonish sort of way.  So are the expressive NPCs, viscious beasts and so forth.  Of course, no game has an infinite array of palates and textures, so those stinking caves get very familiar, very quickly.Compensation for ""same-old-dungeon-itis"" comes from the combat system.  As you level up, you gain new combos you can use in different situations.  Different weapons gain different powers, and you have the freedom to use your skill points to get more than one weapon to maximum level if you want.  Experiment with saving, then using your skill points so you can reload if you don't like what you find a skill doing.  A sufficient number of upgradable magic powers and weapon skills keeps you moving from feral wolves to monolithic demons, with everything in between you'd expect from a fantasy game with any depth.  And this is one deep RPG.  Without trying, you're going to run into nine miles of lore.  If you don't like subtitles in your movies . . .85% - A couple small notes doesn't stop this RPGer from enjoying the RPG in this ARPG.			",123,70,1,42,7,0,24

												I really liked this game, huge world, pretty free roam, I think I missed a lot of this game and I pretty much went everywhere and tried to find as much as I can, as you can see by hours played, I played the crap out of this game. I had a blast, I didn't follow the story all that much really, just the main line, there is a lot of useless talking in this game and lore that I just didn't care about.Overall greatgame, combat is fun, good movement, camera can be a little wonky sometimes.  Lot's of varites of gear and classes that you can interchange.  I choose to be a straight up wizard on the final playthrough, I tried melee in this game as well, I actually liked the spell stuff a little more in this game, and I generally am not a fan of spellcasting in games.Like most games you could go crafting and potions and all that stuff, I always find that stuff to be a waste of time, but it's there if you want to do it.  I didn't really see a need since I generally found or bought or got good items as quest rewards or chests, if anything, lockpicking, wards where or more value than crafting to me in this game.Story main line I give it a 6 out of 10, same old line of you're the hero who's destiny no one can figure out.gameplay I give a 9 out of 10.so overall about an 8 out of 10 game, nicely done.

												     This is a single player action RPG. (Kinda like Fable) Kingdoms of Amalur features five distinct regions and four playble races. Almain (Civilized Humans), the Dokkalfar (Dark Elves), the Ljosalfar (Light Elves), and the Varani (Nomadic Humans. The combat includes a 'Fate' system which allows the player to accumulate 'fate points' and enter Reckoning Mode. Which is a slow motion mode that allows you to quickly kill enemies and do brutal finishing moves. The world is very big and lots of side quest. No jumping which is kinda sad, (There is only predesignated spots to jump down from) but there is swimming and you can find some cool spots and side quests.  You have ability to buy homes and upgrade them (A lot like Fable) and you can communicate with , rob or kill NPCs. Which have their own consequences. In all this is a great Action RPG 9/10			",324,44,7,44,21,3,59

												I dunno why this game was not popular when it was released. And now im too afraid to ask. It was a great RPG emphasizing on character progression/skill progression, gameplay's quite the same as inquisition or can be considered as ARPG, even more gorgeously made, I love that assassin mage class ive been progressing on.Storywise, it was quite bland, and might be the one that should be done better. It was not captivating at all, first time i played, i strayed too far from the main quest, doing other trivial quests. While Skyrim did the same thing, but Skyrim entices people to do its main quest, giving players thuums and others, doing the main quest in KoA was not quite rewarding.The Art/Graphic/Drawing is beautiful! it is so beautiful i dont need to mention other things to sugarcoat it. Not a highend graphic, but beautifully drawn with its cartoonish but serious pictures.Overall, 8.5/10 Recommending this to RPG players who loves character/skill progression and gameplay rather than highend graphics.

												I love this game a truly underestimated RPG that I discovered by just trying out the demo and a worthy purchase too because the full game has a lot to do with the extra DLC as well it definitely gives you over 100+ like most RPG's. But though the story can be a little confusing at times and especially some of the side quest stories it didn't stop me playing and just listening to everything, The world of KoA is very well thought out the forests at the start as vibrant and colourful to the plain barren deserts it's got just about everything, characters of the world are various from Faries to Thieves to Knights there's a lot of variety in the world. The voice acting is ok not the best but sometimes a game doesn't have to have the best voice acting to be enjoyable. But one thing that makes this game great is the combat system I found it fresh and seriously I never got bored in going into combat not once, because of the different style from swords, great swords, bows, daggers, faeblades and charkhams you can switch to many different styles on the fly because you can use 2 different weapons in battle for 1 button on your controller or mouse if you wish too. Fighting with a great sword to switch to a bow or faeblades to a Great sword is just cool in my book the game does has a stealth system so you can try a Stealth build if you wish in fact you can have a Stealth, Mage, Great Sword Tank or Sword build or a mixture of any it's that well thought out. Magic is also in the game you can use sceptres etc and have different kinds of magic like the usual fire, ice, thunder and poison to your weapons. Magic combat is ok it can be a little slow but again you can mix it up from a bow attack to ice or fire it's your choice to make it different, sceptres make magic a little better by adding charge moves in fact every weapon has unique moves sets that can be unlocked and you can add them into the attacks which makes it even more awesome when going into battle.The PC version does have a camera glitch were the FoV behind your character doesn't seem right in fact a little closer than it should be but there is a fix for it, I would recommend in getting the widescreen fixer mod,  this can be found in the guides section.I would also recommend playing the game on HARD mode from the start for a decent challenge it's not HARD but it gives a better experience.

												Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning succeeds in some important ways, but in my opinion inevitably falls flat on its face for anyone who has played RPGs before. It really depends on why you play RPGs.KoA has a story that is at times refreshing and inspired, like with almost everything surrounding the Fae and their interactions with your character.  At other times, it is cliche and groan-inducing; just about anything having to do with the ""Fate"" concept in the game was at best predictable and at worst actually insulting in its lameness. The dialogue outside of story missions was also trite and felt written around a quest that had already been programmed into the game without a justification. This is extra egregious in a game that advertises how a famous fantasy author developed the story.It has an art style that screams in vivid colors and exaggerated animations, which I personally love as a longtime ex-player of World of Warcraft. However, if you're a fan of dark and gritty, you won't really find it here. And honestly, most problematically, the game has a huge difficulty curve problem: it's way too easy. By halfway through the game, I had broken it even on ""hard"" difficulty. My warrior character, built in an extremely obvious fashion (and avoiding the bugged Last Stand talent), was nigh-invincible and two-shotting everything except bosses, and that's before stacking over 100% damage and several layers of mitigation in potions. The fundamental axis of interaction in KoA is combat; when it becomes so trivial as to be boring, the game falls apart unless you were happy playing on easy anyway.Overall, I really, really wish I could recommend KoA. . . but I think for most people that would read a Steam review, it's just not going to be the right choice.

												So bad, but so good. The story, characters, and lore of the game are at best forgettable, and at worst utterly nonsensical and irritating. The questing is SO BORING, almost everything is copy pasted with SLIGHT changes in who you get to face smash. The enemy variety is quite low, I don't think there are more than 15 different enemies that fight uniquely outside of the bosses, most of the enemy variety are just skin changes with better stats. The NPCs are very bland and uninteresting. Also, I don't know if it was just me, dispelling was super bugged. I literally could not unlock spelled containers with the dispelling game because it was so bugged, I had to crank dispelling so I could auto-unlock them.On the other hand, the combat is SO GOOD. Admittedly, their archery doesn't make a lot of sense(THATS NOT HOW QUIVER WORK) but it is still really fun. You get magic, archery, and melee talent trees with different special abilities liberally sprinkled throughout (including Scorpion's signature move). The weapon augment system is kind of interesting, unless you get and finish the Legend of Dead Kel expansion and then you can just use your diplomat to farm the best augments and call it GG.Overall, I would only lightly recommend this if you are looking for a good hack and slash game.6/10 would Fate Shift that lone Boggart again.

												Lost interest in this game quickly because of the frustration of how quickly mobs respawned in the zones, it made exploring tedious as groups of monsters you've killed respawn at the frequency of an MMO, giving no sense of accomplishment as you run back through a zone you've already cleared.However, the combat was immensly fun, the characters were interesting and the story was engaging, particularly the side-quests. I would recommend this game, but only if you enjoy combat that's difficult to avoid and you have a lot of time to sink into it, because you'll have a hard time if you just want to focus on the main story-line.

												KoA is going to be remembered not for the game, but for the complete collapse of the studio and the fallout from that. Which is a shame, because KoA is a decent game. Right away I'd like to point out, it's essentially Fable + MMO, all single player. Combat is generally quick and easy, quests are your standard fetch and kill fare, and the world is generic high fantasy. That said, it's also lovingly crafted and just flat out fun to play. Even on the hardest setting the game is easy, and as quick as I am to decry games being dumbed down, it can be incredibly satisfying at times to just tear through hordes of enemies. The skill system has some decent depth to it, as does the gear. The world is beautiful and the sound design is solid. The game can feel grindy, again, it's basically a single player MMO, but it's also fun if you're into that sort of thing. If nothing else, pick it up cheap for some awesome chakram action.

												Sadly Kingdoms Of Amalur: Reckoning kinda flew under the radar for allot of people until the reviews started popping up. This was mainly because of the terrible advertising that made this brilliant game come across as mediocre. To put KOAR simply it’s a Fable-like MMO style action RPG with rich lore, unique creature designs, an interesting story & faction stories & a brilliant character development system that encourages multi-classing. A little FYI a Ranger type Rouge with defensive & buff Mage skills is pretty much unbeatable. It’s a very colourful game which is a nice change from the very dull & dark designs of most games today & if you are OCD about exploration & completing every side quest this is a game that’ll take quite a while to complete, I have not even finished it yet & as of this recommendation I have stacked up about 103 hours of game time. I recommend this to all fans of RPGs, exploration & a good story & I hope to see more from this franchise in time to come.			",201,42,0,65,15,3,17

												Since I am bored at work And I'm tired of viewing screenshots from my friends, I decided to just review pretty much all the games I own ;D Yes... I am that bored...Alright then, Kingdoms of Amalur:Reckoning is an RPG single player only, while you play you will get the feeling that since the world is so expansive, filled with life and Npc's it should have had an online mode or it should have been a FREE Online game.To Describe this game in few words they would be: Immersive World, Quests, Magic, Fate, Medieval Style, Monsters and Hitting deers into space.Ok, with that being sed you can picture what the game is like!Let's start with the story, I was hyped about this game I remember seeing the trailers, how it had a guy who worked on the story of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, so the game showed great promise.The game starts with the Story of the World, what's going on and HOW YOU DIED in the War the people of Amalur fought.You wake up in a pile of decaying corpses and make your way up from underground to the Tower, you then realize that the tower is under attack by the Tuatha Dehon ( The bad guys) who are immortal.As you go along you discover that you were revived by the well of souls and hence forth you are sent from quest to quest to find out what's going on.The story telling in this game is average, the story itself is also average but the best by far in this game is the Combat System, fighting multiple units at once, with a fast paced system ranging from Bow, Hammer, Sword, Great Swords, Wands and the longer Wands XD. One of the best features in this game is The Fate power you get early on, which allows you to slow down Time and beat the crap out of your enemies and finish them off with an Epic and Awesome animations.Since you died and were revived, you can now change your fate and that of those around you. Example: By killing the Monster X they will not have the children X they were supposed to have. That enables to player to change the world around him.The Side quests are repetitive and meh, The Devs sed that to complete the game fully it would take about 300 hours. I object to that! I am 50 something hours in and and I have done every boring and repetitive side quest there is to do, and I'm almost done with it. :)There are also interesting and vast Faction Quest Lines with alternate endings but in the End they just get repetitive as the side quests do.I get the feeling that this game could have been more than what it was, too bad the company went broke from debt but there is still hope for the KOA Trade mark!! Also a pretty huge part in this game is that, IT IS TOO EASY!! you'll realize this like 2-3 hours in, you destroy everything in your way pretty much without dying. I can even challenge myself into Not even dying once while playing through this entire game.Thanks to the modding community there is a mod out there that makes the game harder to beat.You can also craft armor, The skill system is quite vast, and there should have been Mounts in this game, I got tired of walking after a while.And there you have it, my review for Kingdoms of Amalur:Reckoning if you are a person that loves RPG like I do you'll get over the fact that it's single player online and immerse yourself in the mythos like I did.

												This game is very under appreciated. I love this game, it's absolutely fantastic and any RPGer should get it. The main questline and the faction quests are the best parts and most interesting things about this game, and I especially love how completing some of the faction questlines will bring up interesting dialogue.The thing I really love about this game is the fact that it's an adventure RPG with action oriented combat. That was the big reason for me buying this, and although the combat is sometimes finicky, I was not disappointed. A gem amongst so much RPG trash.			",63,29,1,19,13,0,19

												There’s a game you probably didn’t play. It came out 2 years ago, it’s a genuine epic, a vast, elaborate RPG with a sprawling story and vast numbers of sidequests. It features superbly in-depth combat, has huge variety in character design and levelling, and lets you instantly wander from the main plot and explore its enormous world to your own entertainment. It’s Kingdoms Of Amalur: Reckoning. By John Walker			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Big Huge Games’s recent multiplatform ARPG release Kingdoms of Amalur writes a pretty big check by boldly laying out the names of its creative team, which includes such nerd luminaries as Todd McFarlane (of Spider-Man and Spawn fame) and R.A. Salvatore (if you’ve never read a Salvatore book or heard of Drizzt Do’Urden, you may not actually be a geek)–a check which does not bounce.A number of narrative elements in this game are generic fantasy and CRPG tropes: the nameless hero with no memory of his past, the racial groups (blank-slate humans, noble elves, mysterious dark elves, and clever but clumsy and often scatterbrained gnomes), the world-imperiling threat that only your hero can defeat. It’s the way these things are packaged that makes the game better than the sum of its parts. You begin as a recently-deceased individual on a corpse pile and you quickly learn that you are the first and only success of a group of gnome scholars attempting to master the science of resurrecting the dead. Your “undead” status also has an additional benefit: in a world where all creatures are bound to a web of Fate and their lives and deaths are predestined, you have no written fate and you can influence the fates of others. Your recollection of your previous life is non-existent but two NPCs, a human fateweaver (a person who uses cards to “read” the fates of others) and former soldier named Agarth and a beautiful and cryptic Dokkalfar (dark-elven) rogue named Alyn Shir, guide you on a journey to assist the free peoples of Amalur in defeating the Tuatha, a race of immortals bent on destroying all mortal life with the aid of their new god, Tirnoch.Combat in KoA starts out quite Diablo-like, but once you invest some points in special attack skills with your weapon of choice, it gets much better. As shown in the image above, you have a primary weapon, mapped to the left mouse button, and a set of spells or special moves selected by using the number keys and triggered with the right mouse button. You also assign a secondary weapon and can rapidly switch between them using the mousewheel. Dodging is accomplished by using the WASD keys in conjunction with the spacebar. Weapons range from very fast melee (daggers and faeblades) to slow melee (greatswords) and ranged (longbow). Combining movement, weapon attacks, and spell-like abilities in a fluid way makes for a fast-paced and generally enjoyable experience. Probably the biggest issue with the system is that the game will automatically retarget the last enemy to strike your avatar, which can be a nuisance if you’re attacking a particular enemy (spellcaster or really tough opponent) on purpose.Levelling up grants you a bonus to health and mana pools, along with one point to allocate toward a skill as well as three points to invest in abilities. Skills include lockpicking, dispelling, stealth, persuasion,  detect hidden,  mercantile, blacksmithing, sagecraft,  and alchemy. The latter three skills are tied to the game’s crafting system, which I’ll discuss a bit later. Dispelling is essentially a kind of magical lockpicking. Both skills are linked to minigames that allow the player to open containers found throughout the gameworld, but lockpicking is much less useful as the minigame really requires some trial-and-error but nothing in the way of user skill. Personally, I never could get the hang of the ward-dispelling minigame so I tended to ignore warded chests (these have a violet glow). Detect hidden allows you to “find” more gold on the bodies of dead enemies and on rare occasions will provide you with additional dialogue options.Crafting is bog-standard for the genre, with potion-mixing (alchemy), gem creation for socketed equipment (sagecraft), and weapon- and armor-creation (blacksmithing). Having more skillpoints in the related areas allows the player to create better gear, gems, or potions. This is not the sort of thing I usually spend a lot of time fiddling with in my role-playing games, but I would definitely recommend blacksmithing over the other two skills on the basis of my playthrough. This is partly because the loot system is pretty awful. Aside from starting equipment, I used only a few different pieces or sets of armor and only five or six different weapons throughout the game. For the length of my roughly 70-hour playthrough, I encountered zero arms or armor with sockets that will accept the highest craftable tier of gems, making my investment of points in that skill rather meaningless. The equipment drops you find in containers and from looting corpses are very rarely better than what you are using; store inventories are also rarely worth purchasing, so the best gear you’ll find are quest rewards and items crafted from scratch (and for those you must invest in blacksmithing).Pathfinding is pretty easy, thanks to a useful minimap and world and local map screens. Your avatar’s level of detect hidden will determine what items besides NPCs and towns appear on the maps (including, curiously, enemies), and upgrading your detect hidden skill will allow you to see enemy facing directions, treasures, traps, and lorestones. Lorestones are KoA‘s collectibles, stone monuments with magically-recorded bits of lore about the area in which they are found; locating and activating all of the stones in a set provides you with a small bonus such as +4% health.Throughout the course of the game, you will acquire several personal houses which contain a handy “stash” chest that can hold 155 items. Having multiple houses is actually a bit pointless as the fast-travel system is sufficiently well-implemented that you can easily jump to your first acquired property at Canneroc from anywhere else on the map and back again with a few clicks.This brings us to the questing. Put simply Kingdoms of Amalur and Skyrim are the two games that had some people questioning whether there can indeed be too much of a good thing, like these people and this site. Playing through every side quest KoA has to offer and hunting down every lorestone in addition to the main quest will probably clock in around 90 – 100 hours. Almost every NPC you meet will have at least one quest for you to do for him/her, and while many are typical FedEx or “Kill X of Monster” quests, some are unique and interesting and all of them include well-written backstories. There are six different factions to complete quest chains for (I only did five) and these are very detailed and lengthy endeavors. Some critics have questioned how memorable the story is, but I suggest that this has more to do with the nigh-overwhelming number of side quests present in the game than any flaw in the writing of the main storyline.On the whole I think Big Huge’s first foray into the RPG arena is a successful one, and I would be interested in seeing whether the developer is going to push the series forward with more single-player entries before the inevitable MMO iteration appears on the market.

												20 hours on record now and not disapointed. If you like a RPG game with a deep lore, love maximising your char (even overpowered maybe), then this is your game.Pro:-This game rewards you if you tend to stay and upgrade a bit (sidequest, explore/exploit game mechanics) before going to the next area. Doing some research in the fighting mechanics will pay off, same for searching for clues how to maximise your char early on. -This game doesn't punish you for being intelligent and leaves the balance (and thus difficulty) in your hands.-Decent graphics.-Deep storyline. Troughout the world you get to know the lore even better with lorestones and sidequests.-Upgrade your char. A lot. With good (but not game changing) upgrades.-Change your character to another playstyle anytime you want. (This ability is very well integrated in the storyline: it is there for a reason. Thumbs up for the writers!)-Fast travel.-Many unique items. Item sets. All with unique abilities not found on equal 'normal' items.Con:-Content is repeated a lot. Especially the indoor environment build system is flawed.-Combat is a bit thin. Just get a big mana regen or health regen and change weapons often. On the contrary, don't get that regen / upgrade and you experience a steep difficulty increase.-Repeating sidequests. Fetch this, kill that.-Crafting is there but no need for it. Just buy/find another better item. ",163,16,1,13,30,0,24

												I really wish Steam had a ""maybe"" recommendation, because this game fits into that. I usually give RPGs about 10 hours to get me hooked, and I gave this one 20 because I heard the story was great and compelling but the story didn't go anywhere during the 20 hours I played. If I hear ""you have to put 40 in to like it"" then I say go play an MMO if you're into that.Overall, the combat is fun. I really liked it, but that might be because you never actually get to use it. You get some new gear and upgrade a few skill points and you're 1-hitting anything your level. Bosses are challenging, until you go into the superpower mode and kill each and every one. Quests aren't very compelling and the talking goes on forever without much reason for me to care about anybody. Not only that but one of the DLC's storylines about giants, which I was interested in, had a glitch that prevented me from finishing it without restarting completely. Awesome.The graphics are cool and you know what, I wish this game had multiplayer. If it had 2 or even 4 player co-op, it would be awesome. I would have so much fun playing with other people, but the lack of enemies to kill, lack of cares I give, and lack of anything interesting in almost a day playing makes it where I don't feel happy recommending this game.

												A fairly unsung RPG in its own right, not sure what I haven't heard that much about it. Nabbed it, plus the DLC during a major sale, getting it all for 10$ though it's certainly worth the full price of admission as this will take ~40 hours or more of your time.The game feels like a mix of Fable and the earlier Bioware games such as Mass Effect, Jade Empire, and Knights of the Old republic, though it's a shinier variant of all of those. It has the aesthetic and music of Fable but with a Bioware-esque RPG mixture.It's not a complicated game to be sure. The dialog doesn't affect much of what you do and there are no companions to fiddle around with.I'd certainly recommend it, especially if you're a fan of all the other games listed and have played the rest of them to death. This will be refreshing.			",210,36,0,38,30,0,21

However, it is nevertheless an engaging RPG well worth playing. I would not pay full-price for it so wait till it goes on sale but this is definitely a fun RPG to play on a slow day. What gives the game quite a bit more variety is the class structure...the story provides a justification for respeccing your character at any time and you can make any combination of the classic warrior-mage-sneak trifecta of RPG roles.

												Played and completed the game twice. Yes, that's how much I loved it! A very underrated game indeed... Great gameplay with a really fun combat and leveling system. You don't always come across RPGs like this everytime. I would definitely recommend this game to RPG lovers any day and even if you're not into RPGs it would still be worth giving it a try. I'm sure you won't regret it.    Pros:> Gameplay is fun> Combat and leveling systems are pretty good> Story is pretty decent if not that great> Decent graphics and runnable on even low-spec PCs> Dialogs and character voices are good> Loads of quests and other side quests to complete so you don't have to worry about completing the game quickly   Cons (not major and might not even matter for some):> Because of the huge number of side quests and free farming of exp by killing enemies in the wild you level up pretty quickly and you will have a pretty much overpowered character after some time... so, people who are looking for a little challenge might be a little disappointed with that. But the combat is still fun none-the-less and you won't get bored easily.> You get to select what your character will say or do during decision-making events but your character doesn't have a voice of his own. (Like in games like The Elder Scrolls)Lastly, there's no such action as 'jump' in this game (Like in The Witcher games) so, if you want to maybe get down a cliff quickly you'll have to go to a specific spot on that cliff that lets you jump down from it. It isn't exactly a con because the game mechanics are designed that way. However, you do have actions like 'roll' and 'blink' (short distance teleportation) that allow you to dodge enemy attacks. And that's one of the reasons that makes the combat fun aside from the ton of spells and other cool abilities and combos you have access to.			",118,21,2,21,7,0,4

												Fair warning: tall wall of text below.I think if KoA was released an year before it's actual appearance, this game would become way more popular. It was flattened by stronger contenders, such as Skyrim, and didn't get enough recognition. Which, in my opinion, is unfair. This game deserves some love, because it is really well made.The world is open and very large. It has many secrets to share. It's easy to get lost. But you don't get that ""Bring me back"" feeling, it is an experience - to explore new lands and watch out for new enemies and loot. NPCs are ranging from standart ""good guys"" and confusing, but adorable, midgets to psychos and evil mages with robes and whatever goes with typical villain appearance. Unfortunately, almost none of the are remarkable. You will often hear voice of the same person when speaking to NPCs in literally same exact location. Base models are quite often reused too. Slightly damages overall atmosphere of ""everything new and unusual"".Quests are fun. Sometimes. Boring ""go-there-and-speak-to-this-person-then-speak-to-other-person"" quests are rare, but you will eventually stumble upon those. But even they always come with a twist. Speak to these four persons and find out how to place them in a column, so they won't kill each other, please. Quests are more like little adventrues, that will take you to the unexplored dungeons and cryptic castles (most of which would look exactly the same for you, but don't bother). All of them have stories behind them, but they seem rather... irrelevant. You don't feel the impact of your actions. You just helped that man, who claims to be the wolf, turned into humanoid by evil fairies. Now he thanks you and bids farewell. You will never see him again. And soon enough you will forget about him. Really rarely you get to see what have you done to others. Game simply erases it form the memory. The only reminder of that will calmly sit in your quest book. Strikethrough.The combat on the other hand is developed amazingly. Strikes chain into beautiful combos, combos then develop into cascades of hits and then finishing blow. Rinse, repeat. Never mind that your character will do the same moves over and over. You will never get tired of them. There are tons of weapon types and all of them have their unique move sets. Not all of them will be unlocked at the beginning; it will take few levels and some skill points investments to unlock new attacks. Mixing them with generic weapon attacks will result in gorgeous sights and dead enemies. Charge the key and then... maelstrom of blades or magic envelops you. Truly amusing. You also can kill any NPC that you don't like, ransack a wardrobe only to find peasant's tunic in here, pickpocket someone for sweet cash. Of course it comes with punishment. Of course local guards will try to stop you. And then you have a choice to bribe them, run away or go to prison like a good person (and then escape one moment later, brutally murdering everyone who stands on your way). Game doesn't stop you from being bad guy. You have your own path to follow, there is no set road. And I like it. And some quests actually reward that. So prepare your quick fingers, as a lot of stuff will stick to them quite soon.Graphics are what you expect from 2011 game. Yes. they are not great, yes, they are cartoonish. But then you see a landscape and you finger automatically reaches the F12 button. Not always you will get breathtaking views, but when you do, you will be pleased. Architecture also deserves special mention. Sometimes reminds me of Warcraft, sometimes of Oblivion, other times feels like you were thrown into Witcher. There are many wonderful places, some of them will make you spend time simply staring on puzzling ornament on a wall, while you're being pursued by swarm of spiders. When it comes to NPCs. Most of them are bricky and not looking like someone who can breathe. But on the other hand, when you get used to it, you will skip this part and go straight sor details. And some persons you'll meet look really great. Maybe it's haircut, tattoos or eyes, or even mix of three at the same time, they catch your attention with their features.I enjoyed this game. My only real complaint is that inventory is so small. Picking up everything and the selling it to vendor anyway is, like, my favourite way to play RPG. But seriously, if you want to create your own character and be unbound, be yourself basically; you are not becoming sick after seeing ""video-game graphics"" and you are not playing any other RPG for some reason - you will enjoy it. The price is relatively low as well, on a sale it becomes nearly free. And good luck, Child of Dust.			",29,8,0,24,1,0,10

It's a damn shame 38 studios isn't a thing anymore tl;dr Hack&Slash RPG that is 100% worth your money if you want a time sink and a decent story set in a visually outstanding world. Stumbled upon this gem a while back. Fantastic time sink for anyone looking to lose hours of their day in a sytlistically dissimilar game.It's a Hack&Slash RPG. This means that for those who like to fawn over the mechanics of combat in other RPGs, you may find some issues with this game. After a few hours, repitition does rear its' head if you only tend to play one type of the 3 main RPG classes (Spells and pointy hat, quick with a small stick and slow with a big stick).That being said, the game rewards you immensely for spending skill points in all of the 3 main skill trees and usingthe varied types of weapons. Some of the attacks you can pull off with well timed spells after ranged/melee combos are simply outstanding.Story doesn't usually rank highly on my list of things I think NEED to be good for a game to be good but it certainly helps, especially in an RPG. The main quest in Reckoning will send you all over the place in stages, typical to any modern fantasy title. It takes you on a monumental adventure, eventually taking on an enemy no one had a damn clue existed and saving the day etc. good stuff all around.It's in my personal opinion that ending was a bit weak and that it lets down the story as a whole. Rather than bundle up everything, it sort of hangs loose. This may have been due to a desire to create a sequel.Nitpicking for those super into game mechanics i.e. CONS GO HEREThe world itself looks outstanding, however the only real issue I had with this entire game was the lack of ANY major verticality. The world is by no means planar, but the only transition between up, middle and down was if you interacted with the world to perform a jump into a roll landing from up above OR the world slopes down/up to meet the next area. Even if the height difference is an inch, you can't simply step up to that height. While released in 2012, the game has aged fairly well. Would absolutely recommend if it comes up in your Summer Steam sale or a normal purchase if you're simply looking for a solid game.			",87,1,1,9,3,1,5

												Definitely a must  buy game for all the ones look for a RPG and Open world game. I can honestly say buying the entire package for 10$ is the best I've ever spent my money. That's not to say the game is perfect though.Cons (after stating that the game is an absolute must-buy)-a little difficult to fight enemies on a hill (chakrams just go through the hill and not uptowards the enemy)-No legendary armor :/ -Complete armor sets are hard to come by unless given to you all at once.- Not many houses in each village, about 3 per town that actually have shops.-Not a big deal, but NPC's will wait to stand all the way up to talk to you (I.E. you have to wait for NPC to sit all the way down and then back up)-Lorestones can often conflict with quest dialogue especially at the end....

												An enjoyable, 3rd person, action RPG.+ The voice actors did a good job.+ The writers did even better - NPC dialogues are wonderful. Metaphores, philosophy of life/death cycle, contemplation.+ Story idea is refreshing, it is as if there is a static story from a book, but then the strange element or ""you"" is thrown in it. And, maybe you are not the only ""dynamic"" power in the book's story...+ Nice combat with easy controls, with a bit of playing around you can combo things up.+ Big game world, playthrough can be lengthy if you like to sidetrack.- The world might seem a bit MMO-ish (but that is only because of our perception of things). Good part is, nobody can stop you from running to some dangerous areas of the game right from the start.- Too much eye candy - turn off post processing and enjoy the game.~ If you are a person that skips every NPC dialogue and ""rushes"", you will find the game dull.~ Recommended to play on Hard.

												Not a great rpg but also not a bad one. Runs smoother than any game I've ever owned and the combat is fun but the game does quickly get very repetitive. I would play it more but it just got so old and boring I couldn't stand to finish it. It is hard to pinpoint why it is so boring, it just is. Probably mainly because of the combat getting old fast.The baseball player Curt Schilling who I saw play quite often when I was younger financed the company that made this game and this was the only game they made. They ended up going bankrupt and shutting down after not being able to pay back loans to the state of Rhode Island. Too bad for him they couldn't have had a lot more polish on this game.Game has good graphics which along with combat are its high points. I would not exactly say the graphics are great because they are not, and are not bad either, just colorful and pretty. Weapons are cool and the spells/skills look great, however few skills there are, and enemies are varied and cool also. For sure worth a look if you want a decent RPG. If you want crack, heroin, and a BJ/HJ combo, talk to Josh Holmes' sister. She has spent more time on her back than a mattress salesman with alcoholism and narcolepsy.6.5/10			",598,87,12,48,22,5,43

												I wouldnt call this game bad, but not good either. Its an rpg that lets you skill what you want, in  3 skill trees. Missions are always the same, ala kill this or bring this, or collect this and that, but mostly they have somekind like a story or a background, and some of them are really interestening. The fighting system is quick, fast and based on blocking or dodging. It needs a bit of balance, since i think this game is too easy, and only enemys with much life are annoying because you need really much time to kill them even tough they dont give a threat. But the atmosphere, is fantastic. It looks like in a (bloody) fairy world. R.A Salvatore, made a interestening story,also reminds me some of the dragonworld saga from him. The repetetive missions and gameplay(you come into a new place, there is somewhat a problem, you solve it , or not, and advance further ) is the only thing i dont like about the game thats why its just an ""okay"" game.5/10			",232,45,3,57,11,2,36

												I'm not much of one for writing reviews; I don't do it often, and have no practice at it. But, what I can say here, is that for years I've been looking for a game that's centered primarily, if not wholly, around Celtic mythology, rather than generic European medieval fantasy or feudal Asian mythology. This game delivered, moreso than I could have ever thought a game could. Why there haven't been more games featuring such strong Celtic themes is beyond me, but Kingdoms of Amalur: Recokoning showed that it can be done, and done very well. I was definitely impressed with the story of the game.As far as gameplay, things were pretty good. Combat and controls felt better with a gamepad than mouse and keyboard, but that's never been a dealbreaker for me. I feel there could have been more done with combos and chaining attacks, because combat felt a little static after awhile, but it wasn't awful. Most quests(but not all; here's looking at you, Til's Collection) were interesting and often felt like an interesting task, rather than a chore to do for XP. The main quest line especially was fun, interesting, and kept me pulled in to the game. Factions you could join in the game I felt were pretty mediocre, and are your generic warriors, mages, and rogues factions. Their quests were fun, but I never really felt like my character truely belonged to the faction upon joining. The one major downside I felt in the game was gear drops. Almost always, what you can craft at each level was better than anything you could find, even rare named pieces or sets. As for the DLC, Teeth of Narros had a fun main story line, but for the most part it felt drawn out and monotonous. The side quests were pretty boring, and involved a lot of backtracking. Legend of Dead Kell was much better, and felt more involved.One more note: This game is LONG. And I really mean long, especially if you are a completionist and want to do all of the side quests.

It's definitely a game worth buying, but sadly it has couple of big flaws in it.Well, firstly the good things;+ It has a pretty interensting storyline, you can get kinda lost and bored at some point, but it's still OK.+ The combat system is flawless, THE BEST I've had in any RPG ever. + Very cool skillset that you can acquire as you level up, especially the sorcery skills look absolutely amazing. Basically there's 3 different trees that you can choose; Finesse, Might and Sorcery, but you can actually also combine these together to go with a hybrid build as for example Finesse/Sorcery and get skills from both trees.+ TONS of quests to do, I can take a guess that it takes about 150+ hours to run through them all?+ A lot of unique weapons and armor sets, always keeps you looting everything throughout the whole game.+ It has the perfect open world, it's large and free, but still it doesn't take half a year to travel trough.+ Decent amount of different enemies, but this also has it flaws.+ Stealth is an (overpowered) option.+ Crafting, Sagecrafting, Alchemy.+ Nice graphics and overall visuals.+ Very enjoyable DLC.As for the negative ones, there is a couple of them;- The game has a lot of bugs and glitches, and couple of them are absolutely game breaking. The most infamous one is probably the ''running bug'' which usually occurs after around 60+ hours of gameplay. It freezes the game always when you are running forward for about a second, every 5 seconds or so. In my understanding there's no way to fix this bug apart from starting a fresh game.- I don't like the level lock in this game, it ruins some areas for you if you enter them too early in the game. Basically it means, if you enter a new area for example at level 5, the enemies and loot in that area will remain at level 5 for the entire game. That makes you always be very careful about progressing through the quests and it's really annoying.- After a while when you get most of the skills in your build of choosing, the game becomes VERY easy. Most of the enemies won't stand a chance against you, few minibosses and bosses excluded.If you combine potions, overpowered gear and ''Fateshift'', you will basically become the supreme God of death and destruction, and just absolutely wreck everything on sight. If you want the most out of your experince in this game, avoid using potions and fateshift.- And a little bit more about the overpowered things, the crafting in this game is kinda broken.It's relatively easy to gather some beastly crafting materials, and after you get your skills high enough to do mastercrafted gear, they are just absolutely disgustingly good. Better than any of the armor sets or unique weapons. I personally avoid crafting just because of that, and suggest you to do the same.- Very repetitive dungeons. A lot of them seem to share the same layout, just with different monsters and quests.- This isn't that big of a flaw, but anyways, some of the bosses also share the same models. For example the ''Widow'' is just another fae with different colors, which was very dissapointing.- Backpack size is way too small for all the drops in the game, items stack in sizes of 10, which also limits the items you can take with you.- I'm actually not quite sure about this, but I think the max level of weapons are like 12-13 or something like that? It's kinda weird since the level cap is at around 40, but you can't actually get any weapons at that level.Overall though, I can recommend to buy this game if you already haven't since it's content will be worth the 20€ + DLC. Very unique combat system and all the other things combined makes this a solid 8/10, despite some of it's flaws. ",36,3,1,3,1,0,0

												First, you CAN NOT play this with an Xbox One Controller. In the current era of changes by MS, cross your fingers with any game. Some games only runs on Win 10, some only on Win 7 64 bit, some are incompatible with Win 7 64 and now a new issue regarding controller conflict. I hate change, because big business does not care about you.  I do wish Steam would at least add a warning o their store page. It is simple to explain,  but I can't tell you the language I was using until I figured out the controller conflict.Now, I can acutally play the game after 3 hours of research on-line. Thank you internet. Shame on Steam.Game is a well written RPG with good graphics. Each ""town folk"" has something different to say and, again, even their voice acting is well done.  Side quests are not just generic ""fetch this for me"" quests and I will pay you.  Armor is useful and well designed right from the beginning.  Weapons come in some fun and useful variations beyond longsword and bows. This is one of the few games for which I will be buying the DLC. Uplay is always a hinderance and general pain, but the game is worth the pains.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have played quite a few rpg's before, and many of them I find amazing. This game being one of them. I'm not a fan of rpg's that contain difficult controls/require you to use every key on a keyboard. I find that the most amazing rpg's are ones that spend more time on story, characters, and immerse you into the world that the creators are portraying. So far I haven't played this game for long, but I can tell that it will be an experience I wont forget. Controls are easy, plot seems interesting, and graphics are a little outdated but once you get past that, this game is a lot of fun. I recommend this game to those people who love rpg's, and for those who are just getting started. 9/10			",53,2,1,7,4,1,1

												This is close enough to Fable to make me want to play it, but far enough away with enough minor issues in just the right places to make it annoying. It's so close to being a great game, but it just isn't. This game was written by my favorite writer: R.A. Salvatore.This game's art was directed by my favorite comic book arist: Todd Macfarlane.One of the creator's of Morrowind's engine was responsible for this game's engine, and I loved Morrowind.I wanted this to succeed more than anyone, but it fell flat. It has the repetition of an MMO, but without the other players to fill that void. The combat is decent, but not good enough to make up for the repetition. The characters are mildly interesting, and the voice acting is good. I would even say the graphics hold up even in 2017 because of the art style they chose. I just keep waiting for the point where I get immersed in the world, and it just isn't happening.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I adore this game. Ive been playing RPG's for years. I think aiming for 5 million sales for a first game is a little overreaching , even if its good, their aim should of been a million or so and then make then ext one even bigger. Elder Scrolls didnt get hugely successful in its first games. The expectations were just to high for this for a first game of an unknown franchise.I enjoy the fun of the combat, i enoy the story archs, the wonderful IRISH flavour of the universe. The Winter and Summer Fae are a fantastic concept and all the villages and towns and cities in the game are beautifully realized, that still leave a little to the imagination.If you are seeking a fun , action rpg, that has a wonderful in-depth fictional Irish fairy tale type story, to sink your teeth into , this is great.

However, the scenery is very nice in places and they did at least TRY to make interesting combat, but it becomes very repetitive after the first quarter.It's definitely not the worst game I've played, and I can understand people enjoying it as a mindless time-killer, but I cannot recommend it.

												I spent hours playing this game, hoping at some point that it would get better. Sadly it did not.The action in the game is quite good, one as to be on their toes when fighting multiple monters/enemies. But sadly it gets repetitive.The monsters that you encounter in beginning will be the same ones that you encounter at the very end. All they do is call them different things. Example: ""Weak boggart in the beginning versus Strong Boggart"" in the end. The characters are forgettable, some of them really even have no business being in the plot. The quests are fun at first but then they just devolve into ""go here, kill 5 wolves, come back"" The plot is interesting and seemingly original at first but by half way into the story it just turns into total garbage. The main antagonist isn't even that interesting. His dialogue is terrible, one dimensional, and repetitive. The voice acting of him is done by what sounds like a sick old man.And everyone talks to you as if you have NO POWER at all, despite the constant acts you carry out that continually prove that you have god like powers.I literally killed a demon the size of a 6 story building in one part of the story, only for the antagonist to talk to me afterwards as if I was some weak puppy that had the strength of an ant. Even one of your friends in the story acts like she could beat you down any time she wants, even though you constantly kick 500 times more butt than she ever could.The endgame is no fun, not even a challenge. Once you get past a certain level and can make your own gear, you pretty much sleep walk through the late stages of the game.I did my first playthrough of this game on HARD and I killed the final boss in 4 hits... yes you read that right, 4 hits. The difficulty on this game is a total joke.I would only recommend this game for kids, if you are a seasoned RPG or action game players, this will be a serious let down.			",242,44,1,36,17,3,47

												[Edited Review]So now I am officially, 65+ hours in and have beaten most of the factions and both DLC's. This is still a really good game and I do recomend it for those who love R.A. Salvatore novels, Spawn and TES:Oblivion. As I stated in my earlier review, this game is set up to where if you do not pay attention especially during the tutorials, you will screw up and have to experiment on your own with some things to figure out how they work.I'm still no where near beating this game, but I dont plan on giving up any time soon. I'm just enjoyin how immense the open world is and exploring it as much as I can to make sure I don't miss anything important.If they had a a 5-star rating for this game, I'd give it a 5/5. I really recommend this, even if you can just find a demo of it to try it out before purchasing.			",163,19,4,64,15,0,17

												I have been playing this game for 5-6 hours but it is already enought for me to comment on couple of things. Overall, it is a great game. It has good story (I learned that it gets better later on) and a great nature.  It is a very magical and adventurous world. So, Pros;+Very very playable in 2015 thanks to its wow-like cartoonish graphics. Patch it with SweetFX and it's just great. In vanilla, there is just too much gloom. +Good and fun fighting mechanics. +Detailed skill trees, builds, races and playable classes. +Side quests are detailed and fun.+Probably many more that I couldn't find out or think about yet. Cons;-Areas are kinda empty. There are so many vast (and beautiful) areas without life except harmful creatures. -Vanilla gloomy graphics. -Limitations in areas. (It is not as open-world.)-Missing mounts!			",73,11,3,12,5,3,5

												Very good roleplaying game. Graphics and effects are colourists, with nice locations and creatures as well. The mechanics are little clumsy, and has initial problems of control configuration. Huge map based on zones. More than 200 missions of all kinds, with few bugs, many dialogues are repetitive or useless. Is easy, or not fine leveled: passed 75% of game the player can reach max level and be rich, but can reconfigure his skills anytime. Included a stealth system and a really usefull crafting system. Expansions are big and essentials. Strongly recomended for newbies of the genre.			",308,48,0,52,30,1,96

												Pour ceux et celles qui veulent un jeu semblable à Skyrim, je vous le recommande fortement!Voici ma comparaison avec le jeu Skyrim.Ce qui semblable à Skyrim:-Le jeu est traduit en français.-Il est completement en monde ouvert, par cela je veux dire que vous pouvez voyagez librement à travers d'Amalur, de plus, vous pouvez continuer a jouer même si vous avez complété la quête principale. Comme dans Skyrim.- L'histoire est intriguante.- Style de jeu Médiéval fantaisie- Système de compétances semblable à Skyrim, pour certain point meilleurs, pour d'autre, différents. Ce qui est meilleur que Skyrim.- Variété de style de combat.- Les graphismes sont plus féériques que Skyrim. Ils sont bien fait.Ce qui est différent de Skyrim:-Dans Skyrim, vous pouvez ramasser toute sorte de chose utiles ou inutiles, dans Amalur, non. Vous devez détruire des boîtes ou ouvrir des coffres pour collecter des objets. Si l'enemi que vous tuer avais une épée en acier, lorsque vous allez looter son cadavre, vous optiendrez des objets fort différents voir même rien du tout. Les horaires des PNJs aurraient pu être plus élaborée et réaliste comme dans Skyrim. (Exemple, un garde reste au meme poste 24h/24...Je pourais en dire plus, mais pour résumer, je recommande fortement ce jeu. Il est très immersif et très bien optimisé, je peux y jouer aver mon ordinateur portable Toshiba.			",25,0,0,14,1,0,4

												This game is a third person RPG that truly resembles RPGs around the Era of Oblivion and to be honest if it had been released then it would of made millions. But the timing was not right.It seemed unfinished with only one model for each weapon type and barely any difference in armour.The combat was interesting with different specialised weapons to use with each class. The action bar worked especially well for it. The main mechanic that the combat was all based around was a sort of slow mo that seems to make you do extra damage whilst giving you the ability to do very impressive final hits or death blows. The class systems truly do make a difference and seem to be the biggest decision you will make in the game. The special attacks and weapons were the high point as well as the blends of the difference classes. (I played a Rogue/Mage)The world reminded me a lot of the original Fable with the same reputation system and choice system. But your decisions didnt really feel like they were making a difference... Except for maybe a few larger points.The artwork once again reminded me of Fable but the render distance for me was an issue. The world was always fun to explore with secrets hidden everywhere and new towns and houses to explore. The questing was good and it didnt make you feel like you were grinding like some other RPGs. There are hundreds of side quests to spend your time on until you decide whether you want to buy the DLC or not.Overall I loved this game even though it had its issues.. If it had a little more time and maybe more funding? It could of been amazing but this is where it was at, I have heard that modding the game can fix a lot of the issues I had with it such as the weapon models.I rate it a 7/10			",103,9,0,6,9,0,15

												Pros: Love this game. The world and characters are interesting and well realized. (but you don't have to pay close attention if you don't want to)Combat is fun, and challenging on the hard setting.  Great graphics consideringItems are fairly interestingThe abilities are coolThe amount I enjoyed this game. Started a 20 hour character on my friends PS3, he accidently deleted it.  Started another character on my PS3, leveled him a little past the orginal character, and stopped playing my PS3 in favour of PC, RESTARTED AGAIN, and played the whole story through. ConsI played a rogue(with a TINY bit of mage), seems like good daggers are few and far between, and stealth isn't very useful with boss fights...Travelling is a pain, think Vanilla WoW with no mountsQuests are repeatative. Had to put the game down for a month or two at a time, and come back. Did that about 4 times.Levels are a grind at 25+ I highly recommend this game to any RPG fan with a bit of time.

												 This is the case of a game that could have been more and falters to stumble to a unremarkable finish. The concept of the game allows for free class shifting allowing a wide range of combat playstyles to be changed often but the quest themselves are fairly rotuine for the fantasy genre.  It is however my personal feeling that where the game fails most is in providing an endgame to care about. The climatic battle of the game is comes well before the final boss who is introduced in name but fails to engage as a plot device and dies mere seconds after appearing, the final zones provide nothing that you  haven't seen dozens of times since due to poor level pacing you most likely hit max level several zones ago. But you''ll notice I still recommend the game, despite these drawbacks its still fun to play if taking for what it offers. Picked up on sale it will easily provide enough to make is worth the price and that's really all a game needs to do.			",112,208,6,101,60,1,82

Dare I say even better than Skyrim? Sure, the world isn't as ""open"" as Skyrim, but the graphics are more colorful, it plays more ""actiony"", and the story is richer. Nothing makes you feel more powerful or awesome than throwing a pair of chakrams and taking out all of the enemies around you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Always thought this game got caught in the vortex of ME3/DA2 and ended up ignored and forgotten.  I certainly distanced myself from buying EA games a lot after ME3.   But I took the plunge a while ago and bought this game in one of the sales on steam and enjoyed it very much (hell,  I spend over 240 hours of my time on it...).  So yes, I would recommend it if you like loot, crafting, sidequests. It has some flaws, but what game hasn't. Well worth it on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There is so much to say, and only so much time in a day. This game is one of my favorites. Atmosphere is incredible. Graphics are very detailed, so much so in the rendering that it can hardly be seen as cartoon. The story is extremely deep, and as of yet, I still haven't gotten to the bottom of it. Many hours I played this game offline, and thereby didn't register as I was without internet. The class/combat variety is wonderfully done, and the effects animations are right in line. Sitting here for a few minutes to try and think of a negative to this game, and as yet still can't. So long as you don't mind the threshold of cartoon getting meshed into reality visually speaking, it is a very well developed experience and I would highly recommend it. Definitely play again.

												Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning™, when I first read about this game before it's release it claimed it would be a Elder Scrolls killer but as some people many know that it really wasn't that case.The game has good and bad qualities about it.Lets start with the story, the story isn't a strong point for this game and is pretty generic for an RPG and after you play through it once, playing through it again is something you just seem to want to avoid, though the concept for the story itself was pretty good.The Combat. The Combat is this game is in my opinion better then Skyrims, in Skyrim I just felt like I was just whaling on people like some untrained warrior, but in Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning™ it felt a lot more smooth and just flowed a lot better and some enemies I needed to learns some of there moves and time my dodges right to either take no damage or at least not suffer a large blow. It is true that after a few hours the combat can become a bit or even entirely boring as you will have a solid tactic to spam with crowds, bosses or big creatures.'Fateshift' is basically a super, nothing can really stand up to you when your in this form and the final kill animation is great and the fact that there are many make it so it doesn't become boring that quickly, though I found that in my later level Fateshift was something I always had and clould eaily build up but I never used it as I found no enemy challenging.The World. Kingdom of Amalurs world is extremly nice with a good colour palette, though the game is a bit aged right now it's still a great world to explore and just look at. The characters were very well Voice acted and it was nice to have everyone in the game have a voice instead of just text, well I say everyone what I mean is everyone but the character you play as, he/she is a silent protagonist and it really seemed to kill some of the games immutation as people who you talk to seem to express something to whats going on and to what you just said while you just seem to stand there with a blank expression of nothingness on your face not give a sh*t.The Classes. Now I enjoyed the class system in this game, I found it to be better then Skyrims as you can't get to the point were you can level up every tree (I'm talking without Mods) you have to choose to either focus on one tree and become a Warlord, Nightblade or Archmage which means you master all the weapon and gain the top tier abilities.You could go into two trees and become either a Blademaster, Shadowcaster or Champion with these sorts of builds you don't reach the top of either trees which means you don't gain the top tier abilities.You could go into all three trees at once and become a Jack of all traits person or as it's named Universalist, which means you're gonna be getting mostly the basics of all the trees.The classes themselves some with different effects and stats themselfs, to boost damamge or Mana regan per second also the Shadowcaster class had a poison blink ability that replace dodge.The class system in this game makes choosing a class to strive to a did more hard as you know how far you will go in the trees.Side Quests. Side quests could be both good and bad, in some you just be fetching something and in other you would be exploring caves and dungeons, so overall I find the side quests to be like every other RPG a combination of good and bad, with some being fun and interesting and other being dull and pointless all together.Crafting. I only went into Blacksmithing and made some of my best gear it was simple to do and rewarding still, but for the other crafting options in the game well I'm not gonna say anything about them, not because there bad but because as I said I didn't go into them, I soley did Blacksmithing.The DLC. You have 2 DLC's not including the Weapons pack, these DLC's are Teeth of Naros and The Legend of Dead Kel, both DLC's never seem to improve the story but are good for higher level players to get good gear and fight enemies the same level and sometimes even higher.Teeth of Naros. Honestly I didn't enjoy this one to much, the combat was sameish and the story was just something I didn't pay much attation to as it didn't interest me.I'd give this DLC a 5/10 as the story isn't so great that it kept my attention but the fights were good as you faced a new selection of enemies and got both good armor and gear from it, but when I finished the story line I was gone from that DLC area.The Legend of Dead Kel. I enjoyed this DLC more the Naros, the story was somewhat interesting and the combat was good aswell and with the addition with the Keep that you get which honestly was great at first, after a while you start to feel a bit detatched from it as the pets you get and raise just give you a stat increase and then are in a corner of the Keep, you don't get to take them outside the keep nor can you have them walking with you in the Keep. You also get a Scavenger who will find people in ship wrecks who will become something in your keep and get you closer to the end of the Keeps quest line, but after you find everyone you'll send him out sleep for 24 hours and get items and then repeat and if he says he lost the bag you'll be dealing with a group of bandits you can easily cut through to get Items to sell, gets boring after 2-3 trips there. There are other people who do different things but you'll find that the only person you'll use in the end after you've done everything in the keep is the Scavenger guy because he gets you items to sell and make more money that you don't need because you've got the best gear but because why not.I'd give this DLC a 6/10 the story is somewhat good and the combat is still good but the Keep seems to both be it's strongest and weakest point as when you first get it you;ve got lots of things to do but it runs out in the blink of an eye and the Keep is just something that you have.Overall I enjoyed the game, it had it's flaws and wasn't close to being an Elder scrolls killer8/10 Rating from me			",111,6,0,9,5,1,6

												Great Gem of a Game, especially if you get it on Sale. I actually like this better than Skyrim, which is somewhat similar. Sure, there are a few kinks, you'll have to live with:- Too easy (seriously, this is not Dark Souls, and the only Boss so far which took more than afew attempts for me was the Maiden of Windemere). Strongly recommend to play this on ""Hard""...- Somewhat limited amount of different enemy models, which get repeated with increased stats later in the game. Could have used a few more different monsters- Shop system somewhat broken - even though you get tons of great stuff dropped, I would now and then like to buy that specific item from a shop - but they are just to damn expensive, considering you'd also need your cash for trainers - Annoying inventory bugs, especially with Dead Kel DLC, where you can't get rid of items from closed questsOther than that I'd rate it 9 out of 10. Highlight is the great variety of missions and quests, mostly well scripted, combined with a well structured quest system. I also pretty much like the graphics/looks, which - especially for outdoors/Landscapes - are somewhat less grimy than e.g. Skyrim.			",1093,283,50,175,93,5,291

												Recommended, as long as you run Widescreen Fixer to give yourself a more zoomed-out camera / wider field of view. The default is waaaay to close for my comfort. If you're looking for an RPG where choices matter, look elsewhere - I completed nearly all the available quests, and I can count on one hand the number of them where you actually had to make any decisions about how to complete them, and maybe... one? where there was any sort of fail state if you picked the wrong dialogue options. If you just want something where you can kill dudes while traversing the overworld and dungeons, perhaps while listing to podcasts or otherwise multitasking, this is it.			",241,95,7,45,16,0,32

												Awesome gameplay, awesome story, awesome level up/skill mechanics. A beast of a game. Too bad its producer is now defunct. This game needs a follow up in the same universe. Pros :-Nice skill leveling -Great visuals -A nice story with some twists-Many different character design choices -Huge land with varying monsters- Awesome spells -Nice weapon and armor designs Cons : -Bugs that block progress -Running around too much to get really far away place is tiresome-Sometimes quests can be too tedious to do-Character animations sometimes can be annoying -No jumping so to reach a high place that is 5 cm above you have to go through a long way to get up therewhich sucks.

												Love this game. It does have it's slow moments due to the fact it was built upon the remnants of the MMORPG the game was originally supposed to be so there are lots of mmo type quests and a vast world with about 30 or so areas.Talent trees while generic are well thought out. and are supplemented by gate cards which allow your character to specialize into a class based on how many points you have spent in each of the 3 trees. ( Might, Finess, Sorcery)These cards even come fully stocked with hybrid classes for people like me who like to mix and match for interesting character set ups.  Each class can add some itneresting features as you slowly upgrade with more points.An example would be once you have enough sorcery in the rpimary and hybrid sorc classes your dodge can become a short teleport instead of a roll.I highly recommend this game expecially if it is on sale.

												Very good roleplaying game. Graphics and effects are colourists, with nice locations and creatures as well. The mechanics are little clumsy, and has initial problems of control configuration. Huge map based on zones. More than 200 missions of all kinds, with few bugs, many dialogues are repetitive or useless. Is easy, or not fine leveled: passed 75% of game the player can reach max level and be rich, but can reconfigure his skills anytime. Included a stealth system and a really usefull crafting system. Expansions are big and essentials. Strongly recomended for newbies of the genre.			",308,48,0,52,30,1,96

												Pour ceux et celles qui veulent un jeu semblable à Skyrim, je vous le recommande fortement!Voici ma comparaison avec le jeu Skyrim.Ce qui semblable à Skyrim:-Le jeu est traduit en français.-Il est completement en monde ouvert, par cela je veux dire que vous pouvez voyagez librement à travers d'Amalur, de plus, vous pouvez continuer a jouer même si vous avez complété la quête principale. Comme dans Skyrim.- L'histoire est intriguante.- Style de jeu Médiéval fantaisie- Système de compétances semblable à Skyrim, pour certain point meilleurs, pour d'autre, différents. Ce qui est meilleur que Skyrim.- Variété de style de combat.- Les graphismes sont plus féériques que Skyrim. Ils sont bien fait.Ce qui est différent de Skyrim:-Dans Skyrim, vous pouvez ramasser toute sorte de chose utiles ou inutiles, dans Amalur, non. Vous devez détruire des boîtes ou ouvrir des coffres pour collecter des objets. Si l'enemi que vous tuer avais une épée en acier, lorsque vous allez looter son cadavre, vous optiendrez des objets fort différents voir même rien du tout. Les horaires des PNJs aurraient pu être plus élaborée et réaliste comme dans Skyrim. (Exemple, un garde reste au meme poste 24h/24...Je pourais en dire plus, mais pour résumer, je recommande fortement ce jeu. Il est très immersif et très bien optimisé, je peux y jouer aver mon ordinateur portable Toshiba.			",25,0,0,14,1,0,4

												[Edited Review]So now I am officially, 65+ hours in and have beaten most of the factions and both DLC's. This is still a really good game and I do recomend it for those who love R.A. Salvatore novels, Spawn and TES:Oblivion. As I stated in my earlier review, this game is set up to where if you do not pay attention especially during the tutorials, you will screw up and have to experiment on your own with some things to figure out how they work.I'm still no where near beating this game, but I dont plan on giving up any time soon. I'm just enjoyin how immense the open world is and exploring it as much as I can to make sure I don't miss anything important.If they had a a 5-star rating for this game, I'd give it a 5/5. I really recommend this, even if you can just find a demo of it to try it out before purchasing.			",163,19,4,64,15,0,17

												I have been playing this game for 5-6 hours but it is already enought for me to comment on couple of things. Overall, it is a great game. It has good story (I learned that it gets better later on) and a great nature.  It is a very magical and adventurous world. So, Pros;+Very very playable in 2015 thanks to its wow-like cartoonish graphics. Patch it with SweetFX and it's just great. In vanilla, there is just too much gloom. +Good and fun fighting mechanics. +Detailed skill trees, builds, races and playable classes. +Side quests are detailed and fun.+Probably many more that I couldn't find out or think about yet. Cons;-Areas are kinda empty. There are so many vast (and beautiful) areas without life except harmful creatures. -Vanilla gloomy graphics. -Limitations in areas. (It is not as open-world.)-Missing mounts!			",73,11,3,12,5,3,5

The play style is fun and very easy to get used to. I love how customizable the play style can be with 3 different trees to choose from (Warrior, Sneak, or Magic) each have multiple paths to follow as well and you can mix several of the trees as well and make a magic using warrior if you'd like.The story was good, and held my attention throughout the whole game (which is rare). Plenty of side quest, crafting and lock picking were fun.I would highly recommend this game to anyone			",63,7,2,16,13,0,10

												Can't recommend this game highly enough ... and at 75% off, it stretches your entertainment dollar beyond all reason. Has been sitting on my wishlist for a couple of years now, jumped on it the first day of the Summer sale and couldn't be happier I did. If you're an RPG fan definitely grab it. Has a much better combat system than Skyrim, expansive areas to explore, simple but highly useful crafting system, and tons of loot. The graphics are fine, nothing to write home about even back when it was made. I'm about 75% through the game and the story is fine and detailed with a good amount of lore. definitely merited a sequel and with the proper amount of money pumped in, could have rivaled the Elder Scrolls --- except with much better combat. Lastly, since you can reset all your abilities and points easily during the game, you can play any way you like whenever you like ... tired of being a Mage and using Staves or scepters ... reset ... be a stealthy rogue, or a two hander or a sword and board or ... 9/10, if I had known how good the game is, I would easily consider buying it at full price without feeling cheated in any way.

												Absolutely awesome game! The combat is so good and satisfying that you dont even mind grinding for fun. It works very good and it is fluid and responsive with mouse and keyboard. The developers did a very good job porting this to PCs. If you liked Fable, this is better in my opinion. Anyway, this game is a MUST HAVE for any RPG or Action fan. Even hack'n' slash fans will enjoy the combat. It has combos,spells, two weapon sets, slowing time and fatalities (finishing enemies in style). The game offers easy, normal and hard mode available from the start. If you have bought the Weapon and Armors DLC (buy it as a complete pack, it is so worth it !!!) you will get purple weapons and gold armors at almost the begining of the game, making the game so much easy (Casual Mode only I guess). Those who want challenge can still folow the traditional way and earn and craft their own. The story and quests are fully voiced only your character is silent. It feels like a downside but it is not very important in my opimion. You dont have a quest log on your screen - which is good - but the minimap shows the diresctions you need to go to. Oh!!  and there is fast travel to discovered locations directly from the world map. This is great for returnig to receive rewards.it is worth the full price tag, but now on sales, it is like a gift from gods LOL ",43,37,6,11,43,0,6

												AMAZING Action RPG. Combat is satisfying, story is interesting and everything is far as heck away from everything else.Don't get me wrong, i love this game. BUT everything is a LONG hike away. There are also only certain points you can use to drop from higher levels to lower ones (AND NOT BACK UP). Everything feels unnecesarilly far away, so be prepared to stare at scenery bc you'll be doing lots of it. STILL worth playing the fun parts though!			",1384,410,64,120,148,18,218

												Back when this came out I played the demo and bought it for 360. Played the holy hell out of it. Just picked it up on sale and am repeating. The game is fantastic. Seriously. Such a shame that it will exist as a one off and no follow ups will take place. The world is interesting, rich, and gorgeous. On a meta level the game reminds me of playing an mmo solo but with combat that takes certian elements from the arkham games while adding in a nice dash of strategy to how you go about things. On lower difficulty your build wont matter a whole lot but increase the difficulty and you can find yourself in a bit of a pickle so pay attention to what loot you are getting and how it factors into your way of playing. If I had my play times from the 360 version I would reckon I have spent 200+ hours on the base game and its expansions - which you should also buy because they are every bit as good as the base game. My only real issue is that there is not more DLC. I need more of this game. Strage situation seeing as EA published it and they would milk the♥♥♥♥♥♥off a tic tac toe clone if they could. Strange times.			",153,8,5,11,11,0,14

												I have been playing this game for 5-6 hours but it is already enought for me to comment on couple of things. Overall, it is a great game. It has good story (I learned that it gets better later on) and a great nature.  It is a very magical and adventurous world. So, Pros;+Very very playable in 2015 thanks to its wow-like cartoonish graphics. Patch it with SweetFX and it's just great. In vanilla, there is just too much gloom. +Good and fun fighting mechanics. +Detailed skill trees, builds, races and playable classes. +Side quests are detailed and fun.+Probably many more that I couldn't find out or think about yet. Cons;-Areas are kinda empty. There are so many vast (and beautiful) areas without life except harmful creatures. -Vanilla gloomy graphics. -Limitations in areas. (It is not as open-world.)-Missing mounts!			",73,11,3,12,5,3,5

												Picked this one up on sale back in June for $10 (game + all DLC). If you're looking for blockbuster material, you won't find it here.The story is excellent and the lore to back it up equally great. So if story driven stuff is what you're after, you should enjoy this. For me, it was the sole reason I went ahead with playing it to completion.The main problem is the graphics and gameplay drag it down badly. I've been talking about it in passing as though it was a 2006 release because frankly it doesn't look as nice as Oblivion, then just noticed it has a 2012 date on it. OK.Gameplay is very very MMO-ey, and as it turns out there's a reason for that. It was supposed to be one at one point but got downscaled into a single player game. So yo have lots and lots of combat action and loot grinding going on.The two DLCs were actually much better than the main game too, though that could be because I'm partial to content that gives me castles and keeps to build and upgrade :POver all, worth it when it's on sale. I'd not pay the full $40 for the whole collection though.			",16,5,0,15,1,0,7

												Pros: Love this game. The world and characters are interesting and well realized. (but you don't have to pay close attention if you don't want to)Combat is fun, and challenging on the hard setting.  Great graphics consideringItems are fairly interestingThe abilities are coolThe amount I enjoyed this game. Started a 20 hour character on my friends PS3, he accidently deleted it.  Started another character on my PS3, leveled him a little past the orginal character, and stopped playing my PS3 in favour of PC, RESTARTED AGAIN, and played the whole story through. ConsI played a rogue(with a TINY bit of mage), seems like good daggers are few and far between, and stealth isn't very useful with boss fights...Travelling is a pain, think Vanilla WoW with no mountsQuests are repeatative. Had to put the game down for a month or two at a time, and come back. Did that about 4 times.Levels are a grind at 25+ I highly recommend this game to any RPG fan with a bit of time.

												The combat is great. The environments are interesting. Graphics are pretty. Main quest feels like it was worth it. DLC was fun especially Teeth of Naros. Crafting is a little wonky and could have been better (lots of things seem useless after a certain level). Runs into the same problems most RPGs do with economy - nowhere to spend the ridiculous amount of money your character generates so by the end you are a bloated dragon creature resting on top of your treasure horde which in most games is a quest enemy ... anyways buy this on sale it is worth the 10 bucks			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Id like to go on record as saying that I am a picky MO FO when it comes to RPs... That said... This is one fo the best RPGs I have played in the last 20 years, graphics not withstanding. It is masively expansive, every time I thought the game was over it just kept rolling out more story and all of the stories hold their own then come together to form an even larger story! I have spent many hours just getting to lvl 20 and I feel like I have been through wave after wave of build up then grind. I love the look of it as well as the support characters (some of who make me want to slap the poo out of them, others make me want to take them behind closed doors...), I give this game a 9.5/10 It loses .5 points because the merchant buy/sell menu makes you wade through ALL of your gear to sell a few things that you dont want (Including the crafting gear which if you are a collecter can be MASSIVE). The merchant menu should be more like the menu in your houses storage box, now that would be superb! A must buy for any real RPer out there! And dont forget the DLC!			",245,6,0,46,16,1,9

												WARNING: SPOILERS MAYBETo be honest, this game is bad, despite good combat system and tons of content. It's just failing to hold you to play. It's okay in short bursts. It's a pretty nice action rpg, but killing thousands and thousands of same enemies (which can take a lot of time, esp near the end, because game just throwing dozens of tuatha elite troops, and trolls at you)Combat system has it's own flaws too. It becomes repetitive as heck after a while, because you usually stick to two weapons, which suits you (in my case - chakrams and greatsword). It's still entertaining to watch, but if there a lot of enemies there is a great chance that character will be stunlocked.Quests are pretty bore too. It's either fetch-quests or kill quests, with very very rare puzzles. And tasks - WoW dailies. Bring me ten bear legs to get a bag of gold. Rince and repeat.Factions - kinda good. Travelers and warsworn are pretty good, nothing original, but still pretty good. Backstabbing, heroic deeds all that kind of stuff. Kinda wish there were more epic fight and moments like in main story. Houses of ballads and sorrows, and mage's guild - good story, but notthing incredible. I even can't decide whether i want to be the bad guy or the good guy.Overall i would call this game average at most. Some good ideas, decent fighting system, tons of not so interesting content, but extremely repetitive.			",100,7,0,7,0,0,13

												This game crashes on my computer so I don't play it much here, but I've played a few dozen hours on an Xbox.I have never played an RPG with combat this good.  It's so smooth, but still challenging, and you feel like a badass.  Almost every enemy feels like a really easy Dark Souls boss; they all have unique movesets that you have to learn to time your attacks around.  Your own attacks are actually dynamic.  You know how in the Elder Scrolls games, you're totally helpless when you're in mid-swing and melee combat is very straightforward, with almost no variety?  The devs of KoA were like ""screw that, let's make combat FUN"".  1: you have a dodge roll (a basic requirement for any melee combat game).  2: Up until the last two hits of your combo, you're completely free to move around and cancel your attacks mid-swing.  This is incredible for when you're wailing on a troll and a wolf comes up to bite your♥♥♥♥♥-you can dodge out of there without waiting for your movement to finish.  This makes the game feel much faster-paced.  Being outnumbered is a problem, sure, but you're quick enough to deal with it.  The game is pretty short, though, and there isn't much end-game content.  My friend and I chugged through it in maybe ten or twelve hours.  After that, all you can really do is re-run stuff you've already done.  The combat is so fun that it doesn't really matter, though.

My gripe is that the game gets pretty easy when you level. There is a third party project/ mod/ tool that helps to address this. I also felt like a lot of the NPC quests and dialouge did not feel very... real. Hard to describe. But I do recomend all RPG fans give this game a shot. Watch it and buy it when its around 75% off.4/5 but a strong good title			",36,20,0,25,20,0,7

												This game is a classic for me. I had it from a long time ago but lost it. When it went on sale on Steam I grabbed it right away.  It has one of my favorite combat systems for RPGs, and the aesthetics are well done as well. The story was interesting, engaging and well-written. The side quests were usually worth it and all the guild quests were very good. The only real problem I had was that I wished there was more. I finished the main quest, all the guild quests and a good chunk of the side quests in only 50hrs-ish. Still a good game though. Definitely worth the price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the most underrated games ever made. It had the misfortune of releasing just a couple months after skyrim did and I think that is the biggest reason that it was unable to succeed.The combat in this feels great. Switching between your ranged weapon, melee and magic feels smooth and fluid. You definitely have an advantage over the enemies in 1v1 situations but at the same time can get overwhelmed by large number if you're not careful.If you are looking for a RPG to pass your time this is for you.

												One of the best medieval rpg's I've ever played. I have to admit it but I did liked it more than skyrim. This game is as open as any other open world rpg game out there. But, what I like the most about it is that most of the missions you do, you do them in the open world, not in a cave like skyrim did all the time. On top of that it has graphics that wont get you tired after playing it for a few hours. It's clean, beautiful, colorful and it fits the fantasy music theme that plays in the background as you play the game. Love the game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I tried using a controller. I tried killing the troll in the center of the room, per suggestions online. Nothing. I am unable to progress because I'm unable to finish this sequence.

												This is a fantastic game that had a lot of potential as an MMO. It was intended to be an introduction to a new MMO world, so the game is packed with lore around every corner. If you like lore, this game is for you. If you don't like reading, like all the books in the Elder Scrolls Series, you're in luck because this game gives you the lore through ""lorestones."" All you have to do is click on the lorestone, and listen to a narrator read off the stone while you continue to aventure. If you happen to miss something they said, you can aways pause the game and listen again through the menu. Each area has a set of 5-7 stones, and listening to all of them gives you a permanent bonus of some kind.The controls are fluid and easy, You have two weapon sets, which you can quickly change between, and spells are set to the number keys 1-9, and cast through the right mouse button. The only problem with the controls is that there is virtually no camera control. You can move the camera around your character, but you cannot zoom in or out which is a huge problem. There are mods to fix this, or you can get used to it if you ignore it long enough.The only other major problem is the leveling system. It's quick and doesn't drag, which seemed good at first, but about halfway through the game it is easy to over-level above the level range of the areas and quickly get boring trying to do quests that extremely underleveled. To avoid this problem simply don't use any gear that gives an XP bonus, and don't get the bonus XP for kills in ""reckoning mode.""Other than the camera and the experience system, the game is visually stunning and a great play. The story is interesting, which is why i didn't mention much of it here. To sum it up you have died and been brought back to life, which means you are no longer bound by fate. Not being bound by fate means that every life you save should have died, and every life you kill shouldn't have been killed. Your existence can turn the tides of wars long forseen by the gods to end a certain way, and certain powers in the world want to use you to their greater aim.			",88,16,0,23,7,2,15

												Amalur is a brilliant game to get lost in. I found myself wandering the world embracing all the unique landscapes of regions in Amalur. The aesthetic and colour to the game is magnificent, and I always found myself appreciating the variety of regional areas the game had to offer. Each has it's own lore, story, quests and tales, beautifully dictated by the lorestones scattered about the world.Lorestones are superb, and I found the voice acting brilliant for specifically the lorestones. Although it lacks in dialouge and it is apparent that many voice actors were reused for several character, which I understand due to the vast world Amalur has to offer. There's hundreds of unique NPC's with unique dialogue to keep you interested, and Amalur never lacks in conversation with NPCs from region to region.Each region is unique, but I feel like I need to elaborate on this more. Every place you go to has it's own unique story and urban legends, many containing quests pertaining to these. Some of my favourites and ones to look out for are Canneroc (a spider infested town, with a strange woman at cause) and The Red Marches (a strange cult has swooped in and slaughtered an entire town, why.) These are just two instances of what makes Amalur a great game and examples of the hours of content you can obtain from it.Another thing is that the lore is huge, and you have to earn it. Lorestones are the main source of knowlege throughout Amalur, although their are quite a few books located throughout the world containing information also. But Lorestones are convenient and a nice addition as you don't need to read an in-game book and pause for a few minutes to learn something new about Amalur. You also get a small bonus for completing a 'set' of lorestones, which encourages you to learn the full story.Then there's the combat. The combat in Amalur is so fast-paced and exciting, with so many combos. I love it. I played as primarily a warrior on my PC playthrough, but I remember how satisfying been a mage was in this game, which is what a lot of games tend to miss out on. Also, stealth didn't feel that overpowered for once, as, while you could one shot normal creatures, been undetected the entire time was hard to pull off.Amalur is not without it's flaws though, as their are many bugs in the game. Especially quest bugs, such as dungeons respawning as soon as a quest is finished...while still in the dungeon. This can potentially break certain quests or bring characters you've just completed a quest for to their untimely demise. Another bug I ran into during my PC playthrough is that audio would cut out during Reckoning mode, and stay that way occasionally. Only a restart seemed to solve this problem.Another problem is that the main quest is pretty drab, The main quest has it's high points, but the entire premise is cliche (you're the only one that can save the world, you're the only one who can control their own fate, save us all!) But, I found the characters quite likeable, but I felt like they could of been fleshed out a little more. Amalur kind of feels like an MMO with the tons of quests but very little fleshing out of characters. It feels as though everyone is insignificant to you, which I guess they technically are if you think of the main quest plot.What amazes me about Amalur the most though is how it can appeal to all sorts of players. When I originally played the game on XBOX all I cared about was the combat and the boss-fights and all the unique weapons and armors in the game. But when on my PC playthrough I took the time to learn about the story of each region, and the overall lore of the world. This made me appreciate the game a lot more, but made me realize that Amalur can appeal to both the casual and hardcore loremaster players that are attracted to modern RPGs. Amalur somehow makes a blend of fluid combat, an expansive world and interesting lore to appeal to the adventures, fighters, and scholars in each of us. And it's fantastic. ",179,27,4,16,12,0,9

												This may be the best game you've never played.  Kingdoms of Amalur was a very solid game that came out at a terrible time.  It followed on the heels of Arkham City, Uncharted 3, Deus Ex, Portal 2, and of course Skyrim, and followed just a little too late for most people to really feel like dropping $60 on it.  It's critical mediocrity and tepid sales are probably a direct result of it's poor timing.As for the game itself...The story is solid, if not entirely original.  The gameplay follows a similar vein - it's a heck of a lot of fun really.  There's serious depth to the gameplay and also the world (a magnificent and beautiful world that you could spend weeks exploring).  In many ways it feels like the love-child of Skyrim and Fable.  If you liked those two games, this is a no-brainer.   ",287,23,1,37,14,1,43

												I got this game the day it game out on 360. It is one of the best game I have ever played. If you can get it on sale do. If you miss the sale and have the money and don't have it yet..get it.I have only ever played with a 360 controler so can't speak to the KBM controls.The combat is fast. And once you get the hang of it yes it can get ez.The DLC is fun and worth it I think. The added gear from the none story DLC is way OP so I would only use it if your having a hard time. O and play on hard.. there are Mods but I have used none. The base game is a rock and is what I judge all other action combat games buy...anyway play it.			",178,71,2,63,15,1,52

												Only spent an hour playing this game because I encountered a game-breaking bug. About an hour in, you fight the first ""boss"", the rock troll. After defeating the troll, you are prompted to press F. I spent almost half an hour spamming F in every area around the troll. I tried restarting the game. Tried restarting my computer. I tried using a controller. I tried killing the troll in the center of the room, per suggestions online. Nothing. I am unable to progress because I'm unable to finish this sequence. Almost 5 years later and this game-breaking bug isn't fixed. Oh well, I guess it was only $5.			",40,8,0,15,1,0,2

												This is a fantastic game that had a lot of potential as an MMO. It was intended to be an introduction to a new MMO world, so the game is packed with lore around every corner. If you like lore, this game is for you. If you don't like reading, like all the books in the Elder Scrolls Series, you're in luck because this game gives you the lore through ""lorestones."" All you have to do is click on the lorestone, and listen to a narrator read off the stone while you continue to aventure. If you happen to miss something they said, you can aways pause the game and listen again through the menu. Each area has a set of 5-7 stones, and listening to all of them gives you a permanent bonus of some kind.The controls are fluid and easy, You have two weapon sets, which you can quickly change between, and spells are set to the number keys 1-9, and cast through the right mouse button. The only problem with the controls is that there is virtually no camera control. You can move the camera around your character, but you cannot zoom in or out which is a huge problem. There are mods to fix this, or you can get used to it if you ignore it long enough.The only other major problem is the leveling system. It's quick and doesn't drag, which seemed good at first, but about halfway through the game it is easy to over-level above the level range of the areas and quickly get boring trying to do quests that extremely underleveled. To avoid this problem simply don't use any gear that gives an XP bonus, and don't get the bonus XP for kills in ""reckoning mode.""Other than the camera and the experience system, the game is visually stunning and a great play. The story is interesting, which is why i didn't mention much of it here. To sum it up you have died and been brought back to life, which means you are no longer bound by fate. Not being bound by fate means that every life you save should have died, and every life you kill shouldn't have been killed. Your existence can turn the tides of wars long forseen by the gods to end a certain way, and certain powers in the world want to use you to their greater aim.			",88,16,0,23,7,2,15

The history its interesting sometimes i can't stop playing because i want to know what is going to happen when i finish the quest, plus u have different type of side quest, not only the usual side quest but faction quest to that can help to get some permanent bonus when u finish the entire quest or quest that u can repeat to get make some cash. The game itself its all around u can picks the paths in the story and depending on ur choice u might get different rewards or results. something that i really like its the balance between the classes it is actually balance. I strongly recommend this game if u like long games with intresting story with different paths lots of enterteaning quests and nice gameplay not so fast but not that slow its just the way it has to be.

												Amalur is a brilliant game to get lost in. I found myself wandering the world embracing all the unique landscapes of regions in Amalur. The aesthetic and colour to the game is magnificent, and I always found myself appreciating the variety of regional areas the game had to offer. Each has it's own lore, story, quests and tales, beautifully dictated by the lorestones scattered about the world.Lorestones are superb, and I found the voice acting brilliant for specifically the lorestones. Although it lacks in dialouge and it is apparent that many voice actors were reused for several character, which I understand due to the vast world Amalur has to offer. There's hundreds of unique NPC's with unique dialogue to keep you interested, and Amalur never lacks in conversation with NPCs from region to region.Each region is unique, but I feel like I need to elaborate on this more. Every place you go to has it's own unique story and urban legends, many containing quests pertaining to these. Some of my favourites and ones to look out for are Canneroc (a spider infested town, with a strange woman at cause) and The Red Marches (a strange cult has swooped in and slaughtered an entire town, why.) These are just two instances of what makes Amalur a great game and examples of the hours of content you can obtain from it.Another thing is that the lore is huge, and you have to earn it. Lorestones are the main source of knowlege throughout Amalur, although their are quite a few books located throughout the world containing information also. But Lorestones are convenient and a nice addition as you don't need to read an in-game book and pause for a few minutes to learn something new about Amalur. You also get a small bonus for completing a 'set' of lorestones, which encourages you to learn the full story.Then there's the combat. The combat in Amalur is so fast-paced and exciting, with so many combos. I love it. I played as primarily a warrior on my PC playthrough, but I remember how satisfying been a mage was in this game, which is what a lot of games tend to miss out on. Also, stealth didn't feel that overpowered for once, as, while you could one shot normal creatures, been undetected the entire time was hard to pull off.Amalur is not without it's flaws though, as their are many bugs in the game. Especially quest bugs, such as dungeons respawning as soon as a quest is finished...while still in the dungeon. This can potentially break certain quests or bring characters you've just completed a quest for to their untimely demise. Another bug I ran into during my PC playthrough is that audio would cut out during Reckoning mode, and stay that way occasionally. Only a restart seemed to solve this problem.Another problem is that the main quest is pretty drab, The main quest has it's high points, but the entire premise is cliche (you're the only one that can save the world, you're the only one who can control their own fate, save us all!) But, I found the characters quite likeable, but I felt like they could of been fleshed out a little more. Amalur kind of feels like an MMO with the tons of quests but very little fleshing out of characters. It feels as though everyone is insignificant to you, which I guess they technically are if you think of the main quest plot.What amazes me about Amalur the most though is how it can appeal to all sorts of players. When I originally played the game on XBOX all I cared about was the combat and the boss-fights and all the unique weapons and armors in the game. But when on my PC playthrough I took the time to learn about the story of each region, and the overall lore of the world. This made me appreciate the game a lot more, but made me realize that Amalur can appeal to both the casual and hardcore loremaster players that are attracted to modern RPGs. Amalur somehow makes a blend of fluid combat, an expansive world and interesting lore to appeal to the adventures, fighters, and scholars in each of us. And it's fantastic. ",179,27,4,16,12,0,9

												The combat is great. The environments are interesting. Graphics are pretty. Main quest feels like it was worth it. DLC was fun especially Teeth of Naros. Crafting is a little wonky and could have been better (lots of things seem useless after a certain level). Runs into the same problems most RPGs do with economy - nowhere to spend the ridiculous amount of money your character generates so by the end you are a bloated dragon creature resting on top of your treasure horde which in most games is a quest enemy ... anyways buy this on sale it is worth the 10 bucks			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												60+ hours off lineThis is a really underappreciated treasure.  Take any aspect of what makes a good RPG, and you'll find games that do it better than KoAR.  BUT this game does everything well.  Think of this game as an Olympian who goes home with four silver medals.  S/he wasn't the best at anything, but s/he is obvious a very good athlete.  Take a field of any eight random RPGS, and I think this game at least medals in any of those heats.			",66,22,1,42,9,0,24

												Id like to go on record as saying that I am a picky MO FO when it comes to RPs... That said... This is one fo the best RPGs I have played in the last 20 years, graphics not withstanding. It is masively expansive, every time I thought the game was over it just kept rolling out more story and all of the stories hold their own then come together to form an even larger story! I have spent many hours just getting to lvl 20 and I feel like I have been through wave after wave of build up then grind. I love the look of it as well as the support characters (some of who make me want to slap the poo out of them, others make me want to take them behind closed doors...), I give this game a 9.5/10 It loses .5 points because the merchant buy/sell menu makes you wade through ALL of your gear to sell a few things that you dont want (Including the crafting gear which if you are a collecter can be MASSIVE). The merchant menu should be more like the menu in your houses storage box, now that would be superb! A must buy for any real RPer out there! And dont forget the DLC!			",245,6,0,46,16,1,9

												Fun game with many good aspects. * 3rd person camera (there is no other camera) has a bit of delay when moving it felt like at first, but you got used to it. * When fighting starts with several enemies the camera tries to focus the entire group as some kind of arena thing, which can sometimes work poorly when the map is too small (if you are in a corridor and/or try to run away from enemies for some reason)+Lots of equipment and stuff, and you change apperance often because different effects and armor types!+Good story, and the game feels a bit MMOy with the style of towns and quests-Graphics isnt great, but you dont really think of it when you play the game-You need and EA account to login to the gameI havent finished the game yet so i might update this review later			",43,6,3,12,10,1,20

												One of the best medieval rpg's I've ever played. I have to admit it but I did liked it more than skyrim. This game is as open as any other open world rpg game out there. But, what I like the most about it is that most of the missions you do, you do them in the open world, not in a cave like skyrim did all the time. On top of that it has graphics that wont get you tired after playing it for a few hours. It's clean, beautiful, colorful and it fits the fantasy music theme that plays in the background as you play the game. Love the game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The minds behind Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning are certainly cultured in the world of fantasy RPGs. Ken Rolston brings his pedigree (and some Bethesda alumni with it) having worked on both The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind and its successor, Oblivion; while accomplished fantasy writer R.A. Salvatore breathes life into the world of Amalur, creating a 10,000 year history for the developers at Big Huge Games to pull from. When you factor in the fantastic art design from Todd McFarlane and the enthralling backing from retired baseball star Curt Schilling (yes, really), it’s easy to proclaim you have a veritable dream team of talent for the genre, and the exciting precedence for a new IP to really blossom.Reckoning starts off on the right path, even if its beginnings are fairly derivative. Upon creating your character using a fairly limited creation system, you wake up amongst a pile of festering, rotting corpses. You were previously dead yourself but have since awoken: a successful lab experiment and the latest in a long line of video game protagonists suffering from a contrived bout of amnesia. Before long you discover you’re quite the unique prospect in the land of Amalur: one without a pre-determined destiny. This is a world governed by fate, its residents able to visit fortune tellers to see how they’ll end up; left to live their lives on a decided path. Only the Tuatha – an evil race of elves – are able to be resurrected once they pass, so the fact you’re the first non-immortal to do so has shifted the balance of the kingdom and left you without the burden of a preordained life – a blank slate ready to be crafted.Not only is this a superb premise for the narrative that unfolds but, as you can imagine, it also factors into the gameplay and character building. There are three archetypal RPG classes to choose from: Might (warrior), Finesse (rogue) and Sorcery (mage). Each presents itself with different skill trees but you’re not asked to pick one, singular class. Instead, you’ll dump points into different active and passive abilities on each tree, allowing you to mix and match classes. This allows a fantastic amount of freedom and variation as you’re able to craft a skill set of your choosing, perhaps mixing together Finesse and Sorcery to create a stealthy magic-user, or combining all three sets together to reap the rewards of a well-rounded jack-of-all-trades.Depending on what path you choose you’re granted with multiple destinies that provide you additional stat bonuses. So if you choose Might you may find increased damage multipliers or supplementary health, while someone combining both Might and Sorcery may receive a bonus to elemental damage and improved mana regeneration. It’s a meritorious system that encourages experimentation, the lore endorsing re-specialisation if you want to try another path.Of course, that will come down to how you want to play Reckoning. Each class brings with it its own set of weapons, from longswords and giant hammers, through to daggers, longbows and staffs. Their over-the-top designs provide a sense of personality, while more unconventional weaponry like the chakrams and faeblades offer a welcome change of pace from the more regular fantasy tropes.Whichever set you choose you’ll find a simple one-button setup. There are no elaborate combinations for increasingly complicated attacks (whether you’re using a mouse and keyboard or a gamepad), instead you’ll time and change the pace of button presses to execute different combos. It’s easy to pick up and play and there’s a nice fluidity to the way it handles, allowing you to go from using a staff, to slicing guys up with a pair of daggers before switching to a variation of magical, elemental attacks. It hits hard and is very satisfying; Reckoning‘s bevy of diverse enemy types requiring a smattering of dodges, blocks and counters to stay out of trouble. Crowd control is often the name of the game, facing off against big and small foes; magic-users and straight up brawlers. It keeps you on your toes, the game’s loot-driven nature repeatedly throws up new weapons to starve off any sense of tedium.It’s the side quests that invoke the greatest sense of apathy – and even implicate the combat in some major ways. Along your travels you’ll encounter an overwhelming amount of quest givers; your map quickly filling up with blinking lights like it’s Christmas at Rockefeller Centre. This cluster of side quests and tasks offer little but middling content despite their increasingly high numbers. Collect x amount of items or kill y amount of enemies; it’s unimaginative and provides a stark reminder of Reckoning’s MMO beginnings (and its future), drudging up mundane and repetitive quests to pad out the content. None of it is compulsory, of course, but when a game is stacked with 200 or so quests, it would be nice if some of them were the least bit enjoyable.If you do decide to partake in any number of these quests then there’s also a real threat your character will over-level, negating any sort of difficulty the combat once had. You’ll often find yourself fighting enemies with grey names, indicating they are no match for your combat prowess; it’s a wonder they don’t flee in horror at the sight of you. This seems like a major oversight, particularly for a game as action-oriented as Reckoning is. The combat may be fantastic but it’s still relatively simple. If you play too many side quests the formula becomes rote, and that simplicity just can’t carry a hundred hour game. Reckoning may be a loot driven game, but no reward is worth the banality the side quests offer.Fortunately, the main quest line and faction quests are eminently better. Your character may be an emotionless entity, but the rest of the writing and voice acting elevates the narrative’s quality. There are branching storylines, interesting and set-piece driven combat scenarios, enjoyable boss fights and plenty of exotic locales.For the world of Amalur is a large place with distinct areas for you to explore. It doesn’t encourage exploration as much as something like Skyrim, instead opting to funnel you down corridors between much larger areas; but it’s a vast game world with plenty to see, the art style shining through despite its poor draw distance and some low-res textures. The desert area provokes an oddly befitting Wild West vibe with its orange hues and rocky mountains, while the wide open plains of Erathell are transcendent with their use of space and colour. Reckoning might not have the graphical fidelity of some of its counterparts, but its bright colour palette, excellent art design and smooth level of performance is certainly an aspect to be lauded. The orchestral score helps too: it’s often riveting, inciting a sense of enchantment and wonder, beckoning on your adventure. It’s really phenomenal throughout.The same cannot be said for all of Reckoning’s many parts, however, but there’s an enjoyable game here with some interesting ideas – providing you stick closely to the main quest line and faction quests. The drabness and profusion of the side activities is too big a dampener to ignore, especially once it significantly impacts the gratification of its combat. If you treat Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning as a shorter, story-driven experience, you’ll have a much better time of it than the completionist who chases every single side quest.Recommended ",1536,601,45,246,160,15,221

												Got this game on Xbox 360 a few years back and had fun with it mostly due to its combat system being repetitive but satisfying. Mixed with its fantasy rpg world and actually enjoyable ""fate"" class leveling system, Kingdoms of Amalur is worth a purchase. I hope this game gets a follow up somehow in the future. If you like action rpgs that play sort of like bastion meets arkham you will probably enjoy the hell outta this.			",332,54,3,39,12,6,10

Also would love to see a workshop area open up for this game, adding in everyones own armor, weapons and even creatures and npc styles.10/10 definetely worth buying and playing, if you're a RPG open-world player or not.

												The game somehow runs on my 2009 poopy computer, and still manages to look good, so that's already a good reason on why you should buy. The story seems interesting, though I haven't gotten very far yet. The combat is amazing, you have many difffernt weapon types. You also have abilities. Your class does not limit what weapons you can use.Review:Pros, works well on old computers, decent story, great combat.Cons: not really any cons. The biggest con is that a sequel will never be made. :(			",30,3,0,9,6,0,1

												I was not sure what to expect when I implusively bought Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning which was on flash sale at 75% off. To say that I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement.KoA:R can be described as a single player, action RPG type game. The title is a bit unintuitive (and perhaps tedious) This is the first game of what was likely to be a series of games. However, being released at around the same time as other games of the same genre with well-established titles (such as Skyrim) this game was rendered a failure in terms of sales. The creators are bankrupt. I was shocked to discover this, upon deciding to research this gem that I had just recently bought on sale. Do not let this discourage you, though.This game features:- A vast world to be discovered, with fast travel to places you have discovered- Hundreds, if not thousands of quests available- Very colourful, yet polished graphics- An expansive skill tree, not limited to character race- In-depth lore and storyline, well exceeding expectations of this game genre- A crafting system, which can be sub-divided into various different types of crafting- Tangible consequential decision-making (saving or killing NPC's for example)- Smooth, well polished combat system (move combos, impressive executions, satisfying blocking and dodging)- Great loot system- ReplayabilityOverall, I'd give it 9.5/10 not a perfect 10 on account of the bad title and this game will not be receiving any updates I'd imagine.

												Writing this, I can barely decide whether I would recommend the game or not.The story has a very unique feature which I like which is the ability to manipulate the strings of fate. The idea that the character you make has the ability to alter the future is pretty cool, it's not confusing either how it works, you do it by living your life and re writing things through one act at a time. The lore and the races is pretty good but standard as far as RPG's go. Weapons, magic and classes are pretty balanced as well, if you want to play a warrior mage who uses warhammers and shoots lightning you'll work just as well as pure rogue for example.. Along with this the character customization is pretty good as well. The combat system is smooth and relies on your skill as well, which is a nice alteration from the usual RPG setting of d20's or trading blows and whoever is higher level wins.The downsides however do cause a problem. I was enjoying the game at first until the story started having me run all way the hell over there to talk to someone for 30 seconds. The sad part is this is a repeating occurence, I've played about half of the story and I can't bare it anymore, I spent 20 mins running somewhere ONLY fighting things in the way, not even starting and doing the multitide of side quests along the way and the person then told me the door to the dungeon they want to go in isn't open and I need to touch a stone 30 seconds away, I do that and this is what I heard based on how I felt at this point ""Darn, well I guess your tribute to the running god did not suffice. Well here's 4 more stones to touch, and yes they are all seperated"".I feel like the game has a lot of potential and who knows maybe I have called quits too early in the story but after 15 hours only invested in the one character I feel like the story should have picked up the pace a little bit, I've come across the Tuatha (bad guys) only a handful of times and I feel like I can count on one hand the number of truly relevent things I have done. I understand this was meant to be a MMO but I feel like that kind of left us with the worst of both. As said there is a lot of good and bad to this game, I personally couldn't handle the running anymore, I had a lot of fun with the combat and the weapons, I loved that being a warrior mage meant my dodge roll changed to teleporting, I loved the idea of manipulating fate and how it was explained well and wasn't abused, but there's something to be said when no matter how much your run around the story just doesn't really seem to ever pick up.

												One of my favorite games of all-time.  It's a shame that the company was so horribly mismanaged that a sequel will probably never be made.  The state of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations has a large chunk of money tied up in the IP, and refuses to let go of it.Curt Shilling brought animator Todd MacFarlane together with master story writer R.A. Salvatore to create what I view as one of the greatest RPGs ever created.  If you can pick this one up on sale, definitely do.  It's pretty long and has some replay value as well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a very good game, with a lot of options. In fact, it's so big and deep that the game becomes overwhelming. It also gets repetitive very fast. Fighting enemies gets dull. You have a plethora of moves you can unlock as you level, but in the end, a short 3 hit combo, block hit and dodge are all you need to survive. Weapons like bows or two handed weapons become redundant once you can craft your own items with god tier gems. Daggers, with their speed are the only choice as all the enhancements are +X per hit, instead of scaled or % increases.Don't get me wrong, I LOVE this game and go back to it every so often. With an art design between Fable and WoW and a combat system reminiscent of Devil May Cry (minus the focus on strung out combos) it is incredibly fun for short bursts. The Combat is fun and takes a while to reach the repetitive droning that I stated earlier. There is a large variety of spells and skills, but weapons and armor are pretty much able to be maxed out just around halfway through the game. Note if you want a challenge, top tier regen gems and life/mana leech gems on weapons should be avoided. The only downside here is the lack of variety for enemies. Most enemies are beefed up/palette swapped versions of enemies you encounter early on. The world is huge, and the lore is pretty deep if you take the time to find it all. The Lorestones are impressive in their stories, and the bonuses they provide are generally useful. But there are TONS of Lorestones. Trying to find them all is tedious even after getting the upgrade that reveals EVERYTHING on the map. Which leads me to the last point: the Jack of all trades approach is not only good, but generally preferred in this game. The rewards at high levels in this game (where your classes are determined by which one you want to be and qualify for) are far above the high level rewards for any other classes, IMO.This game is a good play, but due to some repetitive (if fun) combat and quests, it only gets a solid 7 of 10 from me. You should play it, especially if it's cheap. But don't get obsessed with 100% completion.			",176,25,4,64,7,2,10

												Although I've played through pretty well the whole game (minus a little bit of DLC) I can't recommend this game.  While others say that all the side quests are great and add value to the game, all they were for me was make busy time to make the game feel long.  For example, towards the middle/end of the game there is a gnome city where to get the side quest you go to the very back corner of a house and then to finish the fetch quest you have to go the very back of another house and then of course go back to the quest giver to finish the quest.  There doesn't appear to be any sort of design choice for that other than making the quest take longer.  The amount of side quests also showed just how forgetable the main story quest was.  I don't recall much if any of the main quest because there would sometimes be hours and hours between times you did something related to the main story quest.As 'big' as this game is.  It feels empty.  Almost every area you go to is super similar.  You go to a new area, there will be one town or a larger city to get quests from, then there is a bunch of caves/tombs/ruins to fulfil those quests.  A lot of those caves/tombs/ruins all feel the same because you do the same thing in each.  You enter the side quest area at one end, go to the end of the area, finish your quest and then a new path opens up to send you back to the beginning.  As well each of these areas feel like copies of each other with different colour pallets.  Half of these areas could  have been removed and more time/focus spent on bigger and better side quests that actually felt rewarding.As well there is a serious problem with enemies in this game, as in, there is not near enough of them.  There appears to be a set of them and then a bunch of recolours or with a different weapon or something.  There was hardly an variety in the enemies making each area again feel like copies of previous areas.The one positive I'm going to give this game is the amount of lore they've packed into it.  If you complete all the side quests/faction quests and main quest you will have a lore overload and if thas your thing this game has it.			",213,33,0,39,14,2,28

Fast and Flashy Combat!Excellent RPG Game is a bit under Skyrim but games is very long to the main quest (~30h) and if you add the side quest, faction quest and all other there are very much hours of games. There are a few shortcomings. Like limited quicksaves, inability to name your saved game files the way you want, the camera can be very annoying, lip-syncing and a few quest bugs. They are however erased by the beauty of the world they created, the awesome visceral combat, the size of the world, the variety in the quests, the smoothness in the way the game runs.

It didnt suck enough to make me stop playing, it wasnt good enough for me to buy any of the DLC for it and want to continue the story. Speaking of the story it was alright, nothing spectacular. The combat wasnt bad and wasnt why i give this game a meh. I don't know why i give this game a meh but it just didnt wow me. I cant even decide if this game is worth recommending to buy on sale or not.straight 5/10, buy on sale if you have time to spare and have already played skyrim to death.			",158,13,9,40,34,2,63

												DISCLAMER: I have about 100 hours logged into the console version, so I think I know what I'm talking about.I hold the controversial opinion that maybe, just maybe, THERE ARE GAMES BETTER THAN SKYRIM. I also hold the opinion that this game is one of them.It does so many things better than Skyrim, and many other RPG's in general:Pros:-Fluid Combat that is just right. Everything flows so well, and it's not hard to control.-An engaging story. They had a proffesional fantasy writer, R.A. Salvatore, help them with the story , how could it not be legit?-A large world that you can easily be lost in.-The DLC has a good quality, providing a good 15-20 hours of gameplay per expansion, of which there are 2. They might as well be there own games.-Expansive Side-Quest lines that will take up most of your time.Cons:-The character models are...something.-Mediocre voice acting here and there, you'll be able to tell which accents are fake.The game and all of its DLC is $9.99 right now. There is literally no reason not to get this game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Story drags from one repetative quest to another. The real time combat system and gear system is wierd. For instance a stealther with a shield? Even a decent way into the game I find myself spamming the same attack combo over and over.EA also gives you buffed gear in the beginning, one set is themed after Sheapard from Mass Effect. IT is seriously overpowered, and will make you for a good part of the beginning of the game wonder why the game drops gear at all.I really want to like this game have tried it several times to try to get into it, but just cannot. It has great graphics and the main story is interesting, that is about where it ends.Lastly can we say EA account... why even allow the game on Steam if I have to have an EA Origin account to play?

												Tried various things to run this game. Initial startups were all stuck at first time setup runs and game got stuck at that window. Then i got it running after closing the process on third try, after playing around a bit i exited the game and my windows froze with black screen. Read forums and found its a compatibility issue, changed to windows xp, couldnt start game, changed to win 98 and ran it as admin game works fine....but really choppy on my i7 4790k with Gtx 980 and 16gb ram with dell gsync monitor it gives me 5fps at 2560X1440 resolution. The game itself looks interesting, but at this point i am giving up this affair....Dear Steam, when you sell games from the 18th Century on your platform, please ask lazy developers to make it playable on todays machines!!!!Why should anyone fiddle around so much to get something working which is a known issue on the forums since a long time...big thumbs down from me!

												Boring game. Little weapon variety, what weapons there are all have the same attacks, just press one attack button. Same monsters throughout the entire game, they just give them different names.  Main quest line is very boring and repetitive. Go into this castle and fight horde after horde of people to kill this boss, all while just pressing one button to attack               *yawn*. Feels like an MMO but it is single player so the whole world feels very empty and lonely and not fun to explore. If you go the rogue class good luck getting any gear. 14 hours of gameplay and i still had the starting gear they gave me in the tutorial because everything else was for casters or warriors.  Dont waste your money, even if its on sale			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This Game actually got me away from afghanistan for 50(+) hours...Yea while we had downtime i spent away logged roughly 50 hours of steam recorded gametime. (I played alot more offline)While this deployment was in 2014 and it is now 2016 i figured i'd give it a review. Though the game seemed slow at first when i first bought it. It was colorful. It reminded me of the old days of world of warcraft. Well the colors the graphics and thats about it. Set in a diffirent fantasy world this game help revive my love for RPG's. The game had an interesting story line. You actually died? hmm interesting. I was hoping i'd get to stay my zombie self for eternity but eventually you just become more and more human again it seemed. With some awesome powers to change peoples Fate. Overall the game is good but had a lot of bugs and wierd boss fights which were enjoyable. Wish there was faster combat but there wasnt. And how to end this review on a good note... well i guess it was more like a story a story of a fate of a man who got lost in tablet screen playing this game on his downtime in afghanistan.

												When I told a friend I had started playing Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning, he told/asked me two things.1) Do you like Fable?2) Welcome to babies first Skyrim.If you took fable (without all the fun) and it had sex with the Elder Scrolls Wiki, this is what you would have.This is far from a bad game! It is fun to be way overpowered (I played as a mage) and right from the gate you obliterate enemies left right and centre. This is good! It is exactly what I wanted from a game like this. It played well, smoothly and looks great in a very stylised fashion. What I didn't expect however is how DEEP and STEEPED this game is in lore. I can honestly say 90% of my play time (no joke) is reading and remembering characters/NPC's. I thought this was a little strange until I found out that Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning was originally intended as an MMO (something that I feel would have made for a totally different review!) and it changed how I played the game after that. I absorbed as much of the story as I needed and moved on in proper MMO style (and boy was I happier for it!) but it made for a hollow experience as it is (literally!) an MMO world and Lore with no other players...So what do I think of this? Your experience will vary. It is a fun but very lonely experience with a ton of very cool story that you can delve as deep into as you like. Is it tedious? Yes. Is it huge? Yes. Is it fun? Yes. Was it designed for single players? Not really.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The only thing I do not like is how random the loot system ca be. It's like my goodness!You can grab a helmet in the beginning of the game, and then 30 hours later grab the leg parts to this outfit, and that is very frustrating. Other than what i just mentioned, I truly enjoy playing this game.Some say the game can get repetitive, and then those same people will have played every Call of Duty game out there saying how the most recent one is sooooo amazing when in reality it's the same game with a different background and 2 more guns.So yes, it can be repetitve, but so is Naruto, and i've played so many of those games over and over again.Personally, I love this game.I play it on hard, and I only use the slow Health and Mana regens,and it makes this game very hard and very strategical. I recommend picking it up and giving it a go.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of my favourite games of all time. Hundreds of hours out into the ps3 version. Now playing the even better pc version. A must buy. just bought the DLC (teeth of naros, legend of dead kel) and it adds a significant amount of hours of gameplay. you'd be a fool not to purchase this on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tried various things to run this game. Initial startups were all stuck at first time setup runs and game got stuck at that window. Then i got it running after closing the process on third try, after playing around a bit i exited the game and my windows froze with black screen. Read forums and found its a compatibility issue, changed to windows xp, couldnt start game, changed to win 98 and ran it as admin game works fine....but really choppy on my i7 4790k with Gtx 980 and 16gb ram with dell gsync monitor it gives me 5fps at 2560X1440 resolution. The game itself looks interesting, but at this point i am giving up this affair....Dear Steam, when you sell games from the 18th Century on your platform, please ask lazy developers to make it playable on todays machines!!!!Why should anyone fiddle around so much to get something working which is a known issue on the forums since a long time...big thumbs down from me!

												Fun, but too long.  You're not fixed into a specific character class like a lot of other RPGs, and you can build your character to fit your playstyle.  As the lucky one who's immune to fate, it is up to you to complete dozens and dozens of side quests because Bob is trapped by fate to be unable to get off his barstool to give a letter to Tim who's sitting at a table on the other side of the tavern.  I imagine if you didn't do all the sidequests, you might be able to remember why you are slaughtering your way across the land.  There is lots of gear to be found, but once you get a set, you find yourself keeping it for large parts of the game due to the set bonuses.  Occasionally with the combo system you end up just being dragged around by your sword.  Occasionally you will get NPCs to help you, but they are only to hold aggro as they do no damage and seem to be invulnerable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I like this game, I do, but it's not really, truly an RPG.  The action elements are simplified as they would be in an RPG.  There are options for weapons, armors, skills, etc. as there would be in an RPG.  However, the game storyline plays more like a bland and unenriching adventure game.  To me, it feels as if the entire game was built around a showy, fairly easy combat core engine/concept.  That definitely does not make it a bad game, it's not, hence my first sentence clarification that I do like it and recommend it.  But, it's more mindless fun than an RPG should be, and doesn't leave the fullness of story flavor even an adventure game would.

												Well, this one is quite a hard one for me. For starters, it was a blast, like discovering a jewel that has been sitting in front of you all of the time without you noticing it. I was like, ""Why didn't I know this game did exist at all?"" And so I was really hooked to it for a couple of hours. A couple of dozens of hours. A really pretty game. Big and stable (at least for me). WIth a funny and fluent combat system (I would dare to say in the likes of Dark Souls, Darksiders or Blade: Edge of Darkness (things tend to get dark when combat systems are cool, it seems)). With a slightly original setting from your usual fantasy RPG and inmersive too. Decent crafting, voice acting and music...But then it started to feel a bit shallow. As if you were playing an MMOPRG, but without the social interaction. Quests started to feel repetitive, the NPCs less charming, the story not that interesting. Everything was a bit of a chore. Worst of all, I felt no challenge at all. Even when the combat felt right and was funny, this has to be the ONE game for me in which I NEVER died. Not once. In the whole of the game. Not a single failed combat situation, and let me tell you it is a long way to complete it. I know there are roundabouts for this (both patches and even set paths to keep you a wimp for the whole of the main story around the web), but this is clearly not right.So, at the end, I wouldn't recommend it. It gave me plenty of hours of enjoyemet a the star, but left me empty and a bit angry by the mid-end game.  If you can get it on sale (not very often, I think) go for it, but else, I wouldn't do so.Cheers,			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Kindoms of Amalur: Recckoning is a mix between Fable and skyrim, and who wouldnt like that? Kindoms of Amalur has a great combat system, and the weapons and armor make you feel like the badass like you should in any RPG, and the great part is that you dont have to be a high level to feel like a badass, at level 4 i fealt so powerful until i died. In Kindoms of Amalur you can mix all classes in the game around to you're liking, an example would be a mage knight, combining swordsman ship with magic to make you feal over powered. Kindoms of Amalur has alot of quests and will take you a while to complete all of them. The map in Kindoms of Amalur isnt so great, you can explore, but the map loads for each section which isnt bad, but it feels linear. The main story quest is a bit boring at times, but its not all bad. When you talk to people there may be someone hurt thats moaning in the backround while you talk which is really weird sometimes. The game is great so if youre thinking about getting get it, and if it goes on sale its a steal but its worth what it costs on steam.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an ARPG with a world that feels like it was built for an MMO, which is why it comes as such a surprise how deep and polished the narrative is. This title is really a hidden gem, with a fairy-tale story that sucks you into the enormous game world. The landscapes are varied and become increasingly fantastical as the game goes on. This is one of the small handful of games where you can play a for over a hundred hours without spending any of that time on filler content.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Made even more interesting with the card system, giving further specialisation options depending on how you distribute your skills in the 3 skill trees.Combat itself has a great flow, and experimenting with different combos is a lot of fun. And The finisher move animations from the reckoning mode are varied enough, so I never tire of seeing them.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love this game. Extreme skill customisation ftw. Be a mage! Be a rogue! Be a warrior! Be all of them at once! Made even more interesting with the card system, giving further specialisation options depending on how you distribute your skills in the 3 skill trees.Combat itself has a great flow, and experimenting with different combos is a lot of fun. And The finisher move animations from the reckoning mode are varied enough, so I never tire of seeing them.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												-Did not keep my attention for long-World feels enclosed/empty and superficial (like playing in a giant bowl)-Combat-oriented; inappropriate/out of place hack-n-slash combat system for an RPG -Felt reminiscent to a mediocre MMORPG without all the players (shallow quests, for instance)+appealing visuals and aesthetics +despite combat system feeling out of place, it is rather satisfying+skill trees presented cool abilities and freedom of playstyle; you do not have to spend points on a single tree to benefitFinal Verdict: I want my $5 back.

												Kindoms of Amalur: Recckoning is a mix between Fable and skyrim, and who wouldnt like that? Kindoms of Amalur has a great combat system, and the weapons and armor make you feel like the badass like you should in any RPG, and the great part is that you dont have to be a high level to feel like a badass, at level 4 i fealt so powerful until i died. In Kindoms of Amalur you can mix all classes in the game around to you're liking, an example would be a mage knight, combining swordsman ship with magic to make you feal over powered. Kindoms of Amalur has alot of quests and will take you a while to complete all of them. The map in Kindoms of Amalur isnt so great, you can explore, but the map loads for each section which isnt bad, but it feels linear. The main story quest is a bit boring at times, but its not all bad. When you talk to people there may be someone hurt thats moaning in the backround while you talk which is really weird sometimes. The game is great so if youre thinking about getting get it, and if it goes on sale its a steal but its worth what it costs on steam.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First impressions were not positive.-World of Warcraft is a strong influence.  The narrative, visuals & voice acting are boilerplate.  If you've played WoW you already know how the story will be told and what it will look & sound like, right down to the elves & gnomes.-The combat system is derived from God of War, perhaps?  It works well for melee combat, but casting and archery are relegated to auto-targeting and feel dull.  -All player characters are male.-The menus are awkward; lots of decending and ascending through menu-after-sub-menu with little aesthetic flare.  -The much maligned quick-time event also makes an appearance.  I ignored it, but my character still produced a gigantic spear of pure light which he proceeded to plunge through his adversary' s face.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Every review is positive here, so im going to bring up the bad stuff about this game, and what other games does better.Where do I start?Your character is glued to the ground to start with. You cannot jump. The map is big, but because of the glued to the ground issue, and the way they built the enviroment, its tedious as **** to walk around in the world. Rocks, tree-roots, rivers and small valleys. Walk around and find the way down/over/around. Tedious. Also, the only way to ""jump"" down a valley or such, is to find a small wooden ramp. Then you press F and the character jumps down. The height of these will blow your mind. The world itself is big. Not HUUUUGE like the other wants you to think. Its not a free world like gta or skyrim, you go where they want you to go. Monsters/enemies. They are not very varied. Same stuff to kill over and over. (Fighting/combat is fun however so its 50/50)Reused textures/enviroments. Makes me angry, this♥♥♥♥♥♥right here. The caves that exists everywhere all look alike. Small differences but still big sections are the same everywhere. Kinda ruins the feeling.Leveling up is fine, so is the weapons dmg, types and so on.This game has nothing that skyrim doesn't do better. Looting and taking everything in the chest, you have to use the mouse to press ""take all"". And you loot a lot, A LOT. So small irratating things like these are everywhere.Fighting upphill? To bad, if you have ranged weapons/magic they will go straight forward, into the ground.  Story is ok. Good concept, poorly executed.PROS: Combat feels nice and looks good, WOW style. Big enemies, bosses and such are really fun to fight.CONS: The game is EASY. Im playin on hard right now and it feels like easy. This game has nothing on other games in the same genré.Conclusion: Save your money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Spent a long time playing this game and I just keep coming back to the same issue: I almost like it. Almost.Combat is fun, graphics work well but the story is completly unengaging. Fun combat and no story does not an RPG make. Sooner or later the shine wears off the combat and you're left with no real reason to complete the game. Shame really.			",172,71,1,81,15,0,61

												To clarify, the GAME is fun, and I would recommend it. The DLC **DO NOT BUY**. There are a lot of little bugs and glitches, and all of them can be overlooked....except for a few. Which will literally end your time playing on that character. The Dead-Kel expansion was what stopped me. After defeating him, my companion spawned dead next to him, and remained dead when escaping the tunnel where there are 2 cave-ins which the companion gets teleported imbetween before coming to a dead-end beach. The idea is, your companion will be teleported to that spot so they don't get too far behind and will follow you onto the beach where you will be teleported out after speaking with them. Sadly, if your companion is dead, and you don't have multiple save spots, your game simply ends here. If your companion is stuck but alive, there's an exploit you can do which will cause it to get ""un-stuck"" and you can hopefully continue with your game. The game is insanely easy, even on Hard difficulty. Once you get a set-piece with +1hp regen, you'll almost never need to use a potion ever again. It's just sad, that I couldn't play it through just to see the story and was cut short due to a horrible game design. The company is disbanded and won't be patching a fix for it, so I'll save you the time now, and tell you to just keep moving along and find another game. Or don't play any of the DLC's.....or....have a lot of different saves because you'll never know how far back you'll need to restart to compensate for bugs.			",98,8,4,9,7,0,4

												 Boring, slow, clunky, and obviously something it was never meant to be. This was not meant to be a single player RPG, it was meant to be an MMORPG, and not even a good one, and not even for the PC. No MMO on the PC has this poor of an interface, this strange of movement, and this bad of an economy. Crafting and gold don’t scale fast enough to match shop prices, so don’t expect to buy more than one piece of gear when you go into town. Ultimately, my biggest issue is that the areas are so narrow. Compare to all MMOs, and you will find the every zone ringed by hills, most of which cannot be scaled. The difference is that, until a zone transitions, they are far away. If you stand in the center, you will need to walk a good distance to reach the cliffs. The walk from the middle to the edge is less than the distance to my bookcase. Boring, poorly made, and poorly adapted. Shameful waste of the 5 bucks I spent on it.			",55,6,0,14,3,0,15

												I could describe this game in one word: repetive.  At first, the game looks awesome! The colors, the gameplay, the huge♥♥♥♥♥world (wicht really is gigantic), the epic quest your doing and the huge amount of quest you can do, all of it seems great.  But unfortunately, after awhile, you start to realize that a lot of the quests are the same.  Also, they are always taking you to really far away places, which could be nice for exploration but it's not, because every time you walk 2 yards, a horde of monstres attack you, making travels really long and boring.  I haven't played the hole story line and I only have 8 hours of gameplay but I definitally don't recommend this game as you lose interest of it really fast.

												Yes, the combat is exciting and dynamic.Yes, this game has a huge number of loots... andYes, this game tons of side quests.Yes, the world is large - OK, the world is gorgeous.However, despite sinking numerous hours into this game, you'll still find this game somewhat lacking. It has a very uninteresting story. Quests, both main and side, are highly repetitive. I mean, hell - Diablo does have an even more boring story (it doesn't really have one, right?) but I feel a different kind of boredom playing this game - possibly due to the huge world, or samey environment everywhere.By all means, get this game if you like the flashy combat experience (as said above, it has a decent combat system). But don't expect it to be anything interesting outside of combat. And don't even compare this game to Skyrim, where the world is much more dynamic.			",105,22,5,19,11,0,25

												I really wanted to like this game and while I enjoyed the first quarter of it, the game quickly became lackluster. There was so much potential staring me right in the face but the lack of polish and variety ultimately made for a rather boring experience. Numerous times through the game I couldn't help but think that the producers, having probably spent a large portion of the budget to bring in McFarlane for concept art; Salvatore for story writing; and voice actors for all of the dialog, were demanding unrealistic publish dates that forced the developers into a tough position.  The world wasn't immersive enough, the combat encounters were way too repetative due to painfully small monster variety, the itemization was awful... during the last quarter of the game I stopped openning chests and looting bodies completely because I never found upgrades anyway, and the level design felt unnecessarily drawn out or repetative in many ways.Ultimately, this game shows that a lot of quality work went into conceiving a game that would have been amazing to play, deeply immersive, and with many novel concepts, but somewhere in the process of development a line was drawn and deep concessions were made. Evidence that the games' potential was never realized is staring you in the face from start to finish. It is a shame really.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The graphics are kind of cartoony which makes them look out of date. The quests get repetitive really fast (kill this, fetch that). The skill trees are OK, but they have been done in similar ways sooo many times. The cutscenes are poor because the characters just stand there. And sometimes background sounds interfere with the cutscenes - e.g. a wounded woman was moaning like she was in a porno so loud at the first cutscene that I was barely able to hear what was being said. I mean come on, if you can't patch such simple things, then forget it. It really does not help with the story that is bland anyway. To sum up - as many reviewers here mentioned before, this game is just so mediocre and uninspiring in every way. It's like a boring offline MMO. Nothing stands out, everything has been done before here or there and many times in a better way. I really tried to like this game but I just got so bored so fast.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My first reaction to the game was: Graphics weren't what I was expecting, polished combat and extremely well made. But I quickly felt like there was something missing in this game. Something uncoherently mistaking. The combat feels really arcade as do the graphics but besides that there is areally polished RPG factor in it. You might say: that would be a positive thing. But I can't help but feel it does not match well together. Atleast for me it does not. The way I see it Kingdoms of Amalur is quite a big game, not seamingless, more like zones connected to each other. But the bland quests, not really appealing story and on the other hand good looks and superb combat makes me feel like I can't land my feet and immerse in the game.			",17,3,0,6,0,0,1

												Many people will make the mistake of playing this game like a single-player experience.  They will try to be completionists, working to finish every quest they can find.Unfortunately, this game plays more like an MMO, which is to say there is far more content than you can hope to complete before you become over-leveled.This also means, however, that you often can't tell the difference between a quickie one-shot quest that takes ten minutes to complete and a six-part branching quest chain that ends in a fantastic and unique reward you'll be grateful to have.Play the game through with a guide if you want to get the most bang for your buck.  Otherwise, play it casually.  I don't think there's a medium to be discovered that could be considered entertaining.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Kingdoms of Amalur is what an MMO would be like without other players.  Want to wander through cavernous environments rife with fetch quests?  Do you enjoy immersion breaking question-marked quest givers?  How about a bland story that tries very hard get you interested in 10,000 years of lore without providing an modern (within the game context) relevance?  Those are the features of KOA that you'll encounter.  The combat is interesting and refreshing for an action-RPG but that doesn't make a good game nor does it draw me in to the world.  After 15 hours or so I found myself playing this game like Diablo, micro-managing stats and largely ignoring the talky parts.  That would be fine if KOA didn't try so hard to convince you its story is worth knowing.  This is a game built on the words of RA Salvatore, how it failed to tell a story is beyond me. Pros: Frequently on sale, CombatCons: Story, MMO-like mechanics without multiplayer, Abuse of the word RPG, Fetch Quests, Throw-away mobs. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It feels like an attempt at an action MMORPG where they ran out of time to complete the networking so they just released it anyway as a singleplayer game. The combat is mediocre at best with no depth so it gets repetitive, requiring you to spend hours levelling before you can begin to do anything slightly diverse. It feels kind of unresponsive because some animations for attacks take so long and you can't even dodge-cancel out of them. The world is really big and beautiful though but ultimately meaningless without good gameplay. The camera is also really close, so close it's almost nauseating.			",132,26,2,9,8,3,5

												A sort of hybrid of Fable and Skyrim, Amalur suffers because of its unoriginality.  In the end, why play it?  If you are looking for a skyrim-alike game, play that instead.  Miss Fables?  Play the original, for it is still the best.  Competently made and largely free of graphical or gameplay glitches, Amalur suffers from the greatest sin a video game can commit: it is boring.

												If you are expecting to use an Xbox controller with this game you are mistaken until EA or Big Huge fixes the mapping it is unplayable. You would think that this being a released on console they would have got it right on PC but as it is now it is currently unplayable with the 360 Controller. KB&M work fine but this game was made for a controller, a controller that you cannot use because 1 button is mapped to 7 different actions and cannot be remapped. Makes using a 360 controller impossible. No fix on the any of the forums either..... If you want to play with KB&M go for it might be a good game but if you might ever want to use a controller save your money it’s unplayable			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, I played this game for at least 38h now, which is not very much compared to some other ones I played. But the difference is: To play this game feels more like work than fun to me.I know, the points I'll criticize are very subjective, but that's the thing with critics, so no offense to the ones who love this game, it just doesn't seem to be my style. ;)Story/Quests: Ähem. First a confession: I didn't finish it. Yeah. Sorry. It was just not interesting enough. There are epic bossfights, a very, very evil overlord, a war and you as - of course - the chosen one. At least everything you need for a high-fantasy RPG.NPC's are exchangeable all over the place, I cannot even remember a single name. Much less their background. The main Quests are okay, the ""guild""-Quests also, the rest is too often just filler (Kill X to get Y and bring it to Z), nothing memorable.World/Graphic:It's colorful. Very colorful. So colorful that I cannot take this game as serious as it wants to be. All this quirky, comic-like fairy-stuff... I mean, even the supposed ""Dark"" areas are kinda sweet! The Graphics themselves are okay, not state of the art, but it's a game from 2012, so - oh, wait... 2012? ... Yeah, they could have done it better then. But it's still not 'bad', just 'okay'. The map is gigantic and you are free to walk where you want. Unless you walk against a rock. Or against any other obstacle on your path. Even if it's just waist-high. And that upsets me every time in every game!But the music is lovely! Fighting/Level System:The Action is nice, there are a lot of cool moves you can do, some really powerful spells and techniques. All combined, it makes quite fun to slay all that monsters. And if you are as bored as me by the story (but still not bored enough to quit yet), you might also regard the looting and levelling as your last source of long-term motivation.Also the game has a cool crafting-system, it's diversive and sometimes useful at the same time!RPG really is my genre of choice, but it seems that I'm not a colorful, very-high-fantasy kind of player...I really gave it many chances to thrill me, but the atmosphere, the story, the character - all that failed to thrill me.

												One of the best, despite being the easiest, RPGs I've ever come across. The combat system is basic and refined, it's not as twitchy as most other Action RPGs because it still requires a proper strategy when engaging enemies. The graphics are great, not too overtly realistic yet it's not as cartoony. Kinda reminds me of World of Warcraft, and for that it kinda makes me sad. Because I miss WoW.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Asides from the crappy EA usual♥♥♥♥♥♥ I love this game with my very heart, and think it's one of the most underrated rpgs of all time. The flexible character builds are amazing and combat is fluid with each enemy varying completely from another. Yes, the main story doesn't have much immersiveness in it but the thing about KOA that is special is the amount of side quests, some of which are pretty damn intresting and others that are less interesting but fun as hell still. Idk why people gripe about the voice acting in this game, really hypocritical considering many of the voice actors are from SKYRIM, the so called 'valhalla' of rpgs. The voice acting is not bad at all, not the best, but definitely bearable. All in all really good game for someone who's willing to spend time on it. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At first the game seemed to be fun. It was fun trying out different builds, character looks, weapons and magic. The quests were fun as well, in the beginning that is. But the fun pretty much stopped when I realised that the quest are all the same ""we have a problem, please do that and that"" - so tedious and unimaginitive and boring. I mean the quest in Skyrim are so much better and IMMERSIVE. So combat system becomes a drag and a total bore after you get to Ysa (that how it was for me) and the difficulty is disheartening. I played on hard, yet it was a stroll. Boring. Don't mean to spoil the ending, but it was so ******* stupid and dull. The whole game feels so scripted you can't feel yourself immersed in the world of Amalur. 3/10			",59,7,3,17,5,0,30

												This game is overly long with way too many areas and quests for such a non-epic storyline. The art style just didn't seem to mesh with a narrative written by R. A. Salvatore. Combat was repetitive and boring as well with boss fights that weren't memorable...seriously, I can't describe a single boss sequence from this game, and I played it from start to finish and completed all quests in each area (I really shouldn't have wasted my time on that). Yeah, this game does a great job to suck you in, but it's about as addictive as World of Warcraft but without the payoff.			",53,7,0,11,0,0,2

												Kindoms of Amalur: Recckoning is a mix between Fable and skyrim, and who wouldnt like that? Kindoms of Amalur has a great combat system, and the weapons and armor make you feel like the badass like you should in any RPG, and the great part is that you dont have to be a high level to feel like a badass, at level 4 i fealt so powerful until i died. In Kindoms of Amalur you can mix all classes in the game around to you're liking, an example would be a mage knight, combining swordsman ship with magic to make you feal over powered. Kindoms of Amalur has alot of quests and will take you a while to complete all of them. The map in Kindoms of Amalur isnt so great, you can explore, but the map loads for each section which isnt bad, but it feels linear. The main story quest is a bit boring at times, but its not all bad. When you talk to people there may be someone hurt thats moaning in the backround while you talk which is really weird sometimes. The game is great so if youre thinking about getting get it, and if it goes on sale its a steal but its worth what it costs on steam.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I do enjoy the game, and I think it is a good way to quench your thirst for a game of this style. With more work this game could have really been amazing. An active modding community would even be plenly enough to save it. But sadly we will not be seeing any more progress on it.I suck at adding pros so i'll just be going into the details on the cons. (sorry if i am a bit too harsh)Worth the purchase?   I would say the game is worth a buy when it is on sale, or if you are like me and don't have a pc able to run things like The Witcher 3 or Shadow of Mordor.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+ Overall fun gameplay and combat. Easy to get into and can find a good amount of things to do.+ The main story is pretty good. Really new and interesting plot.+ The respec system allows you to completely change your playstyle at any point for a small fee of gold.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- Poor difficulty scaling.   Apparently when you enter a new area, it locks that area to your current level. So if you progress too fast or, like me, end up charging across the map in search of a challenge, the whole game becomes a cakewalk. (besides a few special enemies that do stupidly high damage compared to the rest)   I have heard that this also works for chests, so looting everything too early will hurt you in the end.- Conversations seem to be lacking. Persuasion skill is useless.   I quickly found myself skipping through dialogue to reach choices to get past it, that often make no difference besides the next line the npc says. I even tried to make a few npcs hate me but nothing happened. (And apparently I am now lovers with some girl even though all I did was use her boat.)   The Persuasion skill, having 10 whole ranks, only affects the chance for you to succeed in rare, often pointless dialogue options, that you could just pass by quicksaving/loading. There are also a couple milestones in it, but all they do is slightly lower the cost of bribes for crimes.- Equipment.   Many people say that upgrading your blacksmithing skill makes getting good gear too easy, but it seemed like the opposite for me. With max rank blacksmithing i only ever made a few items worth using since I could never find good materials , and ended up just selling all of my loot and purchasing better gear from shops.   Armor sets just stink. I have done a lot of exploring and looting but have never found more than 2 parts of a set besides when given to me. And even if I had, my gear would still be far better. Same story for most of the special weapons I get.- Side quests are annoying.   There are a few I have done that I found interesting and enjoyable, but mostly it just became a case of skipping through, accepting everything, just doing them as I went to an area with an objective there.   This could also just be because I have played too many mmoprgs.- Not enough variety in enemies.   Throughout the game you will be finding the same enemies even in far different settings, such as trolls, spiders, and pretty much any people. Even being in different reigons and factions, they will have the same attacks and skills.- Plenty of annoying bugs and things that could do with improvement.   I have had quests break multiple times, even once before causing me to have to start a whole new game.   When you disable an enemy in reckoning mode, your character will still try to target them.   And many more little issues...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really disappointing game. Takes two great game series -- Elder Scrolls and Dragon Age -- and perversely combines their negatives (from the former, an unvoiced player character traveling alone; from the latter, a world of constrained spaces and absurd, occasionally degrading character design), in the service of a plot that just isn't all that engaging. Combat mechanics are somewhat interesting; they're the only part of the game that is, and they can't rescue some of the combat encounters from being entirely too lengthy, tedious and occasionally frustrating. After about 30 hours, I got bored with the story and the world and stopped playing.			",23,20,0,8,3,0,7

												An ok adventure game. Feels kinda like an MMO, but single player... by that I mean it has a lot of 'fetch this meaningless crap for me.' Most quests are entirely forgettable. The game also masquerades as an RPG, with experience and levels and better gear and all that. Until you realize that all the zones scale up to you. So did you complete tons of quests and work really hard on getting awesome gear? Too bad cause the next zone is scaled up to your level so it doesn't mean jack.In short this game commits many gaming sins, introduces nothing new, has a subpar story, and lackluster gameplay.

												The core game is average but, worth playing if you get this game on sale.  My biggest issues are that I feel lonely when I roam this sort of 'realistic' world and it feels like an MMO that was changed last minute to a single-player experience. Some Warnings - There is no cooperative play on this game and you must always be online (connected to EA servers) to play this single player experience.			",291,33,11,37,9,0,26

												I didn't like it. Basically, you can't jump and there are no objects in the game world, just containers; it's that sort of game. Don't get me wrong, the textures, lighting, character design, voices, buildings, weapons and world are OK, maybe 10 years ago I'd be really impressed with this game. However it just doesn't cut it after Skyrim, it's not even better then Oblivion or Gothic 2. To me, it's just not 'open world' unless you can jump and look around the back of the cave for a few elusive coins. Shame, because it looks like a nice world and it's obviously had a lot of thought put into it but the gameplay too generic, paint by numbers and boring. This is to RPG what Zelda is to AD&D			",54,9,0,19,18,0,33

												The combat is fun. Unfortunately: The world does not feel open enough for an open-world RPG, and the NPCs are not interesting enough for a story-directed RPG. I normally do all the side-quests in an RPG, and in this game there are just so many that they burnt me out. The overarching story is embarrassingly generic. About a third into the game, loot drops become useless; crafting, on the other hand, is overpowered. Feels too much like it was over-simplified for consoles. No support or updates to fix issues.

												Really got into this game wanted to beat it then I got a stupid ward chest that cursed me and I had to go back to town to get cured. After not understanding how to open these chests and then getting cursed again and going back to town again. It was just something that just didn’t make the game fun anymore.  Yes I could go online and find the trick to beat the ward chest but I shouldn’t have to. Bad decision to put the ward chest in couldn’t recommend this game because of the stupid ward chests.

												The world of Amalur is amazing, but I honestly have a hard time recommending this game. There's great depth to the world and plenty to do, but overall it ends up being very, very repetitive. Amalur just doesn't hold up to the other action RPG juggernauts like Skyrim and Fallout 3, for example. It's not that this was a bad game, but it really didn't stand out and I have a hard time recommending it unless you have time to burn.			",176,62,1,28,5,1,22

												This game is very, very boring. It ""borrows"" many different elements from different games, without executing them properly. Combat: Animation is good. That's all that's good to say about it. The dodge mechanic is♥♥♥♥♥♥ combat works like a character action game like God of War, but unlike god of war the dodge is unresponsive, the combat slow, and, while visually awesome, attacking enemies just doesn't have the impact one might have expected from the effort they've put into animating the attack sequence. Camera angle is terrible. It's very difficult to see where the enemies are coming from. Stealth is broken. It doesn't work beyond tutorial level. Enemy AI lacks any ... how should i put it.... meat on them: they are very generic and lack variety to the point it might have been better if they were all just hitboxes painted dull grey. Story/Lore: I really can't give a single f*ck what the story is about. The dialogues are dry with terrible voice acting that makes the world very unconvincing. it's very hard to feel any connection to anything, including the character you've created yourself. NPCs are so forgettable they all just blend into the same boringness in which i can't tell the differences between any of them.Overall experience: Bored. I gave it 2 chances. I've deleted it once then reintalled that again, thinking that giving up so early on is a mistake. That decision turned out to be a mistake itself. 3/10			",89,17,0,14,14,0,3

												Horrible fighting system and all the actions that matter you can't remap the keys making it so that anything you would normally use in that position is not there and in some inconvenient spot. Biggest problem is with the fighting system though. They can break your set of moves but you can't break theirs... and anything they do during combat stops you but you never seem to be able to stop them... huh... What the friggin' crap is that? I was told this was just as good as Skyrim... this sucks... I recommend Skyrim though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												KoA is... a fantasy game. Pretty standard stuff. Too standard.Maybe it is just me... I mean, I've loved the fantasy genre for most of my life. But I'm getting older, and these days, for a fantasy game to really grab a hold of me, it really has to stand out - to be unique and original - to contain at least some aspect that every other fantasy game hasn't already beaten into the ground.I didn't see anything original or unique in KoA. I admit I only played it for half a dozen hours... but I think I played for long enough that, if it were going to grab me, it should have by then. And it didn't.Combat was okay, but it felt pretty generic. Just like everything else about the gameplay, story and characters.I hate to be so harsh; I'm sure there are other fantasy fans out there who would probably enjoy this. But at this point in my gaming life, I'm looking for a new spin on fantasy. Games like Dark Souls that approach fantasy from a whole new angle and aesthetic. I'm getting really sick of elves and orcs and epic battles against ancient evils where the world always hangs in the balance and it's always clear who the hero is (usually you).If you want another fantasy game like all the others you've played (and there's nothing wrong with that) - KoA could be for you. It was not for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First impressions were not positive.-World of Warcraft is a strong influence.  The narrative, visuals & voice acting are boilerplate.  If you've played WoW you already know how the story will be told and what it will look & sound like, right down to the elves & gnomes.-The combat system is derived from God of War, perhaps?  It works well for melee combat, but casting and archery are relegated to auto-targeting and feel dull.  -All player characters are male.-The menus are awkward; lots of decending and ascending through menu-after-sub-menu with little aesthetic flare.  -The much maligned quick-time event also makes an appearance.  I ignored it, but my character still produced a gigantic spear of pure light which he proceeded to plunge through his adversary' s face.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Every review is positive here, so im going to bring up the bad stuff about this game, and what other games does better.Where do I start?Your character is glued to the ground to start with. You cannot jump. The map is big, but because of the glued to the ground issue, and the way they built the enviroment, its tedious as **** to walk around in the world. Rocks, tree-roots, rivers and small valleys. Walk around and find the way down/over/around. Tedious. Also, the only way to ""jump"" down a valley or such, is to find a small wooden ramp. Then you press F and the character jumps down. The height of these will blow your mind. The world itself is big. Not HUUUUGE like the other wants you to think. Its not a free world like gta or skyrim, you go where they want you to go. Monsters/enemies. They are not very varied. Same stuff to kill over and over. (Fighting/combat is fun however so its 50/50)Reused textures/enviroments. Makes me angry, this♥♥♥♥♥♥right here. The caves that exists everywhere all look alike. Small differences but still big sections are the same everywhere. Kinda ruins the feeling.Leveling up is fine, so is the weapons dmg, types and so on.This game has nothing that skyrim doesn't do better. Looting and taking everything in the chest, you have to use the mouse to press ""take all"". And you loot a lot, A LOT. So small irratating things like these are everywhere.Fighting upphill? To bad, if you have ranged weapons/magic they will go straight forward, into the ground.  Story is ok. Good concept, poorly executed.PROS: Combat feels nice and looks good, WOW style. Big enemies, bosses and such are really fun to fight.CONS: The game is EASY. Im playin on hard right now and it feels like easy. This game has nothing on other games in the same genré.Conclusion: Save your money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To clarify, the GAME is fun, and I would recommend it. The DLC **DO NOT BUY**. There are a lot of little bugs and glitches, and all of them can be overlooked....except for a few. Which will literally end your time playing on that character. The Dead-Kel expansion was what stopped me. After defeating him, my companion spawned dead next to him, and remained dead when escaping the tunnel where there are 2 cave-ins which the companion gets teleported imbetween before coming to a dead-end beach. The idea is, your companion will be teleported to that spot so they don't get too far behind and will follow you onto the beach where you will be teleported out after speaking with them. Sadly, if your companion is dead, and you don't have multiple save spots, your game simply ends here. If your companion is stuck but alive, there's an exploit you can do which will cause it to get ""un-stuck"" and you can hopefully continue with your game. The game is insanely easy, even on Hard difficulty. Once you get a set-piece with +1hp regen, you'll almost never need to use a potion ever again. It's just sad, that I couldn't play it through just to see the story and was cut short due to a horrible game design. The company is disbanded and won't be patching a fix for it, so I'll save you the time now, and tell you to just keep moving along and find another game. Or don't play any of the DLC's.....or....have a lot of different saves because you'll never know how far back you'll need to restart to compensate for bugs.			",98,8,4,9,7,0,4

												 Boring, slow, clunky, and obviously something it was never meant to be. This was not meant to be a single player RPG, it was meant to be an MMORPG, and not even a good one, and not even for the PC. No MMO on the PC has this poor of an interface, this strange of movement, and this bad of an economy. Crafting and gold don’t scale fast enough to match shop prices, so don’t expect to buy more than one piece of gear when you go into town. Ultimately, my biggest issue is that the areas are so narrow. Compare to all MMOs, and you will find the every zone ringed by hills, most of which cannot be scaled. The difference is that, until a zone transitions, they are far away. If you stand in the center, you will need to walk a good distance to reach the cliffs. The walk from the middle to the edge is less than the distance to my bookcase. Boring, poorly made, and poorly adapted. Shameful waste of the 5 bucks I spent on it.			",55,6,0,14,3,0,15

												It feels like an attempt at an action MMORPG where they ran out of time to complete the networking so they just released it anyway as a singleplayer game. The combat is mediocre at best with no depth so it gets repetitive, requiring you to spend hours levelling before you can begin to do anything slightly diverse. It feels kind of unresponsive because some animations for attacks take so long and you can't even dodge-cancel out of them. The world is really big and beautiful though but ultimately meaningless without good gameplay. The camera is also really close, so close it's almost nauseating.			",132,26,2,9,8,3,5

												Kingdoms of Amalur is what an MMO would be like without other players.  Want to wander through cavernous environments rife with fetch quests?  Do you enjoy immersion breaking question-marked quest givers?  How about a bland story that tries very hard get you interested in 10,000 years of lore without providing an modern (within the game context) relevance?  Those are the features of KOA that you'll encounter.  The combat is interesting and refreshing for an action-RPG but that doesn't make a good game nor does it draw me in to the world.  After 15 hours or so I found myself playing this game like Diablo, micro-managing stats and largely ignoring the talky parts.  That would be fine if KOA didn't try so hard to convince you its story is worth knowing.  This is a game built on the words of RA Salvatore, how it failed to tell a story is beyond me. Pros: Frequently on sale, CombatCons: Story, MMO-like mechanics without multiplayer, Abuse of the word RPG, Fetch Quests, Throw-away mobs. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you are expecting to use an Xbox controller with this game you are mistaken until EA or Big Huge fixes the mapping it is unplayable. You would think that this being a released on console they would have got it right on PC but as it is now it is currently unplayable with the 360 Controller. KB&M work fine but this game was made for a controller, a controller that you cannot use because 1 button is mapped to 7 different actions and cannot be remapped. Makes using a 360 controller impossible. No fix on the any of the forums either..... If you want to play with KB&M go for it might be a good game but if you might ever want to use a controller save your money it’s unplayable			",114,23,0,44,14,0,43

												Really disappointing game. Takes two great game series -- Elder Scrolls and Dragon Age -- and perversely combines their negatives (from the former, an unvoiced player character traveling alone; from the latter, a world of constrained spaces and absurd, occasionally degrading character design), in the service of a plot that just isn't all that engaging. Combat mechanics are somewhat interesting; they're the only part of the game that is, and they can't rescue some of the combat encounters from being entirely too lengthy, tedious and occasionally frustrating. After about 30 hours, I got bored with the story and the world and stopped playing.			",23,20,0,8,3,0,7

												A sort of hybrid of Fable and Skyrim, Amalur suffers because of its unoriginality.  In the end, why play it?  If you are looking for a skyrim-alike game, play that instead.  Miss Fables?  Play the original, for it is still the best.  Competently made and largely free of graphical or gameplay glitches, Amalur suffers from the greatest sin a video game can commit: it is boring.

												Well, I played this game for at least 38h now, which is not very much compared to some other ones I played. But the difference is: To play this game feels more like work than fun to me.I know, the points I'll criticize are very subjective, but that's the thing with critics, so no offense to the ones who love this game, it just doesn't seem to be my style. ;)Story/Quests: Ähem. First a confession: I didn't finish it. Yeah. Sorry. It was just not interesting enough. There are epic bossfights, a very, very evil overlord, a war and you as - of course - the chosen one. At least everything you need for a high-fantasy RPG.NPC's are exchangeable all over the place, I cannot even remember a single name. Much less their background. The main Quests are okay, the ""guild""-Quests also, the rest is too often just filler (Kill X to get Y and bring it to Z), nothing memorable.World/Graphic:It's colorful. Very colorful. So colorful that I cannot take this game as serious as it wants to be. All this quirky, comic-like fairy-stuff... I mean, even the supposed ""Dark"" areas are kinda sweet! The Graphics themselves are okay, not state of the art, but it's a game from 2012, so - oh, wait... 2012? ... Yeah, they could have done it better then. But it's still not 'bad', just 'okay'. The map is gigantic and you are free to walk where you want. Unless you walk against a rock. Or against any other obstacle on your path. Even if it's just waist-high. And that upsets me every time in every game!But the music is lovely! Fighting/Level System:The Action is nice, there are a lot of cool moves you can do, some really powerful spells and techniques. All combined, it makes quite fun to slay all that monsters. And if you are as bored as me by the story (but still not bored enough to quit yet), you might also regard the looting and levelling as your last source of long-term motivation.Also the game has a cool crafting-system, it's diversive and sometimes useful at the same time!RPG really is my genre of choice, but it seems that I'm not a colorful, very-high-fantasy kind of player...I really gave it many chances to thrill me, but the atmosphere, the story, the character - all that failed to thrill me.

												Moderately ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game with far too easy of a combat system / gameplay, a storyline that tries to be rich and complex and detailed and just ends up being uninteresting while throwing far too much information at you, and graphics that feel like the entire thing is taking place in oldschool Ashenvale in World of Warcraft. Honestly. Areas all have a tint to them, and the first major one is pretty damn purple.I've never regretted paying full price for a game more (Save maybe Fable 3), but that's what I get for buying EA.

												Enjoyed this game alot on the XBOX 360 enough to rebuy it for PC. I should have just saved my money for something else because all Ive had since installing Kingdoms of Amalur is pure grief. First it begins with music stutter, then frames begin stuttering within 30 seconds of launching the game...then it crashes my PC. I guess this is another game that doesnt like the quad core i7. I cant recommned against buying the game for Duo core users as it will probably work better for them. After trying numerous times to get this game to run, I have given up and thankfully, I only lost $4.99 instead of $20. Its too bad though, I really would had liked to experience this game on PC instead of 360			",111,16,1,37,2,0,3

												I didn't like it. Basically, you can't jump and there are no objects in the game world, just containers; it's that sort of game. Don't get me wrong, the textures, lighting, character design, voices, buildings, weapons and world are OK, maybe 10 years ago I'd be really impressed with this game. However it just doesn't cut it after Skyrim, it's not even better then Oblivion or Gothic 2. To me, it's just not 'open world' unless you can jump and look around the back of the cave for a few elusive coins. Shame, because it looks like a nice world and it's obviously had a lot of thought put into it but the gameplay too generic, paint by numbers and boring.

												The combat is fun. Unfortunately: The world does not feel open enough for an open-world RPG, and the NPCs are not interesting enough for a story-directed RPG. I normally do all the side-quests in an RPG, and in this game there are just so many that they burnt me out. The overarching story is embarrassingly generic. About a third into the game, loot drops become useless; crafting, on the other hand, is overpowered. Feels too much like it was over-simplified for consoles. No support or updates to fix issues.

												First impressions were not positive.-World of Warcraft is a strong influence.  The narrative, visuals & voice acting are boilerplate.  If you've played WoW you already know how the story will be told and what it will look & sound like, right down to the elves & gnomes.-The combat system is derived from God of War, perhaps?  It works well for melee combat, but casting and archery are relegated to auto-targeting and feel dull.  -All player characters are male.-The menus are awkward; lots of decending and ascending through menu-after-sub-menu with little aesthetic flare.  -The much maligned quick-time event also makes an appearance.  I ignored it, but my character still produced a gigantic spear of pure light which he proceeded to plunge through his adversary' s face.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Every review is positive here, so im going to bring up the bad stuff about this game, and what other games does better.Where do I start?Your character is glued to the ground to start with. You cannot jump. The map is big, but because of the glued to the ground issue, and the way they built the enviroment, its tedious as **** to walk around in the world. Rocks, tree-roots, rivers and small valleys. Walk around and find the way down/over/around. Tedious. Also, the only way to ""jump"" down a valley or such, is to find a small wooden ramp. Then you press F and the character jumps down. The height of these will blow your mind. The world itself is big. Not HUUUUGE like the other wants you to think. Its not a free world like gta or skyrim, you go where they want you to go. Monsters/enemies. They are not very varied. Same stuff to kill over and over. (Fighting/combat is fun however so its 50/50)Reused textures/enviroments. Makes me angry, this♥♥♥♥♥♥right here. The caves that exists everywhere all look alike. Small differences but still big sections are the same everywhere. Kinda ruins the feeling.Leveling up is fine, so is the weapons dmg, types and so on.This game has nothing that skyrim doesn't do better. Looting and taking everything in the chest, you have to use the mouse to press ""take all"". And you loot a lot, A LOT. So small irratating things like these are everywhere.Fighting upphill? To bad, if you have ranged weapons/magic they will go straight forward, into the ground.  Story is ok. Good concept, poorly executed.PROS: Combat feels nice and looks good, WOW style. Big enemies, bosses and such are really fun to fight.CONS: The game is EASY. Im playin on hard right now and it feels like easy. This game has nothing on other games in the same genré.Conclusion: Save your money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												5/10The good:- Great combat system for an RPG- Great graphics and animation for its time; ran very light on my relatively weak systemThe bad:- A blind chimpanzee can beat this game's ""hard mode""- Without any challenge, there's no incentive to take advantage of the game's combat system- Very poor zone scaling mechanics hurt the ""open world"" aspectI should begin my review by saying that as far as RPG's go, I tend to be on the ""power player"" side of things which means that I'm more interested in combat mechanics than immersion and storyline.  KoAR is a game that had so much potential because the developers put so much effort into the combat system, yet all of it was thrown out the window because of the game's pathetically easy difficulty.The list of things that makes this game too easy is vast.  Your character gains exp too quickly.  Crafting and gathering grant you obscenely powerful items.  One single piece of equipment with HP regen renders you nearly invincinble for 99% of the game.  Some spells are incredibly overtuned.  The list goes on and on.  What makes this so frustrating is that ""Hard"" mode is actually quite challenging for the first hour or so.  In fact, approaching one of the first bosses at the wrong time can make for a very brutal fight.  But once your character begins to develop, any semblance of challenge is thrown out the window.  Side quests are a detriment to the player's enjoyment, because the character begins to gain too much exp and will eventually overlevel his surrounds by a wide margin.The combat system is one of the best seen in an open world RPG.  The game offers a lot of Devil May Cry-like mechanics which allow the player to dodge blows and juggle mooks, but why overcomplicate things when the monsters don't even hurt me to begin with?  I can try to juggle this kobold across the map with an insane looking combo, but in the end i could have closed my eyes and mashed left click to win the fight anyway.  It's just a mess of lost potential.  And this is on ""hard"" mode.The game has other flaws including a very poor level scaling system in which monsters in a zone are ""locked"" to the level which your character first entered the zone and some poor balance mechanics with the talent trees and side professions offered to the character.I understand people playing ""unarmed Dark Souls"" challenges or whatnot, but for this game it is a requirement to play with no side quests, no side professions, no potions, and use of only starting gear to even begin to feel like it had any difficulty.  I understand that Dark Souls and Devil May Cry aren't for anyone, but at least try to make ""hard"" mode... hard.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Lots of potential, and some of it is fun.  The biggest issue I have with this game is the same thing that ruined dragon age inquisition for me, way to much fluff.  There are things in the game designed to waste your time and make the game longer for the sake of it being longer and not designed to add to the game.			",23,7,0,13,5,1,0

												Fun, but too long.  You're not fixed into a specific character class like a lot of other RPGs, and you can build your character to fit your playstyle.  As the lucky one who's immune to fate, it is up to you to complete dozens and dozens of side quests because Bob is trapped by fate to be unable to get off his barstool to give a letter to Tim who's sitting at a table on the other side of the tavern.  I imagine if you didn't do all the sidequests, you might be able to remember why you are slaughtering your way across the land.  There is lots of gear to be found, but once you get a set, you find yourself keeping it for large parts of the game due to the set bonuses.  Occasionally with the combo system you end up just being dragged around by your sword.  Occasionally you will get NPCs to help you, but they are only to hold aggro as they do no damage and seem to be invulnerable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												le jeu s'affiche comme un mix entre God of War et Fable. Du coté gameplay il est plutôt bon et bien défoulant à condition de jouer un guerrier (sinon vous risquez de vous faire chier puisque l'IA des ennemis est égale à celle des gardes de AC).Le jeu avait tout pour plaire, la direction artitisque du titre est trés bonne est crée un décalage avec la beauté de l'environnement et la violence des combats qui n'est pas s'en rappelé Fable. Malheureusement, c'est la facilité du jeu, la pauvreté du scénario et de l'écriture pour un titre qui avait un univers pourtant riche qui m'a fais laché le jeu.En fait c'est un peu comme préparer une tarte au pomme alors que vous avez les ingrédients et le savoir pour faire bien plus que cela : c'est bon mais cela aurait pu être meilleur.

												Suprisingly good. The combat is fast paced but methodical enough to retain a classic RPG feel.It is a huge world to explore with hundreds of NPC's....but I could not get into the story and I did not care for alot of dialogue. As big as the world is - it actual an example of being to big due the fact you fight the same monsters and do the same tasks over and over again.  I put hours upon hours in the same damn area's and know there's diffrent scenery but lost intrest long before I saw it.It really unfortunet that the world is so unintresting as the gameplay / combat is FANTASTIC. The closest thing I can think is batman without the parry system. Really good stuff but a boring world.Recommended if on sale and looking for a good action RPG. Bumb the diffculty up as soon as it get's to easy. Extremly satisfying combat.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I like this game quite alot and played through the whole game along with one and a half of the DLCs. The big thing about this game is it's upgrade system as your 'class' is determined as you upgrade different things along the three skill trees, might, skill, and will. You can choose one tree to specalize in, two to favor, or go with all three.I did enjoy the combat but after a while it got pretty old. I eventually found my favorite combination of weapons, (greatsword and charams), and pretty much spent the rest of the game and DLCs doing the same moves over and over again. The game does have a system to let you respend all your skill points and try a different style but I never found a combination of weapons and skills that I liked more than the one I had already found.Also the enemies got really old too, flinging the same filler enemies at you again and again. If I get ambushed by imps ONE MORE TIME I am going to die!But now that I got my rage out of the way I do like and recommend this game. I could say the game is worth it's price but who am I kidding? Everything goes on sale eventually and this is somthing I would grab when it does.			",30,4,0,16,11,0,12

												Recommended with the caveat that you get it at a steep discount (50% or more). The biggest shortcoming is the camera; it's broken and a significant hindrance during combat. Since this is a pure hack and slash, it's mostly combat so once the enemies start using ranged attacks from ~30 meters away you'll have to swing the camera around manually to figure out what the hell is attacking you. It's just not worth $30. Not even $15, really, but if you've got it to spare and want something mindless with a _lot_ of crafting, this is where to go.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're looking for a generic RPG game in an open world with a decent skill and fight system Kingdoms of Amalur is worth a look. It isn't the best looking or the best balanced game out there but the story is decent and the fighting is fun. The game was developed originally as an MMORPG and you will see and feel fragments of it. Some quests have a heavy MMO feel to them, but the price and overall presentation make the game worthwhile. If the game is on sale and you're into RPG with a lot of action, you can't do much wrong with buying the game. I had fun with it and would buy it again.			",553,117,17,97,49,8,83

Posted: November 10, 2014
												I will write down this review as accurate and specific as possible, will quote spoilers where applicable.To give you context as to why I purchased this game, let me tell you that I came across its existence thanks to Mass Effect 3. I purchased the collector's edition and got the Reckoner Knight Armor, this brought me down to downloading the demo for Xbox 360 just about when Mass Effect 3 came out. I played the demo for 1.5 hours. I enjoyed it just as much as I enjoyed playing TES IV: Oblivion for the first time. But I had to play ME3, so I left the demo untouched forever, and said to myself; I will buy this game whenever I get the chance; whenever I have the money, and time to play it.To make the long story short, I just recently (about 5 months back) became a Steam player, and added the game to my wishlist. It wasn’t until about last week that I bought it. Now let me talk about the game itself.Oblivion; that was the experience I lived the first 6 hours of gameplay, a vast, open world to explore. There are rich characters, good graphics, gorgeous music, and killer combat and leveling systems. At first it took me some time to adapt to the enemy variety; particularly Boggarts, those slippery things are everywhere. Next was the weapon variety, just like in Oblivion; I found a 'Rusty Iron Longsword' and I won't lie to you, I felt like a god. Feeling that vanished the moment I ran across my first Troll. That fight took me a well invested 10 minutes to finish, I died 4 times before I could put the monster down (normal difficulty). Which brings me to the difficulty system; in normal, this game has its toll, it's not hard, but it certainly isn't easy.Like I said before, the graphics are average at best for a game that came in 2012, but overall, the world is beautiful. The design is just exquisite, it has a Fable-like yet LOTR-like feel to it. I have been playing for almost 20 hours, and I haven’t even paid attention to the main quest.I can go on, paragraph after paragraph, but I know that you don’t want to read all that. My final verdict for this game is a well-deserved 8/10. This game gave me the same experience Oblivion did when I first played it. It surely isn’t better than Skyrim in many aspects, but Bethesda wishes they had come up with a leveling and combat system as rich and powerful as Kingdoms of Amalur. The game has its appeal, and in terms of gameplay, it is a strong attempt. This franchise has a bright future, I hope someone with the resources and influence will someday give it a chance.

												this game is severely underrated. i felt like a jack of all trades beast when it came to combat. dialogue felt very stiff and life less and had me skipping tons of dialogue through boredom of the (mostly) deadpan voice overs. the powers/weapons/spells felt so perfect in combat that this game won me over right off the bat. the character customization is passable. the art style in the game overall impressed me and i enjoyed the fantasy setting. the game is honestly somewhat reminiscent of the Fable franchise, and if you are fine with those games then this is right up your alley.

												This is simply a GREAT game. It's a shame that Curt Schilling was ripped off and lost everything. This could have grown into a fantastic, long lasting franchise.Anyhow, the combat feels great - you can almost FEEL the strikes your character is making. The world is beautiful and there is lots to explore. The only weird thing is the jump mechanic. You can only jump from spots on the maop that allow jumping. So, sometimes movement is a bit strange, but, I bought this game soon after release and do not regret it. You can get it now for 6.00 USD??!! It's really a no-brainer!			",505,76,17,130,65,3,135

												le jeu s'affiche comme un mix entre God of War et Fable. Du coté gameplay il est plutôt bon et bien défoulant à condition de jouer un guerrier (sinon vous risquez de vous faire chier puisque l'IA des ennemis est égale à celle des gardes de AC).Le jeu avait tout pour plaire, la direction artitisque du titre est trés bonne est crée un décalage avec la beauté de l'environnement et la violence des combats qui n'est pas s'en rappelé Fable. Malheureusement, c'est la facilité du jeu, la pauvreté du scénario et de l'écriture pour un titre qui avait un univers pourtant riche qui m'a fais laché le jeu.En fait c'est un peu comme préparer une tarte au pomme alors que vous avez les ingrédients et le savoir pour faire bien plus que cela : c'est bon mais cela aurait pu être meilleur.

												Recommended with the caveat that you get it at a steep discount (50% or more). The biggest shortcoming is the camera; it's broken and a significant hindrance during combat. Since this is a pure hack and slash, it's mostly combat so once the enemies start using ranged attacks from ~30 meters away you'll have to swing the camera around manually to figure out what the hell is attacking you. It's just not worth $30. Not even $15, really, but if you've got it to spare and want something mindless with a _lot_ of crafting, this is where to go.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Its compelling lore and deep fantasy themes set this game in a heavily gripping setting. With action-oriented combat akin to God of War style and role-playing elements controlling your actions, you can feel as if you ARE the chosen one. The Fateless One.Although the game has aged, but it aged fairly well. The graphics are still awesome, the art style used really brings out the radiance in sceneries but the lack of good musical background still will not hold it back. There are instances where you are compelled to just stand still and take in the view while at other times, it seems you are really fighting for your life.Combat starts out really easy with the game trying to get you into the lores but as you play, even a full tanky Knight can easily be felled by countless assaults by enemies. A sneaky rogue can stealth kill a few enemies but you will have to stand and fight once the enemies start to notice you. A mage is very powerful in the game, even in melee combat, but there are more than a few enemies who are naturally resistant to magics. It proves challenging as the game goes on.Unfortunately, the studio's limited marketing and the fact that it was released at a very unfortunate time, only a few months after Skyrim, the game was overlooked by many and compared unfairly to Skryim. Skyrim's realism, freedom, modding capabilites, and long-lasting series were brought up against this game one too many times. Kingdoms of Amalur was not meant to be like Skyrim. It is a game that stands on its own and has a lot of it's own charms.All in all, the game stands out among all the other RPG I have played. I have over 1000 hours in Skyrim but only Kingdoms Of Amalur can fully immerse me in its fantasy lore and settings.I know because I modded Skyrim with naked chicks that weilds light sabers and a house that floats. I also have an immortal lamp sidekick. But only Amalur can make me play with its vanilla content and make me feel satisfied with it.			",51,6,0,14,5,0,2

												This game is great. there is a big well realised world with a lot of lore despite it being Tplkinesque. i spent a lot of time talking to all the characters to learn more about the world. There is a great sence of freedom and exploration. there are a lot of sidequests and you can spend many hours just playing those without doing the main quest. the combat is a great combination of meelee magic and bow and arrows. since there are a lot of differnt weapons that change up the combat whenever you switch them out. this can only work so well because the gameplay is fluid. combined with good sounds designe the combat feels impactfull despite not being overly graphic and bloody. this is also due to the artstyle of the game that is pritty easy on the eyes. the main story itself is a bit chliche despite the fact you ware raised from the dead and thus have no destiny unlike everyone els in the world. this concept is not used very interestingly and the story boils down to go beat the big bad guy. This is not a big problem since the great artstyle gameplay lootgrind and lore will keep you hoked buy this game.			",302,21,4,48,14,1,38

												I don't think I'll revisit this one. It reminds me of the monotony of World of Warcraft with less skills and single player, and without great atmosphere or attention to detail. The level design is open, spraling corridors, which makes it very ugly and unappealing to me. The mythos is interesting, but the writing seemed too much on the fanfic side. The side quests seem randomly generated, and I'm not sure that they aren't. There's some interesting combat mechanics with class switches depending on these card combinations... But the action itself isn't spectacular.When it comes down to it, Kingdoms of Amalur is boring, and mostly lifeless.  Seems like it would have been impressive enough in 2002, but doesn't offer any of the charm of games like Soul Reaver 2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												KoA:R is a game that I can play for hours and just get lost in the world.  I am an player of RPGs and I bought KoA:R on a whim when I wanted a new game to play.  The artwork was not a big seller for me.  Indeed, my initial reaction was that it was overly ""cartoony"" for my liking.  It grew on me and now I'm happy to see this world.You're allowed a fair bit of character customization (beyond the normal aesthetic options).  Skill point progression is, at first, odd since you can choose a destiny card to become a fighter, sorcerer, or finesse (thief) character - or a mixture of them.  You can ""respec"", for a price, via the Fateweaver NPCs throughout the world.  Any character race and skill combination will, at higher levels, be totally overpowered.  It's not really possible to completely hose your character, especially since you can tweak your character at the Fateweavers.  A fighter is a melee machine, a sorcerer can use elemental spells and ""magicky"" stuff to devastating effect, and finesse characters are backstabby/archers of doom.All characters can, via metagame knowledge, gain max skill points in every skill.  If you roleplay the character it might be more enjoyable than simply min/maxing, but either playstyle would work.Although the world is open and allows you to go just about anywhere, there is a bit of ""go this direction"" happening.  The world is broken down in to smaller map sections and each of these sections is sort of a self-contained adventure.  You quest in the zone and move to the next.  Nothing prevents you from running three zones over and, assuming you aren't killed outright, you can ""do stuff"".  There is a wierd level cap for each zone that sets the level to whatever your character's level is upon initial entry.  That zone is forever capped at that level.  This can break your adventure when you come back to the zone again.  It's not something I really noticed on my first playthrough.Like many games that offer choice, your choices are only a passing thought in the grand scheme of the world.  Some characters will recognize you for certain accomplishments or choices but overall the world remains largely unaware of your existance (apart from the NPCs involved in the the main questline).There is a great wiki and other online resources for the game if you like to game with the references open during the journey.Pros:* generally open world to explore, with a few quest locked areas (especially the second-half of the game)* nice character progression* easy to get into and play and not overly complicated* hard to ""gimp"" yourself* nice array of side quests to guide you on your journey* has a nice casual feel about things for relaxed play (if you enjoy that)Cons:* some may be put off by the graphics* the controls took a bit of getting comfortable with* the ability to easily reclass/respec your character may limit you on replay value* has a nice casual feel about things for relaxed play (if you're into hardcore)* choices in-game have only minor effect on the worldOverall rating:  8/10* Definately worth picking up on sale, or at any price if you're a fan of RPGs* I started playing and lost track of time			",27,17,0,23,15,1,8

												game runs like a knife cuts through butter, stable 200+ fps on a 780Ti, gameplay-wise one of the most enjoyable RPG's I have ever played. Really cool and versatile combat mechanics, every piece of gear looks friggin' awesome. Semi-linear open world with fun quests, great voice acting, and a lot of side quests to kill time with. All the basic RPG elements combined with a really addicting blacksmith system. KoA will always have a place in my heart.			",64,9,0,10,1,2,3

												I don't think I'll revisit this one. It reminds me of the monotony of World of Warcraft with less skills and single player, and without great atmosphere or attention to detail. The level design is open, spraling corridors, which makes it very ugly and unappealing to me. The mythos is interesting, but the writing seemed too much on the fanfic side. The side quests seem randomly generated, and I'm not sure that they aren't. There's some interesting combat mechanics with class switches depending on these card combinations... But the action itself isn't spectacular.When it comes down to it, Kingdoms of Amalur is boring, and mostly lifeless.  Seems like it would have been impressive enough in 2002, but doesn't offer any of the charm of games like Soul Reaver 2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a fun game to start, but could be much shorter.  So many of the quests are 'fetch 10 of this' or 'kill 10 of that'.  It gets boring quickly.  I feel as though they made a massive world, put the main story in, then realized it was still mostly empty.I outleveled every zone quickly before finishing most of the faction and side quests, forcing me to increase the difficulty just for a sense of fun.  You can respec at any time, so there is no reason to play through more than once.I haven't quite finished all the DLC, and I don't plan to do so.It's a decent game and the world had potential, but I think it missed the mark.  I'd recommend something else for your fantasy-rpg fix.			",78,21,0,18,9,0,12

												I want to start off by saying yes, this is a genuinely good game. 8.5/10 in my book. Nobody's getting paid to write all these positive reviews.Pros: -Excellent combat: It takes a bit of getting used to; because the game LOOKS so much like an MMO, you expect to just be able to hold down M1 and swish around. This is not the case. Combat takes a bit more skill than that, and honestly reminds me a bit of Dark Souls, just cleaned up around the edges a bit. You get several ""encounter powers"" that use mana, and these come with every class. The ability to slip into ""Fate mode"" is an awesome addition, basically everything slows down and the last thing you kill is smote in an epic slow-mo QTE.-Great art style: The graphics kind of remind me of Torchlight, but if you could zoom waaay in on Torchlight and see all the little details. It's overall smooth, and, once again, reminiscent of your typical MMO. Overall the landscape is bright and colorful, and there's never a lack of things to look at even in the darkest, gloomiest caverns. -Good animations: Overall the game flows. I suppose this ties mostly into combat, but I hardly ever see things chopping around. It's not exactly the best in show for animation, but only the occasional buggy-eyed townie and jump to another stance while in combat break the immersion, and the physics hardly ever seem out of place.Cons:Crafting: My biggest bone to pick with this game is the crafting system. I personally have had a difficult time figuring it out, and it really doesn't seem worth it. There are Smithing, Alchemy, and ""Sagecraft,"" each representing weapon/armor crafting, potion crafting, and enchantment crafting respectively. Sagecraft is a bit like Torchlight's enchantment system, where you can upgrade gem shards into enchantments for your weapons. My problem is, I can seldom find weapons that are better than my starter (from a DLC I'm assuming) hammer, The Mountain, which lacks an enchantment slot. So I'm brought to wonder what the point of that even is. I haven't focused on Alchemy at all seeing as I can just buy potions, and am brought back to my Sagecraft problem when it comes to Smithing. Nothing I can fabricate is better than The Mountain thus far. Furthermore, the crafting skills all level with you, assuming you've put your one skill point per level into a crafting skill. There's no way to level them up besides this, which is probably just as good considering they seem to be fairly useless entities.Music and Sounds: The music is fitting in most circumstances, but the sounds could have been done a lot better. In particular the grunts/squeals of the various characters and fauna; the action noises and other sound effects are just fine. Right off the bat though, you're met with strange grunting noises that seem out of place and repetative as your character decends from a pile of dead bodies. You can replicate this awkward, way-too-long performance at any time by repeatedly smashing the sprint button; if this is done right, the player character will take on the posture and personality of a large ape as he lopes towards his next objective, making strange gutteral noises while he does so. I also found the animals to have similarly small sound banks that tend to repeat themselves a tad too often.Overall the pros certainly outweigh the cons, and for such a low sale price you'll get many hours of quality gameplay.

												I really really tried forcing myselfe to continue playing but i simply couldn't. Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning™ starts off as a great concept and at first it seems like a really fun hack and slash with a lot of customisation and strong RPG-Elements.But it isn't. You'll find yourselfe spamming the same 3 combos all the time while getting annoyed of hundrets of MMORGP-like Sidequests.I heared you people love +/- Lists so here you go!The Good+ Character customisation. You really have a lot of options and skills to chose from. You can also customise the apperance of your charater but the options are very limited so don't expect it to be as complex as in TES-Games.+ Voice Acting. Honestly i haven't seen the entire game but so far i think all NPCs where well voiced. With one huge exception. Your own character. All your character has are texts you can choose in Dialoges and the ""uh"" ""uah"" ""ah"" in combat. This actally doesn't bother me too much as it's already a common thing in a lot of RPGs.+ Open World. There is actally a lot of loot and other stuff to look for. Would be a huge + if the game was genarally good.+ Decisions. Yay! I cannot tell you how much effect they have on the world around you but at least you can make some.The Meh~ Enemies. Not much variety for such a huge world but many of them require unique strategies to deal with them without losing too much life. For many of them it's recommended to learn their attacks and how to counter them.The Bad- Generic MMORPG feeling. The Quests are getting boring after the first few hours and even if there is a huge effort to make the Quests interesing, it still felt like brainless EXP-grinding.- Tons of Sidequests. Wait, how is that a bad thing? Well if the game isn't fun at all you don't want to waste hours over hours doing minor stuff so you can keep up with the level of your enemies.- Combat. If the combat gets dull and boring in a game build around combat nothing else can safe the game from a bad score. The combat it repetitive and boring. At first it seems fresh and fun but after a few hours in you'll see how boring it gets when you spam the same stuff over and over again with the wepons(s) of your choice.- Bugs. Tbh i haven't encountered any but i haven't made it far enough into the game to get to the buggy parts of it. Quests cannot be completed if you do stuff in the wrong order and things like that. So a lot of save slots are highly recommended.- EA Account. Yes, it's one of those games where you have to make a third party account and have to be online to play a singleplayer game.- Inventory. A barely sorted List of Stuff, that you can only extend buying a limited Number of Backpacks from some NPCs. This is the Part where you clearly see that this game is a console port.3.5/10 Because EA didn't pay me			",255,51,1,51,28,3,31

												I honestly can't recommend Kingdoms of Amalur unless you buy it on sale. It isn't a bad game, but it certainly isn't good, either.Some of the major problems I have with it include a terrible camera, generic story and setting, boring and uninspired RPG elements, bloated busywork sidequests, and a combat system that would be fun if not for groups of enemies that stunlock the crap out of you. That said, I DO think it is a decent timesink if you are looking for one. I just think that your money is going to be better spent elsewhere.			",194,44,0,53,18,0,40

												Kingdoms of Amalur is at odds with itself.  On the one hand, it strives to be an epic fantasy along the lines of Skyrim or Oblivion (or even WoW).  On the other, it is an arcade action game.  The arcade part is fun.  The rest... not so much.  The backstory and the lore are dull, as are most of the voice actors.  Quests are generally interesting... many are simple fetch quests or kill monster X at location Y.  But many are multi-part with intriguing backstory.The story has something to do with your character be exempt from fate because you were resurrected from the dead.  And other characters want to help or exploit you.  Or something like that.  But, as a whole, it just doesn't come together.  There's nothing compelling about the story.  The mini-games pale in comparison to their Bethesda counterparts.  I clicked through every dialog tree as quickly as possible.  There are stones scattered in the world which, when touched, divulge some of the lore via a voice-over.  I couldn't pay attention to a single one of them.  Now, on the combat side, it resembles more of a Darksiders flair.  You roll around to avoid enemy attacks and wait for the right moment to close and shred your opponent.  Some monsters just absorb hits until they die.  Others will take a few before striking back.  The only downside is that it becomes repetitive.  Each dungeon has the same types of monsters, reasonbly spread across the map.  But after my 5th encounter with kobolds, for instance, I was ready to move on.Kingdoms of Amalur sports an RPG element.  Your character levels up and points can be allocated into different skill trees.  Some of them unlock cool moves that can be used in combat.  Others unlock world exploration skills like alchemy (dull), lockpicking (dull), finding hidden stashes (dull),  and the like.  And, you can re-roll your character at any time -- a feature that I haven't used yet, but appreciate that it is there.The game is definitely on the easy side, especially if you avail yourself of the powerful weapons available at the start of the game.  Set the game on hard and pick less damaging weapons (like daggers) to make the game more exciting.  Nevertheless, with six hours into the game, I'm probably done with it.  It hasn't grabbed me.  And, as a gamer with limited time for gaming, I have to be engaged from the first moment.  The story needs to be compelling.  The characters (especially my character) need to be intriguing; their dialog something I listen to with rapt interest.  And if not that, then the action needs to be exciting.  Perhaps if it mixed the combat with some Prince of Persia like platforming elements, and downplayed the story/RPG stuff?It feels too much like a couple of different incomplete games all squished together into a mostly ineffective whole.  It's not enough to keep my interest.			",155,37,0,11,4,1,0

The game is fine, it has refreshing story scent to it. Everything you do feels like a fantasy novel. However, it does not have the open worldness that it advertises, compared to skyrim which you can do much, reckoning's degree of freedom is very limited.			",4,0,0,2,1,0,1

												I played this game back then and decided to finish it this time around because of the Steam Sales. It's a decent game but it has a lot of flaws. If you can stomach those flaws then you'll probably like the game. -Story and Charcters are your every cliche in a fantasy setting. Overall the story isn't interesting and the characters aren't compelling. It's hard to even care much for most of the NPCs.-They use the same voice actors multiple times and it starts to get weird that every other character or NPC sounds about the same.-Invisible walls! Tiny pieces of cobblestone or rocks can become impassable although you should by all rights be able to walk over it. You're basically a demigod near the end and you still can't jump over certain terrain that visually you should be able to.-The game has a lot of tedious fetch quest and it hurts since your character runs so slowly.-The travel time between quests. Fast travel helps but you most of the quests are in between locations and you have to run slowly looking for items or NPCs.-Very stiff contorls. It basically means that combos can often become awkward and that you can't cancel an attack once you click on the button. It just feels so STATIC although the attack animations and combos plus different weapon tactics are somewhat entertaining the first time around. -Crafting in the game is a chore and more of an afterthought. You'll have no reason to use it once your character is upgraded enough and you can find better items through loot drops or chests.When it was released it had nothing new to offer the genre and it didn't age gracefully either.

												There was a lot of hype in my circle of friends and colleagues when this game first launched years ago. They praised the combat system and the ability to forge your own character class as you go along. They lived in the world of Amalur and it's bright, colourful forests filled with magical creatures and countless NPCs needing your help. They urged me to give the game a go so I can experience it's wonder for myself......and years later I decided to do so. In fact, I gave the game 3 chances to grab me. The first time I finished the tutorial section and stepped bright eyed into the sunlight, I was immediately overwhelmed by the sheer amount of dialogue to work through when approaching characters. Life was busy back then and I had other games vying for attention, so I gave up and shelved the game. A year later I decided to pick it up again and continue from where I left off. I skipped through the dialogue to get to the ""fun"" parts of the game, but it felt a little empty without the context of why I'm breaking crates or hunting down rogue leaders. I promptly shelved it again.So, I attempted it again 6 months later and decided I'll persist. Sadly, it was in vain. I progressed quite far into the game this time around and managed to finish roughly 60 main-, side- and faction quests. The game never managed to immers me in it's world and I really became irritated with the sheer volume of flat dialogue the game insists on throwing at you. The choices I made felt inconsequential, the boss fights were just dances of dodge-hit-dodge and spamming whatever special abilities I managed to unlock at that point. Crafting felt useless as the items I managed to loot from the game world was sufficient (bordering on over-powered) and I never felt any need to spend the copious amounts of gold I managed to hoard.I really want to recommend this game, but it felt like an absolute chore to play and I didn't enjoy a single minute of it.

												This game was not future proofed at all it seems. It struggles on windows 10 and for some strange reason having an Xbox One controller plugged into your PC will make the audio scratchy or cut out entirely. Xbox360 controllers work fine and the game is fun... but unless you have an old 360 controller and an older version of windows DO NOT BUY IT. IT WON'T WORK. I would love to recommend the game, but with how fast people are upgrading these days, chances are it won't be able to be played from your game library sooner rather than later.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

However, the game is simply littered with horrendous design choices that make it fall short. Its name should be Extreme Walking Simulator. 1% of the game is talking to people, fighting etc while the other 99% is bloody walking; and the map is gigantic!

Basically you're some chosen one, who can change fate. Environments are kind of dull a lot of flat plains, and corridor dungeons. There's really no exploration. Combat isn't very fluid, although I only played a sorceror. Lore is boring, they have books, but they never captutred my attention. The dialogue is boring. You get choices, in to what you're saying, but in the end they're all the same. Even with pursuasion, it doesn't even have any real benefits. i gets repetitive and boring.			",174,15,0,31,5,1,21

												My first impressions of this game were that it would be an immersive and exciting gameplay expierence. I can understand why people like this game but I can't stand it. It's a graphically down graded hack-n-slash rip off of games like Fable. But if I had to pick one thing about this game it would be the graphics. Now I know you should not ever complain about graphics in a game but this is an exception. During the trailer and all of screenshots they look nothing like the game on the Highest detail which leads me to belive they pulled a Watch_Dogs and used a graphics option that isn't made available to the consumer. Overall I'd give this game a 6/10, many things that are unique but had they not followed every single cliche in games liek this, being the ""Chosen one"", having God Like powers etc. etc. I would have really loved the game. Either way, waste of money.			",107,7,0,8,12,0,2

												(This review is solely based on my own preferences. The game overall has a good rating, and many people do enjoy the game. If this game looks like your kind of thing, I say go for it, but the game did not do anything for me)It's been 6 years since the game released, and I never really felt like I'd enjoy this game just by looking at it, but one day I gave it a try. I didn't get far at all. The combat was pretty good, but I didn't enjoy the dialogue, or the characters I met. I recently tried it again and got further than my original playthrough, but I ran across the same things that basically deterred me from enjoying the game anyway.The character customization is so horridly minimal that it may as well not even be there, and I'm not a fan of the style of graphics for the most part. The world of Amalur is very pretty, but it's almost cartoon-y, which I'm sure a large majority of players are fine with, it just wasn't my cup of tea. I wasn't a big fan of the weapon/armor designs, and honestly, the game cover entails a much different feel than the graphics show.The game has an absurd amount of invisible walls that, for a game made in 2012, shouldn't have even been a thing. I could be on a a miniscule-sized ""Cliff"", for a lack of a better word, that could be literally 2 feet higher than the ground next to it, and I can't just hop off of those 2 feet of elevation, instead I have to run all the way around like a fixed pathway. This wouldn't be an issue except it's the case for pretty much everywhere. Again, for a 2012 game, this shouldn't have been a thing.I was so early in the game and it just felt like a chore to play through. Plain and simply - this game was not meant for me.

												Kingdoms of Amalur is a game that I sadly do not recommend. It lacks depth and immersion to justify playing this game for an extended peroid of time. The storyline is dull, the npcs are forgettable, and the world is just outright boring. While the concept behind the lore is rather unique, there's nothing to draw you in, to make you invested in the story or even your own character! To help visualize, Kingdoms of Amalur is a MMORPG without the multiplayer. The only redeeming quality is its combat. Combat in this game is among one of the most entertaining that I have ever played in any RPG, and has that ""easy to learn, difficult to master"" aspect to it. However, after minutes of gloriously decimating your enemies, you would likely become bored, and exit the game.

												A perfect example of a game that looked so good on paper but was executed so badly it was exiled to a corner and no one wants to mention it today. All in all KoA: Reckoning is a solid RPG, it has a huge world with tons of NPC's and quests, it has rich lore behind the world that, most of the time, makes sense, and the game introduces things like the lorestones and Reckoning Mode to spice things up both on the RP side and the Action side.Unfortunately pretty much every aspect of this game falls flat. The talent system is pretty redundant and mostly serve to give you passive bonuses you can fit your playstyle around (!), as any true RPG blacksmithing and enchanting is as overpowered as a Predator and the dialog is sometimes so bad that you wish you bought the game on a CD-disc just so you could throw it out the window.All in all, if you're looking for the next Icewind Dale, Masquerade: Bloodlines or Dark Souls, this is not it. But if you wish for a Bulletstorm with magic instead of guns then this game will cuddle and snuggle you warm forever. Or at least the 50hours it takes to explore the world.			",201,29,4,33,11,1,29

												Some basic tips for the Standard difficulty.1) Do all the available side quests before advancing the main quests.2) Do not mix Finesse and Magic trees unless you can find daggers equal to your level. They aren't nearly as common as they should be. Otherwise, you can't handle enough damage and don't kill things quickly enough.3) Dodging is not as useful as the game claims for two reasons.3a) Dodge doesn't give you any tactical positioning. In fact, most of the time you end up with your back to an opponent that's already turned to face you, so you end up repeat dodging just to get clear without getting it while they follow you.3b) Certain bosses are too fast for dodging to be useful. Or they have AoE's that are too large to escape with a dodge. There's also fighting multiple opponents at once. They flank and they knock you off balance long enough to hit you again.4) Amp your resistances up like your life depends on it. It does.5) Load up on potions. Your life depends on these too.If you leave any of these tips out, be prepared for frustration and loud cursing.Oh, and don't count on the NPC's that sometimes accompany you to be useful. They're not. They can't deal damage worth sneezing at, and some of them spend more time rolling around than stabbing things.Last Tip: The boss at the Hyperian is multi-stage. Be careful about using Fate Mode on him too early. This is the one that got me so frustrated I uninstalled the game.Enjoy!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I will write some advantages and disadvantages for this game.The advantages:First, The game has a very long story line, I ended the game for over 100 hours.Second, The game graphic is good, make eyes very comfortable.Third, Easy level up and productive skill up,No level pressure in this game.Fourth, Beautiful magic spells, unprecedented feelings of RPG games.The disadvantages:First, Blacksmithing skills is too strong, you can easily make to break the balance of the equipments.Second, the side storyline was too long and no sense, you will waste lots of time for sidequest and reward is too bad, only a few useless golds.Third, The monster type is too little, when I level 1, I killed some wolves, now I am level 40, I still found a bunch of wolves in the wild.That was a good game but not perfect like Skyrim,and there has a sad news...the game company was closed, R.I.P Kingdoms of Amalur.

												I've played too much WoW for this to be enjoyable.  The combat is good-ish, but is hampered by the fact that the game even on hard mode isn't actually hard (infact I'd say that hard is very easy, especially if you try to finish all the quests in each zone and get overgeared).  I would not recommend this game because this game lacks the polish that I'd expect from a single player RPG, and lacks the multiplayer advantages from an MMORPG.  I completed the first four zones or so and found the game to be just too easy/monotonous to be enjoyable, and thus will not be finishing the entire thing.  But if there's one thing I can say is that this game has A LOT of content (apparently anyway, I'm not sticking around to find out.), so if you can buy it cheap go for it.			",10,6,0,13,0,0,5

												While having some great concepts and mechanics, overall this game feel like playing a mediocre MMO solo all the time. The quests are all follow the dot and then run all the way back to turn it in, combat is pretty simplistic and I hvae found no real reason to actually pay attention to the dialogue or the extra information that you have no need for. The controls are also sluggish at times, where you will press keys multiple times and nothing wil happen. Your Power Up ability (X) also does this where you will be pressingit constantly but the mode is never entered. So all in all, it is a decent MMO style single player RPG that offers little new to refresh the tired and overused components.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gameplay:A failed middle ground between Dragon Age and Elder Scrolls. While allowing the player flexibility in choosing skills from three categories (essentially allowing a choice of 7 classes from a mix of warrior/mage/rogue), the limited active skills from which the player can choose from negates any advantage this flexibility would have offered.There is equipment/item crafting in the game but the inventory management is attrocius making the crafting a chore.

Conversation choices have no meaning on the outcome of the game other than the occaisional benefit of avoiding another repetitive fight. This could have been all right if there was a good story but...**SPOILER**... the story is really boring: Player is revived, removing them from the control of ""fate,"" and takes a straight line to killing an elf with aims of world conquest who happens to be under the control of an evil dragon that was responsible for originially killing the player.

												Finally decided to uninstall this - tried to play this on-and-off but it doesn't hold my interest, the game is like a fancy sword that lives in a scabbard which blunts itself when it's drawn.+ Big game, lots of side quests, lots of dialogue- Boring quests, boring characters, boring mobs, over level for main quest+ Lots of loot, crafting with alchemy and smithing- Too little inventory space, over powered weapons make the game too easy+ Lots of different locations- Very same-ish dungeons, with boring travel to each new location (sparse mobs placement)Dodge mechanic would have made this extremely easy game already too easy - except hit boxes and attack timings seem all wrong. You can roll out of the way but still get hit. But your gear will by mitigating so much damage that you can just tank everything even as a caster. One hit bosses totally possible because the side-quest will over level you. The game is 70% travelling, 20% mowing down boring enemies and 10% skipping mundane dialogue. If you want lots of mediocre content for cheap, this game is great on sale. Can't recommend though.			",125,24,0,25,18,1,23

												Well, i have played this game enough to make a review.Lets see, the combat system is really fast, fun and it can get very challenging some times.The main plot is really interesting and well made.If you like Skyrim, this game is twice as better IMO. Better lore and combat.Play the game on HARD, becouse even on hard after you gear up a little, you will be able to 2-3 shot mobs.Lets talk a little about skills:First try to max your skill points in BLACKSMITH and SAGECRAFT. You will be able to build the best possible gear for your class. And believe me, craft gear is insanely good. My crafted Greatsword has +67% Damage and all my gear adds another +300% DMG , +50% Damage Resistance, +90% Physical Resistance and 30% Elemental Resistance, pretty much GOD MODE. And the craft system is really simple and fun to mess with. It gives you a better understanding of the game.Lockpicking is CRAP becouse you can afford thousands of lockpicks, and they are very easy to pick.Persuasion is good at some points of the game, but after you finish main/faction quests it becomes useless, so i dont recommend coz you can solve the quest by other means anyway.Dettect Hidden is awesome, will help you a lot at all stages of the game. Try to max after blacksmith and sagecraft.Stealth is crap IMO, why sneak behind an enemy, if you can simply walk up to him and ♥♥♥♥♥ slap him over 9000.Don't Buy any DLC before lv 35.Stick with main and faction quest ONLY. Sides quests are just fillers and most of the time annoying to do.There is so much to talk about this game, that i dont even remember right now.This game is worth buying, no doubt. =)			",48,4,1,6,7,0,4

												Not a bad game for a genre clone - this wannabe fable wannabe skyrim features gnomes instead of dwarves and Fae instead of elves, but other than that mostly conforms to the tolkien rules. The ""young races,"" humans (which are subdivided into skyrim-like factions), are in danger of extinction because of the ""crystal war,"" where the Fae ""Tuatha"" have declared war because ♥♥♥♥ it, ♥♥♥♥ humans, I guess. The player is in the ever-imaginative position of an amnesiac who somehow has mastery of all weapon types, who wakes up as the Tuatha raid a gnommish outpost and from there I pretty much just stopped paying attention. The story is not very exciting. The ""Destiny"" system, where the player can build themselves between the three fantasy rpg classtypes (if you dont know what those are, this game would not be a great place to enter the fantasy genre), is a great idea, especially if you're a completionist and you want to see what total hybridization has to offer. The way the trees build is a little stupid though - there are like 9 types of weapons and you can put points into one weapon type at a time - if you go for full hybrid, like I did, you pretty much just suck with everything, which is what I expected. The level cap is ♥♥♥♥ing 40, which is GARBAGE - there are about 120 point slots for each classtype, so you can basically unlock a total THIRD of the potential of your game (I used a save editor to give myself more points because it was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥). Gold is too readily available and doesn't restrict purchases at all, and the gear tries to be like diablo but it just....isn't. The looting is a little stupid. I'd give this game about a C, it captures attention at first but its flaws just rear up and are impossible to ignore. I loved tossing around chakrams and screw-attacking through people with my warrior-rogue-mage hybrid, but I got so bored I just left-clicked my way through the last third of the game.

												Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is one of the most disappointing games I've played recently; not because it's bad, but because it was almost great.It seems to me after playing it that it may have been designed to be an MMO, but was converted late in development to a basic single-player-only Action RPG, one that's very light in design depth.  The action side of things is a very standard hack-and-slash set-up that would be familiar to players of anything from Zelda to God of War.  However, it's marred by bad mechanics, such as mobs that rotate to follow your dodge roll and the combination of long ability cooldowns and instantaneous potion use.  Rather than fight the giant bosses by blocking and dodging and using powerful spells, it's much more effective to mash attack while tapping the health potion button.The RPG side fares worse, with talents and skills that are usually completely worthless, but punctuated with a few over the top broken abilities (such as Elemental Rage).  There's also the likes of Dispel and Lockpick, which are worthless as dispelling rarely works right and lockpicking rarely fails, regardless of how many points you have.  Participation in the story is just not there, apart from the tiny handful of ""Rescue Orphans or Eat Kittens"" choices.  (The overwhelming appearance of the yea-or-nay choice in dialogue is usually a 'But Thou Must' situation.)On the other hand, the world, story, writing, and presentation are top-notch. (Well, apart from the ""We call Elves 'Aoeuolhffwvyr'"" problem and the ripping-off-Warhammer graphics that were already old when Warcraft 3 came out.)  Which brings me to the frustrating decision here.  Is it worth putting up with generic, boring, poorly-designed gameplay for a fun, well-realized, and utterly huge RPG world?  For my part, I say skip it.  You may enjoy it, but only if you can put up with the problems above.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												well, this game , this game . Its a game changer when comming to RPGs and the ""Open World"" experience , some people even say its better than skyrim . The games combat system is Amazing , far better than any rpg i have ever played (and i play alot of RPGs) . the graphics are stunning , its got the cartoony graphics of WoW and the realism of CS:GO. Exceeds all of my expectations for a game in the A-RPG genre. Gameplay is stellar and unparalleled by any of its competitors. If you're looking for a great game that will be one of the funnest you've played, then this is the one for you.I was also surprised at how well they integrated the fantastic combat into a lore-laden world. The immersion is instant and perpetual which as an RPG junkie, is a must!-DayRider			",131,10,1,10,6,0,4

												I'd give this game a 6 out of 10, don't pick it up unless you can get it at a deep discount. A poor man's Skyrim, where the terrain is full of invisible walls. I thought having RA Salvator's name attached to it would guarrantee a dessent story line. I was proven wrong, game plays like an MMO or old school RPG. None of the quests seem to have any baring on the story line, and even though you become head of the society of mages or a king, you are still treated as a serf. Gameplay is enjoyable, I played as a mage and once you had meteor the combat became monotonous.			",168,21,3,26,17,0,34

http://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/991142-kingdoms-of-amalur-reckoning/reviews/review-153084I wrote a long review on the game a while back. But my short version is that it was one of teh most underrated games of 2012. A lot of people overlooked it an dismissed it as ""generic"" or ""boring"" but compared to all the other fantasy action RPGs, this one was actually a blast to play. Top notch combat, lots of side quests, 3 totally different character classes with support for hybrid classes with my favorite being the Jack Of All Trades, Legend Of Dead Kel was one of the best DLC expansions I've played period, and it's a very large expansive world. What is there to hate?			",195,74,4,23,7,3,21

												Kingdom of Amalur:Reckoning is a game that isn't special in any way, shape or form. At first it was designed to be an MMORPG, which shows in its world design. Sadly this design is completely uninspired, having different areas connecting awkwardly with a linear dungeon every here and then.Due to trying to be an MMORPG at first it is filled with a WoW-esque cartoony artstyle, minus the talent that was present in let's say WoW vanilla, TBC and WotLK.Even at its highest difficulty, ""hard"", this is a game with zero difficulty. Primarily caused by the fact that you attack very fast, hit hard and have a great reach with most weapons. Secondarily caused by a gimmick that many games have, you, as the main character, receive some nonsense overpowered abilities that no enemy in the game can actually do anything against.  So even if you somehow find an enemy that you can't stunlock in this game, you can just activate your power which slows down time and makes you hit harder to stunlock it anyways.But by all means, if you're interested in a game with a forgettable art style, boring story, combat so easy that you can hardly call it a game, poor voice acting, poor dungeon and world design, then this is the game for you.

												At first I judged this game quite harshly because I heard it was like Skyrim, I found out it wasn't what I was expecting and haven't played it for quite some time. Now I'm playing through it and I absolutely love it.I recommend this game if you like action RPGs with fairly open worlds. It's FAR better than Two Worlds/2. It feels like a cross between the action of God of War with the good RPG elements of Fable without the bad. It's a very unique title.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I put WAY too much time into this game.  Completing the main plot, and almost every quest midway though the world.  There is certainly a lot to this game, and it seems to check all the boxes for a good RPG.  However it's repetitive combat, forgettable gear, and MEH story will stop being fun long before the game is even close to ending.  I only beat it so that it didn't beat me.  If you must play this game, don't bother getting sidetracked, just hack away and hope you get to the end before what fun can be had wears thin.			",70,27,0,16,1,0,10

												This is a pretty long game with good voice acting and story for the main quest line, but outside of the quest cutscenes most of that time is spent doing unfun things.  Travelling, fighting, looting and mini games all are just not done well compared to many other games.The fighting is way too easy to be any sort of fun and when your character is hit you stagger which interrupts any sort of flow.  If an enemy does manage to hurt you, instant use health potions make it impossible to ever die in this game.  Enemies popping out of the ground constantly is annoying and you may quickly find you get sick of it all and just run past as much as you possibly can.  If you ever get into a tough fight, you have an *I win* slow-mo mode that also gives you bonus XP for using.The looting is crazy, with chests littered all over the place.  You'll quickly fill your backpack with loads of vendor trash to accumulate useless gold with.  On top of that your armor takes damage for no apparant reason so you will have to go back to town to get repairs.Inventory management is a pain with the massive piles of loot you get, which isn't helped by the fact that there are a billion different slight variations of potions you'll never use because the fights are so easy.  Also many quest items are bugged and will permanently suck up your inventory space, yuck.The minigames are just dumb time wasters.  There are two to unlock chests, the lockpicking mostly is just holding a key down and waiting as the default position will unlock a chest most of the time.  The dispelling of a chest is slightly more interesting but quickly becomes tiresome on the far far too common chests.Outside of the main quest line and faction quests, which are good, there isn't a lot of variety with most being go to spot X on the map and kill a bunch of things and come back.  The pirate DLC quest series is a standout and if you do decide to get this game (don't) and make it to Rathir then pick up the ""Legend"" DLC as it is as good if not better than the main game.This could have been a pretty awesome game with some tweaking but the good bits are buried under way too much tiresome muck you need to shovel through.

												I want to like this but the camera is just plain awful. When you aren't in combat it's too close to the character so that you can't see a thing going on around you, and when you are in combat it tries to zoom out to give you a good perspective but often your character will just go off the screen. Often in the game I was just spamming buttons because I couldn't even see myself or the enemies. It's terrible at following the character and hard to put up with for a game that has hundreds of hours it expects me to sit through.			",231,47,0,23,19,2,8

												Bought this game after getting an itch for a new RPG.  A lot of the game reminded me of Dark Souls, since the combat was pretty unforgiving and required precise timing.  You cannot hack and slash your way through the game, which I liked. However, if a game is going to be unforgiving, I am going to be the same way towards its polish.  KoA has some pretty bad camera work that make timing the perfect dodge or counter attack near impossible once an enemy dashes behind you.  The direction your character attacks is also subject to this issue.  Spent far longer than I should have on some fights purely because the camera disagreed with me all too regularly.The quests have the depth of your average MMO (go kill X enemy type, fetch Y item for me).  I simply ran out of reasons to push forward through the game and was too frustrated by its problems.The game also doesn't come with any options menu of any depth, if that's important to you.  It feels very much like a mediocre (but not terrible) console port.Unless you have a strong desire for a tough RPG, I would stay away.  If you happen to really love those types of games, you may be able to push through the issues.			",208,12,0,27,14,1,14

												I tried to get into it, I really did, but it just feels... wrong. I've heard before that Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning was a failed attempt at an MMO and I'm afraid it shows. Between monsters constantly spawning up and quests being largely inconsequential I can't help but feel I'm playing a single player MMO. The combat is obviously what is going to bring in most people and it is entertaining but it gets really old really quick. As if that isn't bad enough the level up system follows that bad system that keeps getting thrown around where you only buff up a few things by a couple percents for every point *cough*Borderlands*cough*. I don't give a damn if I now have 3% to crit as opposed to 2.5%, I want to feel like that 1 point can completely change my character. Instead of busting out an abacus to figure out which percent is better to raise I should be able to tilt my head back and ask myself ""How do I wanna ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥up today?"".tl;dr it's a failed attempt at an rpg, give it a pass unless it's on a huge sale and the combat really grabs you			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had been looking forward to playing Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning for quite some time. The action-RPG style was very appealing as most combat in this genre is point-and-click clunkiness. To my initially great pleasure, the combat was just as I expected, similar to Darksiders but as I played further, I found it to be very boring and repetitive. The same attack sequences, the same types of enemies, the same thing... over and over. So while the combat was good to start, it failed to hold my interest in the long run... even after unlocking the full tree.The stories (main and side) of KoA are extremely bland. Only towards the very end did the main story line get somewhat interesting then it felt completely rushed and overlooked in the interest of ending the story. If you play RPGs for a deep story, you will not find it here.I was very disappointed to find a level cap of 40. If you most of the side quests, you will hit this well before the end-game. Sure you can respec any try a different playstyle or character build but in the end, you will still be maxed at 40 which truly only allows for one specialization.The amazing choice/consequence of alternative games was non-existent in KoA. You have dialogue options but none that really affect the story or outcome... so while the game says you decide your fate, this is hardly the case.Graphically, the game looked decent. Some of the textures (especially grass) looked awful but it ran very smoothly. Music was good and very fitting.The crafting aspect allows you to create any kind of weapon/amor you want. This is a pretty nice feature as it does allow you to customize gear according to your playstyle.On the plus side, the DLC (Teeth of Naros and Dead Kel) were both excellent. They are fully developed and not quick to complete. Both were definitely worth the extra money.Overall, I was disappointed with KoA. The repetitive nature and linear choice/story made for a bland experience. My rating is 6.5/10.			",149,35,1,22,7,1,24

Travelling, fighting, looting and mini games all are just not done well compared to many other games.The fighting is way too easy to be any sort of fun and when your character is hit you stagger which interrupts any sort of flow.  If an enemy does manage to hurt you, instant use health potions make it impossible to ever die in this game.  Enemies popping out of the ground constantly is annoying and you may quickly find you get sick of it all and just run past as much as you possibly can.  If you ever get into a tough fight, you have an *I win* slow-mo mode that also gives you bonus XP for using.The looting is crazy, with chests littered all over the place.  You'll quickly fill your backpack with loads of vendor trash to accumulate useless gold with.  On top of that your armor takes damage for no apparant reason so you will have to go back to town to get repairs.Inventory management is a pain with the massive piles of loot you get, which isn't helped by the fact that there are a billion different slight variations of potions you'll never use because the fights are so easy.  Also many quest items are bugged and will permanently suck up your inventory space, yuck.The minigames are just dumb time wasters.  There are two to unlock chests, the lockpicking mostly is just holding a key down and waiting as the default position will unlock a chest most of the time.  The dispelling of a chest is slightly more interesting but quickly becomes tiresome on the far far too common chests.Outside of the main quest line and faction quests, which are good, there isn't a lot of variety with most being go to spot X on the map and kill a bunch of things and come back.  The pirate DLC quest series is a standout and if you do decide to get this game (don't) and make it to Rathir then pick up the ""Legend"" DLC as it is as good if not better than the main game.This could have been a pretty awesome game with some tweaking but the good bits are buried under way too much tiresome muck you need to shovel through.

												Unfortunately I have to say I'm a bit disappointed with this game. It's not a bad game, but it's just not great. Usually I like to play a game a bit more before submitting a review - but playing longer than the 3 hours I have logged already just felt like a chore (I honestly felt like I had already put 10 hours - much to my surprise!). I want to really like it and it has many of the components I really enjoy in RPG games. The combat is certainly the best part of this game and is quite fun - but too easy. The dialogue is not very inspiring, but the voice acting I think is actually pretty good...I was surprised by the number of characters with actual voice overs. But funny enough, the one character in the entire game that has no voice acting is your own! So in every conversation it shows you standing there like a mute - it's a bit awkward. There are lots of quests but they too are relatively mundane. As you explore the world - and to be fair I didn't explore all that much - it's quite empty. The graphics are dated and mobs you kill ragdoll all the time, which really takes away from the immersion. Some people have made comparisons of this game to Dark Souls, which I don't think is a fair comparison at all. Yes they are both RPGs and have action style combat, but they have very different game styles. This is closer I think to the Witcher series - but that's a very hard series to beat in terms of gameplay and story. This game definitely shares a lot of features with Skyrim too, but the graphics and the story are not nearly as compelling. I guess the best way to describe this game is that it shares a lot of game mechanics with other very popular RPGs, but doesn't quite execute them quite as well. I was lucky and picked this up for $6 on a Steam Sale so I don't feel to bad. I may come back to it at a future time if I have nothing else to play, but I'd be hard pressed to recommend this game since there are others that are very close but much better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had been looking forward to playing Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning for quite some time. The action-RPG style was very appealing as most combat in this genre is point-and-click clunkiness. To my initially great pleasure, the combat was just as I expected, similar to Darksiders but as I played further, I found it to be very boring and repetitive. The same attack sequences, the same types of enemies, the same thing... over and over. So while the combat was good to start, it failed to hold my interest in the long run... even after unlocking the full tree.The stories (main and side) of KoA are extremely bland. Only towards the very end did the main story line get somewhat interesting then it felt completely rushed and overlooked in the interest of ending the story. If you play RPGs for a deep story, you will not find it here.I was very disappointed to find a level cap of 40. If you most of the side quests, you will hit this well before the end-game. Sure you can respec any try a different playstyle or character build but in the end, you will still be maxed at 40 which truly only allows for one specialization.The amazing choice/consequence of alternative games was non-existent in KoA. You have dialogue options but none that really affect the story or outcome... so while the game says you decide your fate, this is hardly the case.Graphically, the game looked decent. Some of the textures (especially grass) looked awful but it ran very smoothly. Music was good and very fitting.The crafting aspect allows you to create any kind of weapon/amor you want. This is a pretty nice feature as it does allow you to customize gear according to your playstyle.On the plus side, the DLC (Teeth of Naros and Dead Kel) were both excellent. They are fully developed and not quick to complete. Both were definitely worth the extra money.Overall, I was disappointed with KoA. The repetitive nature and linear choice/story made for a bland experience. My rating is 6.5/10.			",149,35,1,22,7,1,24

												I ALMOST recommend this game with strong reservations. If you can find it cheap, it's a good way to waste a few hours. The accent here is on waste, though. It's not particularly fun after the first few hours and you quickly realize it's all exactly the same. Once you get higher level, there's... nothing. There's no THERE there. The game is incredibly shallow. There are a number of very enjoyable elements:Character customizationAction-combatWell-flushed, if very vanilla, worldCrafting system is an excellent idea, if badly implemented in late gameThe problem is that the game is entirely too large. It should have either been much shorter or had a much larger variety in the mechanics. Once you get high level the whole thing's BORING. You cakewalk through quest after quest and get the same unhelpful rewards. The ""oh boy I found the next tier of gear"" effect is quickly lost and the entire thing just gets old. Money quickly becomes a waste when you're making all your own gear based on what you loot off monsters.Basically, the whole game is very unimaginative. I know now why it didn't sell as well as the developers needed it to. It's just meh.TLDR: 6.5/10 - Starts out great and quickly becomes dull.			",123,61,1,57,16,0,17

												I tried to get into it, I really did, but it just feels... wrong. I've heard before that Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning was a failed attempt at an MMO and I'm afraid it shows. Between monsters constantly spawning up and quests being largely inconsequential I can't help but feel I'm playing a single player MMO. The combat is obviously what is going to bring in most people and it is entertaining but it gets really old really quick. As if that isn't bad enough the level up system follows that bad system that keeps getting thrown around where you only buff up a few things by a couple percents for every point *cough*Borderlands*cough*. I don't give a damn if I now have 3% to crit as opposed to 2.5%, I want to feel like that 1 point can completely change my character. Instead of busting out an abacus to figure out which percent is better to raise I should be able to tilt my head back and ask myself ""How do I wanna ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥up today?"".tl;dr it's a failed attempt at an rpg, give it a pass unless it's on a huge sale and the combat really grabs you			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was only able to play 26 hours of this game before i uninstalled it. I really tried to get into it, but there are a few things that just really got on my nerves me and makes it unenjoyable. My main issue with it is the camera. You are stuck looking directly over the shoulder of the character with no way to zoom out and its extremely frustrating. I like to have the control to zoom out further and this honestly seems like such a simple fix, I am surprised that it hasnt been included in the game yet through some patch. I guess developers don't care. maybe it was because they didnt spend much time on the maps and you would be zooming through objects, i dunno.I tried the widescreenfix program on many different settings and to get zoomed out to the point I enjoy it around 100-110 degrees, the image is so fisheyed and distorted. That and it has issues phasing have to constantly keep resetting it with the hotkey etc. Honestly, just comes down to the fact that the majority of my gameplay seems to be focused on getting a nice camera vantage and less about the game itself. The widescreenfix is really not meant for this, its meant more for spreading games out onto multiple displays. The fix should of been implemented by the developers and seeing that people have been complaining about this since it's release, that's just disappointing.I was not drawn into the story. Seems like a cool premise, but the quests are rather boring and the landscape and dungeons honestly start to feel the same, I've cleared the majority of the western map, including its dungeons now and there's different textures and what not, but I feel like i'm just running down a tunnel everywhere i go. I have no issue with linear maps, dragon age was a great example of how linear maps can still be done right, but these are just dull. I just didn't feel attached to the lore and the world. Combat is kinda cool. Similar to guildwars 2 in that you get different attacks based on weapons. Spells come from talents. I enjoyed the combat.Fast travel system is nice, but there are still some dungeons that are really large and you can't fast travel from within them, so you must run to the exit. Spend 5-10 min doing that some times. mehmight be good for some, but honestly I just uninstalled it cuz of the camera. That seriously killed it for me. Fans probably can turn a cheek to it.

												Ok Everyone who loves this game and planded on Crytisysing me for my choice of words about this this game cuzz they knew what i said was rong. Fair game. I just started i got ahead of my self and jumped to conclusions story is anoying yes gameplay is good unlike what i said.  It was kinda stuped at first but i gess it just took geting used to. But after a wile it actualy got me prity entressted. So those who love this game and knew my Revew was fals if u guys dident crytisys me for it out of kindness its open game for u guys. Everyone els who hasent played well u got no room to talk even less than me infact. lols Over all The combat is kinda Ify  its hardly a challange unless u turn up the Difficulty but Even then it can be off ballance. Why u ask? The World in wich u are playing is desined like a MMO's world for some reasion. With areas stronger then others if u go to far out ur too week if u go to far in ur to strong. its rather anoying sence theres is not anyreasion the game cant ajust to one persons charicter becose its singleplayer. As for the swiming u can swim in certan areas. Agien i jumped to conclusions. For me its the Enteraction that makes a Openworld RPG and Tip Craft ur armor if ur a warrior. Oh shops do change once u aquier a home from a village being attacked by spiders ull know it when u see it. by the way. They dont change level just invintory. :)			",62,5,0,18,5,0,12

												#not impressed. GAME IS NOTHING LIKE FABLE - many people claimed that this was a game very similar to Fable. However they forget to mention its nothing like fable. Fable is a very richly created game with in depth areas to explore. This game however feels like alot less than that. It feels like Fable to some people because it mirrors or copies all of Fable the originals strengths. Yet again it doesnt improve anything. It actually takes away a lot of the fun nods that Fables combat offers. This game is for the faint at heart. Those that want to quickly smash through levels and complete a game. It is not for those that want a rich story with fun combat that never gets old. This combat system is way to simple. Fable series is better off witout any of this dont believe the myths that this game is somehow a lost link to Fable. Decent game but not anywhere near the hype.			",17,1,0,4,0,0,0

												Kingdom of Amalur:Reckoning is a game that isn't special in any way, shape or form. At first it was designed to be an MMORPG, which shows in its world design. Sadly this design is completely uninspired, having different areas connecting awkwardly with a linear dungeon every here and then.Due to trying to be an MMORPG at first it is filled with a WoW-esque cartoony artstyle, minus the talent that was present in let's say WoW vanilla, TBC and WotLK.Even at its highest difficulty, ""hard"", this is a game with zero difficulty. Primarily caused by the fact that you attack very fast, hit hard and have a great reach with most weapons. Secondarily caused by a gimmick that many games have, you, as the main character, receive some nonsense overpowered abilities that no enemy in the game can actually do anything against.  So even if you somehow find an enemy that you can't stunlock in this game, you can just activate your power which slows down time and makes you hit harder to stunlock it anyways.But by all means, if you're interested in a game with a forgettable art style, boring story, combat so easy that you can hardly call it a game, poor voice acting, poor dungeon and world design, then this is the game for you.

http://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/991142-kingdoms-of-amalur-reckoning/reviews/review-153084I wrote a long review on the game a while back. But my short version is that it was one of teh most underrated games of 2012. A lot of people overlooked it an dismissed it as ""generic"" or ""boring"" but compared to all the other fantasy action RPGs, this one was actually a blast to play. Top notch combat, lots of side quests, 3 totally different character classes with support for hybrid classes with my favorite being the Jack Of All Trades, Legend Of Dead Kel was one of the best DLC expansions I've played period, and it's a very large expansive world. What is there to hate?			",195,74,4,23,7,3,21

												Overall its a decent game but I'm still saying you should avoid this game like the plague because its got quite a few game breaking bugs which don't allow you to progress in some quests and a couple known bugs that prevent story quests from progressing. Only known fix is to load an older save but even thats not a garuntee to fix this game breaking bugs.I had TWO god damn playthroughs ended because of the same bug and each time I loaded probably 20 to 30 different saves for each character and still encountered those bugs which I couldn't avoid.Go spend your $20 on Fable the Lost Chapters if you want a good RPG which does have some bugs all of them can be dealt with or fixed easily unlike in this game.

												This game deserves a 10, but I can see people arguing a 9.5.*I have considerably more hours into this game than a vast majority of people who wrote reviews. Negatives:	-First two hours of the game are slow.-Do not play this if you can't stand dialogue because there is a lot in this game. -Bugs-as with every game. There was one bug where I was stuck in one place, tried everything to move but it didn't work. I restarted, loaded that previous save, and I was still stuck. Important: THIS IS WHY YOU SHOULD HAVE MULTIPLE SAVE POINTS-which is what I thankfully had, in addition to autosave. There's another bug with the House of Sorrows quest line (which is like a faction). If you leave the castle before accepting all of the quests (including the main faction's quest), you'll get locked out. I googled it for a solution after being locked out and people suggested keeping the heartstone key. If you destroy it, you're screwed. Luckily, I kept the key in my stash. Unfortunately, that solution didn't even work. iIeven tried equipping it-nope. Locked out of that questline still. My most recent save to where I'm able to access that questline is like five hours back from where I currently am. So I'm forced to choose between sacrificing five hours of gameplay just to be able to access that storyline, or foregoing it altogether to keep/maintain those five hours of gameplay. (Minor): -When buying in bulk, it doesn't show you the total dollars. This is basic in rpg games. It only has a slider for the quantity you want to buy, not the total amount in gold/dollars. Despite these, the positives far outweigh and overshadow any of this.  Positives: +Bang for your buck. Remarkably, there is so much content in this game. I thought this was going to be a 20-30 hour game-tops. Steam counter has me at 85 hours (not counting 6 hours offline)-and I haven't even completed many of the side or even main quests or even the ""Legend of Dead Kel"" dlc.+The most beautiful scenery I've ever seen, and I've played Skyrim. There were multiple moments where I was amazed.+The dialogue is so good and reflective/philosophical and poetic.+The story line is original (ex: The story of Edgar Aron in Apotyre (the underdog going against the giant Motus Mining corporation) goes almost the opposite with it).+The weapons are cooler than I expected. +Impressively fast loading screens (compare to many other games) to the point where you can't finish reading the hint texts on the screen. +Variety in play style. You don't have to choose between being a rogue (finesse), a mage (sorcery) or a warrior (might), in the ""destinies"" section, you can actually be a hybrid of the two if you select talents from your two favorite play styles.+Voice acting which 90% of rpg players ♥♥♥♥♥ about wanting, despite how expensive it can be for game studios to include. Conclusion:  Put aside my strong endorsement to buy the game, I want to add reasons why this game was not successful:1) On the outside, it's viewed by many (I admit to initially thinking this myself) as off putting due to its generic feel. It's viewed as a ""generic"" and cheesy rpg/fantasy game with no soul, no originality, no new contributions to the genre.2) Scary PR. Untold millions price tag+not enough initial buyers to break even, let alone make a profit (needed 2-3 million buyers)=developing company (38 Studios) goes bankrupt=perception of a horrible game=throwing money away.3) Also, with a bankrupted studio, most people thought, ""why emotionally invest in this one game, if there's a good chance we aren't getting a sequel/continuation of the franchise (which is a real shame)?""

												I want to like this but the camera is just plain awful. When you aren't in combat it's too close to the character so that you can't see a thing going on around you, and when you are in combat it tries to zoom out to give you a good perspective but often your character will just go off the screen. Often in the game I was just spamming buttons because I couldn't even see myself or the enemies. It's terrible at following the character and hard to put up with for a game that has hundreds of hours it expects me to sit through.			",231,47,0,23,19,2,8

												A solid RPG with a huge open world and loads to do.Lot's of customization options for your character, many gearing and skill tree options.Typical run-of-the-mill main story with a twist. I personally loved the whole idea of not having your fate written thing.Combat is great but sometimes frustrating but that's only because if you get hit by anything it interrupts whatever you're doing. Great graphics immerse you in the game world.I really hope to see a sequel one day.			",239,31,3,27,43,0,32

												I played Dark Souls and i feel like this game has similar dodge mechanism but this game is easy.The first boss fight was too easy and the NPCs are easy to kill, that means timing or using your dodge does not mean life or death. Although it is a good game i just don't feel like playing this now but for those RPG fans this is a game worth a try.			",89,3,1,9,9,0,12

												I realize that I played through this entire game and its DLCs and even went so far as to get 100% of the achievements, but I just cannot recommend it. It's not all negative, it's just... boring. And it shouldn't be. The environments should be mind blowing. The character design should be good. The weapons and armor designs should be interesting. But, they just... aren't. They are by themselves out of context. The screenshots and such for this game make it look really interesting and captivating. But when you are playing, everything is really bland text-book fantasy cliche and so all these things that look really nice out of context become dull and boring when put together as a whole in the context of the game. Also, the crafting system sucks and doesn't seem to make any weapons or armor better than what you can find in the game. Also, the random loot system sucks: you find a piece of a named armor set, but by the time you randomly get all of the pieces or even enough for it's cumulative effects to be useful, you've leveled up way beyond it and have found generic armor beyond its capabilities. And, I'm not sure if it is possible to make sidequests any more generic, boring, and repetitive. The gameplay itself and combat are fine, I guess. So, bad crafting, bad loot, extremely meh gameplay, nothing special combat, and incredibly dull cliche story and characters make this game just plain boring. If you are looking for a fantasy world to explore, you'd be much better of going and wandering around Skyrim again.			",380,74,10,28,16,1,21

												Dear Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning™,sorry for ragequitting you after i hit the gamebreaking bug in legend of dead kel dlc. It really wasn’t your fault, it was mine. Why must i have kept overriding the same saveslot all the time? Burdening you like that… You’re but a piece of software, you have your flaws, i understand that now.What i’m writing here might sound really hard to you, so i want to tell you in advance that there were quite some aspects of you i really enjoyed. You‘ve got a large collection of unique gear, a fun combat system and an artstyle many will find quite appealing. Haven’t stuck with you that long for no reason, eh?Still i can’t give you a positive review. I know we spent over 130 hours together and sure it was fun at first, but the grind just caught up way to quick. After exploring few of your regions i felt like i’ve already seen all there is to be seen. And when you strated recycling former bosses as common mobs i began to ask myself wether you really got what it takes to be such a huge open world rpg. In fact i wondered wether you actually understood what being an open world rpg meant in the first place. I know you need to set up your lines, can’t let me go where i want from the start. But the way you lead me through your ever boring regions, made me crawl through every single one of them, like a dog on a leash. That’s just not what open world means for me.More than that, you never really let me be myself. Sure it was nice of you to let me respec whenever i felt like it, but, well, this couldn’t really make up for how linear building my character felt. „Choose one of the three skilltrees“, „stick with it if you want to max it“, „only wear gear that fits your skilltree“… sorry to say that, but the way you made me spec and gear my char was really lame. And talking bout being myself: naming me the fateless one, who can do whatever the fudge he feels like in a world of predestination, and then never letting me make a singe decision that actually would have changed a tiny bit about the story is a really cheap move.The story, ah yes the story. Bet you feel like the story was unique, like everybody thinks his own story is unique. I tell you something, it isn’t, it is predictable like it is predictable that the writer of a review, that pretends to be a letter to the game it’s reviewing, will at one point break the fourth wall and make obvious that he is actually quite aware of the fact that he is indeed writing a review and not a letter. And i’m not even talking about your sidestories here. No, talking about your sidestories would only remind me of how that lazy npc wanted my max level fateless one, most important person in the whole fantasy universe, to deliver his stupid letters because he himself felt more like drinking some ale and having a good time. And that would only make me want to ragequit you again.Well maybe, afterall, it’s because you’re just not designed to be with a single player. Maybe i just wasn’t enough for you. You need a whole server of players, running over you, somtimes i really felt that, found you were lifeless and empty. I just cannot live up to this need of yours, i cannot replace a whole community of roleplayers, i hope you understand that.Giving you 4.5 out of 10Your whatever my steamtag is atmTL;DR: This game is a cheap bi*ch that promises you a huge open world rpg for 20 bucks but hardly delivers enough content to fill a 15 hour adventure game. Still, fun combat and some rewarding loot. If you want to have a peek, get her it on sale.NOTE: There is in fact a gamebreaking bug in legend of dead kel dlc. Make a backup save before you enter the boss dungeon. (And yes, it really broke my savegame i invested over 100 hours in)			",54,30,0,57,13,1,27

												I would  like to give this game a positive review.  For all the good points, please go read any of the many positive reviews.  I agree with most the other reviewers' points concerning sound, combat, UI, etc.  There are two reasons this gets a thumbs down from me.  1)  Remapping keys doesn't work.  Well, it does, sort of.  You can add new keys to binds, but you can't remove the old ones.  The default key bindings don't go away when you make new binds, and there's no way I've found to fix that, and if you bind a new function to a default-bound key, you get the default bind plus the new bind.  EG, by default SHIFT is used for blocking.  If you bind sprint to SHIFT, it will now block and sprint, mutually exclusive functions since you can't move while blocking.  Yeesh.  And yeah, ""block"" is on the SHIFT key and sprint is on the CTRL key.  Double yeesh.  You know what games use SHIFT for sprint?  EVERY OTHER @#$% GAME EVER MADE.  Fortunately you can use a controler, which is the option I went with, rather than messing with decades of muscle memory.  The second reason I'm thumbs-downing this game is because, on Windows 10, on certain boxes, it crashes to desktop randomly and without warning.  A search of the net led me to a horde of disappointed gamers with the same issue.  The usual tricks, running in compatibility mode, disconecting peripherals (the game goes loopy if you've got a graphics tablet plugged in) didn't help me, and since the devs are no longer, there will be no patches.  I'd hoped, in vain, for a 3rd party patch, but couldn't find one.  From what I have seen during my anywhere-from-five-minutes-to-an-hour-before-crashing game sessions, the game looks great.  It would be nice if it was playable.			",108,76,0,37,10,1,16

												I don't know exactly why the three hours I played this game felt like three weeks, but it did, and it wasn't fun. It might be the MMO world which de-emphasizes any build-up to an interest in the story, or it might be that most of the NPCs have a large list of pointless conversation pieces telling me the exact same thing that another NPC just told me (none of which matter or are interesting). It might also be because when they introduce an NPC with some amount of potential, like Agarth, he just sends me on an errand and sits back. I do know that some degree of the not-fun has to do with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Skyrim-esque skills, which are neither fun nor intuitive - I'd rather not put points in lockpick because I'd rather never have to do it. Also, how do you farm an herb and get zero materials? Am I eating the plants as I'm farming them? Am I farming them with a flamethrower and rendering them unusable? Talk about unsatisfying.Either way, the game emphasized all the negative aspects of an MMO - grinding and pointless fighting, uninspired dungeon design (because, again, it is endless hack and slash, not anything inventive), a story that felt both non-urgent and uninteresting, and a host of mini-game mechanics, like a dumbed down lockpicking mechanic, that make the game more laborious than fun.If you wanna play an MMO, just choose one of the free ones with an interesting story or mechanics (at least in an MMO I have abilities to spice up combat). There just isn't much reason to play this compared to what else is out there.			",55,5,0,18,2,1,3

												Big Huge Games should change their name to Big Huge Empty Games. The game played amazing for the first two hours, but then quickly devolved into feeling like a cheap mmo with no people. The world was artistically baren with an extra drought for interest. Repetitive enemies, boss fights, NPC's, side-quests, scenery, etc. cripple this game beyond redemption, not to mention the extensive overuse of particle effects and vasalensing. This game is all hype and no substance. Recommended alternative: Darksiders, which uses the same game engine and peripherals, but has so, so much more to offer. And if you've already played it, play it again.			",154,61,0,27,8,0,12

												I don't know exactly why the three hours I played this game felt like three weeks, but it did, and it wasn't fun. It might be the MMO world which de-emphasizes any build-up to an interest in the story, or it might be that most of the NPCs have a large list of pointless conversation pieces telling me the exact same thing that another NPC just told me (none of which matter or are interesting). It might also be because when they introduce an NPC with some amount of potential, like Agarth, he just sends me on an errand and sits back. I do know that some degree of the not-fun has to do with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Skyrim-esque skills, which are neither fun nor intuitive - I'd rather not put points in lockpick because I'd rather never have to do it. Also, how do you farm an herb and get zero materials? Am I eating the plants as I'm farming them? Am I farming them with a flamethrower and rendering them unusable? Talk about unsatisfying.Either way, the game emphasized all the negative aspects of an MMO - grinding and pointless fighting, uninspired dungeon design (because, again, it is endless hack and slash, not anything inventive), a story that felt both non-urgent and uninteresting, and a host of mini-game mechanics, like a dumbed down lockpicking mechanic, that make the game more laborious than fun.If you wanna play an MMO, just choose one of the free ones with an interesting story or mechanics (at least in an MMO I have abilities to spice up combat). There just isn't much reason to play this compared to what else is out there.			",55,5,0,18,2,1,3

Weapons can NOT be Drawn, hence they can NOT be swung OR fired. I wish I had read this review before I had written it. In answer to your questions: Yes, I checked that first thing.

												So, you'll notice that I didn't invest much time in this game.  It was suggested by a friend when I was needing a new game to play, so I added it to my wishlist and waited for it to go on sale.When I finally was able to play it, I made it through part of the opening quest.  The story seemed captivating enough...but the controls are *so unintuitive* that I just can't play the game.  There is no strafe with q/e, you cannot move with clicking of the mouse, the camera feels overly sensitive.  Not really pleased, would have rather used the money on another game :(			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game seemed to strive for the depth characteristic of the Elder Scrolls games, but it came off as cheap and simple. The story was forgettable and most of the characters were as well. The combat was entertaining up until I hit my level cap, then it was nothing more than an annoyance as enemies were no longer the slightest bit challenging. Even the final boss was simple to defeat while losing no more than maybe 10% of my health. I hit my level cap roughly half-way through my playtime (120 hours, including Dead Kel and Teeth of Naros DLC).The biggest annoyance was the lockpicking. The controls are not fined-tuned at all, so it's nearly impossible to pick with actual skill, even when working on a lowest level lock with a fully leveled lockpicking skill. The auto-picking uses up a lockpick, even if your skill grants you a 100% chance of succeeding. Unforunately, you don't find enough lockpicks to go auto-picking everything unless you purchase lockpicks at every opportunity.			",329,73,0,40,18,2,34

												Combat is not revolutionary or more interesting than any other RPG - In fact it's much more linear. Combat is not better just because I can spam buttons and things will happen. You don't even have to aim the bow ffs. The melee attacks are ""aimed"" using vague directions of which way to swing. The interface is clunky and irritating to deal with. The button mappings are restrictive and unintuitive. The fact that this game used to be $50 astounds me considering the low quality of development - I paid $10 for it on a Steam sale and I feel that was too much.			",83,4,1,16,7,0,5

												From content standpoint this game likely merits a 90/100 score. its big it has a lot of stuff and quest and tons of voice acting everywhere, the artist are very creative, and it looks good, the game engine is suitably powerful and technically better than its competitor Divinity 2. its a very playable game. But......I did not really enjoy playing it. I played about 92 hours, so its very playable or I wouldn't waste 1 hour with it. For I have no reason except the enjoyment of the experience (there may be some other reasons... but thats mainly what one plays a game for).The main story isn't all that great. I never felt drawn into the lavish story line. The character are all meaningless, one never ever cares anything for any of them. I think the literary elements are destroyed by the open ended questing system (I would have closed the questing system so it must be played in a certain order. This would have helped much to draw people in to the experience). There is never any sense that anything matters at all anywhere in the world.The inventory and character management system works, but I would say a patch should have fixed its crudeness. It should have been easy for such skilled developers to polish this system as it's so important to any game of any genre.But my number one gripe by far for this game is the camera. I just don't want to play it anymore because I am sick to death of staring at my characters backside while I play. The camera is just terrible. All one ever does when playing is stare at the ground and at your characters backside. This should have been fixed immediately. It is the easiest thing to fix. Divinity 2 does a much much much better job with the camera. Though Skyrim V is the best and most popular of the genre I think. These sort of games need a first person perspective. The camera view is half the game.There are other things too of course. But my other serious issues pertain to genre and game development descisions on a broader level, so to say, these sorts of problem are simply the norm right now. So I won't bother talking about them. I'll try to judge this game against its competitors, not because I have too but because I want too.  If a developer reads this, -----------------FIX THE CAMERA!-------------------- The quest camera which locks the camera onto the face of NPC's whenever there is something to talk about in the game is also annoying, and would be better if it was more semi-iso-metric. The NPC's faces look stupid and wooden and I hate looking at them. I want to throw rocks at them and poke them with sharp things while they speak. Games have always been stupid, idiotic non-sensical rubbish. One of the greatest in history involved single handly traveling to hell, completely alone, wading through hordes of incredible murderous demons. For a bunny rabbit...  Literally...I think this game takes itself wayyyyyyyy too seriously. For the level of literary wit it possesses. It wants to be super great and legendary, but its just isn't.... Its obvious the developers don't know much about anything, its just money, and that what they needed to remember in there case. They just want to make money and care nothing about all these extremely serious issues they talk about, that have nothing to do with money at all. In other words it would have been smarter to go more stupid rather than try elevate the genre up to a level serious literature. Why doesn't our hero just chase some♥♥♥♥♥into hell for all it matters. That would work much better.Is it possible to create a game masterpiece? Will the game world one day have its truly great playwright(s)? Probably. But Kingdoms of Amalur deffinately ain't it.I talk like this because there is a whole lot of talking and acting in this game and a huge heavey duty ultra-serious life and death and the meaning of everything and more than that too - plot in the game. Which is  why I mention playwrights, and am refering to high quality richly respected writers in general. There is a  real desire in the game that is obvious, to raise the medium of gaming out of its non-sensical idiot past, and make something really great. But in my opinion this effort eats turf. I give this game a 60/100Bottomline: if the developers fix the camera I would say one can have fun playing this amusing bit of rubbish. Theres tons of special effects and environments and tools and weapons and beasts and battle skills to use - though the death physics are terrible, but standard in the industry. I get no satisfaction from killing monsters at all. Where is the decapitation, the slicing in two, the smashing to bloody hamburger special effects. There is nothing, its unbearable to me. This game is so full of unholy filthiness and cruel unhumanity smashing the damn things to bits is the only enjoyment I get from playing and it isn't there, nothing - otherwise give it a pass. Actually just give this game pass. The market is soo bloated with options, players need to discriminate. No Affirmative Action for Amalur, time to move on. Time is valuable.			",25,4,0,4,2,0,2

												Great game, but overall, it needs patch updates for bugs and glitches within the game. Bugs that prevent you from progressing further in the game. Steam should put warning labels on games that are not patched.			",34,3,0,12,16,0,21

												So, you'll notice that I didn't invest much time in this game.  It was suggested by a friend when I was needing a new game to play, so I added it to my wishlist and waited for it to go on sale.When I finally was able to play it, I made it through part of the opening quest.  The story seemed captivating enough...but the controls are *so unintuitive* that I just can't play the game.  There is no strafe with q/e, you cannot move with clicking of the mouse, the camera feels overly sensitive.  Not really pleased, would have rather used the money on another game :(			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game seemed to strive for the depth characteristic of the Elder Scrolls games, but it came off as cheap and simple. The story was forgettable and most of the characters were as well. The combat was entertaining up until I hit my level cap, then it was nothing more than an annoyance as enemies were no longer the slightest bit challenging. Even the final boss was simple to defeat while losing no more than maybe 10% of my health. I hit my level cap roughly half-way through my playtime (120 hours, including Dead Kel and Teeth of Naros DLC).The biggest annoyance was the lockpicking. The controls are not fined-tuned at all, so it's nearly impossible to pick with actual skill, even when working on a lowest level lock with a fully leveled lockpicking skill. The auto-picking uses up a lockpick, even if your skill grants you a 100% chance of succeeding. Unforunately, you don't find enough lockpicks to go auto-picking everything unless you purchase lockpicks at every opportunity.			",329,73,0,40,18,2,34

												This is a very well made and refined game, but I just find it hard to enjoy with so much better RPG's readily available in the same price range. The game is extremely repetitive and the ""revolutionary combat"" is nothing more then countless hours of button mashing. The NPC's were not engaging or unique and offered poor and repetitive quests.  Now don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad game, but for the 20$ price tag I would have expected much more out of this game. For a game that competes against both Dark Souls and Skyrim, this game falls short in almost every aspect. However the one thing this game does have going for it is it's reliability, it has very smooth frame rates and has never crashed on me. All in all, spend your hard earned cash on Dark souls, Skyrim or even Mount and Blade, not this generic button masher.			",132,10,2,13,5,1,8

												Combat is not revolutionary or more interesting than any other RPG - In fact it's much more linear. Combat is not better just because I can spam buttons and things will happen. You don't even have to aim the bow ffs. The melee attacks are ""aimed"" using vague directions of which way to swing. The interface is clunky and irritating to deal with. The button mappings are restrictive and unintuitive. The fact that this game used to be $50 astounds me considering the low quality of development - I paid $10 for it on a Steam sale and I feel that was too much.			",83,4,1,16,7,0,5

												the game is good but the coding is awful its a buggy mess such a shame because it showed promise after the first 30 lvls into the game but now i can't start the damn game it crashes before it starts and now i have to fix it myself. buy it with a discount and that's only if you are curious about what it has to offer other than that don't bother			",47,10,0,11,1,0,6

												after around 30 hours of gameplay i came across a game breaking glitch. the quest her rightous fury stops you from fast traveling. which makes getting supplies or doing quests a very big pain. i literally have no will to finish this by running everywhere with a map that isnt exactly small. if only i looked this up i would of avoided this. but then again i thought a game this old would at least have its glithes fixed! im so disappointed and very upset cause i was looking forward to playing this game for a while			",50,41,0,12,16,0,3

												The game is beautiful; the money spent on acting and emoting is top notch.  Unfortunately, its just boring.  If you like a seek and find adventure where you are put into a whole new story this is your game.  If you are wanting something that hooks you and drives your character to go and do things you may want to look elsewhere.			",150,23,4,12,5,1,9

												I had a quest: Go to some witch in the woods and get a potion for dying someone. Well the potion could have been purchased from merchant next door instead. And this game is full of brilliant quests like that!Pros: -	Some impressive combat system. You do really feel powerful with your big, fancy sword.-	Items and levelling system were alright-	World looks okayCons:-	Shallowness of entire game.-	Plastic dialogues-	Dull quests-	Mediocre graphics-	Boring gameplay (except for combat)My rating: 2.50/10			",67,31,1,27,4,0,28
